Title: "Episode 237 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player"

10th Wave

In the past, Ryu Min had to gather information on the subordinates to capture Pelseba.

Nicknames, habits, way of speaking, behavior, face, personality, occupation, runes, etc.

If there was any information to gather and use, Ryu Min utilized it.

Even the fact that he was leveraging the identity of Lostyak was thanks to the information he obtained at that time.

Remembering the nickname of a Pelseba officer was not a difficult task for Ryu Min.

'A casual mukbang. Definitely one of the eight Pelseba officers.'

Although he hadn't been visible since a certain episode, in the early stages, he was undoubtedly one of the individuals leading Pelseba.

'That guy survived until this round.'

Ryu Min thought he might be skilled in his own way, but it didn't matter.

What was suspicious was that he avoided meeting Ryu Min's eyes.

'I need to check it out.'

Approaching closer, Ryu Min read the guy's inner thoughts.

Even though he had his back turned, just by looking at his head, Ryu Min could delve into his thoughts.

'That son of a...'

Ryu Min made a rare surprised expression.

'The one who received the fortune of the Archangel?'

He didn't know that the Archangel would use such an insignificant player without appearing personally.

But what was truly surprising was the method.

'To strip someone of their qualifications by moving them to heaven...'

Ryu Min only now learned that it was possible to be stripped of qualifications.

Since he had never been to heaven and this was the first time he had been threatened with assassination by the Archangels in this episode.

'If you get warped to heaven, there's no way to go back, no matter how hard you try.'

Unable to do anything and just spending time in heaven, eventually losing qualifications.

'Stripping of qualifications...'

What does it mean for qualifications as a player to be stripped away?

Does it mean losing all the power of the system? Or does it simply mean being excluded from the survival game?

'It's probably the former.'

Considering what was said about being able to return as an ordinary person, it likely means losing all the power possessed as a player.

"It's definitely a threatening method. I understand why the Archangels didn't directly intervene."

Ryu Min cast a wary glance at the casual mukbang with a calculating look.

"If you memorize the spell in the book given by the Archangels and recite it, you can be forcibly moved, right?"

The reason the guy was evasive became clear to Ryu Min.

He had been eyeing the opportunity to receive instructions from the Archangels and be sent to heaven.

"He must have planned to take advantage of the confusion among people in the 10th wave."

Ryu Min wasn't interested in knowing what ill feelings this former Pelseba officer had towards him, and it wasn't necessary.

"Anyway, the fact that he's targeting me is what matters."

Now that he knew the method, he could handle it.

"Killing him would be simple, but the problem is that he's a party member."

There is no way to kill a party member.

He could only wait for the round to end, but he might be the one eliminated before that.

"I can't let that happen."

Ryu Min thought of a solution and checked the remaining time.

[Time until the next wave: 00:17:41]

It seemed he could deal with it before the wave started.

"Yamti."

"Oh, Black Scythe? Do you have something to ask of me?"

"There's someone you should dominate."

"Who?"

Ryu Min gestured with his eyes.

"Do you see over there? The nickname is 'Casual Mukbang.'"

"Casual Mukbang...?"

Yamti's eyes widened like a rabbit's.

"That inconspicuous guy is still alive?"

"Do you know him?"

"Yes. He was a Pelseba officer like me."

"Dominate him. Since there's no room, release Jeffrey from domination."

"Well, that seems unlikely."

"Why?"

Yamti, looking flustered, sighed and spoke.

"I dominated him once before. I tried to extract information from Casual Mukbang..."

Once dominated, a target released from domination cannot be dominated again.

It meant the opportunity was lost.

Yamti bowed her head as if in apology.

"...I'm sorry."

"No, it was before we met, so it's fine."

If domination wasn't an option, another approach was needed.

A person came to Ryu Min's mind just at the right moment.

"I dominated four slaves before."

"Members of the Messiah?"
ChatGPT

"Alright. Issue the order to them right away. What to say..."

Yamti, after hearing the explanation, nodded.

"Do you mean I just need to oppress them as you said?"

"Yes. But you have to secretly approach without him noticing. He might escape."

Why oppress Casual Mukbang? Ryu Min was curious, but Yamti was a slave. She would do anything her master asked.

"Understood. I'll execute it immediately."

"Wow... That was close."

Casual Mukbang, facing Black Scythe, felt a chill down his spine.

Just by looking at his eyes, he could tell something was trembling, probably because the confrontation was imminent.

"Did he... perhaps not notice?"

Glancing back, Casual Mukbang saw that Black Scythe was focused on something else.

Luckily, it seemed he hadn't been caught.

"Phew, I almost ruined it before handling the business."

Now, in just 10 minutes, the 10th wave would begin. The plan was to act when people and Black Scythe were confused, as foretold by the Archangel.

"Whew, no need to be scared. It's a simple task. Hide in the crowd, approach when there's an opportunity, present the book, recite the spell. That's it. See, it's simple, right?"

By doing so, he could send away the unpleasant Black Scythe to a place he would never return fromâ€”the heavenly realm.

"Good. I'll prepare to move in about 3 minutes..."

That's when it happened.

Four men approached him like shadows.

"Hey, what's going on? Let go of this!"

Unable to resist as they grabbed his limbs, he was left speechless.

He tried to confirm their nicknames, thinking they might be familiar faces.

"Yangchowen, Jangsuowi, Darksoul, Spainyard...? I've never seen any of these guys before."

It was bewildering to be seized by complete strangers with no apparent connection.

"Let go of this, you bastards!"

"..."

Not uttering a word, and with expressions that showed no emotion, they executed orders like emotionless machines.

"Damn it! In the midst of dealing with the demon, who are these crazy people clinging onto me..."

Unable to deal damage to the party, it was maddening to have these strangers latching onto him just before facing the demon.
ChatGPT

"Hey. Excuse me. Why on earth are you doing this? What? I know? I don't know. Can't you tell me the reason for this sudden behavior? Yes?"

As expected, there was no response. In the end, he had no choice but to use force, but with four people holding onto him, his body felt as heavy as soaked cotton.

"What's going on? Why?"

"Are they clinging to one person, saying they'll take turns?"

"What kind of nonsense are they doing?"

"In this day and age, it's not shameful for same-sex relationships..."

"Do they really want to do this in another realm?"

"In a way, it's quite impressive, that guy."

Hearing murmurs from the surroundings, Mukbang shouted as if unjustly accused, "It's a misunderstanding! I don't know these guys at all!"

"Well, they seem to be really into you."

"I'm telling you, let go! Release me, you bastards!"

He struggled, but there was no way he could handle the strength of four people alone. Seeing no solution, he desperately called for help from those around him.

"Help! Strangers are grabbing me like this! Please, help me get them off!"

"Strangers?"

"Is that true?"

Some people were moved by his desperate plea, but only for a moment. The Messiah members, who had remained silent until now, spoke up one by one.

"I'll do better from now on."

"We were on good terms, right? Huh?"

"Mukbang, please don't leave me."

"I love you, bro."

The final words from Dark Soul seemed to be the decisive blow, causing the skeptical onlookers to turn away with twisted lips.

"Alright then."

"I was a fool to doubt for a moment."

Watching the departing people, Mukbang desperately shouted, "Hey, excuse me? I said they're strangers. Can someone please help!?"

"We won't interfere in other people's love affairs, so we'll leave now..."

"Have a good love."

People who initially thought it was just a happening distanced themselves from Mukbang.

In the end, the only people stuck to him like glue within a 10-meter radius were the four individuals.

Watching Mukbang, who became helpless due to the Messiah members, Ryu Min raised the corner of his mouth.

"I may not be able to kill them, but I can certainly make sure they can't move."

The command issued to the Messiah members was simple.
ChatGPT

To grab each limb of Casual Mukbang like glue.

Then, when there seemed to be a sign that people around might help, utter lines as if unable to forget a parted lover.

The effect was excellent.

Now, they couldn't do anything but glare at him, let alone approach him.

"With this, the threat has been neutralized."

One player, like a piece of trash, dared to scheme behind him.

"For now, I can't do anything because we're in a party, but I'll definitely settle the score after this round."

Having made up his mind, Ryu Min prepared for the 10th wave.

It would start soon.

The wave that would bring chaos.

"5, 4, 3, 2, 1..."

As the remaining time reached 0, the final wave was revealed.

[10th Wave] [4,608 Players vs 1 Parasitic Bug] [No time limit for this round.] [To clear the round, kill the Parasitic Bug!]

Players who saw the revealed mission blinked in disbelief.

"Facing just one?"

"A Parasitic Bug? Is it a boss-level creature?"

Until now, they had faced thousands, and at least a few hundred High Orcs, but facing just one opponent was a first.

"It's fine. What's the big deal? If 5,000 of us combine our strength, we can take it down, right?"

"That's right. Besides, we have Black Scythe."

However, players were perplexed right after seeing the next message.

[Special rules will be applied for balance adjustment.] [Special rules for the 10th Wave are undisclosed.]

"Undisclosed rules?"

While the opponent was revealed, the rules remained undisclosed.

It was bewildering, but soon those who regained their confidence had a thought.

Regardless of the rules, as long as Black Scythe was there, it shouldn't be a problem.

Even Ryu Min, the person involved, was confident.

Until he faced it head-on.

"Was it the 44th round? At that time, I ignorantly challenged a Parasitic Bug and died."

A time when he was full of confidence with his growing strength.

He challenged a Parasitic Bug without knowing anything about the special rules and died.

"In hindsight, it was quite foolish. I should have at least observed others and understood the nature of the rules... Well, even if I had done that, the outcome might not have changed."

The undisclosed special rules were as follows.

Reflect all damage.
ChatGPT

Whether it's physical or magical, any damage dealt to the Parasitic Bug is reflected back at the caster.

An astonishing 90% of the damage inflicted is returned.

"In the end, I have to withstand the returning 90% of the damage and face the Parasitic Bug with only 10% of the damage."

But, as easy as it sounds, it's not.

Unless you're a tank, who could withstand their own damage?

Especially for dealers specialized in attack power, the Parasitic Bug was practically a counter.

"It attached itself like a moth and died from its own damage. Thousands of players did."

There was no escaping the rule that damage was reflected, whether it was melee or ranged attacks.

Therefore, despite numerous players sticking to it, they couldn't defeat the Parasitic Bug, and later, they were busy recognizing the situation and fleeing.

Because they knew they would die if they foolishly challenged it.

"But you die even if you don't challenge it."

It was mentioned in the message, but the 10th wave had no time limit.

Running away wouldn't solve the problem.

There was no space to escape, blocked by a translucent barrier.

"Gruuuk, Gruuurg!"

A giant Parasitic Bug appeared in front of them.

A creature with a face resembling a frog and a tough insect-like exoskeleton, about the size of a house, wobbled towards them.

Although its appearance seemed amusing.

"But it's not an opponent to take lightly. Despite its appearance, the Parasitic Bug's tongue is as fast as lightning."

There was no way to avoid being grabbed by its long tongue and devoured.

They could only kill it.

"In the past, thousands sacrificed themselves like moths to barely capture it. But now?"

There was no need for people to sacrifice themselves.

As long as I step forward, it will be over.

"That frog creature, why is it so big?"

"Don't be scared! Let's all attack it togeth..."

"Everyone step back."

Blocking the larger players who were rushing to attack the Parasitic Bug, Ryu Min stepped forward.

"I'll take care of this creature."

There's 90% reflected damage, but it's not a problem.

Because I have an invincible cheat code.
