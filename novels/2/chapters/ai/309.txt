Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 309"

Survivors

When people first heard that the initial mission for Round 19 was survival, they worried.

How can we endure 72 hours without food and water?

If we don't reduce the number to less than 72, everyone will perish. What should we do?

Are we going to end up killing each other?

The concerns became a reality, and people indeed died.

However, when they realized it was due to the intervention of demons, people felt a moment of relief.

Humanity hasn't completely died out yet.

Well, that's right. Can't we avoid killing each other, no matter what?

There can't be that much trash among us.

Now, it seems that there won't be anyone else dying.

But when all the demons were eliminated and 48 hours had passed since the start of the round, people came to a realization.

That they had underestimated the cruelty of human nature.

"Die, you [expletive]!"

"Mother [expletive]!"

"All Asians must die!"

"[Expletive] little bastards!"

No matter how good the personalities of the people gathered were, a person can change in an instant.

Because humans are animals that change according to their environment.

Therefore, conflicts are bound to arise wherever they go.

Especially in a state where they are sensitive due to lack of sleep, food, and drink.

"Stop fighting! Please stop!"

"Who the hell are you!"

"Kill that [expletive] too!"

[The fortieth death has occurred.] [The forty-first death has occurred.] [The forty-second death has occurred.]

Trying to stop it only increased the number of casualties.

It was a complete mess.

As if determined to kill anyone who annoyed them, everyone was immersed in killing each other.

"Why are you all doing this, seriously! We didn't buff you just for this!"

Minjuri shouted, but no one listened.

Or rather, there were people, but they didn't respond.

They just sought revenge by pointing their swords at others.

"Don't interfere! Do you want to die too? Oh, you do? Then let me kill you..."

The man approaching Minjuri stopped in his tracks.

Four fairies, three golems, and two soul knights surrounded Minjuri.

"Anyone approaching from this side will be killed. Whether it's an empty threat or not, come and check for yourself."

"...Damn!"

Despite the non-threatening threat from Seoarin, the man turned around and once again got involved in the battlefield.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes. Thank you, Seoarin."

"Compared to what Minjuri did for me, this is nothing."

Understanding Seoarin's words, Minjuri smiled as if embarrassed.

She had tried to sacrifice herself in front of a demon with a lion's face to save someone else.

"Why did you do that back then?"

"What do you mean?"

"Why did you try to save my life?"

"Me? Seoarin?"

Minjuri was flustered by the direct question.

"Well, you seem to have some misunderstanding. I wasn't trying to save Seoarin. At that time, Yanti Unni was there too."

"That's true, but... Anyway, you tried to sacrifice yourself. How could you muster that courage?"

Minjuri's answer was simple.

"Since I was going to die anyway, wouldn't it be better if I could save someone else's life, even if it's just one person?"

It was a straightforward calculation that she would willingly sacrifice one to save two.

"Minjuri, you're amazing. Your decision-making reminds me of Black Scythe."

"Thank you for the compliment."

Minjuri and Seoarin smiled at each other.

But it was only for a moment.

[The fifty-third death has occurred.]

With the continuous messages of more deaths, they couldn't help but tense up again.

"Shouldn't we intervene?"

At Minjuri's question, Seoarin shook her head and calmly replied.

"No. Let it be."

"But..."

"You saw it a little while ago, didn't you? If we intervene recklessly, we might be the only ones harmed. There's no room for negotiation with words either."

About 30 people were entangled in petty quarrels, resorting to violence, and they had to just watch.

"It's better to watch. Look at the numbers fighting right now."

"Huh...?"

"How many will there be if those people all die?"

"It would be less than 72, right?"

Seoarin nodded her head.

"It might be better to let them fight. There's no way to stop it anyway."

Other colleagues seemed to share the same thought and chose to watch without intervening.

Joaoh, Russell, John Delgaudo, Joo Sungtak, Yanti, Eom Junseok, Dorothy, Alex, Victor, Sophia, and others.

All the colleagues they met in the Twin Gorge.

They were hoping for each other's mutual destruction.

Otherwise, they might find themselves in a situation where they had to kill each other.

Did their desperate wish come true?

[The seventieth death has occurred.] [The player with the nickname 'Ali' has died.] [Since 10 minutes have passed after death, the player will be annihilated.] [Current remaining players: 73] [Annihilated players: 70] [Time remaining until the end of the round: 23:17:49]

After a fierce battle, the death toll reached 70.

Now, if only one more person dies, the remaining players will be 72, fulfilling the survival condition.

And coincidentally, only one person survived the bloodbath.

"Heuk, heuk."

The lone man remaining, Reynald, looked around with lively eyes.

In the chaotic fight, everyone except him had died.

He couldn't remember how many he had killed, but that didn't matter anymore.

He was already exhausted beyond measure.

"Heuk, heuk."

However, Reynald couldn't put down the sword in his hand.

Because he felt the gazes from the other side watching him.

"Oh, don't come. Don't come! Do you want to die too?"

Perhaps due to his shaking vision, he felt as if a crowd was approaching.

Reynald, who was on guard with the sword in his hand, took a step back.

He knew it too.

That he had to die for all 72 to survive.

"Do you think I'll die so easily? Don't make me laugh! I'll survive cunningly like a villain."

Thinking that they were coming to kill him, Reynald, shaking, turned and fled.

Meanwhile, Seoarin's group just watched without saying a word.

"He yelled and ran away."

"I guess he thought we were going to harm him."

"Well, if only one person dies, everyone else survives, so he probably thought he'd be the target."
ChatGPT

Seoarin and Minjuri watched Reynald move away while exchanging conversation.

Although the situation guaranteed survival if he had died too, they didn't feel regret.

They had no intention to kill him.

They just stood there, numbly watching the tragedy unfold.

"Let's go."

"Where to? Over there?"

"We need to check if there are any survivors. It's unlikely, but..."

Following Seoarin, the group approached the area filled with corpses.

There were as many bodies as the death message numbers.

There were no survivors.

"Let's clean up to erase any traces. If we leave them like this, monsters might eat them."

"All right."

The agreed-upon group neatly disposed of the corpses.

The outcome wasn't favorable, but these were once comrades who trusted and relied on each other.

At least letting them be eaten by monsters was better than that.

"Now that it's done, let's go."

"Where to?"

"We can't rest here."

The weary group slowly walked away.

You can tell how much time has passed by checking the quest window.

However, people avoided looking at the quest window as much as possible.

The reason was simple.

Every time they looked at the remaining time, disappointment set in.

[Time remaining until the end of the round: 12:03:39]

"Ah, there's still 12 hours left?"

Minjuri, who looked at the time, made a disgusted face.

Hearing that, Seoarin and the others had the same expression.

It felt like it had been quite a while, but time seemed to pass so slowly.

"I'm hungry...."

"If only I could have a sip of water...."

Initially, it was difficult because they couldn't sleep, but now that was resolved.

They filled their need for rest by taking turns with the reliable party members in a location where monsters didn't appear.

There was no need to worry about stamina.

With healers present, staying still was not a difficult task.

But the real hardship was not that.

Hunger.

The biggest issue was not being able to eat anything.

Even Kristin's healing couldn't fill their hunger.

They couldn't even wash themselves properly.

So, everyone looked like beggars who hadn't eaten for days, with haggard faces.

"There's nothing to eat, and I'm starving. Feels like we've collectively entered a hunger strike center."

"Forced diet... I've never experienced this even during my trainee days..."
ChatGPT

"Do actors go on diets too?"

Seoarin tilted her head.

"Others might, but I didn't need to. I don't gain weight even if I eat."

"Ah... It's your metabolism. I envy that."

"I envy Minjuri even more..."

Seoarin's gaze turned towards Minjuri's chest, but Minjuri pretended not to notice, feeling embarrassed.

"Well, anyway, shouldn't we go meet other players, not just stick together?"

"No. How can we trust others?"

The current group consisted of 24 people, including mercenaries.

These were the elite members who could trust Black Scythe, gathered to the Twin Gorge.

The whereabouts of the remaining 49 were unknown.

Well, they could track them if they wanted to, but they chose not to.

Accepting them as allies might lead to unexpected consequences.

On the other hand, the others might not trust them either.

"I think it's better for us to endure while camping."

"Do you think so?"

The 24 members remained still, huddled in one place without wasting unnecessary energy.

There was no need to waste energy needlessly.

However, enduring like this was not as easy as it seemed.

They had to somehow fill the slow-passing time while facing hunger.

"It would have been nice if we had smartphones."

"I agree."

Without smartphones, talking was the only way for them to pass the time.

Was it because of that?

Seoarin and Minjuri, who had many conversations, became much closer than before.

It wasn't to the point of revealing everything yet.

That was when an unexpected notification appeared in front of them.

[The seventy-first death has occurred.] [The player with the nickname 'Reynald' has died.] [Since 10 minutes have passed after death, the player will be annihilated.] [Current remaining players: 72] [Annihilated players: 71] [Time remaining until the end of the round: 11:57:28] [The current number of players has become 72 or fewer.] [The penalty for complete annihilation disappears.] [We secure the right to survive the entire round.]

It was like a welcome rain after a long drought.
ChatGPT

"Isn't Reynald the person who survived during that battle?"

"Yes, that's him."

"Why do you think he died all of a sudden?"

"Maybe he died of starvation? Or perhaps he was killed by monsters."

That possibility was high, especially considering how much stamina he had depleted during the fight.

"Now that he won't be annihilated anymore, it's a relief."

"As long as we endure the remaining time, yes."

Just enduring was enough to survive.

This fact revived the players with a renewed determination, like a fading flame coming back to life.

Even though there was nothing to do but sit and endure.

During such conversations, Seoarin noticed someone approaching.

"Uh?"

"Someone is coming."

Upon her words, a group, showing their empty hands and clearly expressing no intention to fight, approached Seoarin's group.

"Don't be on guard. We didn't come here to fight."

"There's no reason to fight now, anyway."

Showing empty hands and expressing no intention to fight, the group approached Seoarin's team.

Seoarin remained cautious.

"So, what brings you here?"

"Are you, by any chance, out of food? We're starving to death."

Everyone felt disappointed at such a simple reason.

"Sorry, but we don't have any either."

"We've been without water or a single drop of food."

As soon as they realized they were in the same situation, the faces of the people became sullen.

"Can we join you?"

"Of course. There's nothing wrong with sticking together."

These players, who had fought fiercely as if to kill each other until they reached 72, had a different situation now.

There was no reason to kill each other, and there was no energy for such intentions.

As time passed, people began to gather, and eventually, excluding Black Scythe, all 71 survivors were able to gather in one place.

"Phew... There are still 3 hours left."

Seoarin, looking at the remaining time, sighed and looked at Minjuri.

It seemed like her eyes were searching for someone.

"Why? Are you looking for Black Scythe?"

"Oh, no."

Minjuri whispered quietly so that others couldn't hear.

"It was Min who was looking for him."

"Minyu?"
ChatGPT

"It should be visible, but why can't we see what happened?"

"...."

There were 71 people present in this place, excluding Black Scythe.

The number was small enough to be confirmed with the naked eye.

"Why isn't it visible?"

Seoarin sighed as she watched Minjuri rise suddenly and move around.

When Minjuri returned, Seoarin, with a face expressing her inability to continue watching, spoke.

"Minjuri. Do you really not know, or do you find it hard to believe?"

"What? What are you talking about?"

Seoarin, conscious of her surroundings, whispered as she spoke.

"Do you still not believe it? That Black Scythe is Ryu Min?"

"How can they be the same person?"

"They are the same person. I heard it directly from Ryu Min."

"I heard it from Min too. She tried to dismiss it as a bad joke."

"It's not a joke. Ryu Min has no reason to joke about it."

"...."

As Seoarin said this, Minjuri couldn't help but rethink the situation.

"Are they really the same person?"

"Yes."

"But their appearances are different. And their personalities..."

"Appearances can be altered. Didn't you also see Minjuri?"

"Ah."

Minjuri belatedly remembered.

The scene where Black Scythe, appearing as an angelic demon, transformed into Hwang Yongmin even after turning into a sheep.

And the scene where he transformed his appearance back into Black Scythe.

Even though he turned into a sheep, Minjuri was certainly an eyewitness to that scene.

"As for the personality..."

"Personality is also part of the concept. Ryu Min intentionally pretended to be someone else to wear the mask of Black Scythe."

"So it's really..."

As Minjuri struggled to believe, an exclamation came from someone.

"Hey, look over there! There's a demon!"

A demon appeared.

It wasn't a mistaken view; it was a real demon with red skin.

But people blinked their eyes as if their vision was wrong.

Because there was a familiar man next to the demon.

"That's... Black Scythe, isn't it?"

Black Scythe appeared alongside the demon.
