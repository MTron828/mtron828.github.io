Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 154"

Round 10 begins

[Breaking News! Leader of IS uploads suicide video on Al-Baghdadi YouTube...]
[IS Leader's suicide? Global shock at the shocking video.]
[The video claiming to be IS leader spreads like wildfire, but taken down in just 15 minutes...]

The sensational headlines caught Ryu Min's attention, but he already knew it was a fact without a shred of falsehood.

"Min, Min! Is this really true? That the IS leader is dead?"

"Well..."

"A suicide video? What's that about?"

"I'm curious too, but I can't find it anywhere."

The video that Al-Baghdadi was instructed to upload on YouTube was already deleted and gone. However, it had been exposed for 15 minutes, and with 10,000 clicks in that short time, denying the existence of the video was impossible.

"Oh? Look at this. There's a blog that summarizes the situation."

Minjuri's words were true; someone had captured the video and succinctly summarized the situation.

The post, 30 minutes old, already had over 100 comments.

└Is this real? IS leader committed suicide?

└How can we believe he's the IS leader in the first place? Isn't this just fake news?

└Did reporters collectively take drugs? Organizing fake news like this?

└I live in the U.S., and this is true. It was reported on CNM, and it's a big deal.

└Doesn't seem like fake news. You can easily search foreign articles on Goggle.

└So is it real? Did the IS leader commit suicide?

└Even looking at the video screenshots, I can't tell.

└Hey, after checking around, I got hold of the video. It's real. The guy who claimed to be the IS leader revealed evidence that he's the leader somewhere in Nigeria, and after saying something about all the members being killed by the Black Scythe, he had no face to show to Allah, so he cut his throat and committed suicide. Really shocking.

└Is it true?

└Where can I watch the video? Please send it to my email. aksqorghl@maver.com

└Me too. My email address is ehrwksla@maver.com

└I want it too. My email is chlrhek@maver.com!

└I sat down to write a novel. IS leader gone crazy and committed suicide? Damn.

└Seriously, lol. This blog seems to be saying it watched the video to increase views, and the guy above also pretends to believe it like a fanatic, but innocent people actually believe it.

└There are two idiots above. Only 10,000 people watched the video, and it's trending globally in real-time news. This is fake, damn.

└Lol, right. If people fall for this on such a scale, they deserve it.

└But is it true that the IS leader mentioned the Black Scythe before dying?

└According to the article, he killed all his subordinates and organization with the Black Scythe, got overwhelmed, and committed suicide.

└Lol, how many did he kill to get overwhelmed?

└Who is the Black Scythe? Am I the only one who doesn't know?

└The newly established CPF commander. Among players, he's known for being so powerful that he's called a monster.

└Isn't he a serial killer if he killed dozens to hundreds of people?

└Even if you eliminate a terrorist who kills people to achieve justice, in the Republic of Korea, they treat you as a murderer. Classic.

└They're just trash, and with the Big Player law, they probably won't be charged with murder.

└Since the crime was committed in Nigeria, they should follow their laws.

└They probably don't mind in Nigeria. They took care of the pests themselves lol.

└These guys are funny. There's no evidence that the Black Scythe did that, but they believe and sit down lol.

└Check if the Black Scythe left Nigeria on that day. If you meet him in the other world, ask him, Minjuri thought as she read the comments.

Whether this article claiming they defeated IS was true or not.

'It's true, then.'

Some didn't believe immediately, but as time passed, it would be completely revealed.

'Just by checking entry and exit records, and considering the evidence in Nigeria.'

Even among the people Ryu Min had contacted that day, there were over a hundred.

Even if just one or two of them proved it to the media, it would boost the Black Scythe's reputation.

'Interview requests will come in.'

He hadn't checked yet, but it was as clear as day that Lost Yak's phone would ring like crazy.

Sure enough.

While Minjuri was in the bathroom, Ryu Min sneakily checked her phone and found dozens of missed calls and messages.

As expected, they were interview requests from the media.

'Luckily, I had it on silent. Otherwise, I could have been caught by Minjuri.'

It was a smart move to make Al-Baghdadi film a suicide video instead of just killing him.

'Even the FBI and Interpol wouldn't be oblivious to Al-Baghdadi's face. Moreover, once they verify the evidence he left behind, it will easily confirm the 2nd Caliph of IS.'

Eventually, proper announcements and articles would be released by the U.S. and Nigerian governments, both of which had been chasing IS.

Soon, the fact that the Black Scythe had collapsed the IS organization would be known worldwide.

'Even if we confirm it in reality, it will be difficult to find the remnants of IS. I told Al-Baghdadi to gather all the remaining forces and kill them, so there should be no pests left.'

Of course, there might be some followers left, but Ryu Min had done his best for world peace.

In reality, it was more about building the reputation of the Black Scythe than achieving peace.

"Black Scythe is truly amazing... When did he go abroad and cause such a thing?"

"Yeah."

"Min, didn't you know? You can see the future."

"I didn't. The future isn't something I can see as I please."

"Oh."

Minjuri only asked that much and didn't pursue it further.

Indeed, being a prophet was a convenient excuse.

While the world was buzzing with the eradication of IS, time passed.

Midnight on October 1st.

Approximately 2,700 players gathered in one place.

They were the last remaining players in South Korea.

'After today, only 25% of them will survive.'

It was a desperate situation, but even Ryu Min couldn't change the laws of the system.

'If I can't save everyone, I should at least save those who can be of help to me.'

People who could be of help to Ryu Min approached him.

Minjuri, Ma Kyung-rok, Ahn Sang-chul, Seo Arin, Heo Tae-seok, Cho Yong-ho, and Yumtii.

"Black Scythe, um...?"

As they, who had come to find the Black Scythe, noticed each other, they exchanged cautious glances.

Why are there so many people?

Did everyone come to talk to the Black Scythe?
ChatGPT
Why did you attach yourselves to Black Scythe? Did you come to gain some benefits?

Though they harbored negative feelings towards each other, no one showed it.

In front of the absolute being called Black Scythe, they couldn't afford to present a pathetic appearance.

"Hello, Black Scythe."

"Hello."

"Hi..."

Though they exchanged greetings, Ryu Min didn't respond to any of them.

All of them were Ryu Min's forces that he couldn't discard.

Therefore, he asked them all.

"Why did everyone come to me?"

"Oh. Who should speak first?"

"Well, I heard that you eradicated IS."

Minjuri brought up the question first.

"Is it true?"

"It is."

Without beating around the bush, he cleanly admitted it, and everyone looked at him with surprised eyes.

"Really, you've eliminated IS..."

"Indeed, Black Scythe... the commander of CPF."

"Thank you for putting effort into global purification, even going to another country!"

Heo Tae-seok, who used to be shy, suddenly spoke exaggeratedly.

Reading his thoughts, it seemed like he deliberately wanted to attract attention.

Seems like he has something to say.

"Nopain Nogain. Do you have something to say to me?"

"Oh, yes, Black Scythe. You've understood my intentions."

"Answer the question when asked."

"Well, the thing is, I've created a religion this time."

"A religion?"

"Which deity does your religion worship..."

Heo Tae-seok slowly extended his arms and, as if receiving someone, energetically reached out.

None other than towards Ryu Min.

"It's a religion that venerates Black Scythe as a deity!"

"I'm not a deity."

"That's subjective. In our Sashin Religion, Black Scythe is indeed a deity!"

"Sashin Religion?"

Though the name was somewhat cringe-worthy, Heo Tae-seok looked quite proud, setting aside his shame.

"Yes! Isn't it cool? Sashin Religion! We've already gathered six followers. Of course, I'm the head priest. Here's Eom Jun-seok, our deputy."

"Hmm..."

Next to Heo Tae-seok, there was Eom Jun-seok.

Embarrassed by the title of deputy, he couldn't lift his face.

"If anyone is interested, please join our Sashin Religion. Anyone who loves Black Scythe is welcome with open arms!"

Ryu Min was about to say a word inappropriately promoting, as some players seemed interested.

'Minjuri, Seo Arin, Yumtii... even Cho Yong-ho?'

Though no one explicitly showed it, there was an air of wanting to join the Sashin Religion.

At that moment,

"Oh! There you are!"

Another group, looking for Black Scythe, appeared.

"Commander!"

They were CPF members Ryu Min had seen in reality.

Of course, with customized faces, it was hard to recognize them, but since they knew each other's nicknames, identification wasn't difficult.

"You guys."

"Commander, it's disappointing! Going to Nigeria alone!"

"If you were going to catch the IS pests, you should have taken us with you!"

Though spoken in a playful tone, Ryu Min took it seriously.

"You should protect Korea. Where else were you planning to go?"

"Please share the credit of defeating IS with us too."

"Hey, aren't they formidable opponents? There are only a few suspected players of IS."

"Yeah, you'll only be a hindrance if you go. Unless it's me."

"Nonsense. A guy with less skill than me."

"Hey, still, I have more crime suspect captures than you?"

"That's a different matter."

"Stop it, everyone. None of us has the skill to deal with hundreds of IS. It's impossible without the Commander."

"That's true."

Listening to the conversation of the members who nodded in acknowledgment, Ryu Min secretly sighed.

'How did it become so cheesy?'

Just a while ago, Ryu Min used to survive and act alone for his own benefit.

But now, people had gathered around him.

'I won't face the risk of extinction due to a lack of members like before.'

Of course, assuming that he could overcome hardships and lead people well until Round 20.

At that moment, there was a flash of light in the sky, and a being with wings spread out spoke.

"Hello, humans? I'm the angel Nele, in charge of Round 10 guidance. I'll be explaining this round, so please pay attention, unless you want your heads to explode."

The eerie words were followed by a cheerful smile from the angel as they addressed everyone.

[Congratulations on reaching Round 10. Already, half of you have made it, and it's truly moving. Remarkable individuals! However, today is not the day for arrogance. It's a challenging round where only a quarter will survive.]

"What? A quarter?"

"Huh..."

Seeing the players becoming anxious, Nele smirked.

[Getting nervous, huh? Shall we take a look at the information for the next round?]
