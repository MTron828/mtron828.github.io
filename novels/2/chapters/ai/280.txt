Title: Episode 280 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Combination of God-tier Materials

[Used the Infinite Ingredient Pouch.] [Congratulations! Five material items have been obtained!] [Items will be added to the inventory!]

Using the material pouch received as a reward in the 17th round, five materials are obtained.

'Bubbling desires, undeniable moonlight, wings extinguished in darkness....'

Most of the materials were unknown to others.

Except for one.

'Oh, condensed ether came out?'

It's an item that's not easy to get through gacha, but it came out.

Thanks to a luck stat exceeding one million.

'By the way, were there so many materials I didn't know about?'

Ryumin clicked his tongue while looking at the materials.

He knew that gacha was influenced by luck stats, but he didn't expect to get all unknown materials.

'Well, it's the first time my stats have exceeded one million this time.'

In the 99th round, Ryumin's base stats were in the thousands.

Even with buffs, it barely exceeded ten thousand.

'But now the base is in the tens of thousands. With buffs, it becomes hundreds of thousands.'

In other words, he has become over 100 times stronger than the previous round.

Since he hasn't tried gacha in this state, it's not strange that unknown materials come out.

'All of this is thanks to the stats given by the Archangel.'

Ryumin became stronger because of the reward for killing the Archangel.

If he had known, he would have killed the Archangels sooner.

Since it was his first time killing an Archangel, there were many new aspects.

Even the Eternal tier was like that.

'Now that condensed ether is available, why not try combining it?'

Just as he did in the other world, Ryumin placed various materials on the combination window and pressed the combine button.

Since he doesn't know the combination method of Eternal, he has no choice but to discover it through this trial and error method.

[This combination formula is not possible.] [This combination formula is not possible.] [This combination formula is not possible.]

............

..........

Although the message saying it's not possible keeps coming out, he doesn't give up.

'If I put refined ether and condensed ether as sub-materials, there might be a possibility.'

After trying several combinations, he felt something.
ChatGPT

[Main Material]

Dragon Horn

[Sub Materials]

Refined Ether

Condensed Ether

Essence of Negativity

Bubbling Desire

Penetrating Gaze

It was not something to dismiss with simple intuition.

The moment the button was pressed, completely different results emerged.

[Combining Eternal Grade Item.] [It takes time to create a high-grade item. Please wait patiently.] [Combining materials...] [Analyzing user's soul...] [Sync tuning...] [Combination successful!] [Created 'Eye of Insight.']

"There we go. It's combined!"

A smile of satisfaction appeared on Ryumin's face.

[Eye of Insight]

Type: Helmet

Grade: Eternal

Defense: 5,000

Effect: All stats +200, pierces through the essence of the opponent and identifies weaknesses.

Durability: Infinite

Usage Restriction: Black Scythe (Soul-bound)

Description: A soul-bound item that exerts influence not on the user's physical body but on the soul. It cannot be transferred to others. It can be applied in conjunction with other equipment items.

When it comes to items, the most important thing is undoubtedly the options.

"But this... it's more amazing than I thought?"

Piercing through the essence of the opponent?

Well, that doesn't matter much.

The crucial part is being able to identify weaknesses.

Of course, if you just crush everything with strength, it should be enough...

"There might be situations that can't be resolved with strength alone."

In those situations, this option would be useful.

Especially in times like now, challenging the minds of the gods.

Maybe he'll end up fighting the gods.

"The best thing is to prevent such situations from happening."

Satisfied after trying on the item, Ryumin stopped combining at this point.

There was one more condensed ether to use as a sub-material, but there was no refined ether, which is essential.

"Without refined ether, making an Eternal is impossible."

He has a suspicion about where to find it.

"Probably need to kill Michael."

Although he released him from Heaven, there's no need to worry.

When it reaches the 18th round, he will appear on his own.
ChatGPT

Whether for a good purpose or a bad one.

"I might have to kill him then."

Refined ether, and even for the soul-binding quest, he had to kill him.

A destiny already set.

"But I'll use him as much as I need before killing him."

The same goes for demons.

There are things to ask the demon side that will appear in the 18th round.

That's also why he chose the faction change ticket.

"I need to prepare for the upcoming 18th round."

Ryumin immediately picked up his phone.

There is a need to strengthen his power.

"Hey, Lord Heo. Summon all the believers of the Sasin faith right away. Every one of them."

Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

Buzzing-

The Sasin faith building was packed with unexpected people.

"284, 285, 286...."

Although he counted when entering, Heo Taeseok counted the number of heads again just in case.

Including himself and the Black Scythe, 286 people in total.

Everyone entered the worship hall.

"Are we all here? That's a relief. It would be unfair if I went to the bathroom and didn't get the benefits alone. Haha."

"As expected, everyone's here. It would be......"

As Heo Taeseok finished speaking, Eom Junseok's interpreter immediately continued.

Since half of them were Koreans, it was a natural choice since there were also quite a few foreigners.

"You were all surprised by the sudden summons, right? It's nothing else; Black Scythe has prepared special benefits for you all. Wondering what kind of benefits they are? You'll be really surprised when you hear it. From now on, what the Black Scythe says will be as valuable as information about the next round."

Expectation filled the eyes of the people.

They were curious about what kind of information the Black Scythe would give.

People's gazes concentrated on Heo Taeseok as if urging him to speak quickly.

"That is... the Black Scythe will personally tell you!"

"Ah...."

Disappointment lasted only for a moment.

Ryumin, standing on the podium, took the microphone and spoke in a calm tone.

"I'm going to share the combination method for God-tier items with all of you."

"God-tier?"

People's eyes widened.

After hearing from angels, everyone now knew how valuable God-tier was.
ChatGPT

The condensed ether received as a round reward is also a God-tier material.

"There won't be anyone without condensed ether in their possession. However, the majority of people don't know what to combine and how to create a God-tier item. But don't worry. I know all the combination formulas."

No one questioned how he knew.

Just as you wouldn't ask a blacksmith where they learned their forging skills.

They simply hoped that the Black Scythe, who knew the combination methods, would create their items.

In fact, that was Ryumin's intention when he brought up the topic.

"I'll create God-tier items for everyone right here, so please take out the materials you have and submit them. Let's check if you have the materials needed to make the items."

People willingly took out the materials they had in their possession and brought them forward.

Materials that would be useless without knowing the combination methods anyway.

Even if they were to be used for someone else, there was no reluctance.

Various materials, ranging from completely useless to those required for God-tier items, were stacked neatly on the podium.

After the submission was complete, Ryumin, who was categorizing the materials, subtly raised his head.

"It seems we might be short on making 285 God-tier items."

A lament of disappointment flowed with the realization that it might be insufficient.

Someone couldn't make a God-tier item, implying disappointment.

But Ryumin smiled as if to say there was no need to worry.

"Even if it's insufficient, there's no need to worry. Fortunately, you can buy materials with points at the special store."

Ryumin bought materials from the special store.

He only spent 1 million points.

He still had a considerable amount left, about 16 million points.

Even so, people looked at him with eyes full of admiration, as if seeing a philanthropist of the century.

Behind the mask, Ryumin let out a laugh, and when all preparations were done, he lined up the people.

"Please line up here in a row and come forward."

In the blink of an eye, a long line formed, as if anticipating the moment when they would face the Black Scythe one-on-one.

"The ones with condensed ether, raise your hands."

"Yes!"
ChatGPT

"Combine these materials with the sub-material and make the combination. You can use any Master-grade glove as the main material."

"Gloves, you say?"

"Yes. Since the materials vary for each part, don't be disappointed if it's not the part you desire."

As if instructing those behind to listen, people nodded.

Although it might not be the desired part, they decided to be satisfied with the opportunity to create a God-tier item.

"Oh, a God-tier glove has been created! The stats are truly incredible!"

"Since the person behind is waiting, go over there and make the combination. Next."

Ryumin distributed the combination materials one by one.

Despite the spoken reservations, he tried his best to match the desired parts with the thoughts of the recipients.

As a result, most people had expressions of satisfaction with their items.

"Min Juju, you'll be combining a helmet. Take it."

"Jo Yong-ho, this is material for a God-tier armor."

"Seo Arin, make shoes with this."

"Thank you, Lord Black Scythe."

Expressing gratitude from the people, he distributed the combination materials.

Although cheers erupted from various places, it remained bustling, and there was no one who crafted weapons.

To combine a God-tier weapon, you needed at least two condensed ethers.

After distributing to all 285 people, the materials were depleted exactly.

"I guess this will help us survive somewhat in the upcoming war."

It was a more demanding task than he thought, but there was still something to give.

"While everyone is probably pleased with the God-tier items, let's put them aside for a moment and listen to what I have to say."

Ryumin, capturing the attention of the people, began speaking.

In a way, it was the most crucial information.

"I will now inform you about Round 18."

Upon hearing this, people swallowed nervously and focused.

"The quest for Round 18 is a group mission: [Victory in the War]. In the war waged between angels and demons, our players must fight against the demons while standing on the side of the angels. In a way, from the perspective of the angels, we players are hired as mercenaries."

"Fighting... alongside angels...?"

"We have to fight against...?"

The eyes of the people widened and, for a moment, were covered in anger.

It wasn't that the angels were enemies; it was just that angels were practically no different from enemies to the players.

In fact, the demons, who had no previous interaction, felt more like allies.
ChatGPT

"To eat and fight alongside angels!"

"This is outrageous!"

Despite the protests, Ryumin's voice behind the mask remained calm.

Regardless of whether it makes sense or not, that's how the quest is set up. Whether you like it or not, you have to form a party with angels and fight."

"But that doesn't mean we have to tolerate the angels doing whatever they please!"

"If you can't tolerate it, what then? Do you want to lose the war and face destruction together?"

Silence fell in the crowd in response to Ryumin's ruthless words.

"If I hadn't heard about this in advance, you would have shown a pitiful sight in front of the angels."

"Um, do I really have to side with the angels?"

"Yes. Whether you like it or not, there's no choice. Face reality. To survive, you have to follow the quest."

"Are there no other ways, like not killing angels or something?"

"There's no other way. As I mentioned, it's a party, so team killing is impossible."

"Ah..."

It was a mission where they had to eat with adversaries and be on the same side. It was almost like being told to form a temporary alliance with North Korea and attack the United States.

But Ryumin's words were not over yet.

"There's not necessarily no way."
