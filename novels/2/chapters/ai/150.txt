Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 150"

This is my answer.

"How did you recognize my face?" Albagdadi wondered.

They hadn't even met, let alone exchanged information about each other, so how could someone know what his face looked like?

'Abubakar made sure that no one, not even him, could take a picture of me.'

He waited anxiously, intensely curious, but the response he received was absurd.

"Just because."

"What?"

"Just because I can."

If it were his younger self, Albagdadi might have started a fight, but he had patience now.

"Are you trying to provoke me? It's a futile attempt. I don't have that level of skill..."

"Enough of that, just say what you want. I'll give you a chance to speak."

Though impudent, Albagdadi restrained himself.

He was the leader of IS, not someone easily swayed by the opponent's provocation.

"Kang Dan is impressive. To be so arrogant in front of so many people."

"Is that all you have to say?"

"In truth, I responded to your call because I have one proposal."

"Let's hear it."

Albagdadi spoke directly without paying attention to the surrounding players.

"Join me. Dedicate yourself to IS and serve Allah. Then, you won't have to worry about the next round. You won't need to be anxious. Allah, the only god, will show you the way."

"..."

Unlike Ryu Min, who showed no reaction, Victor, hiding in the building and eavesdropping on the conversation, had to close his surprised mouth.

"Wha-what did I just hear? Did he just ask me to join IS?"

In a nutshell, Albagdadi was making a recruitment offer to the Black Scythe.

"How about it? Enjoying eternal life by dedicating yourself to Allah."

"It's not to Allah but to you that I would dedicate myself. And a tiger can't enter the den of a cat, right?"

"A tiger... Do you really think you're worthy of being considered at that level?"

"Well, maybe not. But one thing is certain. The so-called leader of IS is nothing more than a rat, not even worth comparing to a cat. Anyone would think that, seeing how he uses proxies while taking care of his own skin."
ChatGPT

"Ha. It seems your mouth matches your skill."

Albagdadi furrowed his brow, unable to tolerate it any longer.

"Do you really have no intention of joining me?"

"How many times do I have to say it? Can't you understand through words? Should I demonstrate through actions?"

Ryu Min's scythe flashed instantly, severing Abu Bakr's neck.

Tock-

The leader of Boko Haram found himself on the path to the afterlife in an instant.

"This is my answer. You rat."

"I never had any intention of using you as a hostage in the first place."

As if there was no longer any value in continuing the conversation, Albagdadi turned away.

"Let's see if your skills match up to your big mouth."

As he entered the crowd, players surrounded him, stepping forward.

"Kill him. Leave no trace of flesh."

As soon as the command was given, hundreds rushed towards Ryu Min.

Smirking behind his mask, Ryu Min looked at the members holding weapons.

'As expected, they only brought players?'

If they were ordinary members, he would have killed them mercilessly. However, knowing they were players, he decided to take it easy.

'They're just like items; it would be a waste to kill them so easily.'

The players were fortunate.

Ryu Min had made up his mind to take it easy.

Victor, who had been observing the situation from hiding in the building, clenched and unclenched his fists.

His palms were now wet with sweat.

'Is it finally starting? I'm getting nervous.'

The skill of the Black Scythe was reliable, but there could always be unforeseen circumstances.

A variable might come into play.

'Huh?'

But there was one strange thing.

None of the members gathered there were holding guns.

All of them were dressed in outdated attire and used melee weapons.

A realization struck Victor belatedly.

'W-wait, could they all be players?'

Not entirely sure, but the number seemed to be around 500.

'Were there this many players dedicated to IS?'

His skin tingled with a slight chill.

If it were him, he could handle one or two at most, but dealing with over 500, especially since they were players, was daunting.

'Is the Black Scythe okay? Isn't he a player, not an ordinary person?'
ChatGPT

Some sort of clanging sound echoedâ€” the clash of melee weapons, but it wasn't visible due to the angles.

Whether they were fighting properly or not.

Victor turned his head towards the Asian woman who seemed to be a comrade of the Black Scythe.

"What's your name? What is your name?"

The Asian woman, understanding some simple English, replied, "Me? Yamti. My name is Yamti."

"Yamti? Okay. Yamti. Do you think the Black Scythe can win? What do you think?"

"What are you saying? Ugh..."

As the conversation quickly ended, Yamti sighed.

"Listen carefully, Alchemist. I don't know if you understand, but I'll say what I can. Judging by your expression, you seem uneasy, but trust the Black Scythe. There's nothing we can do to help. All we can do is wait quietly for the leader of IS here."

"What? IS? You're saying IS might lose?"

When Victor, who understood the term IS, asked, Yamti hesitated and explained, "The Black Scythe told us to wait here, saying he would deliver the IS leader to us. So, don't worry. As long as we capture the IS leader, there won't be a problem."

Despite being told not to worry, Victor's expression seemed even darker than before for some reason.

Clang, clang, clang!

Ka-kang, kang, kang!

Various skills poured towards a single target.

No matter how high the level, avoiding skills raining from all directions seemed impossible.

That's what he thought until he saw it with his own eyes.

"He's still holding on?"

Albagdadi checked the time with surprised eyes.

Five minutes had passed.

Normally, he should have died.

But instead of a corpse, he was still fiercely fighting.

"Was it just a saying that he's not the number one in the rankings?"

Albagdadi brought a force of 500 out of the 800 players.

And all of them were players.

"Players should fight players."

Thinking that it might be better for players on death row to die rather than regular soldiers, and also thinking that he had enough power to kill them.

That's what he thought at the time.

But now his thoughts had changed.

"Is bringing this many forces still not enough?"

Most of them were at level 40, and he was aware of the significant level difference.
ChatGPT

However, he didn't expect that hundreds of people wouldn't be able to take down just one person.

'Even tried to kill him if I couldn't capture him. And even that wasn't easy.'

It seemed dangerous, keeping him alive.

He must tear and kill every player here, even if he had to burn them all.

'What's fortunate is that he seems to be struggling quite a bit too.'

The opponent was only defending with the scythe and not retaliating at all.

It seemed like he was in a hurry to block and evade.

'As time passes, the situation should tilt. Since he's human, his stamina can't be infinite.'

However, as the battle extended, there was no sign of improvement.

It was astonishing that no deaths were occurring.

Of course, it was fixed that the number of people the opponent had to face was 500.

'But even so, it's impressive. Blocking and evading cleanly even when attacked by dozens simultaneously.'

With that skill, he could probably dodge bullets.

A player who could dodge bullets?

It couldn't go unnoticed.

'If he claimed loyalty to Allah, he should have given up Abu Bakr's position immediately... What a pity.'

Perhaps he was a talent capable of a White House terror attack, but it was regrettable that he had to be killed here.

'What should I do now? I have to kill him, but his skill is not to be underestimated.'

As Albagdadi continued to watch the still-fighting Black Scythe, he suddenly felt a chill all over his body.

It was because their eyes met during the middle of the fight.

'He has the luxury to look at me?'

In the moment of surprise.

Thud, thud, thud!

The sound of tearing flesh and melee weapons striking was heard.

It wasn't that the Black Scythe was killed by someone else, but he was pierced and killed by other players.

"They killed the Black Scythe!"

The victorious players cheered.

Albagdadi's eyes seemed to bulge out.

The one who had been defending well all along died in a moment of carelessness?

'Did he become like that just because he looked at me?'

The surprise was soon followed by a smile.

Fortunately, the troublesome opponent who might pose a threat in the future had been killed.

"Hehe, the number one in the rankings wasn't that special. He died foolishly while being distracted."

At that moment, mocking laughter filled the air.

"Ugh!"
ChatGPT

Someone grabbed him from behind.

Albagdadi, pulled by a strong force, floated into the air.

Crash!

Breaking through a window of a building, he entered while holding his waist and making a groaning sound.

"Oh..."

It felt as if someone had caught him and tossed him into the building.

"Uh, what the..."

At that moment,

Swoosh-

Albagdadi's expression froze momentarily as he saw a presence appearing in mid-air.

It was none other than the Black Scythe, whom he thought was dead like a ragdoll.

"Black Scythe!"

Laughing slyly, Ryu Min pointed at Albagdadi.

"Dominate him."

Players laughed as they saw the Black Scythe, covered in blood from dozens of stabs.

"We killed him! Finally, we killed the heretic."

"We, we killed the Black Scythe!"

Having pledged allegiance to IS long before the world reached this point, they were reborn as even stronger warriors, now known as players.

They became the warriors of God, representing Allah, eliminating other heretics.

And they had killed the Black Scythe, who could be considered the greatest enemy of IS.

A smile blossomed on the faces of the members.

But it was only for a moment.

"Huh?"

In an instant, the corpse of the Black Scythe disappeared like an illusion.

They, who didn't even realize it might be a clone, looked bewilderedly for the body.

"What happened?"

"Did someone accidentally use an eraser to wipe out the traces?"

"If you used it, admit it honestly!"

They were relentless in searching for the body.

Not to mention finding the corpse, even finding Albagdadi's whereabouts seemed like an impossible task.

Since they were all captivated by the Black Scythe, they didn't witness Albagdadi flying away.

At that moment, Albagdadi appeared somewhere.

"What's all the commotion?"

"Oh, Leader."

As the leader of IS walked towards them, the players lowered their weapons and made way like a flowing river.

"Why are you making such a fuss?"

"We defeated the Black Scythe a while ago, but somehow the corpse disappeared."

"So what? What's the big deal?"

"What?"
ChatGPT

"The disappearance of the corpse is not important. What's crucial is that we killed the Black Scythe."

Albagdadi declared victory with a wide smile.

"You have defeated our organization's greatest obstacle. It is you, the proud warriors of Allah!"

"Woah!"

"Allah be praised! Today, we have cleared another obstacle! Thank you for always protecting us!"

"With this, we are one step closer to paradise!"

Albagdadi, smiling as if encouraging their joy, raised his hand to silence the audience.

"Now that the Black Scythe is gone, only the execution of justice remains. Before that, we need to redistribute the items, so everyone, drop the equipment you're wearing and all the items in your inventory on the ground. Everything without exception!"

"Yes!"

The leader of IS's command was absolute.

If he said to die, they died. If he said to live, they lived. If he said to surrender, they surrendered.

It was a reasonable request to collect and redistribute items in preparation for the upcoming terror attack.

So the players dropped everything.

From the equipment they were wearing to the items in their inventory, all were laid on the ground.

Soon, the open space turned into a sea of items, with more than 3,000 items appearing just by players dropping the gear they were wearing.

"Those who have dropped their items, move to the side!"

After becoming penniless, Albagdadi moved the organization members to a nearby open space.

It was a precautionary measure to prevent them from reclaiming the items.

Because...

"Well done. Now you must die."

"Yes?"

They had to die by the hands of the Black Scythe.

While Albagdadi was laughing, a sound was heard from somewhere.

Keeeing-

It was a clear and crisp sound.

Simultaneously, a bright light consecutively covered the players.
