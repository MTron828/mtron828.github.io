Title: Episode 241 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player

Goddess of Revenge

The revealed existence was Nemesis, known as the goddess of revenge.

Archangels, including Michael, politely expressed their greetings.

"[Goddess of Lamnus, Nemesis, we greet you.]"

Since it was the appearance of a divine being, it was only natural to show courtesy.

However, Nemesis' expression was not favorable.

"[Seven archangels reduced to three. Is this the state of affairs over just one human? Are those self-proclaimed rulers of the heavens not embarrassed?] [Uh, we apologize.] [Embarrassment or not, lift your heads. You'll soon realize how thick-skinned you are.] […….]

Though the archangels raised their heads, they couldn't meet her gaze.

[Tsk tsk, judging by your expressions, it seems some of you still have a conscience.]

Nemesis' icy gaze then turned to Michael.

"Michael. You came to me to find a human harboring a revengeful spirit towards the Black Scythe, right?"

"Yes."

"Do you remember what I said at that time?"

"Of course. You said that as long as he uses the Devil Duke's belonging, we must fulfill his revenge. Plutonictos will be satisfied by witnessing the offering's worth…."

"Exactly. But what happened now?"

"...Unfortunately, we failed."

"Do you know what happened because of that failure?"

Michael, who had been avoiding eye contact while expressing remorse, finally met her eyes.

"What happened?"

"Plutonictos ordered to bring the Black Scythe, the scythe that killed his avatar, before the 18th round. If not, be prepared for war."

"Ah...."

The archangels opened their mouths as if they had made a promise.

What started as an attempt to capture the Black Scythe had unexpectedly grown into something much larger.

"Now, they're asking us to take responsibility for using the Devil's resurrection book at our discretion. Of course, it's an external excuse, and the reality is an intention to create a pretext for war."

The archangels maintained their silence.

Especially Gabriel, who had nothing to say even if he had ten mouths.

After all, his own plan had caused the outbreak of war.

This incident might trigger the 7th Heaven and Demon Great War. Even though it was supposed to be a future war during the ceasefire, the timing has been expedited because we handed over that damn pretext.

Nemesis' forehead became even more furrowed.

From her entrance until now, the goddess's forehead had not relaxed.

"A war in a situation where even the archangels are scarce, all because of that Black Scythe... If a conflict arises now, the defeat of the angels is evident. Plutonictos is aware of this and is seizing this opportunity."

"Um, is there any way to refuse?"

"How can you refuse when the enemy insists on war? ...Well."

"Well, by using the resurrection book to offer the soul of the Black Scythe, Plutonictos would have been satisfied. But didn't you fail? Without gaining anything from him, you lost only the avatar. So, what are you going to say?"

"Then, if we hand over only the Black Scythe as requested, will the war not happen?"

"That's right. With all the gods watching, do you think he can break a promise just because it's him?"

"...At least there's a way to make amends, fortunately."

Though he said that, Michael couldn't help but feel a burning in his chest.

He might have to shatter his wish to become a god with his own hands.

"The promised deadline is before the 18th round. Until then, do whatever it takes to subdue the Black Scythe and throw it to Plutonictos. You must hand over the sinner who killed the archangels. It's not pleasant, but what can you do? You have no choice but to comply if you want to delay the war."

Nemesis, speaking like a sigh, looked at Gabriel, who was bowing his head like a sinner.

"I've heard the story. Is this all part of the plan you came up with?"

"...Yes."

"How did Gabriel, who led the gods to victory in the last war, end up like this?"

"I'm sorry... It's all my fault."

"I understand. That's why you have even more responsibility to bear. You must know that the expectations the gods have for you in the next war are significant, right? So, take this opportunity to prove your worth and live up to the title of the Oracle of the Gods."

"I will definitely bring results that meet expectations."

"Don't disappoint me twice. If you want to continue receiving my support."

Having said that, Nemesis exchanged glances with Michael and Raphael before tearing the space and disappearing.

Translation:

The last words were not only directed at Gabriel.

It was a warning sent to all three angels.

"Sigh... This is a big problem. I didn't expect Plutonictos to use the resurrection book as an excuse to advance the war."

According to Nemesis, if they go to war now, defeat is certain.

"At least it would take until Round 20 for any chance of victory. If they don't bring it by Round 18, is war inevitable?"

There is a way to delay the war.

Handing over the Black Scythe.

But isn't that easier said than done?

And what about their own desires?

"Is the goal of becoming a god something to be postponed again?"

While Michael sighed inwardly, there was a spark in Gabriel's eyes.

Because of the mission to subdue the Black Scythe at any cost.

"Lord Michael, please send me in Round 15."

"...."

"I will definitely neutralize the Black Scythe and bring it to Heaven."

"Gabriel, why do you want to go alone? I will go too."

"Raphael, it's not your place to intervene. This is something I will handle alone."

"No, it's not. Didn't you hear what Nemesis said? This concerns everyone."

Since it was mentioned as involving everyone, even Michael couldn't back down.

"Well, there's still time until Round 18, so there's no need to rush."

"But, Lord Michael."

"Listen to me this time. I don't want to mess things up again."

Gabriel, who twitched his eyebrows, closed his mouth.

He, who was no different from a sinner, had no right to speak.

"We must approach this cautiously. Do you not know what happened when the other archangels underestimated the Black Scythe? This time, it could happen to you too."

"If the three of us go together, we can surely subdue it, right?"

"That's true. But arrogance is poison. Haven't we repeatedly failed as a result? Instead of following the conventional method, we might need to consider alternative approaches."

"Do you have any alternative methods in mind?"

"We'll have to think about it from now on."

The archangels fell silent.

Unaware that Michael's seemingly trivial strategy was an attempt to buy time.

Rumin, resting at home, received a message from John.

Translation:

In a positive light, it was a farewell; in a negative light, it was a scolding.

"Master, preparations are underway in the Despair Sect to strike against the Reaper Sect."

"For what reason?"

"They claim that the Reaper Sect is interfering, as they need to recruit new believers. They say the Reaper Sect took away their prospective disciples..."

"Well, they're not entirely wrong. But what gives them the confidence to challenge me?"

"The plan is to kidnap Christine and use it as leverage. It seems Christine is considered a weakness of the Black Scythe."

"Well, she does have a weakness."

Christine is the key to Round 15.

Using her wide-range healing, she can save many people in Round 15.

"Not that the strategy can't be executed without Christine, but without her, there would be more sacrifices."

In the previous round, over 2,000 challengers participated, but only 50 survived.

Because Christine died early.

"To save as many people as possible, we need to protect Christine."

Lost in thought for a while, John cautiously asks during the call.

"What should we do? I said I would review the situation, but..."

"Continue to stall for time. Absolutely do not proceed."

"Understood."

"And there might be variables, so I will go there myself."

"You're coming to the United States?"

"Yes. Also to meet Christine."

"Oh, I see. Let me know when you arrive. I'll go to the airport to pick you up."

"No need for that. I'll meet Christine first. Act as usual without unnecessary suspicions. If there are any necessary instructions, I'll contact you again."

"Understood. Master."

After ending the call, Ryumin switched his phone.

Rather than calling as the Black Scythe, he would call Christine as the prophet.

"Ah, Christine? It's Ryumin."

"Prophet! It's been a while. I was actually thinking about contacting you."

"For me?"

"Yes. There have been many changes in my situation in various ways. Even the strategy for the next round and getting to know the Black Scythe, all thanks to you... In that sense, I thought about going to Korea to say hello."

"No need for that. I'll be coming to your place."

-Yes? You're coming to Dallas?

"I have something to discuss with you. It's about the prophecy for Round 15. Can you make time for it?"

-Of course. I have plenty of time.

"Then, let's meet in two days. I'll contact you again."

-Sure. When you come, let's have a meal. I'll treat you.

"Haha, sounds good."

With a smile, Ryumin ended the call and reserved a ticket while tapping his phone.

After booking the earliest flight, he went out to the living room.

"I should also inform Won."

His younger brother was leisurely watching TV in the living room.

On the screen, there was news about the Black Scythe.

"Hyung, isn't the Black Scythe really amazing?"

"In what way?"

"He deals with the bad guys alone and saved countless people. In the last Round 14, he killed the final boss with one blow to prevent any casualties. People were praising him. Did that really happen?"

"How did you know that?"

"I got some information from the forums. Everyone, including regular people and players, is going crazy because of the Black Scythe."

"Is that so?"

Although there was a commotion, Ryumin didn't feel it much.

He rarely used the internet, and there was no one recognizing him like a celebrity.

"It's expected since I kept my identity hidden."

Smirking, Ryumin continued to watch TV. His brother looked at Ryumin and spoke.

"Hyung, by the way, why are you just standing there? Do you have something to say to me?"

"Yeah."

"Are you going to say you're going on a trip?"

"How did you know?"

"Lately, you've been going overseas quite often. Maybe it's because of the Japanese girlfriend."

Although he didn't have a girlfriend, it was easier to let his brother misunderstand than to come up with various excuses.

"Anyway, I'll be going on an overnight trip again this time. I'll be back within a week."

"Got it. Come back safely. Don't worry about me. The world has gotten better thanks to the Black Scythe."

Does he know?

The fact that the Black Scythe he talks about is right in front of him.

"Yeah. I'll come back in peace. Don't just order jjajangmyeon because it's convenient. Cook various things at home."

"Oh, am I a child? I'm a high school student now."

"If you can't go to school, then what."

Translation:

"Ah! I want to go to school after a long time!"

Ignoring his younger brother's insincere words, Ryumin moved away.

"In my eyes, you're still just a kid."

He smiled faintly at the corner of his mouth.
