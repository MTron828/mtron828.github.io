Title: The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 257

Choice

In the 68th regression, where Ryu Min reached the 16th round for the first time, he fought against Battle Angels.

"It wasn't just a fight, but a massacre."

At that time, ten Battle Angels appeared.

Their purpose was simple.

"Their goal was to side with the monsters and obstruct the players."

It was the first time that Angels, who had not intervened in quests before, intruded.

"It was awkward and surprising."

The sudden interference was awkward, and they were weaker than expected.

Of course, if there were lethal attacks, Ryu Min wouldn't have been able to resist and his head would have exploded.

"But at that time, the Angels couldn't use lethal attacks."

According to the information obtained so far, lethal attacks could not be used in the 16th round.

The reason is unknown.

"It's probably because the system imposed restrictions to balance things. If everyone could use lethal attacks, anyone could be killed with a single blow."

Why the Angels were obstructing the players was unclear.

What was important is that lethal attacks couldn't be used.

At that time, for Ryu Min, who didn't have the title "Presence of the Fallen," which was a countermeasure against lethal attacks, it was a fortunate situation.

"It was too easy. Without lethal attacks, and they were only 6th-grade Battle Angels at best."

Sixth grade is the level of ordinary equipment for players at the maximum level.

Perhaps at the current level of level 70, five people could easily deal with one.

"I faced them alone back then, though."

Ryu Min of the 68th regression was strong.

Strong enough to massacre ten 6th-grade Battle Angels alone.

"After killing all the Angels at that time, the Archangel appeared."

The Archangel, presumed to be ranked 1st, did not pose any threat or attack Ryu Min.

Ryu Min couldn't even dare to challenge the overwhelming strength.

"He just said some inexplicable words and disappeared. I don't remember it well."

Perhaps this time, too, 6th-grade Angels will appear.

It's not until the last 6th-wave that they will appear, so there is still plenty of time.

"You foolish Angel, didn't you know we would gather on the island?"

"Black Scythe-nim has conquered again this time."

"If we hadn't come to the island early, I wonder what would have happened to our family by now...."

"This is all thanks to Black Scythe-nim. Thank you!"

The followers of the Death Cult who were present all expressed their gratitude to Ryu Min.

Even Alex, who had a skeptical look as if he couldn't believe in his own strategy, now had a newfound trust.

"Fortunately, it seems I've gained the trust of the newcomers."

The new followers would now genuinely pledge their loyalty to Ryu Min after this incident.

This applied to Alex, who was right in front of him, wearing a mask, and Ryu Min's mouth under the mask curved satisfactorily...

"Huh?"

However, Ryu Min couldn't help but pause as he noticed Min Joo-ri conversing with Alex.

He knew she was looking for the prophet.

"Receive these buffs."

As Min Joo-ri's hand reached out to the followers, a set of three buffs were applied.

"Wow, thank you!"

Min Joo-ri, nodding her head, immediately turned her gaze to another player.

With 576 players here, there was no time to rest to apply buffs to everyone.

Then, Min Joo-ri noticed a player standing alone, somewhat isolated.

As he was a foreigner, she spoke to him in slightly awkward English.

"Hello? Are you a newcomer?"

"Yes, my name is Alex."

"I'm Min Joo-ri. May I bother you for a moment?"

Although Alex was puzzled for a moment, it didn't last long.

After receiving the buffs named Bless, Swift, and Safety Barrier, his eyes widened in amazement.

"T-this is..."

"It's a buff. It'll be useful for you. Well then, I'm busy, so I'll be going now..."

Min Joo-ri turned away from his surprised gaze and headed towards another person.

Meanwhile, she occasionally looked around as if searching for someone.

"Where could he be?"

All players worldwide had been integrated into the Death Cult.

Among them, there should be Ryu Min, who was a prophet class.

"But I can't see him anywhere."

Although she was applying buffs to everyone she met, there was no sign of Ryu Min, whom she knew.

Even when trying to track him, the search results were the same.

[Cannot find the target 'Ryu Min.'] [Face and name do not match.]

"Why does it keep saying it doesn't match?"

She was sure she knew his real face and name.

Yet, Ryu Min was not found in the search results.
ChatGPT

"Did I change my name without telling anyone? Or did I get plastic surgery?"

It was an absurd thought, but there was no other way to explain it.

"I should have come with him no matter what when he suggested going to the island..."

When he invited her to the island, Ryu Min was the one who refused, saying he had something to do first.

But now that they've arrived at the island, Ryu Min is nowhere to be seen.

Just in case, Min Joo-ri counted the numbers while applying buffs...

"Thank you for the buffs, Min Joo-ri-nim!"

"Yes..."

In the end, Min Joo-ri couldn't find Ryu Min.

The person she buffed just a while ago turned out to be the last one.

"What happened? All 576 are on the island?"

But Min Joo-ri had never seen Ryu Min's face.

She checked each face while applying buffs.

Except for one person.

"Oh...!"

Min Joo-ri's gaze turned to a man wearing a white mask.

"Could it be Black Scythe-nim...?"

However, Min Joo-ri soon sighed and shook her head.

Even thinking about it herself, it was an absurd assumption.

"Black Scythe-nim can't be Ryu Min. Their heights are different, for starters."

Black Scythe was tall and had a robust physique, easily noticeable.

Even their skin tones were different.

The two couldn't possibly be the same person.

"Then where is he? Why can't I even track him?"

Min Joo-ri sighed deeply.

No matter how much she thought about it, it was an inexplicable situation.

"Black Scythe-nim."

Min Joo-ri decided to find Black Scythe first and report.

"I've applied buffs to all the members here as instructed."

"Good, well done."

Black Scythe nodded while Min Joo-ri stared at him in silence.

"It's ridiculous. Black Scythe being Ryu Min? Haha..."

Everything, from physique to voice and speech, was different.

There was no room for doubt, but maybe Black Scythe knew something.

"Black Scythe-nim, have you by any chance seen the Prophet?"

"The Prophet?"

"Yes... The number matches, but no matter how hard I look, I can't find him."

Ryu Min's eyebrows twitched for a moment, but it was just a fleeting moment.

"If you can't find him, why not try using the tracking ability?"

"Well, that... it says it's an unmatched target."

To that response, Ryu Min chuckled inwardly.
ChatGPT

"That's inevitable. I've transformed my appearance with the Assassin's Mask."

If you alter your appearance, you won't be caught by tracking.

Unless someone recalls the transformed appearance and name.

"I don't know either. I don't know what happened."

"Sigh..."

Although disappointed, Min Joo-ri seemed determined not to give up as she turned her gaze around diligently.

A message popped up, as if suggesting she should stop.

["First wave summon will begin shortly."] ["Prepare for the monster attack."]

"Stop looking for the Prophet and get ready for the attack."

"But..."

"Don't get distracted for no reason and end up getting stabbed."

"Alright... I'm sorry."

Seeing the disheartened Min Joo-ri made Ryu Min feel even more sorry.

"Black Scythe-nim."

Turning at the call, Russell and Victor were there.

"We've followed your orders and reinforced weapons and provided equipment buffs to the players."

"I've also finished distributing healing potions."

"Good job, both of you."

"Black Scythe-nim?"

This time, it was Kristin who approached.

"As you instructed, I applied the Saint's Blessing to all 576 players on my way here."

"Good, well done."

"Thank you."

Min Joo-ri, who had been watching Kristin with a smiling face, approached.

"Hey, Kristy?"

"Yes, Min Joo-ri-nim."

"You just mentioned buffing all 576, but did you count them accurately?"

"Yes. Including myself, it was 576. Why?"

"Well, you see..."

Looking around to make sure no one was listening, Min Joo-ri whispered.

"Have you, by any chance, not seen the Prophet? I've been looking for him, but he's nowhere to be found."

"Oh..."

After a moment of contemplation, Kristin shook her head apologetically.

"I haven't seen him either. I wasn't checking faces while applying buffs, so... I'm sorry. I couldn't be of help."

"Oh, no need to apologize. I understand."

Satisfied, Min Joo-ri, still determined to find him, disappeared into the crowd, unaware that Ryu Min was watching her from behind his mask.

"She's persistent. Trying to find him until the end."

The reason for the search could be understood by reading her thoughts.

If we hunt monsters together, we might become much closer...

It was a desire to deepen their relationship beyond the current state.
ChatGPT

More than just friends, into a relationship beyond that.

"Even in this otherworld, you're still on my mind."

There was no room for Black Scythe between Ryu Min and Min Joo-ri.

For her, Black Scythe was an admired, idolized figure, nothing more.

At that moment, their eyes coincidentally met with Kristin.

She sent a playful wink.

Did I do well? Prophet?

Reading her thoughts, it seemed she hoped for praise, but Ryu Min pretended not to see and turned his head.

The monsters would appear soon.

[First summon] [Player 576 vs Blood Orcs 5,760] [2nd summon in 30 minutes] [Time left until round ends: 02:59:59]

Thousands of orcs appeared, each holding a short sword.

Originally, they would have appeared near the city to massacre numerous civilians...

"Kwiik!"

"Kwiik?"

The orcs, appearing in a space surrounded by the sea, looked around in confusion, staring at the players.

It seemed they didn't expect to be summoned to such an isolated place.

"You filthy orc bastards!"

"No need for a long speech; let's kill them!"

"Waaaah!"

"Quick! Kwiik!"

Orcs and players clashed on the secluded island.

Despite being ten times more numerous, the Sin Cult was not overwhelmed.

The number wasn't crucial.

Thud! Thud!

Swing! Swipe!

"Kwiik!"

"Kwiik!"

In the isolated island, only the screams of orcs echoed.

[You have defeated the Blood Orcs!] [Experience gain increased by 1.5x due to title effect.] [Experience and gold increased by 2x due to Rune of Predation effect.] [Experience +0.0006%] [Gold +3] [Additional gold +1] [If there are too many party members, stat points and predation stacks won't be received.] [Current kill count: 36/100] [All stats increased by 36% due to Rune of Slaughter effect.] [There are 2,491 enemies within a radius of 100m.] [All stats increased by 100% due to Rune of Hundred effect.]

Ryu Min, killing the approaching orcs, swung the Black Scythe.

Kuququck-

"Kwiieek!"

"Kwaaak!"

With one swing, about 50 Blood Orcs were killed.
ChatGPT

Sweeping away the orcs as if cleaning the yard, the number of orcs noticeably decreased.

"It's convenient to be in a party. I don't have to worry about allies getting hurt."

Ryu Min slaughtered the orcs without restraint.

Since the ranking wasn't determined based on contributions as in the 14th round, there was no need to control his strength.

"It's a bit disappointing that the Rune of Predation doesn't accumulate stats and stacks."

The Rune of Predation grants stat points based on the level of defeated monsters. However, it couldn't be obtained now due to the hundreds of members in the party.

No stacks were accumulating either.

"Well, it's okay. There will be opportunities in the next round."

He could just continue slaughtering monsters without any worries.

Until the end of the 4th summon.

"I plan to leave the island during the 5th summon."

The reason was none other than the sub-quest.

"The sub-quest for this round is to save the lives of civilians for the first time. The one who saves a threatened civilian receives a reward."

The essential reward that must be obtained is the Rune of Yin and Yang.

For that, Ryu Min planned to briefly leave during the 5th summon.

"During the 5th summon, a flying monster, the Little Drake, will appear. What if I lure only one Little Drake outside the island, head towards the city, and kill it?"

It would be recognized as saving a civilian, securing the sub-quest reward.

"Until then, I'll sweep them away as much as I want."

With such thoughts, the 3rd wave was coming to an end.

Suddenly, a message appeared before Ryu Min.

[The target protected by the Hero's Blessing is under attack!] [You can use the Hero's Touch for 10 seconds.] [Please choose one of the following.]

└ 1. Move to the target.

└ 2. Summon the target.

[Time remaining for selection: 00:00:10]
