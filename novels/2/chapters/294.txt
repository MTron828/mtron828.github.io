Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 294"

Eternal Gear

As Ryu Min returned home, he lay silently on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

So many things had happened.

He killed Michael and suddenly became a god.

He went to the Demon Fortress for a test, and suddenly Artharos appeared.

And now, a quest to kill four divine beings had appeared.

'If I don't do the quest, it might stop...'

The problem was that the gods wouldn't leave him alone.

Hasn't he already caught the attention of the god Nix?

'I'll accept any challenge against me. As long as they don't recklessly touch my family.'

They might target his younger brother again, just like last time.

They might even reach out to his friends.

'No matter how strong I am, I'm alone. I can't protect everything.'

In that case, there was only one solution.

Eliminate the cause, and it will be over.

Isn't it true that you have to pull out the roots of a bad plant early?

'I haven't met the other gods yet, so I don't know... But what if I can defeat Artharos next time?'

Even though he had torn Artharos apart with the power of death, Artharos was still stronger than him.

Moreover, he possessed an undying body that didn't die no matter how many times he killed him.

'It's certain that he's the strongest among the enemies I've faced.'

Despite collecting runes, titles, and continuously growing, there were many strong opponents in the world.

'Plutocthos is strong in his own way too. At their level.'

Compared to Ryu Min, Plutocthos is no less powerful, even though he reigns as the Demon Lord in the Demon Realm.

However, Ryu Min isn't worried about him.

Because he's a really easy opponent.

'Next time I meet him, I should finish him off easily.'

In reality, there isn't much concern about Artharos either.

In terms of combat, he is confident in his victory.

It's just that Ryu Min, who escaped from the dimension of nothingness, killed the Celestials and gathered nearly 100 million stat points.

In terms of stats alone, he had almost doubled in strength.

Therefore, Ryu Min facing Artharos now and Ryu Min facing Artharos in the past are completely different.

Because his stats have doubled.

"There is a chance of victory. However, complacency is forbidden. We can't afford not to be prepared."

Stopping time, the immortal ability he possesses, the dimension of nothingness, and more – there are still many aspects he hasn't conquered.

"For now, I need to stack more stats. I must become stronger than I am now."

The real issue is not Artharos.

Other gods may be just as strong as Artharos.

It's an unpredictable situation where fights can break out at any time.

"What's certain is that Artharos will come after me soon."

He must have been watching.

Him mercilessly slaughtering both Celestials and demons to the extent that he might not think he lost his memories.

"He wouldn't just stay quiet with memories intact."

Surely, he will come back to tie up loose ends, and it could happen as soon as the 19th round.

"He probably won't appear in reality if he doesn't have to. Anyway, once the 19th round comes, my body will be brought back to the other world automatically."

Nevertheless, he can't just let things be and wait to be attacked.

Preparations are needed for the next encounter.

"Come to think of it, I received a title."

Ryu Min, suddenly remembering, opened his information window.

[Title – Max Level]

Acquisition condition: Achieve level 99 for the first time.

Effect: All stats increase according to the level.

There is a title he received for hitting max level for the first time, but with those stats, it's nearly impossible.

He needs to get stronger, and there's only one way to do that.

Nothing other than combinations.

By any means, he must create Eternal-grade equipment.

So, before opening the material pouch, Ryu Min prayed.

Prayed for condensed Aether to come out.

[You have used the Infinite Material Pouch.] [Congratulations! Five material items have appeared!] [Items will be given to the inventory!]

Ryu Min, checking the materials in the inventory, was astonished and immediately sat up.

"Two condensed Aether? Is this for real?"

Seeing the other three as unknown materials, they seem to be items needed for creating Eternal equipment.

"I have two refined Aether, so... I can make at least two pieces of Eternal equipment."

With the intention of making gloves and shoes, Ryu Min began combining the materials.
ChatGPT

Even though there is no blueprint, Ryu Min understands that one refined Aether and one condensed Aether must be included as sub-materials.

After placing them, he filled the remaining three slots with unknown materials and rotated the arrangement.

Without knowing the recipe, he has no choice but to guess and try.

Fortunately, luck seemed to be on his side, and he finally obtained an item.

[Combining Eternal-grade item.] [It takes time to create a high-quality item. Please be patient.] [Combining materials... ] [Analyzing the user's soul... ] [Synchronization in progress... ] [Combining successful!] [You have created 'Gauntlet of the Soul.'] [Gauntlet of the Soul]

Classification: Gloves

Grade: Eternal

Defense: 5,000

Effect: All stats +200, can absorb the souls of divine beings upon killing them, and use the abilities of the absorbed souls.

Durability: Infinite

Usage Restriction: Black Scythe (Soul-bound)

Description: An item bound to the soul, exerting influence not on the user's physical body but on the soul. It cannot be transferred to others. It can be applied simultaneously with other equipment items.

Upon seeing the options, Ryu Min was puzzled.

"What's this? Absorb the souls of divine beings?"

The option was blatantly telling him to kill gods.

"...Anyway, the effects are good."

The advantage of Eternal-grade equipment is that it can be worn simultaneously with god-grade equipment.

There's no need to discard the currently equipped items.

"I made one. Should I try making another one?"

Ryu Min continued his attempts.

[Invalid combination.] [Invalid combination.] [Invalid combination.]

............

............

Although failure messages appeared, Ryu Min did not feel discouraged. He calculated possibilities and systematically attempted again.

The result.

[Combining successful!] [You have created 'Stride of the Divine.']

He was able to produce another piece of Eternal equipment.

[Stride of the Divine]

Classification: Shoes

Grade: Eternal

Defense: 5,000

Effect: All stats +200, Movement speed +200%, inaudible footsteps, ability to walk in midair. Additionally, the skill 'Blink' can be used.

Durability: Infinite

Usage Restriction: Black Scythe (Soul-bound)
ChatGPT
Description: A soul-bound item that exerts influence on the soul, not the user's physical body. It cannot be transferred to others. It can be applied simultaneously with other equipment items.

Being able to walk through the air even in broad daylight, plus additional skills.

It was an item with many additional effects.

"I can use 'Blink'? What is it? Let me try it once."

[Temporary Skill - Blink]

Effect: Instantly teleport to a location within a 30m radius. Has a cooldown of 10 seconds.

As expected from its name, it was a teleportation skill.

"Huh, not only walking through the air, but I also gained teleportation."

Ryu Min's lips curled into a smirk.

Since the item was obtained, there was nothing to complain about.

"I made gloves and shoes... Now, the only thing left is an Eternal weapon?"

There isn't much time left in the rounds.

19, 20.

If he conquers just two more rounds, he can survive this tedious game.

"No, I can't be sure of that yet."

There is said to be a battle between Celestials and demons after the game with Michael.

The Celestials are said to be seeking long-term strategies for the current war.

"Do I have to perfectly end the war to escape from this game?"

He doesn't know.

He can only find out as events unfold.

"I don't know what will happen after round 20. But I'm quite familiar with round 19."

However, this time, Ryu Min had no intention of sharing information with others.

It wasn't about monopolizing information, but rather minimizing the confusion that would arise from sharing information.

"If people hear the current quest details, they might be shocked."

Deciding to keep quiet, Ryu Min didn't gather the followers of the Church of the Reaper, unlike usual.

This time, he had no intention of revealing the quest details.

It had been about two weeks since the return from round 18.

Yet, Huh Tae-seok hadn't received any contact from the gods.

"Why is there no contact? Usually, within three or four days, the Black Scythe would contact and instruct us to gather the followers... Is something wrong?"

The Black Scythe was the one who usually summoned the followers to convey information about the next round.

But now, there was complete silence, to the point that unnecessary worries arose.

With curiosity, Huh Tae-seok picked up and put down his phone repeatedly.

No matter what, the other party is someone he reveres as a god.

In truth, he was afraid to make the call first.

"What if something really happened?"
ChatGPT

Summoning his courage, Huh Tae-seok called the Black Scythe.

Ring, ring, ring - click.

Unexpectedly, the call was quickly answered, leaving Huh Tae-seok momentarily speechless.

Lord Huh. What's going on? Why the silence?

"Uh, Black Scythe? Nothing's wrong, right? Haha..."

Just get to the point. What's the matter?

"Ah, it's just that... Recently, there have been inquiries from the Church of the Reaper."

What inquiries?

"They asked if it was a mistake that the summoning messages weren't sent. They said they haven't received any contact for two weeks. So, I told them. We haven't received any contact from the Black Scythe either. There are no scheduled events..."

....

"Could something have happened? Are you busy?"

It's not like that.

"Then why aren't you gathering people?"

-I don't know.

"What?"

I don't know about the information for round 19 either. I couldn't choose information from the reward box this time.

"Uh, then..."

I also don't know anything, so I have no information to share. It seems like everyone will have to figure things out for themselves in the next round.

"Oh..."

Huh Tae-seok, momentarily lost for words, quickly regained his composure.

"Uh, then, can I convey what I just heard to the followers?"

Go ahead.

"Understood. Please rest well."

After confirming the end of the call, Huh Tae-seok let out a deep sigh as he put down his phone.

"Ah, facing the next round without any information."

In fact, this was normal.

It didn't make sense to always know the quest in advance and hear the strategy. Wasn't sharing the 1st place reward the same thing?

"But now, is it impossible?"

He had always received information well, but now, he couldn't even get information for a single round.

Yet, the future seemed murky and daunting.

'This is more serious than I thought...'

There might even be resentment among the followers.

Not receiving the special treatment they always got would undoubtedly feel like a loss.

'Of course, it's not Black Scythe's fault. But others might not see it that way.'
ChatGPT

As is often the case, when people gather, there are always a few troublemakers.

It's hard to conclude that all 143 people are normal.

'There might be individuals trying to sow discord by casting suspicion on the Black Scythe.'

How can I help the Black Scythe?

Huh Tae-seok, who had been pondering deeply, quickly regained his composure and composed a group message.

Hoping for no backlash from the people.
