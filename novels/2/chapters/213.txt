Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 213"

Explanation
Reporting ends here. And I have handled the tasks you instructed.

"Good, well done. Just in case, stay close to people until the situation is over."

Understood. Master.

As Ryu Min hung up Yantti's call, he thought to himself.

Whether long or short, this tragic fate has come to an end.

"I never intended to kill Makyung Rok originally."

If possible, he had planned to take it up to Round 20.

Makyung Rok's power was more than enough to be used to its full extent.

"But what I need is a reliable supporter rather than a dealer who has an inferiority complex towards me."

If he had to choose between Makyung Rok and Kristin, Kristin was undoubtedly the one.

Of course, whether Makyung Rok had an inferiority complex or not, he could turn him into an ally.

It was a problem easily solved by using Yantti to dominate him.

"For one, he tried to kill his own brother."

Since family members were trying to kill each other, it was none of his business.

It was just a matter of taking advantage of the situation to make Kristin firmly on his side.

"Even if I have to give up the power called Makyung Rok, holding onto Kristin is better."

With that judgment, the operation was simple.

He called Kristin and Seo Arin to witness Makyung Rok's wrongdoing and instill hatred.

Then, naturally, they would distance themselves from Makyung Rok.

"It went well according to the plan up to that point. The problem is that Kristin took action."

Ryu Min only wanted to know Makyung Rok's true identity and be done with it.

But according to recent reports, Kristin took action to save Makyung Soo.

It was an unexpected twist.

"Because of that, Kristin and Seo Arin were in danger of being killed."

It falls into the predictable category for the culprit to kill the witnesses to eliminate evidence.

So, Ryu Min had attached Jeffrey, Joo Sungtak, and even Yantti to prevent unforeseen accidents.

"As long as Yantti is there, nothing big will happen."

However, surprisingly, Joo Sungtak played a significant role.

He managed to create a situation where Makyung Rok was in a state of near-death through the explosion of the corpse.

A situation where Yantti didn't need to step in.

"But I couldn't kill him."

Because of that, Ryu Min, who was receiving real-time reports from Yantti, had to modify the plan.

To decisively kill Makyung Rok.

Immediately approach Makyung Rok secretly and dominate An Sang-chul. Then, act like you're protecting Makyung Rok, escape, and take the opportunity to kill him.

That was the command given to Yantti.

In addition, she was instructed to clear the body if Makyung Rok was killed, and even to commit suicide.

As a result, she executed it excellently.

"I originally had no intention of killing Makyung Rok, but since there was friction with Kristin, I couldn't just stand by."

If he had stayed quiet, there would have been no problem, but Kristin got involved in the situation and exposed herself.

As a result, Makyung Rok tried to kill the witness, Kristin.

"Because of that, they became a relationship that couldn't coexist. They both couldn't have it."

He couldn't bring the two who weren't getting along to Round 20.

One of them had to be discarded.

That's why he gave such instructions to Yantti.

To kill Makyung Rok.

The results are as follows.

[Target 'Makyung Rok' cannot be found.] [Non-existent person.] [Target 'An Sang-chul' cannot be found.] [Non-existent person.]

He killed them both as planned.

The evidence is that there is no trace to trace.

"Makyung Rok erased the traces himself. An Sang-chul committed suicide as ordered."

Not withdrawing the stocks was to avoid suspicion from Makyung Rok, but now there's no reason not to withdraw them.

"I need to sell all the stocks I have."

Roughly, it will generate around 1 trillion won, but in return, the company will go bankrupt.

"Anyway, it's time for the company to go under. Without Makyung Rok, there's no reason to keep the stocks."

Although he had to handle Makyung Rok and An Sang-chul unintentionally, he still managed to conclude it neatly.

All that remains is to convince the people.

Just then, a video call comes in from Jeffrey.

Ryu Min, wearing a white mask, answers the call.

"Jeffy."

Lord Black Scythe.

"Why is your face like that? What happened?"

Pretending not to know, he asked, and Jeffrey showed him the devastated scene, explaining the details of the incident.
ChatGPT

Ryu Min already knew everything as he received reports from Yantti, but hearing it for the first time felt significant.

"So, there was eventually a collision. Anyone injured?"

Fortunately, no one was hurt. However, the people here would like to hear Lord Black Scythe's explanation.

At that moment, Kristin and Seo Arin unexpectedly appeared on the screen.

"Hello, Lord Black Scythe. I apologize for calling you all of a sudden. We have some questions."

"Try to guess what it is. You must be curious about how we found out about Makyung Rok's actions, right?"

Exactly. And also the exact reason why you called us here.

Ryu Min organized his thoughts in his mind. It was a moment that required an explanation, or rather, clarification.

"Some of you may already know, but I have been communicating with a prophet named Ryu Min. It hasn't been long."

Looking at the nodding people, Ryu Min continued.

"I received one piece of information from him. Someone using the nickname 'Cheonma'—a person named Makyung Rok—intended to kill his family at a specific location. And he is someone associated with you. I also learned that one is an fiancée, and the other is an actress."

Ahh.

Now that they heard about the prophecy from Ryu Min, the two understood.

When did you receive that prophecy?

"Before Round 12 started."

So, almost a month ago?

"Yes. Because I knew it in advance, I couldn't view the person named Cheonma favorably. That's why I rejected the party invitation in Round 12."

Oh! So...!

Seo Arin, who had quietly partied with Minkyung only, now understood and looked somewhat regretful.

"As we progressed through the rounds, I silently struggled. Whether I should inform you, who didn't know the identity of the family-killing murderer, or if it's better to not get involved even if we know."

Hearing that the stoic Lord Black Scythe had agonized over this decision for their sake, Kristin and Seo Arin couldn't help but be surprised.

"If I hadn't heard the prophecy, I might have remained silent. But once I heard those words, I couldn't stay quiet, feeling uneasy. I had to do something. I also learned that Jeffry had a connection with Kristin, so I asked for his help."

So, you asked us to come here?

Ryu Min nodded while looking at Kristin, who spoke in his place.
ChatGPT

"I had a situation where I couldn't move personally. So, I gathered you there through Jeffry and Joo Sungtak. I wanted you to see Makyung Rok's true identity with your own eyes."

Although mixed with falsehoods, it was partly true.

It was indeed an intention to bring them there just to confirm the identity.

"I could have told you over the phone, but I thought you probably wouldn't have believed it. I felt that confirming with your own eyes would be more certain. That's why I created this situation."

Ah, I see.

"Of course, whether you want to cut ties with Makyung Rok or not is your decision. But I didn't expect such a twist to happen."

We didn't expect it either. That Makyung Rok was such a murderer...

Now that he's escaped, he might come back for revenge later, right?

Whether they tried tracking or not, they still didn't know that Makyung Rok and An Sang-chul were dead.

"Well, without saying, they'll naturally find out."

Ryu Min didn't mention this part and concluded the conversation.

"Is your curiosity satisfied now?"

Yes, Lord Black Scythe. We understand now.

Why did the prophet inform Lord Black Scythe about that prophecy?

"Well, I don't know that far. He's like a noble who's impossible to read."

Ryu Min stopped talking here.

Saying anything that seemed to praise the prophet could lead to suspicions of a scam.

It's better to leave it to their imagination.

"Now what?"

First, we should report to the police. Two people are dead...

"Leave that part to me. As the leader of CPF, I can handle it."

Just mentioning the prophet during a police investigation could complicate the situation.

This was a preemptive measure to block that.

"I'm sorry for putting you through this unexpectedly difficult situation. Go back and rest."

Thank you for your consideration. Please rest well too, Lord Black Scythe.

"Then, let's see each other in the next round."

Yes, take care.

Ryu Min immediately sent a message to Yantti after putting down his phone.

[Black Scythe: Inform the police chief and handle the situation. Announce that Makyung Rok is dead. However, avoid mentioning anything about the prophet.] [Yantti: Yes, I will execute it immediately.]

Putting away his phone, Ryu Min took his steps forward.

The Makyung Rok incident was successfully concluded, and business matters in the United States were also settled.

Now it was time to return to Korea.

One week since Makyung Rok's death.

Although it was a short period, many changes had occurred during that time.

Firstly, Ryu Min had become a millionaire, surpassing the conglomerates.

Thanks to selling all the stocks he owned, his net worth exceeded 1 trillion won. Just by depositing it in the bank, he would earn over 100 billion in interest annually.

Although he could have earned more by entrusting it to a fund manager, Ryu Min, who wasn't greedy for money, decided to safely keep it in the bank.

The second change was the collapse of Makyung Rok's company.

Having withdrawn a total of 31% of the shares, it was natural for the company to falter.

"Even if I hadn't withdrawn, the company was going to fail anyway."

With the player count decreasing by half and further diminishing to one-fourth when reaching Round 15, there was no logical expectation for the business to prosper.

Even with increased promotions for VVIPs, there were limits to sustainability.

Bringing it this far alone could be considered a miracle.

"Besides, the CEO is also gone now."

The news of Makyung Rok's death was revealed a day later.

Ryu Min, who had acquired the position of police chief, ordered the disclosure of Makyung Rok's death, and soon after, an article was released.

The eldest son of Oh Sung Group, Makyung Rok, killed his brothers in a succession dispute, betrayed by his subordinates, and died.

Whatever the reason, since he killed his family, the public's reaction was not favorable.

The stock price of Oh Sung Group naturally dropped.

"In addition, we investigated Makyung Rok's warehouse, revealing all his past murders."

The true nature of the numerous crimes committed by Makyung Rok in the past came to light.

As a result, Makyung Rok's stock price plummeted like a roller coaster.

In addition, Oh Sung Group suffered damage, and Chairman Ma Dae-cheol's reputation became irreparable.

"It'll be hard to recover the image for a while."

After the unprecedented event of all successors to Oh Sung Group being killed.

Various speculations arose on the internet about who would take over the group.

"Whether it happens or not, it's none of my concern now."

At the peak, he sold off stocks, securing significant profits, and eliminated Makyung Rok.
ChatGPT

He had become a person with no connection to Oh Sung Group.

"With this, the fate with Makyung Rok has come to an end."

The individual he had anticipated causing trouble someday had indeed attempted to silence Kristin and Seo Arin by killing them.

"Perhaps, if he had spared them, he would have regretted it for a long time. They might have sought revenge, not only against Kristin and Seo Arin but also against me."

He felt no remorse for what he had done. Leaving an aftermath was better than nothing.

There were no loose ends.

"After all, people don't know that I killed Makyung Rok. They believe it was done by An Sang-cheol."

The police searched the mountains and found An Sang-cheol's body.

However, no matter how much they searched, they couldn't find Makyung Rok's body.

Because of this, the police concluded that An Sang-cheol killed Maky
