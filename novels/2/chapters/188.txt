So far, with many territories, integration and representatives changed frequently, but not anymore.

As the territories have been consolidated into one, I became the sole representative, with the exclusive authority to rule.

'Now, if I set my mind to it, I can control the players as I please. Well, I'll try to save it as much as possible for the final moments.'

Since opportunities are limited, it's wise to conserve authority as much as possible.

[Now that the results are out, let's take the time to eliminate all teams below 95th place in points.]

"No, please! Angel!"

"Don't do this...."

As the angel signaled, the annihilation process began. Half of the teams turned into ashes, screaming.

"Now there are exactly 40,021 survivors. More than you thought, right?"

'Yeah, right, "more than you thought" my foot....'

To say that when only 30% remained compared to the beginning is surely mocking.

"Congratulations to the 95 surviving teams. And rewards will be given to the top 3 individual rankings."

As soon as the angel finished speaking, messages appeared one after another.

[Congratulations! You have achieved the quest as the 1st in this territory!] [Currently, 'Black Scythe' is ranked 1st in this territory.] [As the 1st in the territory ranking, 'Material Package' is granted as a reward!] [As the 1st in the territory ranking, 'Rune Package' is granted as a reward!] [As the 1st in the territory ranking, 'Special Reward Selection Box' is granted as a reward!]

Although the rewards were said to be generous from this round, three items indeed came in.

Ryumin smiled and immediately used the Rune Package.

[You have used the Rune Package.] [Congratulations! 'Rune of Expansion' has appeared!] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!] [Rune of Expansion]

Effect: Allows wearing one additional ring item.

'Oh, nice. A good one came out.'

Originally, you could only wear one ring. But thanks to the Rune of Expansion, you could now wear two.

'Considering the importance of items, being able to wear one more is a tremendous advantage.'

Satisfied with the quite good rune, Ryumin continued the momentum and also used the Material Package.

[You have used the Material Package.] [Congratulations! Black Iron Powder has been obtained!] [Congratulations! Bubbling Magical Solution has been obtained!] [Congratulations! Shiny Mane Tail has been obtained!] [Congratulations! Divine Material Leather has been obtained!] [Congratulations! Design: God-Grade Gloves has been obtained!]

With that, various God-Grade materials poured into Ryumin's inventory.

They even blatantly gave me a design to make God-Grade items.

'I don't need the design. I've memorized all the combinations.'

Later, I could easily put the designs on the market and make a tremendous profit.

Especially considering it was a God-Grade item crafting design.

'All the materials are here, except for the condensed Aether, the hardest to obtain.'

No big deal.

Ryumin had condensed Aether obtained by killing Archangel Remiel.

'I can make the third God-Grade item with this.'

The crafting speed was faster than expected.

Not that it wasn't, but I didn't expect to get condensed Aether by killing the Archangel.

'For now, I'll make the God-Grade gloves after returning....'

Ryumin used the last remaining Special Reward Selection Box.

[You can choose one of the following special rewards.] [Please touch the desired reward.]

└ 1. Experience x2 Buff (Limited to 12 rounds)

└ 2. Stat 50% Increase Buff (Limited to 12 rounds)

└ 3. Information about Round 12

Seeing the list, Ryumin chose 2 without hesitation.

'From now on, stat increase is more important than experience. I can level up later.'

The angels suspecting themselves as the culprit won't stay quiet forever.

To be prepared for any potential attack, it's better to increase stats.

[Have you all received your rewards? Now, let's open the Special Shop!]

As the angel finished speaking, messages appeared eerily.

[The Special Shop has been opened in the shop window!] [The Special Shop is a store where you can purchase more special items with points. The shop will stay open even after the round, so take your time to explore and make purchases. Oh, and be careful with your points, as there won't be any more given in the future!]

Despite the angel's additional explanation, people seemed to hear but not pay much attention.

Everyone was too busy exploring the shop.

Ryumin could also check the Special Shop but decided to leave it for later.

There's no rush to look around after returning.
ChatGPT

[Congratulations, everyone. Well then, see you in the next round!]

◀ ROUND 11 Ends ▶

[Zone CA-EA001]

└ Survivors: 40,021

[After a while, your soul will transition back to your original dimension.] [Round 12 will start at midnight on December 1, 2022. Congratulations on surviving. See you in the next round.]

After Round 11 ended,

The angel Milen, who had been in charge of guidance, sighed and returned to heaven.

"Indeed, an extraordinary human. To survive in that difficult high-risk method."

Milen thought of the human known as Black Scythe.

He exuded a stern atmosphere in the avatar theme created in the otherworld.

'Did that guy, Black Scythe, really kill the Archangel as rumored?'

Rumors of Remiel's death were not officially confirmed, but informed angels knew everything.

That he went to face humans and died.

'Considering that the Archangel hasn't returned so far, it seems likely.'

Did the Archangel die at the hands of a human?

It was still an unbelievable story, but if it's true, there's only one suspect.

'Black Scythe, who showed an unparalleled presence at level 90. It can only be attributed to him.'

Although a suspect had been identified, there were no specific measures taken by the higher-ups.

It was hard to understand why they hadn't taken immediate action, considering the gravity of the situation.

"Hmm, I can't figure out what the higher-ups are thinking... Huh?"

At that moment, a shining angel appeared in front of Milen.

Milen, frozen as if overwhelmed by the majestic and beautiful wings and the profound gaze of the angel, couldn't move.

[Ah, the top of the top. The Archangel of Archangels, I greet you, Archangel Michael.]

Afraid that the angel might have heard her previous words, Milen greeted with trembling.

As Michael looked down at Milen, he asked in a deep and low voice.

[I heard you were the angel in charge of guiding Round 11.] [Yes? Y-yes. Th-that's correct.]

Milen, still trembling, seemed pitiful, and Michael showed a gentle smile as if understanding her situation.
ChatGPT

[You wanted to hear the results early, so I appeared. Don't be too scared.] [Ah, I was on my way to record the results anyway.] [Alright. How did Round 11 turn out?] [Here's the recorded screen. Take a look.]

As Milen presented the result screen, Michael examined it with a serious gaze.

[Once again, Black Scythe took the first place. And with an overwhelming lead.] [Seems like he made a significant gain using the high-risk method in the late gambling arena.] [I see. Take it to the record room as it is.] [Yes, um, then I'll... leave now.]

As Milen retreated hesitantly, Michael was left pondering.

'While others are barely earning 200,000 points, he alone has 20 million points.'

This round was crucial as it involved earning points necessary for the Special Shop.

After this round, point acquisition would be impossible.

'As if knowing that fact, he earned an enormous amount of points, creating a gap that others can never catch up with.'

He truly was a monopolizer.

Dangerous.

Ignoring Black Scythe like this would not only disrupt the game balance but also put the angels at risk.

A chain murderer who had already killed dozens of battle angels and one Archangel?

'Yet...yet am I supposed to just stand by and watch?'

Michael recalled his recent conversation with Lubarhi.

You should target him when Round 11 starts.

I recommend waiting a bit more, not Round 11. It will be much more helpful in achieving Michael's justice.

What did you just say? Say it again.

I said that sparing Black Scythe would help achieve Michael's justice.

You, a mere observer confined to a small room, do you even know the depths of my intentions?

Of course. As an observer overseeing all knowledge in the world, do you think I wouldn't know the inner thoughts of Archangel Michael?

....

Let me speak straightforwardly. Michael, do you want to become a god? You know what is needed for that, don't you?

Are you suggesting I use Black Scythe?

Yes. Considering Black Scythe's actions so far, you can see that he is someone walking a path no one has ever walked before. He is the only being that can fulfill Michael's justice, the desire to become a god.
ChatGPT

Keep going.

If you kill Black Scythe now, accused of murdering the Archangel, Michael's justice will once again drift away. The reason you pay attention to the human's game is also to become a god, isn't it?

That's right.

Currently, the person closest to fulfilling the wish of Round 20 is Black Scythe. If you use him well, Michael can become a god. On the other hand, if you kill Black Scythe according to the regulations of heaven, Michael's justice will once again be distant.

....

What will you do? Will you postpone Black Scythe's death for the sake of justice? Or will you kill him now for the sake of heaven's order and wait for the next opportunity?

...Well, it's not a decision to make right now. I need some time to think.

After considering the matter, Michael sighed inwardly.

He had said he would think about it, but he hadn't reached a conclusion yet.

'Damn it. Why did he bring this up? What does he expect from me?'

Considering the sudden mention of this matter, it seemed like he wanted Michael to delay Black Scythe's death.

No, more likely, he wanted Michael to become a god himself.

'What do I gain by becoming a god?'

Even after thinking hard, he couldn't understand the motives of the enigmatic observer.

On the contrary, his thoughts only became more complicated.

'Do I let that cheeky puppy, who insulted angels for justice, live for the sake of justice?'

It was absurd, but Lubarhi's words made some sense.

To achieve justice, sacrifices were sometimes necessary.

Opportunities like this might not come again.

Justice, or personal greed?

Heaven's order, or individual desires?

In the midst of deep contemplation, Michael quietly made up his mind.

'...Angels are inherently a selfish race.'

He decided to tolerate Black Scythe's crimes for the sake of justice.
