Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 174"

Round 11 Begins

A day before the start of Round 11, Ryu Min met Min Juri.

"What is it that you want to tell me?"

"Yeah, this."

As Min Juri extended a slightly large ring case, her eyes widened like a rabbit's.

"W-what is this?"

"Open it."

With an excited heart, Min Juri unconsciously let out a gasp as she opened the case.

Because there was a dazzling 5-carat diamond shining brightly.

Thump-thump-thump-thump-

What, what should I say in response? I haven't prepared myself mentally yet.

Seeing Min Juri daydreaming, Ryu Min drew a line crisply.

"Don't misunderstand. It's a gift I received from an acquaintance, but I don't need it, so I'm giving it away."

"I don't need this?"

"What would a man do with jewelry? Sell it or use it as you like."

"How much is it?"

"They said it's valued at around 300 million emotionally."

"3, 3 hu-hu-hundred million?"

"It could be more."

"...."

Now, Min Juri couldn't even think of closing her mouth.

"Why are you giving this to me?"

"I told you. I don't need it."

"You could sell it."

"It's troublesome. Even if I sell it, it's just loose change for me."

"Do you know what just happened? Your luck changed, right?"

"It's true."

The company of Magyeongrok, with a market capitalization of 900 billion, doubled in just 8 months.

Naturally, Ryu Min's investment also doubled.

In essence, he now possessed assets close to 600 billion.

In that situation, why would someone bother about 300 million?

"I literally see it as a pittance. But for you, it might be more useful in the hands of someone who needs it."

"But, but..."

"Use it to help your father, and maybe play the role of a filial daughter. These days, running a convenience store isn't doing well for your father, right?"

"That's true, but there's no need for this. I don't want to incur any debts."

"Don't think of it as a debt. It's just friends helping each other. If it feels burdensome, just think of it as a gift."

"Who gives a 300 million-won gift?"

"There are. Rich people do things like that."

"...."
ChatGPT

Not uttering a word, she doesn't step back.

Instead, Min Juri finds herself pondering how to refuse in the first place.

"Just saying thank you is enough. No need to feel burdened."

"I really don't need this kind of help...."

Although she said that, Min Juri was honestly tempted.

She had been working at the convenience store with her father, but the sales were decreasing day by day. Even worse, she confessed to her father about using up the ten million won she received from Ryu Min for living expenses and being in a situation where she had to take out a loan.

Because of this, just the day before yesterday, she was contemplating selling the equipment she wore to make some quick money.

It was indeed a desperate situation, so she couldn't help but be swayed by the jewelry.

"Really... Can I really take this?"

"That's right."

"Thank you... But I won't just take it. I'll borrow it. I'll definitely pay it back with interest."

"Sure. Let's do that."

Min Juri took the diamond into her arms.

Expressing her gratitude towards Ryu Min.

"Thank you so much, really. But let's make this clear."

"What?"

"I am originally a filial daughter, you know?"

November 1st, 00:00:00.

The time to go to the other world was always precise.

Every 1st of the month, he would fall into a trance and collapse onto the bed.

Although his mind wandered in the meadow of the other world.

"Hello! All 690 human beings? This time, everyone came back without any deaths, what's going on?"

No deaths?

That's understandable.

"Most of them are Plceva members."

Out of the 690, 489 were members who remained in Plceva. Plceva members were chosen through rigorous personality tests, so there was no fighting among them.

"The remaining 201 also seem not to be fighting."

Perhaps due to the activities of the CPF unit led by the Black Scythe, there was no foolish criminal causing trouble throughout October. Seo Arin's CPF public service advertisements seemed to be helpful.

"Unless you're a fool, you'll understand. With so few people, fighting to the death only results in losses."

The more murders committed, the fewer TO (Target Object) achievements one could gain. It meant that the holes to pass through were only narrowing.

"Then, before explaining Round 11, since the number of participants is small, we should proceed with the zone integration first, right?"

The angel flapped its wings, and with a rumble, the meadow reassembled.

This time, being the fourth zone integration already, people didn't show any signs of confusion on their faces. However, they only seemed surprised when the complete integration was nearing its end.

"Are you surprised that there are more people? It's natural. We've integrated all the zones worldwide."

"All zones?"

No wonder there were people endlessly scattered across the meadow. Instead of proceeding in units of 5,000, the scale had become larger.

"The zone name is CA-EA001. As I mentioned, we have integrated all 190 zones worldwide, and the exact number of participants is 132,126. It's like 195 countries in terms of nations, but some countries with a large population are divided into multiple zones. Conversely, smaller countries may be combined with others."

"Indeed, places with a large population like India or China may have multiple zones. It's not like in our country where it ends with one zone."

Players who listened to the explanation nodded.

The reason the meadow was so crowded was that all countries had gathered. There were also a considerable number of angels. Floating in the sky to explain, it seemed like there were at least 190 of them.

They continued their explanations towards the people in their respective zones.

"We plan to continue with one zone in the future, so keep that in mind. Now, shall we reveal the quests for Round 11?"

◀ ROUND 11 ▶

└Accumulate points in the fantasy world for 24 hours

└???? Many

[Integrated Zone CA-EA001]

└Participating Zones: 190

└Achievement Zones: 0/95

"Huh? What's this?"

"Participating zones? Achievement zones?"

"Not participants and achievers?"

As players buzzed with questions about the quest window being different from usual, the angel explained.

"Did you fill the sub-quest count in the fantasy world last round? This time, it's a mission with a similar context. The difference is that it's a team battle where the team that accumulates the most points wins."

"A team battle...?"
ChatGPT

"That's correct. Unlike the previous rounds, which were based on individual scores, this time we will proceed with teams formed by zones."

"Teams by zones...?"

"Zones were just integrated."

"Of course, I'm talking about before the integration. Each zone had roughly 700 people forming parties. It's not a real party where experience points are shared, but rather a team that shares victory and defeat. Shall we call it a fate community?"

"Ah..."

Players nodded as if they understood.

"The quest is simple. Roam around the fantasy world, complete sub-quests, and accumulate points. The points you individually gather will be added to the team points. The team that accumulates the most points wins."

"Ah..."

"It's really a team battle..."

"You gain points individually, but the victory is shared by everyone."

"So even if someone can't accumulate many points, there's a chance of surviving?"

"Yes. As long as the team ranks high, even if someone doesn't accumulate points and just relaxes, they will still pass. The ranking is determined by the team with the most points, from 1st to 95th."

"Oh, so that's why it was written as participating zones and achievement zones, not participants and achievers."

Korean players looked at each other.

Now, instead of competitors to be surpassed, they had become a team sharing a ship.

"Just because we're a team doesn't mean we all receive rewards together. The ranking rewards received during result calculations are based on individual performance."

"So there's a separate individual ranking."

"But if you can't make it to the top 3, you won't receive rewards, right?"

"That's right."

"As the zones are integrated, the rewards for this round have been slightly enhanced. You all need to work hard to get into the top rankings."

Even with the angel's words, people still had skeptical expressions.

They didn't expect much from the ranking rewards that only three people could receive.

Just surviving by earning as many points as possible was enough for them.

"As the zones are integrated, we also need to reduce the zone representatives to one. We will select the player with the highest points based on individual performance as the integrated zone representative."

"The player with the highest individual score?"
ChatGPT

"Then I guess we'll have to give up on being zone representatives."

Even though no one said it out loud, they all thought it silently.

There was no guarantee that the Black Scythe would secure the 1st place again this time.

"Even for survival, you should work hard, but there's another reason to earn points. If you survive this round, a special shop will open, where you can use the points you've earned to purchase special buffs or items. Think of points as the currency for the special shop."

As players heard that they could use points as currency, a newfound enthusiasm appeared on their faces.

"Whatever happens, getting a lot of points is the most important."

"Now that it's like this, let's all work hard. Let's complete quests like crazy to accumulate points!"

Korean players looked at each other, filled with determination.

Many foreign players, whom they hadn't seen before, were noticeable. Changing races usually didn't involve much customization, making it possible to distinguish players from other countries.

"This round is like a national competition where countries compete against each other in terms of points."

Despite the enthusiasm, there was still something the angel hadn't mentioned – another method of gaining points.

"There are various ways to earn points. Within the 24-hour time limit, just like the previous round, completing sub-quests in various areas will earn you points based on difficulty. Killing monsters in the field will also yield points along with experience."

"Sounds simple."

"Just like last time, let's blitz through the sub-quests."

People who confidently spoke, laughing and joking, fell silent as soon as they heard the angel's next words.

"Oh, and killing other players also earns you points."

"...."

"I won't tell you how much. Try killing someone yourself and check. Do you think it'll be more than you expect? Hohohoheh."

Although the angel was smiling brightly, no one could follow suit.

"Points for killing people?"

"Then, even if we kill someone on the same team...?"

"No, that's a loss. Killing someone from the same team means losing a laborer that would have earned points for you."
ChatGPT

"If you want to kill, you have to kill people from other countries."

As the thoughts of the people were gradually conveyed, Ryu Min sighed and nodded nervously.

'It turned out just as the angel intended. We're going to treat each other as enemies and fight.'

The rule that killing people earns points is not there for no reason. It is a rule designed to make people wary of each other and engage in killing.

'By dividing them into countries like this, and in Round 12, giving quests for cooperation between different countries.'

Whoever designed it, it was quite a wicked hobby.

Quietly contemplating, Ryu Min looked at the players.

As if saying, 'When did this happen?' they broke the silence and were once again shouting 'fighting.'

"Now that it's like this, let's all work hard on the sub-quests!"

"There's nothing to be afraid of if we stick together!"

"Yes. We have the Black Scythe, the 1st ranker in our country!"

"Accumulating points is not that difficult! Let's all survive together!"

Cheering on, but it was only temporary.

"Now that the explanation is over, I will immediately send you to the fantasy world. Oh, by the way, the starting location is random."

"R-random?"

"Because it wouldn't be fun if everyone started in the same place."

Upon realizing that they would be scattered in different directions, everyone fell into silence.
