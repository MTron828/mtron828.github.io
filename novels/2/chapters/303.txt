Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player Episode 303"

What's Wrong with This Guy?

"Um, Ma-, Master? Are you okay?"

"Master?"

Even after calling Heo Tae-seok again, it was clear he couldn't understand a thing.

If he understood, would he be staring with unfocused eyes, saliva dripping like this?

It seemed as if his mind had escaped.

"Alex, why did Master Heo come here?"

"Is there any reason other than one?"

Alex tightened his grip on the staff, wearing a serious expression.

Victor and Sophia also eyed Heo Tae-seok with cautious glances.

It was inevitable for them to be on guard, considering they had just heard about the strained relationship between Alex and Heo Tae-seok.

"Master Heo, if you've come for revenge, please stop."

"We would appreciate it if you turned back."

Despite the objections, Heo Tae-seok didn't even acknowledge that he heard.

"Krururur...."

He only responded with beast-like growls.

At that moment, Alex and his group sensed something strange.

"He doesn't seem to understand a word we're saying."

"He's making weird noises."

"His skin doesn't look as red as before."

It was easy to notice that he was in a different state than usual.

When Heo Tae-seok, who had stopped moving, started again, Alex shouted.

"Don't come any closer! I warn you!"

"Kkhue, kkhue."

"Pretending not to understand like last time won't work! There's a translation function in this realm."

Despite the warning, Heo Tae-seok narrowed the distance.

"Kkhrurur...."

"Stop it!"

Undeterred by the warning, Alex, in a fit of rage, conjured an ice spear.

Pashasasak!

Even though the warning projectile flew towards the ground, Heo Tae-seok showed no sign of flinching.

The only difference from before was that it seemed to stimulate him.

"Kraaaa!"

In an instant, horns sprouted from Heo Tae-seok's forehead, and wings appeared.

His size increased by 30%, and a devilish tail grew.

It was the demonic transformation seen in their previous fight.

Alex, without hesitation, launched a preemptive strike.

Otherwise, he felt he might die.

"Alex!"

Shooshooosh-!
ChatGPT

Victor shouted as if to warn not to attack, but it was already too late.

If they didn't deal with the countless ice spears extending towards them, they would end up in a precarious situation.

However, Victor's worry did not materialize.

Heo Tae-seok agilely soared into the air, avoiding the danger.

Woo-woo-woo-

Around the airborne Heo Tae-seok, ten black arrows materialized.

Although Victor and his group were in a dire situation, Sofia blocked the path in front of them.

"Guardian Shield!"

The skill unfolded, and the black arrows fiercely attacked.

Kwakwakwakwakwang!

The impact was so formidable that it sounded like a bomber had just passed by.

However, Sofia's shield, unfolded as if it wasn't a big deal, remained intact.

"Is everyone okay?"

"Uh, yeah."

"Thanks to you."

Even as Victor and Alex behind Sofia replied, they felt a chilling sensation in the air.

If it weren't for Sofia, they might have been rolling on the ground as chunks of meat by now.

"Why are you doing this, Master Heo? Pull yourself together!"

"It's not supposed to be like this. Let's have a conversation, shall we? Huh?"

Despite the two shouting, Heo Tae-seok, who had not even acknowledged their words, dropped something instead of a reply.

The black seed that fell to the ground quickly sprouted, giving rise to a demon.

"Kkieeeeee!"

It was the top-tier demon called Requiem.

"Kyaeeek!"

Upon seeing the group, Requiem rushed towards them without hesitation.

At first glance, it looked like a hunting dog, but its size exceeded 3 meters.

They initially thought its movements would be slow due to its massive size, but that prejudice was quickly shattered.

Kwaang! Kdong-!

"Kryuk!"

The force pounding on the Guardian Shield was unbelievably strong.

"It's impossible to hold on any longer. It's going to collapse soon. We need to decide whether to fight or not."

Sofia's words changed Alex's expression.

It seemed like he would no longer adopt a defensive stance.

"Understood. From now on, we'll define enemies and actively engage in combat."

Immediately, the shield cast by Sofia was shattered.

Pachang-!

As soon as it happened, Requiem lunged forward, opening its mouth wide to devour them.

At that moment,

Whirrrrr-!

Prepared in advance, Alex's flame storm entered Requiem's mouth.

Boom!
ChatGPT

"Kiyaaaaah! Hyaaaaaah!"

No matter how accustomed one might be to living in hell, putting a pit of fire in one's mouth was simply unthinkable.

At that moment when the entire ceiling seemed to explode with the guy screaming and glowing.

"Restraint Chains!"

Sofia's skill briefly restrained Requiem by binding its legs, and ominously, ice spears consecutively stabbed into Requiem's face.

Puff puff puff puff-!

Thud!

With its face full of arrows, Requiem collapsed.

They thought they could take a breather, but the group had no time to relax and had to leap out of the way.

Dozens of black arrows again adorned the sky.

"Watch out!"

Kwakwakwakwakwang-!

The scattered three individuals looked at each other with furrowed brows.

For them, the well-being of others took precedence over their own safety.

"Are you okay?"

"Brother? Are you hurt?"

"Uh, I'm, I'm fine. I got a little scratched, but..."

It wasn't just a scratch; Victor's calves were covered in blood. However, there was nothing to worry about as long as he ingested a top-grade healing potion like this.

"Get down!"

As if unable to endure any longer, Alex shot a lightning spear towards the sky.

Zap zap!

Thinking it would be hard to dodge due to its high projectile speed, Heo Tae-seok effortlessly avoided it, making Alex's counterattack futile.

"Khh."

Smirking as if mocking, Heo Tae-seok, with a momentary serious expression, descended like an arrow.

"Gasp!"

Caught off guard by the incredible speed, Alex hurriedly deployed a barrier towards the sky.

However, the strength of the barrier was extraordinary, and with a single punch, Heo Tae-seok, in his demonic form, shattered it.

Thud!

Enlarged by demonic transformation, Heo Tae-seok's hand instantly gripped Alex's throat.

As Alex struggled, his vision started to blur.

"Kwack! Cough!"

"Khhuhuhuhu."

Unable to breathe, every passing second seemed like an eternity.

Realizing his fate, Alex had no more options.

As if unable to watch such a sight, Sofia swung her sword.

"Suppression!"

Intending to cut off the arm entirely.
ChatGPT

However, Heo Tae-seok's remaining hand grabbed Sofia's sword.

Squelch-!

"Ik!"

Sofia, classified as a tank in the tanker position with the profession called Guardian, still had a relatively high strength stat.

Nevertheless, Heo Tae-seok, even with just the hand holding the sword, showed no signs of being pushed back, despite the apparent difference in strength.

Even though he should only be a warlock.

"You crazy cult bastard! Let go of Alex!"

"Khhuhuhu."

Heo Tae-seok, who let out a mocking laugh, tightened his grip on Alex's throat even more.

"Kuk! Kyeak!"

At that moment, right before Alex was about to lose consciousness.

Suddenly, Victor, who was not thought much of, pulled out his weapon and rushed forward.

"No, brother!"

Even if it might not be of help, he couldn't stand by and watch a colleague die.

With such determination, he rushed in, intending to at least poke Heo Tae-seok in the eye. However, even the delirious Heo Tae-seok was aware of this fact.

As if declaring that he would pierce the heart with his tail, he stabbed it precisely through Victor's chest.

Pooch!

With his chest pierced, Victor opened his eyes wide.

The tail had penetrated precisely through his heart.

However, Victor did not die and moved.

Moving in such a way, he thrust the dagger into Heo Tae-seok's eye.

"Kke, Kkehaaaa!"

Even though he tried to block the sword with his bare hands, it seemed that his eye was not as tough as his eyeball. Heo Tae-seok screamed, releasing his grip on Alex.

Thanks to this, Alex, who had almost reached the threshold of death, could barely catch his breath.

"Khaaaah! Khaaaaaaah!"

Seeing the suffering and anguished Heo Tae-seok, Victor wore an astonished expression.

"How, how am I still alive?"

Although it felt like his chest had been pierced, no blood came out, and he felt no pain.

He didn't know the reason, but there was no time to contemplate.

Thump-

"Sofia!"

Sofia inexplicably collapsed, bleeding.

"Why? Where are you hurt?"

"Cough...."

As if answering on her behalf, blood spread from her chest.

In that moment, a skill came to Victor's mind.

"Did you... sacrifice yourself?"

Guardian's level 60 skill, [Sacrifice].

A sacrifice skill that can be cast on a designated person, allowing them to substitute for someone else's death.

Seeing blood unexpectedly flowing from her chest confirmed it.

"You... you said you wouldn't use that skill! You said you wouldn't use it on me!"

"…Oh, brother... did you... believe those words? Like a fool..."

"You fool! Why did you cast that on me, knowing well I don't have a potion of life!"

"Hehe, alive... live in my place...."

Sofia couldn't finish her sentence and closed her eyes.

"Uwaaaaah!"

Tears of blood flowed from Victor's eyes.

He wanted to save her, but he didn't have a potion prepared.

Potions of life, which resurrect others, were difficult to obtain due to the rarity of ingredients.

Of course, that didn't mean there was no way to revive Sofia.

'Krishi. The only person with the resurrection skill besides me.'

If he called her, he could resurrect Sofia.

The problem was that he had to call her within 10 minutes.

But that wasn't the only problem they faced.

"Krrrrrr...."

If Heo Tae-seok didn't send it, both Alex and Victor would die here.

It seemed he had no intention of sending it.

Shalararalak-!

"Ugh!"

Heo Tae-seok, who hung Victor in the air with black chains, approached step by step.

His whole body exuding vitality.

"Kreuuuu...."

As if he was going to take out Victor's heart like taking a mountain, Heo Tae-seok raised his hand when he gripped his arm.

"Master?"

Turning his head, Eom Joon-seok looked at Heo Tae-seok with a bewildered face.

"W-what is this..."

Alex, like someone who had died and come back to life, was barely catching his breath, and Sofia had become a cold corpse, bleeding from her chest.

If Victor hadn't called, he would have been pierced through the chest.

Swish-!

"Stop it, Master!"

Although he didn't know the exact situation, Eom Joon-seok drew his sword for now.

He traced it because the only person he could rely on was the Master.

"What is happening, even in a round where we are supposed to kill each other! You won't be forgiven for a lifetime! So stop th..."

Realizing that words were useless, Eom Joon-seok recognized it after seeing Heo Tae-seok's eyes.

"Kreueueue...."

With eyes devoid of reason, a bizarre cry, it was clear that communication was not possible with him.

"Spare us, Master!"

Eom Joon-seok did not know the details, but he drew his sword for now.

He had traced it because the only person he could rely on was the Master.

"I'm sorry, Master. Please forgive Ha-guk-sang. Ha-aaaap!"

"Khaaaaah!"

Eom Joon-seok rushed forward, holding his sword.

Even though he had no talent in the ordinary warrior profession, he had survived until the 19th round.

Whether he could defeat the cult leader who had not been defeated by the scattered three people was uncertain, but his determination remained unbroken.

'I won't let him off easily....'

However.

Crash!

Seeing his sword easily break in Heo Tae-seok's grip, Eom Joon-seok was left speechless.

A sense of frustration left him in a daze.

Kwaak-!

"Kkuueuk!"

He was instantly grabbed by the throat, and both feet were lifted off the ground into the air.

"Kkuue...."

Feeling helpless, being unable to launch any counterattacks, he felt self-loathing.

'A worthless person like me, struggling like this...'

Wouldn't it be better for someone useless like him to just die, rather than being a burden to his comrades?

While entertaining such thoughts, Eom Joon-seok's body dropped downward.

'In the end, I died.'

He thought so, but what fell wasn't his own neck; it was Heo Tae-seok's arm.

"Huuk, huuk."

Breathing heavily, he looked up to find a savior with cold eyes, retrieving the sickle while looking down at Heo Tae-seok.

"Why is this guy like this?"
