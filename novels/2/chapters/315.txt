Title: "Chapter 315 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

Has It Improved Now?

'Has it improved now?'

Having received a message from Minjoo to meet, Ryu Min headed to the agreed-upon place with hopeful expectations.

Ding-

As he opened the cafe door, Minjoo, who had been waiting, came into view.

"Here."

Her expression, shaking hands, seemed relieved, as if her thoughts had finally settled.

"Did you wait long?"

"No. Not really."

Although Minjoo said she didn't wait long, Ryu Min could read that it wasn't the case.

'Waited for an hour?'

What could she have been thinking, sitting alone for an entire hour?

Seeing worry on Ryu Min's face, Minjoo smiled as if to reassure him.

As if to say there was nothing to worry about.

"Sit down quickly."

"Uh, sure."

"I received a summon from the Divine Altar. Sorry. I couldn't attend because I had a lot on my mind."

"It's okay."

Minjoo spoke in a calm voice.

Ryu Min, who knew better than anyone that she looked fine on the surface but felt uneasy inside, understood.

"They distributed 23 billion gold to each player?"

"How did you find out?"

"I heard it from Arin. She kept sending messages asking why you didn't come."

Minjoo, who had been laughing carefreely as if she had no worries or concerns, suddenly sent a gaze filled with admiration.

"It's truly remarkable. I read in the news that you even made a donation, nearly reaching 1 trillion."

"Well..."

"Really impressive. I couldn't have done that. How could you donate 99% of your wealth?"

"Since it's almost the last round, I felt the need to settle things. It might be the end of my life, after all."

"Do you remember the Black Scythe I knew? Why are you talking like that? Wasn't he full of charisma with that Black Scythe?"

"..."

While Minjoo was playfully raising the corners of her mouth and laughing, Ryu Min silently observed.

As if signaling that the act could stop now.

Then, from the face that seemed like it would keep laughing forever, the laughter disappeared.

"Sigh... It's tough after all. Conversing like we used to."

"..."

"Even if you don't look at me with that gaze, I know. I've realized now. How foolish I was."
ChatGPT

Minjoo no longer smiled.

Her face was filled with worry and concern as she let out a long sigh.

"I had a one-sided crush for three years. Considering the time spent in the survival game, it's been four years. During all that time, I only had eyes for Ryu Min, my friend. But..."

Minjoo, pausing for a moment, sighed and continued.

"I was the one who turned away first. Like a fool."

"Well, the psychological impact must have been significant."

"Yeah, it was. I was shocked when I found out his true identity. How could my friend be the Black Scythe? How could he deceive me, his friend? After four years of unrequited love?"

"..."

"You really thought that way? Isn't it absurd? What was I thinking? Unrequited love for four years? Without doing anything. Without making any effort. I acted as if you were already mine, and I created and cut your image as I pleased. So, when I realized that two people I thought were completely different were the same person, it was a huge shock. The image that had taken root like a prejudice shattered in an instant."

"..."

"Out of fear that those fragments might become scars, I pushed you away. The cause was in me, but I only found fault in you. Blamed you."

Minjoo, who seemed unlikely to smile, momentarily displayed a self-deprecating smile.

"Isn't it funny? Pushing away and resenting someone you love, afraid that it might become a wound for yourself."

"..."

"Is this what love is? It's not even funny. I'm a selfish person who only thinks about my own well-being. Everything was because of my selfishness."

Minjoo's gaze slowly turned towards Ryu Min.

In her eyes, there were various indescribable emotions.

"Do I have the right to love you, given what I am?"

"Juri."

"It's disgusting."

"..."

"I'm so disgusted with myself that I can't stand it."

A single tear rolled down Minjoo's eye.

"So, I want to let go. I don't want to love you anymore. I don't have the right to do so."
ChatGPT

Minjoo, who had been stealing tears, forced a bright expression.

"Sorry. I've been talking about depressing things only. This concludes what I wanted to say. Saying it out loud feels refreshing."

"..."

"I'm okay, so don't look at me with those eyes. I had enough time to sort out my thoughts, and this is the result. I'm letting you go. I've just realized that love and friendship are luxuries. So..."

Minjoo stood up.

"There won't be anything bothering you from now on. I'm sorry for everything."

"Minjoo."

Minjoo halted her steps as Ryu Min's low voice reached her.

"Are you really leaving? Won't you regret it?"

"No. I have no regrets about my decision."

"Lies."

Ryu Min stood up and met Minjoo's gaze.

"Do you think I wouldn't know? Even though you're suffering silently inside."

"But it's not true?"

Even though she said that, Ryu Min could see it.

That Minjoo still loved him.

That's why she was trying even harder to let him go.

"Can you live without me?"

"Yes."

"Can you live without seeing me?"

"Yes."

"Look into my eyes and say it."

Minjoo avoided eye contact.

Even without asking, the painful emotions were clearly conveyed.

That's why Ryu Min had no choice.

He couldn't stand seeing Minjoo in pain.

"I'll give you a gift."

"â€¦?"

"Close your eyes and open your mouth."

"What are you talking about?"

Minjoo looked at him suspiciously as he instructed her to do something strange.

"Do you trust me?"

Without hesitation, Minjoo responded as if there was no need for consideration.

"Of course."

"Then, do as I say. It will bring peace to your heart."

"..."

Feeling unsure, Minjoo closed her eyes and slightly opened her mouth as instructed.

Meanwhile, Ryu Min took out a potion from his inventory.

Memory Erase Potion.

'With this, I can erase Minjoo's painful memories.'

Ryu Min uncorked the potion and fed it to Minjoo.

"Ryu... Min?"

As something flowed into her mouth, Minjoo raised her eyelids in surprise.

However, an irresistible drowsiness weighed down her eyelids.

"Ah..."

With the blurry image of Ryu Min as the last thing she saw, Minjoo's consciousness was completely severed.

"Umm..."

Minjoo, opening her eyes, was startled and raised her head.

"When did I fall asleep? I don't remember."

A bitter laugh escaped her as she looked at herself lying on the cafe table.

"I must be the only one who came to a cafe to sleep."

As she chuckled with a sense of disappointment, she looked around and noticed another person besides herself.

It was a young man who appeared to be around her age.

"He wasn't here when I entered the cafe, was he?"

Perhaps he came in while she was sleeping.

Just as she was about to turn her head awkwardly in response to the gaze directed at her.

A question crossed her mind.

"Excuse me, have we met before?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Aren't you a player?"

If he was her age, he should have been a player for sure.

But it felt strange because she had never seen his face before.

However, contrary to her expectations, the man shook his head.

"I'm not a player. Just a regular person."

"A regular person? Are you not in your twenties?"

"I'm 32."

"Oh, I'm sorry. You looked like someone from my generation..."

"It's okay."

"You look quite young. Haha."

The man just stared without responding.

"What did I get on my face?"

Feeling uncomfortable under his gaze, Minjoo stood up from her seat.

"I don't know what I'm doing here, coming to a cafe and taking a nap."

"This isn't the right time for this. I should be spending as much time as possible with Dad, as the next round might be the last."

With such thoughts, Minjoo walked out of the cafe, and Ryu Min watched her back until the end.

And when he was left alone in the quiet cafe, he whispered with a smile.

"Fortunately, it seems like her memories were erased. Now she doesn't have to suffer because of me."

It was a smile that seemed somewhat bitter.

Ryu Min's mood was not good when he returned home.

"Brother? You're ba..."

Thud. Thump.

He entered his room without responding to his younger brother's greeting.

"Sigh..."

A long sigh filled the quiet room.

Well, there was nothing else he could do.
ChatGPT

He erased his friend's memories with his own hands.

"That includes my memories too."

In order to alleviate Minjoo's pain, Ryu Min made a choice.

He chose to erase his own memories with a Memory Erase Potion.

To completely eliminate the existence of Ryu Min from her mind.

"Now that I've removed the cause, she shouldn't suffer anymore."

Having erased the memories, Minjoo wouldn't think of Ryu Min and the Black Scythe as the same person anymore.

No, she wouldn't even know the person named Ryu Min.

The presence of Ryu Min in her life had completely vanished.

However, he didn't erase the memories of the Black Scythe.

"If I had erased the memories of the Black Scythe too, it would have been difficult to proceed with Round 20."

For the strategy, Minjoo's assistance was essential.

The reason he kept Minjoo alive until the final round and didn't erase the memories of the Black Scythe was because of this.

"The memory deletion worked well. It's evident from her reaction earlier. But..."

Was it really a good thing to erase the memories?

Suddenly, a sense of regret crept in.

And so, a self-deprecating smile appeared.

It seemed absurd to have such thoughts after already committing the act.

"It was the right thing to do. Minjoo suffered so much because of me."

If he hadn't erased the memories, she would have undoubtedly suffered greatly, possibly affecting Round 20.

That would have led to dangerous situations.

"There's nothing as risky as facing Round 20 with an unstable mental state."

As it was the final round, he had to be vigilant.

Hadn't he overcome numerous rounds for the sake of survival?

Therefore, Ryu Min didn't regret his decision.

It was the best option to alleviate Minjoo's pain.

"After clearing Round 20, we can live a new life."

Both he and Minjoo.

Each pursuing their own lives.

Although it felt uncomfortable, there was no other choice.

"Sigh."

Despite the frustration, he breathed out a sigh, but the news wasn't entirely gloomy.

This time, the transcendent rune he obtained by emptying his assets and gold brightened Ryu Min's mood.

[Transcendent Rune]

Effect: Removes level limits, and allows gaining experience from all enemies.
