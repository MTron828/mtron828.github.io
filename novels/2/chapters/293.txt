Title: Episode 293 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

Rune Choice

Ryumin, upon receiving the reward, raised an eyebrow.

'I got what I wanted. Rune Choice.'

As the name suggests, it is an item that allows you to choose a rune from among 10 options.

Normally, one would contemplate, as the rune information cannot be previewed, but Ryumin doesn't need to.

Having gone through numerous episodes, he already knows which rune is the best.

'No need to hesitate. Use it.'

Upon immediately using the item, options appear.

[Please touch the desired rune from the following.]

└ 1. Rune of Persuasion

└ 2. Rune of Absorption

└ 3. Rune of the Dark Knight

└ 4. Rune of Swift Light

………………

…………

└ 10. Rune of Truth

Unlike items, runes do not have grades.

Depending on the situation, there are good and bad runes.

Therefore, determining grades is ambiguous and probably non-existent.

'But it's an undeniable fact that there are overwhelmingly good runes.'

For example, the first rune Ryumin obtained, the Rune of Time Reversal, is such.

Can you find a better rune anywhere else?

Perhaps, in terms of grades, it would surpass the God grade and reach the Eternal grade.

'If that's the case, the rune I'm choosing now is probably at least a God-grade.'

With a smile, Ryumin chose a rune.

[You have chosen Rune of Swift Light (No. 4).] [The acquired rune is automatically imprinted on the player's body!] [Rune of Swift Light]

Effect: Can move at swift speed for 3 seconds at will. When moving, there is an effect of perceiving the surroundings as slow. Has a cooldown of 1 hour when used.

'With this, I might be able to stand against Artharos.'

Since he became a god, he confirmed that his rune can also work against gods.

Therefore, the Rune of Swift Light will be quite helpful when facing a god.

Literally, it's a rune for moving at swift speed.

'Even though the cooldown is long, using it like a finishing move for 3 seconds of swift movement will act as a tremendous advantage.'

Three seconds may seem short, but no, it isn't.

Considering the speed, it was the time equivalent to circling the Earth more than twenty times.

Naturally, it was also a rune that made it into the list of 18 essential runes that must be obtained.

The Growth Rune obtained as a reward for reaching the maximum level was the same.

[Growth Rune]

Effect: Converts experience points obtained after defeating enemies into stat points. Accumulates 1 stat point for every 100,000 experience points.

A while ago, Ryumin received experience points as a clear reward.

In numerical terms, it amounted to six million experience points.

However, being at the maximum level and not having gained experience points from defeating enemies, he couldn't convert them into stats.

"It's okay. I plan to dry up the monsters' essence in round 19."

In round 19, there would be plenty of opportunities to defeat monsters.

It would have been quite unfair without the Growth Rune.

"While others may rejoice at a significant level increase, I'm satisfied with just obtaining one rune."

Naturally, one rune is more valuable than the 20 stat points received by leveling up to level 10.

Moreover, considering it as an item, a rune that matches the God grade has been given as a reward, making it even more remarkable.

"Now, shall I choose a special reward?"

Upon immediate use, a message appears.

[You can choose one of the following special rewards.] [Please touch the desired reward.]

└ 1. Temporary Skill - Evasion of Tracking (Limited to Round 19)

└ 2. Infinite Material Pouch

└ 3. Information about Round 19

Judging from the temporary skill, one could speculate that the next round involves a mission related to tracking.

Of course, Ryumin, who knows all the information, didn't need to speculate.

"I don't need to evade tracking in my current state. Just transforming my appearance is enough to avoid tracking."

Therefore, Ryumin chose option 2.

For him, obtaining materials quickly to create Eternal items was more advantageous.

Fluxictos's pupils, who had been breathing heavily, shook in disbelief.

It was the first time he had encountered such a bewildering opponent in his entire existence.

"I, a deity... fleeing from mere humans..."

Of course, outside the Demon Lord's castle, he was nothing more than a demon, not treated as a deity.

Even his giant-like appearance had now diminished to that of a human.

"The appearance doesn't matter. What's important is that I've left the Demon Lord's castle that I've guarded for decades. I've risked my life for it!"

To think that he would flee from humans in such a pathetic manner.

If other demons had witnessed it, they would have been speechless.

Of course, there were no demons left around the Demon Lord's castle, as Fluxictos had cleared them out with his black scythe.

"It's perplexing. I never thought I'd be cornered to this extent by mere humans."

However, what was even more perplexing was something else.

The fact that a being who had no need to save himself had come to his rescue.

[Lord Artharos.]

Where Fluxictos was looking, a pitiful and miserable angel was standing.

"That appearance... Ah, I apologize. What happened to you? Did you really get beaten by that guy...?"

Fluxictos, who was questioning, trailed off.

It was because the murky eyes of Artharos were not casual.

'He's one unpleasant guy.'

Though he cursed with a displeased face, he couldn't help but swallow it internally.

Artharos was a deity quite recognized even among the gods.

He was known for his exceptional skills and abilities, to the point where it was said that no one could match him in battle.

Fluxictos, who was known in the demon realm as someone who could rival such a being, was no match, to say the least.

Compared to Artharos, his strength was like that of a fledgling.

Yet, Artharos, who was known for his silence, saved Fluxictos, who was struggling against a human with a black scythe?

For reasons unknown.

Artharos, who had been silent until then, slowly opened his mouth.

"The opponent was formidable. Tried to kill, but couldn't." "Wha... You mean you really lost to a human...?" "Not a human. Now, a deity."

Fluxictos was startled by those words.
ChatGPT

"W-What are you saying? Are you saying that a human has been promoted to become a deity?"

Artharos's hazy pupils turned towards Fluxictos.

As Fluxictos shook his head in disbelief, he rebuffed, "That's impossible. How can a human become a deity?"

"Have you seen it for yourself? …"

"If he's not a deity, he shouldn't be able to harm us. But he tore through me as if it was nothing."

"That's... unbelievable."

Fluxictos was visibly astonished.

Artharos himself had just admitted that the human with the black scythe cornered him.

"Does that mean that the power of that human surpasses Artharos in strength?"

If he, who is recognized as unmatched in battle among the gods, acknowledges someone as stronger, how powerful must that someone be?

Though Fluxictos was surprised, there was something even more surprising.

"It seems like someone has intervened in the system. Otherwise, such a thing wouldn't happen."

"What? Intervened in the system?"

Unless a specific deity who participated in the development among the gods did it, no one could tamper with the system.

Fluxictos, who considered the situation more serious than he initially thought, couldn't resolve the questions that lingered.

"Come to think of it, why did you save me?"

"Displeased with being saved?"

"No, I'm truly grateful for buying me time to escape. I could have died at the hands of that human. It's infuriatingly humiliating."

"He's not human."

"Ah, well, yes. Anyway, I'm relieved not to have died at his hands, but I still don't understand why you saved me."

"I didn't save you because I wanted to. It was an order from above."

"Above... an order?"

As Artharos nodded, Fluxictos asked again, curious about who gave the order to save him.

Who, in the divine hierarchy, ordered his rescue?

To his surprise, an unexpected answer came back.

"Who? Well, from Him?"

Fluxictos was shocked because Artharos referred to a colossal figure.

Not just any colossal figure, but the god of gods who existed since the beginning.
ChatGPT

"D-Did He take an interest in such trivial matters?" "To you, it may seem like a trivial matter, but for the gods, much is at stake. Watch your words." "I-I apologize."

Reprimanded in a scolding tone, Fluxictos still couldn't conceal his surprise.

To think that a superior who might not even recognize him personally would issue an order to save his life...

"For Him to ask a half-rate deity like me to be protected... This feels surprisingly good." "He didn't ask you to be saved." "What?"

"He simply ordered to prevent the human with the black scythe from causing any more trouble."

"Oh..."

With an expression that indicated disappointment, Fluxictos sighed.

"But you failed to carry out the order. Seeing you return battered and broken from that human with the black scythe..."

"But it was an informative battle. Since I knew a lot about that guy, it's not entirely unprofitable. And while I might have been pushed back, it's not a complete loss."

"You couldn't kill him?"

"Instead, I erased his memories and turned him into a fool."

"Oh, so you did fulfill the order then? A fool with no memories won't be causing any trouble."

"I wish that were true, but..."

Artharos's eyes, like a telescope, looked down upon the black-scythed figure.

"He seems to be prancing around like he owns the place, memory intact."

"What? Oh... I see."

Fluxictos also used the telescope-like ability to gaze down upon the otherworld.

He could see the black scythe figure massacring his own soldiers.

"That damn human dares to harm my subordinates!" "He's not a human; he's a deity."

Artharos spoke in a solemn tone.

"Now, we must treat him as such. You and I." "Me too?"

Fluxictos asked with a puzzled expression.

"I... Why me?"

"There was an order to not be picky about the means and methods for the execution of the operation. In my judgment, you also need to contribute to capturing the black scythe. So, you should assist me." "...If I don't help, I could be reported to Him."

"Oh..."

'Threatening me so blatantly, damn guy.'

Unable to curse out loud, Fluxictos, who had just barely maintained a dignified appearance, quickly let go of his anger.

Since Artharos had proposed an interesting suggestion.
ChatGPT

"On the contrary, if you help me, your merits will be conveyed to Him. I'm sure you understand the significance of that." "Ah...!"

Fluxictos's eyes sparkled.

This was an opportunity.

An opportunity to become a proper deity with achievements, not just a half-rate one.

"I understand what you're saying. I'll help sincerely! What about the plan you had in mind...?" "It's too early for that; it would be better to prepare for Round 19. That would be the optimal timing to target the black scythe."

Artharos, who spoke in this way, showed a faint smile for the first time.
