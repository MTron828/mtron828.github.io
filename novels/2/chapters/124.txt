Title: Episode 124 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max Level Player

Janitor

[Top-Quality Tough Leather] [Category: Item] [Description: Tough and high-quality leather from a top-tier monster. Suitable for crafting items.] [Seller: dontgo95] [Price: 2,000,000 won] [Negotiable: No] [Chat: No] [Transaction Method: Delivery]

Ryumim wore a satisfied smile as she looked at the item posted by Joo Sung-tak.

It was a freshly obtained legendary material.

'She must have killed the eighth-round boss, Ogre, to get this item.'

With a lot of human corpses, she could have easily collected materials without the need for corpse explosions.

If she were alone, she probably wouldn't have been able to defeat Ogre, but either way, it was fortunate for Ryumim that it was taken down.

'Even a psychopathic murderer can be useful at times.'

With such thoughts, she pressed the purchase button.

The ID naturally belonged to Lost Yak, not Ryumim, and the delivery address was set to Lost Yak's one-room apartment.

Ryumim smiled at Joo Sung-tak, who was lying down and only looking at his phone.

'I'll make good use of the legendary material you saved for me. Don't feel bad and just send me a living allowance.'

Being a guy with missing limbs, he wouldn't be able to find a part-time job anywhere.

The sales proceeds would probably go towards his living expenses.

'With this, I only need one more legendary material.'

While pondering whether to make a weapon or a necklace, Ryumim received a call.

It wasn't from Lost Yak's phone but from Ryumim's own phone.

"Hello."

Master, it's me, Kim Ye-dam.

"Yeah. Don't use my real name, just call me Yamti."

Oh, okay.

"Seeing that you called, I assume you've completed what I asked for?"

Yes. I organized the list of PlSeva memberships as instructed and sent it to you by email a while ago.

"Got it. Until further instructions, keep a low profile for a while. Representative Seong-hyun will be actively looking for you with a keen eye."

Understood.

"Control the chairman so that he doesn't get any strange ideas."

Don't worry about it.

"Hey, don't act cute with me. How dare you play around with your owner like that. Tsk."

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I will correct it."

"Okay. Goodbye."

Ryumim closed the call and opened her email.

There was an email from Yamti.

[PlSeva Elimination List.xlsx]

'Why did he save the file with such a name? What if it gets caught?'

Thinking that she would have to raise a fuss later, she opened the file.

A list of players who joined PlSeva appeared.

[Nickname] [Real Name] [Level] [Join Date] [Occupation] [Crime] [Current Status]

Minchojoa / Park Saerom / 20 years old / April 11th / College Student / Aiding Murder / Surviving

Guyeonseung / Gu Yeonseung / 29 years old / April 5th / Actor / Murder / Surviving

ChimaekisTruth / Park Hyunmin / 28 years old / April 11th / Office Worker / Aiding Murder, Rape / Surviving

.................................

...............................

.......................

From nicknames to real names, occupations, crimes committed during the interview, everything was neatly organized.

Yamti, having work experience in the company, seemed to handle such matters well.

'So many trash to deal with?'

Exactly 1,031 individuals.

The number was sigh-worthy.

'I can't run a cafe with these guys.'

PlSeva's current direction was different from before.

Interviews were conducted based solely on personality, unrelated to skills, and those with criminal records were unconditionally rejected.

It was different from the past when they accepted anyone regardless of being a criminal.

Though they were undergoing a transition, the existing members were a problem.

'I can't forcefully kick out those who have already joined.'

Forcing them out might lead to unpredictable consequences outside.

Releasing criminals who were once confined to prison back into society was a serious matter.

'So, for now, it's appropriate to make a list like this and gradually organize them.'

To put it nicely, it's organization; to put it harshly, it's purging.

'First, I need someone to take care of this trash.'

Handling such a large-scale trash cleanup requires an expert.

Fortunately, a garbage cleaner popped up in her mind.

'Why not go ask for a favor?'

Ryumim's lips twisted into a smirk.

A shabby warehouse.

There, five players gathered, smoking cigarettes.

"Sigh, damn it. How did we end up like this?"

"Yeah, it's ridiculous."

Along with the smoke, sighs and curses naturally flowed from their mouths.

It wasn't for no reason; in front of them was a wanted poster.

A wanted poster with their faces on it.

"Damn it, someone put up a damn picture."

"I wouldn't look this ugly."

"No, you look damn ugly. Completely messed up."

"Hey, damn it, don't you have a mirror at home? Spitting while lying down, idiot."

Even while laughing, another sigh escaped.

They were laughing to ease the tension, but deep down, they were aware of the seriousness of the situation.

"We're wanted, can't move freely. What the hell is this?"

"You should get plastic surgery or something."

"What plastic surgery, damn it. If they use tracking skills, getting caught is just a matter of time."

"Oh, right. Damn it. That thing. We had that."

As if making a promise, smoke and sighs flowed along with the cigarette from the mouths of the five.

"I heard Representative Seonghyun proposed a bill. Creating a major player organization."

"Then it'll be damn easy for them to find us with tracking skills?"

"It seems we'll end up living a fugitive life, damn it."

"Damn it, could we avoid tracking by changing our names?"

How did they, as players, end up becoming wanted criminals?

Thinking about it with sighs, there was only one cause.

"It's all because we joined that cafe."

"Yeah, because we committed murder for the first time there..."

Players change the world.

While many liked the phrase and joined, there would be no one who joined to commit murder.

"Those damn guys set a trap for us."

That's right. We fell into a trap.

If they hadn't been coerced into committing murder but had chosen it willingly, things wouldn't have reached this point.

"Hey, but honestly, it was enjoyable back then."

"Well..."

"Hehe, ah. Thinking about it now, really..."

Some showed ecstatic expressions on their faces.

When they heard the phrase that to join the cafe, they had to kill someone, they were all shocked.

Thinking, "Are there all kinds of cafes like this?"

However, the world operates strictly through power.

Players survive, and ordinary people will fade away.

Currently, in the eyes of players, ordinary people are nothing more than livestock.

Do you want to live a life ignored by such beings?

Listening to the logic that says you must show the fear of players to ordinary people made some sense.

Moreover, after going through the 4th round, there was no reluctance to kill people.

Even if they all had a red-marked history.

"Still, I've never committed murder or rape in real life."

"Me neither."

"But it wasn't as bad as I thought. Hehe."

Others nodded in agreement, smirking as if they found it amusing.

Though they became fugitives, the memories of their first murder weren't as bad as expected.

Some even seemed to bounce their hips as if reminiscing about the time they collectively raped that woman.

"Wait, but it's not just us who are wanted, right?"

"It shouldn't be. Everyone who joined the cafe either committed murder like us or aided it, right?"

"Then, we didn't need to be so nervous, right?"

The five of them found some comfort.

Thinking there were thousands of comrades on the same boat, their hearts calmed.

If things got tough, they could snitch to the police and sink the ship.

"That's probably why the cafe manager called us. To send us to another country."

They received the same message from the PlSeva manager today.

[Player, I'm the cafe manager, 'Chairman.' An investigation has begun regarding the murder committed during the April 8th interview. I apologize, but you must escape to another country. We will cover all expenses related to this. For more details, please come to the location marked on the map by 23:00...]

"Now I somewhat understand. They urgently called us because if we report them, the chairman will be in trouble too."

"Huh, suddenly having to escape to another country."

"Well, how do they plan to go? Did they arrange a smuggling ship or something?"

They were told there was no need to bring luggage, and, in their desperation, they didn't even think about it.

"I'm living abroad for the first time in my life."

"Escaping from Hell Joseon; it worked out well, damn it."

Although they used to curse at the fictional date, when it came time to leave, they felt a bit sentimental about South Korea.

"There's no better country for criminals to live in than here..."

"That's an old saying, damn it. It's all messed up now because of Representative Seonghyun in the National Assembly."

Once again, the players took out fresh cigarettes and sighed.

"But when is the chairman coming?"

"Yeah, the agreed-upon time is almost up."

"What if the person who regrets the most comes last? Damn it."

"Maybe we should just blow the whistle to the police."

At that moment, when dissatisfaction was reaching its peak—

Drdrdrdrdr—

The warehouse door opened, and a man appeared.

"Is it the chairman?"

They didn't know the chairman's face, but it was the only logical conclusion as he appeared exactly at the agreed-upon time.

Thud!

The man who closed the warehouse door looked at the players in silence.

Though he had a neat appearance, there was something mysterious about his atmosphere.

"Are you the chairman?"

"..."

"Hey, is it true that you're sending us overseas?"

"..."

"And are you providing all the funds for living abroad?"

"..."

"Is everything really problem-free?"

They threw questions, but all they got in return was silence.

"Hey, damn it, say something. This mess happened because of you..."

"These trash are blaming others."

"What?"

"Fine. I'll send you."

At that statement, the players saw it.

The man's entire body being instantly equipped with gear.

The sight of a black energy-filled sword being gripped in his hand.

Tsutsutsu—

"I'll send you. To hell."

Ma Kyung-rok's sword danced.

With the sound of slicing, limbs flew around.

"Aaah!"

"Ack! This crazy bastard!"

In an instant, the scene was filled with screams and blood.

There was nowhere to escape.

In just 10 seconds, the five lost their limbs.

"Don't worry. I won't kill you yet. Until I spit out the item."

Dark Aura flowed from Ma Kyung-rok's sword like a snake.

"Eat them. Don't kill them."

At that command, Dark Aura, like a living entity, attacked the players.

Crunching sounds!

"Screaaaam!"

A wicked smile appeared on Ma Kyung-rok's face.
