Title: Episode 318 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Triceps Use

"Ah, I understand. Master."

Yamti followed the master's words without any hesitation.

Thunk-

While facing the demons with a staff, the max-level skill [Boss Taming] was attempted.

However, Yamti soon turned her head with a disappointed expression.

"Master, a message is popping up saying the target is incorrect."

"Not a monster, then?"

He had guessed, but it still wasn't working?

A little disappointed, but there was an alternative.

Did he bring John Delgado for nothing?

"Well, I have no choice. I can only kill them and use them as slaves through necromancy. John."

"Yes."

"With your ability, how many undead can you create?"

"As I reached max level and enhanced my ability, there is no limit to the number... but... I think we need to test it."

"Alright. I'll kill these guys, so make them all part of our family. If you can't tame them, then turn them into undead."

"Leave it to me."

He had already proven through Sariel that he could make an Archangel a part of his family.

So, he should be able to turn demons into his family by killing them.

When Ryu Min looked at them with a fierce gaze, the demon aristocrats who understood his intentions were taken aback.

[Oh, my lord. P-Please, don't turn us into Aaahh!]

The first to die was Bifron, ranked 10th.

"First, let's make this guy part of the family."

"Understood. Rise."

John Delgado immediately resurrected Bifron as an undead.

Although 50% of the original ability had decreased, he could certainly make him a part of the family.

"It's working well. Next..."

[My lord! Y-You shouldn't do this!] [Please release us from this resentment... Ugh!]

Ryu Min mercilessly cut down two demons.

"I told you not to use historical language."

"Should I turn the demons I just killed into undead too?"

"Yeah, give it a try."

Upon receiving the order, John Delgado raised the demons once again.

This time, it was also a success.

For the demons, the sight of corpses remaining and only their souls rising and taking shape was terrifying beyond imagination.

[Oh, my lord! We made a mistake!] [We don't want to die! Please spare us!]

"I'm sorry. There's no other way but to use you to your fullest extent."

Despite the apology, Ryu Min's scythe showed no mercy.

The demons, helpless and unable to resist, were pitiful to the point of being heartbreaking as they were swiftly beheaded.

"Master, I have made up to eight of them part of our family with this."

Upon John Delgado's report, Ryu Min looked at the two remaining demons.

Sietri, ranked first, and Botis, ranked second, were still alive.

"Sietri, you don't need to tremble since I won't kill you. You can move to another realm without being killed, right?"

[Th-Thank you.]

"On the other hand..."

Ryu Min's gaze fell on Botis.

"Since I can't take you with me, I have no choice but to make you a subordinate through necromancy."

"W-Wait, wait a moment, My Lord."

Sensing the threat to his life, Botis hastily spoke up.

"If you're looking for soldiers to take to another realm, there's Cerberus over there. Since he's a beast, he's treated as a monster, so you can tame him..."

"Cerberus is weak. What use is there in taming that? It's better to just kill you and make you a subordinate. As a high-ranking demon, you should be stronger than Cerberus, right?"

As Ryu Min poised his scythe, Botis's desperation became evident.

"W-Wait! There's a dragon! A three-headed dragon!"

"What dragon?"

"A three-headed dragon! It's the most formidable monster in the demon realm. Tame that instead of me!"

A three-headed dragon was a monster Ryu Min hadn't heard of before.

Even as the ruler of the demon realm, there were things he didn't know.

"Where is this creature?"

"I will guide you. Please spare my life. I beg you..."

With a sincere tone, Ryu Min nodded.

"Fine. Lead the way to where the three-headed dragon is, and I'll spare your life."

"Thank you! Thank you!"

"Alright, hurry up and take the lead. We don't have much time."

After about 20 minutes of following Botis, they arrived at a large cave.

Even Ryu Min was slightly surprised at its size, comparable to a dragon's lair.

"Is it inside there?"

[Yes. The three-headed dragon is inside there.]
ChatGPT

"How strong is the three-headed dragon?"

[Well, I'm not sure. I've only heard rumors, but one thing is certain – among the monsters in the demon realm, it's considered unbeatable.]

"Let's go in and see for ourselves. Lead the way."

[Yes...]

Ryu Min and his party moved forward following Botis.

As soon as they entered the cave, a mournful howl echoed.

"Krrrrrr."

A displeased voice, as if it had already sensed the presence of intruders.

Sure enough, as they ventured deeper, three pairs of yellow eyes gleamed in the darkness.

It was the three-headed dragon.

"Kraaaaaa!"

True to its name, the creature had three heads on one body, and it was about the size of a dragon, albeit lacking the imposing aura due to bat-like wings.

"Is this the one?"

[Yes, my lord.]

"Go ahead and deal with it. Let's see how formidable it is. Oh, and since we're going to tame it, don't inflict any wounds."

[Yes, my lord.]

Now forced to confront the three-headed dragon, Botis stepped forward, provoking the creature.

"Come on! You snake-headed brat!"

"Kraaaaah!"

As if properly provoked, flames spewed from the three-headed dragon's mouth.

Fwoosh—

Although Botis dodged the attack lightly, it wasn't the end.

"Huh?"

As frost emanated from another head, Botis fluttered his wings in surprise.

However.

Thud—!

As if anticipating an attempt to escape, another head bit Botis's ankle.

Crunch—!

"Khaaah!"

With the severed ankle, Botis fell to the ground.

"Cutting the ankle of a demon aristocrat. The strength is quite impressive."

Ryu Min watched leisurely with his fists clenched as Botis and the three-headed dragon fought.

Well, to call it a fight was misleading – it was rather one-sided.

One side launched various attacks with three heads, while the other side, forbidden from retaliating, frantically tried to escape.

"Kra-ro-ro-ro!"

[Kryuh.]

The wings of the fleeing Botis caught fire.

It seemed like a struggle for Botis, facing a three-to-one disadvantage.

'A monster that overwhelms a demon aristocrat like this. Not bad.'
ChatGPT

Satisfied with a smile, Ryu Min stepped forward as if to signify that it was his turn.

"Come back. I'll be the one to deal with it now."

[Th-Thank you. Haa, haa...]

Having switched with Botis, Ryu Min approached the three-headed dragon with slow steps.

"Krrrrrr."

The creature, as if about to charge, hesitated upon seeing Ryu Min and took a step back.

'Is it because of the Dragon Slayer title?'

The recent display confirmed that it was indeed a monster.

"Yamti, tame it."

"Yes, Master."

Yamti aimed her staff and used the max-level skill [Boss Taming], producing a markedly different reaction than when used on demons.

"Grrrrr-"

The three-headed dragon, instead of lowering its head toward Yamti, showed signs of a lively gaze.

"It looks like it succeeded."

"Yes! It has been tamed!"

"At this level, it should be useful as a summon."

Considering its capabilities, it was not a bad choice as a summoned creature.

While Yamti happily released the three-headed dragon, Botis approached.

"Um, w-will you spare me now?"

"Spare you? Who?"

Seeing Ryu Min, the Demon Lord, in his intimidating form, Botis jumped in surprise.

"Haven't we made a promise?"

"Such promises don't exist in the human world."

Before Ryu Min could finish his sentence, he swung his scythe.

Botis's head rolled on the ground.

"A promise is meant to be broken."

[...]
Watching this cruelty, Sietri, who had been observing, wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead.

"John, make this one a subordinate too."

"Yes, Master."

In 30 minutes, Ryu Min had turned nine demon aristocrats into his subordinates, including the three-headed dragon.

Having achieved his goal, Ryu Min called his subordinates together.

"Shall we go now? Sietri, you'll be called in the 20th round, so get ready."

[Yes, My Lord.]

When Sietri, with a graceful bow, stood up.

The three humans who had been there disappeared already.

July 31, 2023, 11:30 PM.

30 minutes before the start of the final 20th round.

72 players awaited entry into the otherworld from their respective safe locations.

They were too tense to sleep.

Perhaps that's why time seemed to pass slowly.
ChatGPT

Some spent their time lying on their beds, indulging in pleasant fantasies.

"With the Black Scythe here, we'll definitely clear the last round, right?"

"After the strategy, what wish should I make? Should I ask to become rich?"

"Rather than money, asking for power would be better, don't you think?"

While people spent their solitary time unfolding various imaginative scenarios, Ryu Min was not alone.

He was with Ryu Won.

It could possibly be the last round.

A round where, every second, he wanted to be with his family.

"If I don't wake up even after three hours, consider me dead."

"W-Why would you say that! Why would my brother die?"

"Even monkeys fall from trees. I'm no exception as a human being."

"Don't say such ominous things! You're practically the protagonist of a novel – who dies?"

"Have you never read a novel where the protagonist dies?"

Ryu Min didn't always say pleasant things to his younger brother.

He didn't tell white lies.

He only spoke the truth, even considering the worst-case scenarios.

Perhaps that's why his brother, though jumping and shouting, couldn't deny the truth.

"Cancel what you just said! Promise you'll come back alive!"

"I'm sorry, but making such a promise might be difficult. I don't know what boss will appear in the 20th round."

Of course, regardless of which boss appeared, Ryu Min was confident he would crush it.

Even if Arthas appeared, he didn't entertain the thought of losing.

Compared to when he fought that guy, he had become several times stronger now.

"Time has already passed like this."

"Brother..."

"Don't cry. Am I going to die?"

"You're the one who made me anxious!"

"That's what the words say. Don't worry too much. Trust your brother."

Seeing Ryu Min smile, Ryu Won wiped away tears.

"Will you come back alive?"

"I can't guarantee, but... yeah, I'll come back."

"Really? You promised?"

"Sigh, okay, I got it."

Ryu Min, who had comforted his brother, checked the time.

"Now we really don't have time."

"Lie down on the bed."

"Sure."

As always, Ryu Min entered his own room and lay down on the bed, with his worried brother looking at him.

"I'll come back alive."

With those words, Ryu Min's consciousness soared into the otherworld.
