Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player, Episode 191"

The 12 Apostles

Despairism is not an official religion.

It wasn't well-known even in the United States because it was considered a cult.

It was natural for John Delgado to have doubts.

"How did you find me?"

His tone towards Spaniard was more polite.

He felt the need to be careful in his speech after hearing that he was the founder of the Messiah.

Not only because he thought of him as a colleague who rode the ship of the one who would wield the black scythe, but also because he heard that he was a believer of Despairism.

"While investigating the top player in the United States, I encountered someone who knows your real face, sir. He was a follower of Despairism. Thanks to him, I was able to trace your location."

"Selling my face without permission. What kind of rat..."

"His nickname is Berberado."

"Berberado?"

John's mouth opened wide in disbelief.

This guy was one of his loyal subordinates, trusted more than anyone else.

"Don't say too much. He didn't betray you. He provided the information because he knew it was a proposal you would like."

"Damn, that guy. I'll have to scold him later."

"Oh, we're here."

John, who had been grumbling, got out of the car with Spaniard at the mention of arrival.

The place they arrived at was a secluded forest.

"Let's go. We have to go quite deep."

After about 30 minutes of walking through the forest, they saw a small cabin.

"Is this where the meeting is supposed to be?"

"Yes."

"There are many other places like cafes. Why here..."

"It's a gathering place for top-level players. It's better not to attract attention, right? There might be fights due to differences of opinion if we're not careful."

"Well, it might get noisy if we clash swords using skills."

Especially since it was their first meeting, they had to be extra cautious about what might happen.

"Are all the top players from each country gathered inside?"

"Yes. Three days ago, after recruiting you, sir, the recruitment of the 12 Apostles was completed. However, not everyone could attend. Some countries are difficult to reach due to various reasons."

As Spaniard was explaining, he opened the cabin door.

Creak-

In front of the arranged wooden table, six people were sitting with bored expressions. They were top-level players from various countries, each with different hair colors and races.

"How long are you going to make us wait, Spaniard? Do you want us to die of boredom?"

"Haha, sorry for keeping you waiting."

"Is that the last Apostle?"

"Yes, everyone, please greet him. This is John Delgado, the top player in the United States and the leader of Despairism."

As Spaniard introduced him, the attention of the people turned to John.

Swoosh-

The first to stand up was a man with a physique that seemed to exceed 2 meters.

"I've heard the introduction. Nice to meet you. I'm the First Warrior."

John, shaking hands with the extended hand, furrowed his brow.

He couldn't help but think that the hand was disgustingly large.

"Judging by your pronunciation, are you British?"

"Yes. I'm also a Sword Master who ranked 5th in this round."

"5th, impressive. Did you earn a lot of points?"

"Even if I did, it's like a drop in the ocean compared to the Black Scythe."

After the greetings, the next person stood up and extended his hand.

"I'm the representative from India, Swingman. A level 49 unarmed combatant."

"Nice to meet you."

"I heard you have the ability to raise corpses."

"Yes."

"If you ever need corpses, come to our country. The things rotting in our country are corpses."

John chuckled and shook hands with the next person.

The next person had a gaming addict-like appearance and was of Asian descent.

"I'm Darksoul from Japan, a sniper."

"I didn't know there was a profession called sniper."

"I've never seen a Sorcerer either."

"Where did you learn English?"

"I didn't learn, just self-taught while watching mid-series. But I can't have long conversations."

With nationalities including the UK, India, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, etc., communication was limited to simple English since everyone had different native languages.

"Nice to meet you."

"Welcome, sir."

Most of them shook hands with John, but one person remained quiet.

'What's with that guy?'

Like he had no intention of greeting, the Asian man sat with crossed arms.

"Mr. Yang Chwen, from now on, we'll be working together, so let's exchange greetings."
ChatGPT

"Why me?"

Spaniard had a puzzled expression at the arrogant attitude of the Chinese individual.

"Who is that person?"

"He is Mr. Yang Chwen, ranked 2nd in the 11th round. He belongs to the top rankers in China and holds the first position in the Black Society hierarchy."

'Black Society?'

John couldn't be unaware of organizations notorious worldwide, like the Mafia or the Yakuza.

It was just absurd to see someone with an attitude as if committing crimes was a virtue.

"What are you looking at? You snotty brat."

"What did you say? If you have something to say, say it in English."

Even though he could speak English, he didn't like the sight of someone muttering in Chinese.

"Sir John, please greet the remaining Apostles here. Even though they couldn't be present physically, they've connected through video chat."

On the laptop on the table, the faces of four people were displayed.

After exchanging greetings, Spaniard summarized.

"Well, it seems like the introductions are done. Let's take our seats. Shall we discuss matters more formally now?"

Suppressing some odd feelings, John took his seat.

Eight formidable individuals from different nationalities gathered around one table.

"As a new member, let me introduce myself. I am Spaniard, a level 50 Gladiator from Spain. As you may know, I am the founder of the Messiah, and I believe you are all familiar with the reasons for its establishment."

"To oppose the Black Scythe, right?"

Spaniard nodded in agreement with John's statement.

"Yes, exactly. We have gathered here to oppose the Black Scythe, who holds the top rank. We can no longer ignore his unilateral actions. Alone, we cannot stop him, but together, we might have a chance."

"How do you plan to stop him?"

"Isn't that why we've gathered here to discuss?"

"It's not something to think about vaguely. You saw it this time too. He earned a whopping 20 million points."

"Yes. Undoubtedly, he must have leveled up tremendously with experience point packs and armed himself with items from the Special Shop."

"He might have even reached the maximum level."

Various speculations were thrown around, but the consensus was clear â€“ they needed to stop the Black Scythe.
ChatGPT

"If anyone has a good suggestion on how to stop the Black Scythe, please speak without hesitation," Spaniard said.

One person immediately raised their hand; it was Yang Chwen from China.

"Why bother with all this thinking? Just go to Korea and kill the Black Scythe."

"Kill him? Isn't that too hasty of a decision?"

"Hasty? What's hasty about it? Should we just watch him monopolize the rewards?"

Yang Chwen showed determined eyes full of vitality.

"He needs to be killed. There's no choice but to kill him. Hesitating will only result in losing everything."

"I agree."

John quietly expressed his agreement. Though he didn't like the Chinese individual, he concurred with the opinion of mercilessly killing.

"Indeed, it seems like the Black Scythe is monopolizing the rewards."

"Balance of power should be evenly distributed for all to survive together, right?"

"Yes, if the Black Scythe continues to monopolize, it disrupts the balance. It's like killing other players."

"I agree."

"I also support the opinion of killing him."

Most raised their hands in favor of assassinating the Black Scythe.

There was no need for a formal vote, but Spaniard asked nominally.

"Shall we take a simple vote then? Is there anyone opposed to killing the Black Scythe? Please raise your hand."

"...."

"...."

As expected, no one raised their hand.

"Well, then it's unanimous that you all support killing the Black Scythe. Let's discuss the assassination method. Please feel free to suggest how to find and kill him."

As if waiting for it, the Japanese player, Darksoul, raised his hand.

"I am a sniper. If we secure his location, I can shoot him and kill him even from a distance of 2 km. This ability helped me rank 3rd in the 11th round."

"Oh, truly an occupation optimized for assassination."

"Humph, doesn't matter in my jurisdiction."

Yang Chwen, who sneered in Chinese, spoke in English.

"I am a hunter. Whether it's in reality or in the other world, I'm a professional at killing humans. It will take me two days to track and kill him once I have his location."

"Why did someone as skilled as you join the Messiah? You could handle the Black Scythe on your own," Swingman grumbled, causing Yang Chwen's forehead to scrunch up like a piece of paper.

"Why did a damn weak-looking guy like you come here? Did you eat curry with Karina? Why are you here?" Yang Chwen retorted.

"Doesn't anyone here know Chinese? It sounds like swearing; please interpret what he's saying."

"Enough, please."

The one who quieted the crowd was none other than John.

"Has anyone here personally met the Black Scythe?"

When everyone fell silent, John solemnly spoke.

"I have. Just three days ago, I had my limbs severed by him in the other world."

"..."

"Do you know what emotion I felt at that moment? It was helplessness. The gap in power between him and me was immeasurable. The 30 undead creatures I summoned couldn't even make a single cut; they were obliterated."

As the emotions of that moment resurfaced, John's eyes trembled.

The emotion he felt wasn't fear; it was nothing but anger.

"It's clear he's a formidable foe. However, we cannot let this continue. Even if we have to mobilize all the forces of Despairism, we will defeat that bastard. The tiger does its best when catching a rabbit. So, don't go on about who should take the lead. We need to attack together to stand a chance."

"But it's a surprise attack..."

"No matter how surprising, it won't be easy. He's not someone who casually reached level 90. He might already be at level 99. We must not underestimate him."

John's words carried conviction.

It was the most realistic among the words heard so far, enough to move the hearts of the 12 Apostles towards cooperation.

"Sir John is right. We are here to join forces, not to boast about our abilities. It seems appropriate for us to cooperate."

As the founder, Spaniard said so, the rest of the members had no choice but to nod in agreement.

"Well, let's go to Korea together and plan the execution. First, we need to discuss how to find the Black Scythe."

"I have an idea about that."
ChatGPT

Everyone turned their ears to Darksoul's words.

Seemingly impressed by the quite reasonable plan, everyone's expressions brightened.

"That sounds good."

"I agree."

"Let's move forward with the execution right away."

"Since external actions could be problematic, let's start by finding a smuggling route to Korea."

"Let's do it."

A sinister smile spread across the lips of the 12 Apostles.

Under the arrangement of Ma Kyung-rok, Ryu Min met with Christine.

There wasn't much to discuss in their meeting.

'It was all just as I heard from Jeffrey.'

When asked if she wanted to know the location of the Black Scythe, she subtly shook her head, providing a prepared response.

She knew nothing.

Although she had seen him in the future, she claimed not to know his true identity or location.

He definitely prefers to keep his identity secret. Otherwise, he wouldn't have worn a mask. If you try to find him, he won't like it.

Is that so?

Surprisingly, there was an instant understanding.

'Kristin knew as well. She only acted to investigate the Black Scythe for her father.'

However, Christine's desire to know the Sorcerer's whereabouts was genuine.

There were too many sacrificed comrades to let the emotions of revenge remain buried.

Of course, Ryu Min did not provide her with any information, except for the prophecy about the 12th round.

'Revenge is a luxury for Christine. I can't let her get into danger again.'

A week had passed since returning.

The Sorcerer Christine was looking for would likely have already joined the Messiah.

'After experiencing what the Messiah is, she should know well.'

An international cooperation organization created to counter him, the Black Scythe.

The organization, composed of strong individuals from each country under the name of the 12 Apostles, would enter Korea soon to assassinate him.

'There's about a week left until they start their actions.'

I don't know the exact time.

The time for assassination changes slightly with each round.

However, their approach remains the same every time.

'This time, they will undoubtedly target CPF members.'

The intention is to contact a CPF member to lure the Black Scythe, the leader, into a trap.
ChatGPT

During that process, there were sacrifices among the unit members...

'I don't plan to fall victim this time either.'

Since there might be unforeseen variables, preparations need to be made in advance.

It refers to preparing for the welcoming of foreigners.
