Title: "Episode 158 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max Level Player"

Akashic Record

As soon as Bayel arrived on the ground, he looked around.

[Did the signal come from here?]

The place he arrived at was the most secretive place in the Holy Empire, the Secret Joint.

It was the altar where the covenant was made.

Kallen, who had been crouching on the ground, lifted his head in reflection under the momentum of Ryumin.

[M-Mighty Battle Angel!]

Bayel frowned as he looked at Kallen, who ran up and attached his wings.

[Did you send a distress signal?] [Y-Yes!]

Thud!

Bayel pushed Kallen, who clung to him with his wings.

[Don't get too close because it's unpleasant. Being captured by humans is a bothersome hassle.] [I-I apologize.]

Kallen could only bow his head.

Heavenly realms are a vertically divided society.

Just calling for help from a 9th rank to a 6th rank was already quite noticeable.

It was like a private calling a sergeant in the human world.

[Tsk tsk, it's quite pathetic to be caught by a mere human. Really troublesome.] [I-I have no excuse....] [It's okay.] [Huh?]

Bayel smiled slyly.

[Thanks to you, I can have fun with humans. I was already bored to death.]

Bayel's gaze shifted to the center of the joint.

There, a human stood holding a scythe.

[Is that human?] [Y-Yes, yes! That's right. Just mess him up a bit, please!] [Just with that? I should pull out his organs while he's still alive and wrap them around his neck, hehehe.]

Bayel, who let out a eerie laugh, was already looking forward to it.

Thinking about the screams of the suffering human, the blood, and the organs, he felt good.

Sleep had long since departed.

"Let's have some fun chopping off limbs one by one."

"If you're not at least level 99, you're not worth dealing with."

Despite maintaining an atmosphere, he doesn't seem that strong.

Srrung-

Bayel, who folded his wings, drew the sword at his waist.

Soon, a golden divine power emanated from the sword, the [Sacred Aura], a combat angel skill capable of cutting through steel like tofu.

"Hey, human. Isn't life boring for you?"

"..."

"You're messing with an angel without even understanding the subject. I guess I can take it as you want to die right away?"

Instead of answering, Ryumin took out four potions from his inventory.

These were intermediate potions of strength, agility, intelligence, and luck received from Victor this time.

With the command 'Use,' the contents of the potion seeped into Ryumin's mouth.

Although there was no change in taste or sensation, the message revealed everything.

[Strength increases by 8 for 24 hours.] [Agility increases by 8 for 24 hours.] [Intelligence increases by 8 for 24 hours.] [Luck increases by 8 for 24 hours.]

All stats increased.

Plop-

Somewhere, it seemed like the strings of reason were being cut.

It appeared that Bayel was shivering with anger.

"How dare you suck potions in front of me..."

It seemed like he was irritated by Ryumin's carefree attitude.

A sigh involuntarily escaped Ryumin's lips.

"Just a sigh?"

Ryumin tapped his own head lightly.

"Anyway, these angel brats have a problem with their heads."

"What?"

"What kind of brainwashing education did they receive in heaven to look down on humans like this? Seriously, did they undergo some kind of indoctrination?"

"..."

Looking ridiculous, Bayel lifted the sword as if he was no longer worth talking to.

Determined to use his special skill, the joyful sword, to cut off each of the guy's limbs.

"After that, I'll tear the skin, take out the organs one by one, and show them to you."

He didn't plan to kill him cleanly.

After meticulously dismembering the limbs to cause maximum pain, he intended to slowly play with him while enjoying the screams like music.

"Human, regret meeting me even in death..."

Bayel, who was about to swing his sword, paused.

At some point, the human's body became transparent, and a black aura flowed out, enveloping the entire figure. It looked as if surrounded by black smoke, with the face not even visible.

"What's that?"

Even as a reaper, he was puzzled because he didn't know much about the player.

"The atmosphere doesn't seem friendly."

Feeling an instinctive sense of danger, Bayel quickly closed the distance.

In times like this, taking the initiative is the answer.

Swish-swish-swish-swish-swish!

The joyous sword imbued with the sacred aura embroidered darkness like rays of light.

But there was no sensation of the sword touching.

Bayel's pupils widened after that.

"He dodged them all?"

In just about two seconds, he aimed for the upper part with six stabs, but the target dodged them all.

"It must be a coincidence. It must be. It has to be."

He felt that he needed to confirm it once again.

With a golden trace left at the tip of Bayel's sword, it moved.

Swish-swish-swish-swish! Swish-swish-swish-swish!

"I-Is he dodging them again this time?"

Even though he was confident that his speed surpassed that of a 5th rank angel, why?

Why couldn't he hit the black figure in front of him?

"Do you really not know why?"

"What?"

"It's simple."

Ryumin's scythe flashed diagonally.

"I'm faster than you."

Thunk.

Bayel, who missed the sword, kneeled.

"Kuk, kugh...."

His chest was torn open, and golden blood flowed endlessly.

Splat.

In just one strike.

There was no need for more than that to bring down a 6th rank angel.

Incredible disbelief filled Kallen's face.

"The, the battle angel can't do anything and just dies..."

Kallen knew that a battle angel should be able to handle at least a level 99 player, even if they were not particularly strong.

But to see such a being being defeated so absurdly.

"That human, could he really be at level 99?"

Kallen immediately shook his head to correct his thoughts.

"No, that's impossible. In the 10 rounds reached so far, a player reaching max level has never happened in history."

"Hey."

"...Yes?"

Kallen replied in a polite tone without realizing it.

"Bring more."

"M-More?"

"Yeah, if you don't want to die soon. My body is itching, and I'll die if I don't scratch it."

"Ah... Yes."

Kallen sent another distress signal as ordered, along with a message emphasizing the need for as many reinforcements as possible.

"This time, please kill that human bastard!"

He waited with such earnestness, and after a while, reinforcements appeared. There were five 6th rank battle angels.

Kallen's face turned pale as if to say, "When did this happen?"

"Good! With this many, we can surely kill that arrogant human..."

[Screams!] [Cough, hahaha!] [Aaaah!]

Unexpected screams made Kallen grimace. He couldn't see how many times the scythe swung.

Only the angels, covered in golden blood, fell miserably.

"Are you kidding? Call for someone stronger. Quickly."

At Ryumin's words, Kallen swallowed hard.

Now that he looked, he wasn't an ordinary strong human.

Akashic Record.

An otherworldly collection of information where everything in the universe is recorded.

One of the angels opened the door of the massive library. Normally, anyone couldn't enter, but he had the qualifications.

After all, he was known as one of the seven Archangels.

"Lord Remiel, have you come?" [Rubahii.]

Rubahii was a celestial being managing and guarding the Akashic Record, akin to a librarian.

Thud-

After the door closed, Remiel spread his wings and flew to the center. The infinite library, filled with records of the entire universe, was a good place for Remiel to pass the time.

"Did you come to peek at the records of another world again, Lord Remiel?" [Yes. Do you have any recommended stories?] [There is one interesting story.]

Before Rubahii's words finished, a book floated down mysteriously.

"It's a story you might find intriguing." [Really? Let me see what you've got.]

Remiel smiled as he checked the title of the book. "Hmm? A record about someone called the 'Black Reaper'..."

Even though he didn't know who it was, he turned the pages, and soon he could identify the individual.
ChatGPT

"Is this person currently participating in a survival game on Earth?" [Yes.] "What's interesting about the story of such a human?" [Read a bit more. You'll surely find it intriguing.]

Knowing that Rubahii's words were never wrong, Remiel sighed and turned to the next page. Soon, his eyes widened in surprise.

"Remarkable human. It hasn't even been 10 rounds, and he's already level 89. At this point, players are unlikely to have reached the master level."

"Not only that. Keep reading."

As Remiel read the recorded story in the book, he continued to express admiration.

"He maintained the top spot in every area from Round 1 until now. And what's this? He altered the records of the Akashic Record twice?"

The book had inscriptions in golden runes stating a record of a 1-second time attack and clearing Trial Tower's 99th floor.

"I've seen numerous humans, but this is the first time I've encountered one like this." "See? I told you it would catch your interest."

Indeed, it was intriguing.

However, it was only a bit interesting.

With just this, it wasn't enough to captivate Remiel's attention.

"If this is the end, it's a bit disappointing. He's undoubtedly an interesting human, but the story lacks excitement."

With a flutter, Remiel turned to the next page.

The actions and growth of the Black Reaper were meticulously recorded, but he quickly flipped past it without dwelling too much.

"Looking at it roughly, he has already reached level 89 with an extraordinary growth rate. If things continue like this, he seems to be a strong candidate to fulfill the wish of Round 20."

"Despite your words, it looks interesting, doesn't it?" "Hardly. Whether the results of a survival game favor him or not, I have no reason to be interested. Rubahii, you know my preferences, don't you? I'm more interested in goblin and human female copulation than such humans."

"I know. But would you like to turn the last page?" "No need to see it."

Encouraged again, Remiel pretended to give in and turned the page.

"Hmm?"

Eventually, Remiel furrowed his brows as if saying he had seen something unbearable.

"What's this? He killed 15 battle angels?" "Yes. He's the only player who wielded a sword against angels."

"Huh, a common human boasting like this. It's ridiculous."
ChatGPT

At that moment, new words appeared on the page Remiel was holding.

[Just added another angel.] [Are they currently engaging in real-time combat?] [It seems so.]

His forces were currently being killed off?

By mere humans?

He didn't know because he was inside the Akashic Record. Here, connections with other worlds were blocked.

"Haha, truly an interesting human."

Rather than anger, he felt interest.

Daring to kill an angel.

Considering the possibility that this human might be more interesting than expected, Remiel flapped his wings.

Flutter-

"Shall we go?" [Let's go. As an Archangel, I can't just overlook my subordinates being treated like expendables.]

Thud-

Remiel went out of the door.

Would seven Archangels go to meet a human who could be dealt with by sending a 1st rank battle angel? Normally, it was an unimaginable event.

"See? I told you it would pique your interest."

In the empty library, Rubahii muttered to himself.
