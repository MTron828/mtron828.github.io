Title: Episode 254 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Suspicion

Ding-

Ryumin, who opened the door of the cafe, hesitated.

Seeing Minjuri sitting, Ryumin raised her hand discreetly.

Facing Ryumin, Minjuri's piercing gaze brought a little relief to Ryumin.

"Fortunately, her expression seems okay."

She didn't lower her head or avoid eye contact, as she used to do before.

Instead, she had a confident look in her eyes, as if she would tie up loose ends this time.

"I already ordered my coffee. Thanks."

"No."

"......"

"......"

The awkwardness between them lingered.

Even though Ryumin had rejected the confession and expressed a desire to remain friends first, she didn't think it would be easy.

"If we meet like this frequently, things will gradually get better. Minjuri probably doesn't want to leave things awkward between us."

So, wasn't it natural for her to willingly respond to her invitation?

"Minah."

"Yeah?"

Calling her first, Minjuri fell silent.

Seeing her lips quivering, it seemed she was going through internal conflict.

Waiting patiently, Minjuri soon opened her mouth as if she had made up her mind.

"You mentioned before that we should be friends, right?"

"Yeah, I did."

"At that time, I was honestly confused, but now I've firmly made up my mind."

Minjuri's eyes sparkled with determination.

"Let's be friends. However..."

Feeling a bit awkward, Minjuri lowered her gaze.

"Please forget about the confession I made before. Can you do that?"

"Whatever. Of course."

Was it too quick of a response?

Minjuri's eyebrows twitched.

A face trampled by pride.

Before misunderstandings could escalate, Ryumin spoke.

"I answered a bit hastily, but don't misunderstand. It doesn't mean your confession doesn't matter at all. Erasing it from memory is difficult. But if you want, I'll do my best to..."

"No."

Minjuri's gaze was now ablaze with pride.

"My thoughts have changed."

"Yeah?"

"Don't forget. Don't erase it from your memory. I definitely confessed to you, and you rejected me. That's a fact, right?"

Her voice conveyed a sense of trembling.

It felt like an impulsive outburst driven by wounded pride.

"I'll honestly tell you what's going on. I haven't given up yet. I don't want to miss the chance to be friends with you either. Think about it. Can human emotions cool off so easily? I still... like you."

Even though she felt embarrassed after saying it, she lowered her gaze with her last words.

"I won't give up. You'll make me like you. So, please let us continue as friends. Give us a chance to develop beyond friendship. That's my sincere feeling. Can you do that?"

"...."

Ryumin's mouth didn't easily open.

It wasn't a matter of figuring out how to reject what was said.

'Rejection is not an option. I can't afford to lose the buffer.'

She was just a bit taken aback after hearing the sincerity.

"Okay."

"Huh?"

"Do as you like."

"Really?"

"Whatever. We're friends, after all."

"...."

It was a line drawn, but Minjuri didn't give up.

She continued to challenge, recalling the advice of the Black Scythe to keep trying.

"Just being satisfied with that is enough."

Only now did a smile appear on Minjuri's face.

"Is this okay?"

"Yeah."

"Good. Now, let me tell you the strategy for Round 16."

In order to change the atmosphere, Ryumin quickly explained the strategy.

In the process, Minjuri's eyes widened in surprise.

"Is the next round really going to proceed like that?"

"Yeah. So, be careful not to get hurt as much as possible. The Black Scythe will probably soon gather the followers and share the strategy."

"Did you talk to the Black Scythe about the future?"

"I did."

"I was actually planning to ask if you two share information..."

"We've been sharing from the beginning."

"Then why does the Black Scythe choose information about the next round as a reward? Couldn't you just get the prophecy from you?"

"Because I can't see the future rigidly at a predetermined time. The rounds I couldn't foresee are filled by the Black Scythe using rewards."

It was a shameless lie, but Minjuri, now seemingly satisfied, nodded as if things made sense.

"I'm relieved. I thought our relationship wasn't good again..."

'Not good. It's the same body after all.'

She still couldn't reveal to Minjuri that she was the Black Scythe. Right now, it would only be poison to disclose it.

'Maybe she'll tremble with betrayal because I've deceived her so skillfully until now.'
ChatGPT

There was nothing to gain, so it had to be kept hidden.

"I'm sorry about earlier."

Ryumin grinned as she suddenly apologized, looking at Minjuri.

"What for?"

"I kind of had a sudden outburst earlier, without realizing it..."

"No, it's nothing..."

For Ryumin, it felt good to have returned to being friends with Minjuri, much like before.

'Strictly speaking, it's different.'

Upon closer inspection, the situation was similar to giving Minjuri another chance, delaying the confession.

"But hey, Min, you joined the Cult of the Reapers, right?"

"Yeah? That's right. Why do you ask?"

"Lately, even when I go to the Cult of the Reapers, I don't see your presence."

"I haven't been active; I just left my name there. It would be troublesome if my existence became known to others."

"True. If people find out you have the Prophet class, they'll be all over you, right?"

"Exactly."

As Minjuri sipped her lukewarm coffee, she still had a curious expression when looking at Ryumin.

"If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."

"Oh, it's nothing... Did you also receive a summons from the Black Scythe in Round 15? Was your nickname Lost Yak?"

"Oh? Ah, right."

"But why don't I have any memories of hearing about it?"

'Well, because I never called you.'

Ryumin responded with a casual face.

"You probably didn't hear. Otherwise, how would I have survived like this?"

"Is that so? Well..."

Since Minjuri hadn't heard all 576 nicknames, she didn't doubt it and let it pass.

"Well, since we're done talking, shall we get going?"

"Yeah."

The two of them, now outside the cafe, shook hands with each other.

"Thanks for sharing the strategy. Let's meet again sometime."

"Yeah. I'll contact you occasionally."

As Ryumin walked down the street with a smile, she thought to herself.

"Thank goodness. Minjuri seems to be in a good state."

It seemed like she had taken the advice of the Black Scythe from the other realm well.

Although declaring her intention to continue challenging felt burdensome...

"At least it's better than being sulky."

To navigate through the remaining rounds, Minjuri needed to be mentally sound.

It would be problematic if she remained in a low mood just because of the rejection.

"Especially in Round 16, she'll need to be fully alert."
ChatGPT

One wrong move could lead to significant damage in this round.

'After Round 16, a player's value will likely skyrocket. People's perspectives will change.'

The reputation of the Cult of the Reapers aside, one could also obtain runes in reality.

'I should recruit members for the Cult of the Reapers soon and share the strategy. But before that, I need to clear up the misunderstanding with Kristin.'

Even if Kristin didn't know, there was a high chance she misunderstood Ryumin for sparing Jon Delgado.

Since Kristin was an important supporter like Minjuri, it was necessary to take care of her mentally.

Ryumin picked up Lost Yak's phone and called Kristin.

"Kristin."

Oh, Black Scythe?

"I have something to discuss. I'd like to meet regarding the strategy for the next round."

Oh, um, can't we do it over the phone?

'Over the phone?'

Until now, strategy discussions had been in person.

"For security reasons, phone calls are not possible."

Is that so?

"Why? Is there a reason we can't meet?"

Oh, no. There's no reason. It's just that I have some free time...

"Then I'll come to your place. There's no quiet place to talk around here."

No, instead of you going through all that trouble, I can...

"I'll be comfortable with the First Class. Don't worry. I'll call you again when I arrive."

With what seemed like considerate words, Ryumin said she would come over first.

Moving around suited her temperament more than waiting silently.

'I need to explain properly when we meet.'

Thinking about what to say, Ryumin started looking into tickets to the United States.

After putting down the phone, Kristin stared into space for a while with a blank expression.

'Ah, the Black Scythe...finally coming here...'

Meeting the Black Scythe in reality was not a first for her.

Therefore, the emotions she felt now were not excitement.

Anxiety.

Kristin's face was filled with anxiety.

The fear that the Black Scythe might notice.

'No, it'll be fine. I've hidden it well for a few days. I didn't show it even in the other realm.'

Though she tried not to show it, she knew.

Well, saying she knew might be premature.

It's more accurate to call it a stage of speculation, a stage of suspicion.
ChatGPT

'Prophet and the Black Scythe being the same person...'

It was a dangerous assumption.

It was an absurd assumption.

'Who would ever match the seemingly weak Prophet and the formidable Black Scythe?'

Because they had completely opposite images, no one could make the connection.

However, Kristin believed that they were the same person.

It wasn't a baseless inference.

When the Prophet recently came to the United States, Kristin witnessed a murder.

With the Prophet carried on their back.

'Using their ability to kill the gunmen who pointed their guns at them.'

At that time, she wasn't particularly shocked due to being half-asleep.

She thought it was a dream and went back to sleep.

'When I woke up, I was inside the church.'

The Prophet had disappeared without a trace.

Later, the thought crossed her mind that it might not have been a dream, but she had no certainty.

There was no evidence even when she went back to the scene.

'I couldn't establish a connection with the Black Scythe either.'

But seeing the Black Scythe using a shadow-like ability in the other realm made her reconsider.

Perhaps... what she saw back then wasn't a dream.

The Black Scythe and the Prophet could be the same person.

Of course, this thought was purely based on suspicion and inference.

There was no evidence.

"No, it can't be. The same person... what... maybe just similar abilities. The images don't overlap at all."

Kristin mumbled with an uneasy expression.

Without realizing someone had entered the range of her detection.

"What do you mean?"

"Huk!"

Kristin's shoulders jumped at the unexpected appearance of Jeffrey.

"Why are you so startled? It's like you've seen a ghost."

"Oh... no, it's nothing."

"Your expression doesn't look good. What's wrong?"

"Nothing, really... nothing like that."

Although Kristin drew a clear line, Jeffrey felt even more suspicious.

"Come on, spill it. If you have worries, I'll listen. If it's a concern, I'll try to help."

"I said there's nothing."

"You're still upset with me?"

"Upset? Who said I am? I told you there's nothing to worry about."

"If you keep denying it, how would I know? I've been watching over you for a dozen years, but I can't understand Kristin?"

"...."
ChatGPT

"Don't say that and just tell me. What's bothering you?"

Persistent questioning made Kristin sigh, feeling compelled to say something.

With the thought that she had to throw something out, she let out a bit.

"What if you find out that someone who seemed weak actually hid their strength?"

"They hid their strength? Who is it?"

"No, I asked first. You have to answer...."

"Hmm...."

Jeffrey, who had been contemplating, opened his mouth.

"If it were me, I'd probably just pretend not to know and stay quiet."

"Why?"

"Hiding their strength implies they don't want to reveal it, right? If you respect the other person, there's no need to pretend to know and cause unnecessary anxiety."

"Indeed, that makes sense."

Kristin's expression brightened a bit.

Thinking that there was someone with a similar opinion relieved her frustration.

"So, who is this nerd who hid their strength?"

"Nerd? Be careful with your words!"

"Oh? Judging by your reaction, it seems like you're somewhat close to this person?"

"Oh, come on! I won't tell you. Don't ask anymore. End of discussion!"

Saying that, Kristin walked away with quick steps, as if avoiding an awkward situation.

"Hmm...."

Jeffrey, who had been observing her suspiciously, soon took out his phone and sent a text message.

[Madam Yumti, there's something unusual.]

Having received orders to report immediately if anything happened.
