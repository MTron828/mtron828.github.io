Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 314"

Episode 314: "Time Will Resolve It"

Ryu Min's face, as he left the press conference venue, was refreshing.

"Now that my identity is revealed, it feels so refreshing."

For a while, he had lived pretending to be someone else, imitating the faces of others.

But now, there is no need for that.

Confidently revealing his face, he can declare that his nickname is Black Scythe.

"Now everyone in the world will know."

Even so, there is no problem.

All threats have been eliminated, and even if there are any left, who would dare to attack Black Scythe?

"Maybe I shouldn't have hidden for so long."

To prevent an unforeseen situation, he had hidden his identity, but it had inadvertently caused harm to those around him.

"It wasn't my intention to cause this... It feels bitter."

Thinking briefly about Min Ju-ri, Ryu Min picked up his phone.

He hesitated to make a call but eventually nodded.

"Time will resolve it."

Putting Min Ju-ri aside, let's first solve the donation issue.

Ryu Min's fingers moved busily, tapping on the phone.

The donation amount nearing 1 trillion won is substantial even for large corporations.

Donating such an amount as an individual is not an easy feat unless one is an extraordinary figure.

Therefore, Ryu Min's donation attracted attention from the public.

"Black Scythe finally reveals his face! Heart-fluttering face that stimulates women's hearts." "The identity of Black Scythe revealed to be a 21-year-old man..." "Black Scythe decides to donate his entire fortune of 990 billion won..." "Breaking news! Confirmation of Black Scythe's donation list at 99 places..."

Smirking while reading the last article, Ryu Min thought, "The articles are really fast."

It hasn't been even an hour since the transfer, and the list has already been posted.

Whether it was announced beforehand or due to the donation itself, the awareness spread quickly.

"The article is not hastily written, and the content is accurate."

Ryu Min donated 100 billion won to 99 places.

Social Contribution Foundation, UNICEF Korea, Green Children Foundation, Korea Elderly Health Association, Korea Pediatric Cancer Foundation, and various other organizations that could make a positive impact.

He carefully selected transparent organizations that could be of help and used his hands to transfer everything in one go within a short period.

As a result, Ryu Min's bank account balance was reduced to zero won.

"My account has become empty. Well, I did leave 100 billion won in my brother's account, though."

The crucial point was to make the donation in his own name and have the balance reach zero.

That was the condition to obtain the rune in the real world.

So, he revealed his identity and donated as if to show off.

"I could donate without revealing my identity, but making it public might boost my reputation, right?"

With the sum of money nearing 1 trillion won, no one would question where it came from.

"I need to donate as much money as possible to get a corresponding rune. That's why I emptied 99% of my cash for this."

Ryu Min doesn't know which rune he will obtain.

The value of the rune varies depending on the amount donated.

"At least I cleared one condition with this."

In fact, the condition to obtain the rune is not just about making donations.

It also involves transferring gold from the game to other players.

"More precisely, I need to reduce both my real-world money and the gold balance in the otherworld to zero."

Only after fulfilling these two conditions for the first time can one obtain the rune.

This is the reason why Ryu Min is currently in the Sasin Guild.

"Once the players gather in the Sasin Guild later, I'll have to distribute all the gold I have. I need to empty all the gold to get the rune."

In the previous round, Ryu Min organized his real-life affairs with the anticipation of the final round approaching.

Considering it might be the last round, he used up all his cash and gold.

"I donated all the cash, and I spent all the gold by purchasing items."

Unexpectedly, he satisfied the conditions and obtained a rune proportional to the amount.

"I got the [Rune of Frenzy] at that time, right? It wasn't a bad rune."

It was a rune that increased attack power proportionally to the damage taken, making it quite useful.

"But the problem was I had no use for it. I disappeared in front of the boss room before even taking damage."

However, this time, the result will be different.

He is confident that he will get a better rune than the Frenzy Rune he obtained back then.

This time, he is determined to empty an astonishing amount of 160 billion gold, unlike before.
ChatGPT

"The donated cash is similar to the previous round, but the gold is different."

Previously, there was only 50 million gold, but now there is 160 billion gold.

Since the gold amount is overwhelmingly high, there might be a distinctly different outcome.

"If I just reduce the gold to zero, I can obtain the rune."

It's better to transfer it to other players rather than consuming it all with items, as it was impossible to do so like before.

With that in mind, Ryu Min sent a summon message to the players early on, but he wasn't sure if Min Ju-ri would come.

"Anyway, I'll know in a short while."

Confirming that the appointed time was approaching, Ryu Min, unlike usual, waited in the yard without a mask.

Then, Um Jun-seok approached from the side.

"Lord Black Scythe. It's hot; please come inside and wait."

"No, I'll wait here. People will be coming soon."

"You can do that, but...?"

Glancing at Um Jun-seok, Ryu Min noticed an unfamiliar expression on his face.

"Why are you like that?"

"Just... It feels strange. I've always seen Lord Black Scythe with a mask, and now to see you without it."

"They must have been surprised to find out I'm Black Scythe."

"They were incredibly surprised. To think that Lord Black Scythe was Lost Yak... I couldn't even imagine."

Um Jun-seok had seen Ryu Min's face when he visited the Sasin Guild with Min Ju-ri before, so it was indeed a surprising revelation.

"Moreover, to donate such a large sum... If it were me, I wouldn't be able to do that."

"I can't help it. I don't have that much money."

"Haha, that's true. Even if I had the money, I wouldn't be able to do it."

After a brief laugh, Um Jun-seok asked in a serious tone.

"Aren't you regretful? You've almost spent all the hard-earned money you collected."

"Money comes and goes."

"What you're saying sounds like someone who's lived for decades. It's hard to believe you're only 21."

Ryu Min had not made any specific mention of his age.

Considering the years he lived through regressions, he was over 110 years old, but Ryu Min didn't want to disclose that information.

"But Lord Black Scythe, didn't you say you didn't know the information for the next round?"

"I did."

"Then why the summon...?"

"I'm not sure if it'll be necessary, but I want to give a gift."

"A gift? What...?"

"It's slowly coming."
ChatGPT

As the appointed time approached, people started appearing one by one.

Seeing Ryu Min without a mask, everyone bowed their heads, acknowledging that they knew he was Black Scythe.

"Lord Black Scythe, we've heard the news. You made a donation, right?"

"It seems like a wonderful thing you've done. Truly remarkable."

"And you've revealed your identity... I didn't know you were this young."

Engaging in various conversations with those who entered, Ryu Min counted the heads.

"Twenty-two, twenty-three..."

As time passed, more people arrived, and when the appointed time arrived, everyone had gathered.

"Excluding me, there are 70 people."

One person was missing.

Since he had checked their faces, it was easy to see who hadn't come.

"Time will take care of it..."

Uttering like casting a spell, Ryu Min spoke to the audience.

"I've called you here before the last round for no other reason than to give you a gift."

"A gift?"

"It's not the kind of gift you're expecting. I don't know the information for the next round, as I mentioned before."

"Then what..."

"First, accept the trade."

Ryu Min grabbed each person one by one and used the trade function.

The players who saw the trade window were surprised.

"T-this much gold?"

"Gold?"

"Is the gift Lord Black Scythe mentioned gold?"

"How much did he give us..."

With curious faces, each player traded with Black Scythe.

The reactions after the trade were consistent.

Eyes widened at the unimaginable amount of money that no one could predict when they would use.

As Ryu Min distributed close to 23 billion gold per person.

"With this money, you can spend it lavishly in the shops and still have some left."

"I-I have way too much left over."

"When will I ever use all of this?"

While players were astonished, they were also perplexed.

Having this much gold at the moment seemed useless.

None of the players showed any signs of dissatisfaction.

"Sorry for using you like this, but please take care of the gold for a while. I really need to obtain the last rune available in reality."
ChatGPT

That moment, as Ryu Min distributed the gold to the last 70th player, reducing the gold to zero, an alert window appeared only in his eyes.

[Have reduced the currency of the real world and the currency of the otherworld to zero.]
[Activated conditions have been fulfilled.]
[Basic conditions met: Possessing assets over 10 billion.]
[Basic conditions met: Holding gold over 10 million.]
[Amount donated in the user's name: 990,000,000,000 won] (Confirmation complete)

[Gold used in the player's name: 160,921,300,920] (Confirmation complete)

[Confirmed as the player who first organized cash.]
[Rune will be granted proportional to the donated amount and used gold.]
[Finding the rune corresponding to the amount...]
[Congratulations! The 'Transcendence Rune' has been obtained.]
[The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!]

As Ryu Min obtained the rune according to his plan, a smile appeared on his lips.

"I finally collected all 18 runes on the list."

The rune that came in proportion to cash and gold was the Transcendence Rune, a new rune he had never seen before compared to the ones he obtained before by spending gold.

"Shall I check what kind of rune this is?"

Ryu Min's eyes widened as he quickly opened the information.

[My name is Ryu Min. I'm officially 20 years old, and this is my real appearance...]

A video of Ryu Min's explosive statement at the press conference was playing on TV.

Although Ryu Min's face and identity were now revealed nationwide, if not worldwide, Min Ju-ri seemed indifferent and simply turned off the TV.

Once a person she loved, but now just an embarrassing face to look at.

"From the first time we met until now, after 20 rounds, you deceived me."

Of course, she understood that he didn't deceive her for the sake of amusement.

She understood that he hid his identity to avoid confusion and to protect those around him.

Knowing all that, why does her heart feel so uncomfortable and sad?

Why does it feel like she's been betrayed by the person she loves?

Why does she feel like he played with her?

"The Min I thought was always kind... had a different mask all along."

In that painful moment of reflection, as she clutched her head.
ChatGPT

A flash of insight crossed Min Ju-ri's mind.

"Oh."

She realized.

"Why did I think Min would be innocent? Was I the one trapped in prejudice? Am I feeling this way because my bias has been shattered?"

Upon careful reflection, it became clear.

She wasn't betrayed by the person she loves right now.

She had only framed the concept of betrayal as a defense mechanism for her shattered bias.

Her own discomfort was merely a reaction to the uncomfortable truth.

"Why did I think Min, who I believed was always kind, had a different mask?"

In the midst of this self-reflection, she bit her tail of thoughts.

Feeling a sense of disgust with herself, Min Ju-ri suddenly had an epiphany.

"Ah."

She woke up.

"Why did I think Min would be naive? Was I the one trapped in prejudice? Am I reacting like this because I'm uncomfortable with my shattered bias?"

As she thought it through, she realized it clearly.

She wasn't betrayed by the person she loves; she had merely imposed the frame of betrayal as a defense mechanism for her shattered bias.

Her psyche wasn't strong enough to confront an uncomfortable truth to the point of facing it.

"Gross."

She found herself utterly repulsive.

Blaming the man she had secretly admired for over four years, not as another person but as a defense mechanism for the shattered bias due to the collapsed prejudice.

"This won't do. I have to say sorry. Otherwise, I'll really..."

In a hurry, Min Ju-ri sent a message to Ryu Min.

Let's meet.

Let's talk.

There's no more time to organize thoughts.
