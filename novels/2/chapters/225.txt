Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 225"

One More Reward

He had killed the 4th and 5th Archangels.

Ryumin truly felt this fact after checking the message.

[You have defeated the 7 Archangels 'Raguel'!] [Stat Points +14,536] [Gold +145,366,800] [As a reward for killing Archangel Raguel, 'Condensed Ether' has appeared.] [As a reward for killing Archangel Raguel, 'Rune of Judgment' has appeared.] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!] [The reputation of the Demon faction has greatly increased.] [You have defeated the 7 Archangels 'Uriel'!] [Stat Points +18,170] [Gold +181,708,500] [As a reward for killing Archangel Uriel, 'Condensed Ether' has appeared.] [As a reward for killing Archangel Uriel, 'Rune of Radiance' has appeared.] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!] [The reputation of the Demon faction has greatly increased.] [The Demon faction's reputation for the 'Black Scythe' has risen from 'Very Friendly' to 'Eternal Alliance.']

As expected, two Ethers came in.

'Now I can make a god-grade weapon.'

The stat points also increased tremendously.

'5th-grade angels, 100 of them are 7,200, and the 2 Archangels are 32,706 in total...'

Nearly 40,000 stats in total.

An overwhelming figure.

Gold had also surged to 4 billion.

Not only that, but the reputation for the Demon faction had also reached its maximum.

From the Demon's perspective, it was natural for Ryumin, who had defeated the leader of the enemies, to be treated as a hero.

But more than anything, where Ryumin's gaze lingered was none other than the Rune Information Window.

[Rune of Judgment]

-Effect: Accumulates Judgment stacks 1 (up to 100) every time an enemy is killed.

Consumes 100 Judgment stacks to use 'Celestial Judgment,' dealing magical damage in an X-shaped area in front of you, equivalent to 2,400% of intelligence.

[Light Rune]

-Effect: Allows movement using light.

Speed of Light ▶ Can quickly move in a straight line up to a distance of 1,000m as if it were light. Stops if obstructed by an object.
ChatGPT

└ Transmission ▶ Sends light (up to 100m) and moves oneself to the illuminated area.

└ Invocation ▶ Sends light (up to 100m) and moves the illuminated target in front of oneself.

'One is an attack used by Raguel, and the other is a movement technique used by Uriel.'

According to the description, both were efficient.

Especially satisfying was the fact that both were of the sacred attribute.

Ryumin had the radiant rune, which amplified the effects of sacred attribute skills as much as his level.

'Both seem good, but the Light Rune seems quite useful. It can summon enemies from a long distance.'

It would be useful when bringing allies or fleeing enemies closer.

'If the effect is amplified by the level, does that mean it can bring an enemy from 192m away if it's increased by 92%?'

The effect of the Speed of Light also looked good.

If there were no obstacles, it could cover a maximum distance of 1,920m in an instant.

'I should check the cooldown later.'

For now, it's time to check something else.

"Now you can come out. It's safe."

Rustle- Rustle-

At Ryumin's call, footsteps were heard from behind.

Turning his head, it was none other than John Delga.

This guy was the last person Ryumin had found before meeting the angels.

"I- Is all of this what you did, Master?"

John couldn't close his mouth after seeing the scene turned into ruins as if a bomber had passed by.

"Well, yeah. It wasn't a fierce battle, contrary to appearances."

It was more trivial than intense.

With the skills of the 4th and 5th-ranked angels, he was confident enough to face the 1st-ranked angel right away.

'No. Is the 1st rank too much?'

Although he didn't know the rank of the archangel he met in the 68th episode, he guessed it might not be the 1st rank.

The strength he felt back then was on a different level compared to the archangel he faced now.

"What do you want me to do?"

After John's question, Ryumin snapped back to reality and pointed to a soldier lying on the side.

"First, try turning one of the angels into an actual undead. There's something I want to test. Shouldn't be a problem with your skill level, right?"

Upon seeing the angel's corpse, John nodded.

"Of course. You killed it quite cleanly. With this level, it should be absolutely possible."
ChatGPT

The necromancy of the sorcerer has two types.

One is ethereal undead, which enslaves the soul, and the other is corporeal undead, which raises the body.

Only one of the two could be used on a single corpse, and unlike ethereal undead, corporeal undead required the body to be relatively intact.

'Moreover, unlike ethereal undead, it's a one-time use.'

In return, it is stronger than ethereal undead and has immunity to magical damage.

'Additionally, if killed, it gives rewards.'

Usually, summoning creatures doesn't yield any rewards, but corporeal undead was different.

Perhaps because it was a one-time summon, killing it still gave about 50% of the original reward.

The part Ryumin wanted to experiment with was right here.

'I wonder if killing an angel turned into a corporeal undead will still yield the same reward.'

To test this, he first killed the initial 100 soldiers by breaking only their necks, leaving their bodies relatively intact.

The remaining 100 had to be quickly annihilated due to urgency.

"Now, resurrect it."

"Yes, Master."

John aimed his staff at the corpse and used the 'Corpse Resurrection' skill.

Squelch-

The broken neck of the angel returned to its original position, and it opened its eyes with intact eye sockets.

Although it was undead, its eyes only showed whites.

"I have resurrected it as per your command, Master."

"Is that one under your control?"

"Well, yes, but it will be perceived as an enemy by other players."

"Good. Now, let's see if it can be killed."

Without hesitation, Ryumin swung his scythe and beheaded the angel.

Thunk-

Then, something astonishing happened.

[You have defeated the 5th-grade angel 'Oliver'!] [Stat Points +36] [Gold +363,417] [Angels defeated: 103/100] [Judgment Rune Stack: 2/100]

Having captured the angel turned into a corporeal undead, the number count increased from 102 to 103.

Surprisingly, all the expected rewards also came in.

'I expected it, but to actually receive rewards.'

However, the rewards were only half of the original.

It seems that the power of the corporeal undead is only half as effective as when it was alive.

'Even though it can only resurrect once per corpse, this alone is quite impressive.'

With this, John Delga's value skyrocketed.
ChatGPT

It was a good decision not to kill that guy outright.

"John, resurrect all the angels as corporeal undead."

"Yes, understood."

"Oh, wait a moment."

Ryumin, who had halted the command, suddenly had a thought.

'Wouldn't it be better to kill them again after invoking the Devil's Blessing once more, rather than killing them now?'

Ryumin had killed the initial 100 soldiers and used the Devil's Blessing.

Now, he had killed the remaining 100 soldiers and Archangels, fully stacking the effect.

In other words, he could use the Devil's Blessing once more.

'Since I've killed the Archangels and raised my stats, using the blessing again will likely yield more rewards.'

Moreover, if he kills all the corpses here, he can fill the stack up to 100.

'First, I need to distribute the stats.'

Ryumin opened the status window and distributed the 39,906 stat points evenly across four stats. After that, he instructed John.

"Resurrect all the angels here."

"Yes, understood."

John sequentially turned them into corporeal undead.

Unlike ethereal undead, corporeal undead, being one-time summons, were not restricted by the number.

They couldn't be carried around like regular summons.

'So, I need to dispose of them all here.'

After a while, except for one killed for testing, a total of 101 corporeal undead were created.

"There are 101 enemies within a radius of 100m." "With the Rune of Hundredfold, all stats increase by 100%."

Since the summons were recognized as enemies, the Rune of Hundredfold increased their stats.

The reason Ryumin hadn't used the blessing yet was right here.

To maximize the stats.

The deification effect from killing an angel earlier was still in effect.

Now was the perfect time to use it.

'Devil's Blessing.'
ChatGPT

[Devil's Blessing has been activated.] [Based on the current total stats (2,019,892), the following effects are applied.] [Upon defeating an angel, acquire gold equal to 1x the base value (2,019,892). Depending on the angel's level, it can increase up to 1,000x (2,019,892,000).] [Upon defeating an angel, gain stat points equal to 0.01% of the base value (201). Depending on the angel's level, it can increase up to a maximum of 10% (201,989).] [Upon defeating an angel, the reputation of the Demon faction slightly increases.] [The buff will persist until the end of the current round.]

Using the Devil's Blessing greatly increased the rewards compared to before.

'It increased by more than five times.'

Ryumin killed the resurrected angels once again on the spot.

Although it was a repetitive act of killing the deceased twice, it didn't matter.

As long as he gained rewards, that was enough for him.

Squelch-! Squelch-!

As he swiftly killed the standing undead, the stats quickly accumulated.

[Angels defeated: 99/100] [Judgment Rune Stack: 100/100] [You can consume 100 stacks to use 'Celestial Judgment.']

Dealing with 99 undead soldiers brought in nearly 20,000 stats and 200 million gold.

Now, only the Archangels remained.

Ryumin stood before the resurrected Raguel and Uriel once again.

These soulless entities showed no animosity towards Ryumin.

They didn't even recognize him.

Squelch-!

[You have defeated the 7th-grade Archangel 'Raguel'!] [Stat Points +40,397] [Gold +403,978,400] [Angels defeated: 100/100] [Condition for using Devil's Blessing is fulfilled.] [You can use 'Devil's Blessing' by memorizing the activation command.]

Even with 50%, a tremendous reward was granted.

The higher base value resulted in receiving more than before.

'But items and runes were not given again.'

Perhaps because he had already obtained them once, there was no duplicate reward.

The soul-binding quest was also the same.

└Defeat 7 Archangels

└Current number of Archangels defeated (4/7)

└Upon success ▶ ?????

The count did not increase at all, no matter how many times he killed the same one.

In the end, it seemed he had to kill all seven different Archangels.

'Right. Let's go all the way. After all, I owe the angels a debt. I'm curious about the reward for the soul-binding quest too.'

Even if he didn't know how strong the 1st rank was, to kill that one, he needed to become even stronger.

[You have defeated the 7th-grade Archangel 'Uriel'!] [Stat Points +50,497] [Gold +504,973,000] [Angels defeated: 101/100]

'With 15 billion gold and 110,000 remaining stat points.'

It was truly overwhelming.

The rewards were nearly tripled compared to the beginning.

'Using the necromancer really made me this powerful.'

Ryumin, considering bringing him along just for the rewards, asked John, who was standing dumbfounded.

"How far did you go with the sub-quests?"

"I completed the errand quests."

"It's probably delayed because of me. I'll take you to the Holy Empire, so finish it as quickly as possible."

"Understood."

'You have to survive with me until the last round.'

Ryumin, hiding his true thoughts, used the Erase Tracks skill to eliminate the traces of the angels' corpses with John.

"Let's go. Hold on."

Lifting John, Ryumin used the Rune of Radiance to swiftly leave at the speed of light.

[Time remaining until the end of the round: 00:00:00]

As the given 10 hours passed, players scattered throughout the fantasy world gathered at the starting point, a colorless space.

"Has it already been 10 hours?"
ChatGPT

"Ah, damn it! I was in the middle of a quest!"

"Crazy! We just needed one more to finish!"

"What do we do? I'm screwed."

Players who hadn't yet raised their reputation to friendly were kneeling and lamenting.

On the other hand, even those who were late to raise their reputation were desperately praying to fall within the half category.

Even though the results that had already come out wouldn't change.

"[Hoho, well done for the past 10 hours, humans. Turns out, raising your reputation is harder than you thought, huh?]"

"...."

[No response? Maybe it was easy after all? I'm curious to see how many of you made it through. Let's hope it's not another shortfall like last time. Hehe.]

As the angel openly mocked them, the signal was sent, and the tally results appeared.
