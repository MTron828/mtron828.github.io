Chapter 4246 - Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation

“What were you calling a cheap trick again?” Chu Feng asked whilst looking at Lu Jie.

Lu Jie turned green in the face.

He had thought that his grand slaughtering formation would most definitely be able to breach Chu Feng’s grand formation.

Never did he imagine that Chu Feng’s protective formation would possess such power.

He’d actually lost the first round!

This was completely different from what he had anticipated.

“Amazing.”

“The battle power of Chu Feng’s spirit formation seems to have surpassed rank two Utmost Exalted.”

“That’s simply too terrifying. He actually really managed to defeat Lu Jie.”

At that moment, many of the younger generation were bowled over by Chu Feng’s performance.

Some even felt that Lu Jie, although extremely powerful, might be defeated by Chu Feng.

But, just imagining that the renowned Lu Jie would be defeated caused many people to feel their scalps go numb.

Before Chu Feng showed up, such a thing was simply something impossible. Yet, it seemed like it might really happen now.

“Although Chu Feng has put forth an astonishing performance, it is still too early to say that he has already won.”

“Lu Jie is most proficient in defensive formations. Offensive formations aren’t his speciality.”

“Besides, he has grasped that spirit formation already.”

But, there were experts of the older generation that did not think that Chu Feng’s victory was decided.

Right at that moment, Lu Jie began setting up his spirit formation.

He did not respond to Chu Feng’s question, and started setting up the spirit formation for the second confrontation immediately.

Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately began setting up his own spirit formation.

In the blink of an eye, another incense stick’s worth of time had passed.

The two of them had both completed their grand formations.

Chu Feng’s spirit formation was a spheroid.

The spheroid was floating above his head. The five elements of wind, lightning, water, fire and earth were spinning within the spheroid.

Violent gales swept throughout the surroundings.

Piercing thunder rumbled throughout the sky.

Giant waves and blazing light filled the entire sky.

The power of the earth and wind were interwoven into a massive sandstorm.

Chu Feng’s spirit formation filled the entire region with the power of the five elements.

Although those were only the remnant energies of the spirit formation, it caused the surroundings to at times, turn incomparably dusky, and at times blazing with fiery light.

It would not be excessive to say that it resembled hell.

Most importantly, the might emitted by Chu Feng’s slaughtering formation was much stronger than Lu Jie’s ten golden spears from before.

Ignoring all else, merely in terms of their slaughtering formations, Chu Feng had surpassed Lu Jie.

“This Chu Feng is truly powerful. He was actually able to set up such a powerful slaughtering formation. Likely, apart from him, no one else among the people of the younger generation would be able to set up such a powerful slaughtering formation.”

Many people exclaimed in admiration at Chu Feng’s slaughtering formation.

“But, if he wants to defeat Lu Jie with that, it won’t be so easy.”

“After all, Lu Jie has perfected that grand protective formation.”

Even though the crowd all felt that Chu Feng’s grand slaughtering formation was exceptional, they still felt that the outcome of the match remained undecided when they looked at Lu Jie.

Some people even felt that Chu Feng might not be able to defeat Lu Jie’s spirit formation.

They felt that the match would most likely end in a tie.

The reason for that was because the defensive formation that Lu Jie had set up was extremely powerful.

That defensive formation was a giant statue.

The statue measured a thousand meters tall. As it stood in midair, it looked like a mountain.

The sculpture was that of a giant bear. The giant bear had a robust build. At that moment, it had its eyes closed. It appeared as if it was training.

As for Lu Jie, he sat cross-legged atop the sculpture.

He was not hidden inside the body of the sculpture, nor was he hidden behind the sculpture. Rather, he was sitting atop it.

Logically, such behavior was very dangerous. It was totally possible for Chu Feng’s attacks to easily reach him..

But, it just so happened that no one dared look down on Lu Jie.

Instead, they all felt that it would be very difficult for Chu Feng to destroy Lu Jie’s grand protective formation, much less injure Lu Jie.

The reason why the crowd felt this way was because Lu Jie’s grand formation had a grand origin.

That spirit formation was called the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation!

That spirit formation had originated from the Ancient Era. It was something that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had acquired from an Ancient Era’s remnant.

Up until that moment, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had only taught two of his disciples the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.

The first was the All-seeing Heavenly Master, and the other was Lu Jie.

But, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had more disciples than only the All-seeing Heavenly Master and Lu Jie.

The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had over thirty disciples. Those thirty-some disciples were all extraordinary individuals, and could all be described as geniuses. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

According to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, the reason why he’d only taught the All-seeing Heavenly Master and Lu Jie the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was not because he was prejudiced toward them. Rather, it was because it was extremely difficult to control the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.

If one failed to control the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation, they would receive its backlash.

Amongst the numerous disciples he had, only the All-seeing Heavenly Master and Lu Jie had the ability to handle the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.

The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted was not lying. It was indeed extremely difficult to handle the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.

Even the All-seeing Heavenly Master had only gained mastery over the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation when she reached rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation. Yet, even with that, she still didn’t possess absolute mastery over it.

But, Lu Jie had gained the same degree of mastery over the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation as the All-seeing Heavenly Master had ten years before.

That was also the reason why Lu Jie had been deemed the strongest world spiritist of the younger generation.

He had indeed vividly and thoroughly displayed his talent. It could be said that his talent was simply unprecedented.

Although the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation that Lu Jie had set up was much smaller than what the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted was capable of setting up, its form was complete.

A complete form was the manifestation of mastery.

Compared to ten years before, Lu Jie had advanced again.

His mastery over the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation had surpassed that of his senior sister, the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

Even when compared to his master, he was only slightly inferior.

Such a Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation would be extremely powerful.

That was the reason why the crowd felt that it would be very difficult for Chu Feng to defeat Lu Jie after seeing his Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.

The people of the older generation present had witnessed with their very eyes how powerful a complete Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was.

It was a spirit formation that was abnormally and freakishly strong. Unless one possessed a battle power that surpassed it, simply no one with the same battle power would be able to breach it.

“Chu Feng, earlier, you asked me what I was calling a cheap trick?”

“Let me say it again to you. Your spirit formations are nothing more than cheap tricks.”

Lu Jie not only sneered at Chu Feng, he also had a look of absolute confidence on his face.

Even though he was extremely shocked to have his grand slaughtering formation breached by Chu Feng, he did not believe that Chu Feng would be able to breach his Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.

“I’m the person that has won once right now.”

“If my spirit formations are cheap tricks, would it mean that your spirit formations are inferior to even cheap tricks?”

Chu Feng was not angered by Lu Jie’s ridicule. Instead, he questioned him with a smile on his face.

“If you’re able to breach this spirit formation of mine, I will admit that you’re above me.”

“Unfortunately, you will never be able to,” Lu Jie said with extreme confidence.

“Is that so?”

Chu Feng revealed a faint smile. He said, “Since that’s the case, I, Chu Feng, will have you realize today that you, Lu Jie, are beneath me.”

“Boom---”

After saying those words, Chu Feng pointed his hands at Lu Jie.

Wind, lightning, water, fire and earth, the power of the five elements, roared with trembling vibrations like ferocious beasts capable of utter destruction, and rushed toward Lu Jie at the same time.

The five different powers covered heaven and earth. Everywhere they passed, even space itself was destroyed.

The destructive power was simply several times stronger than Lu Jie’s ten golden spears.

Sensing that power, many people of the younger generation turned pale with fear.

Earlier, they had still been slightly unwilling to accept Chu Feng’s talent.

They did not believe there to be that enormous of a disparity between themselves and Chu Feng.

But, after they personally sensed the might of Chu Feng’s spirit formation, they had no choice but to admit that they were indeed inferior to Chu Feng.

In fact, after seeing how mighty Chu Feng’s spirit formation was, even Lu Jie’s expression changed somewhat.

He truly hadn’t expected Chu Feng to be able to set up such a powerful slaughtering formation.

But, he didn’t panic either. Instead, the smile on his face grew even stronger.

His expression seemed to indicate that victory was already in his grasp.

His confidence seemed to be saying that no matter how powerful Chu Feng might be, he wouldn’t be able to defeat him, Lu Jie.
