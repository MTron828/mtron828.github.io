MGA: Chapter 1621 - Staying As Guests

“Chu Feng, who exactly helped us earlier?” Nangong Ya and the others asked together. They all knew that mysterious expert had left. However, that expert’s divine might still lingered in their hearts.

“That is a senior who I know. However, he did not wish to reveal his identity to others. Thus, I’m afraid that I cannot tell everyone who he is. Please forgive me,” Chu Feng explained while smiling. He knew very well that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal did not reveal himself, as he had instead secretly sent a voice transmission to him.

“We understand this. Experts are all like this. Haha...” Nangong Ya laughed tactfully.

“Regardless of who he is, he is extremely powerful. Before him, Evildoer Tie was unable to withstand a single blow. At the very least, he should be a rank two Martial Emperor, right?” Nangong Baihe said.

“I’m afraid that wouldn’t be the case. The way I see it, he should be at least a rank three Martial Emperor,” Nangong Ya said.

“Rank three Martial Emperor? Wouldn’t that mean that he’s as powerful as Lord Clan Chief?” Hearing what Nangong Ya said, Nangong Baihe opened her mouth wide, and incomparable shock shone through her beautiful eyes.

“I have seen Lord Clan Chief’s attacks before. Thus, I know how powerful he is. The aura revealed by that expert earlier was not at all weaker than Lord Clan Chief’s. Thus, his cultivation is most definitely not inferior to Lord Clan Chief’s,” Nangong Ya said.

“Not inferior to Lord Clan Chief? He’s actually that powerful?” Hearing those words, the gaze with which Nangong Baihe looked to Chu Feng changed again. It changed to a very complicated gaze. She had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.

The grand Nangong Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief could be said to be one of the most famous grand characters in the Holy Land of Martialism. Not only was he very renowned, he was also extremely powerful.

Thus, Nangong Baihe had not expected that mysterious expert who had helped Chu Feng to be this powerful. Moreover, she had never expected Chu Feng to possess such a powerful backer.

Before, she had only thought that Chu Feng was a rare genius who possessed exceptional talent. However, she had now discovered that not only did Chu Feng possess strength himself, he also possessed an enormously powerful backer. His background was simply unfathomable.

Chu Feng was like a mystery, a frightening mystery.

“But... why didn’t that senior kill Evildoer Tie?” The innocent Nangong Moli blinked her large eyes and asked in a confused manner. She had asked the key question.

That Evildoer Tie was someone who had committed countless evil crimes. He was someone who could not be forgiven. Since he had been captured, it was only logical to kill him and not release him.

When even Nangong Moli understood this, how could Chu Feng and the others not understand this?

“Regardless of why he did that, it remains that he has saved our lives today,” Aunt Lian smiled. After her battle to the death, she seemed to feel a lot more relieved.

She looked to Chu Feng and said, “The reason why he acted to save us is all because of you, Chu Feng. Thus, in the end, Chu Feng, you have saved us today.”

“Chu Feng, in order to express my thanks, you must stay as a guest at our Nangong Imperial Clan. I must entertain you properly there.”

“That’s right. Chu Feng, you must come to our Nangong Imperial Clan,” In response, Nangong Baihe also echoed.

“Very well. I’ll go,” Chu Feng nodded while smiling. Currently, Chu Feng had offended the Beitang Imperial Clan. Thus, it was not suitable for him to travel alone. If he could stay at the Nangong Imperial Clan temporarily, it would be a pretty good option for the time being.

“Miss Tantai, Senior Hong, the two of you should come too,” Nangong Ya invited them.

“Very well, this old man has never been to the Nangong Imperial Clan. Furthermore, my injuries will require some time to heal,” Hong Qiang immediately accepted. He also wished to experience the Nangong Imperial Clan. As for Tantai Xue, she did not say anything. However, she nodded her head.

Just like that, Chu Feng and the others did not stop to rest, and instead proceeded directly toward the Nangong Imperial Clan.

After journeying for some time, Chu Feng and the others finally arrived at the Nangong Imperial Clan.

What appeared before them was an enormous mountain range. The peaks of the mountains reached the clouds. The mountains continued toward both sides and appeared to be borderless.

This mountain range was not a place where anyone could enter. There was a spirit formation set up by a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist around the mountain range. This spirit formation was different from the one around the Yan Clan. It was extremely powerful. Likely, even ordinary rank one Martial Emperors would not be able to break through it.

Following Aunt Lian and the others, Chu Feng entered the mountain range. Right after he entered it, many Nangong Imperial Clansman wearing armor appeared. It was clear that this mountain range was heavily guarded by many guards.

However, when they saw Aunt Lian and the others, they immediately bowed their heads to greet them. None of them dared to stop Aunt Lian and the others and they even began to open up a path for them to pass through. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

While walking through the mountain range, Chu Feng discovered that this mountain range possessed many traps. Furthermore, both the sky and the ground possessed defensive barriers. The defense of this mountain range was many times stronger than that of the Cyanwood Mountain or the World Spiritist Alliance. It was truly worthy of the Nangong Imperial Clan’s reputation.

However, with Aunt Lian with them, Chu Feng and the others would naturally not be hindered in the slightest. They walked past that vast mountain range. After passing through it, what appeared before Chu Feng was a vast land filled with beautiful scenery.

The world before Chu Feng was a world surrounded by a mountain range. Enormous red-crowned cranes and giant birds were flying and spiraling through the skies while hooting.

If these birds were to be placed on the Nine Provinces Continent, they would definitely become beast kings that would rule over a region. However, in this place, they were only ordinary little birds, nothing more than birds that people looked at with pleasure.

In the center of this place was a vast city. Not only was that city very large, it was also golden-bright and dazzling. That city was built with gold. All of the bricks and roof tiles were gold. From this, one could imagine how gorgeous that city was.

Evidently, that city was the place where the Nangong Imperial Clansmen lived.

After approaching the city, Chu Feng discovered that there was a spirit formation around it. Furthermore, that spirit formation was no ordinary defensive formation. Instead, it was an enormously powerful slaughtering formation. This spirit formation did not require world spiritists to activate it. Ordinary martial cultivators were capable of activating it. This spirit formation was many times stronger than the spirit formation around the mountain range.

At this moment, what Chu Feng and the others felt the most of was pressure. This Nangong Imperial Clan gave off an enormous amount of oppression. This sort of oppression was not only because of the Nangong Imperial Clan’s powerful spirit formations, the rigid defense that guarded this place or the vast and gorgeous buildings. Mainly, it was because of the people.

Each and every one of the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan was emitting an air of arrogance. In this place, their airs of arrogance were magnified by an unbounded amount. After all, this was their territory.

Perhaps the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were unable to sense this sort of air of arrogance. After all, they had all grown up here and had all no doubt gotten used to it.

However, outsiders were able to deeply sense that air of arrogance from this place. They knew right away that this was not a place where ordinary people could approach.

At this moment, both Hong Qiang and Tantai Xue were frowning. Evidently, they were not used to the atmosphere of this place.

Fortunately, Aunt Lian and the others were extremely hospitable to Chu Feng and the others. They treated them as honored guests. This caused the oppressive sensation that they felt to be lessened enormously.

However, even with this being the case, after Hong Qiang managed to improve his health, he immediately went to find Chu Feng and said that he had to leave. This was actually only a single day after they arrived at the Nangong Imperial Clan.

“Senior Hong Qiang, you really want to leave? Where do you plan to go?” Chu Feng was reluctant to part when he heard that Hong Qiang wanted to leave.

In the Overlord Domain, there were not a lot of people who he knew. Hong Qiang had protected him on this entire journey. Thus, Chu Feng already had very deep feelings for him. To Chu Feng, Hong Qiang was akin to being his relative. Now that his relative wanted to leave, he would naturally be reluctant to part.
