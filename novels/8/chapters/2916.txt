Chapter 2916 - The Crushing Defeat of the Holy Son

After Jinshi Bo made that gesture, the expressions of the people present all changed.

The reason for that was because the Black Crystal Stone that Song Yunfei had meticulously selected only cost eighty thousand Immortal Martial Stones.

However, the Black Crystal Stone that Jinshi Bo casually selected cost two hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones.

That was double the amount of their gambling stake.

Seeing this, Song Yunfei immediately started frowning.

The quality of the Black Crystal Stones here was somewhat guaranteed. Practically none of them would be worthless.

The Black Crystal Stone that Jinshi Bo had selected was over double the value of his. Furthermore, it could been seen with a single glance that that Black Crystal Stone was of decent quality too.

With this being the case, Song Yunfei felt that he would likely lose.

Were he to lose in terms of observational ability, then Song Yunfei would be able to bear it.

However, if he were to lose in terms of price, then Song Yunfei would feel extremely wronged.

No wonder. No wonder Jinshi Bo specifically requested that there be no price restriction. It turned out that he was planning to directly spend more money to purchase a higher quality Black Crystal Stone.

Song Yunfei was frowning tightly. He cursed in his heart at how treacherous this Jinshi Bo was. He made a resolution that he would definitely not be careless again.

After the two of them made their selection, the grey-haired old man started to cut their Black Crystal Stones. However, sure enough, Jinshi Bo’s Black Crystal Stone ended up containing a great amount of Immortal Martial Stone.

Jinshi Bo had indeed ended up winning this time.

"Miss Xia, didn’t I say it already, this senior brother of yours is inferior to me," Jinshi Bo said to Xia Yun’er very proudly after defeating Song Yunfei.

Faced with those words, Xia Yun’er revealed a faint smile on her face. However, she did not bother to respond.

No matter what, Song Yunfei was someone from their Starfall Holy Land, someone from the same power as herself. As such, Xia Yun’er would not admit that Song Yunfei was inferior to Jinshi Bo.

Furthermore, well-sighted individuals were all able to tell that while Xia Yun’er had a smile on her face, she should be feeling very disgusted with Jinshi Bo.

"Humph, to directly spend a greater sum to purchase a higher quality Black Crystal Stone, how could this be considered having actual skill?" Song Yunfei spoke in a very unreconciled manner.

"That is something you agreed to. Furthermore, when has the quality of Black Crystal Stones been decided by their size?"

"If it were that simple, there would simply be no use for Stone Gambling. Wouldn’t it do to just directly purchase a larger Black Crystal Stone? After all, one will definitely profit, and not suffer any financial losses," Jinshi Bo said mockingly.

"..."

Hearing those words, Song Yunfei revealed a furious look. However, he was at a loss as to how to refute Jinshi Bo. Thus, he could only say grudgingly, “Continue.”

This time around, Song Yunfei got more clever. He did not choose his Black Crystal Stone right away. Instead, he waited for Jinshi Bo to make his selection first.

Jinshi Bo made his selection very quickly. It was as if he were casually choosing a Black Crystal Stone.

That said, the Black Crystal Stone that he selected was also extremely expensive.

After Jinshi Bo made his selection, Song Yunfei also began to make his selection. He was once again meticulously choosing his Black Crystal Stone. That said, the Black Crystal Stone he selected this time was of an equal price to Jinshi Bo’s.

Song Yunfei felt that Jinshi Bo was someone who relied only on his wealth, and did not possess true ability.

He felt that with his eyesight, he would definitely be able to select a higher quality Black Crystal Stone than Jinshi Bo should he choose one of the same price.

“How could this be?!”

However, after the Black Crystal Stones were cut open, Song Yunfei immediately opened his mouth wide in shock.

The reason for that was because the Black Crystal Stone that he had meticulously selected was actually inferior to the one that Jinshi Bo had casually pointed at.

Song Yunfei was defeated once again.

“Did you really think that I’d only won against you because I chose a larger Black Crystal Stone?”

“Fool, what this prince relied on is this here,” Jinshi Bo pointed to his own eyes.

He was implying that his eyesight was better than Song Yunfei’s.

“Humph, just because I’ve let you win twice, you’ve already grown an exaggerated opinion of your abilities. I will have you know right away exactly what true ability is,” Song Yunfei said.

“Sure, let me witness exactly what sort of true ability you possess,” Jinshi Bo said indifferently.

Afterwards, the two men continued to confront one another ten more times. However, Song Yunfei ended up losing all ten times.

At that moment, the expressions that everyone looked at Jinshi Bo with had changed.

The crowd had already realized that this seemingly frivolous and lecherous youngest prince most definitely possessed true ability.

At the very least, he possessed some sort of unique ability in judging Black Crystal Stones.

“How is it? Are you still planning to continue?” Jinshi Bo asked as he looked to Song Yunfei.

At that moment, Song Yunfei was clenching his fists tightly with an embarrassed expression on his face. In fact, he who had always been haughty and arrogant actually lowered his head.

Song Yunfei had already lost a million two hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones to Jinshi Bo.

Although Song Yunfei had managed to obtain quite a few Immortal Martial Stones from the Black Crystal Stones, he had spent more in purchasing them.

After some calculations, Song Yunfei figured he had lost one million seven hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This was an enormous and unbearable amount for him.

Moreover, after contending against Jinshi Bo so many times, he had realized that Jinshi Bo was indeed superior to him in terms of judging Black Crystal Stones.

Even if he were to continue with the gamble against Jinshi Bo, the result would still be the same. He was indeed inferior to Jinshi Bo.

“What’s wrong, do you not dare to continue anymore? Are you cowering so quickly? What happened to your arrogance earlier?” JInshi Bo said mockingly.

“You!!!”

Song Yunfei’s face turned deathly white with anger after hearing his mockery. However, he was at a loss as to how to refute Jinshi Bo. All he could do was clench his tightly balled fists even tighter.

He had lost. The only thing he could do was admit it.

Jinshi Bo sighed and said to Xia Yun’er, “Miss Xia, didn’t I say it already, there’s no one in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm who could match you.”

“Young Master Jinshi, your skill in Stone Gambling is indeed extraordinary. However, I, Xia Yun’er, do not wish to find someone who is only proficient in Stone Gambling,” Xia Yun’er said.

“My, Miss Xia, I am also proficient in all kinds of other things. I am proficient in both world spirit techniques and the path of martial cultivation. Look at my martial cultivation.”

“To me, Stone Gambling is merely a minor interest. However, I am capable of mastering this minor interest of mine to such a degree. This illustrates how extraordinarily talented I am, no?” Jinshi Bo started to boast proudly.

Truth be told, seeing such an arrogant Jinshi Bo who continued to belittle the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm repeatedly, many of the people present were feeling disgusted with him.

After all, the great majority of the people present were from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. No one would like others insulting the world they were from.

Unfortunately, Jinshi Bo did indeed possess true ability. Even though he was arrogant and condescending, the crowd was unable to do anything about it.

“Since you regard yourself as having extraordinary gambling skill, why don’t you gamble with me?”

Right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard.

Hearing those words, the crowd were all startled. The reason for that was because the person that had spoken was none other than Chu Feng.

Had Chu Feng gone mad?

He was not even a match for Song Yunfei. Thus, how could he come out to gamble against Jinshi Bo?

Had he not witnessed how powerful Jinshi Bo was?

Even Song Yunfei had suffered a crushing defeat before Jinshi Bo!

Once Chu Feng stood forth, the crowd all started to frown. They were all unable to understand exactly what Chu Feng was thinking.

Jinshi Bo looked to Chu Feng disdainfully, and said mockingly, “You... weren’t you defeated by Song Yunfei? You failed to even win against him, yet you want to gamble with me?”

Before Chu Feng could say anything, Song Yunfei shook his head at Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, you should forget about it. With your bit of ability, it’s best to not make a show of yourself.”

“Song Yunfei, just because you were unable to win against him doesn’t mean that I too will not be able to win against him,” Chu Feng said.

“Humph. Chu Feng, I am only advising you against it because I don’t want you to lose in vain. Don’t be someone unable to recognize the good intentions of others. You failed to even win against me, yet you want to win against him? Are you delusional or what?” Seeing that Chu Feng did not appreciate his kindness, Song Yunfei immediately turned hostile, and began to mock Chu Feng unceasingly.

“Who said that I lost to you? Our gamble hasn’t ended yet. I will take care of him first, and then return to continue our gamble,” Chu Feng said to Song Yunfei.

“What arrogance. Very well, I will wait for you. However, it’s best that you retain some capital. Do not lose till you have nothing left,” Song Yunfei mocked.

“Rest assured, I will definitely not lose as miserably as you have,” Chu Feng said.
