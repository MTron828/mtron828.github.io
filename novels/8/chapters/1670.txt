MGA: Chapter 1670 - Severing The Connection

In the Nangong Imperial Clan. Nangong Tianlong, Nangong Tianhu, Nangong Tianshi and Nangong Tianfeng were gathered together.

After Chu Feng had beaten Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi and hung them upside down on top of a city gate naked, the four siblings all had their freedom restricted and were not allowed to take half a step outside of the Nangong Imperial Clan.

As they were trapped within their clan, the only thing that they were able to do, other than training, was drink and chat together.

These days, Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi had been living under Chu Feng’s shadow the entire time. They were extremely depressed and gloomy.

“You two, stop hanging your heads dispiritedly. Isn’t it only being hung upside down on the city gate by that Chu Feng? This matter has already been suppressed by our Imperial Father. No one will dare to spread it,” Nangong Tianlong comforted his brothers while smiling.

“Big brother, you don’t know. Being hung upside down on the city gate was merely being humiliated by Chu Feng. That was nothing serious. Our self-esteem is also not that weak.”

“The reason why we are feeling depressed is because the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword were snatched away by that Chu Feng.”

“After all, those two swords were obtained by Imperial Father through meticulous effort. He had bestowed the two swords to us; it meant that he was very fond of us and put a lot of trust in us.”

“But we... ended up losing them. We have truly let our Imperial Father down,” Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi said together.

“It’s merely two weapons, as long as the two of you are fine, what is there to worry about? You’ll be able to obtain good weapons again in the future.”

“Don’t forget, we four siblings are the successors to our Nangong Imperial Clan. The two of you are both going to be people who will shoulder great responsibility. Thus, do not continue to be tangled by something this small.”

“Furthermore, your connections with the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword are still there, no? This means that those two swords have already approved of you two as their masters.”

“Even if they are snatched away by Chu Feng, they are, in truth, still yours. Even though Chu Feng has obtained the two excellent swords, he is unable to use them. Thus, the one that should be depressed is him, no?” Nangong Tianlong said.

“That’s true. Even with the help of the Snow-haired Immortal, he has not been able to sever the relationship the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword have with us. This means that those two swords acknowledged the two of us. Else, it would impossible for even the Snow-haired Immortal to be unable to sever the connections.”

Speaking of this matter, Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi looked to one another and revealed proud smiles.

Back then, the White-browed Immortal had gone to personally capture Chu Feng. However, due to the interference of the Snow-haired Immortal, he had ended up failing to capture Chu Feng.

The White-browed Immortal had believed that the Snow-haired Immortal was Chu Feng’s backer.

And now, the White-browed Immortal had already returned to the Nangong Imperial Clan and mentioned what had happened that day to Nangong Beidou.

Thus, Nangong Tianlong and the others in the Nangong Imperial Clan all came to know that Chu Feng had the Snow-haired Immortal as his backer.

Who was the Snow-haired Immortal? She was one of the top existences among the Ten Immortals. In terms of both reputation and ability, she was not someone that the White-browed Immortal could compare with.

Thus, if the Snow-haired Immortal wanted to sever the connection to the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword had with Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi, it would be a very simple task.

And yet, so many days had passed and the connections were still there. There was only one possible explanation. That was, the two weapons had wholeheartedly acknowledged Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi as their masters. Thus, the connection between them was unable to be severed.

Even though this was a very unbelievable thing, it was something that had happened many times in the Holy Land of Martialism.

One of the most popular stories in the Holy Land of Martialism of something like this happening had been with a rank one Martial King. Even though his cultivation was very weak, he possessed a Royal Armament.

One day, his Royal Armament was snatched away. The person who snatched away his Royal Armament was not only a peak Half Martial Emperor, he was also a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. However, no matter how hard he tried, that peak Half Martial Emperor was unable to sever the connection between that rank one Martial King and the Royal Armament.

In the end, that peak Half Martial Emperor killed that rank one Martial King. Surprisingly, when that rank one Martial King died, the Royal Armament automatically perished alongside its master.

Thus, as the connections to the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword had with Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi were still present after all this time, it made them believe that the two swords had acknowledged them. That was why Chu Feng had been unable to obtain the two swords.

“Puu~~~”

Suddenly, Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi’s expressions changed enormously. Then, they vomited out blood and sat on the ground in a very weak manner.

They were in extremely weak health. It was as if they have been seriously injured by someone.

“Second brother, third brother, what happened to you two?”

“Second brother, third brother, are you alright?”

Nangong Tianlong and Nangong Tianfeng were both incomparably shocked and frightened upon seeing this scene. They immediately got up and lent their arms to support Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi.

As for Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi, their complexions turned green, and they became unable to speak.

“Exactly what happened? Why would the two of you vomit blood all of a sudden and become this weak?” Nangong Tianlong asked very worriedly. This matter was truly strange.

However, neither Nangong Tianhu nor Nangong Tianshi gave any reply. It was as if they had received an enormous shock; the two of them were sitting there with distracted expressions on their faces.

“Fourth sister, go and get the White-browed Immortal,” Feeling helpless, Nangong Tianlong instructed his younger sister.

“Mn,” Nangong Tianfeng did not hesitate. She immediately turned around and prepared to leave to find the White-browed Immortal.

“Big brother, there’s no need for that,” It was only upon hearing those words that Nangong Tianhu hurriedly spoke to stop Nangong Tianfeng.

“Second brother, exactly what has happened to you and third brother? Quickly, tell your big brother,” Nangong Tianlong asked urgently.

“It’s nothing, merely, my connection with the Cyan Rainbow Sword has been...” he sighed.

“It has been severed by someone. Likely, third brother, that’s what happened to you too, right?” Nangong Tianhu said in a very frustrated manner.

“Mn,” Nangong Tianshi nodded. He had the same sort of frustrated expression in his eyes.

“Oh you two, and here I was wondering what it was. With the Snow-haired Immortal present, the connections you two have with the two swords being severed is something that is bound to happen. There’s no need for you two to feel sad about this,” Nangong Tianlong comforted.

“Big brother, that’s not the case,” Nangong Tianhu raised his head. He looked to Nangong Tianlong and said, “At the moment when the connection between my Cyan Rainbow Sword and I was severed, I sensed a strand of aura. That aura was very familiar. It was Chu Feng’s aura.

“What do you mean by that? You’re saying... it was not the Snow-haired Immortal who severed your connection with the Cyan Rainbow Sword, that it’s Chu Feng who did it? How could that be?”

“After all, the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword’s acknowledgement of the two of you was all because of the White-browed Immortal’s spirit formation. No matter how strong Chu Feng might be, how could he possibly be able to break the White-browed Immortal’s spirit formation? It must definitely be the Snow-haired Immortal’s doing,” Nangong Tianlong had an expression of disbelief.

“Big brother, what second brother said is the truth. No matter how useless we are, we did, after all, obtain the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword before. Thus, our souls were connected with them.”

“Thus, we are able to determine with certainty who it is that severed our connections. It was indeed Chu Feng. We would not fail to recognize Chu Feng’s aura,” Nangong Tianshi said with a bitter smile. [1.Editors pointed out that Chu Feng’s aura had changed. True... not sure how they recognized his aura... oh wells. Bee just being Bee again, nothing new. **A reader pointed out that Chu Feng had put the spirit formation before his aura change. Thus, it explains why Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi knew it was Chu Feng.]

“......”

After hearing those words, both Nangong Tianlong and Nangong Tianfeng were stunned. It was as if they had been petrified. They were unable to say a single word. At this moment, they had extremely ugly and incomparably marvelous expressions on their faces.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
