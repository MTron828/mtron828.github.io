Chapter 3919 - The Same Sect

“I have a question. Did the power of the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond never change the entire time? Or was there a time when its power weakened substantially?” asked Chu Feng.

“Now that you speak of it, there was a time when its power weakened.”

“I’ve heard from my master that several hundred years ago, the power of the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond was extremely terrifying. At that time, we were simply unable to enter it, much less think about opening it.”

“The Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond was simply too terrifying then. It would’ve been impossible for us to open it.”

“However, one day, the power of the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond suddenly weakened. Furthermore, it did not weaken by just a little, but rather weakened substantially.”

“It is precisely because the power of the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond weakened that my master felt we would have the opportunity to open it,” as she spoke up till that point, Yin Zhuanghong’s expression suddenly changed. She asked, “Could it be that the treasures in the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond were removed at that time?”

“That’s very possible,” said Chu Feng.

“Then... exactly who removed the treasures?” Yin Zhuanghong’s brows narrowed.

“Who did it is no longer important. Don’t think about that anymore. The Ancient Era’s remnants do not belong to anyone anyways. Should one be strong enough, they’ll obtain them,” Chu Feng comforted.

The reason why he said those words was because he was able to tell that the Red-dress Holy Land had placed great importance on the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond.

However, what use was that?

At the time when the Red-dress Holy Land felt that it was simply impossible to open the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond, that person had removed all the treasures.

From that, it was obvious the person who had done so possessed strength far superior to the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond.

If the Red-dress Holy Land wanted to seek that person out, they’d only be asking for trouble.

“What you said is correct. However, I don’t know if my master and the various elders will be willing to let go of this matter like that. They’ve simply placed too much importance on this Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“Let’s consider those things if they can survive.”

As Chu Feng said those words, his brows narrowed.

The reason why Chu Feng reacted like that was because he discovered that the path was much longer than he had anticipated.

Even though he had obtained the power of the formation core, even though the formation core’s power was extremely strong and had increased his speed enormously, he was still unable to see his destination even when traveling at full speed.

Furthermore, the things Chu Feng could sense were very limited. Most of them were protective formations.

Chu Feng was unable to sense the current condition of the people from the Red-dress Holy Land.

However, he was able to sense a protective formation being attacked by outsiders. Chu Feng felt that that protective formation was most likely the one that the Red-dress Holy Land’s eldes were taking refuge in.

At that moment, the protective formation was on the verge of collapse.

Most importantly, even though Chu Feng had obtained the power of the formation core, he was not omnipotent. He was unable to strengthen that protective formation with his formation core’s power.

The only thing Chu Feng could do was rush over before the protective formation failed. Else, even if he possessed the power of the formation core, he would likely still be unable to save the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land.

“Rumble~~~”

“Rumble~~~”

“Rumble~~~”

Rumbles sounded nonstop.

A protective formation was currently sustaining intense attacks.

“Lady Supreme Elder, what are we to do?”

Frightened voices were sounding nonstop.

Unease, terror, fear, weeping cries and all sorts of other kinds of unpleasant moods filled the region.

It turned out that it was not only the Red-dress Holy Land’s elders that were there. Their disciples were also present.

When they discovered people being massacred, the Red-dress Holy Land realized that someone was gunning for their Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond. They believed that it was very likely the All-heaven Sect that was doing all the massacres.

If the All-heaven Sect was the one doing all this, they would definitely not only be planning to seize control of the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond. They would also eliminate their Red-dress Holy Land.

Because of that, the Red-dress Holy Land’s Supreme Elders decided to bring all of their elders and disciples into the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond to take refuge in the protective formation and wait for their Lady Headmaster’s return.

What they didn’t expect was that their opponents were not the All-heaven Sect. However, as they’d slaughtered innocent by the masses and gathered a great amount of Bloodsoul Aura, it made it so that even though their cultivations were not particularly powerful, their gathered Bloodsoul Aura was able to be utilized in the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond, and increased their power tremendously.

With a situation like that, even the protective formation was on the verge of collapse.

“It would appear that this is fate.”

The Red-dress Holy Land’s Supreme Elder had closed her eyes.

She had fallen into despair. She knew that even she would not be able to contend against those people.

The heavens wanted to ruin their Red-dress Holy Land. This was a fate she could not change.

“Rumble~~~”

Another loud rumble was heard, and the protective formation sheltering the Red-dress Holy Land’s elders and disciples finally shattered.

After the protective formation shattered, an army of over a hundred thousand appeared before the elders and disciples of the Red-dress Holy Land.

Those people were not from the All-heaven Sect. They all wore black gowns, and masks on their faces. Compared to the All-heaven Sect, they appeared even stranger.

Of course, if that were all, no one would be able to determine that they were not from the All-heaven Sect. After all, if the All-heaven Sect wanted to take care of them, they could very well disguise themselves.

The reason why the Red-dress Holy Land knew that they were not the All-heaven Sect was because their elders had fought them earlier. The abilities they used did not belong to the All-heaven Sect.

It would be one thing if it were only a single ability or two. Instead, all of them were using abilities that did not have any relation with the All-heaven Sect. Furthermore, their abilities were very similar to one another.

Everything indicated that they were from the same sect.
