Chapter 4649: Turning Into An Evil Spirit

“Eggy, is this really corpse water? That sounds disgusting,” Chu Feng asked.

“It definitely is. It’s impossible to mistake it for anything else,” Yu Sha affirmed Eggy’s judgment.

“Chu Feng, I don’t think that the Wretched Black Demon is a trustworthy individual. I advise you to find a way to get out of here,” Eggy said.

“It’s fine, Milady Queen. If he intends to do me harm, I have my own ways of escaping. The things inside the bathtub are all venomous, but it won’t cause any harm to my body. They’ll just cause my body to undergo some changes, though I’m not very certain what the changes are.

“Forget it, I’ll just give it a try then. The two of you, close your eyes and don’t look. I’m going to take off my clothes now.”

As Chu Feng said those words, he actually began to strip off his clothes. When it came to such physical tempering, the effects were best when one wasn’t clothed.

“Chu Feng, are you certain that it’s alright?”

Eggy was still worried about proceeding with this. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Rest assured. I’m a world spiritist, after all. I can at least discern what’s harmful to me.”

After taking off his clothes, Chu Feng took a look at the scroll the elder gave him and memorized the formation on it. He first set up the formation within his body before finally entering the bathtub.

Jip jip jip!

As soon as Chu Feng entered the bathtub, the worms inside unhesitatingly sunk their fangs into Chu Feng’s body, tearing his flesh and absorbing his blood.

Those worms carried lethal venom, and getting bitten by them was excruciating. To be attacked by a bathtub full of such worms was an absolute nightmare.

However, it was fortunate that the activation of the formation did alleviate the pain Chu Feng suffered. On top of that, he had also grown used to pain from all of the challenges he had been through, so this process was actually nothing much to him.

He made a slight frown at the very start, but the furrow swiftly unfurled. His leisurely expression made it seem as if he was just resting in a normal bathtub, cleansing himself.

Time ticked by, and soon Chu Feng noticed some things.

Firstly, the worms were there as a mediating reagent. The key to this bath was the corpse water. As the corpse water flowed into his body, it was mediated by the venom of the worms, inducing several changes to Chu Feng’s body.

Perhaps it was due to how relaxed Chu Feng was, not resisting the bites nor the inflow of corpse water at all, it took him less than 24 hours to absorb the energy within the bathtub.

The green fluid was no longer stinky, and the worms, perhaps due to excessively releasing their venom or the backlash of the corpse water, ended up dying off too.

“It’s done. Eggy and Yu Sha, you may open your eyes now. I’ve worn my clothes,” Chu Feng said.

The reason why he had to tell them that was because Eggy and Yu Sha could see what he saw. If he were to lower his gaze while changing his clothes, those two would be able to see his nether regions too. Due to that, he told them to close their eyes.

“Chu Feng, how are you feeling?” Eggy asked anxiously.

“I feel fine. I think I get what the Wretched Black Demon is up to here,” Chu Feng said.

“You know? So what do you think he’s up to then?” Eggy asked.

“Well, I can’t say for sure what his aim is, but the purpose of having him bathe inside this corpse water is so that I can enter the Asura Graveyard safely,” Chu Feng replied.

“What makes you think so?” Eggy asked curiously.

“Eggy, Yu Sha, the two of you should come out and feel it for yourself.”

As Chu Feng said those words, he quickly opened a spirit formation gate. Once Eggy and Yu Sha were out, he activated the formation in his body, and his eyes actually started emptying out. Black aura rose out from his empty eyes, making him look rather terrifying.

At the same time, his skin was starting to emanate slight bits of black aura too.

Most notably of all, however, his aura had changed too. He no longer felt like a human anymore.

His appearance and aura immediately made the truth apparent to both Eggy and Yu Sha.

“Your aura... That’s the aura of Asura Evil Spirits! So, the Wretched Black Demon was hoping to disguise you as an Asura Evil Spirit so that you can slip into the Asura Graveyard?” Eggy asked.

“I think so. However, I’m not too sure what exactly does he want me to do. I guess we’ll only know four hours later.”

Chu Feng’s heart was actually filled with anticipation at this very moment.

The very reason why he participated in this marriage convention, pushing ahead despite the risks of offending the Gongsun Clan, was not to marry the beautiful granddaughter of the Wretched Black Demon but to take a look at the Asura Graveyard.

Perhaps it was because he was an Asura World Spiritist, he found himself inexplicably drawn to the Asura Graveyard. This feeling of attraction appeared to poison his thoughts, growing stronger and stronger with each passing moment.

If he was just interested to visit the Asura Graveyard at the moment, right now, the Asura Graveyard had already turned into a place where he definitely had to go to. If he couldn’t go in to take a look, there was a good chance that he would spend the remainder of his life thinking about it.

Soon, 24 hours passed.

Before the elders could enter, Chu Feng had already walked out by himself. From the changes in Chu Feng’s aura, they could tell that he had completed the tempering process.

Satisfied smiles appeared on their faces, and their attitudes toward Chu Feng became much more respectful too.

Soon, Chu Feng was brought to an underground palace.

Opening the doors, he found himself faced before a long underground corridor that seemed to stretch on forever. There were lightstones hanging by the sides of the corridor, but the corridor was still rather dark.

As Chu Feng headed deeper down into the underground corridor, after passing through a few formation gates, he soon noticed a slight glow ahead of him. The further he proceeded, the brighter the glow.

Eventually, it became so bright that the whole corridor was lit up, almost blindingly even.

As it turned out, there was a massive formation at the very heart of the underground palace.

At the very heart of the underground palace was a considerably vast hall.

This hall was big enough to be passed off as a mini world, and there was a seemingly boundless formation floating in midair that spanned the entire size of this ‘mini world’.

It was so big that even a mountain range would appear measly before it.

Inside the hall, there was a square table with three seats placed around it. The Wretched Black Demon was seated at the main seat.

Upon seeing Chu Feng, the Wretched Black Demon responded with a smile. It would appear that he had been waiting for some time now.

“Young friend Chu Feng sure is punctual. However, I heard from the elders that you have already finished tempering four hours ago. Without a doubt, your talent far surpasses even that of Gongsun Yuntian. You have truly refreshed my impression of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. It looks like the Ancestral Martial Galaxy is going to make its name once more due to you.”

The Wretched Black Demon stood up and invited Chu Feng to take a seat.

The sheer level of respect he was according to Chu Feng was amazing, especially considering the Wretched Black Demon’s standing in the Nine Souls Galaxy.

However, what Chu Feng was more concerned about was the other information revealed in the Wretched Black Demon’s words.

The Wretched Black Demon actually knew that he had completed the tempering process four hours ago, which meant that Chu Feng had been under surveillance all this while.

After that, Chu Feng and Wretched Black Demon began chatting with one another, though the content mostly consisted of just pleasantries. In truth, they were just biding their time for Gognsun Yuntian’s arrival.

Fortunately, it didn’t take too long before Gongsun Yuntian arrived at this hall too.

Once Gongsun Yuntian got onto the seat, the doors to the hall finally closed, leaving just the three of them inside.

It was then that the Wretched Black Demon began revealing what the final trial was about.
