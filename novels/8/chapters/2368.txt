Chapter 2368 - Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone

On the way, Chu Feng had made many inquiries about the surrounding area. Thus, Chu Feng not only knew that the Hundred Refinements Stage was not far from the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond, he also knew the location of the Hundred Refinements Stage.

The mission that clay-like humanoid had given Chu Feng and Kong Cheng was very competitive.

Thus, Chu Feng did not dare to waste time. He had to proceed quickly for the Hundred Refinements Stage and strive to obtain the so-called Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone before Kong Zheng.

After all, that was the only way to save Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

“Mn?”

Right at the moment when Chu Feng was wholeheartedly hastening towards the Hundred Refinements Stage, his gaze abruptly changed. He immediately stopped mid-flight, and began to stare at the area ahead with a flabbergasted expression.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng discovered that there was a figure standing ahead, blocking his path. As for that person, it was actually his competitor, Kong Zheng.

“You were deliberately waiting for me here?” Chu Feng asked with an ill-natured tone. Chu Feng felt that it was very possible that Kong Zheng was deliberately waiting for him to take care of him.

After all, this Kong Zheng was hostile towards him earlier, and was his competitor now.

“Chu Feng, thank you for advising me earlier. Else, with how slow-witted I am, I fear that I would’ve killed my elder brother,” However, to Chu Feng’s surprise, not only did Kong Zheng not attack him, he instead clasped his hands and bowed to him in an apologetic manner.

“So it’s because of that. I felt that while your brother might possess a haughty temperament, his nature doesn’t seem to be bad. At the very least, he is affectionate and true towards you all. I do not wish for someone like him to die,” Chu Feng said.

“No matter what, it remains that I owe you a favor... and I will return this favor,” Kong Zheng said.

“It is a trivial manner, you don’t have to concern yourself with it,” Chu Feng said.

“What if I am able to bring you into the Hundred Refinements Stage?” Kong Zheng said.

“Bring me into the Hundred Refinements Stage?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s gaze immediately changed.

Actually, Chu Feng’s father had given him a world spirit key. His father had told Chu Feng that the world spirit key would allow him to exit the Hundred Refinements Stage. Chu Feng firmly believed in what his father said without the slightest bit of doubt.

However, his father had not mentioned to him whether or not the world spirit key could allow him to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage from the outside.

Although a spirit formation key like that would generally possess bilateral access, it remained that Chu Feng had never tried it before. As such, he did not possess absolute certainty of success.

Thus, Chu Feng was very worried. He feared that he would not even be able to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage.

Yet now, this Kong Zheng actually said that he would be able to bring Chu Feng into the Hundred Refinements Stage. To Chu Feng, this was an extremely enticing offer.

“You should know what sort of place the Hundred Refinements Stage is. Although that is the place where trash from the Lower Realms are transported to, the spirit formation of that place is extremely powerful. When the Hundred Refinements Stage is sealed, practically no one will be able to enter it.”

“In the past, there was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist who wanted to forcibly enter the Hundred Refinements Stage. However, he ended up being injured by the spirit formation around the Hundred Refinements Stage instead. No one was able to cure his injuries. Then, half a year later, he died,” Kong Zheng said.

“Based on what you said, doesn’t it mean that no one will be able to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course not. However, the clan in charge of guarding the Hundred Refinements Stage’s spirit formation is able to open the passage to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage,” Kong Zheng said.

“However, I’ve heard that the clan in charge of guarding the Hundred Refinements Stage’s spirit formation does not belong to any power. That clan has been guarding the Hundred Refinements Stage according to the rules of the Hundred Refinements Stage the entire time. For people like them, even if they are able to open up a passage to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage, they would not do so, no?”

“That is indeed the case. Even if you threaten them with their lives, they will likely still not submit to your demands.”

“However, my words possess a different significance. One of the Hundred Refinements Stage’s guardians was saved by my grandfather, and thus owes him an enormous favor.”

“He once declared that as long it was something he could accomplish, he would do any sort of task that was asked of him.”

“I was present at that time, and joked about whether or not he would be willing to allow me to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage to play around.”

“He told me that he would be willing to allow me to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage at any time.”

“Of course, I was merely saying those words. After all, I had no interest in entering a place where those trash from the Lower Realms trained.”

“Merely, I never expected that I would really need to enter that place today,” Kong Zheng said.

Although Kong Zheng was speaking to Chu Feng with a decent attitude right now, his tone was filled with arrogance. He greatly despised those from the Lower Realms.

“Right now, the relationship between us is that of competitors. If you are to help me enter the Hundred Refinements Stage, there will be no benefit for you. Instead, it will be extremely detrimental to you,” Chu Feng said.

“However, it remains that I owe you a favor. Only by doing this will I be able to express my sincerity. Only by doing this will this competition be fair. Furthermore, I do not feel that you will be able to defeat me,” Kong Zheng said.

“Never would I have expected that you were a man of character,” Faced with Kong Zheng’s behavior, Chu Feng revealed a good-natured smile.

Chu Feng was actually afraid that Kong Zheng might be plotting something. Thus, he had been observing Kong Zheng’s reaction the entire time. That said, Chu Feng felt that Kong Zheng was a slow-witted individual, and not someone proficient in putting up a pretense. If he was plotting something, Chu Feng felt that he would have been able to easily see through him.

However, Chu Feng saw nothing strange with Kong Zheng’s behavior. As such, Chu Feng was very surprised. After all, his initial impression of Kong Zheng was not good at all.

However, as Chu Feng found nothing strange with Kong Zheng’s behavior, it meant that Kong Zheng was really planning to help Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, let’s go,” As Kong Zheng spoke, he began to fly toward the direction of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Stage whilst Chu Feng followed closely behind him.

“Kong Zheng, do you know what use that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone possesses?” On the way there, Chu Feng asked out of curiosity. He felt that there was most definitely a reason why that mysterious existence wanted the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.

Upon mentioning the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, Kong Zheng’s expression had a clear change. Evidently, Kong Zheng knew the use of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.

“The Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone could be considered to be one of the Hundred Refinements Stage’s treasures. There is a legend regarding it.”

“According to that legend, the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was originally called the Ancient Era’s Sealing Stone. Not only does it possess enormous sealing power, it also possesses enormous unsealing power. Later on, when the Chu Heavenly Clan was constructing the Hundred Refinements Stage, they just so happened to need the Ancient Era’s Sealing Stone’s power. As such, they placed the Ancient Era’s Sealing Stone in the formation core of the Hundred Refinements Stage’s spirit formation,” Kong Zheng said.

“The Hundred Refinements Stage was constructed by the Chu Heavenly Clan?” Chu Feng asked in astonishment. He did not expect that the Hundred Refinements Stage was constructed by his clan.

“That’s right. Not only is the Chu Heavenly Clan the ruler of the Great Thousand Upper Realm, they are also the ruler of many Ordinary Realms and Lower Realms.”

“For the sake of managing the Lower Realms better, the Chu Heavenly Clan constructed the Hundred Refinements Stage in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. All the people from the Lower Realms end up arriving in that place,” Kong Zheng said.

“Since the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is that important, wouldn’t we destroy the Hundred Refinements Stage should we take it away?” Chu Feng asked.

“We wouldn’t. Reportedly, the Ancient Era’s Sealing Stone was originally black in color, and contained enormous power.”

“However, after it was used by the Hundred Refinements Stage, the Ancient Era’s Sealing Stone had already had all of its power completely drawn out. After all of the Ancient Era’s Sealing Stone’s powers were drawn out, it turned green in color, like jadeite. That was why it became known as the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.”

“And now, the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is no longer in the Hundred Refinements Stage’s spirit formation’s formation core. Instead, it was placed on the Hundred Refinements Stage’s altar. That was also the reason why I was surprised that that thing would want that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. I truly cannot understand why it would want it,” Kong Zheng said.

“Indeed,” Hearing what Kong Zheng said, Chu Feng started to ponder.

“Heh...” Right at the moment when Chu Feng was pondering, the corners of that Kong Zheng’s mouth suddenly rose into a wicked curve.
