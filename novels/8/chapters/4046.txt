Chapter 4046 - Fooling Everyone

“It would appear that you possess some sort of treasure on you again.”

“Is it still the same treasure you used to suppress the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief?” asked Wuming Doutian.

Even though he already knew that Chu Feng possessed the power to restrict the Dragon City Envoy, he remained completely calm, composed and filled with confidence.

At the same time as he was devising a battle plan against Chu Feng, he fully revealed his contempt for him as well.

“Heh...” Chu Feng let out a faint chuckle. “Why don’t you come give it a try since you want to know so badly?”

“Putting on a mystifying show.” Wuming Doutian snorted in contempt. “Chu Feng, do you really think we fled because we were afraid of the Linghu Heavenly Clan?”

“Do you really think that we’ve returned to reap the harvest not sown by us now that the Linghu Heavenly Clan has been beaten back?”

“If that’s what you believe to be the case, then you’re truly looking down on our Wuming Clan.”

“I, Wuming Doutian, am absolutely not a coward.”

“Boom~~~”

After saying those words, boundless oppressive might exploded out from Wuming Doutian.

The oppressive might was extremely powerful. It instantly filled the surroundings and enveloped everyone present.

Upon sensing the oppressive might, the expressions of everyone present changed enormously.

They were all able to sense how powerful Wuming Doutian’s oppressive might was.

Wuming Doutian’s cultivation had reached a whole new level.

Even if the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was present, he would still not be a match for him.

The reason for that was because Wuming Doutian’s cultivation was that of a rank three Utmost Exalted!

“Rank three Utmost Exalted, Lord Realm Master’s cultivation has actually increased again.”

“So powerful. As expected of Lord Realm Master. Even if the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief were here, he would still be unable to contend against Lord Realm Master.”

“Turns out, he didn’t flee from the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Rather, he had entered closed-door training.”

“He was planning to return to take care of the Linghu Heavenly Clan once his cultivation increased.”

“Sure enough, Lord Realm Master is, in the end, still the starfield’s overlord. Everything is within his grasp.”

“Whilst the Linghu Heavenly Clan has been beaten back, even if they hadn’t been beaten back, and had instead seated themselves on the overlord seat, they would still definitely be no match for the Wuming Clan. Sooner or later, they would have been defeated.”

After sensing the oppressive might, the surrounding crowd burst into a complete uproar again. The people from the various powers all began to discuss spiritedly.

However, one thing was unanimous -- they were all praising Wuming Doutian.

It was only at that moment that they realized that the Wuming Clan’s escape back then was actually a strategic retreat.

They had not conceded to the Linghu Heavenly Clan. In fact, they even possessed the power to recapture everything that they’d lost.

This was fully validated by Wuming Doutian’s current cultivation.

After sensing Wuming Doutian’s cultivation, the crowd all turned their eyes to Chu Feng.

They wanted to watch Chu Feng humiliate himself.

They were thinking that if Wuming Doutian was still a rank two Utmost Exalted, then Chu Feng, with how he’d been able to defeat the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief back then, might really have been able to take him on.

However, Wuming Doutian’s cultivation was now that of a rank three Utmost Exalted.

How was Chu Feng supposed to respond to that?

“Chu Feng, a wise man submits to circumstances.”

“Taking your grandfather and father into consideration, as long as you hand over the invitation letter now, I can disregard your behavior as being the ignorance of a person of the younger generation,” Wuming Doutian said to Chu Feng.

He was immensely pleased with himself.

He believed that, after revealing his current cultivation, victory was already in his grasp.

“Heh...”

Chu Feng let out a light chuckle after hearing those words.

Then, he waved his sleeve.

“Boom~~~”

Following a loud noise, boundless oppressive might swept forth from Chu Feng’s body.

At that moment, Wuming Doutian, the Dragon City Envoy and everyone else were all astonished.

It turned out that Chu Feng’s cultivation had also reached rank three Utmost Exalted.

This had surpassed everyone’s expectations.

Chu Feng was a person of the younger generation; how could he possibly possess a rank three Utmost Exalted-level cultivation?

This progress in cultivation was simply too fast.

After all, when Chu Feng had fought against the Linghu Heavenly Clan, he’d been relying on a treasure.

Yet, the oppressive might he displayed at that moment was so very real. That aura was none other than his own.

As such, it did not seem like the power of a treasure at all. Rather, it seemed like Chu Feng’s actual cultivation had reached rank three Utmost Exalted.

To the crowd, this was simply too terrifying of a thing.

After all, Chu Feng was still only a person of the younger generation. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

A person of the younger generation actually possessed such a powerful cultivation? That was simply something that no one would have dared imagine.

Chu Feng had surpassed the capabilities of a person of the younger generation. He had gained the strength to contend for the position of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s strongest individual.

In fact, if it wasn’t for Wuming Doutian’s increase in cultivation, the current Chu Feng would be the strongest existence in the Ancestral Martial Starfield apart from Long Daozhi.

At that moment, the crowd suddenly felt ashamed.

It turned out that they had misunderstood Chu Feng.

His confidence was not from using his position to bully others. Nor was it because he possessed an exaggerated opinion of his own abilities.

Rather, it was because he truly possessed the means, the qualification, to be so confident.

As for his qualification, it was his rank three Utmost Exalted-level cultivation.

“Too amazing. This is simply too amazing.”

“How can there be a person this terrifying? It’s only been how long since he was last seen, yet he’s actually already become an Utmost Exalted-level expert? Furthermore, he’s a rank three Utmost Exalted?”

“He has surpassed his grandfather and father. The discarded child from back then has grown up to be the strongest genius in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, and is standing at the apex.”

When discussions regarding Chu Feng sounded again, they were no longer voices of contempt. Rather, they were all praises and exclamations.

Chu Feng had won over the crowd with his strength again.

Regardless of whether they were people that liked him or people that disliked him, they all had no choice but to recognize his strength.

“Unimaginable. Truly unimaginable.”

It was not only the bystanders. Even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was endlessly excited.

In fact, glistening teardrops were present in his aged eyes.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was not the only person with such a reaction.

Many Chu Heavenly Clansmen were already sobbing nonstop.

The series of events that had happened earlier was simply too stifling.

When facing the Wuming Clan and Ancestral Martial Dragon City, those two giant mountains, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen did not even have the strength to resist. They were suppressed to a state of being unable to breathe.

Furthermore, they were endlessly afraid. Their opponents were simply too powerful. Should they provoke them in the slightest, they could potentially suffer a disaster where their entire clan would be wiped out.

Because of that, when Chu Feng went against the Wuming Clan and Ancestral Martial Dragon City, many Chu Heavenly Clansmen were so terrified that they had nearly fainted.

Many were even blaming Chu Feng and thinking that he shouldn’t be so impulsive. After all, his actions would implicate them.

It was only that moment they came to a realization.

It turned out that Chu Feng had a card up his sleeve from the very start.

He had grown to a level where he could back up their entire Chu Heavenly Clan all on his own.

That said, what the crowd didn’t know was that Chu Feng’s cultivation was actually still only that of an Exalted.

In his martial cultivation, Chu Feng was still far away from reaching rank three Utmost Exalted.

Chu Feng’s current cultivation was a disguise put forth through the use of his world spirit techniques.

Chu Feng did not wish to reveal the fact that he was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

If he were to reveal that, there would inevitably be people who would associate him with Asura.

If his identity as Asura was exposed, he might end up implicating the Chu Heavenly Clan and his friends.

That was why he had deliberately disguised himself as a rank three Utmost Exalted using his world spirit techniques.

He was trying to pull the wool over the crowd’s eyes.
