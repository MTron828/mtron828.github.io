Chapter 5904: The Sacred Treasure is a Demon God?

The Darkness Monstrous God was a legendary entity in the Immemorial Era. It was said to possess the ability to control space, and it had the power to easily obliterate a starfield.

Chu Feng had once seen its shell. It towered over tens of millions of meters high, making it the biggest thing he had seen other than the nine lightning beasts, and this was considering that the lightning beasts were inside him whereas the Darkness Monstrous God’s shell was outside.

He could never forget the pressure he felt from it.

He called it a shell because it had lost all traces of life, making it a dead entity. Nevertheless, it still harnessed devastating energy and terrifying spatial energy.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist used the remaining power in the Darkness Monstrous God to construct a teleportation formation that spanned many starfields and realms in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. This teleportation formation far surpassed the ancient teleportation formation.

However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist also said that the Darkness Monstrous God’s shell was extremely dangerous, and he should avoid borrowing too much of its power. This could be seen from how the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had only used an insignificant amount of its power despite having constructed such a powerful teleportation formation.

If the shell was already this powerful, the claims that the complete Darkness Monstrous God could easily destroy starfields was probably no exaggeration.

“Elder, could the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s sacred treasure be the sealed soul of the Darkness Monstrous God?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s likely to be the case,” the Divine Deer replied.

“Elder, you’re more knowledgeable. Please help me analyze the situation,” Chu Feng said.

“The Darkness Monstrous God is a legend. I have only seen the painting, so I can’t confirm anything. You should decide for yourself what’s the truth. However, you should proceed with caution if you decide that’s really the Darkness Monstrous God’s soul. Even the Three Saints Monstrous Clan would have been at risk of being obliterated dealing with an entity like that even when it was at its peak, let alone in its current state.

“Ah, you shouldn’t tell the Three Saints Monstrous Clan about your deduction yet since you aren’t sure about it yet. It’s best to be guarded,” the Divine Deer said.

“Elder, thank you for the reminder. Do you sense any powerful existences lingering around us? I’m wondering if the sacred treasure is still lingering in the sacred mountain?” Chu Feng asked.

However, the Divine Deer didn’t answer.

“Elder, why don’t we chat a bit longer? There’s no need to be so lofty,” Chu Feng pressed on, believing that the Divine Deer, with its incredible means, would be of help to him.

However, the Divine Deer still didn’t answer.

“Chu Feng, what’s wrong?” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly spoke up. From his point of view, Chu Feng had fallen into a daze after seeing the black jars.

“Nothing much. It’s just that I sense a dangerous aura in the vicinity.” Chu Feng heeded the Divine Deer’s suggestion and refrained from revealing his suspicions to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. “Does your Three Saints Monstrous Clan have more records on the sacred treasure?”

“I’m afraid not.” The clan chief shook his head.

“This sacred treasure is likely to be a formidable entity. Has nothing happened since it escaped from the Sacred Temple?” Chu Feng asked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I don’t think so. Everything has been normal in our clan since we discovered the disappearance of the sacred treasure,” the clan chief replied.

Chu Feng spent a moment observing the Sacred Temple, but he couldn’t gather any other clues. There was a time limit to the Sacred Temple, so Chu Feng and the others were evicted from it after some time.

The Sacred Temple vanished, and a fog enveloped the sacred mountain once more.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief felt indignant. His true goal here was to obtain the sacred mountain’s energy so that he could unravel the barrier trapping them, thus bringing their clansmen out of this realm.

Yet, he didn’t receive the energy despite Chu Feng learning the final formation.

This left him confused and indignant. This meant he would have to find an alternative solution to bring his clansmen out of this place.

As for the legacy they had received, they needed some time to make sense of it, but it provided them with some hope. Perhaps the legacy was the key for them to escape from this place.

Just as Chu Feng and the others were descending from the Sacred Temple, a surge of teleportation energy suddenly enveloped Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng!!!” Zi Ling anxiously reached out to grab Chu Feng, but she was too late.

Chu Feng vanished with the teleportation energy.

“Don’t worry, it’s a good thing. He has been chosen by the Sacred Temple, so I reckon he was teleported in there,” the clan chief replied.

Zi Ling heaved a sigh of relief.

“Father, why was Chu Feng the only one teleported there even though we challenged the formation together with Chu Feng?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“I challenged the formation together with Chu Xuanyuan, but he was the only one brought into the Sacred Temple too,” the clan chief replied.

“I get it now. Only the person with the greatest contribution is qualified to enter the Sacred Temple.” Sansheng Qiutian widened his eyes in realization.

“You little... That’s not necessarily the case. Chu Feng contributed more than the lot of you, but I was equal to Chu Xuanyuan,” the clan chief replied.

“That’s true. There must be another reason behind this,” Sansheng Qiutian said. He wanted to get to the bottom of this matter.

Moments later, his eyes lit up. “I get it! Only outsiders have been able to enter the Sacred Temple. It might be an additional reward to outsiders for helping us breach our formations.”

“Now that you mention it, that might be the case,” the clan chief replied.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had been brought into the Sacred Temple’s formation space.

He didn’t sense it earlier, but now that he was inside this formation space, he realized that he had unknowingly gathered the sacred mountain’s energy earlier, and he could sense how much he had gathered now too. This gave him an idea of what he could exchange for.

There were all sorts of items here—martial skills, weapons, cultivation techniques, cultivation resources, treasures, and so on. He was free to select whatever he liked too, so he made sure to check everything first.

First and foremost, he gave up on all cultivation resources, as those weren’t suited for him. That was probably the reason his father didn’t choose the cultivation resources too.

Similarly, the martial skills weren’t particularly strong, and the weapons were at most low-quality God Armaments.

In contrast, there were good treasures available here, including recovery ones, and they were of high quality.

In the end, he picked three items from the treasures.
