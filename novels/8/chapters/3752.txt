Chapter 3752 - A Gargantuan Joke?

“Linghu Zhishi, you are despicable to the extreme!!!”

“Someone like you is not qualified to be the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield! You are not qualified!!!”

Suddenly, Chu Xuanzhengfa let out a furious shout.

Following him, many other Chu Heavenly Clansmen also began to curse out the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

However, their curses appeared very powerless. In fact, the people of the Linghu Heavenly Clan were not at all angered.

They looked at the Chu Heavenly Clansmen like they were a bunch of clowns.

They knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan simply could not contend against them. The disparity in strength between them was simply too enormous.

Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen could only attack them using words.

However, this sort of resistance was very powerless...

“Clan Chief Linghu, don’t forget that Linghu Hongfei is still here.”

“I’m assuming that you do not want him to live?”

Right at that moment, Gu Mingyuan spoke. As she spoke, she captured Linghu Hongfei who was lying on the ground and grabbed him by the neck, lifting him up.

“That’s true. Linghu Hongfei is in their hands.”

“With such a hostage, would the Linghu Heavenly Clan dare do anything?”

Seeing that scene, the crowd came to a sudden realization.

After all, they all knew how important Linghu Hongfei was to the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

In the eyes of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, all the lives of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen would not be able to replace the life of Linghu Hongfei alone.

Thus, if the Chu Heavenly Clan was to take Linghu Hongfei as a hostage, they might really end up being able to escape.

“Hahaha...”

However, to everyone’s surprise, Linghu Zhishi laughed at Gu Mingyuan’s threat.

He was laughing with great pleasure. Not only was he very pleased with himself, but his laughter was also filled with ridicule.

He laughed for a very long time before finally stopping. Then, he looked at Gu Mingyuan.

“Gu Mingyuan, look carefully at who it is you’re holding in your hand,” said Linghu Zhishi.

“This!!!”

Hearing those words, the crowd immediately looked over at Gu Mingyuan’s hand.

Upon doing so, the expressions of Gu Mingyuan and everyone present changed enormously.

The person Gu Mingyuan was holding at that moment was clearly not Linghu Hongfei. Instead, it was someone else, who was completely covered in blood. That person had been mutilated beyond recognition.

However, on this person’s waist was the title plate of the Chu Heavenly Clan. That person... was someone of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Furthermore, that person had already died.

Judging from his appearance, he had just died.

“How could this be?”

The crowd were all completely baffled by the scene before them.

It was clearly Linghu Hongfei that Chu Feng had seriously injured earlier.

Linghu Hongfei was lying there and screaming in pain the entire time.

Even when Gu Mingyuan captured him, Linghu Hongfei had stilled looked exactly the same.

Thus, why would he suddenly turned into a Chu Heavenly Clansman?

“Chu Feng, you will definitely pay for what you’ve done!”

Suddenly, a gnashing voice filled with killing intent was heard.

The crowd saw that a figure had walked out behind Linghu Zhishi.

It was that person that had said those words. As for that person, he was actually Linghu Hongfei.

Merely, the current Linghu Hongfei looked different from before.

He had changed into clothes without blood. Even the wounds on his face had disappeared.

However, his eyes were covered in gauze, and one could still see two bloodstains beneath the white gauze.

This meant that Linghu Hongfei was indeed seriously injured, and had his eyes blinded by Chu Feng.

Replaced with a fake!!!

Seeing the current Linghu Hongfei, the crowd came to a sudden realization.

Before all those people, the Linghu Heavenly Clan had managed to rescue Linghu Hongfei and treat his injuries while Linghu Zhishi was exchanging words with the Chu Heavenly Clan.

That said, this made the crowd realize that the injuries to Linghu Hongfei’s eyes seemed to be rather serious.

After all, even after Linghu Hongfei’s injuries were treated, his eyes were still injured. He had truly lost his sight.

“Gu Mingyuan, you’re a failure of an Utmost Exalted. You actually didn’t discover us replacing Hongfei before your eyes. You actually used a corpse from the Chu Heavenly Clan to threaten me?”

“Gu Mingyuan, you’ve truly disappointed me,” Linghu Zhishi mocked.

Sure enough, Linghu Hongfei had been replaced by the Linghu Heavenly Clan only a short while before.

It was no wonder they were so confident.

“Linghu Zhishi, do you really think that you’re definitely going to win?”

“You shouldn’t be taking glee so quickly.”

As Gu Mingyuan spoke, she flipped her palm, and a total of ten medicinal pellets appeared in her hand.

All ten medicinal pellets were forbidden medicines. Furthermore, they were extremely powerful forbidden medicines.

Those forbidden medicines all possessed very terrifying backlashes. If Gu Mingyuan were to devour all ten forbidden medicines at once, she would undoubtedly die. No one would be able to save her.

Upon seeing the ten forbidden medicines, everyone knew that she was planning to risk her life.

“Mother!”

Chu Lingxi was standing right beside Gu Mingyuan. Tears emerged in her eyes.

She knew what her mother was planning to do. However, she was powerless to stop her.

After all, they would all be killed anyways. Thus, if they were to risk their lives to fight, then perhaps they might have a chance of survival. If they were to give in to fate, then only death awaited them.

Chu Lingxi understood that principle. However, it remained that Gu Mingyuan was her mother.

Seeing her mother’s intention to fight to the death, Chu Lingxi was unable to contain the grief in her heart.

“Go ahead and take them. Let me experience exactly how powerful those forbidden medicines of yours are," said Linghu Zhishi.

Linghu Zhishi had no intention to stop Gu Mingyuan. Even though he knew that she was planning to put up a life and death struggle, he still did not place her in his eyes at all.

“I’ll satisfy you!”

Determination appeared in Gu Mingyuan’s eyes. She raised her hand with the intention to swallow the forbidden medicines.

“Paa~~~”

However, right after Gu Mingyuan raised her hand, a hand grabbed her wrist, stopping her.

It was Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, don’t attempt to dissuade me. At a time like this, this is the only thing that can be done," Gu Mingyuan said to Chu Feng.

“Senior, I understand what you’re feeling. However... there’s actually no need for all this," said Chu Feng.

“No need for all this?”

Chu Feng’s words not only confused Gu Mingyuan, but they also puzzled the others present.

However, at the time when the crowd were all confused, Chu Feng made another action.

This action of his was even more shocking.

Chu Feng turned his gaze to the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.

His gaze landed on all of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen present.

After examining them with his gaze, Chu Feng finally spoke, “Let’s talk about the unpleasant things first. If you all are to leave now, there will still be a margin for discussion.”

“However, if you are to continue to stay, then you will truly be making an enemy out of our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Toward enemies, I, Chu Feng... will never show leniency.”

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, the surroundings grew completely quiet.

Although the surroundings had grown quiet, the crowd’s hearts were unable to calm down.

It was like there was unending thunder exploding in the crowd’s ears.

The crowd all felt that their ears had malfunctioned.

The reason for that was because they were unable to believe what they’d just heard.

Just then, Chu Feng seemed to have threatened the Linghu Heavenly Clan?

But, how was Chu Feng qualified to make that threat?

“Hahahaha!!!”

Suddenly, deafening laughter exploded.

All of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were laughing with great delight. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The crowd was capable of understanding why they would laugh.

Chu Feng’s words were akin to a little rabbit telling a bunch of wolves that he would eat them.

That was indeed ridiculous and laughable.

“Chu Feng, you are truly capable of cracking jokes.”

“What’s this? Are you trying to relieve your nervousness?” mocked Linghu Zhishi.

Chu Feng acted as if he did not hear Linghu Zhishi’s mocking words.

His expression remained unchanged facing the mocking laughter of the Linghu Heavenly Clan. He was completely unaffected.

He said, “It would appear that no one is planning to leave. Since that’s the case, all of you can die here.”
