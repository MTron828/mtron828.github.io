MGA: Chapter 890 - The Holy Daughter Appears

“Ahh, this Murong Xun uses such sinister demonic techniques to absorb so many experts’ cultivation and life, yet he is still no match for Chu Feng. His time has truly gone. His current title of number one genius is fated to leave.”

“Yeah! The distance between them is really too big, and that’s not only in terms of strength and aptitude. In many other places, Murong Xun is far inferior to Chu Feng!”

At that moment, not only was there no one who helped Murong Xun, there were even many who discussed secretly amongst themselves, jabbing at his pains and criticized everything about him.

That made Murong Xun, who already had a stomach filled with anger, even more enraged. He roared, “You dare to talk about me like this? Who the hell do you think you are?!

“You trash! I didn’t invite you here to slander my Immortal Execution Archipelago! I give you a good treatment, but you reject it. What use do you have now then? Go die!”

Murong Xun suddenly roared. The blood-red aura was akin to a fierce beast as it, amidst a strange sound and horrifying might, burst out from his body again, instantly engulfing all the observers at that location.

“AHH—”

At that instant, all sorts of painful cries rang continuously. Those who were enveloped by the blood-red aura all felt so much pain they wished they were dead as their howls reached even the heavens.

The demonic technique Murong Xun used right now wasn’t simply just absorbing a portion of their cultivation and life. It was completely refining their life and cultivation—he was killing them.

As they were absorbed so heartlessly, all of them, from undamaged bodies, became persons of blood as they were horrifically mangled. In the end, they became pools of blood—they were all cleanly engulfed by Murong Xun, and died without a complete corpse.

“This dammed Murong Xun, he’s actually this cruel...”

When they saw such a scene, nearly everyone’s expression changed greatly. Their feelings of anger sprang up coincident with indescribable uneasiness and fear as all those emotions flooded their hearts because they knew, today, they were going to face a disaster.

“Immortal Execution Archipelago, attention! Kill all these outsiders who ignore our kindness. Leave none alive!” the Sixth Immortal ordered. Indeed, as the saying went, “whatever one worries is whatever will happen”—the Sixth Immortal worried about killing the observers, and that was the exact thing that happened.

“Yes sir!” Everyone from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, after hearing his words, revealed their killing intent. They cast their gazes full of bloodlust towards the fearful-faced observers who were scattered outside the battlefield.

“Run! The Immortal Execution Archipelago are planning to silence us!”

At that instant, the observers had already confirmed death was nearing them. As they cursed the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s various vile acts, they escaped for their lives. They wanted to search for a chance of escape within the chaos.

However, how could the Immortal Execution Archipelago give them that chance? Seeing that typical Martial Lords could not catch up to those observers, the Sixth Immortal emanated his aura of Martial King to deter everyone. He was personally going to kill those who were witness to Murong Xun’s usage of demonic technique.

He was going to kill them all in order to prevent them from spreading this news!

“Some Immortal Execution Archipelago this is! You aim to silence them after your wicked acts are revealed? Is this the famous upright clan that rids evil and guards righteousness?”

But just as the Sixth Immortal prepared to eradicate them all, a woman’s voice suddenly rang out. At the same time, a white-clothed beautiful figure soundlessly appeared before the observers, and stopped the Sixth Immortal and the others’ path.

Most importantly, after she appeared, she emanated an aura no weaker than the Sixth Immortal’s. It was the aura of a rank one Martial King, and naturally, that person was Qiushui Fuyan.

“Who are you?” the Sixth Immortal loudly questioned as he tightly furrowed his brows at her sudden emergence. His expression changed slightly when he faced this rank one Martial King, and did not make any rash movements.

In reality, the Sixth Immortal was not the only one who had such a reaction. Almost everyone’s expression changed greatly as they couldn’t help but cast their gazes at that woman.

At this moment, of nearly all Martial Lords, Chu Feng was invincible. Even Murong Xun was no match for Chu Feng, and likely even if all Martial Lords from the Immortal Execution Archipelago attacked at the same time, they would still do nothing to Chu Feng.

So, in terms of Martial Lords, even though the ones from the Crippling Night Demon Sect and in addition to the observers from many parts of the Eastern Sea Region were inferior in number to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, their strength was superior.

On the other hand, in terms of Martial Kings, the Immortal Execution Archipelago not only had the Sixth Immortal, they also had the two Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan. Yet, the Crippling Night Demon Sect only had the Water King and Fire King. No matter strength or numbers, they were inferior to the Immortal Execution Archipelago.

And since a Martial King’s strength was superior to all—it was simply not an existence a Martial Lord could fight against—everyone felt for today’s battle, the Immortal Execution Archipelago grasped the ticket to victory. If they truly decided to kill them all, then the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the observers would all die.

Yet, right now, another rank one Martial King appeared, and judging by aura, that person’s strength was very powerful as well, an existence no weaker than the Sixth Immortal.

If that woman was from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, then the absolute disadvantage they had would not only equal out, there was even the possibility of it becoming an advantage. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

That person’s appearance was of utmost importance. It was related to the outcome of this battle.

So, who that woman was and which side she stood on became the most crucial part. That was why everyone looked at her without shifting their gazes.

Qiushui Fuyan did not directly respond to their gazes and the Sixth Immortal’s question. Instead, she raised her hand, and slowly lifted her veil. She showed her beautiful appearance that did not diminish over the years right in front of everyone.

“Yo-you’re Qiushui Fuyan?!

After the Sixth Immortal saw her complexion, his expression changed greatly. His calm face could remain collected no longer.

He had thought of countless possibilities, but her being Qiushui Fuyan was one he didn’t think of.

“What? Qiushui Fuyan? Which Qiushui Fuyan? The Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church? The former number one beauty of the Eastern Sea Region?”

“Rubbish! How many Qiushui Fuyans can there be in the Eastern Sea Region? Both this shocking appearance, and powerful strength, confirms without a doubt that this is the Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church!”

“But, but... hasn’t everyone from the Burning Heaven Church relocated to the Holy Land of Martialism?”

At that instant, not to mention the Sixth Immortal, nearly everyone’s faces changed greatly. They were all dumbfounded, and with faces full of shock, they examined the lithe Qiushui Fuyan. They felt this was not reality, that this was inconceivable.

No one would have thought they would still see the Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church whose name was known throughout the world.

However, when she appeared so alive before their eyes, they could only feel shock and nothing else.
