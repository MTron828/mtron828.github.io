Chapter 4534 - Time For Me To Act

“Long Ning, don’t be so worried. Your father is going to win soon,” Chu Feng said to Long Ning.

But, Long Ning was already completely enraged by Chu Feng. She simply does not wish to even bother to pay attention to him.

Furthermore, as her cultivation was limited, she was unable to determine what was actually happening in the battle before her.

But, she was still worried for her father. As such, she had no choice but to seek out guidance from the experts of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

“Lord Elders, how is the battle progressing?” asked Long Ning.

“Lord City Master is dominating the battle more and more. Soon, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster will be defeated,” said an expert from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

Hearing that sort of reply, Long Ning’s suspended heart was eased greatly.

Her father was the current foundation of their Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

Even though they offended the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, they could, if worst comes to worst, flee. As long as her father comes out alright, things would all be fine.

“How could this be?”

Soon, the experts from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City all began to frown.

“What’s wrong? What’s happening? Lord Elders, what happened?”

Seeing their reaction, Long Ning immediately inquired nervously.

“That Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster seemed to be hiding his strength. His strength increased all of a sudden. Currently, Lord City Master is forced onto defense,” said the experts of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

“Ah?”

Long Ning clenched her fists upon hearing those words. She grew so nervous her body started shivering.

“He didn’t conceal his strength. He took a forbidden medicine. Those people of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect are truly despicable. It would appear that it’s time for me to act.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he began to walk toward the battle.

“Young friend Chu Feng, what are you doing? Don’t go over there.”

Seeing Chu Feng walking toward the battle, the experts of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City immediately stepped forward to stop him. They wanted to drag him back.

While they were angry at Chu Feng, they only blamed him for his willfulness leading to the current situation befalling their Ancestral Martial Dragon City. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

They knew that Long Daozhi regarded Chu Feng very highly. As such, they would not allow for Chu Feng to do anything dangerous.

For the sake of stopping Chu Feng, they even reached out with their very hands to prevent him from proceeding. Some even unleashed their oppressive mights to seal Chu Feng’s movements.

“Woosh---”

But, to their surprise, Chu Feng’s body shifted slightly and, like a phantom, disappeared before them.

The experts of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City gave their all to stop Chu Feng. Yet, they failed.

This scene utterly astonished the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Wuming Doutian and others.

But, the very next moment, even the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect were completely astonished.

Turned out, the battle between Long Daozhi and the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster stopped.

After they stopped fighting, the energy ripples of their battle started to dissipate. Because of that, the crowd were finally able to see the progress of the battle in the sky.

But, upon seeing it, the crowd discovered that the reason for the intense battle to stop was because a person had entered the battlefield.

As for that person, he was someone recognized by all the people present -- the person that they felt to not know the immensity of heaven and earth, Chu Feng.

Chu Feng not only entered the battlefield, he was even standing before the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster.

Chu Feng’s arm was raised. It blocked the blade the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster hacked down.

From his movement and posture, if Chu Feng didn’t stop the incoming blade, it might land on Long Daozhi and cause serious injuries to him.

But, that was not what the crowd was focused on. What they were focused on was Chu Feng.

Lightning was flickering on Chu Feng’s forehead. The character ‘Divine’ was dazzling so brightly.

Most importantly, the aura being emitted by Chu Feng could be felt by everyone.

It... was that of a rank seven Utmost Exalted!!!

“You... exactly who are you?”

The Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster looked at Chu Feng. A look of fear was present in his eyes.

“Who am I? Am I not that Chu Feng you wanted to kill?” said Chu Feng.

“How could you, a mere brat, possess this cultivation?” The Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster voiced his misgivings.

“This cultivation?”

“What’s this? You’re scared?”

“Then, what about this?”

“Zzzzzz---”

Dazzling lightning emerged on Chu Feng’s body.

It was his Lightning Armor.

Once the Lightning Armor appeared, Chu Feng’s aura soared again. From rank seven Utmost Exalted, his cultivation increased to rank eight Utmost Exalted.

At this moment, it was not only the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect and Ancestral Martial Dragon City that were stunned. Even Long Daozhi was completely flabbergasted.

As for the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster, his face had turned pale in an instant.

It was from fear. He was completely terrified. Earlier, there was only a small amount of fear in his eyes. But now, fear had covered those eyes completely.

After all, a rank eight Utmost Exalted was an existence that he cannot contend against.

“What’s this? Scared?”

“Don’t be so scared just yet.”

Chu Feng smiled. Then, the sky above started changing. Violent winds swept past as roars sounded from above.

A fierce abnormal sign covered this region completely.

At the same time that was happening, the auras of four sacred beasts emerged from Chu Feng’s body.

The silhouettes of those four sacred beasts were all so very terrifyingly powerful. Like bodyguards, they spiraled around Chu Feng.

At this moment, Chu Feng’s cultivation increased again. From rank eight Utmost Exalted, his cultivation increased to rank nine Utmost Exalted!!!

“Heavens! I’m... I’m not dreaming, right?”

Kong Tianhui’s mouth was completely agape. He was rubbing his eyes nonstop. He even slapped his face ruthlessly.

It was not only him. Kong Ci and Xian Yun’s mouths were also slightly open. Their beautiful eyes were opened so wide that they’ve turned perfectly round.

As for Long Daozhi, Wuming Doutian, Wuming Xiongmo, Wuming Yuanzhi, Long Ning and the others from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, they too had stunned looks.

They all felt what they’re witnessing to be akin to a dream, a fantasy.

Chu Feng was able to increase his cultivation by three levels with his abilities even at Utmost Exalted realm?

That was simply something unheard of, something that they’ve never seen before.

Furthermore, this aura of his, it’s at rank nine Utmost Exalted!

That’s... peak Utmost Exalted, a fine line away from becoming Martial Exalted.

“It has clearly only been a short while since we last part.”

“Yet, Chu Feng actually grew this much?”

Compared to the pure shock that others were feeling, Wuming Doutian’s eyes were filled with complicated emotions.

Different from others, he used to be Chu Feng’s enemy.

“Chu Hanxian, Chu Xuanyuan, your descendant is even more terrifying than the two of you,” quietly muttered Wuming Doutian.

He couldn’t help but wipe his forehead. Cold sweat from lingering fear was covering his forehead.

Fortunately his opponent was the Chu Feng from the past and not the current Chu Feng. Furthermore, the conflict between his Wuming Clan and the Chu Clan had come to an end.

Else, he could imagine exactly what sort of end will befall his Wuming Clan.

“Putt---”

Suddenly, a muffled sound came from above.

It was the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster. He actually half kneeled in midair. He... was kneeling to Chu Feng.

“Milord, this old man was blind as a bat. I didn’t know you were this powerful. Please be magnanimous and spare my Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.”

This Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster was a quick-witted person. Seeing that he was no match for Chu Feng, he did not act stubbornly and immediately kneeled to Chu Feng and began apologizing to him.

“Big brother, why are you apologizing to him?! Stand up! How could we of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect bend our backs ourselves to others?!

“I refuse to believe that he would dare do anything to us when Lord Long Yinfeng is backing us!”

Suddenly, a furious roar sounded from afar. It was Dian Kuang.

Dian Kuang’s roar jolted away the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

That’s right! The reason why the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect was scary has never been their own strength. Instead, it has always been the backing they possessed -- the Dragon Clan’s Supreme Elder Long Yinfeng.

“Chu Feng, don’t kill them.”

Even Long Daozhi immediately walked forward and placed his hand on Chu Feng’s shoulder.

He knew of Chu Feng’s personality. Thus, he was afraid that Chu Feng would kill the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.

He knew how talented Chu Feng was. With his talent, he was certain that Chu Feng would be able to create a path for himself.

Because of that, Long Daozhi does not wish to see an existence akin to the Dragon Clan blocking Chu Feng’s path before he could reach his full growth potential.

“Lord City Master! Lord City Master!!!”

Right at this moment, several elders from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City rushed over.

They were panicking completely. It was like they were completely terrified by something.

When they saw that Long Daozhi and the experts from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were all here, they reacted like they saw hope. Before Long Daozhi and others could ask them what’s wrong, they spoke, “Lord City Master, it’s the Dragon Clan! The people from the Dragon Clan came!”

“There’s a whole lot of them!” reported those elders.

“What? Dragon Clan? Where?” Long Daozhi asked.

“They’re about to reach our city walls!” said those elders.

“What? They’re outside already?!”

Hearing those words, the expressions of Long Daozhi and the others from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City all changed enormously. They felt as if a calamity was about to befall them.

“Woosh---”

Right at this moment, a figure flew away with lightning speed.

It was the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster. It was not only him, his younger brother Dian Kuang also flew away with him.

Hearing the report from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s elders, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster knew that they’re saved.

Thus, he ignored everything else and grabbed his brother to flee this place. His intention was to seek help from the Dragon Clan.

“Crap!”

Seeing this, Long Daozhi immediately unleashed his full power to give chase.

He must stop them from reaching the Dragon Clan. He cannot allow them to meet.

If they do, with the personality of that Flying Feather Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he will most definitely add details to his story and male venomous slanders.

At that time, it would truly be a calamity that would befall them.

But, to his surprise, Long Daozhi discovered that he was unable to move.

It was actually Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s palm was placed on Long Daozhi’s shoulder. He was the one who prevented Long Daozhi from leaving.
