Chapter 2736 - Regarding Chu Feng

“Seniors, please don’t be so impatient. I have naturally called you all here because there is an important matter that requires your attention,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“What is it? Speak quickly,” The Military Hall’s Hall Master said impatiently.

“I believe that seniors have already heard of the fact that a demon-level genius has appeared in our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Who?” THe Treasure Hall’s Hall Master asked.

“You couldn’t possibly be talking about that brat who defeated our Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations at the Immortal Armament Villa’s hunting competition, right?” The Military Hall’s Hall Master asked.

“It is precisely that child,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“That child’s cultivation is too weak. We will have to wait until we see his future performance to determine whether or not he’s a demon-level genius.”

“Chu Xuanzhengfa, you couldn’t have possibly called us here because of that brat, right?” The World Spirit Hall’s Hall Master asked.

“That is precisely the reason,” Chu Xuanzhengfa answered.

“Impudent!”

Hearing those words, the World Spirit Hall’s Hall Master abruptly stood up. He actually shattered the side table as he stood up.

He was angry.

“Do you know how precious our time is?! Do you know how many things we have to take care of?!”

“You actually called all of us here because of a brat like that!? Chu Xuanzhengfa, exactly what are you thinking?! Are you so bored that you have nothing better to do?!” The World Spirit Hall’s Hall Master asked furiously.

At the same time, the Military Hall’s Hall Master and the Treasure Hall’s Hall Master also looked to Chu Xuanzhengfa with ill-intended gazes.

Their expressions seemed to be telling Chu Xuanzhengfa that he must provide with them a proper explanation.

Otherwise, they would teach him a lesson for wasting their time.

“If he were an ordinary person of the younger generation, I would naturally not have called seniors here. However, that child possesses an unknown background. Furthermore, he has trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Most importantly, that child’s name is Chu Feng,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“So what?” The World Spirit Hall’s Hall Master asked.

“Seniors, don’t tell me that none of you have suspected this Chu Feng’s identity,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“We have. However, even if he is Chu Xuanyuan’s son, so what? And what if he is not Chu Xuanyuan’s son?”

“Could it be that you’re afraid that if he really is Chu Xuanyuan’s son that he will come and take vengeance upon our Chu Heavenly Clan?”

“Humph. Even with how arrogant that Chu Xuanyuan was back then, wasn’t he still completely taken care of by Lord Clan Chief, and made to absolutely submit?”

“Even Chu Xuanyuan was unable to do anything, what could his son possibly do even if he is still alive?” The Military Hall’s Hall Master said.

“What I wish to discuss with seniors is not whether or not that Chu Feng will try to take revenge upon our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“What I wish to discuss with seniors if whether or not to take Chu Feng back into our Chu Heavenly Clan and nurture him with emphasis should he be Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“What did you say? Take him back into our Chu Heavenly Clan? Nurture him with emphasis? Have you gone mad?”

“That Chu Feng is the same as Chu Xuanyuan. He is someone that has been expelled from our Chu Heavenly Clan. There is absolutely no trace of relationship between him and our Chu Heavenly Clan,” The Military Hall’s Hall Master spoke emotionally.

“Chu Xuanzhengfa, the way I see it, you have been in closed-door training so much that you’ve trained yourself silly,” The World Spirit Hall’s Hall Master mocked.

“Humph,” The Treasure Hall’s Hall Master snorted. He was looking at Chu Xuanzhengfa with an expression of someone looking at a fool.

The reason for that was because he felt that anyone with the slightest bit of brains would not have said this sort of thing.

“What happened back then was done by Chu Xuanyuan. At that time, Chu Feng was merely an infant.”

“There are some things that he should not have to assume responsibility for. Furthermore, no matter what, what’s flowing through his veins is the blood of our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“If he is truly still alive, I feel that our Chu Heavenly Clan should nurture him with emphasis to atone for our crimes,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“What the hell are you talking about?! Atone for our crimes?! Since when have we committed any crimes?!” At that moment, the Treasure Hall’s Hall Master was unable to contain himself. He pointed to Chu Xuanyuan and questioned him with a thunderous voice.

When he spoke, the entire palace hall trembled violently. In fact, streams of oppressive might were sweeping forth, bombarding Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“If that child really is Chu Feng, it would mean the the talent test that we conducted on him was incorrect.”

“If it wasn’t for Chu Xuanyuan suspecting that the test was wrong and insisting on testing Chu Feng’s talent again, he would not have entered a verbal altercation with others, and the thing that happened back then wouldn’t have happened.”

“Are you to say that this is not because of our negligence, that we are not wrong?”

“Since we have wronged them, then of course we have committed an offense. As such, shouldn’t we atone for our crimes?”

Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke those words with a very powerful and resounding tone. His each and every word sounded like lightning. His voice actually managed to overshadow that Treasure Hall’s Hall Master.

“Chu Xuanzhengfa, you are truly undisciplined and out of control! You actually dared to put forth a criminal charge upon our own clan! Could it be that you are an accomplice of that Chu Xuanyuan?! Or could it be that you want to betray our clan?!” The Military Hall’s Hall Master asked with fuming rage between gritted teeth.

“Senior, I would instead like to ask you this. Could it be that you do not know what it means to shoulder what one has done?”

“Are you perhaps undaring to admit what we have done?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Impudent! You rude youngster! Today, I will teach you a lesson on behalf of your father! Otherwise, you will truly dare to go against even the heavens itself!”

As the Military Hall’s Hall master spoke, a boundless aura openly surged forth.

At the same time, his ferocious aura began to move toward Chu Xuanzhengfa to oppressive him with a might capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas.

However, Chu Xuanzhengfa merely waved his sleeve, and that incoming oppressive might was dispersed. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Following that, Chu Xuanzhengfa narrowed his brows, and a chilliness suddenly emerged in his eyes.

“Boom~~~”

A loud explosion. Oppressive might akin to a flood erupted from within his body.

Although his oppressive might was invisible, it instantly filled the entire palace hall.

At that moment, not to mention the others present, even the Military Hall, the Treasure Hall and the World Spirit Hall’s Hall Masters all revealed an enormous change in expression.

Both shock and fear emerged on their faces.

The reason for that was because they were unable to move in the slightest. They were completely bound by Chu Xuanzhengfa’s oppressive might.

Chu Xuanzhengfa’s cultivation was actually above their own!!!

“Three seniors, if you all wanted to bully the young, then you have picked the wrong target. I, Chu Xuanzhengfa, am most definitely not someone that you all can bully and humiliate as you wish,” Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke those words one word at a time.

With each word he spoke, the expressions of those three Hall Masters grew even more distorted. The expression of pain grew more and more obvious on their faces.

“Chu Xuanzhengfa, what are you planning to do? Could it be that you plan to act disrespectfully toward your seniors?” The three Hall Masters spoke in unison.

“It is you all who attacked me first. Are you to say that I cannot fight back?”

Once Chu Xuanzhengfa said those words, those three Hall Masters started to grimace in pain. They were on the verge of being unable to withstand the oppressive sensation.

“Zhengfa, we can talk things out. There is no need for this,” The Treasure Hall’s Hall Master said.

“That’s right. Zhengfa, it is not that we do not want to discuss this with you, it is merely that this matter is no small matter, and not something that we can decide ourselves. Even if we are to discuss this, we should wait till Lord Clan Chief leaves his closed-door training so that he can make the decision,” The World Spirit Hall’s Hall Master said.

“Zhengfa, you must not be this impulsive. If you are to injure us because of that Chu Feng, you will have to shoulder the responsibility for your actions too. Furthermore, we do not even know if that Chu Feng really is Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

“Even if there is friendship between you and Chu Xuanyuan, even if you want to help him, you cannot act this impatiently. Else, if someone were to catch wind of this, you will end up being the one to suffer. We are all thinking for your good,” The Military Hall’s Hall Master said.

Seeing that the three Hall Masters have given in, Chu Xuanzhengfa smiled faintly. Then, he retrieved his oppressive might.
