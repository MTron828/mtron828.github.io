Chapter 2623 - Fleeing In Defeat

“Chu Feng, don’t kill me! I beg of you, please don’t kill me, please don’t kill me!!!”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster actually began to beg Chu Feng for forgiveness.

“You don’t want to die?”

“Very well, get down on your knees, kowtow and beg me,” Chu Feng said to the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

He made the same demand as the one the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster made to Zi Xunyi earlier.

As Chu Feng made that demand, the crimson gaseous flames that had surrounded the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster released him.

The intention of this action was very obvious. Chu Feng wanted the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster to kneel before him and beg for forgiveness.

“Chu Feng, please spare me, please spare me. As long as you spare my life, I will agree to do whatever you want me to do.”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster kneeled in midair without the slightest hesitation. He began to kowtow and beg Chu Feng for forgiveness repeatedly.

His actions could be said to be very natural and unforced. There was not the slightest bit of hesitation at all.

However, Chu Feng had already anticipated such a thing.

Chu Feng had long since known that the great majority of the evildoers were people that would bully the weak but fear the strong. Before the weak, they would act like unyielding tough guys. However, when before the strong, their true, cowardly natures would be fully revealed.

Of course, there were most definitely unyielding and strong-willed evildoers. Merely, their numbers were relatively small.

That said, this was also understandable. After all, being craven and cowardly was human nature.

Not to mention the evildoers, even the great majority of benevolent individuals were afraid of death.

In other words, what was rare were those that were not afraid of death.

“Chu Feng, please spare me. I am willing to do whatever you want me to do.”

Seeing that Chu Feng did not have any response, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster grew even more earnest in his begging. Even though he was clearly in the sky, resounding slamming noises could be heard every time he kowtowed to Chu Feng. His forehead even became bloody.

From this, it could be seen how earnestly he was in his begging for forgiveness.

“Did you ever think that you would see such a day when you killed those infants?” Chu Feng asked the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

“You... what do you mean by that?” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster pulled his pupils back. He noticed that the situation was amiss.

“I am going to have you pay the price,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, several stretches of crimson gaseous flames flew over. They tightly surrounded the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

“I have already begged you for forgiveness, why are you still planning to kill me?!”

“Ahhh~~~~, bastard, let me go!!!”

“Chu Feng, you are going back on your promise!!!”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster screamed as he questioned Chu Feng’s action.

“You’re mistaken. I, Chu Feng, have always been one to keep my promises. Earlier, I said that I would have you die a miserable death.”

“Thus, I will definitely make you suffer a miserable death.”

“Nothing that I said after that was valid at all,” Chu Feng said mockingly.

“You!!!”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster started to gnash his teeth furiously. However, he was powerless to do anything.

The reason for that was because he discovered that the disparity between his power and the Evil God Sword was simply too enormous. They were simply not on the same level at all.

He was filled with regret. By the time he discovered this, it was already too late.

“Save me! Save me!!!”

Suddenly, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster started to shout.

Hearing those shouts, Chu Feng’s expression changed. He discovered that the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s cry for help was not aimed at him. Instead, it was meant for someone else.

There was someone behind the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster?

“Who are you talking to?” Chu Feng asked coldly.

However, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster did not answer Chu Feng. Instead, he continued to cry ‘save me.’

“If you do not tell me, I will make you suffer so much that you’ll wish you’re dead,” Chu Feng spoke coldly.

After Chu Feng said those words, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster began to sustain even greater sufferings.

The crimson gaseous flames that surrounded the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster started to flicker with a dark black radiance. Even its aura became increasingly strange.

The torture that the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was bearing at that moment was most definitely not as simple as just being burned.

“Speak!!!” Chu Feng shouted.

However, to Chu Feng’s surprise, even though the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was in so much pain that he wished he was dead, he still refused to answer Chu Feng’s question.

“Boy, you will not be able to obtain the answer from him. Let this Evil God help you.”

Right at that moment, a voice sounded by Chu Feng’s ear. It was the Evil God Sword’s voice.

When the Evil God Sword’s voice was heard, Chu Feng felt that his body as well as his consciousness were being attacked.

It was an extremely intense attack from the Evil God Sword. The Evil God Sword was trying to invade his body and forcibly seize it.

“Damn it, at such a time!”

At that moment, Chu Feng looked to the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster with a gaze filled with irrreconciliation.

He wanted to kill the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. However, at that moment... he was unable to do so.

The reason for that was because he could not continue to utilize the power of the Evil God Sword. If he were to continue to utilize the power of the Evil God Sword, he would have his body seized by the Evil God Sword once again.

Chu Feng had no idea whether he would be as fortunate as he was last time if his body was seized again.

Thinking about that, Chu Feng wanted to put his Evil God Sword away. However, he was shocked to discover that the Evil God Sword seemed to be stuck to his hand. Even though he wanted to put it away, he was unable to do so.

It was not only the hand that he held the Evil God Sword with. At that moment, Chu Feng felt as if his entire body was no longer under his control.

“Boy, even your body has grown fond of this Evil God’s powers.”

“Even your body is unwilling to break away from this Evil God. You want to break away from this Evil God, are you really capable of doing that?” The Evil God Sword’s mocking voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ears.

“My apologies, I am the one to decide upon my own body,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he gathered up his spirit and cast it upon the hand that he was holding the Evil God Sword with. Chu Feng needed to immediately release the Evil God Sword. Else... he would be in danger.

When Chu Feng began to battle against the Evil God Sword, the crimson clouds that filled the sky started to gradually dissipate.

Naturally, as the crimson clouds in the sky started to dissipate, the crimson gaseous flames that surrounded the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster also started to dissipate.

Although the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster had regained his liberty after the crimson gaseous flames dissipated, not only were his clothes all burned away, but he was completely changed beyond recognition.

He was still screaming in pain. It was only after a while that he realized that he had managed to escape from the crimson flames.

Upon discovering that he had broken free, the first thing the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster did was turn his gaze toward Chu Feng.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was unable to hear the conversation between Chu Feng and the Evil God Sword. He was only able to see that Chu Feng was tightly holding onto the Evil God Sword. As for the hand that he was holding the Evil God Sword with, it was trembling violently.

“Is he receiving the backlash?”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster felt that to be what had happened. The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s eyes were tightly closed. He was not looking at him. The crimson gaseous flames that surrounded Chu Feng was also extremely unstable.

This Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was, after all, an old monster that had lived for thousands of years. He was able to tell with a single glance that Chu Feng was resisting the power of the Evil God Sword.

“Truly, the Heavens are helping me!”

Seeing that an opportunity had arrived, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster resisted the pain with great difficulty and tightly held the Dragonscale Dagger in his hand. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He planned to seize this opportunity to kill Chu Feng.

However, right after that thought came to his mind, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster suddenly ceased all movement.

Intense fear appeared in his eyes as he looked at Chu Feng.

That’s right. He was afraid. He did not dare to attack Chu Feng again.

He feared that he would not be a match for Chu Feng. If Chu Feng were to attack him again, he would most definitely die.

“Woosh~~~”

After a series of mental struggles, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster did not attack Chu Feng. Instead, he turned around and started flying toward the direction of Chen Heavenly City.

He had actually fled.
