Chapter 5145: The Disciple of the First Guest Elder

“Young master Chu Feng, he seems to be a junior?”

Song Yuwei also sensed that the white-robed young man, but she found it hard to accept the situation too, which was why she was seeking confirmation from Chu Feng.

“He’s a junior,” Chu Feng replied affirmatively.

“A junior has actually reached rank two Half-God level?” Song Yuwei exclaimed.

She couldn’t believe that the white-robed young man was actually stronger than her in terms of cultivation.

Boom!

The white-robed young man raised his hand once more and thrust his palm toward the disguise formation, but it failed to destroy the formation. This showed just how resilient the disguise formation was.

It would be hard to destroy it with sheer martial power.

“He’s doing this on purpose,” Chu Feng said.

He realized that the white-robed young man wasn’t really planning on breaking the disguise formation with his martial power. Despite his failed attempt, his expression remained calm as if he was waiting for something.

But what could he be waiting for?

Weng!

There was suddenly a burst of light. A spirit formation gate manifested where the disguise formation’s opening was.

Many silhouettes darted out from the spirit formation gate. Within moments, there were already more than ten thousand individuals surrounding the white-robed young man. They were all from the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

Soon, another 24 elders stepped out from the spirit formation gate and stood against the white-robed young man. They commanded much greater strength compared to the others, and most notably, they were dressed in world spiritist robes that glowed with divine light.

Twenty of them were inscribed with a lifelike white dragon that coiled around them, and they emanated auras comparable to a rank one Half-God level cultivator.

That was the White Dragon Mark.

“God-cloak World Spiritist?”

There was a clear ranking system amongst God-cloak World Spiritists. From weakest to strongest, they were divided into the White Dragon Mark, Gray Dragon Mark, Blue Dragon Mark, Violet Dragon Mark, Golden Dragon Mark, Imperial Dragon Mark, Immortal Dragon Mark, Exalted Dragon Mark, and Saint Dragon Mark.

Clearly, these twenty world spiritists were at White Dragon God-cloak.

As for the other four, three of them had a lifelike gray dragon inscribed on their robes, and their auras were significantly stronger than that of the White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists. Clearly, they had reached rank two God-cloak level, Gray Dragon God-cloak.

However, the Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists weren’t the strongest of the group. It was a Blue Dragon God-cloak.

He was a short and emaciated old man who had a fierce look on his face.

“Young master Chu Feng, that man is Situ Tingye,” Song Yuwei said.

Chu Feng was astonished to see so many experts gathered in a single place. Be it Half-God level cultivators or God-cloak World Spiritists, those were powerful existences to him. Yet, so many of them were actually gathered in a single place.

Those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan had shown themselves presumably because of the white-robed young man.

Despite being encircled, the white-robed young man showed no fear on his face. It turned out that he was waiting for the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen to appear. He was intentionally luring them out.

Rage and murderous intent could initially be seen on the faces of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but they were alarmed to discover that the white-robed young man was a rank two Half-God level junior. That prompted them to immediately rein in their killing intent.

It was clear that the white-robed young man was someone whom they had to tread carefully around.

“Who are you?” Situ Tingye asked.

“Bai Yunqing,” the white-robed young man replied.

“Bai Yunqing?”

Situ Tingye began racking his brain to see if he knew anyone who went by the name of Bai Yunqing, it didn’t seem to ring a bell to him.

“It’s not surprising that you haven’t heard of me, but you should have heard of my master,” Bai Yunqing said.

“May I know the name of your esteemed master?” Situ Tingye asked.

“My master is the First Guest Elder of the Totem Dragon Clan,” Bai Yunqing replied.

“First Guest Elder?”

Those words shocked everyone from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. Disbelief and horror filled their faces.

“Y-you’re the disciple of Lord Taishi?” Situ Tingye asked.

“Take a look for yourself.”

Bai Yunqing tossed a token over.

Situ Tingye quickly caught the token. The moment he came into contact with it, the token produced a tremendous pulse of energy that induced a phenomenon.

Boom!

Dark clouds and lightning bolts quickly filled the sky. Vaguely, one could see a dragon’s silhouette. At the same time, the token glowed brightly with the words ‘Totem Dragon Clan’.

Situ Tingye’s cheeks twitched.

What left him even more terrified were the words ‘First Guest Elder’ written beside.

Clearly, this was a token belonging to the First Guest Elder of the Totem Dragon Clan. It would be hard for anyone else to imitate the phenomenon and the unique energy harnessed within the token.

Bai Yunqing was likely to be the bona fide disciple of the First Guest Elder.

Situ Tingye quickly descended to the ground and respectfully returned the token to Bai Yunqing’s hand.

“I would have never expected Lord Taishi’s disciple to drop by our humble True Dragon Starfield. Please pardon us for our lack of hospitality,” Situ Tingye said with a deep bow.

The others from the Situ World Spiritist Clan also quickly bowed deeply too.

“Why are the lot of you hiding here?” Bai Yunqing asked as he took back his token.

“We…”

Hesitation flickered across Situ Tingye’s face.

“Are you still trying to withhold the truth from me?” Bai Yunqing sneered.

“Milord, I dare not to deceive you. We have discovered an ancient remnant here, and we suspect that it contains the Lord Zhenlong’s legacy.”

Situ Tingye realized that Bai Qingye had likely caught wind of the news and came prepared, so he dared not to utter any falsehood.

“Do you know who Lord Zhenlong has sworn fealty to?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Just like Milord, Lord Zhenlong has sworn fealty to the Totem Dragon Clan,” Situ Tingye replied.

“Since Lord Zhenlong serves the Totem Dragon Clan, don’t you think that his legacy should belong to the Totem Dragon Clan too? You neglected to report the discovery of the ancient remnant… are you intending to take it for your own? Situ World Spiritist Clan, how audacious of you!”

A cold glint flashed across Bai Yunqing’s eyes.

His words made everyone from the Situ World Spiritist Clan turn pale.
