Chapter 3685 - The Powerful Gu Mingyuan

“That’s not necessarily so!”

A voice sounded explosively. That voice caught everyone’s attention.

Then, two figures appeared out of nowhere and stood before Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu.

They were two women.

One of them was a young woman. She had an extremely beautiful look to her.

As for the other, she was an older woman. She too possessed beauty capable of causing the downfall of a city or state. Most importantly, that woman’s appearance greatly resembled that of the young woman.

From a glance, the two of them looked like sisters.

However, the young woman was giving off an air of youthfulness, whereas the older woman was not only exceedingly refined, but she was also emitting an extremely tyrannical air.

Standing there, she seemed like an empress, an insufferably arrogant empress. It was as if she did not place anything in the world in her eyes.

Upon seeing those two people, everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, especially the younger generations, were all astonished.

They were able to recognize with a single glance that the young woman was someone from their Chu Heavenly Clan. She was the daughter of their Chu Heavenly Clan’s current Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall master, Chu Lingxi.

Different from those of the younger generation that were shocked by Chu Lingxi’s appearance, those from the older generation were astonished by the appearance of that woman who emitted that tyrannical aura.

They all knew that woman.

That woman was the princess of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, Gu Mingyuan.

“Gu Mingyuan?”

Even the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master was greatly alarmed by Gu Mingyuan’s appearance. One could even hear fear in his voice.

“Gu Mingyuan, that is the renowned Gu Mingyuan?”

After the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master spoke, the people present that did not know Gu Mingyuan came to learn who that woman was. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Back then, there were two exceptional geniuses in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Because those two geniuses were so overwhelmingly powerful that they caused all others to lose their splendor, there was a saying in the Ancestral Martial Starfield - the male top genius is Chu Xuanyuan, and the female top genius is Gu Mingyuan.

Those two represented the top existences of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. They possessed talent capable of showing disdain for all other geniuses.

Although Chu Xuanyuan was dead, Gu Mingyuan was still alive.

One could tell how terrifying Gu Mingyuan’s fame was just by the fear that was present in the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s words.

“Princess of the Ancient Clan, are you standing up for the Chu Heavenly Clan?” the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master asked. His voice was no longer as powerful as before. Instead, it was rather lacking in confidence.

“What if I am and what if I’m not?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

Her tone was extremely cold and arrogant. Even though the aura she emitted was clearly that of a rank one Exalted, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master was akin to an ant before her, as she did not even place him in her eyes at all.

However, it just so happened that even though Gu Mingyuan was showing such contempt toward him, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master did not dare to put up any resistance.

“Since the Princess of the Ancient Clan wants to protect the Chu Heavenly Clan, this one will be taking his leave.”

After saying those words, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master waved his sleeve and prepared to leave with the Blood-devouring Hall’s eight experts.

That scene shocked the people present.

To cower before a fight...

Furthermore, the person cowering at that moment was the infamous Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

Although they were both rank one Utmost Exalted, what was the attitude the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master had when facing Grandmaster Liangqiu, and what was his attitude when facing Gu Mingyuan?

This was simply too enormous of a disparity. Because of this, everyone present was able to realize how powerful Gu Mingyuan was.

“You want to come and go as you please?”

However, right at that moment, an enormous martial power barrier covered heaven and earth, sealing off the Blood-devouring Hall’s escape.

It was Gu Mingyuan. With a single thought, she controlled her martial power and created a barrier.

She was not prepared to let things go.

“Gu Mingyuan, I am giving you face today and I’m willing to drop this matter. Don’t you refuse to accept the face that is being given to you.”

At that moment, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master turned around. Finally, there was no longer fear in his eyes. Instead, it was replaced with anger.

Indeed, Gu Mingyuan’s action was rather overbearing.

After all, they were both rank one Utmost Exalted. There was no difference in their cultivations. Furthermore, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master was someone that had been undefeated his entire life.

“Heh...”

However, facing the clearly furious Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master, the corners of Gu Mingyuan’s mouth rose into a smile.

Her smile was very beautiful. However, it was also a smile filled with disdain.

“Those who speak to me in such a manner all end up suffering serious consequences.”

“Woosh~~~”

As those words were spoken, Gu Mingyuan disappeared.

“Bang~~~”

In the next moment, an explosion was heard.

Martial power appeared at the location where the Blood-devouring Hall’s experts were and began to spread in a spherical manner. That martial power was very strong. If that martial power were to spread, likely, apart from Grandmaster Liangqiu, all the people present would end up dying.

However, that martial power did not spread. After it reached a certain size, it stopped expanding.

It was a barrier. From the aura, one could tell that it was the barrier that Gu Mingyuan had set up earlier.

When that barrier appeared, the surroundings turned exceptionally quiet. The crowd were unable to hear anything. They also had no idea what was happening inside.

Chu Feng attempted to see through the barrier with his Heaven’s Eyes.

However, not even his Heaven’s Eyes were able to see through that martial power barrier.

The reason for that was because that was no ordinary martial power at all. Instead, it was a special secret skill used to seal things off.

That secret skill had a similar effect to world spirit techniques. However, the power of that secret skill was not to be looked down upon. This was especially the case when it was used by an Utmost Exalted-level expert. Not even a world spiritist of Chu Feng’s caliber could see through it.

“Crack~~~”

“Crack~~~”

“Crack~~~”

Soon, the martial power barrier started to crack.

“Boom~~~”

Following that, the martial power barrier shattered.

“Woosh~~~”

After shattering, a ray of light flew out from the martial power barrier and landed in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.

The enormous impact left a humongous crater in the ground.

Although thick smoke was all over the crater, the crowd were able to see nine figures inside it.

It was not only the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall. Even the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master was present.

At that moment, those nine top experts were completely covered in cuts and bruises. Furthermore, a chain had bound the nine of them together.

“Your Chu Heavenly Clan can take care of these nine trash.”

A voice sounded from the sky.

Looking toward the voice, one could see Gu Mingyuan standing in midair.

She appeared exactly the same. Not only was she still emitting that terrifying aura, but she still looked insufferably arrogant.

However, at that moment, no one present was able to remain calm and collected.

Enormous waves were raised in their hearts.

Not even Chu Feng was an exception.
