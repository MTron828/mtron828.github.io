Chapter 2273 - The Appointed Date

“The relationship between Tuoba Shangshui and Li Rui is indeed extraordinary. Li Rui was actually Tuoba Shangshui’s biological grandson. He was also the sole heir to the Tuoba Family.”

“Merely, very few people knew about this matter. Even Li Rui himself did not know that his master was actually his biological grandfather,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“Even I did not know about this matter. How did you know about it?” Su Jingrui asked in astonishment.

“I believe you were also able to tell that they possessed an extraordinary relationship. Because of that, I had my men secretly investigate the matter.”

“Tuoba Shangshui also possessed his own reasoning as for why he did not want to make this matter public. Thus, I did not reveal the matter either,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“But, even if Li Rui was the only heir to the Tuoba family, there shouldn’t be a reason for Tuoba Shangshui to react like this for him, no? His actions before he died did not resemble his style,” Su Jingrui was still doubtful.

“If Tuoba Shangshui still possessed the ability to create more heirs, he would naturally not react in such a manner over Li Rui’s death,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“There was actually such a thing?” Su Jingrui revealed an astonished expression. He seemed to have thought of something.

“Yes, if that wasn’t the case, he would definitely not have acted in such a manner,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“With his character, I guess this could be considered karma,” Su Jingrui sneered.

At that moment, Chu Feng realized what had happened.

Tuoba Shangshui might have suffered some sort of encounter that caused him to lose the ability to reproduce. As Li Rui was the sole heir to the Tuoba family, it would mean that he was Tuoba Shangshui’s sole seed. That was the reason why Tuoba Shangshui had cared so much for Li Rui.

“Little friend Chu Feng, since you plan to leave, I will not insist on making you stay. These are my regards, please accept them,” As the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master spoke, he took out a Cosmos Sack and handed it to Chu Feng.

“Lord Valley Master, I have already received your gifts before. As such, I absolutely cannot accept these too,” Chu Feng hurriedly refused.

The reason for that was because the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master had indeed presented Chu Feng with a lot of gifts already. Those gifts were very valuable items. Not only were there a lot of world spiritist treasures, there were also many Incomplete Ancestral Armaments.

As for the items in the Cosmos Sack that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master was presenting today, they were even more precious than the items he had given Chu Feng previously.

“Little friend Chu Feng, if you do not accept them, our Lord Valley Master will not let you out of our Sunset Cloud Valley.”

“Thus, it is better that you accept them,” Su Jingrui said.

“Little friend Chu Feng, Elder Su is not joking around,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said with a smile. Although he said it with a joking tone, it seemed that he truly planned to do this.

That was, if Chu Feng refused to accept his gifts, he would refuse to let Chu Feng leave.

In the end, he was still feeling guilty toward Chu Feng, and wanted to use this method to decrease the guilt that he felt.

“Since that’s the case, Chu Feng will accept them then. Lord Valley Master, thank you,” Chu Feng also knew that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master was feeling ashamed. Thus, in the end, he accepted the Cosmos Sack.

“Little friend Chu Feng, let me see you off,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master wished to personally escort Chu Feng.

“Lord Valley Master, before leaving, I wish to go and bid my farewells to Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s no issue at all. I’ll order my men to summon them here,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“Lord Valley Master, there’s no need for that. I can go and see them personally,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s good too. I’ll show you the way,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“Lord Valley Master, the Three Stars Hall is still waiting. I think it would be unwell to ignore them the entire time, no?” Right at that moment, Su Jingrui said.

“Eh...” Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master immediately revealed a difficult expression.

“Lord Valley Master, if you have things that you must take care of, please go ahead and take care of them. This Chu Feng can go find Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang personally,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master nodded. Although he did not personally lead the way for Chu Feng, he ordered others to guide Chu Feng.

After Chu Feng left, Su Jingrui asked the Valley Master, “Today is the appointed date with the Three Stars Hall. With Chu Feng here, he might be able to help us. Why did you not mention this matter to him?”

The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master took a long sigh. Then, he said, “Our Sunset Cloud Valley have already wronged and troubled little friend Chu Feng enormously. For the sake of helping us, he nearly ended up losing his life. I find it truly difficult to inconvenience him again.”

“After all, he is not someone of our Sunset Cloud Valley. Even in coming to our Sunset Cloud Valley, he was forced here after being held prisoner by Tuoba Shangshui.”

“In that case, we can only admit defeat then. After all, the Three Stars Hall invited Daoist Gold Star over to help them. Even though Daoist Gold Star is also only an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it remains that he is an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. There is no one in our Sunset Cloud Valley capable of competing against him,” Su Jingrui said.

[1. Bee used a different Daoist when referring to Daoist Three Swords and this Daoist Gold Star. In Daoist Gold Star, he literally wrote Daoist (Dao Ren/ Dao Person), whereas for Daoist Three Swords, he wrote Daoist (Zhen Ren/True Person). Zhen Ren/True Person is kinda like an enlightened daoist. Still daoist though...]

The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master sighed again. Then, he said, “Thus, let me go alone. Senior brother, you do not have to accompany me to receive this humiliation.”

“How could I do that? I also took part in this gamble back then. Even if we must admit defeat, I must still accompany you.”

“Today, us martial brothers shall allow ourselves to be ridiculed by that old fellow from the Three Stars Hall together,” Su Jingrui said with a smile.

Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master was at first startled. Then, he looked to Su Jingrui and saw that he had a determined expression on his face. Thus, he smiled lightly and said, “Sure enough, it is only senior brother who is willing to endure trials and tribulations together with me.”

“Of course,” Su Jingrui smiled.

Then, the two men’s bodies shifted. They began to fly toward the northwestern region of the Sunset Cloud Valley.

Located in that direction was the place where the Sunset Cloud Valley would receive their honored guests.

......

Chu Feng first arrived at Elder Ning Shuang’s location to bid farewell to Elder Ning Shuang. Then, he arrived at Xu Yiyi’s residence.

“Chu Feng? Why would you be here? How are you? Are you feeling better now?”

“Did you know that you have been unconscious for many days now? I wanted to go see you the entire time. However, your world spirit refused entry to everyone,” When Xu Yiyi saw Chu Feng, she immediately revealed an overjoyed expression. Joyfully, she ran toward Chu Feng.

“Yiyi, rest assured, I have recovered completely,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“You’ve truly recovered completely?” Xu Yiyi was a bit skeptical, and began to personally inspect Chu Feng. Upon discovering that Chu Feng was truly fine, Xu Yiyi revealed a joyous expression and patted Chu Feng’s shoulder, “Not bad, you’ve actually recovered this quickly. That day, you truly scared me.”

“Rest assured, I am truly fine now,” Chu Feng said with a smile. He was able to tell that Xu Yiyi had been worried for him from the bottom of her heart.

Afterwards, Chu Feng started to chat with Xu Yiyi. After a while, Chu Feng told her about his intention in coming.

“Chu Feng, you’re leaving? But you’ve just recovered from your injuries, shouldn’t you...?” Xu Yiyi revealed an expression of reluctance to part.

“I have already mentioned this to Lord Valley Master. I have also met your master. They have already consented to it. Furthermore, Lord Valley Master even sent me an enormous gift,” Chu Feng said.

“In that case, it seems that I will not be able to make you stay either,” Xu Yiyi said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Chu Feng did not answer her. Instead, he smiled and shook his head.

“Chu Feng, do you really not plan to become our Sunset Cloud Valley’s guest elder?” Xu Yiyi asked.

“Yiyi, I possess my own reasons. I hope that you can understand,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well then,” Xu Yiyi said no more. Merely, her gaze grew even lonelier.

Suddenly, Chu Feng said, “Someone’s here.”

“Little sister Yiyi, I’ve come to see you,” Sure enough, not long after Chu Feng said those words, a woman ran in.

This woman was rather good-looking. Her age was about the same as Xu Yiyi’s. She wore a long green skirt and appeared very spirited.

As for her cultivation, it was not weak either. She was a rank one Half Martial Ancestor.

However, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that this woman was not a disciple of the Sunset Cloud Valley.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng was able to clearly see the words ‘Three Stars Hall’ on the title plate hanging on her waist.

“Little sister Biyu, why would you be here?” Upon seeing this woman, Xu Yiyi had a joyous expression. [2. Maybe because they’re of the same age, they both address one another as little sister?]

“Have you forgotten? Today is the appointed date between our Headmaster, your Valley Master and your master,” The woman said with a smile.
