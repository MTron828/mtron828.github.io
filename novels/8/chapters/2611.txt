Chapter 2611 - The Appearance Of The Infant Soul Sect

After that defensive formation was opened, the originally tranquil city was no longer still. Many densely packed figures began to fly out from the city. They covered the sky and appeared before the crowd.

These people were all wearing black gowns. There were so many of them that they numbered in the several hundred thousands.

Seeing this, the allied army became serious. The reason for that was because they were wearing the same outfit as that of the Infant Soul Sect.

Furthermore, with how many people there were, the allied army did not dare to underestimate them.

However, they soon discovered that while those people were all wearing the Infant Soul Sect’s outfit, their overall level of cultivation was not very high. When compared with the allied army composed of elites, it was a heaven and earth difference. They were simply not at the same level at all.

If the allied army were eagles flying in the sky, then these people that had appeared above Chen Heavenly City were merely insignificant houseflies.

Upon closer inspection, the crowd discovered that those people were all from the Chen Heavenly Clan.

The Chen Heavenly Clan’s army was standing in an orderly fashion in the sky. They were standing in confrontation against the allied army.

Even though the difference in strength between them was enormous, they were still extremely confident and without the slightest amount of fear when facing the allied army.

Soon, a figure walked out from among the Chen Heavenly Clan’s army. That person arrived at the front of the army. This person was a peak Martial Ancestor-level old man. As for this person... he was the Chen Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I am the Chen Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. On behalf of the Infant Soul Sect, I welcome all the honored guests that have arrived here today,” The Chen Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke with a beaming smile.

“So, you’ve really joined the Infant Soul Sect?” Ying Mingchao asked.

“I never mentioned that any of this was a lie,” The Chen Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Then let me ask you this, have the people of your Chen Heavenly Clan, these people wearing the outfit of the Infant Soul Sect, used innocent infants to cultivate a demonic technique?” Ying Mingchao asked.

“We have indeed trained in it. However, I must make one correction. That is not a demonic technique.”

The Chen Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke without hesitation. He firmly admitted to having used infants as cultivation resources. Furthermore, he spoke in such a frank and open manner. It was as if what they’d done was not shameful at all.

“You all are truly animals lower than pigs and dogs!!!!”

“How could people as cruel and merciless as you all exist?!”

After hearing the Chen Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief admitting to it, the allied army, as well as the people that had retreated, all grew extremely furious, and began to gnash their teeth.

“Very well. Since you all have admitted to it, do not blame me, Ying Mingchao, for being ruthless.”

As Ying Mingchao spoke, his gown started to move, and his hair started to flutter. Boundless oppressive might started to emit from his body. Like an invisible tide, his oppressive might covered Chen Heavenly City. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At the moment when Ying Mingchao unleashed his oppressive might, the expressions of everyone outside Chen Heavenly City changed. They were all able to sense how overwhelming the power of Ying Mingchao’s oppressive might was.

Before Ying Mingchao’s overwhelmingly powerful oppressive might, not to mention these people from the Chen Heavenly Clan, but even all of Chen Heavenly City could be instantly destroyed.

Thus, when they felt Ying Mingchao’s oppressive might, a thought came to everyone’s minds.

‘Ying Mingchao’s reputation of the number one expert in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is fully justified.’

When even the Kong Heavenly Clan was extinguished by Ying Mingchao alone, they believed that the Infant Soul Sect would not be able to escape calamity today.

However, right at the moment when everyone felt that the Chen Heavenly Clan would be instantly exterminated, a boundless wave of oppressive might suddenly swept forth from within the Chen Heavenly City and collided with Ying Mingchao’s oppressive might outside Chen Heavenly City.

“Boom~~~”

The collision between the two oppressive mights created an ear-piercing explosion. The collision also created energy ripples that started to move toward the allied army.

“Woosh~~~”

Fortunately, Ying Mingchao was standing at the front of the allied army. With a wave of his sleeve, he managed to disperse the ferocious energy ripples.

When the crowd looked to Chen Heavenly City again, they were shocked to discover that Chen Heavenly City was completely unscathed. As for the people from the Chen Heavenly Clan, they were also completely uninjured.

That oppressive might from Chen Heavenly City was actually able to match Ying Mingchao’s oppressive might.

This meant that there was a person in there that was at least a rank two True Immortal.

“This...”

The allied army were able to take what had occured without much astonishment. However, the others that did not know the truth were extremely shocked.

They felt that regardless of how powerful the Infant Soul Sect might be, they would definitely not be able to compare to the allied army. They felt that Ying Mingchao would be able to exterminate all of them by himself.

However, judging the situation now, it was not as simple as they had anticipated. The Infant Soul Sect actually possessed a rank two True Immortal. This meant that they possessed strength on par with the tier one powers.

“Ying Mingchao, if you all wish to be our Infant Soul Sect’s honored guests, I will welcome you all.”

“However, if you want to harm the people of our Infant Soul Sect, then I, Hun Poyuan, will definitely not allow it.”

At this moment when the crowd were astonished, a figure flew out from Chen Heavenly City and arrived before the crowd’s field of view.

This person was also wearing a black gown. However, that identical black gown gave off an extraordinary presence when he wore it. It was incomparably domineering.

This person was a middle-aged man. He arrived before the crowd like a ruler descending upon the world.

Upon seeing this person, Chu Feng’s expression changed. While this person had the appearance of a middle-aged man, Chu Feng was able to tell that he was actually an old monster that had lived for close to ten thousand years.

With the strength this man possessed, he was most likely the actual master of the Infant Soul Sect.

After the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster appeared, several tens of thousands more people flew out from Chen Heavenly City. They arrived outside Chen Heavenly City following the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster and stood in confrontation against the allied army.

At this moment, not to mention those that didn’t know about the Infant Soul Sect, even the allied army felt an oppressive sensation.

Not only was the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster emitting the aura of a rank two True Immortal, but there were also four rank one True Immortals beside him. Two among them were people that Chu Feng knew. He had met them before at the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.

Like four guardians, the four rank one True Immortals stood on either side of the middle-aged man.

Apart from these five True Immortals, the strength of the army of tens of thousands that appeared together with them could not be underestimated either. They were actually all Martial Ancestors. Furthermore, there were over a thousand peak Martial Ancestor-level experts among them.

This was the main force of the Infant Soul Sect, a vicious, merciless yet powerful bunch.

However, one thing worthy of mentioning was that the appearance of the Infant Soul Sect army was different from when Chu Feng encountered them before.

Before, Chu Feng was able to sense a very intense heinous air from them. That heinous air originated from their use of infants to cultivate.

However today, none of them were actually emitting any heinous airs. They must’ve used some sort of special method to conceal it.

“There are quite a few old familiar faces here today. However, I know that many people here do not know of this old man.”

“Allow me to introduce myself. I am Hun Poyuan. I am the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. On behalf of the Infant Soul Sect, I welcome everyone that has arrived here today.”

Sure enough, that man by the name of Hun Poyuan was the sectmaster of the Infant Soul Sect.

“I truly never imagined for you all to all be here. This is the best, I am now able to completely exterminate all of you.”

Ying Mingchao did not feel the slightest favorable impression toward this Hun Poyuan’s self-introduction. Overwhelming killing intent emerged from Ying Mingchao, and an uncontrollable wild joy emerged in his eyes.

Based on his understanding of the Infant Soul Sect, practically everyone from the Infant Soul Sect had arrived today.

To Ying Mingchao, who planned to eradicate the Infant Soul Sect, this was extremely good news.
