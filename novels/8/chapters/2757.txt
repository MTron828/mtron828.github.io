Chapter 2757 - Descent Of A Celestial Fairy

As they saw the people from the Starfall Holy Land continue to proceed onward without the slightest intention of stopping, the expressions of anticipation on the faces of the crowd in the plaza all turned to disappointment.

The reason for that was because they felt that they would not be able see the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun’er.

It was only natural for them to be disappointed since the Holy Daughter passed by right before them.

Right at that moment, Han Yu shouted, “Miss Xia, please wait! It is I, Han Yu!”

After Han Yu spoke, many people present all cast appreciative gazes toward him.

After all, they felt that Han Yu’s action was simply giving great consideration to them. However, they had neglected the fact that Han Yu himself also wanted to see Xia Yun’er.

However, soon, the crowd discovered that even after Han Yu’s voice was heard, the people from the Starfall Holy Land continued onward without the slightest intention of stopping.

Seeing this, Han Yu was unable to keep his calm. After all, he had already made his declaration earlier. If Xia Yun’er was to really leave like this, he would have humiliated himself.

“Wait.”

Suddenly, right at the moment when Han Yu was worried, an incomparably sweet voice sounded from the sedan chair in the sky.

Hearing that voice, many of the younger generations present reacted with trembling. They were so excited that their hearts were on the verge of bursting out of their bodies.

The reason for that was because everyone knew that that was the voice of the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun’er.

After Han Yu spoke, Xia Yun’er actually really answered.

At that moment, many people of the younger generation were unable to contain themselves, and started gazing at Han Yu with admiration.

Seemingly sensing their gazes, the proud expression on Han Yu’s face grew even more intense.

However, the crowd had no idea that Han Yu was actually heaving a long sigh of relief in his heart. He was more afraid than anyone else that Xia Yun’er would leave just like that without bothering to stop at all.

Fortunately, Xia Yun’er actually ended up stopping.

Furthermore, a beautiful figure soon walked out from the sedan chair.

That woman was wearing a white dress. She was truly beautiful. She was akin to a celestial fairy.

This was especially true when compared to the other women present. Her beauty could be said to be universally shocking.

Seeing her, the heartbeats of many people present started to violently accelerate. They were so excited that they were on the verge of suffocation.

That woman was naturally one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Three Great Beauties, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter Xia Yun’er.

Compared to the others, Chu Feng did not react with excitement after seeing Xia Yun’er.

After all, this was already the third time he was seeing her.

Furthermore, although Xia Yun’er was beautiful, Chu Feng felt that, when comparing only beauty, there was still a disparity between Xia Yun’er and his Queen.

In fact, even when compared to Zi Ling, Xia Yun’er’s beauty would be slightly inferior.

Xia Yun’er’s beauty was more on the level of Su Rou, Su Mei and Xian Miaomiao.

Thus, at that moment, Chu Feng could not help but admire at the fact that even though the people from the Lower Realms possessed low levels of cultivation, they had quite a few beauties.

Chu Feng had already encountered beauties of Xia Yun’er’s level back in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. Thus, even when he saw Xia Yun’er for the first time, Chu Feng did not react in excitement like those people.

Although Chu Feng was not excited, it remained that Chu Feng’s heart was fluctuating.

At that moment, Chu Feng was feeling very uneasy from the bottom of his heart. Although that woman had a beauty akin to that of a pure and holy celestial fairy, Chu Feng had deemed her to be a poisonous woman. He did not know whether she would try to play a trick on him again.

“Young master, what a fated coincidence. I never expected to be able to meet you again here,” Xia Yun’er looked down and revealed a sweet smile.

Her smile was devastatingly beautiful. All of the men present were completely captivated by that smile.

Han Yu raised his hand and clasped his fist. With elegance, he replied, “It is indeed fate to be able to meet Miss Xia again here.”

At that moment, the crowd were no longer merely feeling admiration and adoration toward Han Yu.

Instead, they were feeling jealousy and envy now.

After all, Xia Yun’er was one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Three Great Beauties, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter.

To be able to converse with a beauty of her level was something that countless men would never dare to even dream of. Yet, Han Yu actually managed to accomplish it.

As such, how could the crowd not be jealous, not be envious?

Right at that moment, Xia Yun’er’s body shifted. From the sky, she gently descended to the ground.

She did not walk down. Instead, she descended like a celestial fairy.

Following closely behind her were the Starfall Eight Immortals and everyone else from the Starfall Holy Land. In an orderly manner, they flew down from the sky.

Seeing Xia Yun’er flying down, Han Yu grew even more pleased with himself. He first coughed proudly a couple times. Then, he tidied up his clothes to manifest his intention to meet Xia Yun’er with sincerity.

However, very soon, Han Yu’s expression changed.

The reason for that was because the more Xia Yun’er descended, the more he discovered that the direction of her descent was not toward him. Instead, it seemed like... she was descending toward Chu Feng.

At that moment, Han Yu started to panic. The reason for that was because Xia Yun’er was actually really descending toward Chu Feng. Furthermore, soon after, she landed before Chu Feng.

“Young master Chu Feng is truly reserved, you didn’t even bother to answer me when I spoke to you,” Xia Yun’er said to Chu Feng after landing before him.

“What? So the Holy Daughter’s words earlier were not meant for Han Yu, but rather for Chu Feng?”

“This means that the reason the Holy Daughter stopped was not because of Han Yu at all. Rather, it’s because she discovered Chu Feng?”

At that moment, the crowd came to a sudden realization, and were incomparably astonished. At the same time, they also began to spiritedly discuss this matter.

They finally realized why Xia Yun’er did not stop immediately after Han Yu shouted for her.

It turned out that she had no intention of paying Han Yu any attention at all. It was only when she discovered Chu Feng that she called for the sedan chair to be stopped.

Han Yu had also thought of this. Thus, Han Yu was feeling extremely embarrassed. His complexion had turned paper pale. He wished that there was a hole that he could hide in. He truly had no face to face the crowd.

Due to the fact that he was feeling extremely embarrassed, he became extremely furious, and stared at Chu Feng murderously.

Chu Feng’s perception was extremely sharp. He had managed to sense Han Yu’s gaze.

Sensing Han Yu’s gaze, Chu Feng felt very helpless. He had been afraid that this poisonous girl would play some sort of trick on him again, and sure enough, his guess had been correct.

Even though Han Yu disliked Chu Feng from the very beginning, Xia Yun’er’s actions had successfully intensified Han Yu’s enmity toward Chu Feng. Likely, this Han Yu would start to consider Chu Feng to be his irreconcilable enemy.

Xia Yun’er must’ve done this deliberately.

Suddenly, a Starfall Holy Land’s younger generation pointed at Chu Feng and shouted, “Hey! Our Lady Holy Daughter is speaking to you! Are you deaf?!”

He was feeling very displeased at how Chu Feng did not answer Xia Yun’er even after she spoke to him.

Actually, his reaction was understandable. After all, Xia Yun’er was someone who countless people sought to meet, but were unable to. Yet now, she had come to see Chu Feng out of her own initiative. However, Chu Feng actually refused to answer her. Naturally, the people from the Starfall Holy Land would feel very displeased with Chu Feng’s lack of action.

As for Chu Feng, even though he very much wanted to ignore Xia Yun’er, he could not be lacking in manners.

Moreover, it was thanks to Xia Yun’er’s advice that Chu Feng managed to hunt down that frightening World Spirit Beast.

Thus, Chu Feng forced a smile and clasped his fist at Xia Yun’er, “Miss Xia.”

“Young master Chu Feng, why are you all gathered here and not proceeding directly toward Buried Spirit Lake?” Xia Yun’er asked. Her beautiful eyes were flickering. Her every movement was so innocent. She caused the crowd present to be infatuated, head over heels in love with her. She had become the holy maiden in their hearts.

“We also do not know why. Merely, after we approached this place, we were forcibly drawn here by the spirit formation. The people from the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan only mentioned to us that a change had occurred to the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. Apart from that, they didn’t tell us anything,” Chu Feng said.

“So that’s the case, In that case, it would appear that I can’t proceed up the mountain directly either,” As Xia Yun’er spoke, she took a glance at the Starfall Eight Immortals.

The leader of the eight, that Elder Xingyi, nodded his head. Then, he opened his mouth and spoke with a voice even more ear-piercing than thunder. His voice resonated through the entire region.

“As the saying goes, those who have come are guests. The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan have not only shown the various guests here the cold-shoulder, but they actually didn’t even bother to provide an explanation. Is this how one should treat one’s guests?”

Right after Elder Xingyi’s words resonated through the surroundings, several figures soon emerged from a palace deep within the plaza. Those were all people from the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan.

“Lord Xingyi, please quell your anger. There is a reason why we have gathered the various guests here.”

An Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansman who lead the others began to provide an explanation as he quickly flew toward Elder Xingyi.

From his behavior, the crowd was able to see a single emotion: fear.

At that moment, the crowd were unable to contain themselves from gasping in admiration.

Thinking back, they too had sought after the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen to ask them about what was going on. Yet, they were only given half-hearted responses. In fact, the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen would even become impatient should they try to ask for details. They could be said to have been extremely rude and uncooperative.

Yet, with a single question from Elder Xingyi, they were scared to such a state. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The disparity was simply too enormous.
