Chapter 4229 - Ancient Compliance Castle

“Senior, what is that?”

Chu Feng couldn’t help but turn to Grandmaster Tang Chen to inquire about the incoming colossus.

He had discovered that the man-made colossus was protected by a spirit formation.

That spirit formation was extremely powerful, and far surpassed Chu Feng’s ability to see through.

With Chu Feng’s current ability, he was simply unable to see through the spirit formation.

Furthermore, the spirit formation was very well-hidden. If one didn’t observe the colossus carefully, they wouldn’t be able to detect the spirit formation at all.

Furthermore, after careful observation, Chu Feng was shocked to discover that the colossus actually contained an Ancient Era’s aura.

This meant that even if the master of the colossus was a modern cultivator, the colossus itself was something that had most likely originated from the Ancient Era.

This meant that it was a treasure in itself.

Chu Feng had never seen such an enormous treasure.

On top of that, it was composed of an extremely peculiar composition capable of causing one to be lost in wild and fanciful thoughts.

As such, compared to the master of the colossus, Chu Feng was more interested in the origin of the colossus itself.

“That is the Ancient Compliance Castle. It is Old Man Compliance’s temporary residence.”

“Old Man Compliance is not only a Martial Exalted-level expert, his world spirit techniques had also reached rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation many years ago.”

After saying those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen lowered his voice before continuing, “Furthermore, according to this old man’s speculation, that old codger’s world spirit techniques could have very possibly have reached rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation now.”

“Would that mean that he’s an existence on the same level as senior?” asked Chu Feng.

“Stop flattering me.”

“How could I possibly compare to him? Old Man Compliance is a true hidden expert of the Holy Light Galaxy.”

“He does not involve himself in any of the Holy Light Galaxy’s matters. He also won’t step into any remnants or places with treasures. Furthermore, he appears and disappears unpredictably, like a ghost.”

Chu Feng grew even more curious after hearing those words.

It turned out that not only was the mobile palace mysterious, its owner was also rather mysterious too.

“Senior, why are there so many people surrounding the Ancient Compliance Castle?”

“They’re acting like that Ancient Compliance Castle will present them with some sort of benefit?” asked Chu Feng.

A huge commotion was created by the appearance of the Ancient Compliance Castle.

At that moment it was being surrounded by a great number of world spiritists.

Although they were surrounding the Ancient Compliance Castle, they were also keeping their distance from it.

It seemed like they were waiting for something.

Judging from the excitement that those world spiritists were showing, it seemed like they were waiting for some sort of benefit.

“The reason why the Ancient Compliance Castle is called that, and the reason why Old Man Compliance is called as such, is all because of the word ‘Compliance,’” Grandmaster Tang Chen stroked his beard in a deliberately mystifying manner.

“Compliance?”

Chu Feng’s curiosity was roused. He was unable to take his eyes off Grandmaster Tang Chen, and awaited an answer.

“Old Man Compliance’s real name is Feng Moran.”

“Back then, by fate, he had obtained that ancient mobile castle.”

“That ancient castle contained an inexplicable power.”

“One thing worthy of mentioning is there’s a mirror inside the ancient castle. Should one stand before that mirror, the mirror will illuminate the treasure that that person needs the most.”

“Of course, that’s assuming that the ancient castle possesses that treasure.”

“That said, the ancient castle is filled with treasures. Likely, not even Old Man Compliance himself knows how many treasures there are.”

“The ancient castle does not have a name. It only possesses a single signboard. On that signboard the words ’Heavenly Compliance God’ are carved.

“Old Man Compliance believed the Heavenly Compliance god to be the owner of the ancient castle. On top of that, there’s that special mirror.”

“Because of that, he decided to name the ancient castle the Ancient Compliance Castle. From that day on, he also addressed himself as Old Man Compliance.”

“That said, it should actually be mentioned that he was actually very young back then,” Grandmaster Tang Chen said with a faint smile.

“Wouldn’t that mean that the Ancient Compliance Castle has numerous treasures, and is a treasure trove itself?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s correct. There were people that had wanted to steal the Ancient Compliance Castle from Old Man Compliance.”

“You should know that the martial cultivation world is one with no lack of greedy individuals. It was even more so when it’s a treasure trove from the Ancient Era.”

“But, without exception, all those that forcibly attacked the Ancient Compliance Castle were met with failure. They either died or were injured.”

“The Ancient Compliance Castle contains great power. It could be said that the Ancient Compliance Castle is as dangerous as the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.”

“Even for Martial Exalted-level experts, three were killed by the Ancient Compliance Castle.”

“That’s a greater number than the amount of Martial Exalted-level experts killed by the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“It’s that powerful?”

Chu Feng was curious about the Ancient Compliance Castle to begin with. Now that he had heard this description from Grandmaster Tang Chen, he had grown even more curious.

“The reason why those people all wanted to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle was because of that mirror.”

“Should one be able to successfully enter the Ancient Compliance Castle, they would be able to stand before the mirror.”

“That mirror will match one with the most suitable treasure.”

“Of course, one will have to rely on their own ability to obtain that treasure.”

“That said, there’s a requirement. Only those under six hundred years of age are allowed to step into the Ancient Compliance Castle,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Why under six hundred?” asked Chu Feng.

“I don’t know. But, it’s said that Old Man Compliance had obtained the Ancient Compliance Treasure when he was exactly six hundred years old.”

“As for the exact reason why, no one knows.”

“Not even Old Man Compliance knows,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“That’s very interesting.”

Chu Feng’s eyes continued to examine the Ancient Compliance Castle.

The Ancient Compliance Castle was now very close to Chu Feng.

Even though he had discovered that it possessed a boundless imposing aura, the oppressive sensation emitted by it was vastly different when it was near than when it was far away.

It was still unknown what the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain was like.

But, the Ancient Compliance Castle had given Chu Feng an impression of the fascination of the martial cultivation world.

Another treasure from the Ancient Era.

Another puzzle that modern cultivators could not decipher.

At the same time, he was reminded of just how small he was. Chu Feng grew motivated.

“Jingle, jingle---”

Suddenly, the bells on the Ancient Compliance Castle started to ring rhythmically.

Then, three flags rose from the Ancient Compliance Castle.

The three flags were all raised on the back of the colossus.

Each flag measured over a thousand meters in height. Moving with the wind, the flags appeared extremely impressive.

When he saw the three flags, Chu Feng’s gaze changed.

He discovered that there were two words written on one of the flags.

Lu Jie!

“Lu Jie?”

Chu Feng knew of Lu Jie. He was one of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s disciples.

He was also deemed to be the most talented world spiritist among the people of the younger generation.

Through the conversations that they’d had in their days traveling together, Chu Feng had also learned of Lu Jie’s special significance to Yuan Shu.

Back then, both Lu Jie and Yuan Shu had been deemed people of the younger generation with the greatest talent for world spirit techniques.

Unfortunately, Lu Jie’s talent had remained exceptional, whereas Yuan Shu’s had gradually fallen short.

At present, there was an enormous disparity between Lu Jie and Yuan Shu, two geniuses of a similar age.

Even though Yuan Shu always had a relaxed smile on his face when Lu Jie was mentioned, Chu Feng could tell from the expression in his eyes that Yuan Shu felt great pressure from Lu Jie.

Lu Jie was like a mountain crushing down on Yuan Shu.

Chu Feng wondered if the ‘Lu Jie’ on the flag was related to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s disciple Lu Jie. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Did that Lu Jie signify the renowned genius world spiritist of the Holy Light Galaxy, or did it signify something else?
