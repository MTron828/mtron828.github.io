Chapter 1933 - News From Far Away

“Why would this happen?”

Chu Feng was still holding onto the Evil God Sword. As he looked at the sword, the shock that Chu Feng felt increased even further.

As matters stood, Chu Feng was already certain that the Evil God Sword was most definitely not an Incomplete Imperial Armament, for its power was even more frightening than Imperial Armaments. That was something that Chu Feng had personally experienced when using the Evil God Sword to fight against the YinYang Immortal.

“Paa~~~”

“Clank~~~”

Right at that moment, Xian Miaomiao suddenly rushed over and swatted the Evil God Sword out of Chu Feng’s hand.

“Miaomiao, what are you doing?” Chu Feng had a confused expression.

“Chu Feng, that sword is too nefarious. You cannot use it. While all of the other Demon Armaments were fake, that sword is a real Demon Armament. It was even capable of devouring an Imperial Armament. Sooner or later, it will also devour you completely,” Xian Miaomiao shouted loudly. She was worried for Chu Feng because she was also deeply frightened by the Evil God Sword.

“It’s alright. I was only using it as an ordinary weapon, and did not unleash any of the sword’s actual power. As such, it will not cause any harm to me,” As Chu Feng spoke, he proceeded to move toward the Evil God Sword to pick it up.

“That still won’t do! Aren’t you unable to see how dangerous it is?!” Xian Miaomiao pulled Chu Feng back.

“Miaomiao, I know that it’s very dangerous. However, it remains that it is my sword, that it is a weapon that has recognized me as its master,” Chu Feng said.

“But it is a sword capable of devouring its master; even if it has recognized you as its master, it is still extremely dangerous,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“The people of the world all did not dare to touch it because they feared how dangerous it was.”

“If I am to act the same way, how would I be any different from the others? If I am to do that, I will really not be qualified to be its master,” Chu Feng still picked up the Evil God Sword.

The danger of the Evil God Sword had completely surpassed Chu Feng’s imagination. The Evil God Sword was a Demon Armament that Chu Feng was still incapable of controlling.

However, it was precisely because it was a Demon Armament that Chu Feng became eager to win against it and dominate it.

In fact, Chu Feng even felt that only a Demon Armament like the Evil God Sword was qualified to be his weapon.

“There’s truly nothing that I can do about you. However, it’s still better that you do not use it before you have sufficient strength. You are not allowed to use it again before you reach Half Martial Ancestor,” Xian miaomiao warned.

“Okay, okay, okay. I’ll keep that in mind,” Faced with the stubborn Xian Miaomiao, Chu Feng could only put the Evil God Sword away with a laugh. He also knew that Xian Miaomiao was thinking for his sake.

In fact, he was even able to guess that it was most definitely because of Xian Miaomiao’s assistance that he was able to feel better in the nightmare. The reason why he knew that was because he had felt a trace of Xian Miaomiao’s aura in the energy that he had felt in his dream.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, a golden ray of light sudden flew over. The speed of that golden ray of light was so fast that it caught both Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao off guard.

By the time the two of them managed to react, the golden ray of light had already arrived before them. Furthermore, it was now slowly revolving around Chu Feng.

“Golden Flash Bird. Chu Feng, that’s a Golden Flash Bird! It should be here for you, no?” Xian Miaomiao was truly very knowledgeable. She actually recognized the Golden Flash Bird with a single glance.

“It should be,” Chu Feng knew that this golden flash bird must have been dispatched by the Compass Immortal to bring him news. Thus, he placed his finger on the Golden Flash Bird.

“Buzz~~~”

Once he did so, Chu Feng immediately received the information the Golden Flash Bird carried. Although they were only a couple short sentences, they were sufficient to allow a boulder weighing down on Chu Feng’s heart to fall away.

“The people of the Cyanwood Mountain are safe and sound. They were not attacked by the Dark Hall. Nangong Longjian and I will guard the Cyanwood Mountain for an extended period of time. Do not worry. If you’re planning to return to the Cyanwood Mountain, bring Longjian’s wife and daughter with you so that they can reunite there.”

“It’s great that nothing happened,” After receiving this information, Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief.

Furthermore, it seemed that Nangong Longjian and the Compass Immortal were both planning to stay in the Cyanwood Mountain for an extended period of time to protect it. Chu Feng was extremely thankful for that.

“It flew away. That thing is so fast that I can’t catch it,” Xian Miaomiao returned from the outside.

It turned out that the Golden Flash Bird had flown away right after passing on the information to Chu Feng. Xian Miaomiao had gone after it to catch it. Unfortunately, she was unable to catch it.

“Chu Feng, exactly what information did the Golden Flash Bird bring?” Xian Miaomiao asked curiously.

“Earlier, my friends were attacked by the Dark Hall. I was worried that something would happen to the Cyanwood Mountain. Thus, I asked two seniors of mine to go and examine the situation at the Cyanwood Mountain.”

“That Golden Flash Bird brought news from them that the Cyanwood Mountain is safe and sound,” Chu Feng did not conceal anything.

“It’s great that nothing happened. The Dark Hall is truly too hateful. We Ancient Era’s Elves will definitely not let them get away,” Xian Miaomiao said as she clenched her little fists. However, she soon looked toward the direction where the Golden Flash Bird disappeared to and said, “The Golden Flash Birds are truly powerful. It was actually able to disregard the pressure of this place.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression immediately changed. Alarmed, he asked, “Miaomiao, could it be that we are still in the depths of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation?”

“That’s right. I was worried about you, so I did not leave the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. Thus, Lil Red helped me find a safe place to wait for you to awaken,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Crap,” Chu Feng started to tightly frown. Immediately after, he hurriedly walked over to the YinYang Immortal’s corpse and put it away.

At the same time, he removed the YinYang Immortal’s gown. He knew that the gown possessed the same usage as their Blood Devouring Armors, being able to withstand the pressure of this place. That was why the people from the Dark Hall were able to enter this place as well.

Chu Feng placed the gown on Xian Miaomiao. Then, using world spirit techniques, he made the gown fit Xian Miaomiao perfectly. After the gown had completely covered Xian Miaomiao, Chu Feng turned to LiL Red and asked, “Lil Red, do you know the quickest path to leave this place?”

“I do. I know everything. I am most familiar with this place,” Lil Red said complacently.

“Lead the way,” Chu Feng said.

“Sure thing,” Lil Red turned into a ray of red light and began to fly toward the horizon. Pulling Xian Miaomiao with him, Chu Feng began to closely follow Lil Red.

“Chu Feng, could it be that the effect of the Blood Devouring Armor is soon to disappear?” Xian Miaomiao was very smart. She was able to guess from how worried Chu Feng was.

“It’s alright, there’s still enough time,” Chu Feng said with a smile. He did not wish for Xian Miaomiao to be worried too.

However, seeing Chu Feng acting in such a way, Xian Miaomiao started to bite her lips. She felt very upset in her heart.

If it was really fine as Chu Feng had said, he would not have been so anxious earlier, nor would he have had her wear the YinYang Immortal’s gown.

Thus, she knew that the current situation was extremely dangerous. Although she would be fine, it was extremely dangerous for Chu Feng. As long as the Blood Devouring Armors reached their time limit, Chu Feng would be exposed to the pressure here, and would undoubtedly be killed.

Xian Miaomiao was feeling guilty and ashamed. Even though her perception was very strong, it was greatly inferior to Chu Feng’s. She was unable to determine the time limit of the Blood Devouring Armors. That was why she had caused this disaster.

“Paa~~~”

Suddenly, Xian Miaomiao grabbed Chu Feng’s hand and began to accelerate. With her other hand, she grabbed Lil Red and said to it,” Lil Red, give me directions, I’ll fly.”

“Righto,” Lil Red nodded. Then, it said excitedly, “Take the left, take the left. Go right, go right. Yep, yep, yep. Just like this. Go straight, go straight.” Lil Red was taking great pleasure in ordering Xian Miaomiao around. Evidently, Lil Red was not aware of the crisis.

“This girl,” Seeing how serious Xian Miaomiao was, Chu Feng revealed a slight smile on his face.

While Xian Miaomiao might appear to be very carefree, weird and unserious, she was someone who could be relied on in a moment of crisis.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
