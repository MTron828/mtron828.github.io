MGA: Chapter 1164 - If We’re Going To Do It, Then We’re Going Big

“What? Junior brother Chu Feng, you’ve also managed to break through in your cultivation?” Upon hearing what Bai Ruochen said, the crown all turned to Chu Feng. An even more surprised expression once again emerged on their already surprised faces.

Chu Feng did not deliberately reveal his cultivation like Bai Ruochen. Thus, no one present noticed that Chu Feng had managed to break through.

However, as Bai Ruochen spoke of it, they immediately started to inspect Chu Feng’s cultivation. Only then did they discover that Chu Feng’s cultivation had already broken through.

“Haha, this is truly great. The Second Head of our Asura Division is now a rank five Martial King and our Head is a rank two Martial King. That Dragon Tiger Division, even their strongest head is merely a rank four Martial King.”

“How could that Dragon Tiger Division possibly contend against our Asura Division? They actually dared to come and challenge our Asura Division, they’re simply courting death.”

At this moment, Fang Tuohai and the others were overjoyed. Without regard of the feelings of others, they actually started to cheer with loud voices.

As for the Second Head that he spoke of, it was naturally Bai Ruochen. As for the Head, it was Chu Feng.

Although he spoke those words with good intentions, it gave Chu Feng a weird feeling. While it was true that their Second Head’s cultivation was higher than their Head’s, there shouldn’t be a need for him to shout it that loudly, no?

As for Bai Ruochen, although she had not agreed to become the Asura Division’s Second Head, she did not deny the words spoken by Fang Tuohai.

It could be seen that her mood was extremely good. As for the reason why her mood was so good, it was naturally because she managed to break through twice in succession. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Chu Feng, let’s go and teach that Dragon Tiger Division a lesson,” said Bai Ruochen.

“There’s no need for us to urgently go to the Dragon Tiger Division. Let’s take care of these first,” said Chu Feng as he pointed at the profiles in Fang Tuohai’s hand.

“What exactly are you planning to do?” asked Bai Ruochen curiously. The crowd from the Asura Division also looked at Chu Feng. They too wanted to know what exactly Chu Feng was planning to do.

“You still don’t understand? It’s easy to teach the Dragon Tiger Division a lesson, that’s nothing more than a few seconds’ worth of time.”

“However, as they’re the first branch power organization that has come to challenge us, we definitely must not let them get away with it that easily.”

“I am going to use them to set an example, so that all those who know about our Asura Division, and all those that do not, will remember what happens if they were to challenge us, so that they can consider their own strength and abilities before doing so.”

“Thus, I am not going to the Dragon Tiger Division to take back our honor. What I plan to do is to extinguish the Dragon Tiger Division completely,” said Chu Feng.

“Extinguish completely?” Hearing those words, the expressions of the crowd, including Bai Ruochen, changed. That was because the words spoken by Chu Feng were truly fierce; could it be that he was planning to kill them?

Teaching them a lesson would be fine. After all, challenges were permitted. However, killing was absolutely out of question, as it was against the rules of the Cyanwood Mountain, something that they would definitely not allow.

“Don’t worry, what I meant by extinguish completely is to make the Dragon Tiger Division voluntarily dissolve. That’s the reason why I had you all gather this information. I am going to overturn all of the territories of the members of the Dragon Tiger Division.”

“In other words, I am going to destroy the homes of all the Dragon Tiger Division’s members. Furthermore, as long as they continue to stay in the Dragon Tiger Division, I will destroy their homes every day. Do you all understand my intentions now?” Chu Feng asked with a smile on his face.

“Junior brother Chu Feng, if you, you, you are to do something like that, I fear that you will become infamous. If the matter gets out of hand, I fear that the Orion Division will not stand by and watch.”

The crowd finally realized Chu Feng’s intentions. However, they were still deeply frightened by Chu Feng’s idea. Especially Fang Tuohai, he even spoke words to try to advise against it. That was because what Chu Feng was planning to do was definitely enormous.

Challenges, there were all kinds of challenges. However, something like what Chu Feng was proposing, to destroy the homes of all the branch power organization’s members, and threaten them with leaving the branch power organization or the destruction of their homes every day, was most definitely something that had never happened before. That was because this was truly too ruthless.

“What’s there to fear? It’s merely an insignificant Orion Division. Not to mention that this matter had been prompted by them from the shadows to begin with, regardless of what we do, they will not let us get away anyway.”

“Furthermore, even if the head of the Orion Monastery, Lei Yao, were to show up, what could he do? It is not necessary for our Asura Division to fear them.” Right when the majority of the crowd was worried, Bai Ruochen spoke out. Furthermore, with a very approving tone, she said. “Chu Feng, your idea is great. Let’s do what you suggest.”

“Everyone, you now know the method that I will use to settle this matter. As for what sort of consequences might occur after this is all done, I believe you all are able to guess that too.”

“I must admit that this matter is a bit dangerous. Furthermore, it is not a small amount of danger. Thus, if anyone wants to leave, I, Chu Feng, will definitely not stop them,” said Chu Feng to the crowd.

“No, we will definitely not leave.”

“That’s right. Let’s do it! Junior brother Chu Feng, whatever your decisions are, we will follow you.”

“That’s right, the worst result would only be that we’ll lose our lives. However, as long as we’ve lived them honorably and grandly, so what if we are to die?”

After Chu Feng said those words, the crowd started to give all kinds of different reactions. However, not only did none of them leave, their blood actually started to boil even further, filling them with the intention to fight.

“Very well, let’s go.” Seeing this, Chu Feng nodded his head in a satisfied manner. After that, his body moved, and he began to lead the way by flying into the sky.

Following behind him, several tens of figures also flew into the sky. With Chu Feng as their leader, they flew toward their distant destination.

At this moment, at this territory, other than Chu Feng’s servants, only the few people that had been mocking Chu Feng earlier remained.

Merely, at this very moment, their complexions were ash-gray. Fear filled their eyes. They truly regretted that they had looked down upon the Asura Division earlier...

“Who are you all? You actually dared to smash apart my territory’s entrance gates, do you know who I am?”

In a Cyanwood Mountain’s core region territory, a crafty looking female was shouting in fury as she looked at her shattered entrance gates and the several figures standing in the air.

She was a high-ranking member of the Dragon Tiger Division. She who had never feared anything naturally could not tolerate that there were people behaving atrociously in her territory. Moreover, as one’s entrance gates were akin to one’s own face, her entrance gates being smashed was akin to her face being slapped. Naturally, she could not tolerate that.

Thus, once she came out from her territory and discovered that her entrance gates had been smashed she did not bother to inspect the cultivations of the people who did it and directly lashed out at Chu Feng and the others standing in the air.

“Boom~~~~~~~” However, right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly shot out his palm. Once that palm landed, an overflowing explosive sound emerged. At the same time, the entire piece of land started to tremble violently. Like an earthquake, numerous cracks and tears appeared on the ground.

Turning her face to look, the expression of the woman from the Dragon Tiger Division took a huge change. At this very moment, thick smoke filled the area behind her.

All of the buildings in her territory have turned to ashes. Only her servants flew out from the thick smoke. Their bodies were covered all over with dust; it was truly a sorry state.
