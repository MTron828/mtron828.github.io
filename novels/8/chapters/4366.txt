Chapter 4366: Tortured

“The situation just keeps getting worse.”

Even though Chu Feng was maintaining a poker face all this while, in his mind, he was already thinking about how he could escape from this place.

Even though that cultivator’s strength still wasn’t very stable after he used his talent to forcefully enhance his cultivation, that was still a rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivator over there.

If the other party was only at rank five, Chu Feng could still barely match him, but against a rank six, he really didn’t stand a chance at all.

Under such circumstances, the only option Chu Feng had on hand was to flee.

However, he couldn’t do so immediately. If the other party were to notice his fear, they would immediately seal off all of his escape routes.

Boom!

All of a sudden, the surrounding air trembled. That cultivator had released his oppressive might to suppress Chu Feng.

He wasn’t intimidated by Chu Feng’s calm front. Instead, he decided to make a move right away.

Chu Feng was unable to withstand the impact of the oppressive might at all, and he immediately fell to the ground.

His tendons snap, and he began to spit out blood frenziedly. In just a short moment, he was already severely injured. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Chu Feng’s mastery of world spiritist techniques had already reached rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation, and paired with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and his world spiritist bloodline, his fighting prowess was comparable to that of a rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivator.

However, his real cultivation was still only at rank one Utmost Exalted level.

Even if he could raise his cultivation through the Divine-level Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and the Four Symbols Divine Power, at the very most, his cultivation would only be comparable to a rank four Utmost Exalted level cultivator. There was no way he would have been able to put up a fight against a rank six.

“Damn it! I should have been warier,” Chu Feng murmured with a tight frown on his forehead.

Those disciples were more familiar than him regarding this place, so it was likely that they had known all this while that this place had the ability to seal off one’s spirit power.

“It looks like I have gambled correctly. You do have powerful spirit power, but your cultivation doesn’t seem to be anything much.”

The cultivator gazed down at Chu Feng with a triumphant smirk on his face.

“Senior Ma, you are really formidable! I didn’t know that you have managed to awaken your innate talent, allowing you to raise your cultivation by a rank!”

“Senior Ma, you have really hidden your trump card well!”

The other disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo swiftly rained compliments down on that cultivator, who seemed to be known as Senior Ma.

As it turned out, Senior Ma had been hiding his strength all along, such that even his fellow disciples weren’t aware that he had such a talent.

“I’ve only awakened this talent not too long ago. Even though I can raise my cultivation through it, it’s still not too stable at the moment. That’s why, after I learned that this fellow was able to defeat Senior Lu, I didn’t make a move against him right away.

“Initially, I was planning to go all-out against this fellow if he were to intend to kill us, but I didn’t think this fellow would be so greedy as to actually eye the treasure! All of us are aware that the formation set up by the sectmaster has sealed off spirit power in this valley due to special reasons, so I thought of giving it a try and see if that fellow would still be that powerful after his spirit power has been sealed.

“From the looks of it now, it seems like I have gambled correctly. He might be a formidable world spiritist, but his cultivation sure doesn’t look like anything much. Even though my power is not stable after forcefully rising my cultivation to rank six, it’s more than enough to curb this fellow!” Senior Ma explained gleefully.

“Senior Ma, you are too amazing! Everything has been in your control all along!”

“Senior Ma, you’re really our savior. If we had really brought him to where the main formation is, all of us would have surely been killed by the sectmaster for betraying the sect!”

“Yes, Senior Ma! You have really saved all of us today!”

The disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo were more than happy to see such a situation, and they felt grateful to Senior Ma for bringing them out of that difficult position they were in.

They didn’t think that there would still be such a turnaround to the situation. They were actually thinking of really bringing Chu Feng over to the main formation.

“We’re one family. There’s no need for you to say such words. But as for that fellow, he sure has guts to dare mess with our Soaring Flower Gazebo and kill Senior Lu. It looks like he doesn’t know his own place!

“Juniors, I think that before we hand him over to the Supreme Elders to deal with, we have a responsibility to let him know just what kind of power our Soaring Flower Gazebo is!”

As Senior Ma spoke, a cold smile formed on his lips.

“Yes, we have to teach him a lesson that he’ll never forget!”

The disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo nodded their heads in agreement as malicious looks appeared on their faces too. All of them began taking out their weapons and tools from their Cosmos Sack.

There were toxic, venomous worms, poison pills, and all sorts of oddly-shaped weapons.

But without a doubt, all of these items were used for torture.

“Oh? What’s with that expression on your face? Weren’t you acting all smug a moment ago, as if all of our hands are you in grasp? Didn’t you threaten to kill all of us earlier?” Senior Ma looked at Chu Feng with a smug smile.

“Cut the crap and do your worst! If I were to make the slightest noise, I wouldn’t be known as Chu Feng!” Chu Feng spat with spunk.

The formation here was simply too complex that Chu Feng didn’t realize that this valley would seal off spirit power. He was too caught up with wanting to obtain the treasure that he let down his guard and went along with the flow, eventually landing in his current state.

It was too late for regrets now.

But even if he were to be cornered, he would never beg this bunch of people for mercy. If he must die, he was determined to die with dignity.

That was Chu Feng’s final obstinacy.

“Chu Feng, is that your name? Very well, I shall remember it then! Let’s see if you really won’t make any noise at all!”

Right after saying those words, a vicious glint flickered across Senior Ma’s eyes as he flicked his wrist ferociously.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh.

Countless black blades rained down on Chu Feng, piercing through his body in a heartbeat.

These sharp blades did more than injuring one’s physical body, it also damaged one’s soul too.

This single strike had already blurred the boundaries between Chu Feng’s blood and flesh, causing him to look utterly gruesome. But despite the cruelty that had just happened, Chu Feng actually didn’t even let out a single whimper.

The first thought that came to the minds of all of the disciples was that Chu Feng had already fainted from the pain.

After all, they recognized the weapon used by Senior Ma, and it was known to inflict piercing pain right toward its target’s soul. It was an item that he reserved specifically to torture those who dared to go against him.

It was rumored that the pain it inflicted was enough to drive its victims mad.

But when they took a closer look, they found that even though Chu Feng was in a terrible state, he was still conscious. There was a pair of unyielding eyes still staring right at them.

Despite being put through such great pain, he actually gritted his teeth and endured it without making any noise at all.
