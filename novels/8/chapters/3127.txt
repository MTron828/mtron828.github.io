Chapter 3127 - Plead Bitterly

Chu Shuangshuang had called to Chu Feng’s attention to what had happened because she wanted to have him help think of a solution. After all, Chu Feng possessed remarkable abilities.

However, she had not expected Chu Feng to jump into danger himself to find Chu Ping and the others.

It would be one thing if Chu Feng was able to return safely. However, if an accident were to occur, it would mean that she would be the one that had harmed Chu Feng.

Thinking of that, Chu Shuangshuang took a leap forward and also entered the central region of the undercurrent. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She had made her decision. No matter what sort of path was ahead of her, no matter if it was danger or an opportunity, she would face it together with Chu Feng and the others.

After entering the central region of the undercurrent, Chu Feng was restricted by an enormous power. He was no longer capable of breaking free, and could only drift with the flow of the water.

This situation lasted for two whole hours. After two hours passed, the speed of the water restricting Chu Feng began to slow down.

Finally, Chu Feng regained his liberty. At that moment, Chu Feng discovered that he had arrived at the end of the undercurrent.

He did not see Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu there.

Chu Feng was not surprised by their disappearance.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng felt a source of natural energies much more intense than the natural energies from the undercurrent of the Immortal River there.

The natural energies were coming from a nearby cave. That cave was very small. Perhaps only a single person could pass through it at a time. However, it was precisely that small cave that was giving off natural energies that were much more intense than those of the undercurrent Immortal River.

Chu Feng carefully sensed the cave. Sure enough, he sensed the auras of Chu Qing and the others from that cave.

Thus, Chu Feng was certain that Chu Qing, Chu Ping, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu had entered that cave following the natural energies.

“This place is already no longer within the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory. Yet they still dare to move about this rashly?”

“It is one thing for Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu to not understand the rules. However, how could Chu Qing and Chu Ping also not understand the rules?” Chu Feng revealed a slight frown. He was getting agitated.

Based on his awareness as a world spiritist, Chu Feng felt that the intense natural energies coming from the cave were somewhat fishy.

Perhaps there was some sort of danger hidden in there. However, Chu Ping and the others had actually acted so rashly as to enter a place like that. As such, how could Chu Feng not feel angry?

Whilst Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu might act rashly out of ignorance, Chu Ping should know the rules of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm very well.

Even though he was feeling irritated, Chu Feng could not ignore them. As such, he began to walk toward the cave.

After Chu Feng passed through the narrow cave tunnel, he entered a vast cave.

Upon arriving, the aura of the natural energies became even more intense. However, whilst the natural energies were powerful, one could not train with them.

In other words, the enormously powerful natural energies were like a sort of bait. Only by finding its source would one be able to train.

Chu Feng became even more certain that there was some sort of hidden danger to the natural energies there.

However, there was nothing he could do. Even though Chu Feng knew of the dangers, he still had to move onward.

However, Chu Feng had no idea that there was another group of people inside the cave.

This group of people were all wearing the same cyan gown. Their cyan gowns were covered with cyan feathers, giving the gowns a very unique look.

Apart from the eye-catching cyan-feathered gowns, they were also wearing identical hats on their heads.

Those hats were pointy, and three feet tall. However, apart from the special appearance of the hats, there was nothing special to them. However, inscribed on the front of the hats in a very eye-catching manner was the word ‘Cyanfeather.’

That group of people were currently standing in an orderly manner. Kneeling before them were four people.

Those four people were not only badly battered, but their bodies were also covered in blood.

As for those four people, they were none other than Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.

The four of them were evidently forcibly brought to their knees by someone’s powerful oppressive might.

The reason for that was because Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu all had furious looks on their faces, and surging killing intent in their eyes.

There was only a single person that was different - Chu Ping.

“Milords, please, I beg of you all, please spare us. We really did not intend to intrude into your territory,” even though Chu Ping was badly beaten, he was not angry in the slightest, and was instead begging for forgiveness.

The reason for that was because Chu Ping knew very well how frightening the people before him were.

This group of people were from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. As for the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, they were a group with enormous power in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Eastern Region.

Even the Burnfield Monstrous Clan that was bullying their Chu Heavenly Clan was only capable of doing so with the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan standing behind their back.

From this, one could imagine how enormous the disparity between the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan and their Chu Heavenly Clan was.

That was also the reason why Chu Ping would disregard his dignity and plead bitterly to them.

Unfortunately, even though Chu Ping was begging like that, the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan did not take his begging to heart at all.

“No intention just because you all were caught by us? Why don’t you tell me how you all managed to come to this place?” Someone from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s group said.

“We discovered an undercurrent of the Immortal River in our clan’s territory. Merely, that undercurrent of the Immortal River was too powerful, and ended up sucking us into it. We were brought to your territory by the power of the undercurrent.”

“However, the power of that undercurrent was simply too powerful. We were unable to return. Even flying was impossible, because even the surrounding walls were incredibly hard. This led to us being trapped in here.”

“Fortunately, we found a cave. We entered the cave to look for a way out. That is how we arrived at this place. We truly did not intend to intrude into your territory. We were truly forced with no other choice.”

“Milords, you must definitely believe us,” Chu Ping pleaded.
