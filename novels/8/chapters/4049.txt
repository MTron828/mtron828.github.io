Chapter 4049 - In Raging Anger

“So the two forbidden medicines are complementary, and can be taken in succession without too intense of a backlash.”

“Forbidden medicines like those are truly rare. They can even be classified as treasures.”

“Unfortunately, they’re wasted,” Chu Feng said as he looked to Wuming Doutian with an unchanged expression after hearing the crowd’s questioning voices.

“Waste?” Wuming Doutian’s expression changed. He was confused by Chu Feng’s words.

“You shouldn’t have used those forbidden medicines to fight me.”

“Using them will be of no use. Relying only on the power of forbidden medicines will not be able to change anything.”

Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that Wuming Doutian was putting on a deliberate show.

His two forbidden medicines were one to begin with. Thus, taking them in succession would cause an extra burden upon his body right away, but they would also increase his battle power again.

“The ironclad evidence is right in front of your face, yet you’re still attempting to frame me?”

“Brat, your moral character is truly vile.”

“If the Ancestral Martial Starfield is to be handed over to someone like you, wouldn’t it become a place where right and wrong cannot be distinguished, where chaos and crimes run amok?”

“Today, I must teach you a lesson. Else, it will be detrimental to your future.”

“Boom~~~”

After Wuming Doutian said those words, heaven and earth started to tremble.

It was Wuming Doutian. His aura had changed.

There was already no need to mention how powerful he’d been before. However, at that moment, his oppressive might also possessed a sort of despotic strength.

It was a sense of overbearing might that seemed to rule everything in the world.

This caused the crowd to once again recall his identity.

He was not an ordinary martial cultivator. He was someone who had ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield as its overlord for over ten thousand years.

No matter how heaven-defying Chu Feng’s talent might be, he was, at least for the moment, no match for the starfield’s overlord.

After sensing Wuming Doutian’s overwhelmingly oppressive aura, the crowd were unable to keep themselves from turning their gazes over to Chu Feng. Looks of sympathy appeared in their eyes. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

They all felt that he would soon pay for what he had done.

The Realm Master had been enraged by him!

“Heh...”

However, to the crowd’s surprise, not only was Chu Feng not worried, he even laughed.

His laughter was even more resounding than thunder. His action was incomprehensibly crazy.

Everyone was puzzled by his behavior.

He was clearly in imminent danger, yet he still dared to laugh?

Suddenly, Chu Feng stopped laughing. His gaze turned bitingly cold.

Like two blades of ice, they shot straight forward and froze the surroundings.

This change shook the crowd’s hearts, and they ineffably felt fear.

“Teach me a lesson?”

“The way I see it, you’re trying to use the forbidden medicines’ power to kill me, right?”

“Only by killing me, this threat will you be able to continue to rule over the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Just like how you tried to eliminate my grandfather and father back then,” said Chu Feng.

“To speak of impudent nonsense, you ought to be punished!”

“Clank~~~”

As Wuming Doutian spoke, the air before him split apart. It was the black spear in his hand. It had shot towards Chu Feng.

There were purple gaseous flames hovering around the black spear.

“Lord Realm Master!”

Seeing the purple flames on the black spear, the expressions of some of the Wuming Clan’s top experts changed enormously.

They knew that what was enveloping the spear were no ordinary purple flames; it was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

It was one of their Wuming Clan’s strongest martial skills, one of their clan-protection martial skills, the Exalted Taboo: Purple Dragon Flame.

The complete form of the Exalted Taboo: Purple Dragon Flame was that of a giant purple dragon.

Wuming Doutian had adhered his Exalted Taboo: Purple Dragon Flame to his Incomplete Exalted Armament. Although it would not reveal the giant purple dragon, its might did not weaken in the slightest.

Wuming Doutian had done this on purpose. He was deliberately not revealing the complete state of his Exalted Taboo: Purple Dragon Flame’s overwhelming might.

With that, apart from the top experts of his Wuming Clan, the bystanders would not be able to tell that he had used an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, an extremely powerful attack, to attack Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was correct. Wuming Doutian did not plan to let him live..

He was trying to use ‘teaching him a lesson’ as a pretext to eliminate him.

Wuming Doutian’s spear was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it had arrived before Chu Feng.

The spear was very powerful. If Chu Feng were struck by it, his soul would shatter, his body would explode, and he would die.

“Buzz~~~”

However, after the Exalted Taboo Martial Skill-attached Incomplete Exalted Armament arrived before Chu Feng, it suddenly stopped.

Furthermore, it did not give rise to the slightest energy ripple.

Because of that, the crowd were able to see... the purple flames Wuming Doutian had attached to his black spear.

They were also able to see that the black spear was aimed at Chu Feng’s dantian.

Was this really only teaching Chu Feng a lesson?

“How could this...”

Wuming Doutian’s expression changed enormously.

He knew very well how powerful the forbidden medicines he had taken were.

After taking the first forbidden medicine, his battle power would double.

After taking the second forbidden medicine, his already increased battle power would be doubled again.

Since he was able to suppress Chu Feng after taking the first forbidden medicine, he should be fully capable of easily obliterating him after taking the second one.

Furthermore, his attack was one he had put all of his strength into. He had used both his Incomplete Exalted Armament and one of his strongest Exalted Taboo Martial Skills to attack Chu Feng.

Yet, his all-out attack was so easily blocked?

With that, Wuming Doutian started to panic slightly.

If he failed to defeat Chu Feng at that moment, it would be extremely difficult for him to do so in the future.

In fact, it could be said that if he failed to defeat Chu Feng, he would no longer possess any hope of defeating him.

Because of that, he could not concern himself with shame and what other people would think of him. He began to control his Incomplete Exalted Armament with all his strength to attack Chu Feng again.

With his all-out control, the black spear started to twist. Sparks began to scatter everywhere from the tip of the spear.

Yet, even though there was nothing ahead of it, the black spear reacted as if it had struck an invisible and impregnable wall.

No matter how much power Wuming Doutian poured into the spear, he was unable to pierce through the invisible wall.

“Are you still bothering with needless struggles?”

A smile appeared on Chu Feng’s face as he said those words.

Seeing that smile, Wuming Doutian realized the disparity between him and Chu Feng.

“Could it be that your previous exhausted and beaten appearance was nothing more than a deliberate disguise?” Wuming Doutian asked all of a sudden.

“Seems like you’re not stupid,” The smile on Chu Feng’s face grew even denser.

“Damn it!”

Wuming Doutian gnashed his teeth with rage and cursed out loud.

It turned out, he had been toyed with by Chu Feng.

His earlier appearance of imminent defeat was nothing more than a disguise.

Being able to easily block his full power attack, that was Chu Feng’s actual strength.

“You damned bastard! I’ll kill you! I must kill you!”

Wuming Doutian was thoroughly enraged. He was no longer trying to be secretive about his desire to kill Chu Feng. Instead, he had decided to reveal his true nature, reveal everything.

He unleashed his killing intent. The purple flames on the black spear turned into a giant purple dragon.

Everyone present felt his killing intent. They were all able to tell that he truly intended to kill Chu Feng.

The surrounding space was shattering under the pressure of Wuming Doutian’s attack. Yet, Chu Feng was completely unscathed.

In fact, Wuming Doutian’s spear was unable to proceed even the slightest bit further.

“Amazing. Never would I have imagined that Chu Feng is actually this powerful.”

“Even after taking a forbidden medicine, Wuming Doutian is actually still unable to match Chu Feng!”

The crowd finally realized what was happening. They finally realized who between Chu Feng and Wuming Doutian was stronger, and who was weaker.

Hearing the crowd’s discussions and seeing the relaxed look and mocking smile on Chu Feng’s face, Wuming Doutian grew so furious that he felt his heart, liver, spleen, kidney and lungs were on the verge of exploding.

His body was violently trembling from rage.

“Bastard! Bastard! I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!”

“I failed to kill your grandfather, failed to kill your father, but today, I will definitely kill you!”

In a furious rage, Wuming Doutian swept his palm across his Cosmos Sack. Then, a crimson medicinal pellet appeared in his hand.

That was another forbidden medicine.

“Lord Realm Master, you absolutely mustn’t!”

Seeing that forbidden medicine, the experts of the Wuming Clan were all terrified. They all shouted at Wuming Doutian hysterically in an attempt to stop him.

Yet, Wuming Doutian did not hesitate at all. He directly tossed the forbidden medicine into his mouth and swallowed it.
