Chapter 2242 - A Helping Hand

“It would seem that Li Rui was indeed at fault for this matter. I will report this matter to our Valley Master honestly.”

“Furthermore, our Valley Master is not someone who cannot distinguish between right and wrong. Thus, little friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. Our Sunset Cloud Valley will definitely not look further into this matter,” Elder Ning Shuang said to Chu Feng.

It was not that he did not mind Li Rui’s death. After all, Li Rui was a talented individual. As such, how could he not be pained by Li Rui’s death?

However, from the process of what had happened, it was obvious at a glance who was in the wrong and who was in the right. Everyone present was able to tell. Thus, even if their Sunset Cloud Valley was feeling unreconciled, it would still not be suitable for them to look further into this matter.

Furthermore, from their short interaction, Elder Ning Shuang was very fond of Chu Feng. As such, he truly did not wish to look further into this matter.

“Chu Feng, and here I thought that you would not dare to come out!!!”

Right at that moment, a voice filled with killing intent suddenly exploded. Following that, four figures rapidly approached. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It was the Four World Spiritist Emperors. Those four brothers were actually daring enough to attack Chu Feng before he had even left the vicinity of Mount Cloud Crane.

“Stay your hand,” Upon seeing that, Elder Ning Shuang hurriedly moved before Chu Feng, blocking him.

He also unleashed his aura of a rank five Martial Ancestor and completely dispersed the surging oppressive might from the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

While the Four World Spiritist Emperors were very powerful, their eldest being a rank five Martial Ancestor, Elder Ning Shuang was also a rank five Martial Ancestor.

[1.This is not a mistranslation. Bee had mistaken their cultivation. On ch 2224, he mentioned all four of them were rank 1 Martial Ancestors, which makes sense since he mentioned the 2nd eldest is a rank 1 in many chapters and the four of them are quadruplets. However, now the eldest is a rank five instead?]

As such, he would naturally not look on helplessly as they attempted to bring harm to Chu Feng.

“Scram! You are but a dog of the Sunset Cloud Valley, yet you dare oppose us?”

However, who would’ve thought that the Four World Spiritist Emperors would completely disregard Elder Ning Shuang? In fact, they did not even place the Sunset Cloud Valley in their eyes.

“Don’t you think about harming little friend Chu Feng,” Elder Ning Shuang said determinedly.

“You are truly one who will not shed a tear until you see your coffin. If my mother is to be angered, not to mention you, your entire Sunset Cloud Valley will not be able to bear the consequences.”

Hearing those words, Elder Ning Shuang’s gaze wavered. If it were the Four World Spiritist Emperors alone, he would indeed be capable of handling them. However, upon mentioning their mother, Elder Ning Shuang started to waver before them.

The reason for that was because not only was the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, she also possessed extremely powerful strength in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. She could be considered an influential individual in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

She was indeed not someone that he could afford to provoke.

Seeing that Elder Ning Shuang was starting to panic, the Four World Spiritist Emperors grew even more arrogant. Their eldest pointed to Elder Ning Shuang’s nose and said, “Old dog from the Sunset Cloud Valley, scram immediately and I will pretend like nothing has happened.”

“You!!!” Elder Ning Shuang was so furious his complexion turned red. However, in the end, he resisted the anger, and did not erupt.

“What about me? Scram right now. Else, do not blame me for being rude toward you,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said fiercely. His arrogance was completely revealed.

“I’ve finally managed to catch you all!!!”

However, right at that moment, a voice exploded like a thunderbolt. Even space itself started to tremble violently.

Turning toward the direction of the voice, everyone saw that it was actually Daoist Three Swords.

“Crap!” Upon seeing Daoist Three Swords, the expressions of the Four World Spiritist Emperors all changed enormously.

They had left an enormous grievance against Daoist Three Swords on Mount Cloud Crane. Thus, it was extremely bad for them to encounter him here.

“I said that I would let you know what miserable really means after leaving Mount Cloud Crane,” Daoist Three Swords said to the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

“Daoist Three Swords, you are, after all, a senior. Are you planning to bully your juniors?” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors started to panic. He turned around and prepared to flee.

“Humph, this Daoist has always been one to keep his word. Since I have said that I will teach you a lesson, how could I possibly spare you all just because of my seniority?” Daoist Three Swords sneered. Then, he began to walk toward the Four World Spiritist Emperors in midair. Although his footsteps appeared to be slow, he traversed several miles with each step. In merely the blink of an eye, he managed to catch up to the fleeing eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor.

“Pow, pow, pow, pow~~~”

After arriving before the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, Daoist Three Swords began to swing his arms to unleash ruthless slaps to his face.

Not only were his slaps resounding, they were also very powerful. In merely a short moment, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was slapped dazed. Blood covered his face as he swayed from side to side before losing consciousness. From midair, he began to fall to the ground.

“Big brother!!!”

Seeing that the situation was bad, the three younger brothers immediately rushed to catch their big brother.

“Woosh~~~”

However, right when they were about to catch their big brother, a figure suddenly appeared before them, blocking their path.

Upon seeing that person, the expressions of the three brothers all turned ashen.

The reason for that was because that person was none other than Daoist Three Swords.

“Since you’re blood brothers, you shall naturally share in your punishments.”

“Since your eldest brother has fainted, the three of you shall receive the following punishments on his behalf,” After Daoist Three Swords said those words, he did not bother to wait for the three brothers to reply, and began to flail his arms about nonstop, leaving countless blurs in their path.

“Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow,” firecracker-like sounds began to explode nonstop.

During that period of time, the three brothers’ heads were beaten back and forth as their blood splattered all over.

When Daoist Three Swords stayed his hand, those three brothers had also fainted. From midair, they all smashed into the ground beside their eldest brother.

Seeing this scene, many people began to applaud in their hearts. After all, Daoist Three Swords’ slaps were truly satisfying to the heart; he had helped the crowd settle the arrogance of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

“Wow! Chu Feng, Daoist Three Swords actually helped you take care of the Four World Spiritist Emperors!” Xu Yiyi said excitedly.

“As if. The way I see it, it’s because they possessed personal conflicts. How could Daoist Three Swords help a nobody like Chu Feng?” Jiang Hao said with an expression of denial.

However, who would’ve thought that, right at that moment, Daoist Three Swords stepped into the air and began walking toward Chu Feng’s direction. Furthermore, he ended up stopping before Chu Feng.

“Little brother Chu Feng, rest assured. I have struck them unconscious with my martial power.”

“Unless someone is to treat them, they will definitely be unconscious for several days and nights. At the very least, they will no longer pose a threat to you today,” Daoist Three Swords said to Chu Feng.

At that moment, many of the people present had their eyes wide open and their tongues tied. This was especially true for the people that had not entered Mount Cloud Crane. At that moment, they had bewildered expressions.

As matters stood, they were all certain that Daoist Three Swords had not attacked the Four World Spiritist Emperors for no reason or cause. Instead, he had actually done so to help Chu Feng out of his trouble.

Merely, they did not understand how Chu Feng had managed to claim a connection to a grand individual like Daoist Three Swords.

Feeling extremely grateful, Chu Feng hurriedly bowed to Daoist Three Swords, “Thank you senior.”

“The four of them were disrespectful toward their seniors. They were truly excessive. Even if they did not attempt to cause trouble for you, I still would have had to teach them a lesson. Else, if they were allowed to continue to act unrestrained like that, they might end up causing countless evils,” Daoist Three Swords said carefreely.

However, his expression suddenly changed. He turned serious and said, “Little brother Chu Feng, might you be interested in coming to our Immortal Sword School as a guest?”

Hearing those words, the already-astonished crowd opened their mouths wide with shock.

This was especially true for Jiang Hao. He had an expression as if he had just been fed feces.

No one would’ve thought that not only would Daoist Three Swords lend Chu Feng a helping hand, he would even voluntarily invite Chu Feng to be a guest of their Immortal Sword School.

That could be said to be a supreme honor!!!
