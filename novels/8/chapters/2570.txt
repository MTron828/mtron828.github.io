Chapter 2570 - Blue Gown Appearing On The Stage

“Xunyi, wait.”

Ying Mingchao hurriedly moved before Zi Xunyi to stop her.

At that moment, he had a lot of things that he wanted to say. However, as he saw Zi Xunyi, as he saw Xuelin Zhenping’s corpse that she was carrying in her hands, Ying Mingchao was unable to utter a single word.

However, Ying Mingchao did not wish for Zi Xunyi to leave. The reason for that was because he knew that if she were to leave now, they would never meet again.

Thus, Ying Mingchao clenched his teeth and said, “Xunyi, I am regretful. I should not have sought after fame and riches. I should not have been infatuated with martial cultivation.”

“My decision back then was wrong. Could you please give me another chance?”

“Xunyi, let us leave together. I will follow you wherever you go. I will never leave you for the rest of my life.”

Ying Mingchao spoke those words very emotionally. He was not lying; those words were spoken from the bottom of his heart.

However, he spoke those words in a slightly timid manner. Perhaps he was scared, scared of being rejected by Zi Xunyi after speaking his inner feelings. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zi Xunyi stood there stunned. Chu Feng was able to see that her eyes had turned slightly red. Then, two lines of tears rolled down her cheeks.

She was crying. She was crying so much that her body was twitching.

One could imagine what sort of struggle she was going through in her current state of mind.

The man before her was the man that she had loved deeply for over a thousand years. He was the person that she had wanted to spend the rest of her life with the most.

However, she was unable to let go of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. Although she did not love the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, she felt deep guilt for him.

After a long moment of silence, Zi Xunyi said, “If you really care about my feelings, let me go.”

She said those words with a smile on her face. Her eyes were also looking at Ying Mingchao.

While her smile might be forced, it did seem like she had managed to let go of something.

As a spectator, Chu Feng was able to see the situation between Zi Xunyi and Ying Mingchao more clearly. As such, he was able to tell that Zi Xunyi had forced that smile.

However, being put on the spot, Ying Mingchao started to hesitate. He naturally cared about Zi Xunyi’s feelings. Thus, he did not wish to go against her desires, nor did he wish to force her.

Thus, he stood to the side and opened up a path for Zi Xunyi.

He handed a communication talisman to Zi Xunyi and said, “Keep it with you. If you are to encounter any trouble, notify me.”

“There’s no need,” After Zi Xunyi said those words, she soared into the sky with Xuelin Zhenping’s corpse in hand. She had left.

Ying Mingchao continued to stand there. He did not even move in the slightest. His hand with the communication talisman was still extended.

After a long time...

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

......

Right at that moment, a series of sharp and clear claps suddenly sounded.

Turning toward the claps, Chu Feng’s expression immediately changed.

A figure was standing in the direction where the claps had sounded from.

Although that individual was clearly standing there, Chu Feng did not notice him at all. If it weren’t for the sudden claps, Chu Feng would have had no idea that there was actually someone standing there.

As for the reason why Chu Feng was so astonished, it was not because that man was extremely powerful. Rather, it was because that man was wearing a blue gown.

That blue gown was exactly the same as the blue gown of the mysterious individual described by Kong Doumoyuan.

“That was truly quite an emotional and passionate scene.”

“That was most definitely the most emotional and passionate love triangle that I’ve ever seen in my life.”

“Two men both loved one woman so much. Unfortunately, in the end, neither man managed to obtain her.”

“Tragic, truly tragic. Pitiful, truly pitiful.”

The mysterious blue-gowned individual spoke insipidly. It was as if he had just witnessed a great show, and was giving his evaluation.

“Courting death!”

Ying Mingchao was immediately enraged upon hearing those words. He shot forth his palm, and Immortal-level martial power soon exploded in the direction of that mysterious blue-gowned individual.

“With how furious you are, your actions could be said to be pardonable. After all, if my woman were to run away with another man, I too would be furious.”

At that moment, the voice of that mysterious blue-gowned individual sounded again. When the energy ripples dispersed, Ying Mingchao revealed a surprised expression in his eyes.

That blue-gowned individual was still standing where he was. Furthermore, he was not injured in the slightest.

“Heeahh!!!”

Suddenly, Ying Mingchao soared into the sky. With his Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd in hand, he slashed at that mysterious blue-gowned individual.

“Woosh~~~”

As for that mysterious blue-gowned individual, he merely swept his hand across the space before him, and Ying Mingchao who was emitting overwhelming oppressive might, reacted as if he had been restricted, and fell directly from the sky. Ying Mingchao was actually unable to move in the slightest.

Although he was extremely powerful, Ying Mingchao was actually powerless to even contend against that mysterious blue-gowned man.

“This guy.”

At that moment, Chu Feng started to frown. As he had guessed, that mysterious blue-gowned man was extremely powerful.

He was so powerful that there was no one in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm that could contend against him. He must have been an expert from the Upper Realms.

For experts like him, they were beings akin to gods in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. They were truly individuals capable of moving the clouds and summoning the rain with a flip of their hands. After all, there was simply no one capable of contending against him there.

It was as if a fierce tiger had arrived within a group of sheep. That tiger could do whatever it wished to the sheep.

“Young man, it is fine to be furious. However, if you want to unleash your fury on someone, you must first find the right target. You should be glad that this senior of yours possesses a good temperament. Otherwise... you would already be dead,” That blue-gowned man said to Ying Mingchao.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng asked, “Why are you aiming to kill me?”

He knew very well that the target of that blue-gowned individual was not Ying Mingchao. Rather, it was him.

“You’re quite smart,” The blue-gowned individual cast his gaze onto Chu Feng. There was a trace of oppressiveness in his gaze.

“Let me ask you a question: is your father called Chu Xuanyuan?” The blue-gowned man asked.

“Chu Xuanyuan?”

Chu Feng’s heart tightened. Sure enough, that blue-gowned individual had come for him. Merely, Chu Feng did not expect that it was related to his father.

“He is not Chu Xuanyuan’s son. He merely has the same name as Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

Right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded. Then, a figure appeared before Chu Feng.

It was the Golden Crane True Immortal. The person that had suddenly appeared was the Golden Crane True Immortal.

“Oh, then I have made an error,” The blue-gowned individual said with a beaming smile. As he spoke, he also released Ying Mingchao.

“Didn’t you hear that Chu Xuanyuan’s son already died? Even if he is alive, he would not have a Heavenly Bloodline,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“Haha, of course I knew that. It’s nothing too serious, I merely dislike that name,” That blue-gowned individual said.

“You should leave this place. Otherwise... do not blame me if I am to inform your master about this,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“Golden Crane True Immortal, don’t you go around starting rumors and creating troubles. I have never once gone against the wishes of my lord,” That blue-gowned man said.

“Then what happened to him?” The Golden Crane True Immortal looked to Ying Mingchao who was still lying on the ground.

“He attacked me. I couldn’t possibly stand here and allow myself to be attacked, no? Moreover, have a look, have I injured him in the slightest?” Blue Gown argued.

“Leave the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm immediately. You are not allowed to create trouble for Chu Feng again. Otherwise... I will definitely not let you get away,” The Golden Crane True Immortal spoke seriously.

“Don’t worry, I’ll leave right now. This lousy place is not fun to be in, in the slightest. However, there’s quite a lot of trash here.”

As he said those words, that Blue Gown took a glance at Ying Mingchao.

“Hahaha...”

Then, he let out a laugh as he began to walk toward the distance.

Although he was merely walking, each footstep took him tens of thousands of meters. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared without a trace.

However, his laughter continued to echo. It was very mocking.

That said, it was true. Before him, Chu Feng and the others were akin to trash.
