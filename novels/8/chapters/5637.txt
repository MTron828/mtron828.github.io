Chapter 5637: Nine Heavens Secret Domain

“It could be because he was worried that he would offend us if he outdoes my unfilial daughter. It’s also possible that he gave up on challenging the record because he knows the limitations of his own strength. Regardless, the important thing is that child is going to join our ranks,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Eyy!” The mysterious elder sighed. “Our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was founded to bring experts from different realms together, but over time, we became a single entity. I have always thought that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is the highest standard for world spiritists, and everyone else aside from us is a nobody. It makes me uncomfortable to see such a talented outsider, even if he’s going to join our ranks.”

“It’s natural for you to feel this way,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said. “The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was founded to bring experts from different realms together, but we have never been through that generation ourselves, so we can't?relate to it. We have been in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion since our birth, so we naturally feel those inside are family members, whereas everyone else is an outsider.

“I think it’s right for us to maintain the superior bloodline of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Who would want to see their descendants progressively becoming weaker one generation after the other?”

“Indeed, Tianran. It’s good that you understand me.” The mysterious elder agreed with the words of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

“Milord, do you think what I’ve previously told you is feasible?’ the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“You have never believed in prophecy. Why the sudden change in mind?” the mysterious elder asked.

“Milord, I still have my reservations when it comes to prophecies, but I have to admit that something is different about God’s Era. This matter concerns the future of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. You would want to give it a try too if you have sensed that power in person, even if it comes at a price,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“You are the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master now. You can decide on your own, but know that you’ll have to bear the consequences of your decision,” the mysterious elder said as he took out a teleportation talisman with a flick of his wrist.

“I understand, milord. Thank you for your support,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Tianran, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion needs your leadership, especially at this critical time. We trust your capability. I believe that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion will reach new heights under your leadership. You may make the call if there are urgent decisions to be made. I’ll be leaving now. Contact me if you require my help,” the mysterious elder replied.

He crushed the teleportation talisman, and teleportation energy enveloped him.

“See you, milord.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master bowed until the mysterious elder disappeared. He dispelled the teleportation energy with a wave of his sleeves before turning his attention to the orb in the middle of the palace. Seven different colored fluids flowed inside the orb, but the black fluid was the most dominant one of all.

He had obtained this orb from God’s Era. Along with it came an instruction informing him that he needed to announce two important matters. One of them was news about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s entrance examination, and the other one depended on whether the orb filled up after the entrance examination began.

Now that the orb was filled up, he could finally announce the second important matter as soon as the trial was over. Based on the guidance he had received from God’s Era, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would enjoy glory like never before.

As for how true the prophecy was, he could only wait to find out.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master looked at the crystal ball with contemplative eyes as he murmured, “Chu Feng…”

In the end, his eyes hardened as he made a decision. He opened the palace door, where the experts of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were still kneeling.

“Where’s Zhenfu?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Milord, Elder Zhenfu is hosting the entrance examination,” someone replied.

“Call him to meet me in the palace,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master ordered before returning to the palace.

The order was relayed, and Elder Zhenfu quickly arrived. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master opened the palace door and gestured to Elder Zhenfu to enter. Elder Zhenfu walked into the palace and closed the door behind him.

The two of them were the only ones in the palace.

Elder Zhenfu looked at the orb in the center of the palace. He could sense something peculiar about the orb, but he couldn’t tell what its use was.

“How’s the examination going?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Lord Mansion Master, the examination is going well. There are more prodigious world spiritists in the world than I have expected,” Elder Zhenfu replied.

This matter was also beyond his expectation, and he wanted to share this joyous news with the mansion master. However, the latter wasn’t too concerned about it.

Instead, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said, “Change the location of the combat exam.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Lord Mansion Master, where should I change it to?”

Elder Zhenfu was surprised since the location and rules of the combat exam had been decided beforehand, and they had even constructed a huge formation for it. It was abrupt to change the location at this juncture.

“Bring them to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master ordered.

“Nine Heavens Secret Domain?” Elder Zhenfu was taken aback. “Lord Mansion Master, isn’t the goal of the entrance examination to pick prodigies to bring into our ranks?”

“Zhenfu, are you talking back to me right now?” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master narrowed his eyes.

“Lord Mansion Master, I dare not to. It’s just that there are many outstanding prodigies in the entrance examination. I believe that they’ll be an asset if we nurture them,” Elder Zhenfu said.

“Does our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion desperately require the help of outsiders?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“That’s not what I mean…” Elder Zhenfu wanted to clarify his words, but he found himself at a loss. In the end, he kneeled on the floor in a fluster and exclaimed, “I have misspoken. Lord Mansion Master, please punish me.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master burst into laughter.

“Calm down, Zhenfu. I know that you’re loyal to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Indeed, I ordered for the entrance examination to be held to find talents to bolster our rank, but don’t you think that only those who can survive the Nine Heavens Secret Domain are worthy of joining us? Even if they fail to survive, they should be honored to die in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain as world spiritists,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“You’re right, Lord Mansion Master,” Elder Zhenfu replied with a lowered head.

“Let the test begin then. Relay my orders. Those who cleared the trial must participate in the combat exam in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Forfeiture is not an option. Execute anyone who refuses,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

Elder Zhenfu’s complexion turned awful. He felt that it was a waste to send so many prodigies to their death, but this was an order from the mansion master. He could only reply, “Understood.”
