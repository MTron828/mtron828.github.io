Chapter 5938: Helping Song Yun Steal

“I heard that the new faction and the conservative faction will be holding an important meeting today. There’s a place where the new faction is currently based, and there will likely be gaps in their defenses when their upper echelons attend the meeting. I’ll give you a map and a way how you can sneak into their base. Help me steal something from there.”

Song Yun passed a map and a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng opened the map and saw a route and specific methods written on it. In the cosmos Sack were all kinds of formation-breaching treasures. Song Yun was well prepared.

She was entrusting this task to Chu Feng now, but the chances were that she would have done it herself anyway even if she didn’t meet him here.

“Little sister Song Yun is rowdy even in a place like the Netherworld Sect!” Chu Feng remarked.

“What are you saying, big brother Chu Feng? You’re making it sound as if I’m a terrible person. You don’t know how obedient I have been in the Netherworld Sect!” Song Yun pouted.

“Of course, of course. You do act obedient in front of me.” Chu Feng chuckled.

“Hey!” Song Yun looked at Chu Feng with a displeased pout, but it was soon replaced with a bright smile. “But big brother Chu Feng is right. It’s not just anyone who can make me obedient. They aren’t qualified.”

Chu Feng merely smiled in response before asking, “What’s the item you want? It’s not written on the map.”

“What I want is a red bottle with 38 talisman papers plastered on it. You should be able to find it once you get to this place,” Song Yun circled the map as she said.

“Are you that confident that I’d be able to take it?” Chu Feng could tell from the map that that place was special.

“Big brother Chu Feng, others might not be able to do it, but you’d be able to pull it off. You’re not only Jie Ranqing’s son but the most talented cultivator in the world of cultivation too,” Song Yun replied with a confident smile.

“I have a question. Is the Bluesnow Upper Realm the Netherworld Sect’s main base?”

“Of course not. I’m not sure where the Netherworld Sect’s main base is either. I haven’t climbed high enough to know that. This is only one of its branches.”

“Got it. I have another question.”

“What is it?”

“Do you still remember the little girl who was captured by the Netherworld Envoy who brought you to the Netherworld Sect?”

“I know her. She’s cute, albeit eerie.”

“Do you know where she is? Is she faring well?” Chu Feng asked. He thought that there was a good chance the little girl was the Darkness Monstrous God’s soul, as well as the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s sacred treasure.

“The little girl never got to the Netherworld Sect. Someone intercepted her,” Song Yun replied.

“Someone took her? Who?” Chu Feng asked.

“The Netherworld Envoy didn’t say. He just told me that he's a very powerful individual from the Nine Souls Galaxy.”

“A very powerful individual from the Nine Souls Galaxy?”

Chu Feng was confused as he didn’t think that there were any powerful people in the Nine Souls Galaxy, but he soon recalled a person—Xian Miaomiao’s master, Song Changsheng. He fit the criteria here.

But why would Song Changsheng kidnap the little girl? Did he notice something?

Of course, Chu Feng couldn’t confirm that Song Changsheng was behind it either, since the world of cultivation was filled with many unfathomable experts. There could be other experts in the Nine Souls Galaxy too.

“Big brother Chu Feng, there are so many people you’re worried about. I’m starting to think that you’re a playboy. Does big sister Zi Ling know about this?” Song Yun tilted her head and looked at Chu Feng with a mischievous smile.

“They are my friends,” Chu Feng replied.

“Sure, it’s a coincidence that they are all female friends. That little girl is very young. Don’t you think that it’s premature for you to be making a move on her?”

“What are you saying? I’m not even close with her. I’m just curious because she once lent me a helping hand.”

Chu Feng knew that he wouldn’t be able to convince Song Yun of the matter, so he decided to change the topic. “Little sister Song Yun, how long will it take for you to gather news regarding Xianhai Yu’er?”

“I should be able to find out by the time the meeting ends,” Song Yun replied.

“That’s good. I’ll obtain the red bottle for you. In exchange, I hope that you can gather as much information as possible. It’d be best if you could uncover where Xianhai Yu’er is imprisoned. But make sure to tread carefully. Your safety comes first.”

“Rest assured, big brother Chu Feng. I’m not a fool. I’ll be careful. Oh right! Big brother Chu Feng, do you still remember the Netherworld Embryo inside you?”

“I do.”

Chu Feng remembered it. The Netherworld Envoy told him he was guided to him by a Divine Vat, so he planted a Netherworld Embryo in him. However, his Netherworld Embryo had been in hibernation since, so it didn’t affect him in the least.

“Your Netherworld Embryo is still in your body, right?” Song Yun asked.

“That’s right.” Chu Feng nodded. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“That’s good. Take this.”

Song Yun passed a black talisman paper with red writings to Chu Feng. These writings looked like a sinister ghost infant.

“It’s an Embryo Awakening Talisman. It’ll allow you to awaken and tap into the Netherworld Embryo’s energy. You should be able to reach rank one True God level with this talisman’s power,” Song Yun said.

“How do I use it?” Chu Feng asked.

“You just have to paste it on your forehead. Your Netherworld Embryo will awaken and attempt to take over your body. You have to first keep it under control, then you’ll be able to utilize its powers.”

“It looks like you have been faring well in the Netherworld Sect. You were able to obtain such good stuff too.”

“This talisman is invaluable, but not everyone can use it. A lapse in control can cause a backlash from the Netherworld Embryo. In the worst-case scenario, one could die from one’s energy going berserk. It’s a dangerous tool, but it should be a walk in the park for big brother Chu Feng.”

“You have such a high opinion of me. Aren’t you afraid of me dying to it?”

“That’s impossible. There’s only one person in this world whom I acknowledge to be above me, and that’s my big brother Chu Feng! You’ll surely be able to control a mere Embryo Awakening Talisman.” Song Yun chuckled.

“You sure know how to flatter me.”

“As long as big brother Chu Feng likes it.” At this point, Song Yun suddenly halted her footsteps. “Big brother Chu Feng, let’s quickly get to action. Let’s meet here once we’re done.”

“All right.” Chu Feng nodded.

“See you, big brother Chu Feng.”

Song Yun turned around and walked away, but she would turn back every few steps to wave to him. Even so, her movements were so fast that it didn’t take long for her to disappear from sight.
