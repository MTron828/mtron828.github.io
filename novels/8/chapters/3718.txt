Chapter 3718 - Battle God’s Halberd

“It’s impossible for that friend of mine to be a kindred spirit with someone like you. You should give up on that thought,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said with an extremely certain tone.

His tone was also filled with contempt and disgust towards the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“You are truly someone who gauges the heart of a gentleman with your own vile heart. You are not that brother, how could you be so certain that he and I cannot become friends?” The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was unconvinced.

After hearing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words, Grandmaster Liangqiu revealed an angry look and shouted coldly, “Who are you calling vile?!”

Seeing that Grandmaster Liangqiu was angered, Chu Feng, worried that a fight would break out, hurriedly asked, “Senior, where is the Mirror Core? Since we’ve already come out, we should notify senior Zhu.”

“You want to enter the Mirror Core? Boy, you can forget about that.”

“You’re unable to even withstand the Gate of Death. How could you possibly enter the Mirror Core? Not even I am able to enter the Mirror Core,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said after hearing Chu Feng’s desire to enter the Mirror Core.

“Grandmaster Liangqiu, could it be that that place is very dangerous?” Chu Feng turned to ask Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“Indeed, it is a very dangerous place. However, Chu Feng, you don’t have to be too worried either. Brother Zhu’s ability far surpasses that of this old man.”

“Brother Zhu said to give him seventy-nine days. He said that he should be able to return on his own within seventy-nine days. Furthermore, he told us to not disturb him within these seventy-nine days,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“What if senior Zhu is unable to return on his own within seventy-nine days?” asked Chu Feng.

“If brother Zhu is unable to return on his own...” After saying those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu let out a look of difficulty. However, when he turned to Chu Feng and saw the determined look on his face; a look of not planning to drop the subject without him explaining things properly, he ultimately said, “If he’s unable to return in seventy-nine days, he must’ve encountered some sort of trouble.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“He also stated that if he doesn’t return within seventy-nine days, you should come and find him.”

“He said that if it was you, you might be able to save him,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“Save him? If it’s the Mirror Core, then it’ll simply not be saving him. Instead, it’ll be throwing away one’s life.”

“Chu Feng, you must not go. Even if you went there, you won’t be able to save him. You will only be throwing your life away,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words were naturally not pleasant to the ears.

However, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Gu Mingyuan only glared at him sharply, and did not refute him.

They actually felt the same way as he did. They both felt that Chu Feng would only be throwing his life away by going to the Mirror Core.

Thinking that old man Zhu was able to enter the Mirror Core to utilize the power of the formation core to weaken the power of the Gate of Death, his ability could very well be described as omnipotent in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

However, even someone like him was unable to absolutely return safely after entering the Mirror Core.

Thus, Chu Feng, with his cultivation, would really be throwing his life away should he decide to enter the Mirror Core.

Thus, even though both Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu felt very ashamed of themselves, they still did not wish for Chu Feng to attempt the risk of entering the Mirror Core if old man Zhu did not return after seventy-nine days.

“Senior, is the Mirror Core far from here?” asked Chu Feng.

“It’s not far. It’s only hidden in the depths of the Mirror Sea. If one wishes to go there, one will be able to reach it in a couple incense sticks’ worth of time,” explained Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“This junior understands,” Chu Feng had made his decision.

Regardless of how dangerous of a place that Mirror Core might be, if that old man Zhu did not return after seventy-nine days, Chu Feng would go and rescue him.

After all, that old man Zhu had only entered that dangerous place for the sake of saving him and Chu Xuanzhengfa.

Thus, Chu Feng naturally could not ignore him, for that would be ungrateful and unjust.

“Oh, that’s right. Grandmaster Liangqiu, could the change that happened to the Mirror Sea be related to senior Zhu?”

“Could it be because of something he did in the Mirror Core?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

The transformation to the Mirror Sea was very strange. Originally, Gu Mingyuan was worried that the change to the Mirror Sea would cause the situation to become even more dangerous for Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa.

Yet now, Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa had managed to come out safely. Thus, she was naturally no longer worried about them.

However, she was still interested in knowing exactly what had happened, as the Mirror Sea had been around for a very long time, and yet this was the first time such a change had occurred.

“You’ve reminded me of this. Perhaps this change is really because of brother Zhu. After all, in terms of understanding of the Mirror Sea, there’s no one that understands the Mirror Sea better than brother Zhu.”

“He was able to even change the power of the Gate of Death from the Mirror Core. It’s not impossible for him to change the sea’s surface,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“You all are mistaken about that. This change to the Mirror Sea is not something that anyone could accomplish. The only possible way for this change to occur is if the most important item in the Mirror Sea has been retrieved by someone,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He revealed a proud smile on his wretched face as he said those words.

Chu Feng knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was showing off.

“What are you implying?” Grandmaster Liangqiu and Gu Mingyuan asked at the same time.

Sure enough, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words had caught their attention.

Chu Feng noticed that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist became even more pleased with himself.

“How could you two not understand what I’m implying?”

“What else could the most important thing in the Mirror Sea be?”

“That would naturally be the legendary weapon, the Battle God’s Halberd,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“You’re implying that someone has managed to retrieve the Battle God’s Halberd?” asked Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“That’s right,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Impossible. Brother Zhu has observed the Mirror Sea for many years all for the sake of obtaining that Battle God’s Halberd.”

“However, after all these years, he still doesn’t know where the Battle God’s Halberd is located. Thus, how could anyone possibly retrieve it?”

Grandmaster Liangqiu firmly refused to believe the proposal of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“The Battle God’s Halberd is indeed not something that can be retrieved by an ordinary individual.”

“The person who retrieved the Battle God’s Halberd is most definitely not an ordinary individual.”

“Thus, you two can open your eyes wide and look carefully... at this.”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he streaked his palm across his Cosmos Sack.

In the next moment, a silvery light was released from his hand.

“Clamor~~~”

After that silvery light was emitted, the Mirror Sea that was originally surging with giant waves became completely tranquil again.

Furthermore, over ten thousand silhouettes appeared behind the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Those silhouettes all had malevolent appearances. They resembled evil spirits. As for their auras, they were extremely powerful. All of them were rank one Exalted.
