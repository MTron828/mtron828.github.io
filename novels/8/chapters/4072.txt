Chapter 4072 - Unexpected Aid

Seeing the person that appeared before the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, not only were the crowd shocked, but even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were shocked.

The reason for that was because this person was the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

But, the Chu Heavenly Clan clearly had no association with the Red-dress Holy Land.

Why would they come to their aid?

“Meddling in other people’s business?”

The Xuanming Family’s family head narrowed his brows and displayed his displeasure.

The Xuanming Family was known for their arrogance.

As such, while they’d heard the rumors regarding the Red-dress Holy Land, they had never bothered to learn the details of those events.

All they knew was that the All-heaven Starfield has had a change in leadership, and its new ruler was the Red-dress Holy Land.

However, according to the rumors he had heard, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster was only a rank three Utmost Exalted.

The reason why the Red-dress Holy Land was able to defeat the All-heaven Sect was because they were aided by an expert.

However, that expert was not someone from the Red-dress Holy Land.

Thus, he believed that the Red-dress Holy Land had merely taken advantage of the situation and picked up its overlord status.

As such, not only did the Xuanming Family’s family head not fear the Red-dress Holy Land, but he instead looked down on them.

He felt that even if the Red-dress Holy Land was stronger than the Chu Heavenly Clan, they would not be too much stronger.

“I am not meddling in other people’s business. It’s just that I am unable to put up with you bullying others so excessively,” said Han Xiu.

“What an inability to put up with bullying excessively. In this world, there are countless things that one cannot put up with.”

However... for some things, they are not things that you can involve yourself in just because you want to.”

“If you want to pretend to be a benevolent individual, you’ll have to pay the price to do so.”

“Bang~~~”

As the Xuanming Family’s family head spoke, he unleashed his oppressive might and shot it straight toward the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

At practically the same time, Han Xiu also unleashed her oppressive might.

In the blink of an eye, the two oppressive mights collided.

Although their oppressive might was formless, the collision of their oppressive mights caused even the surrounding space to distort.

As their oppressive mights wreaked havoc, heaven and earth started to fluctuate. Everyone present could sense how powerful they were.

“It would appear that you’re really planning to take me on?”

The Xuanming Family’s family head narrowed his brows. The displeasure on his face grew even more intense.

“You can give it a try.” The Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster was not afraid in the slightest.

With this, their oppressive might grew more and more powerful.

Even though they did not actually start fighting, their opposing oppressive mights became exceptionally violent.

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen and the people from the Xuanming Family were all being repressed by the oppressive might, and forced to retreat.

However, the Xuanming Family’s family head was gaining an advantage over Han Xiu.

As this collision of the oppressive mights continued, the calm on Han Xiu’s face disappeared. Merely this confrontation of the oppressive might was starting to force her to put forth a strenuous amount of effort.

Even the crowd were able to tell that the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster’s oppressive might was inferior to the Xuanming Family’s family head’s oppressive might.

This was still only a confrontation of oppressive mights. If they were to truly fight, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster would definitely not be a match for the Xuanming Family’s family head.

“Is this Red-dress Holy Land truly the power that defeated the All-heaven Sect?”

“Why would their headmaster not even be a match for the Xuanming Family’s family head?”

“Didn’t the All-heaven Sect teach the Xuanming Family a major lesson back then?”

Sensing the change to the oppressive mights, the crowd began to wag their tongues again.

“You’re still not backing out?”

“Seeing that you’re a woman, this old man did not directly attack you.”

“Are you insisting on making this old man publicly defeat you?” The Xuanming Family’s family head spoke.

He spoke as if he were being lenient toward the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster because she was of the fairer sex.

However, his words were not spoken through voice transmission. Instead, he spoke them out loud for everyone to hear.

This was not an act of modesty at all. He was clearly trying to show off how powerful he was.

Even though the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster didn’t say anything and looked unmoved, she was actually starting to panic.

She actually didn’t know much about the Chu Heavenly Clan.

When she had first heard about the Chu Heavenly Clan, it was from Yin Zhuanghong.

Yin Zhuanghong told her that a very powerful person of the younger generation by the name of Chu Feng had appeared in the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Chu Heavenly Clan.

But, the reason why Han Xiu was helping the Chu Heavenly Clan was not because of Yin Zhuanghong.

Instead, it was because of Zhao Hong.

Normally, the grand occasion this time around would be the optimal opportunity to reveal the strength of the Red-dress Holy Land. As such, Zhao Hong should’ve come.

However, it just so happened that she was about to enter closed-door training when they received the Purple Star Hall’s invitation.

As her closed-door training was very important and might end up affecting her future cultivation should she miss it, Zhao Hong had decided that she would enter closed-door training and have Han Xiu lead the people from the Red-dress Holy Land to participate in this grand occasion instead.

Before Zhao Hong entered closed-door training, she had mentioned one thing to Han Xiu in passing.

She told her to make sure to befriend the Chu Heavenly Clan, and not to have conflicts with them should she encounter them.

Apart from that, she didn’t say anything else.

As such, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster had no idea that Asura, the person who had helped them many times, was actually the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Feng.

She was purely coming to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s aid because Zhao Hong had told her to befriend them.

Because of Zhao Hong’s order, she realized that she must possess some sort of relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan.

She was merely helping the Chu Heavenly Clan because she was giving face to Zhao Hong.

However, she was feeling slightly regretful of her decision now.

She was able to sense that the Xuanming Family’s family head was indeed more powerful than her.

She was now riding atop a tiger and unable to get off.

As she had already stepped in, if she were to cower to him now, she would be ridiculed by others.

But, if they were to truly fight and she ended up being defeated, it would inevitably damage the reputation of the Red-dress Holy Land.

Han Xiu found herself stuck between a rock and a hard place. She had no idea what she should do.

“Xuan Tianpeng, oh how mighty you are.”

Right at this moment, a figure landed beside the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

When that figure landed, the Xuanming Family’s family head’s oppressive might was immediately suppressed.

Not only that, but he also found himself unable to stand firm, and was forced to move back repeatedly.

The reason for that was because an oppressive might even more powerful than his own had appeared before him.

It was a rank four Utmost Exalted’s oppressive might.

Upon looking closely, everyone recognized the identity of the person that appeared.

He was the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“You! You’re also planning to meddle in other people’s business?”

Seeing the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the Xuanming Family’s family head revealed an even uglier expression.

Not only that, but he also began to panic in his heart.

The Miao Heavenly Clan had always been stronger than his Xuanming Family. They were an existence that he was unwilling to provoke.

“My Miao Heavenly Clan has a friendly relationship with the Red-dress Holy Land. I’d like to ask you to give this old man face, and not make things difficult for the Red-dress Holy Land.”

“Else, even if this old man is to meddle in other people’s business, you would not be able to stop me,” the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said with a beaming smile. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You...”

Hearing those words, the Xuanming Family’s family head was so furious that he nearly vomited blood.

The front half of that Miao Heavenly Clan’s words were rather courteous.

However, his closing statement, that ‘you would not be able to stop me,’ was simply a slap in the face to his Xuanming Family.
