Chapter 2496 - Mental Attack

“If I didn’t witness it myself, I would not have believed that someone would truly be able to accomplish such a thing either,” The plain-clothed old monk exclaimed. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It would seem that I can announce the result then,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“Wait a moment first,” The plain-clothed old monk said.

“What’s the matter?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.

“Look at Chu Feng,” The plain-clothed old monk said.

Hearing that, the Golden Crane True Immortal turned his gaze toward Chu Feng.

“That is?”

At that moment, the Golden Crane True Immortal also revealed a surprised expression.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s palm trembled once again. Then, a strand of light flowed out of his palm.

After that strand of light emerged, it started to condense together and change shape. In the end, it took the form of the Profound Light Pillar.

Although this Profound Light Pillar was only a centimeter long, it was indeed the Profound Light Pillar.

After Chu Feng completely refined the Profound Light Pillar, he actually reformed it.

Young Master Li Ming frowned. With a malicious tone, he asked, “What is the meaning of this?”

“Don’t think that I am deliberately yielding to you. I merely want to respect my opponent.”

“Your cultivation is stronger than mine. For the sake of being absolutely fair, the Golden Crane True Immortal set up this formation for us to compete in.”

“Since this match must be conducted fairly, I will naturally comply with this decision,” Chu Feng said.

“What grand aspiration,” The plain-clothed old monk exclaimed.

“Indeed. He had clearly already won. Yet, he still insists on competing with Li Ming. This sort of decision is not something that an average person would make.”

“After all, his opponent is Li Ming. Even if Chu Feng’s potential surpasses Li Ming’s, if they are to compete under equal terms, the outcome of the battle will still be undetermined,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“Won’t this be even better? We will be able to enjoy another great show,” The plain-clothed old monk said.

“Indeed. Chu Feng has truly given us quite a few pleasant surprises today,” The Golden Crane True Immortal smiled profoundly.

After all, not only had Chu Feng astonished them with his potential, but he had also brightened their eyes with his aspirations.

“Merely, with how proud and arrogant that Li Ming is, will he really accept Chu Feng yielding to him like this?” The plain-clothed old monk asked.

“Li Ming is indeed proud and arrogant. However, he came here mainly to request my help. This means that what he needs from me is very important to him.”

“Thus, he will accept it,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“This is your decision. Thus, don’t you be unwilling to accept defeat if you are to lose,” Young Master Li Ming said to Chu Feng.

Sure enough, even though Li Ming knew that Chu Feng was deliberately yielding to him, even though he felt a bit displeased because of it, he still chose to continue the match with Chu Feng.

“Rest assured. I, Chu Feng, am always one to accept my losses. However, the precondition for that is that you are able to defeat me,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“I will definitely let your desire come true.”

“Woosh~~~”

After Young Master Li Ming said those words, his body suddenly moved. Like an arrow leaving the bow, his speed surpassed that of lightning. With enormous power, he rushed toward Chu Feng.

That’s right. He was aiming for Chu Feng, and not the Profound Light Pillar behind Chu Feng.

His strategy was very simple. He planned to defeat Chu Feng and then capture the Profound Light Pillar.

“Woosh~~~”

At practically the same time Young Master Li Ming rushed toward Chu Feng, Chu Feng’s body also shifted. He turned into a perfectly straight ray of golden light and flew toward Young Master Li Ming.

“Watch my attack!!!”

In the blink of an eye, the two of them reached one another. Like a torrential rain, Young Master Li Ming started to shoot rapid fists toward Chu Feng.

He was not planning to attack only a single point on Chu Feng. Rather, he was planning to attack Chu Feng’s entire body. He was planning to knock Chu Feng down openly.

“Humph.”

However, faced with Young Master Li Ming’s attack, Chu Feng merely snorted. Then, his ten fingers spread open, and he pushed his arms forward.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

The next moment, like a copper wall, an iron bastion, an impenetrable defense, countless palms appeared before Chu Feng.

All of Young Master Li Ming’s fists were blocked by Chu Feng’s palms.

Then, Chu Feng unleashed a series of counterattacks toward Young Master Li Ming. However, his attacks were also all blocked by Young Master Li Ming.

At that moment, the two of them possessed the same battle power. As for their attacks and techniques, they were also equally matched.

In a back and forth manner, although their confrontation was exceptionally intense, they entered a stalemate right away.

“Those two brats’ fighting techniques are both really skillful. However, precisely because of that, it is hard to determine the outcome of the match. If they are to continue like this, it is very difficult for either one of them to effectively defeat the other. They must quickly turn their targets to the Profound Light Pillars,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“That might not necessarily be the case,” The plain-clothed old monk said.

“Could it be that what I said was wrong?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.

“Oh Golden Crane, this is, after all, a formation that you’ve set up. How could you not know that the power of the Profound Light Pillars will eventually be completely exhausted?”

“Although their battle powers are equal right now, once they start to exhaust the powers they obtained from the Profound Light Pillars, an outcome to this battle will be determined,” The plain-clothed old monk said.

“I understand what you mean. Once they exhaust the powers they obtained, Li Ming can only resign himself to fate. After all, he simply does not possess enough potential to refine the final bits of the Profound Light Pillar.”

“However, Chu Feng is capable of doing that. He is capable of doing what Li Ming cannot,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“No, you still do not understand Chu Feng. Since he decided to not completely refine the Profound Light Pillar from the very beginning, and chose to confront Li Ming with identical strength, that means that even if all of the power he obtained from the Profound Light Pillar is exhausted, he will not choose to refine the remainder of the Profound Light Pillar’s power,” The plain-clothed old monk said.

“Then, how are they to determine victory and defeat?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.

“Although they possess the same amount of energy in their bodies, it does not mean that they will exhaust them at the same rate,” The plain-clothed old monk said.

“I understand what you mean by that. However, Old Demonic Substance, I can tell you with certainty that what you are thinking of is impossible to accomplish.”

“It is very difficult for one to control the power one has obtained from the Profound Light Pillar. Thus, they will be consuming it at a practically identical speed,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said determinedly.

“While it might be true that ordinary individuals will not be able to be able to control the power they obtain from the Profound Light Pillars, do not forget that these two brats are not ordinary individuals.”

“Don’t forget that it was originally impossible for one to completely refine the Profound Light Pillar,” The plain-clothed old monk said with a beaming smile.

“Are you suggesting that Chu Feng will be able to bring about another miracle?” Hearing what the plain-clothed old monk said, the Golden Crane True Immortal cast his gaze toward Chu Feng once again.

“It might not necessarily be Chu Feng. Perhaps it is Li Ming who will accomplish that,” As the plain-clothed old monk spoke, he cast his gaze to Young Master Li Ming.

At that moment, Chu Feng and Young Master Li Ming were still fighting one another. Young Master Li Ming was unleashing a rapid offense at Chu Feng.

“Li Ming, have you not eaten anything? Why are your fists growing weaker and weaker?” With a sneer, Chu Feng mocked Young Master Li Ming.

Li Ming did not answer Chu Feng’s mocking words. Furthermore, he did not reveal any expression. However, his attacks grew faster and faster, and more and more powerful.

“It’s actually a mental attack. This brat Chu Feng truly has some tricks up his sleeve,” The plain-clothed old monk said with a beaming smile.

“Chu Feng is actually this shrewd and ruthless at such a young age. Compared to him, Li Ming is truly somewhat soft and immature,” The Golden Crane True Immortal gasped with admiration.

Although Young Master Li Ming appeared to be unaffected on the surface, his attacks grew more and more explosive.

Perhaps neither Chu Feng nor Young Master Li Ming were capable of controlling the speed at which they consumed their energy.

However, if one were to frantically attack like Young Master Li Ming, they would definitely increase the speed at which they consumed their energy.

Thus, at that moment, the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk, these two old monsters, had already determined that Li Ming was affected by Chu Feng’s mental attack.

The reason for that was because the energy he was consuming had already surpassed that of Chu Feng.

If it were to continue, he would be the first one to consume all of the energy in his body. Once he consumed all of his energy, he would no longer be able to contend against Chu Feng.
