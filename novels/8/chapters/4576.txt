Chapter 4576: The Conclusion of the Tournament

What was the most important of all was that the black-robed man actually halted right after he heard that voice.

However, there was still a lingering smile on his lips, as if he hadn’t gotten enough of the fight yet.

Seeing this, Chu Feng raised the Immemorial Hero’s Sword once more as he prepared himself to make a move. While he had managed to inflict wounds all over the black-robed man’s body, he had no intention of letting the latter off so easily.

“Young friend, let it go.”

However, the elder’s voice sounded once more.

It was a deep and majestic voice. Even though it carried no oppressive might, the power behind the voice was more than enough to indicate that the elder was someone of great prowess.

Chu Feng’s instincts told him that the elder’s strength could very well be even higher than that of Shengguang Xuanye’s. Furthermore, it would appear that the elder had some kind of ties with the black-robed man.

Shortly after the elder spoke up, the space behind the black-robed man suddenly began to warp. A spirit formation gate appeared behind him.

“Chu Feng, I’ll remember you. Know that I have not lost today because I didn’t use my full strength. We shall meet again in the future. I know that a place like the Holy Light Galaxy can’t possibly house you. We shall have an exciting fight the next time we meet!”

The black-robed man said as he turned around and stepped into the spirit formation gate.

As soon as the black-robed man stepped in, the spirit formation gate immediately vanished from sight.

At the same time, the elder’s voice also vanished as well.

This sight left everyone present feeling a little chilled.

They could also tell that the elder who had just spoken had some ties with the black-robed man. The Storm Combat Dragon Ring was a place where even the Holy Light Clan had to use a treasure in order to send their juniors in, but that black-robed man and the elder were actually able to come and go as they pleased!

Just what kind of background did they come from?

But no matter what, it was certain that they were formidable existences. It was likely that there was no one in the current Holy Light Galaxy who could deal with them.

The black-robed man had hurled out such awful insults about the Holy Light Galaxy, but the Holy Light Clan was unable to do anything about him as the other party walked away right under their eyelids.

This made everyone present feeling uncomfortable on the inside.

One must know that they were all distinguished figures in the Holy Light Galaxy, but compared to the larger world of cultivators out there, they were no different from powerless ants.

The only reason why they had survived thus far was because the stronger existences either forgot about this place or were unwilling to set foot here.

It was fortunate that was the case, or else it would have ended in a calamity for the Holy Light Galaxy.

Take the black-robed man and the mysterious elder from earlier for example. Had the mysterious elder decided to massacre all of them, was there anyone present who had the strength to stop them?

Probably not even the strongest expert of the Holy Light Clan, Shengguang Xuanye, would dare claim that he had the capability to defeat that mysterious elder!

While everyone was still feeling a little conflicted about this entire matter, Chu Feng had already descended to the bottom of the mountain to treat Long Xiaoxiao.

The other juniors were completely helpless before Long Xiaoxiao’s injuries, but under Chu Feng’s treatment, her condition began to improve.

As it turned out, on top of his superior fighting prowess, Chu Feng was also a skilled world spiritist too.

The juniors all around directed looks of admiration and respect toward Chu Feng. There were even some who viewed him in reverence.

One must know that all of those still surviving here were top prodigies who were renowned back at where they lived.

“It’s fortunate that young friend Chu Feng was here today, or else our Holy Light Galaxy would have been placed in an awkward position.”

“Where did young friend Chu Feng come from? Did he really come from a minor Chu Heavenly Clan?”

“That can’t be so. Putting aside the fact that he could use an Exalted Armament, just the fact that he is in possession of one already shows that he’s from a major power!”

The crowd looked at Chu Feng once more in a mixture of curiosity and wonderment.

In the past, they would have never thought that the dignity of the Holy Light Galaxy would have been upheld by a junior.

However, Chu Feng had no interest in the praises that the others had to offer him. At this very moment, the only thing that was in his eyes was Long Xiaoxiao’s injuries.

He was giving his all in order to treat her so as to lessen her suffering.

It was just that her injuries were far too severe. Despite his greatest effort, he was only able to close up her wounds. However, the recovery of her soul wasn’t making much progress.

“This feeling?”

All of a sudden, Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed in astonishment.

He sensed powerful energy surging from within Long Xiaoxiao’s body. With incredible speed, it healed the injuries which even Chu Feng had trouble dealing with.

Due to this, Long Xiaoxiao’s pale face swiftly regained its redness.

“Waa, Lord Chu Feng sure is incredible! He was able to heal Princess Xiaoxiao’s injuries so easily even though we weren’t able to do anything about it earlier!”

The juniors heaped yet another wave of compliments on Chu Feng upon seeing this.

However, Chu Feng knew deep well that this wasn’t his doing. Rather, it was Long Xiaoxiao’s own regenerative capability.

One must know that Long Xiaoxiao was no ordinary junior anymore. She was someone who had fused together with the Dragon Vein Source!

“Xiaoxiao, how are you feeling?”

Chu Feng looked at Long Xiaoxiao worriedly as he asked.

However, it would seem like his question was unfounded. The lass had a reddened face, and her eyes looked a little entranced.

Rather than a patient, she looked more like someone who was lovestruck.

Weng!

It was then that a loud buzzing sound echoed from above.

Looking upward, the juniors saw that the sky above them was being torn apart, revealing a larger world out there. In this larger world, there were many familiar faces.

The Storm Combat Dragon Ring was finally being deactivated.

With this, the tournament had come to an end.
