Chapter 3381 - The Remnants An Eccentric

The reason why the World Spiritist Immortal King was so well-known was because he left a grand formation behind on the Ice Summit.

Furthermore, he had also left a treasure.

Should one be able to breach his grand formation, one would be able to obtain his treasure.

The treasure he left behind was a World Spiritist Saint Cloak. The World Spiritist Saint Cloak was created using the Nine Dragon Aura hidden deep within the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. Because of that, it was known as the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

The reason why people knew about it was because there was a stele located outside the Ice Summit’s spirit formation. The contents of the stele were engraved by none other than the World Spiritist Immortal King.

The stele detailed the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak to have been created according to the Nine Dragons Upper Realm’s Nine Dragons Aura.

Because that World Spiritist Saint Cloak was made with Nine Dragons Aura, the World Spiritist Immortal King decided to leave it to the people of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

However, he did not wish to hand the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak to some nobody. Because of that, he set up a spirit formation.

Only someone who could breach the spirit formation would be able to obtain the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

However,up till now, there had never been a single person who could breach that spirit formation.

“Senior, not even Grandmaster Liangqiu was able to breach the formation on the Ice Summit?” Chu Feng asked.

“No,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head.

“In that case, it would appear that that grand formation is truly difficult to breach,” Chu Feng exclaimed.

“Indeed. Because of how difficult it is, the Ice Summit is deemed to be one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Three Great Eccentrics’ Remnants,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Three Great Eccentrics’ Remnants?” Chu Feng revealed a curious expression.

“Oh, I’d nearly forgotten that young friend Chu Feng has just returned recently, and does not know the matters of the Ancestral Martial Starfield well,” after the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he began to tell Chu Feng about the so-called Three Great Eccentric’s Remnants.

They were respectively...

From the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, the Ice Summit’s Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

From the Sealcalm Upper Realm, the Netherseal Cave’s Netherworld Chariot.

From the Lonesome Upper Realm, the Mirror Sea’s Battle God Halberd.

There were several common aspects to the three locations.

The three places all held treasures left behind by experts.

The experts that left the treasures at the three places were all very mysterious. No one knew where they came from, or where they went.

The treasures left behind by the experts were all of considerable value. Yet, no one had managed to retrieve them.

Because of that, the three places were known as the Three Great Eccentrics’ Remnants.

“Actually, there were originally Five Great Eccentrics’ Remnants in the Ancestral Martial Starfield in the past. However, the treasures from two of the remnants have already been retrieved.”

“Oh, that’s right. The two people that retrieved those two remnants were your father and grandfather,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said with a quiet voice.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from growing excited.

Hearing the descriptions provided by the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he knew how difficult it was to retrieve the treasures from the Eccentrics’ Remnants.

If they were so easily retrieved, how could the Starfield Master Realm not retrieve them? How could the Linghu Heavenly Clan leave them alone?

For his father and grandfather to be able to retrieve the treasures from the Eccentrics’ Remnants, it was not as simple as merely retrieving treasures. What they’d accomplished was also a sort of honor, a sort of glory.

Because of what they’d done, Chu Feng felt incomparably proud.

“However, even your father and grandfather could do nothing about the three remaining remnants,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief added.

“Are those three remaining remnants that difficult?” Chu Feng was surprised.

In Chu Feng’s heart, his father and grandfather were very powerful existences. It would not even be excessive to say that they were omnipotent.

Yet, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said that both his father and grandfather were unable to deal with the remaining Three Great Eccentrics’ Remnants. It was only natural that Chu Feng would be astonished.

“There’s no need to question how talented in terms of martial cultivation your father and grandfather were. I have never seen anyone that was as much of a demon-level genius as that father and son.”

“However, in terms of world spirit techniques, they weren’t very powerful. At the very least, they were not very powerful back then. Because of that, neither of them had challenged the Ice Summit’s spirit formation.”

“As for the Sealcalm Upper Realm’s Netherseal Cave, it has been sealed the entire time. No one has been able to unseal it. In recent years, no one have even been there, much less challenged it.”

“As for that Lonesome Upper Realm’s Mirror Sea, your father and grandfather both failed in challenging it. The Mirror Sea was truly too difficult. Upon entering, one would either be killed or seriously injured. It was already exceptional that your father and grandfather were able to come out completely uninjured.”

“The two of them were also the only people that managed to enter the Mirror Sea and return completely unscathed.”

“The Mirror Sea is simply too dangerous. Although the Netherseal Cave has been sealed the entire time and no one knows what the inside of the cave is like, the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield still consider the Mirror Sea to be the strongest of the Three Great Eccentrics’ Remnants.”

“The Mirror Sea is publicly accepted to be the most difficult remnant to challenge.”

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief informed Chu Feng about the Three Great Eccentrics’ Remnants.

“It would appear that the Mirror Sea is quite interesting.”

Chu Feng decided that he would definitely go and check out the Mirror Sea’s formation that not even his father and grandfather were able to breach.

“As the Mirror Sea is extremely dangerous, and the Netherseal Cave is still sealed, the Ice Summit is, logically, the only place that one can challenge.”

“However, the Ice Summit has long been controlled by the Tantai Heavenly Clan. It’s not a place that one can challenge just because one wants to.”

“Those who decide to trespass onto the Ice Summit without permission will be severely punished.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Because of that, the Tantai Heavenly Clan even deliberately utilized a spirit formation left behind by that World Spiritist Immortal King as a prison to imprison the trespassers and deter others.”

“As such, generally no one would go to the Ice Summit. At the very most, they would only look at it from afar. Simply no one dared to approach it.”

“Had it not been for the fact that the four Saint-cloak World Spiritists were present, even if the crowd had gathered here, they would not be able to ascend onto the Ice Summit and would, at the very most, only observe it from afar,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“There’s actually such a thing? It would appear that the Tantai Heavenly Clan is planning to hog the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak left behind by that World Spiritist Immortal King,” Chu Feng said.

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sighed. “Actually, they’re only deterring those weak individuals. If the people from the Starfield Master Realm or the Linghu Heavenly Clan were to come challenge it, how could the Tantai Heavenly Clan possibly dare to stop them?”

“Look, isn’t the Tantai Heavenly Clan allowing people to enter the Ice Summit after the four Saint-cloak World Spiritists announced that those within a hundred years of age could enter?”

“That’s true,” Chu Feng nodded.

The world of martial cultivators was a world where the weak were prey to the strong. For many powers, they would act akin to gods, and could not be blasphemed before weaklings. However, before people and powers stronger than them, they would act extremely petty, low and akin to cowards.

Chu Feng had witnessed a great many of such occurrences, and had already gotten used to it.

......

At that moment, a lot of people were gathered at the foot of the Ice Summit. Under the supervision of the Tantai Heavenly Clan, no one was allowed to fly. Thus, if one wanted to ascend onto the Ice Summit, one would have to do so by climbing the mountain path.

Because of that, the path toward Ice Summit was already packed with people.

Although Chu Feng possessed a title plate, he did not wish to be one who refused to abide by the rules. As such, he followed the crowd and lined up to climb the mountain.

That said, although Chu Feng had decided to abide by the rules, not everyone did.

A group of people walked upward aggressively. They simply did not plan to line up to climb the mountain. Instead, they were pushing the people that were ahead of them aside.

Chu Feng noticed that they had the title plate of the Xu Heavenly Clan on their waists.

Hearing the conversations of the crowd, Chu Feng learned why those people were so arrogant.

It turned out that the Xu Heavenly Clan was also a power of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

Although they were also a Heavenly Clan, they had already pledged allegiance to the Tantai Heavenly Clan, and become one of their subsidiary powers. Furthermore, they had a very good relationship with the Tantai Heavenly Clan. As such, they could be said to be equal to being subordinates of the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

While it might be different in other places, very few people would dare to offend the Xu Heavenly Clan in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

Thus, even for some powerful individuals, they would choose to endure the arrogance, rudeness and aggressiveness of the Xu Heavenly Clan.

In fact, many people would hurriedly move aside upon discovering that it was the Xu Heavenly Clansmen, opening up a path for them.

They were not acting like that because they were really afraid of the Xu Heavenly Clan. Instead, they were afraid of the Tantai Heavenly Clan that stood behind the Xu Heavenly Clan.

In the blink of an eye, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen had arrived before Chu Feng and the others.

They had already caused a commotion by the time they arrived there. Practically everyone would move aside for them. However, when they arrived before Chu Feng and the others, Chu Feng actually had no plans to voluntarily move aside for them. This displeased the Xu Heavenly Clansmen. They pointed at Chu Feng and shouted, “Kid up front, move aside immediately! Do not block your daddy’s path!”

They had thought that Chu Feng would immediately step aside upon hearing their shouts.

However, to their surprise, not only did Chu Feng not step aside, but he instead refuted disapprovingly, “Why should I move aside?”
