Chapter 5388: Feeling of Intimacy

Before Chu Feng could even get close to the golden light pillar, he noticed shockwaves rippling from its vicinity. A fight was ongoing!

He got a little closer and saw that the woman had arrived before him, but she, too, was unable to approach the golden light pillar. Eight gigantic red beasts were attacking her. They were all at rank one Heavenly Realm, the same level as Chu Feng and the woman.

To make things worse, the woman wouldn’t be able to deploy her usual means due to the restrictions of the formation.

As a result, she wasn’t able to match the eight gigantic red beasts and swiftly fell into a disadvantageous position.

“At this rate, she’ll be defeated even if I don’t make a move. But if the ones to defeat her are the gigantic red beasts instead of me, will this still be considered my victory?”

Chu Feng recalled the earlier rules and wondered if he had to personally defeat the woman.

“My apologies, but I have no choice since that’s what the rules ask for.”

Chu Feng lifted his arm and manifested a bow out of his martial power. It was a martial skill he had obtained from one of the blue bundles of light. It was not a particularly strong martial skill, but it was still stronger than his Bow of Hundred Transformations.

He was in an absolutely advantageous position here. That woman was too busy dealing with the eight red gigantic beasts to notice him. With his skills, he was confident that his arrow would be able to take her down.

Yet, instead of releasing his arrow, his eyes were drawn to the eight red gigantic beasts.

“What’s wrong, Chu Feng?” Eggy asked.

“Eggy, I think that something is amiss,” Chu Feng said.

“What’s amiss?”

“Take a closer look. Don’t you think that the auras coming from the eight red gigantic beasts resemble runes?” Chu Feng asked. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Do they?” Eggy asked.

There was indeed an aura flowing on each of the red gigantic beasts, but she didn’t think that they looked like runes.

“Let me take a closer look.”

As a skilled world spiritist, Chu Feng had a sharp eye for runes even without relying on his Heaven’s Eye. While the red auras were constantly changing and didn’t appear like runes at first glance, his intuition told him that they were indeed runes.

The more difficult it was to see through something, the greater the secret hidden beneath it.

Chu Feng carefully observed the red auras and soon noticed a pattern.

While the constantly changing red auras looked to be moving completely randomly, they would occasionally morph into the shape of runes.

Chu Feng remembered all of the runes and quickly pieced them together to form a complete picture. That enlightened him to the secret hidden here.

“They are indeed runes! I knew that something was amiss, and I was right!” Chu Feng was overjoyed.

“Are they really runes? Are you able to decipher their secret?” Eggy asked.

“Eggy, I know what I have to do now. We can clear this place now.”

Chu Feng finally released the arrow, but it flew not toward the woman but the strongest red gigantic beast. The red gigantic beast was too busy fighting to notice Chu Feng’s presence, which resulted in its vitals getting struck.

With a cry of agony, it collapsed onto the floor and dissipated into the surroundings as a red aura.

This abrupt sight startled the woman.

She had been so focused on the fight that she didn’t notice the arrow at all. The sudden death of the red gigantic beast baffled her.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Another three more golden arrows flew forth and struck three red gigantic beasts. However, these beasts were much more guarded against the assassination after having witnessed the death of their brethren, which allowed them to avoid getting hit in their vitals.

“That is… the formation? Why is it helping me?”

The woman finally realized that Chu Feng was the one who had shot down the red gigantic beast, but that only confused her. After all, the earlier instruction had told her to compete with the formation, so it made no sense to her why the formation was helping her right now.

Grar!

Some of the red gigantic beasts charged at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng fearlessly stood his ground. Even though the two of them were at rank one Heaven Realm and had similar fighting prowess, his keen combat sense gave him a decisive edge over his opponent. He was able to single-handedly suppress three red gigantic beasts.

“As expected of the formation!”

The woman could tell that Chu Feng was stronger than her, but she wasn’t surprised in the least. After all, the strength of a formation could be easily altered by the creator. There was nothing much to be surprised about.

Chu Feng could have easily defeated all eight of the red gigantic beasts all alone, not to mention that he had the help of the woman. It didn’t take them long to clear the enemies.

Once they had defeated all of the red gigantic beasts, the golden light pillar suddenly shattered to release a flood of frost. A woman manifested out of the frost.

Even though her facial features were blurred, Chu Feng could tell that it was the same frost woman he had met in the Hidden Land.

“Congratulations on clearing this trial,” the frost woman said. She glanced at Chu Feng and added, “Especially you. You didn’t disappoint.”

With a wave of her hand, two scrolls fell into the hands of Chu Feng and the other woman.

“You’ll need these. Leave.”

Two surges of spirit power enveloped Chu Feng and that woman, and the light shrouding their bodies started to scatter. Slowly, their cultivation began to recover.

“You aren’t a formation?” The woman finally realized that Chu Feng wasn’t a formation.

“Elder, it was a pleasure working with you,” Chu Feng said with a bow.

Just then, the light around Chu Feng finally fully scattered, revealing his original appearance.

“You!!!”

The woman was startled to see Chu Feng’s face, but the latter vanished the following second.

Chu Feng was transported back to his accommodation, though he remained a little dazed.

“Chu Feng, what’s that scroll? Chu Feng? Chu Feng! What’s wrong?” Eggy realized that Chu Feng was a little out of it.

“Ah, it’s nothing.” Chu Feng snapped out of his daze.

“It’s not nothing. What happened?” Eggy asked worriedly.

“It really isn’t anything much. I just found the elder whom I met earlier a little familiar even though I have never seen her before,” Chu Feng said.

He managed to catch a glimpse of that woman’s appearance when the light around her finally scattered. She was a dignified old woman with an extraordinary disposition. But what really caught Chu Feng’s attention was the indescribable feeling of intimacy he felt from her.

Meanwhile, an old woman also reappeared in a wooden hut.

She immediately tossed aside the scroll she had received from the frost woman and took out a piece of paper, on which she drew a portrait of Chu Feng with her spirit power.

Not only was this old woman a True Dragon World Spiritist, but she was also residing in a location not too far away from where Chu Feng was.
