Chapter 3731 - The Furious Liangqiu

“Since you’re already here, you shouldn’t be leaving.”

Chu Feng felt furious upon thinking that the chaotic state of mind that he was in earlier was caused by those things.

Thus, he began to use his ability to refine those insect-like things; that strange power that had filled his body.

At the beginning, Chu Feng had no idea what sort of power those things possessed.

He merely complied with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s suggestion and decided to refine them because he had told him to.

However, upon refining the insects, Chu Feng felt completely shocked.

After refining the bugs, not only was Chu Feng’s body filled with boundless spirit power, but a great amount of information was also rushing into Chu Feng’s brain.

In fact, he was even able to gain some comprehension from them.

He gained... the comprehension to increase his spirit power and link to Snake Mark Saint-cloak Spirit Power.

Unfortunately, the amount of insects were not sufficient. Before Chu Feng could gain more comprehension, the insects were all refined.

Chu Feng felt that if there were more of such strange powers, he might be able to make a breakthrough to Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

Noticing that Chu Feng had already refined the power, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist removed his palm from Chu Feng’s forehead.

“Didn’t I tell you the Mirror Core is a very dangerous place, that you should not go down there?” The Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng noticed that only him and Ox-nosed Old Daoist were outside the Mirror Core, and Grandmaster Liangqiu was nowhere to be seen.

Likely, Grandmaster Liangqiu had returned to the surface because he was unable to withstand the pressure from that place.

That said, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s whereabouts were not important. What Chu Feng was concerned about was what the strange parasite-like powers that had entered his body unknowingly were.

“Senior, that power in my body was extremely strange. Exactly what is it?” Chu Feng asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“That is the power of the Mirror Core, a power that can make world spiritists stronger. However, the current you is still unable to withstand that sort of power.”

“If I didn’t help you, you would’ve been devoured by that power, either turning into a puppet or dying from self-detonation,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“But, wasn’t that Mirror Core only the formation core of the Mirror Sea?”

“Why would there be such a strange power there?” asked Chu Feng.

“Formation core? Don’t listen to Liangqiu’s nonsense, the Mirror Core is much more complicated than you imagine it to be,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“In that case, exactly what sort of place is the Mirror Core?” asked Chu Feng.

“It’s meaningless for me to explain things to you right now. Thus, don’t ask about it anymore,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Senior, that senior Zhu...”

“Could it be that he has already been eroded by that power?”

Having experienced it himself, Chu Feng knew how terrifying the Mirror Core was.

Because of that, Chu Feng became even more worried about old man Zhu.

“Rest assured, he is alive and kicking. It’s impossible for him to be dead,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“He didn’t die? Senior, how do you know that?” asked Chu Feng.

“You don’t have to know how I know that, you should instead concern yourself with your own business. Do you now believe that you are unable to save him with your strength?”

“Earlier, if it wasn’t for this old man rescuing you, you would’ve died already,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“I...” Chu Feng felt very pained.

He truly wanted to go and save old man Zhu. However, he knew that he was also truly powerless to do anything.

It was as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had said, if it wasn’t for him rescuing Chu Feng earlier, he would’ve died there.

However, Chu Feng was only at the outermost region of the Mirror Core. He was still very far from reaching the depths.

When he could not even contend against the power at the outermost region, how exactly was he supposed to rescue old man Zhu?

“Don’t blame yourself. Follow me out first.”

“Should you be willing to go out with me, this old man will immediately bring you out,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said all of a sudden.

“But, senior, you...”

Chu Feng noticed that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s condition was not very good either.

This was not merely caused by him coming to Chu Feng’s aid. This revealed that the Mirror Core’s power was also capable of affecting the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t wish for Chu Feng to take risks. Naturally, Chu Feng also did not wish for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to risk his life for him.

“Enough with the buts. You’ll understand once we go out.”

After he finished saying those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist grabbed Chu Feng’s shoulder and shot straight for the sea’s surface.

“Clamor~~~”

Water splashed into the sky. Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had returned to the surface.

Sure enough, Grandmaster Liangqiu was waiting there.

“Chu Feng, are you alright?”

Seeing Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu hurriedly rushed forth.

“Alright? Ask him yourself. If it wasn’t for me going down there to save him, he would’ve died,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Grandmaster Liangqiu was naturally able to tell that Chu Feng’s health was extremely weak right now.

He was feeling very pained to see Chu Feng like that. Now, after hearing what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said, he felt even more pained.

If he hadn’t informed Chu Feng of that seventy-nine day appointment, he wouldn’t have taken such risks.

“Senior, I am truly sorry. This junior was unable to save senior Zhu,” Chu Feng had an ashamed look on his face.

“Enough with the senior Zhu, that person simply wanted to kill you.”

“It’s my first time encountering someone like that. It’s one thing to kill oneself, but he actually wanted to drag others down with him. That person simply does not possess the demeanor of a senior in the slightest," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke with an extremely mocking tone.

“Senior, please don’t say it like that. After all, senior Zhu only entered the Mirror Core in order to save me,” said Chu Feng.

“Save you? Pah! The person who saved you is this old man. If it wasn’t for this old man, you and that Chu Xuanzhengfa would simply not have been able to escape from the Gate of Death. He is nothing more than a swindler.” The Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not exercise any restraint. Instead, his attitude turned even more vile.

“Ox-nose, you simply do not know what brother Zhu has done. Thus, you’d best be more respectful when speaking of him.” At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu, who was already in a bad mood, revealed a look of anger on his face.

“Respectful? That so-called brother Zhu of yours is not a good man at all," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said with a mocking look.

“Since when did someone as vile as you became qualified to speak ill of my brother Zhu?!”

Suddenly, Grandmaster Liangqiu let out a shout. Not only did he release his rank one Exalted oppressive might, but he even raised his fist and shot it toward the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Paaa~~~”

However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist raised his hand and effortlessly blocked Grandmaster Liangqiu’s fist.

“You!!!”

At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu was stunned. According to his memory, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s cultivation should be far inferior to his own. It should be impossible for him to block his punch.

“Hahaha~~~”

Suddenly, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into loud laughter.

Grandmaster Liangqiu was completely baffled by his laughter. At the same time, he became even more furious. Angrily, he asked, “What are you laughing about?!”
