Chapter 4057 - You Witch

“Is it the Wuming Clan?”

“Are you here to stand up for the Wuming Clan?”

“But, you’re not from the Wuming Clan. Exactly who are you?”

“If you’re a man, then stand straightforward and upright. Do you dare to say your name?”

Chu Feng spoke with a stern voice.

However, after he said those words, Lanfu Jianpeng narrowed his brows, and his expression turned ugly.

He did not expect Chu Feng to be able to guess that he had come to stand up for the Wuming Clan in an instant.

It was not hard to guess. After all, Chu Feng had just beaten back the Wuming Clan. And, not long after that, that man had come to make trouble.

In terms of possibilities, this man was most probably a helper of the Wuming Clan.

However, this so happened to be what Lanfu Jianpeng did not wish to expose.

Mainly, he did not wish to expose his identity as someone from the Blue Talisman Clan.

As such, when Chu Feng associated him with the Wuming Clan... the killing intent in his eyes grew even more intense.

“Trash who thinks himself clever, die!”

After saying those words, he raised his arm and then sent it down abruptly.

His action covered the entire area.

The life and death of everyone present would be altered by his single action.

But, when his arm landed, the oppressive might and killing intent filling the surroundings suddenly disappeared.

It was not only Chu Feng and the others that were bewildered by this scene; even Lanfu Jianpeng was completely bewildered.

What happened?

Even though his palm strike earlier shouldn’t be able to eliminate the entire Chu Heavenly Clan, everyone within his line of sight, the areas covered by his oppressive might, should’ve died.

Yet, he discovered that not only did no one die, even his oppressive might and aura had been suppressed.

Who? Who did that?

“You... want to wipe out the Chu Heavenly Clan?”

At the moment when everyone was confused, a little girl’s voice was suddenly heard.

Then, a figure appeared. That figure landed beside Chu Feng.

That little girl was someone that Chu Feng and the others were familiar with. She was Bai Liluo.

“Big sister Liluo?”

“You’ve exited your closed-door training?”

Chu Feng was overjoyed to see Bai Liluo.

Not only did she appear very healthy, but Chu Feng also discovered that it was not that the blue-gowned man did not want to kill them, but rather that his killing intent and oppressive might had been suppressed by someone.

That person was none other than Bai Liluo.

Bai Liluo’s cultivation had increased greatly after undergoing her closed-door training. Her strength... was most likely superior to that of the blue-gowned man’s.

“I originally did not plan to come out this early, as I was at a crucial junction in my training.”

“However, I sensed that you were in danger. Thus, I had no choice but to come out.”

“I couldn’t allow you to be killed before coming out, no?” said Bai Liluo.

Chu Feng was at a loss as to what to say after hearing that.

Emotions filled his eyes.

“Enough, leave this matter to big sister,” Bai Liluo said to Chu Feng.

“Roar~~~”

Suddenly, roars sounded. An enormous amount of martial power bombarded them from the sky.

Looking up, they could see many ferocious martial power beasts.

Every one of them measured a hundred meters. They all possessed enough power to eliminate all the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

There were tens of thousands of such ferocious beasts.

Their number could no longer be described as a pack of beasts. Instead, they were a sea of beasts.

The giant wave composed of ferocious martial power beasts smashed down from above.

They intended to kill everyone present.

“Roar~~~”

However, all of a sudden, screams began to sound in succession.

The tens of thousands of beasts began to crumble and disintegrate.

It was Bai Liluo.

She did not even move. Merely by revealing her killing intent, she was able to decide the life and death of those ferocious martial power beasts.

“Big sister Liluo, you...”

Seeing Bai Liluo who stood beside him, Chu Feng confirmed his guess.

Bai Liluo’s strength indeed surpassed that of the man. She was a rank six Utmost Exalted.

“Damn it!”

Evidently, after Bai Liluo had beaten back the blue-gowned man’s attack, he’d realized that the seemingly unremarkable little girl possessed a cultivation superior to his own.

Realizing that the situation was bad, he did not hesitate and immediately turned around to flee.

“Trying to leave?”

Bai Liluo spoke with a sneer. Then, she extended her little hand and gently grabbed in the man’s direction.

The blue-gowned man’s scream and the sound of his bones shattering resonated simultaneously.

The blue-gowned man who had come with overwhelming killing intent and proclaimed that he would wipe out the Chu Heavenly Clan earlier was falling from the sky like a loose kite. He ultimately crashed heavily into the ground.

“Little brother Chu Feng, what do you want to know from him?” Bai Liluo asked Chu Feng.

“Have him tell me if he came here to stand up for the Wuming Clan.”

“Also have him tell me who he is and where he came from.”

“Those are things that must be made certain of,” said Chu Feng.

“Very well.” Bai Liluo nodded. Then, her body disappeared.

When she reappeared, she’d landed right on that blue-gowned man.

Bai Liluo pulled the blue-gowned man up into the air with her martial power. Lifted up, one could see that he’d been seriously injured.

When Bai Liluo descended from the sky and stomped ruthlessly on the man, his injuries had gotten even worse. That could be seen from the way his face had been distorted.

“Answer my little brother Chu Feng’s questions,” said Bai Liluo.

“Hahaha...”

A surprising scene occurred.

That man burst into loud laughter.

“Never would I have imagined that I’d fall in this sort of desolate place.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“However, I will not surrender to lowly trash like you.”

“Go ahead and kill me if you want. As for having me tell you who I am and where I’m from, you can forget about that,” Lanfu Jianpeng spoke with an unyielding voice.

“You’re quite tight-mouthed. I wonder, will your stubbornness be stronger, or will my methods?”

As Bai Liluo spoke, she flipped his wrist, and a transparent rod appeared in her hand.

That rod appeared incomparably hard. However, the center of the rod was hollow.

“Puchi~~~”

After she took out the rod, Bai Liluo thrust the rod into that man’s body.

“Buzz~~~”

Runes and symbols then appeared on the rod.

The blue-gowned man began to scream miserably.

Upon looking closely, Chu Feng noticed that blood was flowing into the hollow rod.

The blood was naturally being drawn from the blue-gowned man.

However, that was most definitely not ordinary blood. Otherwise, the man would not be screaming so miserably.

“Don’t scream like that, others who don’t know what’s going on might think that I’m torturing you.”

“Even if you’re going to scream, you should scream later.”

“After all, this is only the beginning.”

Bai Liluo looked at the blue-gowned man with a beaming smile.

Hearing those words, Lanfu Jianpeng gritted his teeth, and looked to Bai Liluo.

He wanted to curse her out.

However, the instant his gaze landed on her, he was immediately stunned.

He was astonished to discover that before Bai Liluo, were dozens of those transparent rods.

A single rod was already able to bring him such miserable pain. Lanfu Jianpeng began to imagine what would happen if the dozens of rods were all inserted into him; what sort of miserable pain he would have to endure.

“You damned witch! You damned witch!”

Suddenly, Lanfu Jianpeng started to curse loudly.

Faced with his curses, Bai Liluo not only did Bai Liluo not become angry, but the corners of her mouth even rose into a smile.

Seeing that smile, Lanfu Jianpeng, almost crumbled in despair.

It was a wicked smile that he had never seen before!
