Chapter 4152 - A Desolate Land

Upon entering the entrance, one would automatically fall towards the Endless Abyss.

Even if one decided to back out midway, one would not be able to return, as there was a power forcibly pushing everyone downard.

Furthermore, every entrance seemed to have their own special route. One could only follow that path downward.

Finally, Chu Feng and Long Daozhi were free from the restriction. Their feet finally landed on the ground.

They arrived in the Endless Abyss.

The Endless Abyss was different from their imagination.

This place was pitch-black. Only by using special observational methods could one see one’s surroundings.

Furthermore, that place was extremely desolate. Loess filled the ground and sand filled the air. Even though they were clearly underground, the surroundings were like a barren desert.

Apart from the special formation above their heads causing them to be unable to return the way they had come, no spirit power could be sensed in their surroundings.

In fact, even the dangerous aura they’d felt outside had disappeared.

This sort of transformation was rather strange.

Moreover, this place was simply too vast.

The vastness of that place could be indirectly embodied by Chu Feng’s perception.

Chu Feng’s current spirit power was extremely strong.

When he was serious, his spirit power could cover a range of ten million meters, and detect everything within that area.

Yet, Chu Feng was unable to detect the existence of any individuals, even with his spirit power spread to its limit.

This meant that apart from him and Long Daozhi, there were no other people in the surrounding ten million meter radius.

Yet, there were clearly people that had entered the Endless Abyss before them. Furthermore, they’d all entered through the entrances above.

Because of that, Long Daozhi’s brows narrowed.

Simply no clue could be found in such a desolate place. Trying to find Dragon Vein Source Stone in a place like that would be akin to fishing a needle from the sea.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng spoke. “Senior, don’t worry. This junior will definitely help you obtain that Dragon Vein Source Stone.”

He had detected Long Daozhi’s worries.

Long Daozhi looked at Chu Feng. After he saw Chu Feng’s confident smile, half of his suspended heart was lifted.

He understood Chu Feng. Chu Feng was not someone to boast about things he couldn’t handle.

“Young friend Chu Feng, in that case I’ll have to trouble you with this,” said Long Daozhi.

“They’re here.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng raised his head and looked in the direction they had come from.

Soon, the leaders of the other four powers as well as the four world spiritists descended from the sky and landed beside Chu Feng and Long Daozhi.

When the four world spiritists saw Chu Feng again, unease filled their faces.

After all, they’d suffered an extraordinary humiliation earlier because of him.

“Four seniors are truly kindhearted,” Chu Feng said to the four leaders.

“Young friend Chu Feng, what might you mean by that?” asked the four leaders in confusion.

“If seniors weren’t kind-hearted, you wouldn’t have attacked those four good-for-nothings so lightly.”

“After all, they wasted four opportunities.”

“As for those opportunities, they were obtained by you all using your bloodline power and lifespans,” said Chu Feng.

“What else do you want?! Do you want us dead?!” shouted one of the four world spiritists.

He was truly enraged.

If it hadn’t been for Chu Feng they wouldn’t have received such humiliation.

Yet, even after they had been punished, Chu Feng was still pressing them.

He was simply trying to kill them.

“Shut up!”

“Do not be rude towards young friend Chu Feng!”

However, right after that man spoke, he was angrily rebuked.

Furthermore, it was not Long Daozhi that had rebuked him. Instead, it was the leader that had invited him there.

If he had been rebuked by Long Daozhi he might dare to retort. However, being scolded by that person made him shut his mouth right away.

After all, that leader had expressed his killing intent earlier.

He did not dare to offend the leader again in the slightest.

He knew that he had to give his all in the trial. Else... he really might not be able to return alive.

It was as Chu Feng had said, they had indeed wasted four opportunities that those leaders had used their lifespans and bloodline power to obtain.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you don’t need to bother with them.”

“Besides, we are allies. For some things it’s better to let them pass.”

“That’s right. We should instead focus on what’s ahead.”

After the world spiritist was reprimanded, the four leaders turned to speak to Chu Feng with smiles on their faces.

None of them dared to offend Chu Feng. Instead, they were lifting him up like he was their ancestor.

“Rest assured. I, Chu Feng, am not someone who will bicker about things without end,” said Chu Feng. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“In that case, young friend Chu Feng, where should we go now?” asked the four leaders.

The inside of the Endless Abyss was simply too vast. They simply had no idea what path to take.

They had no choice but to rely on Chu Feng. After all, they could all tell that his world spirit techniques were much stronger than their four world spiritists.

However, Chu Feng did not directly answer them. Instead, he looked to Long Daozhi, “Senior Long, are we going to bring them along?”

Once Chu Feng’s words left his mouth the four leaders were so terrified that their faces changed color.

They would still need to rely on Chu Feng. If he decided not to bring them along anymore then they would suffer a massive loss.

“We should bring them along. After all, we’re allies.”

“However, let me talk about the unpleasant things first. From now on, all of you will have to listen to my instructions.”

“If you all are able to listen obediently, I will act in accordance with our prior agreement, and split the Dragon Vein Source Stones with you all should we find them.”

“However, if you refuse to listen, then do not blame me for being ruthless,” said Long Daozhi.

‘What?’

‘Ruthless?’

Hearing Long Daozhi’s words, the four leaders were all enraged.

The person they were relying on was Chu Feng.

They still deeply looked down on Long Daozhi.

For Long Daozhi to dare to speak with them in such a manner, it was only natural for them to be displeased.

However, as Chu Feng had been invited by Long Daozhi and their relationship seemed to be very good, the four leaders could only tolerate their displeasure and put a smile on their faces.

With that, the crowd began to proceed following Chu Feng’s instructions.

However, they’d only journeyed for a short while before the four world spiritists pointed out that Chu Feng’s direction was wrong.

As the four of them were renowned world spiritists themselves, they all had their own observation methods.

According to their observation methods, they could sense that the direction Chu Feng was proceeding toward was extremely desolate. It did not seem like a place where one could find a Dragon Vein Source Stone.

Actually, Long Daozhi and the leaders of the other four powers were also world spiritists themselves.

Although their world spirit techniques could not compare to that of vChu Feng and the four Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists, they still had perception and observation methods.

They had been examining their surroundings the entire time. The results of their observations were identical to the other four world spiritists.

However, as Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were stronger, they did not believe those four world spiritists when they voiced their dissent and instead lashed out at them.

With that, even if the four world spiritists had objections, none of them dared voice them again.

But, after they continued to journey for an entire day, they still hadn’t discovered anything.

Instead, the desolate aura that surrounded them had grown even more intense.

With the situation being like that, even though Long Daozhi still firmly believed in Chu Feng, the four other powers’ leaders became impatient.

Finally, someone voiced their doubts. “Young friend Chu Feng, is the path we’re proceeding toward really the correct one?”

“If you think that my path is incorrect then you can all very well turn around with your world spiritists and proceed towards the path that you believe to be correct.”

“Why bother asking this?” Chu Feng coldly rolled his eyes at that leader.

Finally, at the end of her patience, that leader, an old lady, shouted angrily, “Impudent!”

“Whilst we respect you, we’re not afraid of you!”

“Watch your tone when you speak!”

Although she was an old lady, she looked extremely fierce.

She had insulted Long Daozhi multiple times when they had met. She had also insulted Chu Feng when he first arrived. She had not placed Chu Feng and Long Daozhi in her eyes at all.

The reason why she had ended up exercising forbearance afterwards was because she wanted to make use of Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques.

However, after proceeding for an entire day at a rapid speed without any results, and seeing how Chu Feng and Long Daozhi’s attitudes had been rather vile toward them the entire time, anger had been accumulating in her heart the entire time.

Finally, her anger had exploded.

In fact, the old lady was not the only person who was angry. The other three leaders had also revealed their displeasures on their faces.

All four of them had been tolerant because they wanted to make use of Chu Feng.

If they were to discover that he did not possess any value, they would naturally have no need to continue to put up a pretense.

“Are you questioning me?”

“Very well.”

Faced with the old lady that had erupted with anger, Chu Feng was not only not enraged, he instead smiled. Then, he continued onward.

However, this time around, Chu Feng only proceeded onward for a short while before stopping.

After he landed, he pointed his palm downward. With that, a spirit formation was released from his palm. Once his spirit power landed on the ground, it immediately began to radiate with light.

The dazzling light made the desolate underground world magnificently bright.

At the start Long Daozhi and others were confused. They did not understand why Chu Feng would suddenly do that.

However, soon, their eyes started to shine.

Enveloped by Chu Feng’s spirit power, the plain and ordinary ground beneath them began to emit a powerful aura.

Perhaps that aura might not mean much to others.

But to Long Daozhi, the old lady and the other descendants of the Dragon Clan, it was something that brought them endless excitement. Even their blood began to boil.
