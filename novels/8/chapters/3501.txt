Chapter 3501 - Li Yue’er’s Mishap

“Lord Clan Chief, you have something else in mind?” that elder asked.

“It’s not that I have something else in mind. Merely, I do not wish to provoke that person,” the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Lord Clan Chief, you’re talking about Chu Xuanyuan?” that elder asked.

“Who else besides him? Currently, the forbidden area Chu Xuanyuan was imprisoned in has been sealed off. Furthermore, the spirit formation sealing it is so powerful that no one can breach it. No one even knows if Chu Xuanyuan is still inside that forbidden area. Judging from the current situation, it’s very possible that the spirit formation barrier sealing the forbidden area was set up by Chu Xuanyuan himself. It’s very possible that that man has returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“To be able to set up such a powerful spirit formation, it means that his current strength is already unrivaled by anyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield,” the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“No wonder. No wonder Chu Xuanyuan’s son would suddenly appear. So he’s actually backed by Chu Xuanyuan. It would appear that he is playing the long game. Even the Starfield Master Realm has fallen for his scheme.”

“In that case, wouldn’t it mean that the Starfield Master Realm will find it very difficult to keep their status even without the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s rebellion?”

The Tantai Heavenly Clan’s grand characters all became restless upon learning such news.

Chu Xuanyuan was a man capable of affecting the situation of the Ancestral Martial Starfield in its entirety. The Tantai Heavenly Clansmen did not dare to neglect him.

Chu Xuanyuan was already a headache to all the major powers when he was young.

Now that he had fully matured, how could he not be an even worse headache?

“If Chu Xuanyuan had wanted to retaliate against the Starfield Master Realm, he would’ve likely done so already. It would be impossible for him to wait till now,” said the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Lord Clan Chief, are you saying that Chu Xuanyuan is willing to forget about what the Starfield Master Realm did to him, and not bear recriminations against them?”

“But, Chu Xuanyuan has always been a person who will take revenge. He does not seem like someone magnanimous enough to let bygones be bygones,” the eyes of those Tantai Heavenly Clan’s elders started to flicker. They were deeply pondering the matter.

The Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head and forced a smile. “No one knows what that man is thinking.”

At that moment, the entire palace hall turned quiet.

They had to admit that what Tantai Xiangnan had said was very true. Chu Xuanyuan was indeed a man whose thoughts no one could guess..

That said, they also understood very well that, regardless of whether Chu Xuanyuan had returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield or not, regardless of whether that barrier was set up by Chu Xuanyuan or not, because the potential threat of Chu Xuanyuan was present, they absolutely could not provoke Chu Feng.

After all, they all knew that man’s viciousness very well.

“Bang!!!”

Suddenly, the shut gate to the palace was violently pushed open.

Following that, an old man rushed in with a look of panic.

Originally, some of the elders inside had wanted to curse that man out. After all, they were discussing secret matters. It was a major offense for someone to dare charge into the palace at such a time.

However, after the crowd took a clear look at who the intruder was, they suppressed the anger in their hearts.

The reason for that was because the person who had charged in was one of their Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders, Tantai Zuhui.

Not only was Tantai Zuhui a peak Exalted-level expert, but he was also an expert tasked with protecting the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Unless something major happened, he would definitely not personally rush over here, much less forcibly crash his way through the sealed off palace entrance.

Furthermore, panic could be seen all over his face. This most likely indicated that something major had happened within their clan.

“Elder Zuhui, what happened?” asked the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Lord Clan Chief, I’m afraid that the Black-feathered Specter has most likely truly reappeared,” replied Tantai Zuhui.

“Ah?”

“This!”

All the people in the palace hall immediately stood up upon hearing those words. At the same time that they were shocked, panic appeared to a greater or lesser degree in their eyes.

Even Tantai Xiangnan, the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s strongest expert, reacted in the same manner.

......

......

Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun were currently inside Chu Feng’s room.

Chu Feng informed Wuming Xingyun of what the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had asked of him.

Wuming Xingyun had actually already anticipated that the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would ask Chu Feng about that matter. Thus, he did not ask too much about it, and instead began to engage in small talk with Chu Feng.

“Young friend,” however, the two of them had only chatted for a short while before a voice suddenly sounded from outside.

Furthermore, after that voice was heard, a figure, without being invited in, pushed through the door to the room and entered.

Upon seeing that person, not only did Chu Feng reveal a smile, even Wuming Xingyun, who was originally somewhat displeased, revealed a smile.

“And here I was wondering who it was. So it was you, girl,” Wuming Xingyun said with a smile.

That unexpected guest was Li Yue’er’s older sister, Li Ruochu.

Judging from Wuming Xingyun’s reaction, Chu Feng knew that he not only knew Li Ruochu, but their relationship seemed to be pretty decent too.

“Senior, it has been a long time. Allow Ruochu to properly greet you,” with a sweet smile on her face, Li Ruochu bowed to Wuming Xingyun. That said, the degree of her bow was somewhat exaggerated. It seemed that Li Ruochu’s greeting was somewhat mischievous.

“You’re already grown, why are you still acting like a child?” Wuming Xingyun smiled and shook his head.

“Senior, what are you talking about? Am I not still a child?” Li Ruochu curled her lips.

“Yes, yes, yes. You’re right,” Wuming Xingyun revealed a look of helplessness. Then, he waved his sleeve and began to walk toward the door.

“My. Senior, where are you going?” Li Ruochu asked.

“Where else could I go? I’m giving the two of you some time alone. Girl, you couldn’t have come all the way over here to find me, no?” Wuming Xingyun put forth an appearance of slight annoyance.

As for Li Ruochu, she reacted with no fear, and waved her hand at Wuming Xingyun. “Senior, thanks then.”

“Oh you girl.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Seeing Li Ruochu like that, the annoyance disappeared from Wuming Xingyun’s face, and was replaced with a smile, “Go ahead and chat. This old man will keep watch for the two of you.”

By the time his voice was heard, Wuming Xingyun had already walked out.

“Senior, do you need something from me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Senior? You’re truly lacking in manners. Do you think that I’m several centuries older than you?”

“Call me big sister,” Li Ruochu rolled her eyes at Chu Feng.

“Big sister Ruochu, allow Chu Feng to properly greet you,” Chu Feng made the same sort of exaggerated bow as Li Ruochu did earlier.

“You’re right. Your big sister has come to find you because I need something from you,” Li Ruochu said.

“Big sister Ruochu, what is it that you need?” Chu Feng asked.

“My little sister has encountered a mishap,” Li Ruochu said.

“What?!”

The smile on Chu Feng’s face instantly disappeared, and his heart tensed up.

After all, Li Ruochu’s little sister was Li Yue’er.
