Chapter 4829: A Terrifying Enemy

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple sat there as if he was just watching a show. He seemed to have been there for a long time now.

Chu Feng had a decent impression of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. Even though the latter had provoked him, saying that he intended to settle the scores, he still never really saw the latter as an enemy.

Yet, at this very moment, he felt a dangerous vibe coming from the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was an enigmatic person, not just in terms of his unknown cultivation but his personality too.

It would be terrifying to make an enemy like that his enemy.

“You were here all along? If so, you should know why I wanted to kill Zuoqiu Youyu,” Chu Feng said.

“Brother Chu, you need not say anything more to him. I’ll explain things to Lord Sectmaster,” Duan Liufeng said.

“Elder Duan, do you think that you’ll be able to protect Chu Feng in your current state?”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple vanished right after saying those words. By the time he reappeared, he was already standing right beside Duan Liufeng. He raised his palm and struck the back of Duan Liufeng’s neck, knocking him out.

It had all happened too fast that Duan Liufeng was already knocked out by the time Chu Feng came to.

“What are you intending to do?” Chu Feng bellowed upon seeing that Duan Liufeng was in danger.

It was just that he was so feeble that he could hardly even get to his feet, let alone help Duan Liufeng.

“You can’t even protect yourself anymore, and you’re still trying to help someone else?”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple laughed softly before abruptly tossing a pill toward Chu Feng.

Chu Feng could tell that this medicine was beneficial to him. It was an extremely powerful recovery medicine that seemed to specifically treat his current condition.

“Chu Feng, are you willing to exchange your own life for Elder Duan’s?” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple asked.

“I was the one who killed Zuoqiu Youyu. Come for me if you want!” Chu Feng said.

“It looks like you’re willing. Chu Feng, are you an idiot? Remember that your life is more important than anyone else’s!” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple replied.

“What... do you mean?”

Chu Feng realized that the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple wasn’t really intending to harm Duan Liufeng.

“Look at how frightened you are. Don’t worry, I’m just intending to bring Elder Duan down the mountain. I have no intention of harming him. He’s in a feeble state right now, so it would be better for him to remain unconscious. As for your grudge with Zuoqiu Youyu, that has nothing to do with me at all.

“Rest for a bit before proceeding up the mountain. Zi Ling has already gone down the mountain and Zuoqiu Youyu is dead now. It looks like you’re the only one who can accomplish my master’s mission now,” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said.

“Why don’t you head there yourself? I can bring Brother Duan down the mountain while you finish up the mission,” Chu Feng said.

“Heh... It’s not that I don’t want to scale the mountain but...

“Forget it. Cut the crap and swallow the medicine. You’ll heal up much faster afterward,” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple’s voice echoed, but he had already vanished from sight with Duan Liufeng.

Chu Feng wasn’t sure if the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple had really left or not, but he swallowed the pill anyway. He also couldn’t confirm if the other party would harm Duan Liufeng or not, but he had no choice but to believe him.

At this moment, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple had indeed started rushing down the mountain, but he didn’t meet up with the sectmaster right away.

Instead, he started scouring the mountain with Duan Liufeng on his back.

At the bottom of the mountain was a group of people patrolling the area in search of something. There were both juniors and elders amongst them, and the elders had all reached Martial Exalted level.

As for juniors, some of them were familiar faces to Chu Feng.

They were the ones who had approached him and Zi Ling in the mountain formation earlier in hopes of snatching Zi Ling away, the disciples of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo.

Clearly, they were looking for Chu Feng to avenge their disciples.

There were quite a few people walking out of the mountain, but they would step aside when they saw the group from the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo. They could sense murderous intent coming from them and didn’t want to provoke them.

However, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple walked straight toward them with Duan Liufeng on his back.

“Excuse me, I noticed that the lot of you have despicable looks on your faces. Are you looking for someone?” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said.

“Who are you saying looks despicable? Are you tired of living?” a disciple of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo bellowed.

They were feeling infuriated at the humiliation they had suffered when someone suddenly provoked them at a time like this. Naturally, they wouldn’t take it kindly.

“Calm down, calm down, there’s no need to get angry. I came here just to ask you all a question. Is this the person you are looking for?”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple took out a scroll and unrolled it, revealing a painting of Chu Feng.

“Elder! That’s the person who injured us and severed Senior Zhao’s manhood!”

The disciples immediately howled in agitation upon seeing Chu Feng’s painting.

“You have seen this person? Where is he?” one of the elders of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo asked.

They thought that the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was here to tattle on Chu Feng’s location.

“So, you’re really looking for him? That settles things. I’m just here to confirm this,” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said as he rolled up the scroll.

“You brat! You dare to come here to ask us when you don’t know where he is? Are you looking for trouble?!” an elder of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo shouted.

“Hey hey hey, stop getting so jumpy at everything. It’s not like I’m going to hurt you or anything. Ah, I just remembered something. I do have something else I need of you,” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said.

“Scram!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Unwilling to waste their time with the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, the crowd from the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo was intending to move on.

“Where are you going? This is very important. You have to finish hearing me out first.”

However, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple rushed forward to block their way.

“Very important? Hurry up and speak then! If it turns out to be something unimportant, you need not dream of leaving this place intact!" the chief elder of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo said as a murderous intent flashed across his eyes.

He wasn’t just scaring the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple here. He was ready to go on a massacre if provoked further.

“It really is very important. To be frank with you, I’m here to kill all of you,” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said with a chuckle.

His light attitude made it seem like he was cracking a joke, but how could a joke like this be cracked so easily? For the already fuming crowd of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo, his action was no different from courting death.

“You’re asking for it.”

The chief elder of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo flitted right in front of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple in an instant and smacked his palm toward the latter’s face.

Everyone thought that the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple would die to this strike since they thought that he was nothing more than small fry, but they soon noticed that something was amiss.

Despite the powerful strike from their chief elder, it didn’t fall onto the enemy at all. On top of that, their chief elder’s body had begun trembling too.

As the chief elder’s back was faced to them, they had no idea what had happened. Nevertheless, an ominous premonition was starting to pound at their hearts.

It was only when their chief elder’s body suddenly collapsed to the ground that their faces started warping in shock.

“AHHHHH!”

The female disciples let out shrill cries whereas the male disciples and the other elders paled in fright.

The chief elder who had just attacked the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was not just the strongest one amongst them; he was also one of the top powerhouses of the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo.

Yet, the chief elder’s body had gone completely withered. Instead of a human, he looked more like a dry corpse that had climbed out of its grave!

It was as if his blood, flesh, and soul had all been sucked dry!

Without a doubt, he was dead.

“R-run...”

One of the elders muttered fearfully.

The next moment, the elders and disciples immediately turned tail and fled with all their might.

“Heh...”

A sinister laugh sounded from the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.

Everyone in the vicinity, regardless of how far they had run, suddenly froze in place and let out miserable cries. In a matter of moments, they had fallen to the ground as dry corpses.

The victims weren’t just limited to those from the Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo. Even those who had just happened to pass by and stopped to spectate the commotion weren’t spared either.
