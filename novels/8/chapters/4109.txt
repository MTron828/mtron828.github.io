Chapter 4109 - Mysterious Old Granny

By the time Chu Feng reacted to what had happened, he’d found himself inside the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast’s stomach.

However, he did not see Long Daozhi inside the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast’s stomach.

As such, Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eyes and began to look through the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast to see the situation outside. Upon doing so, he discovered that Long Daozhi had not been attacked.

It seemed like the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast had come for him. After it devoured him, it had turned around and left.

Whilst Long Daozhi being fine greatly eased the tension in Chu Feng’s heart, his condition was still extremely bad.

After he entered the Ancient Era’s heaven-devouring Beast’s stomach, he was enveloped by a gaseous substance.

Not only was that gaseous substance very foul smelling, it was also corroding his skin and destroying his body. Furthermore, it appeared to want to destroy his soul.

That Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast was treating Chu Feng as food, and trying to digest him alive.

Chu Feng tried his hardest to struggle free. Yet, no matter how hard he tried, his efforts were all useless.

The Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast was simply too powerful. Chu Feng was powerless to do anything to it.

As pain engulfed him, the aura of death began to permeate Chu Feng’s body.

He could even sense that he was getting closer to death, and gradually, lost consciousness.

......

“I’m alive?”

When Chu Feng opened his eyes again, he discovered that he was lying in a room.

He was also wearing a new set of clothes.

His Cosmos Sack had also been placed beside his bed.

Chu Feng examined his Cosmos Sack, and discovered that everything was still there.

In fact, the spirit formation placed on the Cosmos Sack was still there too. This meant that no one had even attempted to peer into it. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Who saved me?”

Chu Feng looked around. He discovered that there was an old granny outside the door.

The old lady was crouched in the garden over a clay pot. She appeared to be simmering something.

Chu Feng hurriedly walked out. He wanted to ask the old lady about what had happened.

“Young man, you’ve awakened.”

“Come, drink this bowl of soup. It will help with your injury.”

Right after Chu Feng walked out, the old granny poured the soup from the pot into a bowl.

She’d actually discovered that Chu Feng had woken up.

That said, what was crucial was not the fact that she had discovered Chu Feng had woken up so quickly. Rather, it was the bowl of soup.

That bowl of soup was emitting a thick aroma, and seemed like a delicacy.

It was filled with precious medicinal ingredients. Chu Feng could tell that the soup was really capable of curing his soul.

Furthermore, in order to prevent the soup from burning his mouth, the old granny had infused her spirit power into it, making the boiling soup lukewarm.

Through her spirit power, Chu Feng could tell that the old granny was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

However, Chu Feng was unable to tell what her cultivation was.

The feeling the old granny gave Chu Feng could be described with one word -- unfathomable!

“Thank you granny.”

Chu Feng accepted the soup and drained it in a single gulp.

Once he drank the soup, he felt completely relaxed and alert, and even full of vitality. The soup had brought enormous relief to the remaining pain to his soul.

“You must be very curious as to how you were able to survive after being swallowed by the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast.”

“Follow me. I’ll tell you the answer.”

As the old lady spoke, she walked out of the garden and began to lead the way for Chu Feng.

Chu Feng followed the old lady. At the same time, he carefully observed his surroundings.

There was an enormous group of palaces. There were over ten thousand palace’s there.

It would not be excessive to say that the place was a city.

However, apart from Chu Feng, there was only a single other person in that vast palatial area, the old granny.

As Chu Feng followed the old granny, he arrived at a palace hall.

There were many memorial tablets there.

Furthermore, the palace was filled with an Ancient Era’s aura.

The rock walls were engraved with murals.

The contents of the murals seemed to be the same. They were all scenes of cultivators in battle with ferocious beasts.

Whilst the appearances of the cultivators on the murals were all different, the ferocious beasts they were fighting all looked the same.

Those were all Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts!

“Senior, exactly who are you?”

Chu Feng was finally unable to keep himself from voicing that question.

“Just address me as granny. That feels more intimate,” the old granny said with a smile.

Then, she said, “You must not have heard of this world that you’re in right now.”

“Whilst this world is located in the Heaven-devouring Starfield, it is a hidden world.”

“As such, the cultivators of your era should not know about its existence.”

“This world is called the Heaven-devouring Beast Realm,” said the old granny.

“Heaven-devouring Beast Realm? Could it be that this place is where the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts reside?” asked Chu Feng.

“Correct. This place is the dwelling place of the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts.”

“The Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts are inside that blazing cliff.”

The old lady pointed into the distance.

Using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng looked in the direction that was indicated by the old lady.

He discovered that there was indeed a cliff far in the distance.

Flames were soaring out from beneath the cliff.

However, as the distance was simply too far, Chu Feng was only able to roughly see the cliff and the flames even with his Heaven’s Eyes. He was unable to examine the situation inside.

That said, even though he was merely roughly looking at it, Chu Feng was still able to sense that the cliff was filled with dangers.

“Granny, were you the one who saved me?” asked Chu Feng.

“No, it’s not me who brought you back here. It’s my granddaughter who brought you back.”

“She was also the one who changed your clothes,” said the old granny.

“Ah?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt an unknown sort of embarrassment.

A woman had changed his clothes?

Didn’t that mean that his naked body was completely exposed?

It would be one thing if that old granny’s granddaughter was a beauty.

But, if she was an ugly woman, wouldn’t it mean that he would’ve been taken advantage of?

It wasn’t that Chu Feng was disrespectful.

He felt respect for the old granny from the bottom of his heart.

Regardless of whether it was the old granny that saved him or not, merely the fact that she had boiled medicinal soup for him and helped treat his injuries was enough to make him consider her his benefactor.

However, that would be a completely different subject.

The old granny’s appearance was ugly, extremely ugly.

Judging from her current appearance, Chu Feng felt that she must have been ugly even in her youth.

“Young man, what’s with your expression?”

“You couldn’t possibly be thinking about devoting your life to my granddaughter, right?” The old granny suddenly asked with a mischievous smile.

“No, no, no...”

“Granny, I am merely feeling grateful.”

“I do not have any malicious thoughts,” Chu Feng explained in a hurry. He was terrified upon hearing the words ‘devote his life.’

“That’s good.”

“Whilst my granddaughter is very kindhearted, she’s extremely ugly.”

“Even I, her grandma, am unable to face her ugliness.”

“I believe that you will definitely not be able to tolerate her ugliness either,” said the old granny.

Chu Feng was very surprised to hear those words.

The old granny’s appearance could already be described as extremely ugly.

But, she actually described her granddaughter using those exact words.

Then, exactly how ugly must her granddaughter be?

Chu Feng suddenly became a bit curious.

He wanted to see exactly how ugly of a woman the old granny’s granddaughter was.

Perhaps she might be the ugliest woman Chu Feng had ever met.

“Granny, in that case... exactly who are you?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

He was simply too curious.

Earlier, he was surprised to learn that the legendary Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts were actually real and alive.

That said, he was confused as to why that Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast would suddenly appear after being gone for so long. Furthermore, why would that Heaven-devouring Beast attack him of all people?

Through the murals on the palace walls, Chu Feng had some guesses.

He felt that the old granny, her granddaughter and the people portrayed on the murals were most definitely not ordinary people.

They seemed to possess an extraordinary relationship with the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts.

Through the murals, Chu Feng felt that the clan the old granny belonged to seemed to be old enemies with the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts.
