Chapter 5853: Recognition of Strength

They would have never thought that Shengguang Xuanye had returned to surrender after meeting Chu Feng and the others, but they couldn’t understand why Shengguang Xuanye didn’t mention anything about that at all.

That could have at least lightened his sentence. It was two different notions for him to be caught and for him to surrender.

“I deserve to die a thousand times over. It’s only right for me to be punished, “Shengguang Xuanye said with a hoarse voice.

The lofty Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief was not the same man he used to be, not just in terms of appearance but in his heart too.

“You can accept your punishment later. For now, you can return his freedom here.”

Chu Feng had no intention of speaking up on Shengguang Xuanye’s behalf—the latter’s repentance didn’t change the fact that he had harmed him and his friends—but he shook his arm and shattered the chains binding Shengguang Xuanye.

“Hurry up and thank Chu Feng.” Shengguang Baimei smacked Shengguang Xuanye’s head.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I...” Shengguang Xuanye wanted to apologize with a quivering voice, but he didn’t know what to say.

“Shengguang Xuanye, do you know why I spared you that day? It is because you were willing to put your life on the line to defend the Holy Light Galaxy’s honor, or should I say that you wanted to uphold the dignity of the Holy Light Clan. If only your heart contained not just the interest of the Holy Light Clan but that of the entire Holy Light Galaxy, I’d imagine the situation between us to be very different from what it is now,” Chu Feng said.

Shengguang Xuanye didn’t say a word. He lowered his head, as his tears dripped on the floor. He knew that he had been selfish. He wouldn’t have been so desperate to eliminate Chu Feng if he hadn’t been so worried about the latter threatening the Holy Light Clan’s standing.

He had seen what Chu Feng had done earlier. If not for Chu Feng, their galaxy would have fallen to the Ancient Era’s clans. This made him regret his actions even so. He was grateful that he had failed, or else there wouldn’t have been anyone to protect the Ancestral Martial Galaxy today.

If so, he would have made a grievous mistake.

“Young friend Chu Feng, how did your cultivation grow so fast?”

“How do you cultivate? Did you stumble upon many fortuitous encounters?”

“Brother, I heard you’re Jie Ranqing’s son. Is that true?”

Many voices echoed around Chu Feng. They were curious to know what he had been through during his time out of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Rumors were ultimately just rumors. It was better to hear it from Chu Feng directly.

“Elders, let’s talk later on.” Chu Feng bowed to the elders before making his way toward a dignified lady. It was the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. He bowed and said, “Disciple Chu Feng pays respect to Lord Sectmaster.”

His position was not the same as before, now that he was celebrated as the number one junior in the universe, but he still showed respect to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

“Zi Ling has good eyes,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said with a smile as she supported him to his feet.

After Chu Feng stood up, he asked, “Lord Sectmaster, may I borrow your formation token?”

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster smiled. She formed a hand seal and took out a glowing token from her body. It was the token to control the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, she didn’t hand the token straight to Chu Feng. Instead, she projected Chu Feng’s image to the formation cores throughout the Ancestral Martial Galaxy and announced, “I’ll be entrusting our Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation to Chu Feng now.”

With those words, she passed the formation token to Chu Feng.

She had complete trust in Chu Feng. It was the same for everyone in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. There were even some who cheered upon learning that Chu Feng would take over the protective formation. This was what they hoped to happen.

Chu Feng gave them a strong sense of security.

Instead of immediately receiving the token, Chu Feng explained, “Lord Sectmaster, the enemy has used some means that I’m unable to see through. I’ll have to make some adjustments to the protective formation to reinforce it.”

“Feel free to do what you want, Chu Feng. Our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect unconditionally supports whatever you wish to do,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

Everyone from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, regardless of elder or disciple, raised their hands into the sky and cheered, “We support Chu Feng! We support Chu Feng!”

The deafening cheers filled Chu Feng’s heart with warmth.

His journey into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had been fraught with difficulties. Many disliked him, and some even tried to take his life. He was delighted to receive such strong support from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster now.

What Chu Feng didn’t know was that it wasn’t just limited to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

All over the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, in every realm, those who could see what was going on through the formation cores had their arms thrown in the air as they chanted his name.

It was the same in the realm where all of the top juniors of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy were gathered too. Zi Ling felt many emotions seeing such a sight. She knew better than anyone that it hadn’t been easy for Chu Feng to come this far.

The only reason Chu Feng was being celebrated now was because he was strong enough.

He had saved their lives, and that's why everyone was grateful to him. It was through the capabilities he had slowly refined by surviving danger time and time again that he won the acknowledgment of the world.

“Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, your words aren’t right. It’s not just your Hidden Dragon Martial Sect that supports Chu Feng but our entire Holy Light Galaxy,” a middle-aged man with white hair but a regal aura spoke up.

“Elder, you must be Lord Holy Master?” Chu Feng asked.

This was their first meeting, but Chu Feng could guess the other party’s identity.

“Yes, young friend Chu Feng. I heard that you’re an outstanding junior, but I see now that you’re far more than that. They were too reserved with their compliments. Your accomplishments are unrivaled in our galaxy. You have brought much pride to us,” the Holy Master said.

It was their first time meeting, but he was showing a lot of affection toward Chu Feng.

“It’s only right for me to do so,” Chu Feng said.

“Ha...” The Holy Master suddenly sighed. “I have heard about your affairs. I know that our Holy Light Galaxy has let you down. We had been an obstacle rather than a supporting force for your talents to blossom. I’m grateful that you don’t hold a grudge against us.”

“Enough, there’s no point saying all these now,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

“Yes, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster is right. Let’s spare the pleasantries for now. Chu Feng, feel free to do whatever you want to. We support you,” the Holy Master said.

With those words, Chu Feng began channeling the formation.
