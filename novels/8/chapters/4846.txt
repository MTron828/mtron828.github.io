Chapter 4846: A Young Lady’s Voice

Chapter 4846: A Young Lady’s Voice

“Chu Feng, I’ll say the same thing as before. Do not divulge anything about me to others. Just treat it as if you have never seen me,” Lord Long Xie said.

At the same time, a spirit formation gate materialized in front of Chu Feng.

Lord Long Xie was going to set Chu Feng free.

Yet, when the spirit formation gate finally appeared, Chu Feng suddenly didn’t feel like leaving anymore. He was extremely curious about the owner of the mysterious voice, so he wanted to pose some questions.

Hu!

But before he could say anything, the spirit formation gate suddenly released a suction force that forcefully pulled him in. He passed through the spirit formation gate and returned to the sky above the Hidden Dragon Square.

However, he realized that he wasn’t the only one in the area.

There were sect members of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect searching the area frantically, shouting his name. Some of them had worried looks on their faces, and some of them even burst into tears.

It was one thing for those who were close to Chu Feng, but he realized that some whom he had never met before were crying too. This was especially so for the female disciples.

They were acting this way because they thought that Chu Feng had died together with the calamity. So, when Chu Feng finally reappeared in the world, the first person who spotted him couldn’t believe his eyes.

“Is that Chu Feng? Am I seeing things?”

“Everyone, look! I-is that... Chu Feng?”

“Chu Feng? That... does look like Chu Feng!”

With all of the shouting going all about, it didn’t take long for everyone to notice Chu Feng.

Countless figures suddenly darted toward Chu Feng, causing him to be swarmed by a sea of humans within seconds. However, he welcomed it since the one leading the charge was the person whom he missed the most.

Zi Ling.

“Big brother Chu Feng, where did you go?”

Tear stains could be seen on Zi Ling’s cheeks, and her eyes looked puffy. It was apparent just how worried and anxious she was.

“Silly girl. The calamity has already been broken, so how could anything happen to me? I was just brought into another space while dealing with the calamity and ended up being trapped there for a while,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He didn’t reveal the complete truth since the mysterious voice had told him not to reveal his existence.

Chu Feng knew that the mysterious existence possessed strength above that of the sectmaster, so he dared not to go against his instructions.

Zi Ling and the others didn’t doubt his words at all. All they were concerned about at the moment was Chu Feng’s safety, and everything else was of secondary concern.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

All of a sudden, the crowd that was swarming around Chu Feng suddenly descended to the ground. By the time he realized what was going on, everyone, be it elder or disciple, was already on the ground

All of them lowered their heads and bowed deeply to him. No one spoke a word, but the formality was more than enough to convey their feelings.

Chu Feng felt his heart thumping hard.

This was the earnest respect coming from everyone in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

He couldn’t help but recall how he got oppressed from the very moment he joined the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. It was as if everyone viewed him as an eyesore and wanted to bring him down. The moment he showed any kind of accomplishment, trouble would come knocking right after.

Everything that had happened to him made him acutely aware of the vileness in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

Regardless of how rife the competition and infighting was, at this very moment, the respect and gratitude they were showing toward Chu Feng were at least sincere. Chu Feng had managed to win their recognition and respect.

Who in this world wouldn’t want to earn the respect and recognition of others?

Those who were highly respected by others tended to be great people, and Chu Feng relished in the recognition of others too.

“Since we have managed to overcome the calamity, let’s all disperse and rest for the time being,” the sectmaster suddenly spoke up at a time like this.

No one dared to go against the sectmaster’s orders, so they quickly straightened their backs and headed to wherever they ought to be. It was just that the sect members couldn’t help but glance at Chu Feng while walking away.

Some of them directed smiles toward him and bowed again, but there were also some who turned to look at Zi Ling too. Most of those who looked at Zi Ling were women, and their gazes contained a hint of envy.

Everything that had happened today was like a dream, but they were well aware that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect would really be dissolved if Chu Feng hadn’t managed to break the calamity. They would all be forced out of this place.

The strongest expert in the sect might be the sectmaster, but the one who saved them today was Chu Feng.

Even the older generation felt respect toward Chu Feng, let alone juniors like them.

His valiant act had made him a hero in the hearts of many of the juniors. Naturally, he also caught the attention of many female disciples too. There were even some who tried to send voice transmission to him in an attempt to win his goodwill.

It was just that Chu Feng couldn’t be bothered to respond to any of them, which was why these female disciples were looking at Zi Ling in envy.

They realized that Zi Ling was the only one Chu Feng was interested in. Other than Zi Ling, no other women would be able to catch Chu Feng’s attention at all, no matter how beautiful or young they were.

They thought that Zi Ling was lucky to have a man that was both outstanding and devoted to her, and they envied her for it.

Those who thought that Chu Feng wasn’t worthy of Zi Ling before were now thinking that Zi Ling was the one who wasn’t worthy of Chu Feng.

All of a sudden, the sectmaster fainted without any warning.

Duan Liufeng, Chu Feng, and the others quickly rushed forward to check on her condition. Fortunately, even though she had lost consciousness, she seemed to be in a stable condition.

It was just that they couldn’t figure out the cause of the sectmaster’s sudden loss of consciousness. Left with no choice, they could only send the sectmaster back to her residence so that she could have a good rest.

Chu Feng followed the group too, hoping to figure out the reason behind the sectmaster’s abrupt fainting in order to help her. However, he wasn’t able to figure anything out at all.

It was then that he suddenly received a voice transmission.

“Chu Feng, come out for a moment.”

It was from the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was still as enigmatic as ever. He wore a mask on his face, making it hard for Chu Feng to figure out his identity.

Chu Feng was intending to ask the sectmaster about the identity of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, but who could have thought that the sectmaster would suddenly lose her consciousness before he could ask anything at all?

He knew that the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple had sent him a voice transmission because he didn’t want to involve the others in this, so he also replied via voice transmission too.

“Is something up?”

“It’s about time to settle our scores,” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple replied.

“Who are you? Do we know one another?” Chu Feng asked.

Even at this point, he still didn’t know who the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was, let alone figure out what ‘settle our scores’ meant. He was really intrigued by it.

“Heh, do you really not remember it at all?” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple asked with a smile.

Chu Feng felt his heart tense up when he heard those words. The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple’s voice had changed. It was no longer the masculine voice of a man but the sweet voice of a young lady.
