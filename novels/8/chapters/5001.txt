Chapter 5001: Cage

“Netherworld Sect?”

Those words brought about shocked looks on the faces of everyone present. They had all heard of the Netherworld Sect.

They were a group of people dressed in red robes and a white veil. They went around finding talented cultivators to plant terrifying monsters in their bodies, turning them into fools.

Song Yun had also fallen prey to the Netherworld Sect as there was the same terrifying monster inside of her as well. However, due to Song Yun’s special constitution and the Godwish Grandmother’s means, Song Yun didn’t turn into a fool. Nevertheless, she still suffered greatly under it.

“I’ve heard of the Netherworld Sect. Elder, are you bringing us to meet someone from the Netherworld Sect?”

Chu Feng suddenly had an ominous feeling.

“Indeed, we’re meeting someone from the Netherworld Sect,” the Godwish Grandmother replied.

“Will the people from the Netherworld Sect be able to treat Yun’er?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked.

From her expression, it was apparent that even the great Lady of Dao Sea was fearful of the Netherworld Sect.

“Since you know of the Netherworld Sect, you should be aware of their deeds. They are a bunch of vile people who have gone around hurting talented children, and the monster inside Yun’er’s body was planted by that man. However, Yun’er’s situation is a little different.

“The envoy from the Netherworld Sect didn’t harm Yun’er right away. Instead, he told me that Yun’er has an unusual condition and would die at this rate, but he has the ability to save her. Yun’er was indeed in a bad condition back then. Left with no choice, I went along with him.

“I was still worried at the start, but the moment he planted the monster inside Yun’er’s body, her condition started to improve. Perhaps due to the peculiar nature of Yun’er’s condition, he has been keeping in contact with me over the years. He said that if Yun’er’s condition ever deteriorates, I can look for him and he’ll treat her. That’s why I know where he’s at,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

“You’re really intending to approach the Netherworld Sect for help?” Shengguang Baimei asked with a hint of fear on his face.

“I don’t want to get involved with them either, but this is Yun’er’s only hope right now,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

“That won’t do. The Netherworld Sect is too dangerous. Go on your own if you want to.”

Shengguang Baimei shook his head vehemently. He even turned to Chu Feng and said, “Young hero Chu Feng, we mustn’t go together with them.”

“Those from the Netherworld Sect are only interested in highly talented children. Cultivators beyond that age group don’t pique their interest. He won’t hurt you as long as you don’t run your mouth. Think about it, if the Netherworld Sect is truly interested in devastation, the entire Eastern Region would have been in shambles by now.

“Of course, if you’re still worried about it, I can bring Yun’er there myself and meet with you later on,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

“Elder, I’ll go with you. I’m interested in meeting an envoy from the Netherworld Sect,” Chu Feng said.

“This… Forget it! Since young hero Chu Feng insists on it, let’s head there together. I don’t believe that an outsider would be able to do anything to us in the Eastern Region!”

Shengguang Baimei changed his words.

Chu Feng could tell that Shengguang Baimei was afraid of the Netherworld Sect, so he told him that there was no need for him to tag along. However, Shengguang Baimei insisted on going with him, likely because he was worried for Chu Feng.

In fact, Shengguang Baimei could have simply returned to the Holy Valley now that the Godwish Grandmother was with them, but he still chose to come along because he was worried for Chu Feng. He was afraid that the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea would renege on their promise and harm Chu Feng. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Of course, he also knew that he wasn’t a match for the Godwish Grandmother, but he thought that he could at least buy time for Chu Feng.

To be honest, Chu Feng had a horrible first impression of Shengguang Baimei. He thought that the latter was arrogant, vicious, domineering, and had little regard for the life of others. However, his impression of the latter improved for the better later on.

Shengguang Baimei was fiercely loyal to the Holy Valley and his friends. Just that in itself was enough to win Chu Feng’s admiration.

It might be a stretch to say that Shengguang Baimei was a good man, but he was definitely a good friend.

It was extremely hard to track the whereabouts of those from the Netherworld Sect. After all, they were constantly on the move, searching for talented children to plant a monster in their bodies. However, this particular Netherworld Envoy had been maintaining contact with the Godwish Grandmother, which was why the latter knew of his whereabouts.

He was currently in an Ordinary Realm of the Nine Souls Galaxy.

Chu Feng and the others would be extremely close to the Ordinary Realm once they passed through a teleportation formation, but just as they were about to reach the exit, they suddenly encountered an extremely powerful barrier that blocked their path.

“What a powerful barrier! Is this a formation from a God-cloak World Spiritist?” Daoist Niantian exclaimed.

At the same time, Chu Feng and the others also began examining the barrier with frowns on their faces. The barrier was so powerful that it was beyond what a Saint-cloak World Spiritist was capable of pulling off.

It would take either a Half-God level cultivator or a God-cloak World Spiritist to breach the barrier.

Shoosh!

While Chu Feng and the others were rendered helpless before the barrier, the Godwish Grandmother placed a black talisman on her palm and formed a series of hand seals.

Weng!

The talisman disintegrated into a surge of energy that fused with the barrier. A spirit formation gate soon appeared on the barrier, allowing Chu Feng and the others to pass through.

“Big sister, is that black talisman from that man from the Netherworld Sect too?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked.

“Mm. He’s worried that I would be blocked out by his barrier, so he handed the talisman to me in advance,” the Godwish Grandmother replied with a nod.

Chu Feng and the others were able to successfully travel out of the teleportation formation, but what they saw afterward startled them. The first thing they saw was the barrier that had blocked them out while they were in the teleportation formation.

The barrier covered the entire sky, stretching to the horizons of the world. It was just that they were all world spiritists, so they could immediately discern what was going on.

The barrier didn’t just lock out the teleportation formation; it had sealed off the entire Ordinary Realm.

“Big sister, do you know what the Netherworld Envoy is doing here?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked.

She noticed that the barrier had an unusual structure that served not to keep things out but to lock things in. In other words, it was a cage.

It went without saying that the purpose of a cage was to imprison something.

To go to the extent of turning an entire Ordinary Realm into a cage using such formidable means, what could the Netherworld Envoy be trying to imprison?
