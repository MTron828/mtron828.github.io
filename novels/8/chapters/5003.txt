Chapter 5003: Fusing Netherworld Embryos

The being held in the hand of the Netherworld Envoy was only the size of an egg, but it was actually an embryo. It had a sinister black appearance with red runes inscribed all over it. These runes were emanating a red gaseous flame, which made it look even eerier.

The black appearance was likely to be the embryo’s original appearance whereas the red runes were added onto it.

“So this is the monster?” Chu Feng asked uneasily.

After all, this was the culprit that turned countless prodigies into fools.

Furthermore, Chu Feng believed that the Netherworld Sect had malicious intentions for placing such things into the bodies of talented children, which was likely to breed these monsters using those talented children’s bodies.

If possible, Chu Feng would rather not allow that thing to enter Song Yun’s body.

However, there was no other choice here.

Thus, he could only watch helplessly as the Netherworld Envoy took out a dagger and slice a hole in Song Yun’s forehead. Then, he slipped the eerie embryo into her head.

After that, the Netherworld Envoy erased the injury with a swipe of his hand, looking as if nothing had happened at all.

Wu!

Soon, Song Yun let out a moan of pain. Her voice slowly grew louder, and before long, she had already started thrashing around.

Gah!

She opened her eyes and let out a long howl. Her eyes had already turned blood-red, and four beams of blood-red light gushed into the sky from her pupils.

“Milord, what’s going on?” the Godwish Grandmother asked worriedly.

It was clear that the situation wasn’t going well. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“You should be aware that the Netherworld Embryo is a life form too. There are now two different life forms trying to occupy the same body, so it’s only natural for them to resist each other. This is an ordeal that Song Yun has to overcome. She’ll die if she fails to hold on, but if she can grit her teeth and pull through, her condition will improve significantly. She’ll be much healthier than before,” the Netherworld Envoy explained.

“Milord, is there anyone who has survived this before?”

The Godwish Grandmother was actually trying to ask what were the chances of success.

“You’re a world spiritist yourself too. You should be aware that Song Yun’s condition brings about certain death. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have come to look for me. I only did this as a last resort too. At least she’ll have a sliver of hope this way.

“In order to create more outstanding prodigies for the world of cultivation, our Netherworld Sect has once conducted a large-scale experiment. We found 10,000 children in the vast world of cultivation and planted two Netherworld Embryos in their bodies simultaneously. In the end, only three of them survived,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

“Only three? W-what about the rest? A-are they all dead?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“Those who can’t withstand a single Netherworld Embryo would go mad. There is only one fate that can befall those who fail to withstand two Netherworld Embryos, and that’s death,” the Netherworld Envoy replied.

Upon hearing those words, the Godwish Grandmother looked at the suffering Song Yun, who looked like she might lose her life at any moment, and her eyes turned red. Her body began to tremble uncontrollably.

“On top of that, I can frankly tell you that the ideal timing to plant the Netherworld Embryo is when the child is within ten years old. The younger the child is, the greater the chances of success. Song Yun’s age has already exceeded this range, so I suggest that you mentally prepare yourself for the worst,” the Netherworld Envoy added.

That was yet another blow to the Godwish Grandmother, who was already on the verge of a mental breakdown.

“Milord, why didn’t you say that earlier?!”

Despite the Godwish Grandmother’s fear of the Netherworld Envoy, she still revealed a reproachful look toward the latter.

“I’ve already told you that Song Yun is bound to die at this rate if you don’t do anything at all. The chances might be slim here, but at least there’s still a sliver of hope,” the Netherworld Envoy replied.

“What’s your goal of planting those Netherworld Embryos into the body of those children? Is it to nurture the Netherworld Embryos?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.

He couldn’t hold himself back anymore. He wanted to know the goal of these people.

“Nurture the Netherworld Embryos? Child, you’re really underestimating our Netherworld Sect. The goal of our Netherworld Sect is to bring prosperity to the world,” the Netherworld Envoy replied.

“Through planting these monsters into the bodies of innocent children without consent? It’s one thing if it succeeds, but what if it fails? They could go insane or even lose their lives. Is that how you bring prosperity to the world? Have you considered the feelings of the parents who lost their children?” Chu Feng asked.

His tone remained rather calm, but it was clear that he was displeased at the Netherworld Sect.

“Chu Feng, stop talking.”

Numerous voice transmissions reached Chu Feng’s ears. They were from Daoist Niantian, the Lady of Dao Sea, Godwish Grandmother, and a few others. They could tell that the Netherworld Envoy wasn’t to be trifled with, so they were worried that Chu Feng would anger him.

Unexpectedly, the Netherworld Envoy didn’t lose his temper.

“That’s what the naive think. Child, remember this. There are bound to be sacrifices if you wish to make the world a better place. That’s a necessary path that humankind has to take to undergo metamorphosis,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

His words were high and lofty, carrying not a sliver of regret.

“In other words, you’re saying that the Netherworld Sect is filled with selfless individuals who have devoted themselves to a noble cause,” Chu Feng scoffed.

However, the Netherworld Envoy replied with a chuckle, “You can say so.”

Gah!

Song Yun’s cries suddenly grew even louder, and her body started to float in the air. Soon, the four beams of blood-red light began to converge. At the same time, faint red marks started appearing on Song Yun’s skin, and they slowly grew more pronounced with time.

These marks were the very same red runes on the Netherworld Embryo.

“T-this… Am I actually that lucky?”

The Netherworld Envoy began to tremble with excitement.

“Milord, what’s going on?” the Godwish Grandmother quickly asked.

“Godwish Grandmother, pray for heaven’s blessing. If I’m not mistaken, Song Yun is undergoing the fusion of Netherworld Embryos, an event that is practically only spoken of in the legends. If it works out, she will have a boundless future ahead of her!”

The Netherworld Envoy could hardly conceal his elation.
