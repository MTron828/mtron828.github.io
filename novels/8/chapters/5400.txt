Chapter 5400: The Strongest Sword?

“How are you feeling, Chu Feng?” Eggy asked.

“I’m fine, Eggy.” While assuring Eggy that he was fine, Chu Feng checked on her condition too, only to be delighted to discover that she had recovered. “Eggy, you have recovered?”

“I…” Eggy was taken aback.

She was so concerned about Chu Feng that she hadn’t checked on her own condition. It was only then that she realized that she had regained her cultivation, and a brilliant smile formed on her face.

“I… I have recovered! Furthermore…”

“Furthermore what?” Chu Feng asked.

“I shan’t tell you,” Eggy replied with a mischievous smile. She turned to the frost woman and asked, “Elder, were you the one who helped me?”

“Don’t thank me. Thank Chu Feng. He was the one who grasped this opportunity for you,” the frost woman replied. She opened her hand and passed the ten Life Crystals in it to Chu Feng. “The other Life Crystals were consumed while treating your world spirit. Here is the remaining ten.”

“Thank you, elder.” Chu Feng didn’t reject the Life Crystals, knowing how valuable they were. He glanced at the Asura Demon Tower and asked, “Elder, did I clear the trial?”

He had fainted shortly after releasing his demonic nature, and he had only just regained consciousness. Thus, he wasn’t sure if he had cleared the trial or not.

“You haven’t sensed it yet? Take a look at your own World Spirit Space,” the frost woman said.

“My World Spirit Space?”

Chu Feng projected his consciousness into his World Spirit Space, only to discover a black sword in it. Before he could take a closer look at that black sword, the black sword suddenly released a powerful suction force that furiously devoured his psyche.

Alarmed, Chu Feng quickly retracted his consciousness from his World Spirit Space. Much to his relief, the black sword didn’t continue absorbing his psyche. Otherwise, his life would have been in danger.

“Elder, what was that?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why don’t you ask your world spirit?” the frost woman asked.

“What is with the secrecy?” Eggy’s curiosity was piqued. She turned to Chu Feng and said, “Let me take a look.”

However, Chu Feng shook his head with a frown. He turned to the frost woman and asked, “Elder, will the sword harm Eggy?”

“It won’t,” the frost woman replied.

Chu Feng finally opened his World Spirit Space for Eggy to enter. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“This is?”

Eggy’s eyes widened in disbelief when she saw the black sword. She even rubbed her eyes as if she thought that she was seeing things. This was the first time she had reacted in this way.

“How did you obtain this sword?” Eggy asked the frost woman from the World Spirit Space.

“That’s none of your business. All you need to know it’s Chu Feng’s reward for clearing the eighteenth floor. However, it won’t be easy to control that sword. It’ll be best for you to give up on that sword if you aren’t confident about controlling it, or else it might just take your life. Also, I should advise you to leave this place as soon as possible. Otherwise, your friend might just lose his life,” the frost woman said.

A surge of teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng and brought him back to the dueling ground.

The phenomenon had just vanished, freeing the crowd from the pressure that had been crushing on them. However, the crowd appeared to have suffered a huge shock from the incident. Some were crying; some had dazed looks on their faces.

Even Bai Yunqing had fallen unconscious… though his condition was not just a result of the phenomenon but Shuang Yu’s formation too.

“Chu Feng!!!” Shuang Yu roared.

Her complexion was horrible after being subjected to the phenomenon’s pressure, but with her powerful spirit power, she was able to recover quickly and make a pre-emptive move. Killing intent poured out of her as soon as she noticed Chu Feng.

She didn’t know why Chu Feng would suddenly make a reappearance, but she knew that the situation had gone awry. She had a feeling that the earlier phenomenon had something to do with him, and that only made her even more uneasy.

It further convinced her that she mustn’t spare Chu Feng.

Thus, she thrust her palm forward to kill Chu Feng with her sheer spirit power!

However, Chu Feng suddenly morphed into a flash of light and dodged her attack. He first bolted toward the unconscious Bai Yunqing to scoop him up before disappearing into the sky.

It was the Divine Deer’s doing. She had noticed the danger Chu Feng was in and acted on her own accord.

Everything happened so quickly that both Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were already gone by the time anyone realized it.

“How could he…” Shuang Yu was horrified.

She couldn’t understand how Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing could have escaped under her eyelids, and they had moved so quickly that she didn’t even notice it at all.

“Shuang Yu!” a furious roar echoed.

Ling Sheng’er stepped forward to confront Shuang Yu. Unaware that Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing had made their escape, she thought that Shuang Yu had killed them.

Shuang Yu looked at Ling Sheng’er and immediately understood why she was confronting her. Thus, she said, “Don’t bother. He escaped.”

“Escaped? Who are you trying to deceive?”

Ling Sheng’er didn’t believe Shuang Yu’s words at all. She didn’t think that it was possible for Chu Feng to escape from someone as powerful as Shuang Yu.

“It doesn’t matter whether you believe me or not. They have indeed escaped.” Shuang Yu couldn’t be bothered to explain the matter to Ling Sheng’er.

She knew that Chu Feng was no ordinary world spiritist, especially given the means he had used to escape from her. This made her realize that she was in deep trouble. Her failure to eliminate him today would likely bite back at her in the future.

…

Meanwhile, the Divine Deer took Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing out of the Divine Inheritance Ground to a safer location. Chu Feng quickly checked on Bai Yunqing’s condition, and to his relief, the latter had only fainted out of feebleness.

“Thank you, elder,” Chu Feng told the Divine Deer.

He knew that he couldn’t have dodged Shuang Yu’s earlier attack with his own means. While he would have still survived the ordeal thanks to his father’s protection formation, the activation of the formation would have killed many innocent lives, including Ling Sheng’er and Bai Yunqing.

Thus, he was thankful for the Divine Deer’s help.

“You need not thank me. Know that I won’t be able to help you again in the short term after this. Also, I ought to inform you that the demonic beast you met in the Asura Demon Tower was very strong, even more so than the frost woman,” the Divine Deer said.

“I know,” Chu Feng said.

“Don’t interrupt me; I’m not done speaking yet. As powerful as that demonic beast was, it wasn’t the strongest being in that realm,” the Divine Deer said.

“Elder, do you mean to say that there’s an even stronger demonic beast inside the Asura Demon Tower?” Chu Feng asked.

“No, it wasn’t inside the Asura Demon Tower. It was outside,” the Divine Deer said.

“Outside? While the demonic beast was stronger than the frost woman, it was sealed inside the Asura Demon Tower, after all. If there’s someone stronger than the frost woman outside, that person is likely to be the true owner of the Divine Inheritance Ground!” Chu Feng remarked.

“That’s what I think too, but this is good news. The stronger the owner of the Divine Inheritance Ground is, the more powerful the treasure you received is likely to be,” the Divine Deer replied.

Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng quickly turned to Eggy and asked, “Eggy, what in the world is that sword?”

“I suspect that it’s the legendary Asura Sword,” Eggy replied.

“Asura Sword?”

Even though he was assaulted by the black sword’s suction force right away when he entered his World Spirit Space earlier, he did notice the word ‘Asura’ inscribed on the sword.

“Eggy, is that sword formidable?” Chu Feng asked.

“Formidable?” Eggy burst into laughter. “Let me put it this way. There are three strongest swords in the Asura Spirit World that are known for their unparalleled prowess, and one of them is the Asura Sword.”

“You’re saying that I have one of the strongest swords of the Asura Spirit World?” Chu Feng was stunned to hear that.

While the Asura Sword did pose danger to me, it would be worthwhile to brave this danger if the sword was really that formidable. Given how powerful the Asura Spirit World was, a weapon that was deemed to be one of its strongest swords was bound to be a priceless treasure.

“I can’t tell whether this sword is a real deal or not since I have never seen the Asura Sword in person, but even if this sword is an imitation, it’s no ordinary imitation,” Eggy said.
