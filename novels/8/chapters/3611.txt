Chapter 3611 - Becoming The Strongest

Chu Feng did not know what the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was thinking. He also did not hear the words spoken by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. Furthermore, he did not know that there was such a powerful protective formation in his body.

It was so powerful that even a True God expert felt afraid of it.

That protective formation was left in his body by his father, Chu Xuanyuan.

Merely, Chu Feng did not know about any of that.

In his memories, he only knew that he was attacked by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was so powerful that he simply could not defeat him. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted possessed the strongest power in the entire vast martial cultivation world.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted possessed True God-level martial power, and True Dragon-level spirit power.

Chu Feng had thought that he was doomed from the immense pain he felt.

Throughout the years, he had endured countless trials and tribulations, and experienced all sorts of pain.

From all those experiences, Chu Feng would not even frown, even if his body was being torn apart.

However, this time around, the pain was unbearable, even for Chu Feng. This was the greatest pain he had ever experienced.

It was the pain of having his soul torn apart.

However, gradually, the pain that covered his body started to ebb. In the end, the pain completely went away. Chu Feng’s body that was originally unable to move also started to recover.

Chu Feng opened his eyes to observe his surroundings. After doing that, he confirmed one thing...

He was really still alive!!!

Not only did he not die, but the power from the little girl was still present in his body.

It had not been removed by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was also sitting right beside him.

Even though the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s body was still wrapped in bloody bandages that made him appear very horrifying, he gave off a very serene feeling, much like an amiable old grandpa waiting for his grandson to wake up.

Even Chu Feng, who was nearly killed by him, was no longer so afraid after seeing him like that. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“You’ve awoken?”

Seeing that Chu Feng had awakened, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted let out a light laugh. There was even concern in his eyes.

“You didn’t kill me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why must I kill you?” asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“Don’t you want to obtain the power within my body?” asked Chu Feng.

“I do. Of course I do. However, millions of years have passed without anyone being able to obtain it.”

“Now that the power has chosen you, it means that only you are qualified to possess it.”

“It’s meaningless for this old man to snatch that power from you,” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted shook his head.

“Then, what about what you did earlier?” Chu Feng felt confused. After all, it did not seem like a pretense when the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had attacked him earlier. Chu Feng felt that the killing intent was real.

It was true that he was nearly killed by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“I was merely testing you to see if you were truly qualified to obtain that power.”

“Likely, you know what the final result is. You did not disappoint this old man. You’re determined to protect that power with your life. That determination of yours is not something possessed by ordinary people.”

“Thus, you have passed the test from this old man,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“Senior, tests will generally have a limit, and will stop when that limit is reached. This test of yours was simply too cruel, no?”

“I truly felt that I was on the verge of dying. No... I felt that I’d already died. It’s a miracle that I’m still alive. Even I don’t dare to believe that I’m still alive,” said Chu Feng.

“Hahaha. If I did not make the test more realistic, with how smart you are, brat, wouldn’t you be able to see through this old man?”

“Likely, compared to my test, the test it gave you should have been even more ruthless, no?” asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

The ‘it’ that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted mentioned was likely that little girl.

Chu Feng started thinking.

Although the little girl’s test was not trying to take his life like the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s test, it was extremely dangerous.

If Chu Feng had made a single misstep, he would’ve died by that little girl’s hands.

It had been a test of his moral character.

Thinking of that, Chu Feng acknowledged the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s words.

It was as the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had said, that little girl’s test was even more ruthless.

“Senior, in that case, are you able to tell me exactly what the power within me is now?” asked Chu Feng.

“Void Sacred Tree,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“Void Sacred Tree?” Chu Feng was surprised, “You said... it’s the Void Sacred Tree?”

“That’s right. It’s the Void Sacred Tree. It is the actual power of the enormous tree that you saw,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

Chu Feng did not say anything. However, his heart was unable to calm down.

He was extremely surprised. Even though he knew that the little girl was related to the Void Sacred Tree, he had never expected that the little girl was the Void Sacred Tree.

However, upon thinking carefully, that seemed to make perfect sense. After all, that little girl was capable of controlling everything.

Back then, Chu Feng was still in mid fusion with the little girl when the other powers started to bully the Chu Heavenly Clansmen in the Sacred Palace Hall.

It was the little girl who had caused the Sacred Palace Hall to tremble violently, and awaken the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others that were training on the Void Seats.

From this, it could be seen that the little girl was truly capable of controlling the power of the Void Sacred Tree.

“Actually, the Void Sacred Tree is merely a name that it gave itself as a disguise.”

“To be exact, what you obtained was God’s Power,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“God’s Power?” Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously upon hearing those words.

“It is an actual God’s Power. It isn’t something that a True God-level martial cultivator could compare to,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“Ah?” Chu Feng felt completely surprised.

To the current Chu Feng, the True God level was simply unattainable.

Earlier, to a greater or lesser degree, Chu Feng had experienced the power of a True God from the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

That was indeed so powerful that one would feel despair when facing it.

But according to what the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted just said, wouldn’t it mean that the little girl’s power was stronger than even his?

“In that case, it means that the power within my body is stronger than yours, senior?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course it’s stronger than this old man. I’m simply unable to compare to it.”

“However, Chu Feng, to tell you the truth, this old man has deceived you earlier,” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said all of a sudden.

“Ah?”

“Senior, what did you deceive me about?” asked Chu Feng.

“The current me does not possess the power of a True God. At the same time, I also do not possess the spirit power of a True Dragon World Spiritist,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“Is that so? In that case, does it mean that senior’s current martial power is at the Half God level, and your spirit power is at God-cloak level?” asked Chu Feng.

“Barely. I guess you can say that,” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted smiled profoundly. Then, he added, “However, this old man once possessed the power of a True God, and the spirit power of a True Dragon.”

“Sooner or later, I will regain my True God-level martial power. Likewise, I will regain my True Dragon-level spirit power.”

“No, to be exact, it will be Wang Qiang who will attain those things.”

“This old man will fuse with him soon. This old man will aid him in becoming a True God-level expert, and a True Dragon-level world spiritist.”

“Thus, Chu Feng, do you feel a lot of pressure that your brother will be aided by someone like this old man?” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted asked.

“Now that you speak of it, I do feel pressure. However, senior, I, Chu Feng, will also work hard. The True God realm is also a target of mine.”

“Speaking of it, senior might find it ridiculous, but the True God realm is actually not my final goal.”

“What I, Chu Feng, truly wish to become is not merely a True God-level martial cultivator.”

“Instead, I wish to become the strongest in this entire world,” said Chu Feng.
