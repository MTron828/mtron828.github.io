Chapter 4035 - Would’ve Done It Personally

“Asura, there shouldn’t be a need for you to go this far for the grievance that exists between us.”

“Must you do this? Must you insist on killing this old man?”

“Aren’t you holding onto this grudge too excessively?”

“This old man has truly misjudged you.”

Tuoba Chengan was not fierce with his words. Rather, he sounded like he was being greatly wronged. He was doing this with the hope of seeking a way to survive.

Seeing Tuoba Chengan like this, Chu Feng chuckled.

He was the one who knew best what sort of grievance there was between them.

With what Tuoba Chengan had done, Chu Feng would definitely not let him get away.

Because of that, he began to set up a spirit formation.

That spirit formation was emitting a bright golden light. It appeared to be incomparably sacred.

Once the spirit formation enveloped Tuoba Chengan, he immediately felt his pain lessening.

He could even feel his dantain being strengthened. Even his body and soul had been strengthened.

His vitality had become much stronger than before.

“Thank you young friend, thank you young friend!”

Tuoba Chengan thought that Chu Feng was sparing him.

As if he had received a new lease on life, he was moved to bitter tears as he kowtowed to Chu Feng with his hands held in front.

However, Chu Feng revealed a look of confusion. “Why thank me?”

“Young friend Asura is truly a grand and magnanimous person. To be willing to disregard our former hatred, this old man cannot thank you enough.”

“Young friend, you are this Tuoba Chengan’s second parent, my great benefactor. In the future, I, Tuoba Chengan, am willing to become your horse or ox without the slightest hesitation.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The more Tuoba Chengan spoke, the more emotional he became. He seemed like he was truly willing to serve Chu Feng.

Only he himself knew that even if Chu Feng really did spare him, he would not be grateful toward him in the slightest.

Rather, he would remember the fact that Chu Feng had nearly killed him. It would be one thing if no chance for revenge presented itself to him. However, should a chance for revenge appear in the future, he would definitely retaliate against Chu Feng.

This was the Tuoba Chengan’s true nature.

He was vicious, merciless, despicable and cunning.

Conscience? That was something that did not exist in someone like him.

It must be said that Tuoba Chengan was an extremely good actor. If it were someone else seeing him act like that, they might really end up being deceived by him.

However, since it was Chu Feng, he would naturally not be deceived.

Seeing the hypocritical Tuoba Chengan, the smile on Chu Feng’s face grew even more intense.

“You’re overthinking things. My spirit formation is not meant to spare you.”

“It’s just that I saw that your body is extremely weak, and thus decided to use my spirit formation to strengthen it a bit,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

“You... what do you mean by that?”

Tuoba Chengan suddenly stopped and an ugly look appeared on his face. He realized that things were not as simple as he had thought.

“How could you be so slow-witted? You were the All-heaven Sect’s Supreme Elder. If this is the degree of your comprehension ability, it’s simply too lacking, no?”

As Chu Feng laughed, he looked at Tuoba Chengan with a mocking gaze.

“Exactly what are you implying?”

Tuoba Chengan’s face became gloomy. He felt more and more that Chu Feng was not healing his injuries out of kind intentions.

“Forget it, forget it. I’ll let you die with some understanding.”

“I decided to treat your injuries and strengthen your vitality because I don’t want you to die too easily.”

“Do you understand what I’m saying?”

Chu Feng had a complacent smile on his face as he said those words.

After saying those words, he even took a glance at the monstrous beasts.

Seeing that, Tuoba Chengan finally came to a realization.

Chu Feng was planning to ruthlessly torture him. That was why he bothered to use a spirit formation to treat his injuries.

Realizing the truth, Tuoba Chengan was immediately disheartened.

Overwhelmed with fury, he even cursed out loud, “Asura, you damned animal! You shall suffer a miserable death!”

Knowing that survival was past him, Tuoba Chengan cursed Chu Feng and rushed toward him.

His plan was to put up a life and death struggle against Chu Feng.

However, he was no match for him even with his dantian intact; how could he possibly be a match for Chu Feng with his dantian injured?

Chu Feng casually waved his hand. His hand didn’t even touch Tuoba Chengan. Merely the wind brought forth by the movement of his hand was enough to flip Tuoba Chengan to the ground.

Furthermore, after falling to the ground, Tuoba Chengan didn’t even have the strength to crawl back up.

He, the grand All-heaven Sect’s Supreme Elder, was as weak as a powerless old man before Chu Feng.

The reason for that was not because his dantian had been pierced through.

It also had to do with the spirit formation Chu Feng had set up.

Although the spirit formation strengthened and revitalized Tuoba Chengan, it restricted his remaining powers and turned him into someone without battle power.

Seeing Tuoba Chengan lying on the ground angrily yet powerlessly, pounding the ground with his hands, Chu Feng let out a sneer. Then, he turned his gaze to those monstrous beasts and spoke loudly, “His cultivation has been crippled.”

“Don’t you all want revenge? Don’t you all have grievances? Stop standing there, it’s time to settle them.”

Chu Feng did not plan to finish Tuoba Chengan himself. Rather, he wanted those monstrous beasts to torture him.

Those monstrous beasts had sharp hands. They were even able to excavate those rocks. Just thinking about the sight of those sharp hands landing on Tuoba Chengan’s body made Chu Feng feel enormously refreshed.

Chu Feng felt that having those monstrous beasts end Tuoba Chengan’s life would be the greatest punishment for him.

Actually, before Chu Feng had even called them to act, those monstrous beasts had already walked over and were staring fiercely at Tuoba Chengan lying on the ground.

Their deep resentment could be seen in their eyes.

It was simply that they didn’t dare to do anything. They were still worried.

Chu Feng was able to guess what they were worried about.

“Rest assured, the All-heaven Sect has already been wiped out. He’s nothing more than a stray dog now.”

“Once you all kill him today, you will be able to regain your lost freedom. It will be up to you whether you want to stay here to become the masters of this place, or leave. No one will cause trouble for you all again.”

“Oh, that’s right. It’s fine to attack him with the intention of killing him. However, remember to leave his source energy for me,” said Chu Feng.

“Roar~~~”

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, those monstrous beasts finally began attacking.

They immediately surrounded Tuoba Chengan.

Countless sharp claws pierced into him.

Those monstrous beasts that were tortured for so long began to frantically retaliate against Tuoba Chengan.

Under such ravagement, Tuoba Chengan screamed nonstop. Although he was screaming, he was actually able to clench his teeth to curse Chu Feng out.

“Asura! You treacherous bastard! You’ll die miserably! You will definitely die a miserable death!”

“Even if I, Tuoba Chengan, am to become a ghost... I... I will not let you get away!”

His curses did not last for long, as those monstrous beasts soon killed him.

After Tuoba Chengan was killed, those monstrous beasts moved neatly to either side.

Furthermore, they all got on their knees.

“Milord, thank you for rescuing us! We Underground Iron Beasts will forever remember your grace!”

Thunderous voices began to sound.

It turned out that those monstrous beasts were not only intelligent, but they were also capable of speech.

The reason they were thanking Chu Feng was not only because he’d helped them get rid of Tuoba Chengan.

It was also because he had used his spirit formation to stop the whips above them and had sealed off the grand refinement formation the moment he appeared.

Because of that, he had saved many of their clansmen from being refined to death by the spirit formation.

They had observed all of Chu Feng’s actions.

“There’s no need to thank me. He and I were enemies to begin with.”

“Even if you all had decided to spare him, I wouldn’t have spared him myself.”

“Merely, why did you all end his life so quickly?”

“Aren’t you letting that old bastard off too easily by killing him so quickly?”

Chu Feng looked to Tuoba Chengan on the ground.

Tuoba Chengan no longer resembled a human after being torn apart by countless sharp claws.

It could be said that he had suffered a cruel death.

But, Chu Feng still felt that he’d let off that old bastard too easily by killing him like that.

If he had known that those monstrous beasts would only torture Tuoba Chengan for such a short time, Chu Feng would’ve done it personally.
