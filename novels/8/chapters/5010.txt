Chapter 5010: Dirty Father and Son

Chu Feng quickly picked up the bowl of Dragon Spring and took a small sip.

As soon as the Dragon Spring flowed into his mouth, he realized why cultivators would go to the extent of offering Exalted Armaments for a mere consumable. While it wasn’t of much help to one’s cultivation, the Dragon Spring had an invigorating effect that left one feeling cleansed.

Even Chu Feng’s anger had died down the moment he ingested the Dragon Spring. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He took another two more mouthfuls, and a wave of comfort and relaxation washed over his body. It had been a long time since he had felt this way. Even his troubles seemed to vanish at this very moment.

“Father, look! The Dragon Spring looks tasty!”

Chu Feng was immersing himself in the sensations washing over his body when he was suddenly dragged back into the present by a boyish voice. He glanced over and saw two individuals walking into the premises.

It was a middle-aged man and a little boy.

The middle-aged man had a burly appearance, especially with the stubble he had on his face. He wore clothes that made one wonder if he had picked up a random rucksack off the street and fastened it around himself with a piece of rope to serve as makeshift clothes. He also wasn’t wearing any shoes, revealing a pair of pitch-black feet stained with grime.

He carried an ax behind him that didn’t look like a weapon at all, let alone an Exalted Armament. It looked like an ordinary ax intended for chopping wood.

The little boy that was with him appeared ot be around ten years of age, and he was covered in dirt too. He could hardly be said to be good looking, but his innocent eyes and honest appearance made him rather adorable.

“Ahem! That young hero over there… Erm, I have a request to make. Could you let my son have a taste of the Dragon Spring? Just a bit would do. It’ll be perfectly fine if you’re unwilling too. I know that it’s a brash request for me to make all of a sudden,” the middle-aged man asked Chu Feng in embarrassment.

He even dared not to look straight at Chu Feng, as if fearing the latter would berate him.

Chu Feng could tell that the middle-aged man wasn’t a thick-skinned person, but he still bore with the shame and made this inappropriate request for the sake of his son. It reminded him of his own father and godfather.

So, he formed a bowl using his spirit power, intending to share some of his Dragon Spring with the little boy.

Shoosh!

A hand suddenly swiped in and snatched Chu Feng’s bowl of Dragon Spring over. It was the Netherworld Envoy.

“Those who fail to prepare aren’t qualified to taste the Dragon Spring. To even consider offering the Dragon Spring to a person like that, Chu Feng, you have also lost your rights to enjoy the Dragon Spring,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

Without any hesitation, he downed Chu Feng’s bowl of Dragon Spring.

“Heh… Feigning a good person? Look at where it landed you. You even lost your own portion. Have some self-awareness!”

The pale-faced man from the Heavenwind Sword Sect must have been keeping an eye on Chu Feng all this while, for he let out a sneer right away.

Feeling conscience-stricken, the middle-aged man apologized, “My apologies, young hero. I’ve implicated you.”

“I’m sorry, big brother.”

Even the little boy also obediently apologized to Chu Feng.

“This has nothing to do with you. If you really wish to have a taste of the Dragon Spring, I’ll think of a solution. Give me a moment,” Chu Feng said.

Upon hearing those words, the pale-faced man from the Heavenwind Sword Sect didn’t hesitate to mock him, “You’ll think of a solution? Are you going to learn from that old man and trade your Exalted Armament for Dragon Spring Coins? Or are you going to be thick-skinned like those two poor things and beg others?”

Chu Feng couldn’t be bothered to waste his time bickering with that man. He rose to his feet and walked toward the crowd from the Heavenwind Sword Sect.

The crowd thought that Chu Feng was going to cause trouble, so they eyed him with hostile faces. Some of them even reached for their swords.

“This young lady over here, do you have extra Dragon Spring Coins?”

Unexpectedly, Chu Feng ignored that pale-faced man and instead approached the valiant lady.

“I do, but I have no intention of trading it with you. I agree with your elder. Those who have come unprepared aren’t qualified to enjoy the Dragon Spring,” the lady replied.

“I’d like to propose a bet,” Chu Feng said.

“I don’t bet with others.”

The lady turned her head away, indicating her reluctance to continue speaking with Chu Feng. She hadn’t thought that Chu Feng would propose a bet, and she abhorred such practices. Due to that, her tone even sounded a little annoyed.

“I’d like to make a bet with you that I’m able to decipher this True Dragon Chessboard,” Chu Feng said.

“What did you say?”

The woman looked at Chu Feng in bewilderment, not expecting the bet proposed by Chu Feng to be related to the True Dragon Chessboard.

“If I’m able to decipher this True Dragon Chessboard, all you have to do is to give me twenty Dragon Spring Coins,” Chu Feng replied.

“Whether you’re able to decipher the True Dragon Chessboard or not has nothing to do with me. I have no reason to make this bet with you.”

The woman was intrigued, but she chose to turn down Chu Feng’s proposal.

“Brat, are you really going to bet on that?”

However, it piqued the pale-faced man’s interest.

“Do you have Dragon Spring Coins?” Chu Feng asked.

“I have plenty of that,” the pale-faced man boasted.

He reached into his Cosmos Sack and took out twenty Dragon Spring Coins.

“If you’re really able to decipher the True Dragon Chessboard, I’ll give all of this to you. However, if you aren’t able to do so, you’ll have to sever your own tongue. What do you say?” the pale-faced man asked.

“Very well, let’s go with that. Everyone here shall bear witness to our bet, so I hope that you won’t renege on your promise,” Chu Feng said.

“I, Li Han, do not break my promise. Rather, I’m more concerned that you won’t hold the end of your promise,” the pale-faced man said.

“Li Han?”

“He’s Li Han?”

“Isn’t that the name of the number one junior of the Heavenwind Sword Sect?”

Some discussion broke out in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber after the pale-faced man gave out his name. Li Han revealed a look of glee upon seeing how well-known his name was, and that made him even more confident.

“Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you getting afraid now? I can’t blame you for that. How could someone of your caliber possibly be able to decipher the True Dragon Chessboard?” Li Han scoffed.

“Haven’t I already accepted your bet? I am not one to back down from a bet. Please make way. I’m going to decipher the chessboard right now.”

Chu Feng walked right past the juniors of the Heavenwind Sword Sect, who looked at him with contemptuous eyes. None of the juniors of the Heavenwind Sword Sect believed that Chu Feng was capable of deciphering the True Dragon Chessboard. They were just waiting for Chu Feng to make a fool of himself.

The others in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber began paying attention to the commotion, including the waiter. Of course, none of them had much confidence in Chu Feng either.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Chu Feng began to move the True Dragon Chessboard. Within moments, the vague silhouette of a dragon started to show through the seemingly nonsensical painting. With each rearrangement, the dragon grew clearer and clearer.

It didn’t take long for the painting to be completed, revealing a majestic dragon.

“It has been deciphered! He was able to do it in such a short period of time!”

Exclamations of incredulity echoed throughout the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber. The crowd was baffled by what they had just witnessed.

“Impossible! How could you have possibly deciphered the True Dragon Chessboard? You must be resorting to trickery!”

However, Li Han refused to acknowledge that Chu Feng had really deciphered the True Dragon Chessboard. He insisted that Chu Feng was resorting to trickery.

“Trickery? He’d be really despicable if that’s the case.”

“Someone like that ought to be punished!”

Li Han’s words won the approval of the crowd. Many of them thought that if the True Dragon Chessboard were to be solved one day, it would be in the hands of a formidable cultivator. However, Chu Feng clearly didn’t fit the criteria.

In the first place, it didn’t make sense for a nobody to be able to decipher the chessboard so easily when so many experts had failed before him. That lent credence to Li Han’s assertion that Chu Feng had used some kind of trick here.

Awooo!

A dragon’s howl suddenly echoed from the True Dragon Chessboard, and the majestic dragon soared out of the painting. It first circled around Chu Feng before turning into a whiff of smoke that converged at Chu Feng’s hand.

When the smoke finally dissipated, the crowd saw a token sitting on Chu Feng’s hand. It was clear with a glance that the token was no ordinary object.

“Trickery? Why don’t you have a good look at my token and tell me whether it’s trickery or not?” Chu Feng asked Li Han with a sneer.
