MGA: Chapter 1517 - Boasting, Lying

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~~”

Right at this moment, Xian Kun’s hands began to transform once again. He was unleashing another attack. Furthermore, he was using the same martial skill as before, the martial skill that he had created, that imitation of the Yan Clan’s Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique.

However, this time around, Xian Kun was even more fluent in unleashing this martial skill. Furthermore, it could be said to have reached perfection. Earlier, it was only that of a rank nine martial skill. However, this time around, Xian Kun’s martial skill was infinitely close to becoming a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill.

When they saw this scene, Yan Lei and Yan Ru looked to one another. Both of their gazes became grave and serious. Within their grave and serious expressions was a deep sense of lingering fear.

Fortunately, Yan Lei had discovered the change in Xian Kun and immediately retrieved the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique stopping him from continuing to comprehend it.

Otherwise, what Xian Kun would be using right now might not be merely a self-created imitation of the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique. Instead, it might be the Flame Sea Technique itself.

This Xian Kun’s comprehension ability caused Yan Lei and Yan Ru to feel greatly inferior.

“I shall see how you will dodge it this time around.”

After Xian Kun’s martial skill was completed, he immediately unleashed it toward Chu Feng. The ferocious flames turned into a column of flame as it shot explosively toward Chu Feng.

Its speed was extremely fast, so fast that it was like a ray of light. In merely the blink of an eye, it arrived before Chu Feng. With enormous heat, Xian Kun’s martial skill was planning to refine Chu Feng alive.

Sure enough, Xian Kun’s second usage of his martial skill had managed to increase its might by a lot. It was as Yan Lei and Yan Ru suspected, Xian Kun’s martial skill was already infinitely close to becoming a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill.

“Boom~~~”

However, right at the moment when the column of flame was about to reach Chu Feng and swallow him to start refining him, Chu Feng’s body trembled slightly. Soon after that, a boundless amount of raging flames began to emit from his body like a volcanic eruption.

Those raging flames were truly too ferocious. As they surged nonstop, they possessed the power to topple mountains and overturn seas. Truly, they shocked everybody’s focused gazes and caused their hearts to tremble.

Before Chu Feng’s blazing flames, Xian Kun’s column of flame was practically insignificant. The difference between their sizes was akin to the difference between an ant and an elephant.

The flame that Chu Feng unleashed instantly swallowed up Xian Kun’s column of flame. Furthermore, it was still spreading with a frightening speed. In merely an instant, Chu Feng’s flame had sealed off this entire sky. Even Xian Kun had been swallowed up by Chu Feng’s flames.

At this moment, what was above the heads of the crowd were no longer white clouds. Instead, it was a sea of boundlessly surging flames.

......

When Yan Lei and Yan Ru saw the sea of flames that covered the sky, they were both stunned with trembling mouths.

In fact, even Yan Xie, who was always calm, had slightly opened his mouth as boundless shock emerged in his eyes.

“That is, our Yan Clan’s martial skill that we do not teach outsiders, the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique!!!”

Yan Lei suddenly spoke. Once those words left Yan Lei’s mouth, the rest of the people in the crowd were all shocked too.

“What? It’s the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique? Isn’t that the Yan Clan’s martial skill that they do not teach others? How does Chu Feng know it?”

“Could it be that, when Yan Lei was allowing everyone to see it earlier, Chu Feng he... Heavens.... If that’s truly the case, that Chu Feng’s comprehension ability is truly too frightening. This is not real, this is definitely not real! It must be something else!”

When the crowd thought about this, they no longer dared to continue thinking anymore. Two hours, it was a time in which they did not even manage to comprehend the method of cultivation for the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique. Yet, not only did Chu Feng manage to comprehend it, he had even managed to successfully learn the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique. This was truly too shocking for them to even think about.

Was this something that a human could even accomplish? It was most definitely not something that ordinary people could accomplish. It would be impossible for even geniuses. That was because everyone present could be considered to be geniuses. Yet, none of them had managed to accomplish that feat.

“Ahhh~~~~~~”

At the moment when the crowd was entirely astonished, a loud shout was suddenly heard from that sea of flames. It was Xian Kun’s voice.

At the moment that loud shout was heard, a vortex of flame suddenly appeared in the sea of flames that covered the sky.

That vortex possessed a frightening amount of attractive power, and was swallowing up the sea of flames that filled the sky.

That attractive power was too strong. The flowers and grass of the garden were being uprooted and sucked into the sky. Even the buildings in the garden began to shatter one after another and were then pulled into that vortex.

Even the geniuses who were present on the ground were able to realize how frightening that attractive power was. Fortunately, they were quite some distance away from that sea of flames and everyone possessed a very high and profound cultivation. Otherwise, this attractive power would have most definitely sucked many of the people present into that sea of flames.

In this sort of frightening attractive power, the sea of flames that covered the sky was soon completely sucked dry by that vortex.

At the moment when the final bits of flames were sucked into that vortex, Xian Kun and a green and oval-shaped gate appeared before everyone’s line of sight.

The gate overlapped Xian Kun. It could be said that that gate was being emitted from Xian Kun’s body. It was very large, several tens of meters tall. As it slowly rotated, it gave the crowd a sort of boundless sensation.

It was as if that was not a gate, but rather an abyss, a gigantic mouth that could devour everything.

Nothing would be able to satisfy the hunger of that gate. As long as they were sucked into it, they would definitely be killed.

That had to be an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to display such powerful might. However, it did not look like an ordinary Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. That was because it stood out from all the other Earthen Taboo Martial Skills. Even its aura was very different. Yet, that aura was similar to the Ancient Era’s Elves. It was evident that this was a martial skill that was characteristic to the Ancient Era’s Elves.

An Earthen Taboo Martial Skill of the Ancient Era’s Elves. Naturally, it would be extremely frightening. That was because it could be said to be a technique from the Ancient Era.

“Brother Yan Lei, if I am not mistaken, what Chu Feng used earlier should be your Yan Clans’ Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique, right?”

“Your Yan Clan’s relationship with the Cyanwood Mountain is truly extraordinary. You actually even taught a Cyanwood Mountain’s disciple what you said was something that your Yan Clan did not teach outsiders.”

“However, I merely wish to see it. Yet, you refused to even allow me to do that. Haha... is there truly a need for such an enormous gap between how you conduct yourself?” In a very eccentric manner, Xian Kun spoke to Yan Lei. He was sowing dissension among the crowd.

All of the people present were Yan Lei’s friends. However, Yan Lei had only showed that Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique to the crowd for a short two hours before taking it away.

Actually, this could not be said to be anything. After all, what Yan Lei had done was extremely normal, as that Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique was their Yan Clan’s martial skill that they would not teach outsiders.

However, if this Martial Skill had already been taught to an outsider, then Yan Lei treating his friends in such a manner would be extremely insincere, extremely narrow-minded.

“Our Yan Clan has never taught this martial skill to the Cyanwood Mountain, much less taught it to Chu Feng,” Yan Lei flat-out denied.

“You still refuse to admit it? That Chu Feng just used it. We have all seen it with our eyes. Do you take us all to be blind?” Xian Kun asked coldly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Right at this moment, Chu Feng said, “Not only are you blind, you’re also stupid.”

“What did you say? You dare insult me?” Hearing Chu Feng’s words, Xian Kun was enraged.

“I’m not insulting you. I am merely speaking the truth,” As Chu Feng spoke, he looked to Yan Lei, “Brother Yan Lei, thank you very much for lending this Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique for me to learn earlier. Sure enough, this martial skill is very outstanding.”

“What?”

“Earlier?”

Once Chu Feng’s words left his mouth, the crowd were all shocked. If they were guessing before, then Chu Feng had affirmed their guesses. Chu Feng declared that he had successfully learned the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique in the short two hours earlier.

“You are truly arrogant! What did you say? What do you mean by that? Are you trying to say that you managed to comprehend the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique’s cultivation method in those short two hours and managed to successfully learn it?” Xian Kun asked with a forcibly questioning tone.

“Precisely,” Chu Feng answered.

“Who do you think you can deceive? You said you learned the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique in only two hours’ time, do you take us for fools?” Xian Kun simply did not believe Chu Feng’s words.

That was because even he had been unable to comprehend the complete cultivation method for the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique. Thus, how could Chu Feng possibly be able to comprehend it?

To not only comprehend the cultivation method, but also successfully learn it, to Xian Kun, this was simply impossible. Thus, he felt that Chu Feng was boasting, he had to be lying.
