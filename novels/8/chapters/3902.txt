Chapter 3902 - Don’t Forget About Your Daddy I

“Gou Za, what sort of trouble did you court?”

Gou Za’s grandmother also grew anxious. She had a look of anger and, even more, worry on her face.

“Grandmother, it’s alright. It’s really alright this time around.”

“Milord, please wait for me here. I’ll return right away.”

Although Gou Za knew of Chu Feng’s cultivation, he did not have any intention to ask him to solve this problem for him. Instead, he directly ran outside.

“Big brother Gou Zhen, coming, I’m coming.”

Like a grandson, Gou Za ran over to those people.

The big brother Gou Zhen he spoke of was that rank eight Heavenly Immortal fellow.

“Gou Za, where’s the thing that you’ve borrowed?” asked Gou Zhen.

“Big brother Gou Zhen, it’s here with me. I’ve not lost it. I’ve been taking proper care of it.”

As Gou Za spoke, he took out an axe and a hammer.

Chu Feng had seen both the axe and the hammer before.

Those were the tools that Gou Za and the others had used to smash the bones of the Heaven-reaching Giant Spirit Beasts back in the cave.

Chu Feng had noticed their tools to be quite special back then.

After all, even though those Heaven-reaching Giant Spirit Beasts had died, their bones were still extremely hard. Ordinary Heavenly Immortals couldn’t possibly break them.

Not to mention Heavenly Immortals, breaking those bones would be very strenuous for even Martial Immortals.

The reason why Gou Za and the others had been able to shatter the bones was all because of those tools.

Chu Feng had thought those tools to be rather remarkable back then. It turned out, that Gou Za had borrowed them.

Gou Zhen took the tools and put them away. Then, he asked, “Where’s the source energies?”

“Big brother Gou Zhen, I’ve already prepared all of them for you,” As Gou Za spoke, he took out a pot-like vessel. That was the vessel that he had been cautiously collecting the source energies in earlier.

“Why is there so little? Are you fucking with me?”

After accepting the vessel, Gou Zhen grew furious. He raised his leg and directly kicked Gou Za to the ground.

“Big brother Gou Zhen, there are too many people scrambling for the source energies. I truly tried my best. I didn’t keep anything. Those are all the source energies I managed to excavate,” Gou Za said with a look of being wronged as he lay on the ground.

“When I lent you the tools, I told you that you’d have to gather a full pot as payment.”

“As for the rest, regardless of how little or how much, you could keep them all for yourself. That was our agreement.”

“However, you’ve failed to bring back a full pot, failed to pay your payment. I do not care if you kept anything for yourself. Since the payment’s not enough, you’ll have to compensate me,” said that Gou Zhen.

“But big brother Gou Zhen, that’s a whole pot there. I’ve gathered a whole pot for you,” said Gou Za.

“This, a whole pot? Nonsense! This is what I mean by a whole pot!”

As that Gou Zhen spoke, he took out another vessel from behind him.

However, that vessel was ten times the size of the vessel Gou Za had given him.

“Big brother Gou Zhen, you never said the pot had to be that big. Besides, when you told me to fill up a pot, that was the pot you gave me. I thought you wanted me to fill up that pot.”

Gou Za was completely dumbstruck. At that moment, he realized that he had been played.

“Motherfucker! You’re blaming me for your own lack of comprehension?!”

“Men! Strip him of all the treasures he has on him. If there’s not enough, beat him up, beat him to death!”

As that Gou Zhen spoke, he unleashed his oppressive might and suppressed Gou Za to the ground.

Following that, his lackeys ran up toward Gou Za and began to search him.

By that time, Chu Feng had already stood up. He felt that he could not look on without doing anything.

Although he had only just met Gou Za, he felt that he was pitiful. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Besides, Gou Za was clearly able to continue hunting for more source energies, but had decided to guide Chu Feng of his own accord.

Although Gou Za had done so because he had selfish motives in hoping that Chu Feng would pretend to be his friend so that his grandmother could be happy, Chu Feng was able to understand his selfish motive.

Of course, most important of all was the fact that Gou Zhen was simply too excessive. His behavior was completely unreasonable. He was trying to exploit Gou Za through a scam. Who knew how many other people besides Gou Za had been deceived by that Gou Zhen?

Gou Zhen and his lackeys were simply scum of the Ancient Era’s organisms.

“Woosh~~~”

However, right when Chu Feng was planning to act, right when he was planning to walk out, a strong gale swept past him.

It was Gou Za’s grandmother. Gou Za’s grandmother was also a cultivator. Merely, her cultivation was inferior to Gou Za. She was merely a rank three Heavenly Immortal.

At that moment, she had unleashed her fastest ability and arrived before Gou Za.

“Milords, please don’t beat up Gou Za. Please don’t beat up Gou Za.”

“He owes you money, right? I’ll pay for him, I’ll pay for him.”

Gou Za’s grandmother pushed aside the people around Gou Za and then directly covered him with her body. She was deeply afraid that they would beat up Gou Za.

“You damned dying old fart, what could you possibly have that could replace precious cultivation resources?” Gou Zhen asked with a look of contempt.

“Milord, I possess an Ancient Era’s secret skill. This secret skill is extremely precious, and not something source energy could compare to. Milord, please have a look.”

As Gou Za’s grandmother spoke, she carefully took out a piece of paper from her chest pocket and handed it to Gou Zhen.

Although Gou Zhen had a look of contempt on his face, he still accepted the paper. After receiving the paper, his expression changed enormously. Then, he tore the paper to pieces and tossed it at Gou Za’s grandmother’s face.

“You damned dying old shit, you dare to toy with me?! Men! Beat them up! Beat up both this old shit and that little shit!” shouted that Gou Zhen.

Once Gou Zhen gave the command, his lackeys immediately got moving. They were really planning to beat up both Gou Za and his grandmother. They were not even planning to spare the elderly.

“Bang~~~”

However, right when those people were about to start beating them up, an enormous energy ripple swept forth. The energy ripple turned into a strong wind that blew all those people away.

“Gou Za, have you gone mad?! You dare resist your daddy?!”

Gou Zhen looked to Gou Za with a look of fury.

It was Gou Za who had unleashed that strong wind.

Gou Za did not resist when he himself was going to be beaten up.

However, he was ultimately unable to contain himself when his grandmother was confronted with a beating.

“Big brother Gou Zhen, if you want to beat me up, go ahead and beat me up. But please spare my grandmother,” Gou Za said as he hugged his grandmother.

“Gou Za, you have some backbone boy.”

“How about this, I’ll give you a chance. Follow me, and I will consider your debt written off. Furthermore, from today, I will allow you and your grandmother to live well, like kings in the Dog Nation,” said Gou Zhen.

“Heh...”

Hearing those words, Gou Za suddenly laughed.

“How could one possibly live well in the Dog Nation?”

With a wry smile, Gou Za shook his head. He then said, “Big brother Gou Zhen, I’m afraid I cannot comply with that. I, Gou Za, will not follow you.”

“Motherfucker! You’re truly one to refuse the face that is given to you! Since that’s the case, I cannot keep you. I must teach you a proper lesson!”

As Gou Zhen spoke, killing intent appeared in his eyes. He not only planned to teach Gou Za a lesson. Instead, he was planning to kill him.

“Ahem.”

Right at that moment, a cough exploded like thunder.

The sudden explosive sound startled everyone. Many people were so afraid that their bodies trembled.

Even Gou Zhen, who was planning to attack Gou Za, stayed his hand.

The crowd were unable to understand whose cough could be so resounding.

Most importantly, that cough seemed to sound from Gou Za’s tent.

“Gou Za, you’re truly too insincere. Confronted with this sort of thing, you’ve actually forgotten about your daddy I ?”

Right when the crowd were all confused, a figure walked out from the tent.

That person was none other than Chu Feng.
