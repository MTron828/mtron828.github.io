Chapter 2479 - Paying The Price

At that moment, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief no longer possessed the threatening attitude he’d had when he arrived.

The current Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked like someone who was about to die. He was half-kneeling in midair, shivering, with his head lowered. His mood was exceptionally downcast.

Although those who were killed earlier were not everyone from the Ying Heavenly Clan, they were all the Ying Heavenly Clan’s elites.

With those people killed, it was no different from exterminating the entire Ying Heavenly Clan.

Thus, at that moment, his heart had crumbled.

“Clank~~~”

Suddenly, the sound of a weapon piercing through the air could be heard in the vast sky.

Chu Feng was holding the Magma Emperor Sword in his hand.

Stepping on air, Chu Feng began to walk toward the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief one step at a time.

After killing all those people, Chu Feng would naturally not spare the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

After all, he was the cause of the battle.

“It seems that you’ve already made preparations to die.”

“Originally, you didn’t have to die, and your clansmen also didn’t have to die. However, because of your mistaken decision of insisting on avenging your evil son, you’ve brought about your deaths.”

Chu Feng had arrived before the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. The Magma Emperor Sword he held in his hand was aimed at the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s dantian.

“Chu Feng, I admit that you’ve won today.”

“However, what of it?”

“Even though you’ve defeated me, you’re still going to lose to others. You will lose even more thoroughly than me,” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief stated.

“What do you mean by that?” Chu Feng frowned as he asked coldly. He had managed to determine something from those words.

“Haha...” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief let out a sinister laugh.

Then, he slowly raised his head and looked to Chu Feng, “While you’ve saved the Three Stars Hall, are you able to save the Sunset Cloud Valley?”

“The one who is attacking the Sunset Cloud Valley is the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Luxuan.”

“You said that Chu Luxuan is attacking the Sunset Cloud Valley?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed instantly.

After all, the Sunset Cloud Valley was also a power that he was deeply concerned for. Never did he expect what he had worried about the most to happen.

Chu Luxuan actually really attacked the Sunset Cloud Valley.

“We left at the same time. If my calculations are not mistaken, the Sunset Cloud Valley should’ve already been eliminated several days ago.”

“Not mentioning whether or not you will be a match for Chu Luxuan, even if you are to rush over there now, all that you will see are ruins and corpses.”

“Furthermore, it is not only the Sunset Cloud Valley that is being exterminated, that Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong are your friends, no?” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“What had happened to them?” Chu Feng asked worriedly.

“They have already been captured by the lord from the Chu Heavenly Clan. I presume that they should be dead by now,” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Impossible! How could someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan be able to capture the two of them?” Chu Feng did not believe the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. However, he was still extremely worried.

He felt that Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were extremely cautious individuals. Even if Chu Luxuan wanted to kill them, it would not be that easy for him to do so. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yet, they were actually captured?

However, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not seem to be joking around. As such, Chu Feng was very worried.

“Do you think I’m deceiving you? I’m already someone who’s going to die soon, why would I do such a foolish thing?”

“As for the person that captured them, it would naturally not be a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation. Instead, the person who captured them is an extremely powerful lord, someone no one in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm can contend against,” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief declared.

“That is even more impossible. The Chu Heavenly Clansmen are not allowed to concern themselves in the matters of their younger generation. How could that individual attack Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong?” Chu Feng said.

“How the hell would I know about something like that? However, I am certain of one thing. That is, your two friends have been captured, and are most likely dead by now.”

“However, you don’t have to be so anxious either. After all, that lord will soon come and capture you too. Soon, you will be able to reunite with your friends.”

“Merely, at the time that you all reunite with one another, it will no longer be in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Instead, it will be in the underworld.”

“Of course, I will also wait for you there,” As the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke those words, a strange smile emerged on his ashen face.

“Puu~~~”

Right at that moment, the sword in Chu Feng’s hand was pierced into the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s dantian.

“You!!!” Even though he was already prepared to be killed, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief still revealed a painful expression when his dantian was actually pierced through by Chu Feng’s sword.

“You can go and wait for me down there. However, you will definitely not be able to see me. After all, I do not plan to go down there.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng flipped his wrist, and the Magma Emperor Sword unleashed boundless power.

“Bang!” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief exploded into pieces. He had been utterly killed.

Witnessing that scene, the crowd from the Three Stars Hall all shivered in their hearts.

Chu Feng was extremely decisive in killing. It was something that many people were unable to learn.

However, at the same time that they felt Chu Feng’s ruthlessness, they were actually feeling very relieved.

They knew very well that Chu Feng was an extremely ruthless individual.

Chu Feng’s ruthlessness caused them to feel fear toward Chu Feng. However, no one felt disgusted with Chu Feng.

After all, all the people that Chu Feng had killed were their enemies, people who wanted to kill them.

Thus, even though Chu Feng had killed those people, the people from the Three Stars Hall did not blame Chu Feng. Instead, they felt grateful toward Chu Feng.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and layers of spirit power flowed out from him. They turned into golden rays that filled the sky. Like raindrops, they sprinkled down from the sky, landing on everyone’s bodies.

Upon being enveloped by the golden raindrops, the injured people from the Three Stars Hall all recovered instantly.

Not only did all the pain they felt wash away, but they also felt much more spirited. It was like they had never been injured, and had instead taken special medicinal pellets.

“What a powerful world spirit technique.”

At that moment, many people let out voices of wonder.

Actually, to world spiritists, healing injuries was a simple matter.

However, they generally would only heal one or two individuals at a time. For something like what Chu Feng had just done where he healed everyone from the Three Stars Hall with a wave of his sleeve, it was not something that ordinary world spiritists could accomplish.

“This Immortal-cloak Spirit Power, little friend Chu Feng, you’re already a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist now?”

The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster revealed a marvelous expression. He had managed to tell that Chu Feng’s spirit power was that of a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?”

Upon hearing what the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster said, everyone revealed astonished expressions. They began to look to Chu Feng with even greater admiration.

In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, there were much fewer Immortal-cloak World Spiritists than peak Martial Ancestors. As for Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, their numbers were even fewer.

If Chu Feng had already astonished the crowd with his cultivation, then his world spirit techniques came as an even greater astonishment than his cultivation.

However, although he was faced with gazes of admiration, Chu Feng had a serious look on his face as he looked to the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster.

“Senior, you’ve also heard it. The Sunset Cloud Valley is in danger. I cannot ignore this.”

“Thus, this Chu Feng will take his leave today. If the opportunity presents itself again in the future, I will definitely come visit senior again,” Chu Feng said to the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster.

“Go on ahead. There is a teleportation formation to the east. Using it, you will be able to reach the Sunset Cloud Valley sooner. Merely, little friend Chu Feng, you must be careful,” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster said.

“Senior, farewell,” Chu Feng clasped his fist. As his voice landed, he had already disappeared.

Chu Feng had left for the Sunset Cloud Valley.

He was uncertain whether or not what the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had said was true.

However, what he could be certain of was that if something were to happen to the Sunset Cloud Valley, if something were to happen to Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, then he, Chu Feng, would definitely make those people pay regardless of who they might be!!!
