Chapter 3251 - Wuma Shengjie

At that moment, Chu Feng’s expression also became serious.

His opponent should’ve already discovered that he was a rank two Martial Immortal.

However, his opponent was still acting so arrogant, and did not place Chu Feng in his eyes.

This could only mean one thing. That is, his opponent’s strength was very likely stronger than his own.

At the very least, Chu Feng’s opponent would not be weaker than him.

“Wuma Shengjie, was it?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng had heard the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Wuma Shengjie being mentioned repeatedly while he was traveling to the New Excellence Grand Assembly.

Originally, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm were in the same sort of situation as the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

It was Wuma Shengjie who, by himself, defeated numerous opponents, and even brought the Wuma Heavenly Clan into the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region.

The Wuma Heavenly Clansmen that had surrounded Chu Feng earlier, although imposing, were overall very weak. Even though they were stronger than the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they were not that much stronger.

From this, it could be seen that the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm were generally quite weak.

However, even though Chu Feng had revealed his strength, the person inside the palace still did not place Chu Feng in his eyes.

Chu Feng deduced that there was only a single person among the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen that possessed that sort of confidence. As for that person, he was that rumored exceptional genius, Wuma Shengjie.

“Since you’ve heard about me, shouldn’t you back out right now as to avoid defeat? It would appear that you’ve truly grown tired of living?”

The voice from the palace was heard again. At the same time, a figure slowly walked out from the palace.

That person was wearing the same sort of outfit as the other Wuma Heavenly Clansmen. Merely, he was wearing a hat over his head.

Although that hat was not at all worn out, it looked very worn out for some reason. Regardless, the hat was very ugly.

As for that person, his appearance was somewhat peculiar. It wasn’t that he was ugly. Rather, he gave off a very uncomfortable feeling.

His skin was yellow, beeswax yellow. It was as if he were suffering from malnutrition.

It would be one thing if that were all; however that man’s face was also covered in spots. It was like fly feces had covered his face.

In short, that man looked very dirty. Seeing him, one would feel uncomfortable.

“You are Wuma Shengjie?” Chu Feng asked.

Actually, even without asking, Chu Feng knew that the man before him must be the exceptional genius of the Wuma Heavenly Clan, Wuma Shengjie.

Merely, Chu Feng was still unable to keep himself from asking. As for the reason why, it was because that man was simply too different from the other exceptional geniuses Chu Feng had met in the past.

For the other geniuses Chu Feng had met before, even if they weren’t extraordinarily handsome, they still appeared very imposing and impressive. They gave off a sort of air that ordinary people simply did not possess.

However, the man before him was simply too ordinary. No, it would be elevating him to call him ordinary. He simply had no looks and no aura. In terms of being eccentric, he was nowhere comparable to Wang Qiang.

The reason for that was because even though Wang Qiang was eccentric, he was so eccentric that one would have no choice but to pay attention to him.

As for that Wuma Shengjie, there was simply nothing particular about him. If he were to be placed among a crowd, no one would bother to pay attention to him, and people would only distance themselves from him.

That said, there was one aspect about him that surprised Chu Feng.

Had it been someone else, they would definitely become angry from Chu Feng asking a question that he already knew the answer to. However, that Wuma Shengjie did not get angry.

He merely looked to Chu Feng and spoke indifferently, “I will give you this final chance. Scram immediately, and I won’t look further into you injuring my clansmen.”

After he finished saying those words, Wuma Shengjie turned around. It seemed like he had no intention to pay attention to Chu Feng.

“And what if I don’t?” Chu Feng asked.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Wuma Shengjie turned back again and looked to Chu Feng.

His sharp gaze was like two sharp swords intending to penetrate Chu Feng’s soul.

Most importantly, at the instant Wuma Shengjie turned around, his aura was completely unleashed. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Rank four Martial Immortal. That Wuma Shengjie was actually a rank four Martial Immortal.

This Wuma Shengjie’s cultivation was actually two entire levels above the renowned Linghu Mingye.

At that moment, even Chu Feng’s expression changed.

He finally realized why the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen all addressed Wuma Shengjie as an exceptional genius, and why they said that Wuma Shengjie was the strongest dark horse among all the geniuses.

Sure enough, this Wuma Shengjie possessed valiant strength.

Most importantly, Chu Feng felt that that Wuma Shengjie’s cultivation was most definitely not this high when he first entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

He had been progressing the entire time. Furthermore, the speed at which his cultivation increased was extremely fast. Should this continue, the Linghu Heavenly Clan would likely not be able to contend against him, and Wuma Shengjie would end up ruling the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

“Wuma Shengjie, your reputation is well justified.”

“However, my apologies, even if you are a rank four Martial Immortal, I will still not leave this place.”

As Chu Feng spoke, the Divine level Lightning Mark appeared on his forehead. Chu Feng’s cultivation increased from rank two Martial Immortal to rank three Martial Immortal.

At the same time, the Ancient Era’s War Axe and Ancient Era’s War Sword also appeared, and began to revolve around Chu Feng like divine artifacts, protecting him.

At that moment, Chu Feng was not only a rank three Martial Immortal, but he also gained a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a level of cultivation.

The current Chu Feng was capable of fighting against a rank four Martial Immortal.

Seeing Chu Feng’s various abilities, even the previously arrogant Wuma Shengjie revealed a change in expression.

Wuma Shengjie was staring at the Divine character on Chu Feng’s forehead. With an extremely surprised tone, he asked, “You’ve trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?”

However, before Chu Feng could reply, Wuma Shengjie spoke again, “No wonder you’re so confident. However, even so, you will still not be my match.”

“Woosh~~~”

After he finished saying those words, Wuma Shengjie’s body shifted. In the blink of an eye, he arrived before Chu Feng.

He did not use any Immortal Armaments, nor did he use any martial skills. Wuma Shengjie merely shot forth a punch explosively toward Chu Feng’s face.
