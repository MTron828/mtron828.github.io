Chapter 3394 - The Enraged Chu Feng

Although Linghu Mingye and the others had left, Tantai Xing’er and the bystanders remained.

Instead of leaving, they began to curiously inspect Chu Feng.

Tantai Xing’er even took the initiative to speak with Chu Feng with a smile on her face.

“Young master Chu Feng, are you the descendant of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s senior, Chu Xuanyuan?” Tantai Xing’er asked. Her attitude was very friendly, and did not possess any of the arrogance of an Ancestral Martial Decastar.

“I am. If I’m not mistaken, young lady should be the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Tantai Xing’er, right?” Chu Feng’s attitude was also very friendly.

Although he had had an unpleasant encounter with the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen earlier, Chu Feng was someone who would judge matters as they stood. Since Tantai Xing’er was friendly toward him, Chu Feng would naturally return her friendliness.

“Never would I have expected that young master Chu Feng would know of me. It is truly my honor,” Tantai Xing’er’s smile became even more brilliant. It was as if it was her honor to be known by Chu Feng.

“Miss Xing’er, while it is true that Chu Xuanyuan is very powerful, this Chu Feng... is simply too inferior when compared to his father. He’s not even a match for me. It’s simply impossible for him to match up to you. Miss Xing’er, you must not be deceived by him.”

Right at that moment, Tang Zhenghao, who had been standing to the side the entire time, suddenly stood forth.

He had an extremely pleased expression on his face when he declared that Chu Feng was no match for him. It was extremely obvious, what he was trying to imply.

He was trying to flaunt to Tantai Xing’er that he had won against Chu Feng before.

However, surprisingly, after Tang Zhenghao stood forth, Tantai Xing’er, whose face was smiling brilliantly, suddenly turned gloomy, “Young master Tang, I am currently talking with young master Chu Feng. Could you not cut into our conversation?”

Hearing those words, Tang Zhenghao was completely dumbfounded. Although he did not know Tantai Xing’er very well, it remained that he had met her several times, and had spoken with her before. In their previous conversations, her attitude was very friendly. Never did he expect that he would be scolded by her this time around.

But... even though he was not very familiar with Tantai Xing’er, it remained that they’d met several times. Thus, why would she be angry at him after just meeting Chu Feng?

This caused Tang Zhenghao to become furious. However, he was unable to unleash his fury at Tantai Xing’er. Thus, unsurprisingly, he turned his furious gaze toward Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, I’ve decided to occupy this place. Go and take a hike. Or do you want me to beat you out?”

“Boom~~~”

However, right after Tang Zhenghao’s words left his mouth, the rock walls of the cave started to tremble violently. A very powerful aura was wreaking havoc throughout the cave.

At that moment, the crowd all turned their eyes to Tantai Xing’er.

Even Wuma Shengjie began to look towards Tantai Xing’er with a serious expression.

The aura wreaking havoc throughout the surroundings was released by Tantai Xing’er.

Rank six Martial Immortal. That was Tantai Xing’er’s cultivation.

Such a powerful cultivation had completely astonished the crowd.

Tantai Xing’er was truly worthy of being the fourth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

She was truly worthy of her reputation; she was truly a genius.

At that moment, Tang Zhenghao started to panic.

His cultivation of rank eight Heavenly Immortal was simply akin to a stream encountering a river before Tantai Xing’er’s cultivation of rank six Martial Immortal. He was simply unable to contend against her in the slightest.

Furthermore, Tantai Xing’er was looking at Tang Zhenghao with a more and more unfriendly gaze.

“Young master Tang, if you continue to act so disrespectfully toward young master Chu Feng, don’t blame me for becoming impolite toward you,” Tantai Xing’er said coldly.

“Miss Tantai, you need not dirty your hands in taking care of such a rude fellow. It’s better that I handle such manual labor,” Chu Feng suddenly spoke.

“Motherfucker! You’re nothing but trash, yet you dare to say that sort of thing to me?! If I don’t teach you a lesson, you’ll forget about the suffering from being defeated by me that day!”

Tang Zhenghao shouted furiously. Then, his body shifted as he rapidly flew toward Chu Feng.

His speed was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived before Chu Feng.

Tang Zhenghao did not use any martial skills or any weapon. Instead, he merely made a fist with his hand and punched explosively at Chu Feng’s face.

“Bang.” A muffled sound was heard. The surrounding air seemed to have frozen. The bystanders were all staring at Chu Feng with their eyes wide open. A trace of confusion was present in their eyes.

Tang Zhenghao’s fist had clearly smashed into Chu Feng’s face.

But then, why was Chu Feng completely unharmed?

“Eeeahhh~~~” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Right at that moment, a heart-rending and lung-splitting scream sounded.

It was Tang Zhenghao. He grabbed the fist that he had attacked Chu Feng with and was screaming miserably as he backed away.

At that moment, the crowd discovered that the fist that Tang Zhenghao had attacked Chu Feng with was badly mangled and completely destroyed.

Unable to help themselves, the crowd turned to Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng’s face was not only completely uninjured, but there was also not a single bloodstain on his face.

At that moment, the crowd had a sudden premonition. ‘Tang Zhenghao’s fist did not manage to hit Chu Feng. Instead, it had been blocked by something.’

“Despicable bastard! You dare to use a treasure just because your cultivation is no match for me?! You are simply not qualified to be Chu Xuanyuan’s son! You are truly a disgrace to your father’s reputation!”

Tang Zhenghao pointed at Chu Feng and cursed explosively.

In Tang Zhenghao’s eyes, Chu Feng was simply no match for him. Thus... after he suffered at Chu Feng’s hands, the first possibility he could think of was that Chu Feng had used some sort of treasure against him.

“Wuuahh~~~”

Right at that moment, Tang Zhenghao screamed miserably again. At the same time, his entire body was shot flying, ruthlessly smashing into the rock wall.

At that moment, the crowd had no heart to concern themselves with Tang Zhenghao. Instead, their eyes were all focused on Chu Feng.

Even Tantai Xing’er was no exception.

At that moment, they were all able to clearly sense the aura emitted by Chu Feng.

It was precisely because they felt his aura that the crowd were so astonished.

They began to doubt if Tang Zhenghao had really managed to defeat Chu Feng in the past.

They also seemed to understand why Linghu Mingye and the others acted so afraid of Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng was simply too powerful, much more powerful than they had anticipated.

His cultivation was even an entire level higher than Tantai Xing’er’s.

He was... a rank seven Martial Immortal!!!

Not to mention the others, even Tang Zhenghao had an astonished look on his face. He simply did not dare to believe the scene before him.

Was the man before him still the same man that he had defeated back then in the Chu Heavenly Clan?

If he was the same man, how had he managed to make such overwhelming progress in such a short period of time?

“Tang Zhenghao, I’ve decided to occupy this place. Go and take a hike. Or do you want me to send you out?”

Chu Feng’s voice was suddenly heard.

When Tang Zhenghao saw Chu Feng’s eyes, his body started to tremble violently in an uncontrollable manner.

At that moment, not only was he able to sense Chu Feng’s overwhelming aura, but he was also able to feel the intense anger in Chu Feng’s eyes.

No, it was not only anger that was present in his eyes. There was also killing intent.

That killing intent was extremely terrifying. Never had Tang Zhenghao seen such killing intent from the eyes of a person of the younger generation.

Although he did not know what was going on, Tang Zhenghao realized that he seemed to have offended a very terrifying fellow by accident.
