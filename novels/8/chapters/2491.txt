Chapter 2491 - Determine Superiority

Upon seeing Young Master Li Ming, Chu Feng also started to closely examine him.

He discovered that he was actually unable to see through Young Master Li Ming’s cultivation.

That Young Master Li Ming was truly concealed with talent.

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng did not reveal the slightest panic. Instead, with a faint smile on his face, he asked, “You attacked my friend?”

“You mean that woman?” Young Master Li Ming asked.

“Naturally,” Chu Feng nodded.

“I have. What do you want to do about it?” Young Master Li Ming nodded.

“There was no hatred nor grievance between you two, why did you attack her?” Chu Feng asked.

“Must there be hatred or grievance in the world of martial cultivators for one to attack another?” Young Master Li Ming questioned instead of answering.

“True,” Chu Feng revealed a faint smile. Then, he asked, “Then, have you stopped me today because you want to attack me?”

“You’re quite smart. Let me mention this first. I do not possess any malice. I merely heard that you are very strong. Thus, I wish to have a spar to see if you’re as strong as you’re rumored to be.”

“However, you can also be reassured. While I defeat you, I will not injure you,” Young Master Li Ming waved the folding fan he held in his hand as he explained himself to Chu Feng. His words and attitude had revealed his absolute confidence.

“Unless you’re a True Immortal, I fear that it will be difficult for you to defeat me,” Chu Feng said.

“Is that so? Then, I will have to disappoint you.”

“Paa~~~”

As Young Master Li Ming spoke, he abruptly closed his folding fan. Then, with a quick step, he arrived before Chu Feng.

His palm extended forward, and a burst of wind shot forth. He had unleashed an attack toward Chu Feng.

“This guy!!!”

At that moment, Chu Feng was immediately startled.

There was not an overwhelming power to Young Master Li Ming’s palm strike. Even the burst of wind that it brought forth was extremely gentle.

However, when that wind landed on Chu Feng’s body, Chu Feng felt an enormous sense of oppression.

He... was actually being restricted.

He had been restricted by Young Master Li Ming’s oppressive might.

Not only did Young Master Li Ming possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, the same as Chu Feng, but he was also a rank nine Martial Ancestor.

“Woosh~~~”

In merely a blink of an eye, Young Master Li Ming’s palm arrived before Chu Feng. However, it stopped at a distance of a centimeter before Chu Feng’s face.

His palm did not land. It was not that he was unable to land his palm, but rather that he stopped himself right before landing it.

“You’ve lost,” Young Master Li Ming retrieved his palm and spoke to Chu Feng with a beaming smile and pride in his eyes.

After he finished saying those words, he suddenly turned around and soared into the sky. He was actually leaving.

“Chu Feng, chase after him. That guy mounted a sneak attack. This match doesn’t count,” Her Lady Queen said in a very unaccepting manner.

“Forget about it. Although I’ve lost due to carelessness, it remains that I have lost. I will not find a pretext for myself,” Compared to Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng was rather calm.

He did not feel humiliated because he had lost to Young Master Li Ming.

Through what happened earlier, Chu Feng was certain that this Young Master Li Ming was truly very powerful.

He had likely been concealing his actual strength when Chu Feng had met him at the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds. Although Chu Feng could not be certain that he had concealed his cultivation, he was certain that he had concealed his battle power.

At that time, the battle power Young Master Li Ming had revealed was only capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Yet presently, his battle power was capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.

Furthermore, he possessed the cultivation of a rank nine Martial Ancestor. Even if Chu Feng were to activate his Heavenly Bloodline’s Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, he would only be able to increase his cultivation to the same level as Young Master Li Ming’s.

As that Young Master Li Ming had concealed himself extremely deeply, Chu Feng had no idea what other abilities he might possess. Thus, even if Chu Feng were to go all-out, he still did not have absolute certainty in being able to defeat Young Master Li Ming.

Thus, Chu Feng did not feel humiliated to lose to someone like him.

More importantly, if Chu Feng did not accept defeat, and tried to continue to fight with Young Master Li Ming, it would instead make him appear to be petty.

Chu Feng was not that sort of person.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly felt an even stronger power enveloping him.

The next moment, Chu Feng felt his surroundings growing fuzzy. When everything returned to normal, he discovered that he was now at a different location than before.

Chu Feng had been to that place before. It was the same place where he had met the Golden Crane True Immortal before.

“Little friend Chu Feng, it’s been a long time since we last met, I trust that you have been well.”

Suddenly, a familiar voice sounded. It was the voice of the Golden Crane True Immortal.

However, the Golden Crane True Immortal did not reveal himself.

“Senior, I trust that you have also been well since we last met,” Chu Feng clasped his fist toward the direction of the voice.

“You have come to find me for the sake of that Wang Qiang, right?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.

“Senior, Wang Qiang is my brother. His injury is a danger to his life. Senior, I hope that you will be able to help him. As long as senior is willing to help, this Chu Feng will agree to any condition,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you really certain in agreeing to any condition?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.

“As long as it is something that this Chu Feng is capable of, as long as it is not an outrageous act or bloody atrocity, this Chu Feng will agree to anything,” Chu Feng said.

“While it might not be an outrageous act or bloody atrocity, it is something that you might not necessarily be capable of doing,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said profoundly.

Chu Feng did not hesitate. He said immediately, “Senior, please speak away.” He knew that this might be the only opportunity for him to ask the Golden Crane True Immortal to help Wang Qiang. Thus... he did not want to miss this opportunity.

“This matter might cause you to lose your life,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart moved slightly. He faintly felt that the situation might be bad.

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still said resolutely, “Senior, please tell me what it is.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I need you to help me retrieve an item. As long as you can retrieve it, I will help you save Wang Qiang,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“I am able to help senior retrieve that item. Merely, I have a question. Senior, are you able to guarantee that you will definitely be able to cure Wang Qiang’s injury?” Chu Feng asked.

He had to ask this question. He was not afraid of displeasing the Golden Crane True Immortal. After all... he was planning to use his life to obtain an opportunity.

If he was able to retrieve the item that the Golden Crane True Immortal requested, yet the Golden Crane True Immortal was unable to cure Wang Qiang, he would have suffered enormous losses.

“Haha...” At that moment, the Golden Crane True Immortal started laughing. It was a very profound laughter.

“If I am to tell you that I cannot guarantee that I will be able to cure Wang Qiang, will you still be willing to help me retrieve what I want?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked instead of answering.

“I am,” Chu Feng said without the slightest hesitation.

Even though he knew that things would be unfair if that were the case, he knew very well that he did not have a choice.

The reason for that was because it seemed that the Golden Crane True Immortal might be the only individual in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm capable of saving Wang Qiang.

“Good, frank and straightforward. You are indeed affectionate and true. That Wang Qiang is fortunate to have a friend like you.”

“That said, Chu Feng, even if you are willing to help, it is not a place that you can go to just because you want to,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“Senior, what do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’ve met that Young Master Li Ming, right? I believe you’ve heard that I wanted to take him as a disciple, but was refused by him, right?”

“Do you know why he would appear here?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.

“Could it be that he had something to request of you, senior?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’ve guessed correctly. Right now, both of you have things to request from me. However, I only need one person to go help me retrieve what I want.”

“Thus, I can only help one of you. As for who I will help, you two will have to strive for it yourselves,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.

“You want us to compete?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. I want the two of you to have a contest. The victor will be qualified to complete my task. Only then will you have a chance to be able to obtain my assistance.”

“I know the two of you already confronted one another just now. However, that cannot be regarded as an actual match. Actually, I am also providing this opportunity so that I can help you two.”

“I want the two of you, the two most famous geniuses of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, to compete with one another to determine who is superior,” the Golden Crane True Immortal said with a faint smile.

This smile was filled with anticipation.
