Chapter 3643 - Chu Feng’s Power

“Chu Feng, admitting defeat now is already too late.”

“It’s time for you to experience true power.”

After Nangong Yifan said those words, the enormous dragon started to roar nonstop. That enormous chess power dragon started to charge toward Chu Feng.

Seeing that, many of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations closed their eyes.

Even geniuses such as Long Ning closed their eyes.

They did not dare to continue to look. They knew that after Nangong Yifan’s attack landed, their Ancestral Martial Starfield would suffer a complete defeat.

There would not be anyone else that could contend against Nangong Yifan.

“Crash~~~”

However, after the enormous dragon composed of chess power rushed to attack Chu Feng, it’s body actually began to disintegrate.

At first, its horns broke off. Then, its claws also broke off.

Nangong Yifan felt very confused seeing that, However, he did not have the time to think too much about it. He continued to control the enormous chess power dragon to have it attack Chu Feng.

He knew very well that the might of the enormous dragon was very strong.

For other attacks, even if one was to destroy one’s opponent’s body, it would only be true inside the chess formation. Upon elimination and being sent out of the chess formation, there would not be any injury to the person eliminated.

However, the enormous chess power dragon was different. If Chu Feng was struck by it, not only would his body in the chess formation be destroyed, but he would also be injured upon being eliminated and sent out of the chess formation.

That was the reason why Nangong Yifan had insisted on using the enormous dragon to attack Chu Feng even after he had revealed a look of fear.

However, the speed at which the chess power dragon disintegrated continued to increase. In the beginning, it was only the horns and claws that disintegrated. However, as time passed, the entire dragon began to disintegrate.

When the dragon was less than a thousand meters away from Chu Feng, it shattered into pieces. The enormous dragon had turned into dust that filled the sky.

“What’s going on? How could this be?”

It was not only the crowd that were astonished; even Nangong Yifan himself had an astonished expression.

“Nangong Yifan, it would appear that while I can sense your chess power, you still haven’t managed to sense my chess power,” right at that moment, Chu Feng’s voice was heard.

When everyone looked at him, the fear on his face had not only completely disappeared, but he instead had a mischievous smile on his face.

“What do you mean?” Nangong Yifan’s heart sunk. This was the first time that he felt fear.

Chu Feng did not respond to Nangong Yifan’s question. Instead, the sneer on his face grew even more intense.

“Roooarrr~~~”

Suddenly, a roar sounded in the world.

That roar could be heard from every direction.

Following that, the crowd were able to see chess power visible to the naked eye surging in the third world. Like a sea, it filled the entire world.

It was not only limited to the third world. Such a phenomenon was also happening in the second and first worlds.

“How can this be? How can this be? What is this?”

At that moment, the people outside the chess formation also had looks of astonishment on their faces. Confused, they turned their gazes to Lord Shoujian.

Upon doing so, the expressions of the confused crowd grew even more complicated.

They were surprised to discover that even Lord Shoujian’s face was filled with shock. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Amazing. Truly amazing. This is the first time in this old man’s life to witness an existence this amazing,” Lord Shoujian exclaimed in admiration.

“Lord Shoujian, exactly what is happening? Why would such a change be happening in the chess formation?” asked the crowd.

“Can you sense it now?”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s voice sounded in the chess formation again.

“Impossible! This is impossible!” Nangong Yifan shook his head repeatedly. He seemed to have realized something. However, he was unwilling to recognize what he had realized.

“Unfortunately, although you managed to grasp an extremely powerful amount of chess power, something truly worthy of admiration, all the chess power in the chess formation is under my control. Even the chess power that you’ve grasped is under my control,” said Chu Feng.

“What? All under his control? What nonsense is this?”

“Right, that must be nonsense. Lord Shoujian, tell us, this Chu Feng is spouting nonsense, no?”

The people outside the chess formation burst into a complete uproar. Like Nangong Yifan, they were also unable to accept such a fact. Thus, they all turned their gazes to Lord Shoujian. They wanted him to deny Chu Feng’s claim.

However, Lord Shoujian completely ignored the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations.

His aged eyes were shining with light as his gaze was fixed on the chess formation.

His attention was completely captured by the chess formation. He was unwilling to shift his gaze away for even a split second.

Thus, it wasn’t that he didn’t hear the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations. It was rather that he was simply unwilling to bother with them.

“Chu Feng, tell me, exactly what sort of heretical ability did you use?”

“You were clearly scared witless by Nangong Yifan’s chess power earlier, how could you say that you’re able to control all the chess power in the world now?” A person of the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generation asked.

That question was also what many people wanted to ask.

Chu Feng was clearly scared witless by Nangong Yifan earlier. He was so scared that his legs were trembling and his voice was shaking. Thus, how could he have such a confident look on his face so quickly?

“Haha, you all are truly adorable.”

“Since Nangong Yifan decided to go all-out against me, I decided to give him and you all some face by cooperating with him, and putting on a disguise of nervousness. There’s nothing wrong with that, no?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“What? That was done on purpose?”

“He did it on purpose?!”

The crowd no longer knew what sort of expression to make to convey their emotions after hearing Chu Feng’s words.

“Deliberately pretending to be weak? Fuck! Say, big brother, this friend of yours is truly shameless, even more shameless than you,” Kong Ci said to Kong Tianhui.

“I’m fond of his shamelessness,” said Wuming Yuanzhi.

“Ah?”

The crowd’s jaws all dropped upon hearing those words. After all, Wuming Yuanzhi was the person who had violently beaten Chu Feng earlier.

However, at that moment, Wuming Yuanzhi had a look, a gaze, of someone that had fallen in love with Chu Feng.

“Damn it! That Chu Feng dared to toy with our Yifan?!”

Compared to the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield that were taking joy in Nangong Yifan’s calamity, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were all fuming with rage between gritted teeth,

When they looked to Nangong Yifan inside the chess formation, pain filled their hearts.

Nangong Yifan was a child beloved by the heavens. Never before had he received such humiliation.

“Eeaahhh~~~”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard in the chess formation. It was Nangong Yifan.

Boundless chess power surged out from Nangong Yifan’s body again. Soon, another enormous dragon formed from the chess power.

That enormous chess power dragon was even larger than the previous one.

“Clamor~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng waved his sleeve. The enormous dragon instantly disintegrated and turned into dust that dispersed into the air.

“You!!!”

Nangong Yifan’s eyes were wide with fury. He looked at Chu Feng with a killing intent-filled gaze. He didn’t only want to kill Chu Feng, but he was itching to dismember Chu Feng into ten thousand pieces.

However, after taking a glance at him, Nangong Yifan turned that killing-intent filled gaze away.

Following that, he did something that surprised everyone. He released his chess power again and formed another enormous dragon.

“It would appear that you still haven’t sensed it.”

“Since that’s the case, I’ll let you sense it vividly.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng opened his palm and aimed it at Nangong Yifan.

The crowd were able to see chess power visible to the nake eye rushing out from Nangong Yifan’s body like a tide.

It was surging toward Chu Feng.

The chess power was entering Chu Feng’s palm.

Chu Feng was actually absorbing Nangong Yifan’s chess power.
