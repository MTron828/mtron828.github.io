Chapter 3347 - Unfair Match

“It would appear that the person that you all are punishing is quite extraordinary. That person was actually able to endure the first Heavenly Lighting of that caliber and receive another,” Wuming Fenghuo said.

Wuming Fenghuo did not use any special methods to observe the situation. Merely, as his cultivation was simply too strong, the distance that he could see was much farther than that of other martial cultivators. Furthermore, the location of the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform was very low, which made it so that the Heavenly Lightning would be very clear when it struck. Thus, as long as Wuming Fenghuo paid close attention to it, he would be able to see everything.

However, as the Heavenly Lightning had surrounded Chu Feng, his observation from such a distance was unable to allow him to determine who it was that was being surrounded by the Heavenly Lightning. That was the reason why he made such a statement.

“Milord, that person is nothing more than a scum of our clan,” Chu Hanqing said.

Hearing those words, Wuming Fenghuo did not press the matter. Instead, he turned his head. Even though the Divine Tribulation’s Lightning from earlier was indeed very mighty, everyone believed it to be the Heavenly Lightning from the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform. Thus, Wuming Fenghuo and the others were not interested in the matter.

“Since our Starfield Master Realm is going to preside over the contest between your two clans, the rules of the match will naturally be determined by our Starfield Master Realm.”

After Wuming Gangxiong said those words, his hand streaked across his Cosmos Sack. In the next moment, a body of light the size of his palm appeared in his hand.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Wuming Gangxiong raised his arm, and the body of light immediately began to expand. In a flash, it covered the central region of the entire plaza.

At that moment, the eyes of everyone started to shine. They were all able to tell that it was not an ordinary spirit formation. Instead, it was a treasure that contained a formation within it.

The treasure was transparent, and resembled a shrunken world. Being in the vicinity of the plaza, the crowd seemed to possess god-like abilities, and were able to clearly see everything within that small-scale world.

The small world was separated into two fronts by a river in the middle.

The two fronts respectively possessed sixty camps. Two banners were placed in each camp.

Both sides thus possessed sixty camps, and a hundred and twenty banners.

As for the banners, they each had ‘Chu Heavenly Clan’ and ‘Fang Heavenly Clan’ written on them Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“People of the Chu Heavenly Clan and Fang Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, listen up! Everyone that is under three-hundred and sixty years of age, enter your respective camps,” Wuming Gangxiong ordered.

After he said those words, a war chariot that was floating in the sky descended to the plaza before the Fang Heavenly Clan’s camp’s entrance.

A total of three thousand of the Fang Heavenly Clan’s younger generations walked out from the war chariot in an orderly manner.

Those were all the Fang Heavenly Clan’s elites under three hundred and sixty years of age. They all possessed extraordinary strength and outstanding talent.

Among them, the person who was the most eye-catching was a particularly robust man that was three meters tall, with tanned skin.

Not only did that man possess a very robust look, but an air of arrogance also filled his face. As he gave off an extraordinary air, he looked particularly eye-catching among the crowd of Fang Heavenly Clansmen.

His name was Fang Hualong. He was three hundred and fifty-nine years old.

Fang Hualong possessed extraordinary talent, and was deemed to be the strongest genius to have ever appeared in the Fang Heavenly Clan within the last ten thousand years. He was also the reason why the participants of the match were allowed to only be people of the younger generation within three hundred and sixty years of age.

Fang Hualong was the trump card of the Fang Heavenly Clan.

Fang Hualong had already become a rank six Martial Immortal many years ago. Rumors had it that he had been in closed-door training the entire time. Thus, it was very likely that he had already reached rank seven Martial Immortal.

However, at that moment, Fang Hualong was likely concealing his cultivation through the use of a treasure. Thus, not even Chu Hanpeng was able to see through his cultivation.

Because of this, Chu Hanpeng felt even more uneasy.

It was common knowledge that Fang Hualong was already a rank six Martial Immortal long ago. Thus, there should be no need for him to conceal his cultivation. For Fang Hualong to conceal his cultivation before so many seniors, it likely meant that he had reached a breakthrough, and become a rank seven Martial Immortal.

“Sure enough, that child came,” at the moment when Chu Hanpeng and the others saw Fang Hualong, they were already prepared to lose.

Even if Fang Hualong’s cultivation had not reached rank seven Martial Immortal, their Chu Heavenly Clan would simply not have anyone that could match him should Chu Feng not be able to face him.

“We pay our respect to the lords.”

After the Fang Heavenly Clan’s younger generations walked out from their war chariot, they did not immediately enter the spirit formation, but instead respectfully greeted Wuming Fenghuo, Wuming Gangxiong and the others.

“There’s no need to stand on ceremony. Go on in,” Wuming Gangxiong waved his hand.

Seeing this, Fang Hualong and the rest of the three thousand Fang Heavenly Clan’s younger generations walked into the spirit formation.

After they entered the spirit formation, they immediately shrunk in size, appearing to be many times smaller than ants.

The reason for that was because the world inside the treasure was actually much larger than the plaza. That was the reason why their bodies became so small after they entered the spirit formation.

It wasn’t that they had shrunk in size. Rather, it was due to the treasure.

After the Fang Heavenly Clan’s younger generations entered the spirit formation, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations within three hundred and sixty years of age also began to enter it.

Compared to the three thousand Fang Heavenly Clansmen, there were a lot more Chu Heavenly Clansmen. Their number totaled more than ten thousand.

However, they were not the elites.

In fact, before arriving on the plaza, and even when they first saw Wuming Gangxiong and the others, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation had no idea that such a match would take place.

It was not only them. In fact, many other people from the Chu Heavenly Clan did not know about the match.

The reason for that was because the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had simply never mentioned it to them.

As such, they were appointed to their duty completely unprepared. Compared to the Fang Heavenly Clan’s elites, those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations possessed no fighting spirit at all.

After all, they all knew that they were no match for Fang Hualong. Not to mention the Fang Heavenly Clan having three thousand elites, even Fang Hualong himself would be sufficient to completely annihilate them.

This match was already lost from the very start.

“Younger generations of the Fang Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan, listen up! You are allowed to attack one another and snatch each other’s positions. As long as you do not kill your opponent, all abilities are allowed.”

“In two hours, whichever side seizes more of the opponent’s camps shall be the victor.”

“Do you all understand?!” Wuming Gangxiong spoke loudly.

“Milord, we understand.”

Once Wuming Gangxiong’s voice was heard, a thunderous response emerged from the formation.

The treasure did not isolate sound. Thus, the people inside were all able to hear everything said by the people outside. Likewise, what was said by the people inside could be heard by the people outside.

“Very well, you will now have an incense stick’s worth of time to create a strategy among yourselves. After the incense stick’s worth of time is up, the match will officially begin,” Wuming Gangxiong said.

After he finished saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations immediately gathered and began to communicate with each other through voice transmission.

Compared to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, the Fang Heavenly Clan’s younger generations began to disperse to occupy their respective camps in an orderly manner.

It would appear that, compared to the Chu Heavenly Clan, they already knew about the rules of the match.

The Chu Heavenly Clan felt very displeased upon witnessing this scene. However, there was nothing they could do. After all, this was not a fair match to begin with.

Suddenly, the Fang Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Chu Hanpeng. “Chu Hanpeng, there’s one thing that I wanted to tell your clan chief. However, since he’s sick, you’ll have to listen on his behalf.”

“Brother Fang, please go ahead and tell me what it is,” Chu Hanpeng said.

“Our Fang Heavenly Clan is determined to win this match. Thus, our Fang Heavenly Clan is also determined to win the Purpletree Ordinary Realm. I hope that your Chu Heavenly Clan will be prepared, and not feel too sad about it,” the Fang Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke with a beaming smile.

Provocation. That was absolutely an act of provocation. Hearing those words, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan all felt furious.

They all knew very well that, if their clan and the Fang Heavenly Clan were to fight normally, the Fang Heavenly Clan might not necessarily be a match for their Chu Heavenly Clan.

It was due to the Starfield Master Realm’s interference that the match was no longer fair, and the Fang Heavenly Clan were able to act so arrogantly.

However, apart from feeling furious, the Chu Heavenly Clan did not even dare to voice their anger. The reason for that was because they were afraid, deeply afraid of the people from the Starfield Master Realm.

Thus, although they were furious, they could only choose to endure their anger.

They even went so far as to choose to...

...look on helplessly as the predetermined losing match unfolded.

...look on helplessly as the Purpletree Ordinary Realm controlled by them was about to be snatched away by the Fang Heavenly Clan.
