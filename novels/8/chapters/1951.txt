Chapter 1951 - The Path To Heaven

“Roar~~~~”

Seeing that there was no response from Chu Feng after a long time, the Qilin revealed a slightly relaxed expression. Then, it let out a different sort of roar. It was as if it were announcing its victory.

“Clank~~~”

Right at that moment, a cold flash suddenly shot out from the sea of flames.

The Qilin was surprised upon seeing that. It opened its mouth again, planning to shoot out another golden sphere of light.

However, the golden flash was too fast. In merely the blink of an eye, it arrived at the Qilin’s throat and sealed the Qilin’s movements. The Qilin was denied the opportunity to shoot out another sphere of golden light.

It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had broken out of the sea of flames with his Heavenly Immortal Sword in hand. His Heavenly Immortal Sword was now pointed at the Qilin’s throat.

Chu Feng was not injured in the slightest. He had achieved this through the use of his two Supreme Secret Skills, the Black Tortoise Armor Technique and the Vermillion Bird Revival Technique.

It turned out that Chu Feng had deliberately let out that miserable scream from earlier. His intention was for the Qilin would lower its guard.

“Little fellow, there can never be too much deception in war. Next time, remember that,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile., Even though he had suppressed the Qilin, he did not kill it.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng was truly reluctant to kill that Qilin. He had actually only come to this place with the intent to challenge the Qilin, and not to actually kill it.

“Roar~~~”

Suddenly, the Qilin let out a low roar. Then, its body began to blossom with light. Then, it began to shrink. In merely the blink of an eye, the Qilin had turned into an arrow.

That arrow was filled with scale-like veined patterns. It also possessed the same sort of aura as the Qilin had. The Qilin was actually also formed from an arrow.

“So you were also an arrow?”

Chu Feng was shocked. He had thought that the Qilin might be the same as those golden armored soldiers. Even though it possessed awareness, it was not an actual Divine Beast.

However, Chu Feng did not expect for that Qilin to actually be an arrow. In simpler terms, that Qilin was none other than a treasure; it was not an actual living thing. Yet... it was able to conceal that from Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes.

“Exactly what sort of individual was capable of creating a treasure like you?”

“It should be the same person that created this golden palace, right?” At that moment, Chu Feng was gasping in admiration.

Even though he was already someone capable of calling the wind and summoning the rain in the Holy Land of Martialism, he felt himself to be extremely small in the golden palace. All of his techniques and abilities were useless here.

“Rumble~~~~”

At the moment when Chu Feng was gasping in admiration, the tightly shut entrance to the Fourth Level Hall started to open with a rumble.

When the Fourth Level Hall opened, Chu Feng started to frown. Cautiously, he moved back; away from that Fourth Level Hall’s entrance.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng felt an extremely dangerous aura from the Fourth Level Hall. Different from the First, Second and Third Level Halls, the Fourth Level Hall emitted a very intense, a very terrifying, killing intent.

After the Fourth Level Hall’s entrance opened completely, the frown on Chu Feng’s face became even more wrinkled.

In the Fourth Level Hall was a dense amount of gray mist. More accurately, it was dark gray in color.

Most importantly, even Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes were unable to see through the dark gray mist. As such, he did not know exactly what might be contained in the Fourth Level Hall.

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

............

Right at that moment, crimson eyes appeared in the dark gray mist. Those crimson eyes were not very large; only about the size of a human’s eyes. However, their number was extremely large. Densely packed, they covered practically the entire Fourth Level Hall.

Upon seeing the thousands, no, the tens of thousands of crimson eyes, Chu Feng’s heart started to tighten. He felt as if his hair was standing on end.

Monster. Chu Feng felt that what was contained within the Fourth Level Hall must be a true monster. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

That monster did not utter any ear-piercing roars or frightening oppressive might. Yet, merely by looking at Chu Feng, Chu Feng felt as if his blood was running cold. Chu Feng was able to realize how dangerous that monster was.

Chu Feng did not continue forward. He did not plan to enter the Fourth Level Hall. It was not that Chu Feng was afraid. Rather, Chu Feng felt that, with his current cultivation, he would definitely be killed should he enter the Fourth Level Hall.

Thus, Chu Feng grabbed the Qilin Arrow and left the golden palace.

“Little friend Chu Feng, it seems that you’ve succeeded.”

“Not bad, not bad,” After Chu Feng walked out of the golden palace, Long Lin began to clap his hands upon seeing the Qilin Arrow in Chu Feng’s hand.

“Senior,” Chu Feng handed the Qilin Arrow to Long Lin.

“No, since you’ve conquered it, it is yours now. The way to use this Qilin Arrow is the same as the arrows you’ve obtained before. However, its might is capable of killing ordinary rank seven Martial Emperors. It might be of use to you,” Long Lin said.

“Rank seven Martial Emperor? Merely with that arrow?” The crowd all looked to that Qilin Arrow in shock upon hearing what Long Lin said.

Nangong Longjian and Lord Lianghua began to recall the rumor of Chu Feng killing Martial Emperors on the Gong Ba Plains with arrows. Upon thinking of that, they came to a sudden realization.

They began to believe what Long Lin had said to be true. At the same time, they came to know where Chu Feng’s arrows had been obtained. Likely, they were also from that miraculous golden palace.

“Senior Long Lin, I have a question that I wish to ask you,” Chu Feng said.

“If it’s only a question, ask away,” Long Lin said.

“You must’ve known from the very beginning that my Inherited Bloodline is a Heavenly Bloodline, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. If you didn’t possess a Heavenly Bloodline, you would not have been able to help me break free and destroy that tree,” As Long Lin said those words, he looked to the giant tree.

Chu Feng followed his gaze and discovered that the giant tree had withered completely. It no longer possessed a trace of life left; it had completely died.

Seeing such a tree dying, Chu Feng’s heart was filled with regret.

“However, Chu Feng, I must tell you this. Even for those who possess Heavenly Bloodlines, not all of them would have been able to walk out from the space within that tree alive. Furthermore, not all of them would have been capable of helping me.”

“You are stronger than ordinary descendants of a Heavenly Bloodline. Perhaps, you might be able to play a role in the Outer World in the future.”

“However, I shall warn you of this. If you are to really enter the Outer World in the future, you must absolutely not mention our relationship to anyone, for it will only be detrimental to you.”

“Pretend that we have never met before. Our destiny shall split at this point forth,” After Long Lin finished saying those words, he suddenly threw the golden palace into the sky.

“Rumble~~~”

In an instant, black clouds and thunder began to surge about. As for that golden palace, it turned into a golden ray of light that charged straight into the sky. It was as if it was going to reach the end of the sky.

“Buzz~~~”

Soon, other than the golden ray of light that was still present, everything else in the sky turned into an enormous vortex. That vortex slowly revolved around the end of the golden ray of light.

A path to heaven. That golden ray of light appeared like a path to heaven.

It was different from the Eastern Sea Region’s Heavenly Road that connected to the Holy Land of Martialism. It was an actual path to the heavens. Through that path, one could enter the Outer World.

[1. Outer World is actually written as “Heavens Outside”; aka, the world outside of the world you know.]
