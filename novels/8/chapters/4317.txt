Chapter 4317 - Like A False Display

Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground was located in a continuous mountain range.

If one were to look down from above, one will be able to shockingly discover there was a mountain that resembled a dragon in the continuous mountain range.

It resembled a giant dragon coiling in the continuous mountain range.

But, that was not an artificially constructed mountain. Instead, it was formed naturally.

That was the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground.

“This place is truly astonishing.”

Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were standing in the sky.

Even though they’ve yet to enter the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground, Chu Feng could already sense the exception aura emitted by it.

Even though that Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground was clearly a mountain, it was emitting an intangible sort of oppressive might.

That was not the ordinary oppressive might that martial cultivators possess.

Instead, it resembled the innate oppressive might possessed by ferocious beasts.

It was a sort of ‘natural’ oppressive might.

“That’s not all. Entering it is extremely difficult to do too,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist as Chu Feng gasped in admiration.

“Master, is it really that difficult to enter it?” asked Chu Feng.

“It’s more than difficult. If we are to rely on our own abilities, trying to enter it within a short period of time would be practically impossible.”

“This old man had also underestimated this Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Master, what are we supposed to do then?”

While Chu Feng realized that it would be very difficult to enter the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground, he also realized from the tone of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist possessed a method to enter.

“There’s always a method. Since the two of us, master and disciple, will not be able to easily enter the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground with our own abilities, we’ll have to seek out a way through the Dragon Clan itself.”

“Let’s go.”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words, he brought Chu Feng along and left the forbidden area.

They began to proceed toward the location of the Dragon Clan’s upper echelons.

In the end, they’ve arrived at an extravagant palace.

This extravagant palace was located above the clouds. Not only was it a dazzling sight, it resembled the residence of immortals as it was offset by the clouds.

While the palace was located above the clouds, it was very difficult to reach it.

This place was also a forbidden area within the Dragon Clan. Not to mention outsiders, even within the Dragon Clan, only those with a certain level of status will be able to enter this place.

As such, it was only natural for a place like that to be tightly guarded.

Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist entered this place effortlessly.

Regardless of what sort of spirit formations were present, they were all akin to false displays before him.

It was so much that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had already effortlessly breached those spirit formations before Chu Feng could even discover them.

Following such an Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng felt extremely safe.

After all, this place was the Dragon Clan of all places.

To be able to move about the Dragon Clan completely unhindered, one could tell how exceptionally powerful the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s world spirit techniques were.

Chu Feng even doubted if the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s world spirit techniques were really only at rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation.

“Master, is this how powerful rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation is?”

“How come the Dragon Clan’s numerous layers of protections are all useless toward you?” Finally, Chu Feng voiced his curiosity.

“Rank five Dragon Transformation is extremely powerful. Back then, your master managed to firmly stabilize my throne as the Holy Light Galaxy’s number one galaxy using that.”

“Of course, like martial cultivation, a world spiritist’s ability at a certain level also depended on the individual.”

“Your master’s world spirit techniques are naturally not something that others could rival,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist immensely pleased.

“How come I feel that master’s world spirit techniques are not merely rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation?” Chu Feng revealed a look of suspicion.

“It would appear that this old man’s world spirit techniques had truly reached a level surpassing that of ordinary people.”

“Else, you, my genius disciple of a world spiritist, wouldn’t fail to realize what level my world spirit techniques are either.”

The look of compliance on the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s face grew even more intense.

“Master, are you really not lying to this disciple? Are you really rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation?” asked Chu Feng.

“Why would I lie to you? If I’m not rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, I would’ve gone seek out that Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted to settle the debt already. Why would I bother to conceal my identity?” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Indeed. It would appear that master is truly a genius then,” said Chu Feng with a smile.

“Enough with the flattering. Wait for me here.”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he raised one arm and a concealment formation landed on Chu Feng.

“Master, are you not planning to allow me to accompany you?” asked Chu Feng.

“There’s a lot of experts in there. It’s better that you wait for me here. It’s safer here,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Master, you’re able to see who’s inside?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had attempted to examine the palace using his Heaven’s Eyes.

Unfortunately, the spirit formations around the palace hall were very ancient and powerful. Chu Feng was unable to see through them with his Heaven’s Eyes.

But, from what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said, it seemed like he already knew what sort of people were inside that palace.

“A guess.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ox-nosed Old Daoist smiled. Then, he turned around and left.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not open the entrance to the palace hall. Instead, he passed through the walls.

“And you’re still saying you can’t see the insides?”

Chu Feng frowned. He felt that he was deceived.

Chu Feng was incapable of even seeing through the spirit formation on the palace. Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist managed to effortlessly pass through it.

Chu Feng does not believe that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was unable to see through that spirit formation, unable to see the situation within the palace.

“I’ve always had a feeling that this master of mine is even more remarkable than my imagination.”

“Could this be the abilities of the world spiritist that was once the strongest in the Holy Light Galaxy?”

Chu Feng still felt the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s true strength was more powerful than his imagination.

Ignoring the fact that he was able to help him fuse with his Divine Power, merely the various abilities the Ox-nosed Old Daoist displayed today was enough to make Chu Feng gasp in amazement.

In fact, it could even be said that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist weren’t actually unleashing a display of his abilities at all.

After all, the various layers of protective formations were all akin to false displays. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had never bothered to put forth the effort to set up any real spirit formation to breach those protective formations.

It was because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was simply too powerful that Chu Feng began to doubt whether or not he was hiding his true strength.

Even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist explicitly told him that he was not concealing his strength, Chu Feng felt those words to not be very trustworthy.
