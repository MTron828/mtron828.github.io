Chapter 4036 - Special Reciprocation

Chu Feng walked over to Tuoba Chengan’s badly damaged corpse and collected his Cosmos Sack and treasures.

He did not even let Tuoba Chengan’s source energy slip away from his hands.

He collected Tuoba Chengan’s source energy so that Her Lady Queen could use it when she woke up.

Chu Feng maintained this habit the entire time whilst Her Lady Queen was in closed-door training.

While he would not bother collecting the source energies of those with low cultivations, he would always collect the source energies of those with strong cultivation for Her Lady Queen’s future usage before killing them.

“Everyone, farewell.”

After collecting Tuoba Chengan’s source energy, Chu Feng planned to leave.

Saving those monstrous clansmen was nothing more than an act in passing for Chu Feng. As he did not possess any relationship with them, he was not concerned with what they planned to do in the future.

“Milord, please wait.”

Right when Chu Feng was about to leave, an old Underground Iron Beast suddenly called out to him.

Chu Feng turned around and discovered that all of the Underground Iron Beasts were kneeling on the ground.

“Everyone, I’ve already said that there was a personal grudge between Tuoba Chengan and myself. Even if you all weren’t present, I wouldn’t have let him off.”

“There is no need for you all to act like this. Come, you all stand back up,” as Chu Feng spoke, he raised his arm, and all the Underground Iron Beasts rose to their feet following his movement.

Chu Feng had used his power to forcibly stand them up.

After the Underground Iron Beasts got to their feet, that old monstrous beast from earlier actually did something astonishing.

He raised his arm and sent it downward abruptly. ‘Puchi,’ he thrust his claw into his own body.

Then, an even more astonishing sight occurred. All the Underground Iron Beasts present actually started doing the same thing as that old man. They too thrust their claws into their bodies.

“You all, what are you doing?”

Chu Feng was completely stupefied by the scene before him.

Even if they were grateful toward him, there shouldn’t be a need for them to mutilate themselves, no?

Could this be the special etiquette of the Underground Iron Beasts?

Did they injure themselves as a way of expressing gratitude toward people that bestowed great help to them?

Or could it be that Chu Feng’s refusal to allow them to kneel to him had angered them, causing them to do such a drastic thing?

No matter how Chu Feng thought of it, he found it to be rather unreasonable.

“Lord Benefactor, you’ve saved us today and prevented the extinction of our clan.”

“The grace you’ve shown us is something that we cannot possibly repay.”

“As such, we can only do what we can to repay Lord Benefactor. Lord Benefactor, please accept this.”

“Puu~~~”

After that old man finished saying those words, he pulled his claw from his body.

“Puu, puu, puu, puu~~~”

Following him, all of the Underground Iron Beasts pulled their claws from their bodies.

What happened afterwards stupefied Chu Feng again.

He was astonished to discover that blood began to flow from the Underground Iron Beasts’ self-inflicted wounds.

It was no ordinary blood. The blood had a green glow, and emitted a special aura.

Chu Feng could tell from a single glance that the blood contained bloodline power.

Rather than calling it blood, it would be more accurate to call it their special bloodline.

As the blood flowed from their bodies, all the Underground Iron Beasts appeared as if they’d suffered serious injuries, and became extremely weak.

Many among them even fell powerlessly to the ground without even the strength to stand back up.

Their reactions were understandable. After all, bloodlines were the foundations of martial cultivators.

For ordinary people, their bloodline power was something that they could not control at all.

It was already an exceptionally astonishing feat that those Underground Iron Beasts were capable of controlling their bloodline power.

As for extracting their bloodline power from within their bodies, that was even more astonishing.

Of course, it was natural that their actions of forcibly releasing their bloodline power from their bodies would be very damaging.

However, even with that being the case, that old beast still persisted.

He continued standing, and began to form a special hand seal to control the blood that was released from his fellow clansmen, sending it all towards the spirit formation used to refine the rocks.

“Buzz~~~”

When all of the Underground Iron Beasts’ blood entered the spirit formation, the spirit formation immediately started to change. It turned into a boundless amount of gaseous flames that soared upward towards the enormous rock above. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Under the impact of the gas, the rock not only began to shatter, but it even began to turn into gaseous flames directly.

Seeing the transformation to the rocks, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.

It turned out that what the Underground Iron Beasts had done, had strengthened the power of the grand formation.

At that moment, the power of the grand formation had reached a state so strong that it could refine the enormous rock above it.

Furthermore, it was refining it very quickly.

That said, the power of the grand formation was also gradually dissipating as it refined the enormous rock.

Fortunately, by the time the grand formation’s power had disappeared completely, the enormous rock had already been refined whole.

The power released by the refined rock was carefully placed in a vessel by the old man before being brought over to Chu Feng.

Seeing that vessel, Chu Feng knew what sort of repayment the old beast had been talking about earlier.

They planned to repay Chu Feng’s grace with the power refined from the special rock.

“Lord Benefactor, please, you must accept this.”

That old beast knelt before Chu Feng.

The other Underground Iron Beasts, although extremely weakened, gathered their strength and brought themselves to kneel before Chu Feng with great difficulty.

They were no longer only expressing their thanks to Chu Feng; they were also urging him to accept their gift.

“It would appear that I have no choice but to accept this.”

Chu Feng accepted the boundless power. Once he accepted it, he immediately said, “I’ve already accepted it, you all can stop kneeling now.”

Even though Chu Feng had said those words, those Underground Iron Beasts kept kneeling.

It was only after that beast waved his hand that they stopped kneeling.

It could be seen that the old beast was most likely someone who held great authority among the Underground Iron Beasts.

If Chu Feng was correct, the old beast should be someone akin to their clan chief.

“Since you all are capable of directly refining that rock, why didn’t you do so? Why brave the danger of being beaten and witness the sacrifice of your clansmen that entered the spirit formation? Why did you all insist on excavating and refining the rock bit by bit?”

Chu Feng asked what he was most confused about.

“That Tuoba Chengan was a vicious and ruthless fellow. He trapped us here because he wanted to obtain the power contained in that rock. If the Bloodline Rock remained, we would still be of value to him. However, should the Bloodline Rock disappear...”

The old beast did not finish his words. He stopped with a sigh filled with helplessness.

Chu Feng came to a realization upon hearing those words.

Tuoba Chengan was simply too ruthless. If those Underground Iron Beasts were no longer of any use to him, only the extermination of their clan awaited them.

Tuoba Chengan wouldn’t possibly let them out. He wouldn’t possibly allow them to spread word of his wicked deeds.

It was no wonder that those Underground Iron Beasts would rather be beaten and have their clansmen be sacrificed than to directly use their bloodline power to refine the enormous rock.

After all, even though they would live their lives in misery, there would still be a chance of survival. At the very least, their clan would still exist.
