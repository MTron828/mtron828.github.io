Chapter 5928: The Arrogant Long Mochuan

“You’re indeed a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist, and I don’t deny you are strong, but if rank eight True Dragon World Spiritists are truly omnipotent, your Dragon Breath Clan wouldn’t have required my big brother Chu Feng’s help. He might just be at God-cloak, but he possesses Heaven’s Eyes.”

Long Mochuan fell silent. He knew that the Dragon Breath Clan needed the help of someone with Heaven’s Eyes, but he refused to concede defeat and argued, “Heaven’s Eyes might be formidable means, but it isn’t omnipotent either. It can’t bridge the gap in spirit power. All right, we should leave now. Young friends, you shouldn’t linger either.”

Long Mochuan turned around and left.

“Leave?” Zi Ling looked at Chu Feng.

“They must have completed that teleportation formation,” Chu Feng replied.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling made their way to the teleportation formation. As Chu Feng had guessed, the teleportation formation was completed, and it was now linked to the reparation formation.

“Lord Mucheng, are you preparing to leave?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, Chu Feng. For your safety, I suggest that you and Miss Zi Ling leave first and wait outside for us. Once we’re done, we can head to the Dragon Breath Clan’s territory together.

“Our Dragon Breath Clan might be unable to oppose the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion head-on, but we can secretly protect you. You’ll be safe in our Dragon Breath Clan,” Long Mucheng said with a smile.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling had felt Long Mucheng’s goodwill over the past few days.

Long Mucheng was old enough to be their grandmother, but her vibrant demeanor made her seem like a big sister instead.

Some people continued to maintain a childlike heart unfazed by the secular even as they got older, though there were also people who lost their inner child at a young age and became like an old man early on.

“Lord Mucheng, I advise you not to use the teleportation formation,” Chu Feng said.

“Why?” Long Mucheng asked.

“This is Lord Qn Jiu’s domain. While it was the mysterious woman who imposed the restriction formation on your clan, she used Lord Qin Jiu’s formation for that. That teleportation formation won’t be enough for you to breach Lord Qin Jiu’s restriction formation in his domain.

“The consequences will be dire if you activate the teleportation formation. Your life might even be in danger,” Chu Feng said.

“We know that it’ll be dangerous, but what can we do? Remain cooped up here will we die?” Long Mochuan asked.

“Indeed. This is the solution Lord Mochuan and our chief world spiritist came up with together.”

“Chu Feng, you might be Jie Ranqing’s son, but it doesn’t change the fact that you’re still a God-cloak World Spiritist.”

“Touch your heart. Do you think your discernment will be sharper than two True Dragon World Spiritists?”

Quite a few Dragon Breath Clansmen stood on Long Mochuan’s side.

“Cough cough... Let me say something. My brother was the one who proposed using this teleportation formation. I remain skeptical of its plausibility, and I have stated many times that attempting to leave via the teleportation formation will be highly risky. I only agreed to go along with it because the majority of our clan wishes to proceed with it,” Long Moxiao pointed out.

“Moxiao, are you siding with Chu Feng right now?” Long Mochuan glared at Long Moxiao in dissatisfaction.

“Big brother, that’s not what I mean. I just think that we need to be more prudent,” Long Moxiao replied.

He might be the chief world spiritist, but he still respected his big brother a lot.

“Lord Mucheng, the restriction formation imposed on you is indeed linked to this formation realm. As long as this place is completely repaired, the restriction formation will automatically unravel, and you’ll regain your freedom,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re stating the obvious. The problem here is that this place can’t be repaired that easily! We’d take at least tens of thousands of years to achieve that. Why should we be trapped in here and become free labor for someone we don’t even know?” Long Mochuan roared.

Chu Feng ignored him and instead looked at Long Mucheng. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He could tell that the Dragon Breath Clan didn’t have a clan chief at the moment. While Long Mucheng was Long Muchuang and Long Moxiao’s junior, she was currently the decision-maker in the Dragon Breath Clan

“Lord Mucheng, I have figured out the secrets behind this place. There is a pattern to the formation realm that perhaps even the mysterious woman is oblivious of. From that, I devised a method to significantly boost the efficiency of the reparation formation. If it goes well, you might be able to break out in less than a year. Otherwise, it’ll take at most a hundred years,” Chu Feng said.

“So fast?”

“Is that for real?”

A huge commotion broke out in the Dragon Breath Clan.

The thought of staying here for tens of thousands of years was unbearable to them, but a hundred years was still within the range of what they could accept. In fact, they would be willing to stay here for even a thousand years now if there was a safer option.

“What a joke! We have to first fill the reparation formation with our dragon breath energy before it can be activated. Till then, the reparation formation won’t repair the crack. Besides, the reparation formation is damaged. How can you be certain your method will work?” Long Mochuan was skeptical.

“Chu Feng, are you serious about it?” Long Mucheng.

She also found it hard to believe that Chu Feng could reduce the reparation time from tens of thousands of years to merely a hundred years, or even a single year.

However, the crowd was overjoyed to hear the news.

Long Mochuan quickly rushed to Long Mucheng’s side and advised, “Mucheng, you mustn’t believe that brat’s words. He might be Jie Ranqing’s son, but he’s a God-cloak World Spiritist, not to mention a junior. I doubt if Jie Ranqing could have done much even if she was here.

“No matter what, I am a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist. Do you think my judgment would pale in comparison to his? Who does he think he is? Qin Jiu’s disciple? What gives him the guts to say that he can see through Qin Jiu’s formations? Don’t you think it’s laughable?” Long Mochuan sneered.

Chu Feng shook his head and chuckled.
