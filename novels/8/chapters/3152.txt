Chapter 3152 - The Cause Of The Abnormal Sign

“Chu Hongyi, look carefully. These people are all part of our Chu Heavenly Clan. They are your brothers and sisters. Flowing within their veins is the same blood as yours,” Chu Feng pointed to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were previously captured and tortured.

“When they were being tortured by others, you didn’t dare to even fart.”

“Yet now, when I am standing up for them and teaching the people that tortured them a lesson, you actually started shouting at me, blaming me for involving myself in this?”

“Chu Hongyi, I will only ask you this one question today. Are you still a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan?”

“You should also ask yourself if you are qualified to be a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan,” Chu Feng pointed at Chu Hongyi and spoke one word at a time.

His voice was very powerful and resounding. It was akin to rolling thunder.

His every word was like a sharp sword, penetrating Chu Hongyi’s heart and the hearts of all the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present.

“You!!!” Chu Hongyi was left speechless. He started to tremble with anger. However, he didn’t know how to refute Chu Feng.

He was unable to refute him, and in fact was embarrassed to do so.

After all, what Chu Feng had said was the truth.

“Me? What about me?”

“You should be asking yourself if you are thinking for the sake of our Chu Heavenly Clan’s brothers and sisters, or if you’re thinking for your own sake.”

“Today, it would be one thing if these people had cultivations above your own, and you knew that you wouldn’t be able to save our clansmen.”

“However, these Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen clearly had cultivations inferior to yours. Yet you still decided to look on without lifting a finger.”

“As for the reason why you decided to do nothing, it’s actually because you were afraid of retaliation from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan.”

“Just because you were afraid of retaliation, you decided to look on unfeelingly as your clansmen, your brothers and sisters that had followed you for many years, were tortured.”

“Chu Hongyi, you are so much of a coward that I, Chu Feng, am simply incapable of tolerating you anymore,” Chu Feng pointed at Chu Hongyi.

“You... you are sowing dissension! Sowing dissension!”

“Brothers and sisters, I, Chu Hongyi, am not someone who is craven and cowardly. You all should know that, don’t you?” Chu Hongyi looked to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen beside him.

At that moment, the crowd lowered their heads and did not answer him.

However, their silence was the best response.

Chu Hongyi was clearly capable of rescuing his clansmen. Yet, he decided to remain indifferent without doing anything.

His actions had indeed angered the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

Although Chu Feng was very furious at what Chu Hongyi had done, Chu Feng did not attempt to teach Chu Hongyi a lesson. After all, what he decided to do was his own decision.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng turned around and waved at the air before him. With his wave, the blades that filled the sky all disappeared.

The Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen that were fixed to the sky also began to fall.

Upon landing, they immediately kneeled on the ground and began to kowtow and beg Chu Feng for forgiveness.

“What use is there in apologizing to me? You should be apologizing to them,” Chu Feng pointed at the tortured Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

“We were wrong, we were wrong. Milords, please be magnanimous and spare us,” the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen did not hesitate, and immediately began to kowtow and beg the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that they’d tortured earlier for forgiveness.

This scene not only shocked the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were tortured earlier, but it also shocked all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present.

They had truly never expected the arrogant and conceited Burnfield Monstrous Clan, the same Burnfield Monstrous Clan that had looked down on them, to one day be kowtowing to them and begging them for forgiveness, to do such a humiliating and lowly thing.

This caused the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that had grown accustomed to being beneath others to suddenly feel the reignition of a long-extinguished flame in their heart.

It was their sense of pride and confidence that they had long lost.

Those were things that they all had back in the day. Back in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they were individuals standing high and above.

However, after coming to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, after leaving the protection of their clan, they could only rely on themselves.

Faced with numerous people stronger and more ruthless than themselves, their pride was gradually dulled and replaced with a deep sense of inferiority.

However, today, Chu Feng had reignited the flame of pride and confidence in their hearts. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Scram. When you return, tell your clansmen that I, Chu Feng, will soon pay them a visit,” Chu Feng said.

Seeing that Chu Feng was willing to let them go, how could those Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen possibly dare hesitate? They immediately turned around and soared into the sky. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the distance.

“There is indeed a cultivation ground nearby. However, with the cultivation that you all possess, you will not be able to gain much by going there.”

“Chu Hongyi, did you really just bring our clansmen here and brave dangers for such a small amount of cultivation resources?” Chu Feng asked Chu Hongyi.

“The hell do you know? The abnormal sign that appeared in the sky earlier is most definitely the appearance of an extremely powerful cultivation resource,” Chu Hongyi spoke with absolute confidence.

“You’re talking about the lightning that appeared in the sky, right?” Chu Qing asked.

“Precisely,” Chu Hongyi said.

“I might as well inform you of this. The lightning that filled the sky was an abnormal sign caused by little brother Chu Feng’s breakthrough in cultivation,” Chu Qing said.

“What? An abnormal sign caused by a breakthrough in cultivation?”

“Impossible! How could a breakthrough bring forth such a powerful abnormal sign?” Chu Hongyi shook his head repeatedly. He had a face of utter disbelief.

“Humph, that could only mean that you are ignorant and inexperienced. What Chu Feng is trained in is the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. The abnormal sign brought forth by his breakthrough in cultivation would naturally be even stronger,” Chu Huanyu interrupted. He was speaking out for Chu Feng.

“Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?” Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all opened their mouths wide with astonishment.

This was especially true for Chu Hongyi. His expression became so very ugly. It was as if he had been fed feces.
