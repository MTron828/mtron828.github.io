Chapter 4645: What a Powerful World Spirit

The beautiful figure stunned everyone present, especially the men. Their eyes practically lit up. For a moment there, quite a few people salivated too.

Take the Asura Spirit World’s world spirit for example, not only did his blood-red eyes turn completely wide, but his saliva simply wouldn’t stop dropping from his widened mouth. No matter how he tried to wipe it off, it simply continued dribbling.

The reason behind that reaction was simply because the woman that had just walked out from the spirit formation gate was too beautiful.

The world of cultivation never had any lack of beauties, and most of those present were powerhouses who could have almost any women they liked. Yet, they had never seen someone as moving as the woman who had just appeared before their eyes.

Flawless would be the word to describe her.

It was impossible to pick any faults with her clear eyes, fair skin, and delicate facial features. On top of that, she had a pure disposition that made her feel like an inviolable individual, bringing sinful thoughts to one’s mind.

Yet, despite her air of innocence, she had a perfect figure too. Her long legs peeking out beneath her black feather dress, as well as her small feet, made men gulp.

Her every gesture and smile seemed to enrapture souls.

It was impossible to resist such a woman. Even other women found themselves getting seduced by her.

“Where did Chu Feng find such a beautiful world spirit? Even fairies wouldn’t come close to matching her.”

The crowd muttered amongst themselves. Some of them even went to the extent of berating him.

“That fellow must be a licentious bastard from the Holy Light Galaxy! How else could it be possible for all of his world spirits to be girls, not to mention, each of them is more beautiful than the previous!”

Despite the huge uproar, there was no one who was more excited than Chu Feng at this very moment.

When he saw that familiar figure appearing before his eyes, his heart thumped so hard that it was almost going to escape from his chest. Even his body had started trembling ever so slightly. He even wondered if he was dreaming at the moment.

The woman standing before him right now was the person whom he had seen innumerable times in his dream, Milady Queen.

Boom boom boom boom!

All of a sudden, the dueling ring began shaking once more.

As if another sun had risen into the sky, a brilliant light suddenly engulfed the whole dueling ring. It was so blinding that no one was able to see what was happening on the dueling ring.

Fortunately, the light swiftly faded. However, as soon as the light vanished, an overwhelming burst of black aura suddenly rose up into the air like massive dragons soaring around. They spilled out from the dueling ring and rose into the sky.

As it turned out, the blinding light came from the formation on the dueling ring. It was the activation of the formation that compelled the release of this black aura.

The black aura swiftly congregated together to form huge swathes of clouds in the sky, blocking off the sky. It created quite a bizarre contrast—the sky was utterly dark, yet the earth was still radiating light.

It was almost as if someone had flipped the sky and the earth over. It was eerie and shocking.

“Is this a phenomenon caused by that female world spirit?”

The crowd on the spectator stand felt deeply conflicted looking at the sight before them. They had seen plenty of phenomenons before, but none had shaken their hearts as much as this.

Earlier, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit had induced a phenomenon when he appeared too, but compared to what was happening right now, the earlier phenomenon was like a small stream stand before a massive ocean, the difference between a small rock and a mountain!

And this difference was what that pierced their heart the most.

They could still remember how gleeful they were when the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit induced a phenomenon earlier on, and their earlier reactions were coming back to bite them right now.

“Oh hoh, this young lass over here is even more formidable. You must have quite an identity back at the Asura Spirit World, right?”

The phenomenon Eggy had triggered shocked not just the crowd from the Nine Souls Galaxy but the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit too.

He eyed Eggy licentiously while wiping off his saliva.

Yet, Eggy paid no heed to that Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit at all. Her eyes were instead focused on Chu Feng. Or to be more exact, from the moment she appeared, her eyes had never left Chu Feng despite the huge crowd looking at her.

As for Chu Feng, it went without saying that his eyes were focused on Eggy too. He was simply too excited to see Milady Queen once more.

There were so many words he thought he would tell her when they reunited, but for some reason, he found himself utterly speechless at this moment. All he could feel was a lump in his throat, stifling his words.

He was trying his best to control his emotions at the moment.

Chu Feng wasn’t a shy person, and he rarely lost control of his emotions. Even when he was standing before people who were far stronger and more influential than him, he had never been so discomposed before.

Other than his parents, the only one who could leave him in such a state was probably only Eggy.

“Why are looking at me foolishly, not saying a word at all? Do you not recognize me anymore?” Eggy placed her little hands behind her back as she asked Chu Feng with a smile.

Her smile was so sweet and beautiful that the crowd couldn’t help but grit their teeth at Chu Feng.

How wonderful it would be if that smile could have been directed at them!

“What nonsense are you speaking? Even if everyone in the world doesn’t recognize you anymore, there’s no way I wouldn’t. If there was no one here, I might have just done something overboard to you right now,” Chu Feng replied with a mischievous smile.

“Surely not? Are you getting intimidated just because there’s a crowd here? That doesn’t sound like you at all,” Eggy egged him on cheekily.

“I’m not worried about how others view me. I’m just afraid that... you’ll hit me. If you promise not to hit me, I don’t mind doing it right here right now,” Chu Feng said.

“Well, that’ll depend on how overboard you’re going to be,” Eggy replied.

Shoosh!

Right after those words were spoken, Chu Feng suddenly shot forth toward Eggy with open arms before pulling her into his embrace.

“Is this considered overboard?”

Chu Feng buried his face into Eggy’s long hair as he asked her softly.

“Bastard, are you trying to strangle this Queen? Loosen your grip!” Eggy berated as she struggled in Chu Feng’s hug.

Chu Feng was simply exerting too much force that even outsiders could tell that he was on the verge of crushing her little waist. However, it was also apparent that if Eggy really wanted to break free, Chu Feng would have already been sent flying off by now. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After all, she was the one who blocked the attack from the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit earlier.

“This is too much! How can they flirt in public? Are they trying to kill us, single men, with envy? Chu Feng, you lousy perv! Can’t you consider the feelings of your brothers here?” Xia Yan berated in displeasure.

And her words echoed the feelings of almost everyone present.

It was obvious that those two were flaunting their love for one another publicly, as if to incur the ire of the crowd.

There was no one who wouldn’t be interested in hugging a woman as beautiful as Eggy, yet Chu Feng was doing what the rest of them couldn’t right before their eyes, as if showing off to them. How could they possibly stand that?

And the first one to come to the limits of his tolerance was the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit.

“Hey, that young lass dressed in black dress. Are you blind? How is that trash worthy of you? You should get together with me instead. Only a real man like me is worthy of you!” the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit hollered.

Yet, Eggy didn’t even bother sparing him a glance at him, as if he was invisible.

“You harlot! Are you trying to feign deaf here?”

After being ignored by Eggy so many times, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit finally lost his patience. He tossed aside his previous disguise and revealed a ferocious face.

Once again, he released his oppressive might.

“Since you’re asking for it, don’t blame me for...”

Uwaaaa!

Before the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit could even finish his words, he had already let out a cry of agony.

The crowd quickly turned their eyes over, only to be shocked by what they saw.

Without even looking at the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit, Milady Queen swiped her hand. A surge of black aura morphed into a claw that darted forth to grasp the neck of Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit tightly before lifting him up to midair.

The arrogant Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit immediately withered, and he desperately struggled to break free of the claw made out of black aura. However, no matter how he thrashed about, it was futile.

And what was even more shocking was that this attack had actually revealed Milady Queen’s cultivation. Just like Yu Sha, she was at rank one Martial Exalted level.

Yet, she actually easily curbed the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit just like that.

While everyone was overwhelmed by the sight, the Wretched Black Demon remarked excitedly, “The ability to overwhelm stronger opponents. What a formidable world spirit!”

Those words brought a bout of realization to the crowd. As it turned out, Milady Queen had the ability to overcome opponents a rank stronger than her!

Due to that, she was able to curb the rank two Martial Exalted level Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit.

Nevertheless, that didn’t lessen the astonishment of the crowd as well.

After all, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit was no pushover. Everyone had witnessed his formidable fighting prowess earlier. Yet, he was left completely helpless in Eggy’s hand.

If so, how powerful could she possibly be?

“You harlot! Do you take me to be a weakling?”

All of a sudden, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit let loose a howl. His body began to emit blood-red aura, which fused together with his black aura, creating an eerie mixture of crimson and darkness.

At the same time, the cultivation of the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit began rising from rank two Martial Exalted level to rank three Martial Exalted level too!

“As expected of the legendary Asura Blood Tribe! Truly formidable!”

This sight excited the crowd from the Nine Souls Galaxy, and even those from the Gongsun Clan were cheering loudly.

Gongsun Yuntian also sneered coldly, as if everything was within his expectations.

They hadn’t lost just yet.

Uwaaa!

However, when another cry of agony sounded, the excited faces of the crowd and those from the Gongsun Clan froze in place before slowly warping into horror.

The cry of agony had come from no other than the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit. The claw of black aura was still grasping his neck tightly, not loosening in the least.

Even with his cultivation rising to rank three Martial Exalted level, he was still unable to withstand Milady Queen’s might.

At this very moment, everyone turned their eyes to look at Milady Queen. Their eyes flickered in awe and shock.

She was actually able to rival an opponent two ranks stronger than her!
