Chapter 3132 - Target Me Alone

Chapter 3132 - Target Me Alone

There were countless people that had Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Even those among them that trained in the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique numbered quite a few .

However, there was currently no one in the Ancestral Martial Starfield that trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

However, one such person actually appeared before their eyes. With this, how could the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen not be astonished?

That said, what astonished them the most was the fact that Chu Feng had not only trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, but had also grasped such heaven-defying secret skills that were actually capable of granting him a level of heaven-defying battle power.

At that moment, everyone from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan realized that the Chu Heavenly Clansman that had suddenly appeared before them was no simple individual.

“You’ve just entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, right?”

At that moment, even the expression of that rank eight Heavenly Immortal had changed. He no longer attempted to rashly attack Chu Feng, and instead began to question him.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng said.

“What is your name?” That rank eight Heavenly Immortal continued to ask.

“I am proud of my name and stand by my actions. I am Chu Feng,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng?” Hearing Chu Feng’s name, the expressions of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts changed somewhat.

They were arranging the memories in their minds and carefully trying to remember any information regarding Chu Feng. Unfortunately, they were unable to recall anything about him.

They had never heard of the Chu Heavenly Clan having someone called Chu Feng.

“The Chu Heavenly Clan has truly concealed you well,” Suddenly, an older individual from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan spoke with a cold laugh.

“What do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“Are you not someone that the Chu Heavenly Clan has secretly nurtured?”

“Otherwise, how could we have never heard of you before?” That man asked.

“Never heard of me before? I doubt that’s the case,” Chu Feng smiled lightly.

“We have truly never heard of you before,” That rank eight Heavenly Immortal spoke with a mocking laugh.

Following that, the other Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen around that rank eight Heavenly Immortal also started laughing.

Their laughter was filled with mockery.

“Oh?” Faced with their mockery-filled laughter, Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he said, “Have you all heard of Chu Xuanyuan?”

“Chu Xuanyuan?” Once Chu Feng brought up that name, the expressions of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts immediately changed.

Very few people in the Ancestral Martial Starfield did not know about Chu Xuanyuan.

After all, he was someone who once shook the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. Even now, tales of his accomplishments had been passed down with praise by many people.

When Chu Feng brought up the name ‘Chu Xuanyuan’, they suddenly recalled the matter about Chu Feng.

Wasn’t Chu Xuanyuan’s son called Chu Feng?

“You are Chu Xuanyuan’s son?” The Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts asked with astonishment.

“Precisely,” Chu Feng answered.

“Impossible. Wasn’t it said that you’d died long ago?”

They were astonished upon hearing Chu Feng’s answer. After all, they’d heard that Chu Xuanyuan’s son had died long ago. That was the reason why they did not associate Chu Feng with Chu Xuanyuan’s son right away.

“I am evidently alive. Furthermore, I’ve been living pretty well,” Chu Feng spoke with a faint smile.

“This...”

After verifying Chu Feng’s identity, all the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan were astonished.

After being astonished, they turned their gazes to that rank eight Heavenly Immortal.

Originally, they were determined to make Chu Feng pay for his actions.

However, upon finding out that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan’s son, they began to hesitate.

To be exact, they were slightly afraid.

Who was Chu Xuanyuan? They had heard about him, and knew very well who he was. In fact, when mentioning Chu Xuanyuan’s name, the majority of their clan’s seniors would reveal fear and reverence.

In the eyes of many people, Chu Xuanyuan’s life was akin to a god’s life. The reason for that was because what he had accomplished were things that were impossible for mortals to accomplish.

Seeing Chu Feng revealing his strength, they were already extremely surprised at how someone as young as Chu Feng was capable of such unimaginable abilities.

However, upon finding out that Chu Feng was actually Chu Xuanyuan’s son, they were no longer surprised by Chu Feng. Instead, they felt that what Chu Feng was capable of was only to be expected. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After all, Chu Xuanyuan was also someone who trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

Moreover, not only was Chu Xuanyuan himself extremely outstandingly powerful, but his father, Chu Hanxian, was also a heaven-defying genius whose name had shaken the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Thinking about it, how could Chu Hanxian’s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan’s son, be an ordinary individual?

For someone like him, he would astonish the world with a single brilliant feat.

To become enemies with someone like that was something that they needed to consider carefully.

As such, after the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen found out who Chu Feng was, they began to feel slightly afraid.

“Humph, just because you’re Chu Xuanyuan’s son, you dare commit such outrages?” That rank eight Heavenly Immortal asked coldly.

Compared to his clansmen’s change in attitude, he was still looking at Chu Feng with killing intent in his eyes, killing intent which had increased upon finding out who he was.

“You all know very well what sort of behavior your clansmen are capable of. Thus, I am disinclined to argue with you all as to who is right and wrong in what happened here today.”

“I have also not stayed here for the sake of arguing with you all. Instead, I stayed because there is one thing that I need you all to understand,” Chu Feng said.

“Oh?” Hearing those words, that rank eight Heavenly Immortal lightly smiled. He asked, “Why don’t you tell me what it is that you want us to understand?”

“The person who made your Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen kneel on the ground is I, Chu Feng, alone.”

“Thus, I hope that you all will target me alone should you wish to obtain revenge for them, and not implicate my clansmen,” Chu Feng said.
