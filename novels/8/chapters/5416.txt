Chapter 5416: Hidden

Feng Ling looked at Chu Feng with an ambiguous smile and remarked, “Young master Chu Feng, you really aren’t an ordinary person. It’s no wonder…”

Her words suddenly trailed off at this point.

“No wonder what?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s nothing,” Feng Ling replied.

It was getting increasingly apparent that there was something off about Feng Ling.

Weng!

Chu Feng wanted to ask more about it, but the surroundings suddenly turned dark as another flood of spirit power rushed out. Having already lost the strength he had gained from his talent, he could only watch helplessly as he was devoured by the spirit power.

Fortunately, the spirit power soon scattered.

Chu Feng found himself returning to the Blackwither Forest, and Feng Ling was right beside him. The enigmatic black crystal had also been teleported over with them and was floating not too far away.

Looking at the black crystal once more filled the two of them with an irrepressible desire to possess it.

“Young master Chu Feng, I am very fond of that crystal. Won’t you give it to me?” Feng Ling asked.

“Miss Feng Ling, I’m afraid that is impossible. I am also fond of the crystal too,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

How could Chu Feng possibly give up on the crystal just like that when he knew that there was something special about it? Besides, he was entitled to the black crystal given that he was the one who had cleared all three of the trials!

“I guess there’s no choice then.” Feng Ling raised her hand and pulled the black crystal over with her martial power.

Chu Feng immediately stepped in to stop her.

Boom!

The world suddenly trembled, and Chu Feng found himself frozen on the spot, unable to move at all. He looked at Feng Ling in astonishment as he exclaimed, “Miss Feng Ling, you…”

A powerful oppressive might had sealed his movements, and it was coming from none other than Feng Ling. She was actually a rank five Half-God level cultivator! On top of that, she wasn’t releasing the white aura she did earlier, which meant that this was her base cultivation.

If she could raise her cultivation by another three ranks on top of that, that would mean that she was comparable to a rank eight Half-God level cultivator! Who could have thought that she was actually this powerful?

“You hid your cultivation,” Chu Feng pointed out.

“Yes, I deceived you,” Feng Ling replied honestly.

“Why did you lie to me? Who are you? How did you find out about the remnant? What’s the use of the black crystal?” Chu Feng dropped a load of questions.

“You sure have a lot to ask, but I don’t feel like answering your questions right now. Don’t worry, you’ll know in due time who I am. We should meet again soon. I ought to thank you for your help today. I owe you a favor. Here, take this. You should be able to treat your friend with this.” Feng Ling tossed Chu Feng a pill before leaving the area.

The oppressive might that had bound Chu Feng dissipated with her departure.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Chu Feng took the pill and inspected it. He noticed that it contained an aura similar to the Black-feathered Specter, and it did hold the power to lift the curse.

“Chu Feng, could Feng Ling be the Black-feathered Specter?” Eggy asked.

“It doesn’t feel like it, but I suspect that she’s related to the Black-feathered Specter. I was caught off guard by how powerful she was,” Chu Feng remarked.

“Is she a junior?” Eggy asked.

“I can’t tell, but she felt like a junior to me,” Chu Feng replied.

“She’d truly be incredible if she’s still a junior.”

“That’d be an understatement.”

A junior who could reach that level of cultivation had to be a prodigy amongst prodigies. Few in the vast world of cultivation could compete with her.

“What should we do now? Should we head back into the remnant and continue exploring the place?” Eggy asked.

“We can’t head back in. The remnant has closed,” Chu Feng replied.

He noticed that the natural energies had faded from the Blackwither Forest, and the entrance formation was nowhere to be found.

“Could it be because its most important treasure has been taken away? Drats, it’s that black crystal, right? I knew that we should have killed her!” Eggy exclaimed.

Given how powerful the remnant’s master was, the ultimate treasure within it had to be something formidable too. While they were unsure what powers the black crystal harnessed, it was clear to both Chu Feng and Eggy that it was anything but ordinary.

The black crystal ought to have been Chu Feng’s, given that he was the one who cleared the trials, but Feng Ling snatched it over. How could Eggy not be angry about it?

“Forget it. Let’s return first.”

Chu Feng felt indignant too, but there was nothing he could do about the situation anymore. Thus, he decided to return to Li Wu’s residence.

He examined the pill once more to ensure that nothing was wrong with it before entrusting it to Li Wu. Li Wu popped the pill into her mouth, and moments later, a black aura started to flow out of her body as if she was removing toxins from her body. Her complexion started to take on a red, healthy glow.

“Thank you.” Li Wu bowed to Chu Feng.

“How are you feeling, Miss Li Wu?” Chu Feng asked.

“I think my curse has been lifted,” Li Wu replied.

“That’s wonderful!” The one who was the most delighted about the situation was none other than Bai Yunqing. He turned to Chu Feng and said, “Big brother Chu Feng, I don’t know how I can thank you for this.”

Li Wu was in a much better mood after having her curse lifted. She even prepared a little feast for Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing to thank them for saving her life. After the three of them had their fill, she announced that she was going to leave this place.

Bai Yunqing quickly asked her where she was heading, but she replied that she was unsure about it. This left Bai Yunqing a little crestfallen, as he was afraid that he would never be able to meet Li Wu again.

“Miss Li Wu, here is my address. Please feel free to look for me.” Bai Yunqing wrote down his address and gave it to Li Wu.

However, Li Wu waved her hands and said, “We’ll meet again if fate permits, but you might never want to meet me ever again.”

“That’s impossible. How could I never want to meet you ever again?” Bai Yunqing earnestly replied.

Li Wu smiled at his response before turning to Chu Feng. “Young master Chu Feng, I am truly grateful for your help. Please accept this as compensation. I think that it should be of some help to you.”

Li Wu passed an old wooden box over to Chu Feng.

The wooden box was only the size of half a palm, but there was a powerful sealing formation cast on it that even Chu Feng was unable to decipher.

“What’s that?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’ll open on its own accord in due time. You’ll understand when the time comes,” Li Wu said.

With those words, she took her leave. Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing departed from the forest too.

“Big brother Chu Feng, what did Li Wu give you?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“You can take it,” Chu Feng replied as he took out the wooden box and handed it over to Bai Yunqing.

“I can’t do that! How can I take something Miss Li Wu gave to you? I’m just curious about what it is,” Bai Yuqing replied.

“It’s fine. You take it.” Chu Feng threw the box over to Bai Yunqing. He wasn’t too curious as to what was inside it.

Weng!

Just then, the seal on the wooden box suddenly unraveled, and a flood of black aura gushed out from the wooden box.

Chu Feng’s eyes widened in astonishment.

The black aura carried a familiar aura—the aura of the Black-feathered Specter!

He suddenly recalled what Li Wu had mentioned earlier and murmured under her breath, “Could it be that…?”

Chu Feng quickly headed in the direction where Li Wu had departed, but he was unable to find her.

As a matter of fact, Li Wu hadn’t gotten far either. She had simply concealed her presence and was currently observing Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing from the sky. There was another woman standing beside her, and that person was none other than Feng Ling!
