Chapter 3387 - Raised Curve

Originally, the crowd were skeptical. However, upon inspection, and then another, they discovered... that it was really Tantai Changfei.

“Lord Elder, you...”

The Tantai Heavenly Clansmen started to panic. Tantai Changfei was the strongest expert of the Ice Summit, the person in charge of the Ice Summit. He was someone with a certain amount of status within the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

Who could dare to... attack him?

Who was it that dared to beat him up to such a state?

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, several more figures flew down from the entrance above and landed beside Tantai Changfei.

Upon seeing those people, the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen hurriedly kneeled on the ground.

While they did not recognize the people that had landed, they couldn’t possibly not recognize their Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder.

Likewise, they couldn’t possibly not recognize the World Spiritist Saint Cloak. Lastly, they couldn’t possibly not recognize the title plate of the Starfield Master Realm.

As such, they guessed that that individual was most likely Wuming Xingyun.

Seeing the enchanting beauty beside Wuming Xingyun, they recalled that renowned and extremely dangerous existence, the Queen Mother Fox Immortal.

Seeing the expressions of neglect toward Tantai Changfei displayed by those few individuals, the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen subconsciously felt that Tantai Changfei’s injuries might be related to them.

Suddenly, they recalled a punishment of their Tantai Heavenly Clan.

Whipping.

Furthermore, it just so happened that the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder was holding a long whip in his hand.

At this moment, the hearts of the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen shivered. In merely a split second, they were already shivering in fear. A feeling of things turning bad emerged from their hearts.

Merely, they did not understand why Tantai Changfei would be punished like that.

Confused, they turned their gazes to Chu Feng.

They thought in their hearts, ‘Could it be because of this brat from the Chu Heavenly Clan?’

Right at this moment, Wuming Xingyun, the Queen Mother Fox Immortal and that Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder had walked over to Chu Feng.

“Young friend, is this title plate yours?” Wuming Xingyun asked with the title plate in his hand.

‘Oh no!’ At this moment, the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen that were kneeling on the ground were all dumbstruck. They’d guessed correctly.

The reason why Elder Tantai Changfei was so severely punished was really because of that Chu Heavenly Clan’s brat.

Earlier... they were trying to kill him.

Thinking of this, they were so scared that they began to sweat cold sweat like rain, and drenched their clothes completely. They were so nervous that they felt that their hearts were on the verge of jumping out of their bodies.

“Senior, that is something that Lord Wuming Fenghuo gave me. I have something... that I needed senior’s assistance with,” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the personal letter from Wuming Fenghuo and handed it to Wuming Xingyun.

“This is indeed Fenghuo’s handwriting,” Wuming Xingyun out the letter away. Then, he looked to Bai Liluo on Chu Feng’s back, “You wish to have me help that small child undo her inverse seal?”

“Yes, senior, that’s right. Might senior be able to help me?” Chu Feng was still worried. After all, he was requesting help. Furthermore, he himself also knew that it would be very difficult to remove Bai Liluo’s inverse seal.

“Since it is Fenghuo who told you to come seek me, this old man will definitely give him face. Merely, that small child on your back seems to be very extraordinary,” Wuming Xingyun said.

“It’s not just that small child behind his back that’s extraordinary, this child himself is very extraordinary too, no?” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said as she looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.

It was only at the moment when Queen Mother Fox Immortal spoke that Chu Feng noticed that her gaze was very strange. She was using a special sort of observation technique.

She was, after all, a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Chu Feng might be able to conceal his cultivation from powerful martial cultivators, but he would not be able to conceal his cultivation from people with world spirit techniques much superior to his own.

Chu Feng knew that his cultivation has been seen through by that woman already.

At this moment, Chu Feng came to the conclusion that this woman was likely that Queen Mother Fox Immortal.

After Queen Mother Fox Immortal spoke, the gaze that Wuming Xingyun looked to Chu Feng with also changed.

Compared to the hidden inspection from Queen Mother Fox Immortal, Wuming Xingyun was inspecting Chu Feng openly, and in a very tyrannical manner.

At the moment when Wuming Xingyun’s gaze changed, Chu Feng felt that, apart from his bloodline power, everything else regarding him had been seen through by Wuming Xingyun.

“Quite an extraordinary child indeed. It would appear that the long-silent Chu Heavenly Clan will shake up the Ancestral Martial Starfield again.”

Upon discovering Chu Feng’s cultivation, Wuming Xingyun smiled and nodded. It seemed that even he was looking forward to Chu Feng revealing his talents.

Seeing that both Wuming Xingyun and the Queen Mother Fox Immortal were praising Chu Feng, the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder who stood beside them, though he was unable to determine Chu Feng’s cultivation, revealed a complicated gaze.

Even though he had no idea how much strength Chu Feng had concealed, he was certain that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation before him was definitely someone very remarkable.

It would appear that he had most definitely not obtained Wuming Fenghuo’s letter by chance.

“Young friend, let us talk elsewhere.”

After Wuming Xingyun finished saying those words, he brought Chu Feng with him and disappeared.

Following them, the Queen Mother Fox Immortal and the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder also disappeared. Of course... Tantai Changfei, who was punished and seriously injured by whipping from the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder, had also been taken away.

Even that opened entrance to the Fire Palace was closed.

At this moment, only the people that were originally in the Fire Prison remained.

The kneeling Tantai Heavenly Clansmen finally stood back up and heaved a sigh of relief.

Even though they’d made an enormous blunder, it seemed that their Supreme Elder was not planning to make things difficult for them.

However, they were unable to keep themselves from feeling lingering fear. They began to ponder exactly who that Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation might be for him to be able to startle that many grand characters. Even someone like Tantai Changfei ended up in such a miserable state after offending him.

However, they did not notice that the old man that was casually knocked flying by them earlier was actually not unconscious.

He had seen everything that had happened. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Furthermore, at this moment, the corners of his lips were raised into a curve.

No one knew exactly what he was smiling about.
