Chapter 5780: Don’t Want to Die? Beg Me!

“Young master, are you giving it to them just like that?” Huangfu Jiangyao and Huangfu Shangyang dragged their wounded bodies to Huangfu Shengyu’s side.

“What else? Do you two useless things want me to break my promise?” Huangfu Shengyu glared at the two of them.

“My apologies, young master. We underestimated our enemies.”

The two of them were apologetic.

“You didn’t underestimate your enemies. You were simply too weak. You would have lost again if I gave you a second chance.” Huangfu Shengyu glared at them in disdain.

Huangfu Jiangyao and Huangfu Shangyang lowered their heads, knowing that they had lost fair and square. They weren’t confident they could subdue their opponent even if they were given a second chance. Feng Ling and Yuwen Yanri were indeed formidable opponents.

Chu Feng and the others made their way to the chest. It was time for them to open it now that they had the keys in hand.

“Brother Chu Feng, why don’t you do it?” Xianhai Shaoyu passed the two keys to Chu Feng.

Instead of receiving the keys, Chu Feng asked with a smile, “Are you able to decipher it?”

The chest was huge, and it was covered in beautiful inscriptions that hinted as to how one should open it.

“I can only decipher some of it, which is why I’m passing the keys over to you. You should be able to tell what you have to do, right?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“I do,” Chu Feng replied as he took the two keys.

He had been examining the chest earlier, and he knew the correct way to open it.

Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao came closer too. They had examined the chest too and deciphered some of its secrets, but they hadn’t figured out the right way to open it yet. They knew that Chu Feng’s world spiritist technique was above theirs, so they were curious to know how he would go about it.

Before everyone’s eyes, Chu Feng first placed a key into the left keyhole, before placing the other key into the right keyhole.

Boom!

A pillar of dark purple light surged upward and fused into the ancient hall, cloaking the walls in its powers. The spirit formation gate was sealed, preventing anyone from entering or leaving the ancient hall.

Terrifying killing intent suffused the room, making everyone tremble. It was a powerful slaughter formation that could easily obliterate them. Should this slaughter formation activate, they would all be goners.

Sensing the prowess of the slaughter formation, the prodigies frowned.

However, Huangfu Shengyu burst into laughter, saying, “Chu Feng, I thought you’re a skilled world spiritist. Is this all you’re capable of? Look at what you did. You’re dragging the rest of us down with you.”

He was trying to rally the crowd against him, but it was futile. Not a single person spoke up against Chu Feng.

“You already lost your chance. You have no say over what my big brother wants to do,” Little Fishy sneered.

“Xianhai Yu’er, do you really think your big brother is invincible? Can’t you tell that he’s screwing us over now?” Huangfu Shengyu asked.

“And that’s none of your business,” Feng Ling scoffed.

“Yes, it’s none of your business,” Xian Miaomiao agreed.

“You should shut your trap,” Little Fishy sneered.

Huangfu Shengyu was speechless. He had nearly forgotten that everyone present, with the exception of Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao, was fiercely loyal to Chu Feng. It was no exaggeration to say that they were his harem.

“Very well!” Huangfu Shengyu clenched his teeth.

“Don’t worry, this slaughter formation is bound to be triggered. We can dispel it by pulling out of the keys, but the chest will vanish. However, there’s a way to open the chest without triggering the slaughter formation, and I’ll try it if you trust me,” Chu Feng said.

“What nonsense are you spouting? Of course, we trust you,” Xian Miaomiao said.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Indeed. You don’t even need to ask the rest. It’s not as if they can beat us, anyway,” Little Fishy said imposingly.

Chu Feng chuckled. He first twisted the left key clockwise thrice, followed by the right key anti-clockwise twice. Then, he twisted the left key anti-clockwise four times…

He continued twisting the two keys for a while, changing the directions and number of rounds every single time.

Initially, the crowd thought that it was a normal world spiritist maneuver. Most of them could tell that there was a trick to it and that this was the correct way to go about it. However, they soon fell dumbfounded when Chu Feng repeated the steps over a hundred thousand times.

Every step was different from the last. It was one thing to do it hundreds or thousands of times, but to do so over a hundred thousand times was insane. One would need to have an incredible memory and discerning eyes.

“It’s no wonder I couldn’t decipher it. I would have never thought it was this complicated,” Jie Baobao told Ling Xiao via voice transmission.

“That’s why I said the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has to accept him,” Ling Xiao replied.

Jie Baobao didn’t reply. She hoped that Chu Feng could join the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion too, but somehow, her gut feeling told her things wouldn’t go that smoothly.

Kacha! The chest opened.

A bundle of purple aura surfaced, but this purple aura was different from the power that had sealed off the ancient palace. It felt much more eerie and unfathomable.

The purple aura swiftly scattered and shrouded everyone present for a brief instant before it converged back to its original size.

Jip jip jip jip!

The purple aura began to tremble intensely. It emitted a sinister noise along with a terrifying killing intent.

Chu Feng rushed forward and placed his hand on the purple aura. Little Fishy, Xianhai Shaoyu, Ling Xiao, and the others hurriedly did the same too. They had felt the purple aura inspecting their entire body the moment it shrouded them, and that gave them an idea as to how they had to deal with the current situation.

All of them had to join hands and use their respective bloodline powers to curb the purple aura.

“Huangfu Shengyu,” Long Chengyu called out.

The three Huangfus didn’t make a move, and they had no intent to do so either.

“Don’t look at me. Xianhai Yu’er said earlier that this has nothing to do with us,” Huangfu Shengyu sneered.

“Now is not the time to be saying all that. You were shrouded by the purple aura too, so you have to participate in it as well. Otherwise, the slaughter formation will activate and take all of our lives,” Qin Xuan said,

“We aren’t afraid of death. If you are, you can try begging me. Xianhai Yu’er?” Huangfu Shengyu said.
