Chapter 3119 - What’s Going On?

Accompanying the voice, a figure appeared before the crowd.

To be exact, it was not only a single person that appeared. After that voice was heard, everyone in the Chu Heavenly Clans’ territory walked out from their palaces and soared into the sky. They followed after the man who spoke earlier, and walked toward the direction where Chu Feng and the others stood in an aggressive manner.

The person who had insulted Chu Feng and his father was a middle-aged-looking man who was close to three hundred years old.

He was the person that Chu Feng had detected to be the strongest among the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present.

He was that rank three Heavenly Immortal.

Furthermore, judging by the appearance of things, he should not only be the person with the strongest cultivation, but he should also be the leader.

“Big brother Hongyi, little brother Chu Feng, he...” Seeing that man walking over aggressively, Chu Ping immediately realized that the situation was bad. He rushed forth and tried to explain for Chu Feng.

“Chu Ping, I am speaking with him. Why are you butting into our conversation?” That man called Chu Hongyi glared at Chu Ping in annoyance.

Chu Ping knew very well what sort of temperament Chu Hongyi possessed. Seeing that Chu Hongyi had changed his target to him, it meant that Chu Hongyi was determined to make things difficult for Chu Feng. Chu Ping knew that if he were to continue to involve himself in the matter, even he would end up suffering alongside Chu Feng. Thus, Chu Ping immediately stopped talking.

“Big brother Chu Hongyi, it’s been a long time,” however, after Chu Ping grew quiet, Chu Shuangshuang stood forth.

“Shaungshuang, the two of us can chat later. Right now, I must teach this newcomer how to conduct himself in this place,” Chu Hongyi spoke coldly.

Seeing that, Chu Shuangshuang hurriedly smiled and stood to the side. She said no more.

That said, compared to Chu Ping, who was worried for Chu Feng, Chu Shuangshuang was not worried in the slightest.

She knew very well what sort of character Chu Feng was, and what sort of strength he possessed.

For Chu Hongyi to pick a quarrel with Chu Feng, the one that would end up suffering would be himself.

Even earlier, when Chu Shuangshuang stood forth to talk to Chu Hongyi, she was doing so for Chu Hongyi’s sake.

However, that Chu Hongyi did not appreciate her kindness. As such, she felt there was no need to continue to try to stop him.

After all, she knew very well that her purpose in being there was mainly to protect Chu Feng. As for Chu Hongyi’s life and death, it was none of her concern.

Chu Hongyi had no idea what Chu Shuangshuang was thinking. He also did not know what sort of person Chu Feng, who he was attacking, was.

Thus, after shouting down Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Hongyi turned his gaze to Chu Feng. He said, “What’s this? Are you mute? Or could it be that you’re so cowardly that you can only let others speak for you, that you do not even have the courage to speak for yourself?”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Hongyi turned to the others and laughed, “The son of Chu Xuanyuan is actually this useless.”

Once he said those words, the crowd present all started laughing. At the same time, they all cast mocking gazes at Chu Feng.

Facing the crowd’s laughter, Chu Feng’s lips were raised slightly to reveal a smile.

Seeing that Chu Feng was actually smiling, Chu Hongyi and the others were all baffled.

“What are you smiling about?” Chu Hongyi narrowed his sharp brows and asked coldly.

“You said that I do not know the rules, and do not respect my elders?” Chu Feng answered with a question.

“Are you not?” Chu Hongyi spoke coldly.

“If it wasn’t for me taking into consideration that you’re a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, you...” Chu Feng pointed to the group of people behind Chu Hongyi, “... and you all, would all not be standing in the sky. Instead, you would be lying on the ground and kowtowing to me, begging me for forgiveness.”

“Impudent! You are but a mere member of the younger generation, who gave you the courage to dare speak to us in such a manner?!”

“That’s right! Big brother Hongyi, you must properly teach this rascal a lesson!”

Before Chu Hongyi could even say anything, Chu Feng’s words immediately brought about the dissatisfaction of Chu Hongyi’s henchmen.

One by one, they clenched their teeth and glared at Chu Feng with glowering eyes. They seemed to want to devour Chu Feng alive.

With his lackies being dissatisfied with Chu Feng’s behavior, Chu Hongyi grew even more complacent. He pointed at Chu Feng and said, “You pig-headed fool, if I do not teach you a proper lesson today, I will not be able to uphold order here.”

“Oh. I’d urge you to reconsider your decision. Otherwise, you will no longer be able to uphold order here,” Chu Feng said.

“Courting death!” Chu Hongyi burst into a sudden rage. With a thought, boundless oppressive might swept forth toward Chu Feng.

When Chu Hongyi’s rank three Heavenly Immortal-level oppressive might was sent forth, the people that were hoping for Chu Hongyi to teach Chu Feng a lesson all began to smile complacently.

They felt that since Chu Hongyi had unleashed his oppressive might, Chu Feng would end up being ruthlessly oppressed like a dying dog.

“Wuuahh~~~”

The next moment, a scream was heard.

When the crowd reacted to the scream, the smiles on their faces instantly froze.

They were astonished to discover that Chu Feng was standing in midair, completely unharmed. However, Chu Hongyi had fallen to the ground. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

An enormous power was suppressing him deep into the depths of the ground. He was unable to move in the slightest.

“What’s going on?” The crowd were all puzzled. As Chu Feng’s oppressive might was only targeting Chu Hongyi, the crowd was simply unable to sense Chu Feng’s aura. As such, they did not know what was happening.

Moreover, it never crossed their minds that it was Chu Feng’s oppressive might that had crushed Chu Hongyi deep into the ground.
