Chapter 4966: Sima Xiangtu

The 136 formation nails were made out of 136 different materials, combined together to form 136 types of formations. Every single one of them was unique.&nbsp;

Despite the cruel exterior, the nails were supplying gentle energy to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, nourishing his body. Even though he was trapped in place, he wasn’t in a feeble state at all. If anything, he was more energized than ever.&nbsp;

“Brother Yuankong, you should have seen everything that has happened earlier, right? You do have a good eye for disciples. That disciple of yours… has already surpassed his master,” Master Yin Ren told the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

It turned out that he was aware of Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s relationship all along.&nbsp;

“Did you get afraid with just that? Then you’ll have much more to look forward to. That disciple of mine possesses true capabilities. It’s no use even if you choose to kneel down and beg for mercy now. Chu Feng won’t let you off,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.&nbsp;

It turned out that Master Yin Ren was Sima Xiangtu, a friend of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist while they were still juniors.

The two of them were talented world spiritists, and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist used to harbor unreserved trust for Sima Xiangtu. However, as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist became the strongest world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, envy started breeding in the heart of Sima Xiangtu.

When the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had a life-and-death duel with Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, Sima Xiangtu made use of the opportunity to feed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist a bowl of poisoned soup, causing the latter to perform worse than expected and lose to Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.&nbsp; Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Everyone thought that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist died in that battle, and Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted naturally became the most powerful world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.&nbsp;

As for the culprit, Sima Xiangtu, he left the Ancestral Martial Galaxy for the Nine Souls Galaxy under a new identity.&nbsp;

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been searching for Sima Xiangtu over the years, and he finally found clues about the latter’s whereabouts. When he parted ways with Chu Feng at the Dragon Clan back then, his goal was to look for Sima Xiangtu.

He did manage to achieve his goal.

The only problem was that Sima Xiangtu was no longer the same person he used to be. He had become much stronger. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist fell in defeat and ended up becoming a captive to Sima Xiangtu.&nbsp;

Sima Xiangtu used his eyeball as a confinement formation, bringing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist everywhere he went and allowing him to see everything that was going on.&nbsp;

“Brother Yuankong, you have changed. You weren’t such a braggart before. A mere brat who could only frantically flee from me a moment ago; did you think that I would be afraid of someone like that?” Sima Xiangtu asked.

“You’re only saying that because you don’t understand Chu Feng. He’s unlike those young masters of reputable clans. As long as there’s a breath left in him, the one who will eventually die is indubitably his enemies.&nbsp;

“Sima Xiangtu, you have infringed on his reverse scale. Nothing can save you anymore. The countdown on your life has started,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke confidently, as if he could already see a guillotine hanging above Sima Xiangtu’s head.

“You’re right. It would be troublesome if I gave Chu Feng time to grow. He could potentially become a threat. However, with how sentimental Chu Feng is, once he learns that his master is in my grasp… don’t you think that he will feel obliged to make a move?” Sima Xiangtu asked with a devious smile.&nbsp;

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist wasn’t worried at all.

“Chu Feng will come to save me, but that fellow doesn’t fight a losing battle. You may use me as bait, but you ought to pray hard that he doesn’t come. If he does, the one who will suffer is you,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Trying to scare me? You’re really looking down on me if you think that you can intimidate me with such words.&nbsp;

“Brother Yuankong, you should know how valuable your and Chu Feng’s souls are to me. You don’t have to worry; I don’t plan on killing your disciple. I can’t be bothered to use you to lure him in right now either. He can’t escape from my grasp anyway,” Sima Xiangtu said with a confident smile.&nbsp;

“Heh…”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into laughter. Despite being trapped by Sima Xiangtu, he showed no fear.

“What do you need their souls for?” Princess Xiaoxiao suddenly asked.

He sensed that both she and Xian Miaomiao were just tools for Master Yin Ren too.

“Young lass, he cultivates a unique skill that requires the tribute of high-quality souls. Did you naively think that he’s here to treat your affliction? All he’s doing is to strengthen your soul so that you would be of greater use to him,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.&nbsp;

“You’re intending to use my soul to cultivate?”&nbsp;

Princess Xiaoxiao stared at Sima Xiangtu in horror.

“Indeed. It’s such a pity that your Nine Souls Sacred Clan doesn’t have too many people who are useful to me. Many people in your clan are doomed to die,” Sima Xiangtu said.

“Our Nine Souls Sacred Clan has treated you well. Why are you doing this? Do you still have a conscience?” Princess Xiaoxiao roared angrily.

Sima Xiangtu only laughed in disdain.

“Conscience? What can conscience do? If your father had a conscience, he wouldn’t have become the clan chief. Your Nine Souls Sacred Clan is far dirtier than I am. I doubt that even you, Princess Xiaoxiao, haven’t really done much good in the world yourself. Since we’re all just using each other, what’s the point in talking about meaningless morals and principles?” Sima Xiangtu said.&nbsp;

He grabbed Princess Xiaoxiao and placed her into the confinement formation trapping the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. The formation then contracted back into the form of an eyeball, and he popped it back into his eye socket.&nbsp;

By this point, it was impossible for anyone to tell that the eyeball was actually a confinement formation.

…&nbsp;

Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the others had appeared elsewhere. It was the Divine Deer who had brought them there.

“Elder, I’m begging you. Please lend me your strength. I need it just this once. As long as you aid me in saving Princess Xiaoxiao, I’m willing to do anything you ask of me,” Chu Feng said.

He had been begging the Divine Deer for a while now. The latter had only brought Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, and Daoist Niantian with him, leaving Princess Xiaoxiao behind.

Putting aside his ties with Princess Xiaoxiao, Xian Miaomiao’s life was now tied to her as well. He couldn’t just leave them to the lurch.&nbsp;

The problem was that they didn’t have the strength to stand against Master Yin Ren now, unless the Divine Deer was willing to lend its unfathomable power to Chu Feng.

“Brat, I’m already being magnanimous by saving you, but you’re still demanding more? Why don’t you ask me to get rid of that old man for you instead?” the Divine Deer spat in displeasure.

“Elder, I…”

Chu Feng was unwilling to give up just like that, but the Divine Deer wasn’t willing to listen to his justification.

“Brat, get your own position clear. I only chose to save you because you have some talent in you. I’m doing this out of goodwill, not obligation. I have no reason to save that woman. If you treasure her and wish to protect her, do it yourself. I don’t have that much time to bother with your personal affairs.&nbsp;

“Also, I ought to remind you that my trial for you is soon approaching. If you aren’t able to grow to a level that satisfies me, it would only mean that you’re unworthy of my strength. If so, I’ll be finding someone else,” the Divine Deer said.&nbsp;
