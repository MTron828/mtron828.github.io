Chapter 5815: The Only Opportunity, the Disappearing Copper Gate

Even Little Fishy looked incredibly excited.

“Ahhh, is this for real? Is this the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation?” Feng Ling shrieked out of sheer excitement as she shook her fists.

Chu Feng had never seen them so excited before.

“It’s no wonder you advised us to come here, Chu Feng. To think that the hidden land is the legendary Immemorial Land of Dao Creation. Heavens! I don’t know how I can even begin to thank you. You are my benefactor!”

“Young hero Chu Feng, you are my benefactor too. I’ll never forget your grace. I’ll tell my children, grandchildren, and all my descendants about the favor you have shown me!”

The other two juniors from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion were so excited that they planned to worship Chu Feng as their ancestor. All this while, they had been worried that they would drag down Chu Feng, but this completely changed their viewpoint.

“May I ask what’s the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation?” Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.

“Ah? You don’t know about the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation?” The crowd was stunned.

Even Little Fishy was taken aback, though her lips soon curled into a smile as she thought that this was an interesting turn of events. “All of you keep quiet. Let me explain it to big brother.”

Through Little Fishy’s explanation, Chu Feng finally understood why everyone else was so excited.

There were records of the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation in ancient remnants that described it as a sacred land of cultivation in the Immemorial Era. Those who entered its premises had a chance to create their own cultivation dao, and they would receive guidance if they succeeded.

From then on, their road of cultivation would be different from the others. Those who succeeded in the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation eventually rose to the top in their respective eras.

However, it was difficult to enter the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation.

In the earlier years of the present era, there were many remnants containing methods and treasures to enter the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation, but they could only be used once, regardless of whether the individual succeeded or not. As a result, they were swiftly used up, such that the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation had become a myth by this point.

There were records detailing the phenomenon one would see when the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation opened, and it was identical to the scenery they were witnessing right now. That was how the others realized it was the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation.

“That explains why the Nine Heavens’ Zenith indicated this was an opportunity not to be missed.” Chu Feng was overjoyed. The crowd had come here at his advice, so he would have felt conscience-stricken if they had made a wasted trip.

The opportunity had been presented to them; it was up to them to make or break it.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re amazing. It’s such a pity. It would have been great if this phenomenon had appeared in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, so that it could be witnessed by the entire world,” Long Chengyu exclaimed.

“You can flaunt it afterward too,” Chu Feng replied jokingly.

“Brother Chu Feng, you don’t understand. Of the known methods and treasures, there were records of some allowing two people to enter the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation at once in the Ancient Era, but by the present era, all of them were for individual entry. It is unprecedented for so many people to be allowed into the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation at once. We’re making history here!” Long Chengyu exclaimed.

His words evoked a sigh from Long Muxi.

“It’s indeed a pity. If only more people could witness it,” Qin Xuan remarked as well.

“I doubt others will be able to witness it even if it happened in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. We’re currently under the effects of a powerful concealment that not even the strongest experts in the world could see through,” Chu Feng said.

“Is that so?” Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan looked a bit less regretful now.

“Does that mean we’re the only ones to challenge the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation other than the elders in the earlier years of the present era?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s hard to say,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Oh?” Chu Feng asked.

The others also looked at Xianhai Shaoyu, though their eyes were filled with skepticism. Based on what they had heard, only a few top-notch figures in the earlier years of the present era had entered the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation, and even fewer of them had succeeded.

“There are many ways to enter the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation. Most opportunities had been consumed in the earlier years of the present era, but I have heard about an ancient copper gate that allowed anyone to enter the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation as long as they could open it. This copper gate had been through several hands before falling into the hands of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion tens of thousands of years ago. However, there are rumors that the copper gate went missing decades ago,” Xianhai Shaoyu looked at Ling Xiao as he spoke.

“Went missing?” The others turned to Ling Xiao too.

In truth, most of them had heard about the copper gate, and they thought Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao might know the truth behind it since they were from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have guarded the copper gate with the highest level of security given how valuable it was, so it was unthinkable for it to have gone missing.

“Brother Shaoyu, this matter should have been contained within the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. How did you learn about it?” Ling Xiao asked.

“Did it really go missing? How did such a valuable treasure go missing?” Long Chengyu, Qin Xuan, and the others bombarded Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao with questions.

“I have heard about this matter, though I am not sure about the details. The copper gate is the only known treasure left in the world that leads to the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation, so it should go without saying how important it was. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has placed it under the tightest protection ever since coming into possession of it. Yet, it suddenly vanished decades ago. What’s weird is that the defensive formation is completely intact, so it looked more like the copper gate had vanished into thin air rather than it had been stolen,” Ling Xiao said.

“Vanished? Why would it suddenly vanish?” The crowd was perplexed.

“Could there be a timer to the copper gate? After tens of thousands of years, a formation inside the copper gate activated and teleported it away,” Long Muxi guessed. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“That’s possible. It’s not uncommon for such treasures to possess sentience. It might have been teleported into one of the remnants,” Qin Xuan said.

The others nodded in agreement too.

“I’m guessing that the defensive formation primarily serves to prevent others from taking the copper gate away. If so, is it possible someone has slipped inside the defensive formation and activated the copper gate on the spot instead of taking it away?” Xianhai Shaoyu suggested.

“Ah?”

The crowd was startled, but Ling Xiao chuckled at that conjecture.

“Many powerful experts in the earlier years of the present era had tried to open the copper gate but to no avail. I doubt that someone in the current era will be able to do so.” Ling Xiao turned to Chu Feng and added, “I’d think Chu Feng could have pulled it off, but he was still an infant decades ago, right?”

“Indeed. I also think it’s unlikely for anyone to have pulled it off since even the powerful cultivators in the earlier years of the present era had failed.” Long Chengyu, Qin Xuan, and the others expressed their agreement.
