Chapter 2619 - Cut The Weeds And Eliminate The Roots

At this moment, Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng and the others were currently traveling back to Hero City.

Due to the fact that Ying Mingchao’s injuries were still not completely healed, Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi were still continuing to heal Ying Mingchao’s injuries.

With the situation being like this, it became the task of the several True Immortals from Hero City to drive the crowd, hastening their traveling speed.

Although this was still the allied army, their numbers and grandeur were much less compared to when they had arrived.

Furthermore, perhaps it might be because they had failed in their crusade against the Infant Soul Sect, but the crowd members were all very downcast.

At the same time that they felt gloomy, they were also furious. Curses toward those that had betrayed them were being heard from the crowd nonstop.

“Who is it?!”

Right at this moment, Ying Mingchao, who was concentrating on healing his injuries, suddenly opened his eyes and looked ahead.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, as expected from Ying Mingchao, your perception is still this sharp.”

“However, it must be thanks to that Chu Feng that you were able to heal to such a state in such a short period of time, no?”

An eerie voice sounded. Then, a figure appeared. That person stood in front of the allied army.

It was only a single person. However, this person dared to confront the entire allied army.

Most importantly, when faced with this individual, everyone from the allied army revealed alarmed expressions.

The reason for that was because this person was the person that had defeated Ying Mingchao earlier, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

“What do you want?” Someone from the allied army asked with a shivering voice.

“What I want? Don’t you all know very well what I want? How can I allow people like you all to leave like this?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Naturally, I have come to find you all so that I can eliminate you completely so as to not leave any future trouble,” the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster said with cold laughter.

“Sure enough, that was all a plot?” Chu Feng asked.

“Since you’ve already managed to see through it, why bother asking? That said, Chu Feng, I am someone who cherishes talent. As long as you hand over that stone dyed with the Divine Dragon’s blood to me, not only will I spare your life, but I am also willing to take you into our Infant Soul Sect so that you can enjoy the glory, splendor, wealth and rank together with us,” the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster said to Chu Feng.

“Stone dyed with the Divine Dragon’s blood? He’s talking about the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler?” Chu Feng’s heart tightened upon hearing those words.

The Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler was the treasure that Chu Feng had obtained from Grandmaster Kai Hong’s remnants. It was a stone dyed with the Divine Dragon’s blood.

Originally, Grandmaster Kai Hong had wanted to forge it into an Ancestral Armament. However, he had failed in doing so.

Chu Feng never expected this Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster to actually know about the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster had no idea what Chu Feng was thinking about. Seeing that Chu Feng was hesitating, he thought that Chu Feng might give it up. Thus, he asked again, “Chu Feng, are you willing?”

“I am truly sorry. While I, Chu Feng, dare to do anything, I do not dare to wallow in the mire with someone like you who is inferior to even animals. I am afraid I will receive the wrath of Heaven should I do that,” Chu Feng mocked.

“Since that’s the case, you can go and die together with them,” as the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster spoke, he revealed his Ancestral Armament.

At the same time, he also revealed his rank two True Immortal-level aura without the slightest restraint. Like an invisible tornado, it moved to engulf the entire allied army.

“Come, as if we’re afraid of you!” Zi Xunyi shouted. She too unleashed her oppressive might.

Even though Zi Xunyi managed to block the oppressive might unleashed by the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, she was still pushed back two steps.

Those two steps were caught by everyone. This caused the people from the allied army to feel even more uneasy.

After all, it meant that even though both Zi Xunyi and the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster were both rank two True Immortals, Zi Xunyi was simply no match for the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

“Xunyi, do not dirty your hand. It is better that you let me handle a shameless animal like him.”

Right at this moment, Ying Mingchao stood up and pushed Zi Xunyi behind him.

“No, Mingchao, you can’t. Your injuries...” Zi Xunyi wanted to stop Ying Mingchao.

Even though Ying Mingchao’s injuries had improved, he was still not completely healed. As such, she would naturally not be at ease to have him fight.

“Rest assured, without the help from that Infant Soul Sect bunch, he is simply no match for me.”

After Ying Mingchao said those words, his eyes turned dark green. He had unleashed his Divine Power.

Then, he held his Ancestral Armament in his hand and rushed toward to attack the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

The current Ying Mingchao simply did not appear like someone who was injured. Instead, he resembled an invincible warrior, a ruler who stood at the apex of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

“Heh, overestimating one’s abilities.”

Faced with the incoming Ying Mingchao, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster laughed mockingly.

Then, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster no longer held back either. He too unleashed his black gaseous flames and collided with Ying Mingchao.

“Chu Feng,” At this moment, Zi Xunyi looked to Chu Feng.

“Senior, let’s begin,” As Chu Feng spoke, he began to set up a grand spirit formation.

Seeing that Chu Feng understood her intention, Zi Xunyi also began to set up a grand spirit formation.

This was the same grand formation that Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi had jointly set up outside Chen Heavenly City to assist Ying Mingchao.

After all, Ying Mingchao’s intention was very clear. He stated that he was no match for the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster earlier only because there were so many people from the Infant Soul Sect supplying their strength to the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

However, in order to pull the wool over people’s eyes and not make those fools suspect him, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster had evidently come to eliminate them by himself.

While the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster no longer had the assistance of the people from the Infant Soul Sect, Ying Mingchao still possessed the assistance from Chu Feng and the others.

As long as Chu Feng and the others set up that grand spirit formation again, Ying Mingchao’s strength should, logically, be a tier above the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s. As such, Ying Mingchao should be able to win this battle.

This time around, Zi Xunyi and Chu Feng were not setting up their spirit formation within their bodies. Instead, they openly joined hands and set up the grand spirit formation directly.

As they were openly setting up the spirit formation, their speed became much faster.

In only a short period of time, they finished setting up the grand spirit formation.

“Buzz~~~”

Once they finished setting up the spirit formation, Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi immediately gathered everyone’s power and imbued Ying Mingchao with it using the grand spirit formation.

When Ying Mingchao received this power, his body once again started to shine with golden brightness. Like in the battle before, he once again gained the upper hand.

“Ying Mingchao, did you really think that I would not be able to defeat you without the assistance of everyone from the Infant Soul Sect?”

That said, even though the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was now at a disadvantage, he was not scared in the slightest. Not only that, but he even had a mocking smile on his face.

That’s right, it was an extremely mocking smile. He was not only mocking Ying Mingchao, but he was also mocking Zi Xunyi and the others.

“What do you mean by that?” Ying Mingchao sensed that the situation was amiss from his words.

“Since I dared to come to take care of you all by myself, I would naturally possess certainty in being able to take care of you all.”

“Buzz~~~”

Right after the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster finished saying those words, a dagger appeared in his previously empty left hand.

It was a golden dagger. The dagger did not appear to be extremely sharp. The reason for that was because dragon-scale like veined patterns filled the dagger.

However, once that golden dagger appeared, the aura of the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster immediately increased by several times. In an instant, it surpassed Ying Mingchao’s aura.

“That is?”

Ying Mingchao and the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster were fighting in close range; they were less than three meters away from one another.

Thus, when Ying Mingchao saw the golden dagger, his expression immediately changed. A deep sense of unease emerged in his eyes.

“Woosh~~~”

At the moment when Ying Mingchao noticed the specialness of that dagger, the dagger let out a golden light.

That golden light shot straight toward Ying Mingchao’s right shoulder. The speed was too fast. Before Ying Mingchao could react, his right shoulder had been penetrated by the golden light.

Then, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster suddenly waved his hand and blood splattered everywhere. Ying Mingchao’s right arm that he was holding his Ancestral Armament with was sliced off.
