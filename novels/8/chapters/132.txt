MGA: Chapter 133 - Poisoned

Although the palace that Su Rou was living in was not big, it was very exquisite. The decorations within the palace were quite unique and grand. As fragrance was emitted everywhere in the palace, one could tell that it was the residence of a girl in an instant.

“Young master Chu Feng, please drink some tea. This is fragrant tea of the highest quality and the second lady specially asked me to prepare it for you.” The servant served a pot of tea.

“Thanks!”

Chu Feng ate quite a bit of food and drank quite a bit of wine in the feast. At that moment, tea was something that Chu Feng needed. The fragrance of the tea was very special and there was an indescribable attraction.

“Ha~~Nice tea.”

Chu Feng finished the cup of tea with one gulp but he still felt thirsty. So, he raised the entire pot of tea and poured it into his mouth. After finishing the entire pot of tea, he still wished for more as he wiped his mouth and said, “Where is the second lady?”

“The second lady said she is waiting for you on the top floor.” The servant smiled and said.

“Oh? I need to go up?” Chu Feng felt that it was a bit strange. Why did she invite him yet not personally welcome him? Instead, he needed to go up himself to find her?

However, after some more careful thinking, Chu Feng could understand it. Although Chu Feng was a guest in the Su family, at the end, Su Rou was an elder in the Azure Dragon School. No matter if it was on the topic of identity or strength, she was above him so it was normal for him to look for Su Rou himself.

Thinking to that point, Chu Feng started walk up the stairs. The servant smiled strangely, closed the door to the palace and silently left that area.

The palace had 5 floors and Chu Feng was slowly walking up. When he walked to the second floor, he felt that something was wrong with his body. His body felt burning hot and he felt waves of “evil fire” coming from under his stomach. Looking over, a small tent was raised up.

“Damn! What is happening?!” Chu Feng was a bit speechless. He quickly straightened his long robe up and covered up his reactions. Or else, if Suoru saw it, he would certainly be labeled as a rogue.

Chu Feng continued upwards. However, when he arrived on the third floor, his bottom part swelled more and more. That made Chu Feng very uncomfortable. Although he was at the prime of youth and a pole sticking out was normal, it was the first time that it was so tough.

“Damn it. This isn’t right. Was there some huge supplements in the feast that stimulated my male nature?”

Chu Feng was aware that something was off and that he was not in his normal state. At that moment, his neck was thick and red. The blood in his body was boiling as if some obscure fire lit his entire body on fire.

That obscure fire was the “evil fire”. It filled the brain with desires and made people want to do things between males and females. If it was not vented out, it would harm the body.

“It seems that food really cannot be eaten randomly.”

Chu Feng was a bit anxious and he quickly revolved the spiritual energy within his body to suppress the evil fire within his body. It had to be said that the power of spiritual energy really was wonderful. With that, it really did have some effect.

Feeling that his boiling desires were controlled, only then did he dare to continue going upwards. However, when Chu Feng arrived on the fourth level, a wave of fragrance suddenly floated in from the fifth floor.

The fragrance seemed to be from a certain flower and it caused people to be lost within it. Chu Feng could not control himself and he was attracted to it. He quickened his footsteps, but just as he walked onto the 5th level, Chu Feng heard water splashing sounds and steam pounced towards his face.

At that instant, Chu Feng panicked. He subconsciously thought of a possibility. Although it was the first time that he experienced that scene, it seemed to be a woman’s bathing place.

“Crap.”

Just at that time, Chu Feng suddenly discovered that his spiritual energy was quickly dissipating. In a flash, he lost all his spiritual energy as if his cultivation was sucked dry by someone. It was like his cultivation gained from the many years all vanished.

If it was a normal situation, perhaps Chu Feng would calm himself and find the reason why his cultivation disappeared. However, Chu Feng at that instant completely panicked because the desires suppressed by his spiritual energy madly surged out. It was even several times stronger than before.

At that moment, his desires slammed towards his brain and Chu Feng felt that he was going to lose his rationality soon. He subconsciously prepared to leave that place or else he felt that something horrible would happen.

*bang clank* As he panicked, Chu Feng accidentally knocked a porcelain vase over. Although it did not break, it still made a clear sound.

“Who?” Just at that time, a sharp yet sweet female voice abruptly rang out. It was Su Rou.

“Don’t come over!” Chu Feng subconsciously yelled because just by hearing Su Rou’s voice, he could not endure it. Who knew what he would do when he saw Su Rou who was like a fox-spirit.

[TN: In Chinese legends, fox-spirits that transformed into humans were usually extremely beautiful.]

“Chu Feng, it’s you?” After hearing Chu Feng’s voice, Su Rou clearly relaxed and lowered her guard. After water splashing sounds sounded out, light footsteps quickly followed.

At that instant, Chu Feng wanted to leave, but when he saw the alluring figure within the steam, he couldn’t help but stop his movement. Then, he cast his gaze that was densely covered with evil fire straight towards that beautiful figure. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Su Rou stepped out of the steam. She had a white towel covering her body and her seductive body was outlined. Her snow-white shoulders and legs were all revealed.

Her wet, long hair scattered along her shoulders and drops of water were on her slender, soft, and smooth skin as they slowly flowed down. Beautiful. Beautiful to the extreme. No matter if it was her fox-like face or her devil-like body, with a glance, lust would break out,

“Chu Feng, it really is you. Why have you come here?” Although Su Rou did not expect Chu Feng there, she still charmingly smiled and thousands types of elegance were manifested. Chu Feng’s final consciousness collapsed when he heard that soft and sweet voice.

*whoosh* If it were others, it would be hard to control themselves when they saw Su Rou like that. No need to mention Chu Feng who was engulfed by that evil fire. He spread out his arms, stepped with his legs, and with a frog-like jump, he threw himself onto the beautiful Su Rou.

“What are you doing!”

Seeing Chu Feng leaping towards her, Su Rou’s face instantly lost all colour and felt that something was amiss. She wanted to dodge, but she discovered that there was not a single ounce of Profound power within her body. Although she could see Chu Feng’s actions with her eyes, her body could not react to it.

“Ahh~~~”

A sharp cry rang out and Su Rou fell on the ground. She was pushed down by Chu Feng and at that instant, Su Rou’s snow-white complexion instantly reddened. Her fox-like, charming big eyes were staring at Chu Feng and her gaze was filled with shock and fear.

She could feel that Chu Feng had something that was fiercely jabbing on her body. Facing that situation, naturally, Su Rou could think what was happening.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing, get up!”

As she lost herself from the fear, Su Rou wanted to push Chu Feng away but it was useless as she could not use any strength. Her soft and smooth hands rubbed Chu Feng’s body and it made Chu Feng’s desires even stronger.
