Chapter 3729 - Mirror Core

With the help of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng managed to successfully fuse with the Fire Qilin Talisman.

Through the power of the Fire Qilin Talisman, Chu Feng was able to increase his cultivation by a level.

Although this was only effective whilst his cultivation was still that of an Exalted, this served as an enormous help to Chu Feng.

After helping Chu Feng fuse with the Fire Qilin Talisman, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist continued to treat his injuries.

As for Chu Feng, he continued to establish a space in his soul so that he could fuse with his Divine Power.

Since Chu Feng began the preparation of fusing with his Divine Power, seventy-eight days had passed.

On that day, Chu Feng had finally succeeded. He had managed to establish a new space in his soul.

“Senior, what is this junior supposed to do for the third step?”

Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were both standing and facing each other in the palace hall.

After recuperating for the past days, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had completely recovered.

As for Chu Feng, although he was very weak, he had a look of excitement all across his face.

Having finished the second step, he was finally able to start on the third step.

Although he didn’t know what the third step would be, he had learned from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist that fusing with a Divine Power had a total of four steps.

That was the reason why Chu Feng was so excited. After all, he was getting closer and closer to fusing with the Four Symbols Divine Power.

“Chu Feng, your body is now very well-prepared.”

“However, you need to know that Divine Power is a power that conflicts with your Heavenly Bloodline.”

“Thus, if you want to fuse with your Divine Power, you must create a new dantian.” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Create a dantian?”

“Senior, is the space established in my soul for containing that new dantian?” asked Chu Feng.

“Precisely.”

“The method to create a new dantian is recorded here. Have a look yourself.”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he tossed a scroll to Chu Feng. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chu Feng caught the scroll and immediately opened it.

However, after reading it, Chu Feng’s shining eyes immediately dimmed.

If Chu Feng’s dantian was destroyed, he would be able to restore it instantly.

Even if the dantian of his soul was damaged, he would still be able to heal it.

However, if he must construct a new dantian, and one that could fuse perfectly with his soul, it would be a very difficult task.

The difficult part would be creating the dantian.

Chu Feng must use his own soul to create the second dantian.

However, if Chu Feng wanted to create a dantian, he would not only need to focus, but he would also have to spend a long period of time.

According to the scroll, even if Chu Feng didn’t do anything else, even if he didn’t eat or sleep and focused on creating a dantian the entire time, it would still take him at least three hundred years.

To Chu Feng, three hundred years would be simply too long.

Besides, it was simply impossible for him to spend three hundred years creating a dantian and do nothing else.

“Senior, must it really take at least three hundred years?”

“Is there any other method?” Chu Feng asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“It will take at least three hundred years. There’s no shortcut.”

“That said, Chu Feng, the first, second and third steps are all only a matter of time. They are not hard at all for you.”

“Normally, the final step would be the hardest step.”

“When all the preparations are done, you must fuse with your Divine Power.”

“However, fusing with one’s Divine Power is the most difficult part. After all, it is no easy task to make a Divine Power recognize oneself.”

“That is, however, different for you. The Divine Power in your body has already recognized you. Thus, compared to others, the most difficult step is the easiest step for you.”

“Right now, you only needed to spend three hundred years to create a dantian.”

“Upon doing so, you’ll basically be able to fuse with your Divine Power and gain their power,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Chu Feng’s heart sunk upon hearing those words. He did not expect that he would still not be able to fuse with his Divine Power even after putting forth so much effort. Fusing with a Divine Power was much more difficult than he had imagined.

Chu Feng was not afraid of hardships. What he feared the most was spending a lot of time on something.

After all, he was different from other martial cultivators. He simply carried too many burdens on his shoulders. He simply had no time to waste.

Perhaps it was as Chu Lingxi had said. With the amount of time needed to fuse with a Divine Power, if Chu Feng was to spend that time training, who knew what his cultivation would increase to.

To spend all that time only to fuse with a Divine Power was evidently not worth it.

But, Chu Feng had promised the Four Symbols Sacred Beasts that he would turn them back into the Four Symbols Divine Power, and have them fight alongside him.

Thus, it was something that Chu Feng must do. However... it was also impossible for him to spend all his time on it.

Because of that, it became clear that it would be impossible for him to obtain the Four Symbols Divine Power in a short period of time.

“Senior, I have troubled you these past few days.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng bowed respectfully towards the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Even though he could not fuse with his Divine Power, Chu Feng firmly remembered the help the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had given him during this period of time.

Chu Feng was filled with gratefulness toward him.

“Boy, it’s strange for you to say something so emotional all of a sudden.”

“Tell this old man the truth, have you decided to save that old man trapped in the Mirror Core?” asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Judging from the timing of things, it was only half a day away from the seventy-ninth day limit set up by old man Zhu.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist knew that Chu Feng was going to set off to save him.

“Senior, if you were the one in danger right now, this junior would definitely come to your rescue too.”

“As for that senior Zhao, he has only fallen into such a dangerous place for the sake of helping this junior.” said Chu Feng.

“This old man has said everything that needs to be said. I know that I cannot persuade you. Since you insist on throwing away your life, you can go.”

“Just make sure to not blame this old man for not warning you if you really do die.”

“Now scram.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist waved his hand with his back facing Chu Feng. He was telling Chu Feng to leave.

That said, his voice contained a slight amount of disappointment.

The reason for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disappointment was naturally because he had tried to persuade Chu Feng against saving old man Zhu multiple times. However, Chu Feng was unwilling to listen to him.

Seeing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist like that, Chu Feng wanted to say something. After all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was only acting like that because he did not want him to throw away his life. He was considering Chu Feng’s good.

However, upon thinking a bit, Chu Feng did not know how to explain things.

Thus, Chu Feng merely bowed to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist again before turning around to leave.

After exiting the palace, Chu Feng found Grandmaster Liangqiu. Guided by Grandmaster Liangqiu, Chu Feng went straight for the depths of the Mirror Sea.

The Mirror Core was located at the deepest area of the Mirror Sea.

Not only must one keep diving doward, but one must also pass through the rock strata located on the seabed. One must pass through multiple layers of rock strata in order to reach the Mirror Core.

After a series of twists and turns, Chu Feng was finally able to see the so-called Mirror Core.

The Mirror Core resembled an enormous spirit formation gate floating in the boundless sea.

It was enormous, and covered an area of several tens of thousands of meters. It had an oval shape, and was slowly spinning and scattering light outward.

From a glance, it seemed like an empty space, and also seemed like an isolated world.

Most importantly, it had a certain amount of attractive force. The surrounding seawater was being sucked into the Mirror Core nonstop.

Neither Chu Feng nor Grandmaster Liangqiu dared to rashly approach the Mirror Core.

If they got too close to it, they would definitely be sucked into it.

If they were sucked into it, it would definitely be very difficult for them to escape from it.

In fact, not to mention entering the Mirror Core, merely at that depth, the pressure of the Mirror Sea was already extremely difficult to endure.

Grandmaster Liangqiu, who travelled there with Chu Feng, the rank one Utmost Exalted and Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, someone with far superior strength to Chu Feng in both martial cultivation and world spirit techniques, had a look of pain all over his face.

Even though he was enduring the pain and trying his best to conceal it, Chu Feng was able to tell that Grandmaster Liangqiu was unable to withstand the pressure at that depth.

From this, one could tell how dangerous of a place it was.

However, when compared to the Mirror Core, the danger of that place was simply unworthy of being mentioned.

Chu Feng knew that the Mirror Core, although beautiful, was an extremely dangerous place.

The reason for that was because its dangerous aura was fully emitted. Even from such a distance, Chu Feng was able to sense that dangerous aura.

The Mirror Core’s gate seemed like a gate to hell. If one were to enter, one would have a ninety percent chance of death.
