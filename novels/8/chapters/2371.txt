Chapter 2371 - Helping

“Chu Feng, this is bad, it seems that your world spirit key is unable to let you enter from the outside,” Seeing that there was no change to the world spirit key, Her Lady Queen spoke worriedly.

“It would seem that I can only go and ask the clan in charge of guarding the spirit formation to see whether or not they will be willing to let me in,” At that moment, Chu Feng was also feeling very helpless.

“But, what if they refuse to let you enter?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“If I am truly unable to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage, we can only go with the final option,” Chu Feng said.

“Final option? What is that?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“If I am unable to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage, it would mean that I will not be able to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. However, I must obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.”

“Thus, if I am unable to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage, I can only return to the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond and lie in wait there for Kong Zheng’s return, so as to ambush him and snatch the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone from him.”

“Merely...” As Chu Feng reached this point, he revealed a helpless expression in his eyes.

“Merely, if you want to defeat that Kong Zheng, you will have to utilize the power of the Evil God Sword. Right now, that Evil God Sword is extremely powerful. However, the more powerful it is, the more dangerous it is to you.”

“Even if you are able to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, you will likely suffer serious injuries yourself, and might even lose your life in the process. This is indeed the final option,” Her Lady Queen said.

“No, that’s not what I meant. Rather, ambushing Kong Zheng is what a lowly vile person would do. If not for a lack of options, I really do not wish to resort to that,” Chu Feng said.

“Since that’s the case, let’s go ask for help from the guardian clan. If Kong Zheng is able to enter, it would mean that the guardian clan is not absolutely inflexible.”

“As long as you present them sufficient amount of benefits and bribery, you might also be able to enter,” Her Lady Queen said.

“We can only try,” As Chu Feng spoke, he extended his hand and planned to retrieve his world spirit key.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right at that moment, the world spirit key started to change. It was flickering with a faint radiance.

As that light flickered, wave upon wave of spirit power began to spread in all directions, fusing with that enormous spirit formation.

At that moment, that impregnable spirit formation started to oscillate with the waves. Soon, a three meter-tall hole appeared on the wall of the Hundred Refinements Stage’s spirit formation.

It was an entrance, an entrance into the Hundred Refinements Stage.

“It’s a success! Chu Feng, that world spirit key is actually useful,” Her Lady Queen started to jump and hop in excitement. A sunshine-like sweet smile appeared on her exceptionally beautiful face. She was smiling so very happily.

The reason why she was so excited was because she knew that if Chu Feng was unable to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage, he would definitely have to go and find Kong Zheng. The reason for that was because Chu Feng would absolutely not ignore Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

Eggy did not care about whether or not ambushing Kong Zheng would be the doings of a lowly, vile individual. What she cared about was the fact that it would be difficult for Chu Feng to defeat Kong Zheng with his current strength.

If Chu Feng wanted to snatch the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone from Kong Zheng, he would have to utilize the Evil God Sword. However, the backlash from the Evil God Sword was no small matter. As such, Her Lady Queen did not wish for Chu Feng to brave that danger.

[1. But... doesn’t Eggy have a battle power on par with ordinary rank one Martial Ancestors? Wait... nvm. Kong Zheng = rank 6 HMA + 2 HMA with Armor + Wings + 3 HDBP... = on par with rank two Martial Ancestors...]

However, as that world spirit key was effective now, it meant that Chu Feng would no longer have to use his final option. As such, Her Lady Queen would naturally rejoice.

“Buzz~~~”

After an entrance was opened in the spirit formation, the world spirit key automatically drifted into the air and flew back to Chu Feng. It was as if the world spirit key knew that Chu Feng was its master.

“Thank you, you’ve helped me enormously,” Chu Feng held the world spirit key in his hand. Joy filled his heart.

“Chu Feng, go on in. That world spirit entrance will soon disappear,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded his head. Then, he entered through the world spirit entrance and arrived in the Hundred Refinements Stage.

Sure enough, right after Chu Feng passed through the world spirit entrance, it immediately closed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It returned to the same appearance as before; there was absolutely no difference at all. Even the defensive capabilities it possessed returned to being as impregnable as before. No one was able to tell that it had opened earlier.

“This is the Hundred Refinements Stage?”

After entering the Hundred Refinements Stage, Chu Feng would naturally properly survey the place. However, after surveying the Hundred Refinements Stage, Chu Feng was rather disappointed. The reason for that was because he discovered that the Hundred Refinements Stage was merely a dense forest; there was nothing special about it.

“Who is it? Show yourself.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s gaze grew sharp as he turned toward the southeast. As he spoke, he shot forth his palm. An enormous attractive energy immediately swept forth.

At that moment, violent wind erupted. The wind blew the sands about and moved the rocks. Even the enormous trees reaching over a thousand meters tall were shaking violently.

As such an enormous wind blew past, a figure appeared, drifting in the wind like a fallen leaf. In the end, that person landed before Chu Feng.

It was a man. He had a middle-aged appearance. However, he was actually several hundred years old already. As for his cultivation, it was pretty decent, he was a rank two Half Martial Ancestor.

Chu Feng inspected the man and then asked, “Are you a cultivator here?” The reason for that was because Chu Feng felt that this man did not resemble someone who grew up in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, nor did he resemble a member of the guardian clan.

“Yes. I am from the Elm Lower Realm. My name is Tian Yi,” The man replied.

“Are you familiar with this place?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am. I’ve been training here for close to a year now. I know this place very well,” That Tian Yi said.

“Then, do you know about the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone?” Chu Feng asked.

“Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone? You wish to obtain that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone?” Tian Yi asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng did not try to conceal it.

“I am able to bring you to the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. However, you must help me with one thing,” Tian Yi said.

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I can tell that you are not a cultivator from here, nor are you from the guardian clan. Yet, you were actually able to come into this place. This means that you are most definitely an extraordinary individual. If I am not mistaken, you should be a world spiritist, right?” Tian Yi asked.

“What sort of help do you want from me? There’s no harm in speaking frankly,” Chu Feng said.

“I hope you can help me treat a person. As long as you can cure her injuries, I will bring you to the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone,” Tian Yi said.

“What if I refuse to help?” Chu Feng asked.

“Then, even if you are to kill me, I would not tell you where the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is,” Tian Yi said firmly.

Seeing Tian Yi before him, Chu Feng’s gaze changed slightly. He was actually a bit moved.

He was able to tell that this man was not someone who was unafraid of death.

However, at that moment, he seemed to have really made the decision that if Chu Feng refused to help him, he would not guide Chu Feng even if Chu Feng were to kill him.

Chu Feng was not afraid that he would not show the way for him. After all, Chu Feng could find someone else to show him the way to the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone even if he refused to.

Actually, Chu Feng admired him. He admired the fact that he was willing to give up his life for someone else.

Likely, the person that he hoped Chu Feng would cure was someone very important to him.

“Show the way,” Chu Feng said.

“I said that if you don’t help me cure her, I will absolutely not show you the way,” Tian Yi said.

“I am telling you to bring me to her,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re agreeing to help?” Hearing those words, Tian Yi revealed an astonished expression.

“Go ahead and show the way.” Chu Feng said with a smile. His tone was very good-natured.

“Yes,” Seeing that Chu Feng had really agreed to help him, Tian Yi was overjoyed. He turned around and immediately began to lead the way for Chu Feng. They began to rapidly proceed toward the depths of the Hundred Refinements Stage.
