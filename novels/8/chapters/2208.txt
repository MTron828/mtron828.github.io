Chapter 2208 - The Descent Of A Crisis

“Really?” Chu Feng was overjoyed after hearing what Liu Chengkun said.

Naturally, he was overjoyed at the chance to be able to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

However, it was not because of the fact that he would become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, an extremely amazing existence, but rather because he would be able to treat Liu Chengkun’s illness after becoming an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

Should that happen, Chu Feng would be able to undo a knot in his heart.

“Of course. Tomorrow, I will invite you to the grand hall, and Lady Society President will publicly announce this matter,” Liu Chengkun said.

“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng felt very grateful. Even though he did not know about the details, he was able to guess that the invitation must have been very difficult to obtain. He knew that Liu Chengkun must’ve pulled a lot of strings to get that invitation for him.

After all... he was not a part of the Red Butterfly Society.

However, Chu Feng had no idea that Liu Chengkun had not managed to obtain the invitation for him.

“There’s no need to be this courteous toward me. Go on and rest yourself. I will personally come to get you tomorrow,” After Liu Chengkun said those words, he left.

“That old man treats you truly well. You should just join the Red Butterfly Society,” At that moment, even Eggy urged Chu Feng to join the Red Butterfly Society.

“Indeed, Senior Liu treats me extremely well. However, Eggy, you should know the reason why I do not wish to join any power,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s why I was just saying it. It’s a joke. Don’t take it to heart,” Eggy laughed mischievously.

However, at that moment, Chu Feng felt even more disconcerted. The more Liu Chengkun treated him well, the guiltier he felt for refusing Liu Chengkun’s invitation.

At that moment, in another area within the Red Butterfly Society.

Zhao Ruofan was not alone in his palace; his son Zhao Xuan and his grandson Zhao Xiao were also present.

“Grandfather, you are truly amazing. Lady Society President has just imprisoned, us yet you’ve already managed to get us out,” Zhao Xiao said with a smile on his face. The word ‘flatterer’ was written all over his face.

“So what if she’s the Lady Society President? Even she needs to consider the status of our Zhao Family.”

“After all, we possess backing from the Sunset Cloud Valley.”

“If it wasn’t for my distantly related cousin, the Sunset Cloud Valley would’ve already helped Luyang’s Pavilion eliminate our Red Butterfly Society,” Zhao Ruofan said proudly.

“Of course,” Zhao Xiao and his father nodded repeatedly. They were also very proud when their distant relative in the Sunset Cloud Valley was mentioned.

“Lord Father, I have heard that Lady Society President has spent a great amount of wealth to purchase two invitation title plates to Mount Cloud Crane.”

“Is she planning to go there with you?” Zhao Xuan asked.

“Truth be told, that girl Liu Xiaoli has already mentioned that matter to me before. Furthermore, she will announce this matter tomorrow,” Zhao Ruofan said complacently.

“Lord Father, you are amazing.”

“Congratulations grandfather.”

Zhao Xiao and his father continued to flatter Zhao Ruofan.

As for Zhao Ruofan, the smile on his face grew prouder and prouder. Ambitions unknown to others were flickering in his aged eyes.

However, right at the moment when the grandfather, son and grandson were feeling proud, an enormous crisis was quietly descending upon them.

At that moment, many warships were on the road from Luyang’s Pavilion to the Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters. It was an impressive display of manpower. They were currently hidden within the void, and proceeding rapidly toward the Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters.

On one of the gorgeous warships, the Luyang’s Pavilion’s Pavilion Master was in the same gorgeous palace that he had been in before.

However, his surroundings were no longer filled with beautiful women. In fact, he did not even dare to sit on the main seat.

The reason for that was because there were several tens of figures in the palace. These people were not wearing the clothing of Luyang’s Pavilion. Instead, they were wearing red clothes that shone with a sunset-like glow.

On their waists were a title plate. On the title plates were three words: Sunset Cloud Valley.

As for the old man leading the group, he had blazing red hair, a blazing red beard, and a body covered with a twilight glow. He looked like an immortal descending upon the world of mortals. As for his cultivation, it was unfathomable.

“Myself had heard that an abnormal sign would form should one master the Sunset Cloud Mysterious Technique to the pinnacle. In the past, I thought it was merely bragging. However today, upon seeing Elder Su, I am surprised to discover that it was actually true,” Chu Luyang spoke politely. [1. Myself is a humble way to refer to yourself.]

Chu Luyang was a very conceited person. However, when before this Elder Su, he did not dare to show any disrespect.

The reason for that was because he knew very well that the Chu Heavenly Clan would leave the fates of their members that they dispatched to train in the Lower Realms to the heavens. Even if they were to be killed, the Chu Heavenly Clan would not avenge them.

Merely, the great majority of people did not know about this. Furthermore, even if they did, they would not believe it to be true.

However, this Elder Su was different. Not only did he know about it, he also believed it to be true. Thus, when before Elder Su, Chu Luyang’s status as a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan was completely useless.

Before him, Chu Luyang was nothing more than a martial cultivator with a far inferior cultivation. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Perhaps he might be a supreme existence in the eyes of others, however, when before that Elder Su, he was nothing more than an ant.

“Pavilion Master Chu, truth be told, ever since the founding of our Sunset Cloud Valley, less than ten people have managed to master the Sunset Cloud Mysterious Technique to a state of producing an abnormal sign.”

“Other than our successive Valley Masters, our Elder Su is the only other person that has been able to master the Sunset Cloud Mysterious Technique to a state of producing an abnormal sign,” A two-meter-tall yet extremely thin old man began to flatter Elder Su.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that his appearance actually resembled Zhao Ruofan slightly.

“Elder Su is amazing indeed,” Chu Luyang continued to politely flatter Elder Su.

“Pavilion Master Chu, there is no need to continue with the flattery. This time around... since I have agreed to help you eliminate the Red Butterfly Society, I will definitely eliminate them for you.”

“Merely, Elder Zhao, is that information you received the truth? Are you certain that what you have is the location of the Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters?”

“You must know that I have no time to waste,” Elder Su, who was emitting an abnormal sign all over, questioned the extremely thin old man.

“Elder Su, please rest assured. I have a distantly related cousin. He is in the Red Butterfly Society, and holds the position of Vice President. It was him who personally informed me of the location of the Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters. There is absolutely no mistake,” The thin as a match Elder Zhao said.

“Very well,” Elder Su nodded.

At that moment, Chu Luyang had a joyous expression. He knew very well how powerful this Elder Su was. It could be said that Elder Su was the strongest existence in the Sunset Cloud Valley apart from the Valley Master.

Right now, Elder Su was willing to help him eliminate the Red Butterfly Society. In fact... he did not even have to use a single soldier. The people that he had dispatched with him today were nothing more than a display.

‘Chu Feng, you should also be in the Red Butterfly Society, right? I will let you know the consequences of offending me,’ Chu Luyang declared in his heart fiercely.

He knew that Chu Feng had left together with Liu Chengkun.

Even though Liu Chengkun had declared that Chu Feng was not a part of the Red Butterfly Society, Chu Luyang firmly believed that Chu Feng had joined the Red Butterfly Society, that the Red Butterfly Society was Chu Feng’s backing.

Right at that moment, a female’s voice was heard. “Pavilion Master Chu, I have a request. I don’t know if you might be able to help me with this?”

Chu Luyang turned his gaze around. It turned out that it was the little beauty Chu Feng had accidently come across while she was naked in the lake, Xu Yiyi.

“Miss Yiyi, what is your request, there is no harm in telling me about it. As long as I, Chu, am able to accomplish it, even if I am to go through water and tread on fire, I will definitely not refuse you,” Chu Luyang declared while patting his chest. He knew very well how special that Xu Yiyi’s status was.

The reason for that was because Xu Yiyi was Su Jingrui’s, Elder Su’s, personal disciple. Even though this girl was not very old, and her strength was inferior to his own, she remained someone that he dared not offend.

“There is no need for you to go through water and tread on fire. It is merely a small request. Can you spare that Chu Feng?” Xu Yiyi asked.

“Chu Feng?” Hearing those words, Chu Luyang’s expression immediately turned sluggish. His expression was as if he had accidently stepped into a pile of dog shit.

He had truly never ever expected that Xu Yiyi would be pleading for leniency for Chu Feng!!!
