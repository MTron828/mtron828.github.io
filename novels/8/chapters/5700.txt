Chapter 5700: Two Major News

“Nonsense! I can crush a junior like him as easily as crushing an ant!” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master sneered.

“Did you crush him when you confronted him today?” the mysterious power asked in a mocking tone.

The anger in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master’s eyes intensified.

“What are you? What’s your goal? Are you a remnant from the Ancient Era?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“The existence serves to revolutionize this era. Didn’t you enter my territory because you desire my power?” the mysterious power asked.

“Your territory? The entire Seven Realms Galaxy is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s territory,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Do you think you can evict me?” the mysterious power asked.

“You think that you can play me like a fiddle just because you possess some power. You don’t understand me, Jie Tianran, and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion at all,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

The mysterious power burst into derisive laughter. He didn’t have a high opinion of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

As the strongest man in the world of cultivation, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master couldn’t tolerate being mocked in such a manner. Thus, he thrust his palm and released a gush of spirit power.

The mysterious power, despite the divine aura it emanated, was dissipated by the gush of spirit power. Yet, the voice continued to speak, “Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, there’s nothing wrong with my guidance. The person who can bring unparalleled glory to your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has appeared. The choice is in your hands.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master gritted his teeth and sneered, “Are you pretending to be heaven’s will? Even if God’s Era truly exists, the one who calls the shots isn’t you but me! I won’t evict you from the Seven Realms Galaxy, but I’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death. No matter where you’re from, I’ll make you pay the price for your actions.”

The mysterious power didn’t respond to those words.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master made his way to the Sacred Mansion and entered a forbidden land that required the use of a special formation key.

Inside the forbidden land, 3003 world spiritists dressed in black world spiritist cloaks and black masks were waiting for him. All of them carried a token on their waist that read ‘Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’ in the front and ‘Sacred Mansion Shadow Squad’ behind.

“Paying respects to Lord Mansion Master,” the 3003 world spiritist greeted with a bow.

“Rise,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

Three of the world spiritists walked up to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. The three of them stood out from the others as their world spiritist cloaks were embroidered with the words ‘Beast Shadow’, ‘Ghost Shadow’, and ‘Monster Shadow’ respectively.

“Lord Mansion Master, are we to capture Chu Feng?” Beast Shadow asked.

“Capture? Do you have any leads?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

Beast Shadow fell silent as he had no lead.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master passed the scroll containing Chu Feng’s details to the Ghost Shadow World Spiritist and ordered, “Ghost Shadow, bring a thousand men to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy and investigate if the man named Chu Xuanyuan is dead. I want you to bring him here by hook or by crook, dead or alive.”

“Understood.” Ghost Shadow took the scroll before leaving with a thousand world spiritists.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master then took out another scroll and passed it to Monster Shadow.

“Monster Shadow, take the remaining men and protect the juniors listed on this scroll. I’ll say this first. If anything happens to these juniors, those who are protecting them will be executed,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Understood,” Monster Shadow accepted the edict before leaving with the remaining world spiritists.

The only ones left in the room were the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and Beast Shadow.

“Follow me.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master stood up, and Beast Shadow quickly did the same. The two of them rose into the air, and before long, they were already out of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Upon reaching outer space, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master took out a talisman paper and crushed it. He then looked into the distance, as if waiting for something.

Beast Shadow patiently waited behind the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, not daring to utter a word. All of a sudden, he narrowed his eyes. Someone was approaching.

A person dressed in a veiled bamboo hat and a gray cloak was flitting toward them from the distance. His hunched back suggested that he was an old elder. When he finally arrived in their proximity, he took off his veiled bamboo hat.

The revealed appearance was weird. His face was pitch black, and his nose and mouth were protruding. He looked like a hybrid between a human and a dog. However, his blood-red eyes looked terrifying.

“Daoist Heavensniffer pays respect to Lord Mansion Master and Lord Beast Shadow.”

“Daoist Heavensniffer, you have been loitering outside our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. You should know what happened to Chu Feng by now, right?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, I am already aware of it,” Daoist Heavensniffer replied with a nod.

“Capture Chu Feng on my behalf. I’ll give you what you want.” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master took out a Cosmos Sack and tossed it to Daoist Heavensniffer.

Daoist Heavensniffer opened the Cosmos Sack. It was filled with pots, bowls, and all sorts of miscellaneous items. These were the items Chu Feng had come into contact with during his time at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Daoist Heavensniffer took out the items one by one and sniffed them. He formed a hand seal, and his nose sniffed even faster. A peculiar surge of energy flowed out.

.

Two hours later, he revealed a look of dilemma.

“Lord Mansion Master, are these really the items Chu Feng had come into contact with?” Daoist Heavensniffer asked.

“They are,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

“I can’t sense his life force. If there’s nothing wrong with the items, Chu Feng is likely dead,” Daoist Heavensniffer said.

“Are you certain?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Lord Mansion Master, you also know how much I desire that item. I’d grasp any opportunity you toss my way, but I am really unable to sense Chu Feng’s whereabouts. You should know better than anyone else what I’m capable of. There’s only one possibility for people whom I’m unable to sniff out—they are dead,” Daoist Heavensniffer said.

“Was he unable to withstand the backlash from my master’s formation too?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master murmured.

There was a tinge of delight in his old eyes, but there was also a hint of regret as well.

…

Several days passed in a flash. Two major news swiftly spread in the world of cultivation.

The first news concerned Chu Feng. He was Jie Ranqing’s son, and he had caused a huge ruckus in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Other than the backward Eastern Region, there was no one in the world of cultivation who hadn’t heard of his name.

Chu Feng was able to escape from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but he had overexerted himself while channeling the overwhelmingly powerful formation that he died to the backlash.

Many people believed the veracity of this news.

The second major news was that there had been a rebellion in the Totem Dragon Clan.

Half of the Totem Dragon Clansmen had joined hands with honorary elder Taishi Xingzhong, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, and other subordinate powers to overthrow the previous Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

And the new Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was Long Lin.
