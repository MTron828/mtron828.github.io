Chapter 4946: An Affair Concerning Our East Region

“That fellow was too weak. I haven’t had my fun yet. I’ll give them another chance to send another junior at me. As long as they’re able to survive a single attack from me, I’ll leave this legacy formation here for them!” Situ Gouyue said.

“How arrogant,” Shengguang Baimei remarked.

“He’s arrogant, but he has the right to be so. Even Zhuge Feiluan wasn’t a match for him. I’m afraid that…”

Shengguang Buyu glanced at Chu Feng. He felt that not even Chu Feng would be able to withstand Situ Gouyue’s attack.

Situ Gouyue was simply too powerful.&nbsp;

Zhuge Feiluan’s world spiritist technique was top-notch in the entire eastern region of the world of cultivation, but he still lost by such a huge margin to Situ Gouyue.

In fact, even Shengguang Buyu wasn’t able to see through the complexities in Situ Gouyue’s earlier formation. Had it not been activated, he wouldn’t have known that Situ Gouyue’s white dragon formation was that powerful.&nbsp;

“Young master Gouyue, Feiluan is already the strongest junior of our Zhuge Clan. If even he isn’t a match for you, I fear that no one else is. We admit defeat,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“If your Zhuge Clan isn’t competent enough, you can look for someone else. Get the most talented junior world spiritist of your eastern region here. I’ve come from afar, so surely you don’t expect to send me off without allowing me to have my fun, right?” Situ Gouyue asked.

“Young master Gouyue, Feiluan is already the most talented world spiritist of our Nine Souls Galaxy,” another elder of the Zhuge Clan said.

“What? This fellow is the most talented world spiritist of your entire eastern region?”

Situ Gouyue was shocked.

“My gosh. It’s no wonder why everyone says that the eastern region is a gathering of weaklings and told me not to waste my time here. I was still harboring doubt, but it looks like that’s indeed the case. I’m utterly disappointed,” Situ Gouyue said disdainfully.

“Elder, let’s take away Situ Qi’s legacy formation. These weaklings don’t deserve to retain that legacy formation,” Situ Gouyue told the blue-cloaked woman.

His words were utterly humiliating, but not a single person from the Zhuge Clan dared to speak a word. The blue-cloaked woman also prepared to take the legacy formation away with her.

“Wait a moment,” a voice suddenly echoed.

The crowd was surprised.&nbsp;

Those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan were just slightly intrigued, but those from the Zhuge Clan were appalled. As for Princess Xiaoxiao and the others, they were horrified.

The one who had just spoken up was Chu Feng. He took off his cloak and revealed himself.

“Chu Feng? What are you doing here? Didn’t you already leave our Zhuge Clan?”

The crowd from the Zhuge Clan asked.

“I left, but I came back afterward,” Chu Feng replied calmly.&nbsp;

He turned to the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief and asked, “Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, didn’t you mention that the previous clan chief has told him to protect the legacy formation at all costs? That’s why you didn’t allow me to enter even if you have to break your promise to Master Yin Ren. What’s with your change of attitude then? Why are you giving up so easily?”

“…”

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan chief could only hang his head in shame. The other members of the Zhuge Clan sighed deeply as well.

They had done so much earlier on to stop Chu Feng from entering the legacy formation, but they ended up giving up so easily now. Their behavior of taking advantage of the weak and pandering to the strong was indeed shameful.

“Who are you?” Situ Gouyue asked.

“Ancestral Martial Galaxy, Chu Feng,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ancestral Martial Galaxy. This means that you’re from the eastern region too?” Situ Gouyue asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

“What do you intend to do by standing out? Do you wish to challenge me?” Situ Gouyue asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

Situ Gouyue’s interest was piqued. He was just about to say something when the blue-cloaked woman suddenly spoke up.

“Young master Gouyue, the Ancestral Martial Galaxy has already fallen into decline. It isn’t even on par with the current Nine Souls Galaxy. He won’t be a match for you. There’s no need to waste your time with the likes of him,” the blue-cloaked woman said.

Situ Gouyue’s interest immediately faded upon hearing those words. He looked at Chu Feng in contempt.

“You’re just a small fry? To think that even the likes of you dare to challenge me; you must be unaware of who I am. Scram. Get as far away as you can. Don’t sully my eyes with your presence.”

Situ Gouyue was just about to leave the palace when Chu Feng spoke up once more.&nbsp;

“You can admit defeat if you dare not face me.”

Situ Gouyue’s footsteps immediately stalled to a halt. He released a chilling aura that made it clear that he was angered.&nbsp;

“What did you just say? Why don’t you try repeating that once more?” Situ Gouyue asked with chilling eyes.&nbsp;

Not even the elders of the Zhuge Clan dared to look at Situ Gouyue, and the faces of their juniors paled. Yet, Chu Feng looked at him with a fearless smile.

“I said that you can just admit defeat if you dare not face me. There’s no need to come up with such meaningless excuses,” Chu Feng replied.

“Interesting. I wonder who gave an insignificant nobody like you such confidence,” Situ Gouyue asked.&nbsp;

“Naturally, my confidence comes from my strength,” Chu Feng replied.&nbsp;

“You sure are confident. Is this what they mean when they say that the ignorant are fearless? Very well. I have plenty of time on hand anyway. Since you’re willing to go this far, I’ll play with you. Just don’t blame me if I accidentally exert too much force and take your life, alright?” Situ Gouyue said.

His intention was clear. He was willing to accept Chu Feng’s challenge, but he wouldn’t hesitate to kill Chu Feng in the battle. Judging from his earlier means, it was definitely within his means to pull that off.

Even so, Chu Feng stood unfazed.&nbsp;

“Try it then,” Chu Feng said as he began heading toward the palace in the sky.

“Don’t go, Chu Feng.”

Someone suddenly grabbed Chu Feng’s sleeves. It was Princess Xiaoxiao. She had taken off her cloak to stop him.&nbsp;

“Chu Feng, there’s no need to do this. We can think of another solution,” Princess Xiaoxiao advised.&nbsp;

She thought that Chu Feng had stepped forward because he didn’t want those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan to take away the legacy formation. However, those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan were obviously no pushovers.&nbsp;

No matter how anxious Chu Feng was to save Xian Miaomiao, he shouldn’t leap straight into the face of danger.&nbsp;

“Chu Feng, forget it. The Situ World Spiritist Clan isn’t to be trifled with. They’re here for the Zhuge Clan; there’s no need for us to get involved.”

“Young hero Chu Feng, I don’t think that you know the Situ World Spiritist Clan well. It’ll be best not to get involved with them.”

Daoist Niantian and Shengguang Baimei sent voice transmissions to Chu Feng too. They were trying to persuade Chu Feng to step down.

“Brother Chu Feng, you mustn’t cross hands with him. You mustn’t…”

Another feeble voice sounded from the side. It was from Zhuge Feiluan. His face was completely disfigured, looking more like a heap of flesh and blood. It wouldn’t be surprising if he were to suddenly drop dead at this moment.&nbsp;

“Brother Feiluan, Princess Xiaoxiao, haven’t you heard what they said earlier on? They aren’t just looking down on the Zhuge Clan. They’re looking down on our entire eastern region! It’s no longer just the Zhuge Clan or Nine Souls Galaxy’s business anymore. It’s the business of our entire eastern region.”

Chu Feng shook off Princess Xiaoxiao’s arm and headed toward the palace. He stopped right in front of the entrance and looked at Situ Gouyue.

“Young master of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, as long as you dare to come in, I’ll show the prowess of our eastern region.”

With that, he stepped into the palace.
