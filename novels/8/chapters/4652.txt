Chapter 4652: Bad Predicament

It was fortunate that Eggy was protected by a layer of black aura covering her skin. Despite her unkempt condition, she hadn’t sustained any injuries at all.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng still rushed to her side anxiously.

“Eggy, how are you feeling?” Chu Feng asked anxiously.

“Dumbo, do I look injured to you? I’m fine, so stop worrying,” Eggy replied.

Seeing that Eggy was fine, Chu Feng’s wildly beating heart calmed down a little.

“Eggy, use this. It should be of some use to you.”

As he spoke, he took out a massive black saber and passed it over to Eggy. This massive balck saber was known as Death God’s Edge, and it was the world spirit equipment he had obtained from the Divine Armament Villa’s Heaven-reaching Armor Pagoda.

Back then, Chu Feng entered the pagoda together with Yin Zhuanghong, and the two of them were interested in the Death God’s Edge. It was just that obtaining it was no easy feat. For it, Chu Feng had gone through quite a bit of suffering.

Seeing the Death God’s Edge, a conflicted look suddenly flickered across Eggy’s eyes, such that her mood seemed to sour.

“I don’t want it,” Eggy said with a voice quivering with fury.

With a wave of her hand, she tossed the Death God’s Edge back to Chu Feng.

“Eggy, this is a weapon that you can...”

Chu Feng was still intending to explain, but before he could finish his words, Eggy had already interjected in.

“I know. This is a good weapon, but I don’t like how you obtained it. Chu Feng, listen to my words clearly. I know that you care for me, but I won’t allow you to put your life on the line to obtain items for me. I’ll never accept something that you have obtained through such a manner,” Eggy berated Chu Feng.

It was rare for her to lash out at Chu Feng, let alone use such firm words.

But even though she was scolding him, Chu Feng still felt warm inside. He knew that Eggy was only saying these words out of concern for him. In the end, Eggy just didn’t want him to take the risk.

“Hey hey hey, are the two of you done flirting with one another? Damned harlot, the only reason why you’re still breathing now is because I can’t bear to kill you, but you still dare to mess around with that trash in my face? Aren’t you looking down on me too much!

“I’ll give you one last chance. Do you want to submit to me or die?”

The Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit pointed the Bloodbone Sword toward Eggy as he questioned.

Perhaps it was due to him successfully driving Eggy back earlier, he was overflowing with confidence.

“Hah...”

Yet, his words were only responded with a disdainful sneer from Eggy.

“You’re already using your full strength, aren’t you?” Eggy asked.

“Haven’t you felt my amazing prowess for yourself?” the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit replied gleefully.

“How meaningless,” Eggy shook her head in disappointment.

“Meaningless? What in the world are you talking about?” the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit replied with a frown.

“What I want to say is that even when you’re using your full strength, you still aren’t worthy of me going all out on you. You’re simply... too weak,” Eggy said.

“Shit! I let you go, and yet you turned around to insult me. Damned harlot, I shall reduce this beautiful body of yours into minced meat then!”

Right after saying those words, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit raised the Bloodbone Sword in his grasp to brandish it at Milady Queen once more, but even after some time had passed, the anticipated attack didn’t come.

This sight baffled not just the onlookers but even the world spirit himself.

It was not that he didn’t want to bring his sword down, but that he was unable to do so. His arm seemed to have been fixed in place by some force, leaving him unable to move it at all.

When everyone took a closer look, they were all stunned.

Eggy, who was still with Chu Feng a moment ago, had suddenly materialized behind the world spirit, and her slender and delicate hand was holding up the world spirit’s massive arm.

It was due to this that the world spirit was unable to launch his attack.

“You...”

The Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit turned to look at Eggy as a hint of fear crept into the depths of his eyes. This was the first time his eyes had shown such terror.

“Like I said, you’re too weak,” Eggy said as her smile grew more and more enigmatic.

Following that, she released a huge burst of black aura from her body. The black aura swiftly manifested into two massive black hands that spanned over a thousand meters in terms of length. These hands grabbed the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit by the side, trapping him in the middle.

Then, with a loud ‘puchi’, fresh blood spurted forth like an erupting volcano from between the two massive hands.

At the same time, the aura of the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit also vanished altogether.

Even Yu Sha was horrified by this sight. She knew that Eggy was powerful, but she hadn’t thought that the latter would have reached such a level.

However, the one who was the most frightened of all at this very moment was no other than Gongsun Yuntian. Without any hesitation, he immediately turned tail and headed for the spirit formation gate.

He no longer had any interest in continuing the trial anymore. The only thought dominating his mind at this very moment was to escape from this goddamned place.

Shoosh!

But before he could come close to the spirit formation gate, a figure suddenly flitted right in front of him, blocking off his way toward the spirit formation gate.

It was a beautiful figure who was the dream lover of countless men, but in Gongsun Yuntian’s eyes, she looked no different from the grim reaper who was out for his life.

Putong!

Gongsun Yuntian knelt down on the door.

“Please, spare me. Don’t kill me! I’m begging you, let me off!”

Gongsun Yuntian pleaded desperately to Milady Queen as tears of desperation glistened in his eyes.

“You seem to be kneeling to the wrong person,” Eggy remarked as she shot a glance at Chu Feng.

Gongsun Yuntian immediately caught her drift and turned around to kneel at Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, I know my mistake. I really do! Please, spare me! I actually wasn’t planning to kill you at all. It was all that darned world spirit’s own doing. It was too powerful that I couldn’t control it; summoning him takes a huge toll on me, and I still have to worship him like my ancestor. I’m thankful to you for killing him for me. As long as you let me live, I’ll do anything to repay your favor!” Gongsun Yuntian pleaded.

“Gongsun Yuntian, where has your dignity gone? Weren’t you decisive when you chose to cast aside your brothers’ life for your own dignity? Weren’t you so tough that you wouldn’t even speak a single word of apology? Why are you kneeling before me then? Don’t you think that you’re letting your brothers down?” Chu Feng asked with a cold sneer.

“I’m shameless. I’m despicable. I’ll admit to it all! Please, just let me off. I, Gongsun Yuntian, has never kneeled to anyone in my entire life, even my parents. You’re the only one I have ever kneeled to. So please, spare me!”

Gongsun Yuntian was so anxious that he actually started crying.

“Very well, I’ll let you off then,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah? A-are you serious?”

Gongsun Yuntian’s eyes widened in disbelief upon hearing those words.

“I, Chu Feng, never speak words that I don’t mean. However, i can’t just leave you like that.” Chu Feng turned to Eggy and said, “Help me restrain him.”

“Chu Feng, are you joking with me? Are you really intending on letting him off?”

Eggy thought that Chu Feng was just playing around, so she was taken aback when she heard that the latter had really gotten serious.

“Yeah, I’m serious about this,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“I really don’t get you.”

Eggy didn’t agree with Chu Feng’s decision, but she didn’t probe too deeply into the rationale in his actions. She released her black aura and wrapped it tightly around Gongsun Yuntian, ensuring that the latter wouldn’t be able to pull anything.

Chu Feng took out a formation sack and tossed the restrained Gongsun Yuntian into it. Then, the formation sack turned small, allowing him to tuck it away in his robe.

“Milady Queen, your fighting prowess is far greater than before. Is that the effect of the Asura God-Demon Rock?” Chu Feng asked with a chuckle.

“Don’t bother bootlicking me.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Eggy shot a look at Chu Feng before slowly walking toward him. She raised her hand and snatched the Death God’s Edge over from his grasp.

“I’ll make an exception and accept the gift this time around. However, know that if you do it again, I’ll definitely not accept anything you give. On top of that, I’ll also give you a good pummeling too!”

Despite her words, Eggy had a smile on her face as she brandished the massive Death God’s Edge in her grasp. It was obvious that she was fond of the weapon.

“Of course!”

Chu Feng was also delighted to see that Eggy was fond of the weapon. Even though Eggy didn’t want him to injure himself for her, he felt that it was well worth the price to bring such a ravishing smile onto Eggy’s face.

Following that, he began to set up a formation to conceal the returning spirit formation gate.

“Who allowed you in here?”

But before he could fully conceal the spirit formation gate, a cold and vicious vice echoed loudly in the hall.

Turning his head over, both Eggy and Chu Feng immediately knew that things weren’t going well.
