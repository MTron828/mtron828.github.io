Chapter 2057 - Heart Sunk

“What do you mean by that?” Chu Feng asked with a frown. Subconsciously, he felt that Xue Ji was not joking with him.

As for Xue Ji, she did not answer Chu Feng’s question. Instead, she smiled lightly. It was a very charming smile. However, it was also an extremely unfathomable smile.

“Xue Ji, where are you?! Quickly, get over here!!!”

Right at that moment, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master let out a ear-deafening snarl. He was calling out for Xue Ji.

At that moment, Chu Feng was even more shocked. The reason for that was because Xue Ji was clearly before Chu Feng. Since the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was able to lock onto Chu Feng’s location, how could he not know where Xue Ji was?

Furthermore, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master almost possessed the might of a Half Martial Ancestor now. As such, why would he not be able to determine Xue Ji’s location?

After being surprised, Chu Feng looked to Xue Ji, and discovered that Xue Ji was looking at him with a smile on her face. Merely, her charming smile felt extremely dangerous to Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, seeing that we have been acquaintances with one another for years, I’ll tell you a secret.”

“That so-called Dark Hall’s Hall Master has trained in a kind of demonic technique. As long as that demonic technique devours living things, its strength will increase. Furthermore, the cultivation of the living things it devours does not matter. It would suffice as long as they’re alive. However, the speed at which his cultivation increases will be determined by the quantity of living things he devours.”

“To put it simply, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master plans to devour all living things in the Holy Land of Martialism. The more he devours, the faster his cultivation will increase. That will become the way through which he increases his cultivation in the future.”

“If you wish to stop him, there are two methods to do so. The first method is to prevent living things from appearing before him.”

“As for the second method, it would be to kill him quickly. The reason for that is because the longer he is kept alive, the stronger he will become. Right now, he is still not yet an actual Half Martial Ancestor. However, if he becomes able to completely control that demonic technique, as well as the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts within his body, then, with his world spirit techniques, it would be very easy for him to find out where all the living things in the Holy Land of Martialism are. At that time, there would likely not be anyone that could stop him,” Xue Ji said to Chu Feng.

“Why are you telling me this?” Chu Feng asked.

Xue Ji smiled at Chu Feng’s question. Then, her body shifted, and she disappeared.

At that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze toward the battle between the Dark Hall’s Hall Master and the Moon Immortal.

That battlefield had become an area where even the Elf King, the number one expert in the Holy Land of Martialism, did not dare approach.

However, at that moment, a lump of majestic black gaseous flames actually managed to withstand the Half Martial Ancestor’s might and forcibly arrive beside the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.

“What is that?”

Upon seeing the black gaseous flames, the crowd present were all startled. The reason for that was because they were all able to sense that those black gaseous flames contained a lifeform. Merely, they were unable to tell what sort of lifeform it was for it to be able to withstand such powerful energy ripples and approach the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.

When the black gaseous flames dissipated into the air, the already shocked crowd were immediately struck dumb. Even the Elf King started to frown. His expression turned even more uneasy.

The reason for that was because those black gaseous flames contained none other than Xue Ji, who had just been beside Chu Feng.

At that moment, it was no longer only Chu Feng; practically everyone present realized that that woman by the name of Xue Ji was even stronger, even more frightening than they had anticipated.

“Moon Immortal, remember this. The next time we meet, I’ll have you in my stomach.”

Right at that moment, a strange light emitted from the body of the Dark Hall’s Hall Master. It started to spread, and soon covered his entire enormous body.

Strangely, even though the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was emitting an overwhelming demonic aura, that light was emitting a vast amount of righteous aura. They were simply incompatible. However, at that moment, that vast amount of righteous aura was protecting the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.

Regardless of what sort of attack the Moon Immortal threw at him, she was unable to break through that vast light covering the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.

Suddenly, the light intensified. It was so dazzling that one could not even open one’s eyes. It was as if the sun had descended onto the surface as a burning sensation arrived alongside the dazzling light.

However, that sensation lasted only an instant.

When the crowd managed to open their eyes again, they discovered that the vast amount of righteous light had disappeared, along with the Dark Hall’s Hall Master and Xue Ji.

Not even a trace of their aura remained. It was as if they were never there to begin with. No one knew where they had gone to.

“He actually possessed such a protective treasure?” At that moment, shocked expressions appeared on Su Rou and Su Mei’s faces. To be exact, it was the Moon Immortal who revealed that shocked expression.

At that moment, the Elf King and the others were also frowning. Evidently, none of them had expected the Dark Hall’s Hall Master to have such a trick up his sleeve.

Today, they had experienced the techniques of the Dark Hall’s Hall Master. Even though the current Dark Hall was in a complete mess, they all knew that if the Dark Hall’s Hall Master were to make a comeback, he himself would be able to bring about true terror, true catastrophe, upon the Holy Land of Martialism.

However, compared to the Alliance Army, it was the people from the Dark Hall that were in greater despair. They did not expect that their Hall Master would escape by himself at such a time.

No, he hadn’t escaped by himself. Their Lord Hall Master had taken one person with him. That person was Xue Ji. However... that already didn’t concern them anymore. The reason for that was because they were all left behind.

Suddenly, the Elf King ordered, “Kill all the people from the Dark Hall. Leave none alive.”

Once his order was given, the Alliance Army all started to attack. They began to ruthlessly massacre the remainder of the Dark Hall.

Due to the fact that the disparity between the strength of the two groups was so enormous, there was no need for the Elf King to do anything. At that moment, he turned his gaze to Su Rou and Su Mei. He clasped his fist and said, “Thank you, Moon Immortal, for your assistance.”

However, the Moon Immortal completely ignored the Elf King’s courteous action. The bodies of Su Rou and Su Mei shifted and disappeared.

When Su Rou and Su Mei reappeared, they were before Chu Feng.

Upon seeing the familiar Su Rou and Su Mei, Chu Feng felt pained in his heart. However, he was no longer as emotional as he was back then. After all, the Moon Immortal had saved them.

“My apologies,” The Moon Immortal said to Chu Feng in a very apologetic manner.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed. He revealed a very complicated expression.

“I don’t know why you did this. However, I know that you possessed your own justification. I only have one request. Please spare them,” Chu Feng said to the Moon Immortal. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Rest assured, I know that they are very important to you. I also do not wish to continue seeing you lovers being separated like this.”

“I promise you that I will guarantee their safety. In the future, I will personally repay them for lending me their bodies,” The Moon Immortal said.

Chu Feng reluctantly nodded his head. He was able to tell that the Moon Immortal didn’t seem to be lying. Although she had seized Su Rou and Su Mei’s bodies, she really didn’t appear to be evil. Likely, she possessed some sort of hidden trouble.

However, it remained that Chu Feng’s nod was done very reluctantly. Actually, had it been his body that was seized, he would have nodded his head without the slightest hesitation. However, the Moon Immortal had seized the bodies of Su Rou and Su Mei. Chu Feng was unable to make decisions on their behalf, nor was he willing to see their bodies being controlled by someone else.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng said, “If possible, may I request one thing?”

“You want me to eliminate that monster?” The Moon Immortal asked.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded his head again. Actually, he found it embarrassing to ask that. After all, he had viewed the Moon Immortal as an enemy before. However, there was now no other choice.

“Even without you requesting that of me, I would’ve done so. Else, I would not have come here today. However, there is one thing that I must remind you of.”

“I was able to beat that monster today. However, next time around, even I do not have certainty in being able to defeat him,” The Moon Immortal said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart immediately sunk.
