Chapter 5906: Formidable Father

A gaze from the sky fell upon Chu Feng and Zi Ling.

It was the same gaze Chu Feng felt when he was in the last formation, but this time around, he could vividly feel how powerful the other party was. He felt like a trapped ant being watched by a human.

Just then, the Divine Deer spoke up, “Chu Feng, that person is extremely strong. I don’t think I’ll be able to take you out of here. Take note of that when you deal with this situation.”

Chu Feng’s heart sank.

He knew what the Divine Deer was capable of. In a way, this showed how powerful the person he was dealing with was.

“Elder, are you from the Three Saints Monstrous Clan?” Chu Feng raised his head and asked.

“That’s right,” the other party replied.

That put Chu Feng’s heart at ease a little. Perhaps there might still be room for negotiation then. It would have been much more complicated if the other party was an outsider.

“May I know what you’d like to discuss with me?” Chu Feng asked.

The other party chuckled a little before remarking, “Young friend, you have a remarkable father.”

That laugh stoked Chu Feng’s unease. It didn’t sound like a compliment but a tease, making it hard for him to tell whether the other party was a friend or a foe. It would be terrible if the other party was a foe.

Knowing there was no use to panic, Chu Feng asked, “Elder, what do you mean by that?”

“Young friend, you are a smart person. You should be able to tell from how I teleported you here that I’m the person truly in charge of the sacred mountain’s formation. I fell into hibernation here, and it’s only in recent days that I woke up. However, I found that our sacred treasure has gone missing, and this has something to do with your father,” that person said.

“Elder, how do you know it’s related to my father?”

“Don’t feign ignorance. You have a part to play in it too.”

Chu Feng’s unease intensified upon hearing those words. It was clear the other party knew what had happened.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng was still a little confused as he wasn’t sure what was the full story surrounding his father here. All he knew was that his father had likely taken out one of the black jars inside the Sacred Temple and placed it in front of him, and he released whatever was inside the black jar.

Just then, the other party asked, “Do you still have that black jar on you?”

Chu Feng was surprised to hear that. He didn’t expect the other party to know that.

“Calm down. I can see why you would withhold the truth, but as I have told you, I am the one who is truly in control of the sacred mountain’s formation. This formation records everything that has transpired in the sacred mountain within a time. As soon as I discovered that our sacred treasure had gone missing after waking up, I checked the formation’s record.

“Our sacred treasure went missing mostly due to our fault. The container we chose to contain our sacred treasure was incomplete, which is how it went missing in the first place.”

At this point, the other party paused as if to hook Chu Feng’s curiosity.

Thus, Chu Feng asked, “Elder, what happened back then? Why do you say my father has something to do with the sacred treasure’s disappearance?”

“Young friend, you guessed rightly. This formation is not just a training ground; it’s also a selection process to choose outstanding juniors and use their bloodline power to nurture the sacred treasure.

“Your father is an incredible man. If not for him, Sansheng Qiankun couldn’t have completed the nurturing process through just the first assimilation formation no matter how talented he was. Regarding that, I’d say that your father’s contribution outweighs that of our entire clan.

“However, that could also be the reason the sacred treasure prematurely awoke and broke out of its container. That being said, I’d still say that’s our clan’s problem. The container we used to contain the sacred treasure is deficient.

“The Sacred Temple hadn't opened when the sacred treasure broke out of its container. It was weak and afraid of being caught, so it hid inside one of the black jars.”

At this point, Chu Feng finally understood how his father was involved in the disappearance of the sacred treasure. It turned out that the sacred treasure was hiding inside the black jar.

In other words, the black gaseous flames that Chu Feng had released back then were likely the Darkness Monstrous God’s soul.

“It just so happened that the Sacred Temple later opened, and your father and Sansheng Qiankun entered the Sacred Temple to check the situation. The two of them were concerned about the sacred treasure’s disappearance, but your father also noticed the anomaly with the black jar.

“Later, your father snuck into our sacred mountain, entered the Sacred Temple, and took the black jar away. He planted a bloodline formation on the black jar to alter the consciousness of whatever was inside while it was in a weakened state. He lured you into our sacred mountain and placed the black jar in a spot where you could come into contact with it.

“As long as you open the jar, you’d be the first one to come into contact with it, and it would acknowledge you as its master,” the other party said.

“Acknowledge me as its master?” Chu Feng was taken aback.

“Even if it doesn’t fully acknowledge you as its master, it would still harbor special feelings for you. I checked the records—the bloodline formation your father planted on the black jar involves a powerful treasure from the Immemorial Era. Its prowess is not to be made light of.

“Your father probably only sensed the anomaly inside the black jar; I don’t think he would have known what’s contained in that jar is our missing sacred treasure. Even so, he should have still known that the black jars are equally important to our Three Saints Monstrous Clan. There’s no denying that he snuck into our Sacred Temple and took away the black jar out of greed,” the other party said.

“You said my father returned to the Sacred Temple afterward, but the Sacred Temple can only be opened after breaching a formation, right? How did my father sneak in?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re right under normal circumstances, but he pulled it off. That’s why I said you have a remarkable father,” the other party said with a laugh.

It was only now that Chu Feng understood the significance of those words. It turned out his father had found a way to circumvent some of the laws imposed on the sacred mountain.

“Elder, may I know the reason you brought me back here?” Chu Feng asked.

“I want you to retrieve our sacred treasure, and I’ll drop this matter. Until you return with our sacred treasure, you’ll be leaving your little girlfriend with me in the sacred mountain,” the other party said.

“Elder, I’ll look for the item in the black jar, but can we choose another method as leverage?” Chu Feng anxiously asked.

“Another method? Do you have a better idea than leaving your close kin behind?” the other party asked.

“I do. You can make me consume poison instead,” Chu Feng replied.

“Big brother Chu Feng, you mustn’t!” Zi Ling panicked. She would rather be detained here than to have Chu Feng consume poison.

“Hahaha!” The other party burst into laughter. “Consume poison? That’s a good idea. Very well, I shall satisfy your demand then!”

The sky turned dark. Dark clouds converged at a single spot and manifested into a black pill. The black pill floated toward Chu Feng, leaving spatial cracks in its wake. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Chu Feng would die without any shred of doubt if he couldn’t obtain the antidote.

“Elder, I’ll stay behind. Please don’t let Chu Feng consume the poison!” Zi Ling pleaded.

However, the other party ignored Zi Ling.

“Elder, please keep your promise. You have to let me and Zi Ling leave if I consume this poison pill,” Chu Feng said as he held the poison pill.

“Yes, I’ll let the two of you leave as long as you consume this pill,” the other party replied.

Chu Feng popped the poison pill into his mouth, only to stiffen a second later.

He realized that the pill, despite looking unfathomably dangerous, contained no poison at all. Rather, it was an amazing cultivation resource. Not only did it not cause any harm to Chu Feng, but it even infused natural energies harnessing martial enlightenment into his body.

“Hahahaha!” The other party burst into laughter.
