Chapter 2701 - Encountering Such Humiliation

“I do not possess any special origin,” Chu Feng replied calmly.

“What did Xia Yun’er say to you? What did you talk about with her?”

“Why did she choose you? Exactly what is the relationship between you and her?” Chu Xianshuo asked.

“There is no relationship,” Chu Feng said.

“It would appear that you do not understand your current situation.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After Chu Xianshuo said those words, he pointed at Chu Feng with his finger, and a golden ray of light flew out from his finger. It turned into a sharp blade and thrust toward Chu Feng.

“Puu~~~”

Blood splattered forth. That golden blade had pierced through Chu Feng’s chest.

“Woosh~~~”

Then, Chu Xianshuo suddenly waved his hand down. Then, the golden blade that had pierced into Chu Feng’s body began to sweep across.

Blood splattered everywhere. Chu Xianshuo had sliced off Chu Feng’s left shoulder and arm.

Chu Xianshuo’s attack was no ordinary attack. Instead, it was a special method of attack.

Although Chu Feng’s body was indestructible and undying, as he was a True Immortal, a special attack like this would still bring unimaginable pain to Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng did not utter a single groan of pain.

“It would seem that you’re a tough guy,” Chu Xianshuo did not stop.

“If you have the ability, then release me. We shall fight fairly,” Chu Feng said.

“Haha. Release you? Fight fairly? What makes you think you could fight against me?”

“Merely with your rank one True Immortal-level cultivation? This young master would be able to drown you with a single spit,” Chu Xianshuo mocked.

“It would appear that you don’t dare to release me then.”

Chu Feng smiled. Compared to Chu Xianshuo’s insults, Chu Feng’s smile was much more mocking.

“Boom~~~”

The next moment, the golden blade once again pierced into Chu Feng’s body.

However, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. Not to mention screaming in pain, he did not even blink.

“Very well, I shall see how tough you really are.”

Chu Xianshuo’s eyes were filled with killing intent. The golden blade continued to pierce through Chu Feng again and again.

Once...

Twice...

Ten times...

A hundred times...

A thousand times...

......

Just like that, in a blink of an eye, Chu Feng’s body was filled with holes.

However, Chu Feng still did not utter a single sound of pain.

Not only that, but Chu Feng was even looking at Chu Xianshuo with a sneer on his face. He said, “Is that all you’re capable of? You should at least try to make me feel pain.”

“You want to feel pain? Very well, I’ll help you.”

After saying those words, Chu Xianshuo took out a bottle. He opened the bottle and splashed its contents at Chu Feng.

“Ssslaa~~~”

The next moment, green gaseous flames appeared on Chu Feng’s body. They were burning away at Chu Feng’s flesh.

What Chu Xianshuo splattered onto Chu Feng was a special sort of poisonous fluid. It was capable of bringing about unbearable pain.

However, Chu Feng merely clenched his teeth and did not utter a single sound.

“Damn it! Kill him! Chu Feng, kill this bastard!”

Her Lady Queen was roaring furiously in Chu Feng’s world spirit space.

Even though that kind of pain was nothing major to Chu Feng, how could Her Lady Queen possibility tolerate it when she witnessed Chu Feng suffering this sort of torture with her own eyes?

“Eggy, don’t be anxious. Although we have lost the decisive opportunity and are in an absolutely disadvantaged position, he seems to be very interested in why that Holy Daughter wanted to see me.”

“As long as I do not tell him why, he will not kill me. As long as he doesn’t kill me, I will have a chance to escape.”

“As long as I can escape, I will return the humiliation I’ve received today tenfold,” Chu Feng tried to calm Her Lady Queen down.

Actually, what Chu Feng told Her Lady Queen was not merely comforting words. That was his resolve.

Regardless of who they might be, since they dared to humiliate him in such a manner, he would definitely not spare them easily.

“Puu~~~”

Right at that moment, the golden blade that was originally pierced into Chu Feng’s body was suddenly removed from Chu Feng’s body. Then, it pierced directly into Song Xi’s body.

“Ahhh~~~”

How could Song Xi possibly tolerate that sort of pain? He immediately let out a miserable scream. He was even crying in pain.

“Stop!” Chu Feng hurriedly shouted upon seeing that.

“Oh? So this is your weakness? It would appear that you care about your friend a lot,” Seeing Chu Feng’s reaction, Chu Xianshuo smiled proudly.

“If you have the ability, then aim them at me. This matter is unrelated to him,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well. I am capable of not harming him. However, you must kneel before me and then tell me what I want to know,” Chu Xianshuo said.

“Chu Feng, you must not kneel! You cannot kneel to a bastard like him!” Her Lady Queen said.

However, Song Xi was still letting out miserable screams of pain.

This caused Chu Feng to feel extremely hesitant. On the one hand, he was truly unwilling to kneel. After all... that Chu Xianshuo was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

On the other hand, he could not disregard Song Xi.

“If you still don’t kneel, I will cripple his cultivation,” Chu Xianshou threatened.

“I’ll kneel,” At that moment, Chu Feng finally made his decision.

Seeing that Chu Feng had agreed to it, Chu Xianshou revealed a smile of victory.

Merely, that smile of his was extremely disgusting to look at.

“Go on and kneel,” Chu Xianshou said to Chu Feng.

At the moment when he said those words, Chu Feng felt that, although his body was still restricted by Chu Xianshou’s oppressive might, he was able to bend his knees.

It was Chu Xianshou. He had deliberately allowed Chu Feng to bend his knees. He wanted Chu Feng to kneel on his own.

“Why are you still not kneeling?” The other Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations started to urge Chu Feng to kneel.

At that moment, Chu Feng stopped hesitating. He bent his knees and planned to kneel to Chu Xianshou.

Chu Feng had always been someone who cared deeply about his dignity and honor. However, for Song Xi’s safety, Chu Feng had decided to give up his dignity and honor.

Although he had already decided to kneel, Chu Feng was feeling enormous hatred in his heart. He hated how he was so weak that he had to yield to scum like that.

“Paaa~~~”

However, right at the moment when Chu Feng started kneeling, a powerful palm suddenly held his right arm and pulled him back up.

At the moment when that hand grabbed him, Chu Feng was able to sense that the oppressive might that was restricting his body had disappeared. He had regained his freedom.

Chu Feng raised his head to look, and discovered that it was an old man.

Chu Feng recognized that old man. That old man was one of the Starfall Eight Immortals. He was the one who had covered Chu Feng in a beam of light and brought him up to the summit.

“Young master Xianshou, this young master is our Holy Daughter’s friend. Can you give this old man face and let him go?” The old man asked.

Although he spoke in a very tranquil and even-tempered manner, seemingly even begging a bit, the expressions of Chu Xianshou and the others all changed when this old man appeared.

They were panicking.

“Of course. I actually never planned to do anything to them anyways. It was merely a joke,” Chu Xianshou immediately retrieved the golden blade that he’d pierced into Song Xi’s body.

“If only it were so,” The old man smiled lightly. Then, he said, “That said, I do hope that such a thing will not happen again in our Starfall Holy Land’s territory. Else, this old man will find it difficult to explain to our Holy Daughter.”

“This junior understands. I will not bother them again,” Chu Xianshou vowed.

“This old man will remember those words. If young master Xianshou is to go against his promise, do not blame this old man for disregarding the sentiment and face of your Chu Heavenly Clan.”

The old man was still smiling. However, an ice-cold sensation emerged in his aged eyes when he said those words.

Sensing the change in his gaze, all of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations present, including Chu Xianshou, shivered.

There were even some among them that turned pale in an instant, and began to sweat cold bullets.

Surely... they were all scared.

“Woosh~~~”

The next moment, that old man waved his sleeve and disappeared.

At the same time, Chu Feng and Song Xi also disappeared.

After that old man left, one of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation present finally dared to say, “Damn it! A mere elder from the Starfall Holy Land dared to threaten us?! He is simply tired of living!”
