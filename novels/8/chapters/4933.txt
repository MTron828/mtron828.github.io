Chapter 4933: Mysterious Red Cloaks

“Chu Feng, let’s quickly leave this area.”

Princess Xiaoxiao grabbed Chu Feng’s robe as she spoke. Her face was drained of blood, and her eyes reflected her deep terror. It was unusual for someone who was usually as composed as her to be so terrified, but Chu Feng could understand where she was coming from.

The scenery outside was simply too terrifying.

Be it the overwhelming blood stench, the mountains of carcasses, or the crimson earth, only those who witnessed this scene in person would understand its terror. Those gigantic beasts had to be incredibly powerful existences, but they were massacred just like that.&nbsp;

On top of that, Chu Feng could sense that their origin energies had been completely devoured clean. Whatever treasures they had on them had also been scraped clean.&nbsp;

Some of them were wearing armor whereas the others had their bodies bare, which hinted that their race had the culture of wearing clothes, just that they were stripped naked

“Stop looking, Chu Feng. Let’s go!” Princess Xiaoxiao spoke with a quivering voice.

“Let’s go.”

Chu Feng was also feeling unnerved.

It was clear that these ancient beings hadn’t died for a long time, which meant that there was a possibility that the murderer was still in the vicinity. But who could it be?

The first person whom Chu Feng thought about was the person who broke the barrier outside.&nbsp; Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He initially thought that the person who broke the barrier was the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, but it was looking more likely that it could be someone else now.&nbsp;

If the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster had chosen to tag along with him, she would have chosen to protect him from the shadows. She wouldn’t massacre these ancient beings for no reason.&nbsp;

It was dangerous for them to remain here with such a powerful individual lurking in the vicinity.&nbsp;

“Let’s go.”

Chu Feng quickly closed the door and left through the spirit formation gate together with Princess Xiaoxiao.

What he didn’t know was that there were two pairs of eyes looking at him while he was assessing the bloodshed earlier. They were standing above the carcass of one of the ancient beings, just that they had hidden their presence.&nbsp;

It was only after Chu Feng left that the space above the carcass began distorting, revealing a tall and a short silhouette.&nbsp;

Despite their difference in stature, they were dressed in similar clothing—a red veil and a red cloak. There were no other accessories on them, which looked as if they were covered in blood. It surprisingly didn’t look scary, though it felt oppressive.&nbsp;

The veil appeared to have a formation cast on it. It blurred their appearance to the extent that it was impossible to make out their faces.&nbsp;

“That man named Chu Feng appears to have quite some means. I didn’t expect him to be able to acquire that stone. It looks like there are still prodigies in the Nine Souls Galaxy. However, what I find more interesting is how he shares the character ‘Feng’ in his name as well. I wonder if this is what people call fate,” the taller of the two figures spoke with a young, masculine voice.&nbsp;

His gentle tone hinted that he was a mild-tempered person.

“You have only arrived at the Nine Souls Galaxy, young master Feng, so you might be unaware. However, Chu Feng isn’t from the Nine Souls Galaxy but the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. He has forged a name for himself in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

“Even though his talent is still lacking compared to young master Feng, he still can be considered as a top-notch prodigy in the eastern region of this vast world of cultivation,” the shorter of the two figures replied.

His voice sounded old, making it likely that he was an elder.&nbsp;

“I thought that no one would be able to obtain the secret skill here, so I intervened and took it away. Who could have thought that there would be someone else who wields such capabilities here? If not for me, he would have been the one to claim the secret skill.

“Elder Xuan, should we return the secret skill to him? Wouldn’t our actions be considered a violation of the rules otherwise?” the young man asked.&nbsp;

“Young master Feng, there’s no need for that. We shouldn’t cross paths with them. Since we have already taken the secret skill, it’s unnecessary for us to return it,” the elder replied.

“Alright. I’ll listen to you, Elder Xuan. Let’s go,” the young man said.

His silhouette vanished the next moment, and the elder quickly followed suit.

…&nbsp;

Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Princess Xiaoxiao had already returned to where Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian was at. The two of them informed the others about the plight that had befallen the ancient beings living in the ancient remnant.

Thus, under Shengguang Baimei’s lead, the group quickly left the ancient remnant.

It would be unwise for them to linger in a place that clearly reeked of danger.

Perhaps out of nervousness, none of them uttered a word at all. They were all top-notch figures from the Nine Souls Galaxy and the Holy Light Galaxy, but they couldn’t help but feel tense at the situation.

It was only when they were a distance away from the ancient remnant that Chu Feng finally spoke up.

“Master Yin Ren, you have a deep understanding of the ancient remnant. Are you aware if the ancient beings have any enemies?” Chu Feng asked.

He wanted to know who were the culprits who massacred the ancient beings.

“Young friend Chu Feng, most of what I know comes from records that were left behind. I hardly know anything about the ancient beings living in the ancient remnant, let alone their enemies,” Master Yin Ren shook his head and replied.

“Young hero Chu Feng, did you spot anyone dressed in red cloak there?” Shengguang Baimei suddenly asked.

“Red cloak? I’m afraid not. Why did you ask such a question? Elder Baimei, do you know something about this?” Chu Feng asked.

“This is not the first time a race of ancient beings has been massacred. Such occurrences have become frequent in both our Holy Light Galaxy and the Nine Souls Galaxy. One of the elders of our Holy Valley has witnessed with his own eyes a red-cloaked figure massacring the ancient beings.

“Our Holy Valley dispatched some personnel to search for the red-cloaked figure, but we were always a step late. To this day, we are still unable to ascertain what their goals are,” Shengguang Baimei said.

“Red-cloaked figures? Could they be from the Netherworld Sect?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng knew that those from the Netherworld Sect were fond of dressing in red too, and the Netherworld Sect were known for their unfathomable prowess too. It was likely that they possessed the power to massacre the ancient beings.

“They aren’t. Those from the Netherworld Sect do dress in red robes, but their clothes are embroidered with the words ‘Netherworld Envoy’. On top of that, they wear a white veil on top of that.&nbsp;

“However, the ones who are massacring the ancient beings are dressed in red veils, and there are no embroidered words on their cloaks,” Shengguang Baimei replied.

“Elder Baimei, you mentioned that an elder from the Holy Valley had encountered them. Have you crossed hands with them then?” Chu Feng asked.

“That elder was searching for an ancient remnant and didn’t know that there were ancient beings living there. He accidentally barged into their territory.&nbsp;

“Those ancient beings were extremely violent and powerful, and the encounter placed the elder in an extremely precarious position. It was then that a red-cloaked figure made an appearance. In a matter of moments, they slaughtered all of the ancient beings.&nbsp;

“Initially, we thought that the red-cloaked figure only seemed powerful due to the limited strength of that elder, but further investigation has shown that the red-cloaked figures aren’t to be made light of.&nbsp;

“Let me put it in this way. If the one who has massacred the ancient beings today is indeed one of the red-cloaked figures, we would certainly be goners if they tries to make a move on us. Even I wouldn’t be able to stop them,” Shengguang Baimei said.&nbsp;

“So, the red-cloaked figures aren’t from the Netherworld Sect but some sort of power that specializes in dealing with ancient beings, right? Based on what you have said, it doesn’t seem like they have harmed any ordinary cultivators yet,” Chu Feng said.

“That red-cloaked figure did notice our elder that day, but they didn’t harm him. They simply chose to ignore him,” Shengguang Baimei replied.&nbsp;

“Are they hunting the ancient beings to steal their treasures, or is there a deeper reason to that?”

Chu Feng fell into deep thoughts.
