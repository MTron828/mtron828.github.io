Chapter 3262 - Frightened Gazes

After laughing for some time, Linghu Tiemian looked at Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, you are not the most daring person I’ve ever met. However, you are most definitely the person with the most exaggerated opinion of his abilities that I’ve ever met.”

“It would appear that you’re insistent on having me act?” Chu Feng said.

Once Chu Feng said those words, the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen and the Li Heavenly Clansmen were all astonished.

As for those people that did not know about Chu Feng’s character, some among them were unable to contain themselves, and started laughing.

Those were laughters of ridicule. They were ridiculing Chu Feng because they felt that what he had said was truly arrogant.

‘Does he really think that he’ll be able to defeat the others from the Linghu Heavenly Clan just because he defeated those in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light?’

‘Evidently, this Chu Feng has no idea how powerful Linghu Tiemian is.’

‘He is truly courting death.’

“Hahaha. Very well, go ahead and do it then. Let me witness how you shall challenge our Linghu Heavenly Clan,” Linghu Tiemian let out a ridiculing laugh.

“Very well, I will satisfy you,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he pointed gently at Linghu Tiemian.

A ‘putt’ was heard. In the next moment, the crowd’s expressions all changed. Their faces all turned pale.

The reason for that was because that ‘putt’ sound came from the location where Linghu Tiemian was standing.

Linghu Tiemian, who was standing previously, was suddenly lying on his stomach at that moment.

“Big brother Tiemian, what’s wrong?”

At that moment, the other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen beside Linghu Tiemian hurriedly rushed toward him to help him back up.

However, no matter how much strength they exerted, they were unable to bring Linghu Tiemian back up.

“What’s happening? What happened to me?”

It was not only the bystanders that were confused; Linghu Tiemian himself was also confused.

Apart from knowing that he was incapable of controlling his body, Linghu Tiemian had no idea what had happened to him.

At that moment, Chu Feng gently pointed in Linghu Tiemian’s direction again.

In the next moment, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen beside Linghu Tiemian also fell onto their stomachs like he had.

A Linghu Heavenly Clansman pointed at Chu Feng and loudly shouted, “Chu Feng, it’s you who did this?!”

Hearing that shout, everyone turned their eyes to Chu Feng.

“I am truly not fond of people that ask questions that they already know the answer to.”

“Furthermore, I am even more unfond of people that shout at me.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he narrowed his brows. In the next moment, a scream was heard.

That Linghu Heavenly Clansman that had pointed and shouted at Chu Feng was shot flying out and smashed ruthlessly into the plaza’s honored guest seats.

Rocks were shattered as he landed. As for him, his flesh was completely lacerated.

“Heavens! This...”

witnessing that scene, including the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, even the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen and the Li Heavenly Clansmen were stunned. Disbelief filled their eyes.

Chu Feng had yet to reveal his aura. However, he seemed to possess the power to control everything. It was not something that could be explained with one’s cultivation, as it seemed like everything in that place was under Chu Feng’s control.

“You... exactly what have you done?” Someone from the Linghu Heavenly Clan asked. Merely, compared to the person before, that person was no longer shouting. Instead, his voice was trembling with fear.

“You don’t understand? Very well, I’ll let you understand.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve. With that, the spirit formation gate leading to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s main city that was opened by the Linghu Heavenly Clan instantly disappeared.

“Heavens...”

At that moment, the crowd were all tongue-tied.

The reason for that was because the power Chu Feng had unleashed was most definitely not a power that martial cultivators possessed. No matter how powerful a martial cultivator might be, they couldn’t possibly erase a spirit formation gate so effortlessly.

One must know that that spirit formation gate was created with the power of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s formation core.

Right at that moment, Li Anzhi asked with surprise, “Chu Feng, you’ve grasped the power of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s main formation?!”

Hearing Li Anzhi’s question, the crowd all realized that Chu Feng’s body was emitting a faint light. That light was spirit power. That should be the source of Chu Feng’s overwhelming power.

“I don’t know if that’s the main formation. However, it is true that I have obtained the power of a spirit formation. As for that spirit formation, it seems to be quite powerful. Right now, I am able to control everything in the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm as my heart desires, including these people.”

After he said those words, Chu Feng looked to the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. He said, “If I wish it, I can have them die here. Not even the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s grand protective formation will be able to protect them.”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd all turned their eyes to the Linghu Heavenly Clansman that was seriously injured by Chu Feng.

As they looked over, frightened expressions filled the crowd’s faces.

The reason for that was because that Linghu Heavenly Clansman’s injuries were still present on his body. They had not healed at all.

The Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s grand protective formation was actually ineffective for him.

This meant that Chu Feng had truly gained control of an extremely powerful spirit formation, so powerful that he could ignore the grand defensive formation and control everyone’s life and death.

With the situation being like that, how could the crowd not feel astonished?

After all, it was not only the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan that were present in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm; they too were present in this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

As long as they were there, their lives and deaths would be under Chu Feng’s control.

“Linghu Heavenly Clan, I will give you all a chance. Scram from the Overlord Region right now, and I will let you all live,” Chu Feng said to the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. His attitude was still incomparably arrogant.

However, at that moment, not a single person dared to hold him in contempt. Not a single person dared to ridicule him.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng truly controlled everything at that moment, including their lives.

In the past, the Linghu Heavenly Clan was the ruler of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

However, Chu Feng was now the god of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
