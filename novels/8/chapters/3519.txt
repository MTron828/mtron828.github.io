Chapter 3519 - Rank One Exalted

“What a powerful abnormal sign. Which elder within our clan is undergoing closed-door training?” someone asked.

“An abnormal sign of this caliber is indeed very rare,” even Berserker Li and the other Supreme Elders were making guesses as to who had reached a breakthrough.

“We will know the answer once that tribulation lightning strikes,” the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

The Li heavenly Clansmen all felt what their Lord Clan Chief said to be very reasonable. Thus, they all began to stare at the surging lightning high up in the sky, awaiting their descent so as to determine the location of the cultivator undergoing their breakthrough.

“Rumble~~~”

Finally, the lightning struck down from the highest heaven.

However, when the lightning struck, the expressions of the Li Heavenly Clansmen all became complicated.

The reason for that was because that powerful tribulation lightning had descended into the Li Heavenly Clan’s Ancestral Formation.

They all knew very well that even if their Li Heavenly Clansmen managed to reach a breakthrough in their Li Heavenly Clan’s Ancestral Formation, they would not give rise to an abnormal sign.

The only exception would be... if the person who made the breakthrough was not someone from their Li Heavenly Clan.

Should that be the case, the answer became clear. The person who had made the breakthrough was naturally none other than Chu Feng.

“No wonder this abnormal sign is so astonishing. It turns out that it’s actually the abnormal sign from the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique,” the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled in a very meaningful manner.

Originally, he was looking forward to finding out who it might be from his clan that gave rise to such a powerful abnormal sign.

However, the answer he came to had disappointed him somewhat.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, a vast amount of lightning once again appeared high up in the sky.

“The lightning didn’t disperse?”

“No, the lightning has gathered again. Could it be that Chu Feng is making successive breakthroughs?”

This time around, the Li Heavenly Clansmen knew immediately without even bothering to think that the tribulation lightning was caused by Chu Feng. After all, lightning of such a caliber was impossible to summon even for their Lord Clan Chief.

“Perhaps this is what they mean by demon-level genius. Even their breakthroughs in cultivation are this extraordinary,” the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Not long afterward, the tribulation lightning struck down again.

However, right after the lightning struck, more lightning once again gathered high up in the sky. Furthermore, the lightning this time around was much more imposing than the previous two times.

“Could it be another breakthrough?” At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clansmen had very marvelous expressions on their faces.

“Cough cough, that is indeed befitting the title of a demon-level genius,” the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief forced a smile. Then, he sighed. “Exactly what sort of good deed did the Chu Heavenly Clan do for them to be looked after by the heavens like this?”

When he said those words, there was deep envy on the face and in the eyes of the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

With the three successive lightning strikes, Chu Feng’s cultivation had made three successive breakthroughs.

He had increased his cultivation from rank seven Martial Immortal to rank one Exalted.

It was most definitely not a coincidence that he was able to make successive breakthroughs to rank one Exalted.

Chu Feng had recently encountered a lot of opportunities in the recent days. Because of that, he had gained a whole new level of comprehension toward martial cultivation.

However, due to the backlash from the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak causing his cultivation to decrease, he was unable to attempt breakthroughs in his cultivation.

Of course, the power of the Lightning Curse was most definitely linked to why he was able to make successive breakthroughs to the Exalted realm all at once.

Although Chu Feng had some certainty of success in being able to make a breakthrough to the Exalted realm by relying on the martial comprehension he had obtained previously, it was only a small amount of certainty.

After the power of the Lightning Curse assimilated with him, he gained a ninety percent certainty of success.

And sure enough, he succeeded.

“Exalted-level martial power is truly quite decent.”

At that moment, Chu Feng sensed the Exalted-level martial power within him and the surroundings. Sensing the new martial power that he could now command, Chu Feng became very excited.

Even though Saint-cloak World Spiritists also possessed battle power on par with rank one Exalted, it was only on par. It meant something completely different for Chu Feng’s own cultivation to reach rank one Exalted.

While his cultivation had become that of a rank one Exalted, he was also able to use his Divine Lightning Mark, as well as his Lightning Armor. Thus, his actual battle power was on par with a rank three Exalted. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was a completely different concept.

“You actually only managed to become an Exalted? It would appear that the power of the Lightning Curse is nothing much,” Lord Frog’s voice was suddenly heard.

At that moment, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from looking in the direction where Lord Frog was.

He was surprised by Lord Frog’s words. After all, even he felt that it was amazing that he could make three successive breakthroughs.

However, Lord Frog instead evaluated it as ‘nothing much.’

This perked Chu Feng’s curiosity as to how powerful the original power of the Lightning Mark was. Could it be that he had overlooked something?

Thus, Chu Feng asked, “Senior, could it be that the power of the Lightning Curse is even stronger than this?”

“I actually don’t know how strong it is either. After all, no one else has been able to obtain its acknowledgement,” said Lord Frog.

“So that’s the case,” after finding out that Lord Frog did not have a definite answer, Chu Feng felt relieved. He felt that it would be good as long as he did not waste the power of the Lightning Curse.

Then, Chu Feng began to chat with Lord Frog.

He wanted to learn more about the Li Heavenly Clan’s Ancestral Formation through Lord Frog. Of course... he also wanted to know exactly who that Lord Frog was.

Unfortunately, Lord Frog was very much on guard. Thus, he did not reveal anything to Chu Feng.

In the end, he used the excuse of needing rest to no longer bother paying attention to him.

With that being the case, Chu Feng found the situation quite boring. After all, apart from him and Lord Frog, there didn’t seem to be anyone else in the formation core.

As for Li Yue’er, Chu Feng felt even more helpless regarding her.

Chu Feng had made three successive breakthroughs already to directly reach the Exalted realm. However, that girl was still in the process of making her breakthrough.

Chu Feng didn’t know exactly how long it would take for her to finish her breakthrough. After all, her breakthrough differed from his.

In fact, for the majority of martial cultivators, they would need a lot of time to undergo closed-door training and attempt to make a breakthrough. In fact, being in closed-door training for decades or even centuries was a common thing.

Because of that, Chu Feng began to wonder if he should continue to wait for her.

“Forget it, I’m not waiting anymore.”

Finally, he made his decision. Since he had confirmed that Li Yue’er was safe and sound, and the upheaval caused by the Li Heavenly Clan’s Ancestral Formation was caused by her, and wasn’t something serious, Chu Feng decided that there was no reason for him to continue to stay here.

Although he wanted to reminisce on the past with Li Yue’er, Chu Feng felt that he should return to the Chu Heavenly Clan first.

After all, he had just been ranked first amongst the Ancestral Martial Decastars. It was still unknown how the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield viewed the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After making his decision, Chu Feng took out the two Exalted-level Sacred Temple Beads that he had prepared for Li Yue’er and placed them on the ground.

“Chu Feng?”

To Chu Feng’s surprise, right when he was leaving, Li Yue’er’s voice sounded.

Chu Feng turned around. Sure enough, Li Yue’er had awakened. Furthermore, she had already gotten up, and was staring at him with her pair of beautiful eyes.

“Girl, it’s been a long time,” Chu Feng smiled and waved at her.

At that moment, Chu Feng felt extremely joyous. Perhaps this was fate. Just when he had decided to leave, that girl Li Yue’er had actually regained consciousness.

However, to Chu Feng’s surprise, although he was greeting Li Yue’er with a joyful smile, she completely ignored him. She sat back down cross-legged and closed her eyes.

Chu Feng was puzzled by this sight.

Suddenly, she opened her eyes again and arrived directly before him from the formation core.

“Even if it’s an illusion, it’s pretty decent that I’m able to see you again.”
