Chapter 3488 - The Power Of Asura

Chu Feng’s words brought enormous displeasure to Linghu Hongfei.

He had no prior knowledge of Chu Feng at all. However, Chu Xuanyuan was someone that he knew a lot about.

The former legend of the Ancestral Martial Starfield had always been the target that he wanted to surpass. Because of that, he had spent a lot of effort to scout out his past achievements.

Furthermore, he had set a goal for himself that he must accomplish feats more extraordinary than Chu Xuanyuan did at the same age.

Unfortunately, the outcome brought Linghu Hongfei an unprecedented sense of defeat.

Ages identical to Chu Xuanyuan continued to pass him by. However, he was never able to surpass him, not even once.

Chu Xuanyuan was like an insurmountable mountain crushing down on Linghu Hongfei’s chest, suffocating him.

Although he was indeed a rare genius that everyone had to acknowledge, he was much too inferior when compared to Chu Xuanyuan.

Although rumors were going around the Ancestral Martial Starfield that he, Linghu Hongfei, had already surpassed Chu Xuanyuan, the people who had really witnessed Chu Xuanyuan’s capability back in the day all believed that he was inferior to him.

Even he himself knew this very well.

This was a sore in his heart, something that he could never erase. He had always wanted to forget about this sore spot. He had even began to hypnotize himself so that he could forget about Chu Xuanyuan’s shadow.

However, this painful sore was once again been aggravated by Chu Feng.

“It would appear that brother Chu Feng is not going to concede. In that case, I can only strong-arm you into admitting defeat.”

After he finished saying those words, Linghu Hongfei’s oppressive might started moving towards Chu Feng again.

The speed with which his oppressive might moved toward Chu Feng was very slow. However, when the oppressive might enveloped his body and began to press down on it, Chu Feng felt enormous pain.

The reason for that was because that was not ordinary oppressive might. Contained within it was a special martial power capable of bringing about enormous pain.

“Why must Chu Feng insist on suffering? The outcome of the battle is already determined, why is he still insisting on continuing?”

“It’s merely admitting defeat. Perhaps admitting defeat to someone else might be humiliating. However, it would not at all be humiliating to admit defeat to Linghu Hongfei.”

“Instead, to insist on continuing after the outcome has been determined is humiliating. It will make others look down on him. I truly cannot understand why he would insist on doing so.”

The crowd began to discuss the matter spiritedly. Many people even began to blame Chu Feng. They felt that his insistence was completely meaningless.

“No matter what, Chu Feng has already proved himself today. If it wasn’t for Linghu Hongfei being present, he would definitely have obtained the first ranked spot in this selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars today.”

“Even if he is facing Linghu Hongfei, he did not suffer a humiliating defeat. After all, he’s quite a bit younger than Linghu Hongfei.”

“To possess such strength at such a young age, he is also a true demon-level genius. As expected of Chu Hanxian’s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

“In my opinion, that prophesied child is definitely not Wuma Shengjie. Instead, it should be Chu Feng.”

“Indeed. Judging from today, Chu Feng does indeed possess the potential to become Linghu Hongfei’s future rival.”

Of course, there was also a portion of people that felt that even if Chu Feng were to be defeated by Linghu Hongfei, he did not lose in humiliation. They felt that one could not find any fault with Chu Feng’s performance.

Even if he was inferior to Linghu Hongfei, he was still unrivaled before all the other younger generations.

It could be said that he was below only a single person, and stood above hundreds of millions of others.

However, when those voices reached Linghu Hongfei’s ears, it caused a greater feeling of suffocation toward his already unstable heart.

“Chu Feng, are you still not going to concede? If that’s the case, I will have you humiliate yourself even more thoroughly.”

Although Linghu Hongfei appeared to be a righteous individual, he was actually insulting Chu Feng nonstop through voice transmission.

“If you have the capability, then try killing me. If you want me to admit defeat, it will be impossible,” Chu Feng replied.

“Very well, you have guts. If I do not give you what you want, I, Linghu Hongfei, would feel rather apologetic.”

Although Linghu Hongfei’s oppressive might did not become stronger, the hidden martial power contained within his oppressive might became much stronger after he said those words.

The pain that he was causing Chu Feng increased by at least tenfold.

He wanted Chu Feng to publicly beg for forgiveness, and admit that he was inferior to him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Chu Feng sensed the transformation to the power that had enveloped him. His heart tightened. Yet, he did not cower to the power at all.

Chu Feng knew that, with all those experts present, Linghu Hongfei would definitely not dare to kill him.

Besides, a warrior could be killed, but not be insulted. How could Chu Feng possibly concede to someone as despicable as Linghu Hongfei?

Thus, Chu Feng had prepared himself. He was prepared to be tortured by Linghu Hongfei. Thus, he gritted his teeth with the intention to confront the overwhelming pain.

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, a loud sound was heard.

Following that, the expressions of everyone present changed.

A puff of black gaseous flames was flowing out from Chu Feng’s body. The black gaseous flames had forcibly dispersed Linghu Hongfei’s oppressive might.

“That is?”

It was not only the crowd that was confused. Even Chu Feng himself had a surprised look on his face.

“This aura, it seems to be...” Grandmaster Long Xuan had a shocked look on his face.

“There’s no need to guess, this aura is indeed the aura of an Asura World Spirit,” Liangqiu Chengfeng said.

“In that case, it would mean that young friend Chu Feng is actually an Asura World Spiritist?” Grandmaster Long Xuan asked.

“That is indeed the case,” Liangqiu Chengfeng nodded.

“What an amazing brat. Perhaps his talent in terms of martial cultivation is inferior to Chu Xuanyuan, but his talent in terms of world spirit techniques likely far surpasses Chu Xuanyuan’s, no?” Even Queen Mother Fox Immortal became particularly excited.

Asura World Spiritists were extremely rare.

Although the Ancestral Martial Starfield was an extremely vast place, there were less than ten Asura World Spiritists.

It was a common saying that Divine Bodies were beloved by the heavens.

However, compared to Asura World Spiritists, the number of Divine Bodies was much more numerous. There were so many Divine Bodies that it was simply impossible to count them.

Thus, the people that were capable of becoming Asura World Spiritists were the ones that were truly beloved by the heavens.

“Asura World Spiritist! Chu Feng is actually an Asura World Spiritist?!”

Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others were openly conversing with one another. Thus, the bystanders were able to hear their conversation.

In an instant, the news of Chu Feng being an Asura World Spiritist spread through the crowd, shocking them. Many people even started to envy Chu Feng.

After all, even in a place like the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the identity of being an Asura World Spiritist was still something that people would feel envy toward.

Ignoring their strength, merely the fact that one could become an Asura World Spiritist was already sufficient to make others envious.

That said, the crowd had no idea that, at the same time as they were feeling astonished by Chu Feng’s identity as an Asura World Spiritist, Chu Feng himself was also very astonished.

Chu Feng knew very well where the power coming from his body came from.

It was precisely because of that, that Chu Feng was so puzzled.

“Girl, you’re actually helping me?” Chu Feng asked.

As for the ‘girl’ that Chu Feng spoke of, it was naturally not Her Lady Queen. After all, Her Lady Queen was still dormant in closed-door training.

As such, the person that Chu Feng was questioning was naturally the female world spirit that he had sealed away.

Because he had altered their contract, he was able to restrict her. Whilst being restricted, she would not be able to cause him any harm. However, she was capable of helping him.

That said, Chu Feng never imagined that she would really help him.

Most of all, she was helping him by directly lending her power for him to use.

“Don’t bother with the superfluous words. Take advantage of the fact that this young lady is in a good mood to quickly take care of him.”

“Or else, this young lady might retrieve her power at any moment.”

The female world spirit’s proud voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ears.

“Very well. I understand.”

Chu Feng smiled. Then, he looked at Linghu Hongfei, who stood before him with shock-filled eyes.

Although Chu Feng was still smiling, ruthlessness had emerged in his eyes.
