Chapter 4684: Hidden Dragon Soul Armor

“Is there anything I can do for her?” Chu Feng asked.

He had already taken a close look at Eggy’s condition earlier, but he couldn’t think of anything that he could do in order to help her. He was hoping that Yu Sha, as a fellow world spirit who knew about the Asura God-Demon Stone and Eggy’s condition, would be able to suggest a solution to this.

“None of us can help her. She has to get through this on her own. However, I believe that she should be able to do it. She’s a strong person,” Yu Sha replied.

Chu Feng shot another pained look at Eggy before finally retreating his consciousness out of the World Spirit Space.

He was unable to help Eggy, so the best thing he could do for her was to treasure his life which she had sacrificed herself to save. In order to avoid any complications, he decided to clear the trial as soon as possible.

So, he put his full attention into channeling his bloodline power, and the speed of his descent immediately hastened.

“With such bloodline, there’s no reason to continue the trial anymore.”

However, a moment later, the mysterious voice suddenly sounded in his ears. Following that, his surroundings suddenly distorted, and before he knew it, he returned back to the initial cavern.

It would appear that the mysterious voice knew that Chu Feng would clear the trial, so he decided to end it prematurely. This proved that the mysterious voice was a real person instead of just the formation’s sentience.

“Elder, does this mean that I’ve cleared the trial?”

The answer was clear, but Chu Feng still asked it anyway just to be certain.

“You’ve cleared all six formations, so needless to say, you’ve cleared the trial. Here is your reward.”

A spirit formation gate suddenly opened up before Chu Feng, and an armor floated out from within,

This armor was extremely beautiful. It was made out of a unique crystalline material, but it wasn’t transparent. There were small glimmering bundles of light within the armor, reminiscent of starlight. It felt as if the stars of the galaxy were embodied within the armor.

Most importantly of all, this armor actually emanated the aura of the Ancient Era.

Regardless of its aura, material, or the formation power it harnessed, they were all top-notch. It was worthy of being termed as a treasure amongst treasures.

“A treasure of the Ancient Era?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Chu Feng’s heart jolted in wonderment. He could sense the incredible power harnessed within the armor.

“This is the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor, an item from the Ancient Era. Even though it cannot raise your cultivation swiftly in a short period of time, it’s able to enhance your foundations, be it your intelligence or your talent. If you’re able to nurture this armor to its completion, even the most ordinary of cultivator will be able to soar through the ranks to become a top-level expert. In the hands of a true prodigy, it can create miracles.

“The Hidden Dragon Soul Armor was intended to be bestowed upon the most talented disciple who manages to clear the selection formation, but despite the passing of so many years, you’re the only one who managed to clear it. So, I’ll be giving this armor to you.

“I hope that you won’t let me down,” the mysterious voice said.

“I’ll live up to your expectations, elder. If I may ask, is it possible for you to make some adjustments to the form of the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why do you ask so?” the mysterious voice asked.

“Erm... This Hidden Dragon Soul Armor looks like a treasure that is intended for women. On top of that, it seems to be made out of world spiritist techniques, making it unalterable.”

There was no doubt that the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor was a treasure amongst treasures, but it looked more like a lady’s personal possession. It wasn’t suited for men’s wear.

“This soul armor is indeed made for women. The external appearance can’t be changed, but its size could be altered accordingly. You need not pay it much mind. It’s inner armor anyway, so others wouldn’t be able to see it,” the mysterious voice said.

“Ah... I see.”

Black streaks appeared on Chu Feng’s face. He still felt a little weird wearing something belonging to a woman. If others were to see his inner armor, he might just get mistaken as a pervert.

“What’s with your expression? Are you scorning it? If that’s the case, I’ll take it back,” the mysterious voice said.

“Of course not!”

Chu Feng quickly grabbed the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor, which was floating in midair, over. He quickly took off his shirt and wore it over his body.

“Are you insane? Why are you wearing it right now?”

However, the mysterious voice seemed to be taken aback by Chu Feng’s actions.

“Elder, is there something wrong?”

Chu Feng noticed that something was amiss from the elder’s voice.

Uwa!

Before the mysterious voice could answer the question, Chu Feng already felt great pain assaulting his body. The Hidden Dragon Soul Armor was releasing its energy into the depths of his soul, suffusing his dantian.

He felt his head spinning as unbearable pain devoured him. All it took was a split instant for him to pass out.

...

It took a while before Chu Feng finally woke up. He found that he was still in the cavern, and his body was no longer aching anymore.

However, he immediately realized that something was amiss.

“My cultivation...”

To Chu Feng’s shock, his cultivation had regressed from rank six Utmost Exalted level to rank one Utmost Exalted level!

“Is this the doing of the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor? Wait a moment, it sealed my Three Souls and Seven Essences?” Chu Feng exclaimed.

“You are really too hasty! You wasted such a good opportunity!” the mysterious voice sounded.

“Elder, why did this Hidden Dragon Soul Armor seal my cultivation? Did I do something wrong? Please enlighten me,” Chu Feng asked.

“You’ve indeed done wrong. While the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor is unable to raise your cultivation swiftly in an instant, it should still be able to enhance our cultivation. However, it’s no ordinary treasure, so assimilating it is no easy feat. Before assimilating it, you have to nurture it so that it’s ready to be fused with your soul. The process requires you to link it with your Three Souls and Seven Essences before unlocking them one by one.

“Initially, unlocking the Three Souls and Seven Essences will only help you regain your cultivation. However, in the later stages, it will enhance your cultivation further. Even if you have already reached Half-God level, its effects would still apply.

“Yet, you actually used it when you’re only at Utmost Exalted level. With your current cultivation level, even if you fully unlocked your Three Souls and Seven Essences, you would only reach Martial Exalted level at the very most!

“Just imagine it, if you had reached rank six Half-God and you started nurturing the armor, you would have easily reached the level of a True God once you succeed! You have wasted such a precious opportunity!

“Ahhh, such a treasure has gone to waste just like that! If those old fellows of the world of cultivation were to know about it, they would really want to crack your skull open and see what’s in it!” the mysterious voice exclaimed.

“Elder, why didn’t you say it earlier?”

Chu Feng’s face turned pale upon hearing those words, and he really felt like slapping himself for being too hasty earlier.

This was a treasure that could raise his cultivation to True God level, and yet he wasted it just like that. How could he possibly not feel remorseful?

To make things worse, his purpose of visiting the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was to save Zi Ling, but his cultivation ended regressing before he could even get in.

Even though this mysterious voice said that he would be able to slowly recover and advance his cultivation by unlocking his Three Souls and Seven Essences, he knew that the process was bound to be fraught with difficulties.

“You brat, are you blaming me right now?” the mysterious voice asked coldly.

“I dare not, but it’s just that... To be honest with you, elder, my purpose of entering the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is to save a friend. Now that my cultivation has been sealed, I’m afraid that it’ll be nigh impossible to do so,” Chu Feng revealed his difficulties.

“The person you wish to save is a young lass named Zi Ling, right?” the mysterious voice asked.
