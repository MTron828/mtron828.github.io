MGA: Chapter 788 - Display of Might

“We ten brothers are orphans. Although we were from different parts of the Eastern Sea Region, we received the same cold gazes from others, and received suffering that no people of the same age received.

“Who saved us? It was Lord Qiu Canfeng. He not only saved us, he even taught us cultivation. Not only did he give us power, he gave us privileges as well.

“Without him, we would not be here right now, nor would we be alive today. He treated us with such kindness; should we not serve him with our lives, and serve the Crippling Night Demon Sect?

“But you... you not only forget the given favours, you even, for your own selfish needs, betrayed us brothers, and betrayed everyone from the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Are you even human anymore?!

“Do you know that if Lord Earth King had not arrived, the brothers who have gathered here today with great difficulty would have all died because of you?!”

Old Liu became angrier and angrier as he spoke. His hand also clenched tighter and tighter—it was soon going to snap the Seventh Brother’s neck.

However, as he watched such a scene, the Ninth Immortal who stood next to him didn’t just not help, he even looked as if he were watching a performance as he silently gazed on.

“Ninth Immortal, help me!” Seeing his life soon to end, the Seventh Brother quickly extended his hand and begged the Ninth Immortal for help.

“Help you? Why should I help you? I’m sure you don’t think the Immortal Execution Archipelago would truly accept a dog like you who betrays his master and brothers for glory, right?” The Ninth Immortal faintly smiled, his eyes full of disdain.

“You...” The Seventh Brother of the Gold-cloak Brothers trembled in fury when he heard those words. Even his heart was about to explode.

“Go ahead. I pity you for having a brother like him,” the Ninth Immortal said to Old Liu. But as he spoke, his tone was one of ridicule.

“Seventh Brother, you’ve heard it. This is the Immortal Execution Archipelago, and you want to serve them? Truly too foolish.” However, against all expectations, Old Liu didn’t just leave the Seventh Brother alive. He even released the hand around his throat.

Soon after, he yelled, “Second Brother, Third Brother, Fourth Brother, Fifth Brother, Sixth Brother, Eighth Brother, Ninth Brother, Tenth Brother, attack!”

*whoosh whoosh whoosh...*

Just as he finished speaking, the eight other brothers leapt forward. Surrounding the Ninth Immortal, they sealed all of his possible paths.

“Seventh Brother, I now give you a chance to start anew. Join us nine brothers and kill him,” Old Liu said, pointing at the Ninth Immortal.

“Big Brother, don’t worry. Even if you didn’t say that, I would have still done that.” The Seventh Brother nodded. At that moment, his neck was purple due to being clamped over, but he didn’t blame Old Liu in the slightest. Instead, he cast his eyes filled with hatred towards the Ninth Immortal.

“Hoho? I’ve truly underestimated you ten brothers. Especially you. You really do have a lot of patience. Not only do you keep such a traitor alive, you even kept him alive to aid in handling me. How interesting.

“But, I’m sure you’ve never heard about this: In the Eastern Sea Region, within the realm of Martial Lords, who can defeat me, the Ninth Immortal?

“Not to mention ten of you, even a hundred, a thousand, I would have absolutely no trouble killing all of you,” said the Ninth Immortal with bursting confidence.

“Perhaps before, you were indeed invincible within the realm of Martial Lords, but after meeting us ten brothers, you will know that you are not.” Old Liu coldly smiled, then shouted, “Formation!”

*whoosh whoosh whoosh*

Suddenly, the ten brothers moved simultaneously. They didn’t use any powerful martial skills but the simplest attacks of punches and kicks. That being said, they coordinated with each other extremely well. Their attacks were surprising and abrupt, and their coordination could be said to be perfect—it was many times fiercer than powerful martial skills.

In the instant of exchanging blows, the self-acclaimed existence “invincible within the realm of Martial Lords”, the Ninth Immortal, was powerfully suppressed by the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers. He didn’t even have a chance to use any martial skills.

“Damn. It seems that I’ve truly underestimated you.

“However, you shouldn’t underestimate me. No matter how good your coordination, you will never be able to defeat me.”

Being restrained by ten people he looked down upon put the Ninth Immortal in a very poor mood. He took out an Incomplete Royal Armament, raising his fighting strength—he wanted to finish the fight quickly.

However, he still underestimated the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers. Not only were their attacks profound, their defenses were solid. But, the most important thing was that they had no need to defend because their attacks had completely restrained the Ninth Immortal.

The ten brothers seemed to know exactly what the Ninth Immortal’s next course of actions were. They firmly sealed their hold on his attacks—oppressing him greatly.

At that very instant, the Ninth Immortal even had the heart to curse out loud. He was filled with abilities, but they were all unable to be used. Clearly one punch was the only thing needed to kill a tiger, but at that moment, he could do nothing because of the surrounding nipping of ten ants.

“What a profound formation. This is a true formation. As long as they are coordinated, they don’t need any external power.

“Impressive. This is a formation that only belongs to the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers. It seems that as long as they join hands, there should be no Martial Lords who can defeat them.”

Chu Feng silently observed all of that. He discovered that what the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers used was a formation, but it was different from a Spirit Formation. It was a technique that expanded one’s fighting strength through mutual coordination.

That formation was even more difficult than a Spirit Formation—perhaps several times, even over a hundred times more difficult.

They not only needed a mutual connection, they also needed countless months and years of training. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers to reach such a degree of mutual understanding.

Moreover, the person who designed that formation was clearly not simple either. So, in Chu Feng perspective, even if the Ninth Immortal had some ridiculous technique, he was fated to be defeated by the hands of the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers.

*boom boom boom boom boom...*

“Ahh—”

“Ahh—”

At that moment, in the air above the Depraved Ravine, the war between both sides still continued. They were initially fighting on fairly equal around, but when the Ninth Immortal disappeared, a great reverse happened.

The experts of the Crippling Night Demon Sect had now occupied an absolute advantage; the experts of the Immortal Execution Archipelago now continually cried out, then one after the other, they fell from the sky—killed by the experts of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.

“Dammit! This has been dragged out for so long; what is the Ninth Immortal thinking?” Seeing that happening, Murong Xun lightly knitted his brows, some displeasure appearing on his face.

“Haha, Murong Xun, the momentum your Immortal Execution Archipelago had is now gone! Today, you will die here,” said Xuan Xiaochao, laughing loudly.

“Murong Xun, your fiancée and sister aren’t too bad! In a while, we’ll consider leaving them alive to reward our bravely fought brothers.” You Tonghan even shamelessly swept his gaze at the distant, towards Ya Fei and Murong Wan who were also participating in the battle.

“Hmph. Three pieces of trash truly think they can compete with me?

“I am merely playing around with all of you. Now, I’ve had enough. I’ll immediately let you all know who is the true king of the Eastern Sea Region’s young generation.”

Suddenly, Murong Xun’s complexion turned cold. With a flick of his wrist, a silver spear appeared within his hand. In the instant it appeared, even the colour of the sky changed. Almost everyone felt an incomparable pressure descending from above.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
