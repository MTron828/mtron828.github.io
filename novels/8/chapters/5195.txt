Chapter 5195: Chu Feng’s Defeat

“I find it much more upsetting to lose that blue rock. Return it to me, Xue Ji. I don’t want to make a move on you,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re scum, Chu Feng. You’re telling me now that you don’t want to make a move when you just tried to attack me?” Xue Ji scoffed.

“I just want to take back the rock. I have no intention of hurting you,” Chu Feng replied.

“I’m afraid that you won’t be able to take the rock back without hurting me,” Xue Ji replied with a seductive smile.

Her smile with that impeccably beautiful face of hers was so enchanting that it could steal the souls of men, but Chu Feng wasn’t in the mood to admire her beauty. He knew that Xue Ji wouldn’t return the rock to him if he didn’t take her seriously.

“You’re forcing my hand, Xue Ji.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Tzlala!

Lightning crackled around Chu Feng, and a Lightning Mark formed on his forehead. A divine aura slowly emanated from him as the avatar of four sacred beasts manifested out of thin air.

Employing the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and the Four Symbols Divine Power simultaneously raised Chu Feng’s cultivation from rank eight Martial Exalted level till he was two ranks above rank nine Martial Exalted level. This put him on par with Xue Ji.

Chu Feng’s spirit power had also reached the same level, but he noticed that Xue Ji wasn’t an easy opponent. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to fend against his earlier attack so easily. While he was also adept in world spiritist techniques, he was much more proficient in martial combat.

After raising his cultivation, Chu Feng also whipped out his Immemorial Hero’s Sword, further raising his fighting prowess.

“That Exalted Armament you have there is not too bad,” Xue Ji remarked.

She didn’t raise an eyebrow at all despite Chu Feng employing his means. This showed her absolute confidence here.

“Pardon me, Xue Ji.”

Shoosh!

Chu Feng rushed at Xue Ji with his Exalted Armement. He didn’t use any martial skill because he didn’t want to hurt Xue Ji.

Shoosh!

Xue Ji flicked his wrist and manifested a black sword in his hand. This black sword was a special weapon that could only be used by world spirits, and it harnessed tremendous power too. In no way did it pale in comparison to Chu Feng’s Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

The two of them charged at each other, reaching the striking distance of each other within a split second.

Chu Feng didn’t directly brandish his Immemorial Hero’s Sword to attack Xue Ji—he had merely equipped it in order to raise his fighting prowess. Instead, he raised his hand and unleashed a powerful absorption force, hoping to take back the rock that Xue Ji had stolen from him.

While the rock was of a different shape from before, it retained its previous properties of being unable to be stowed away. This meant that Xue Ji could only keep it floating around her.

Despite Chu Feng’s attempt to pull the rock in his direction, the rock wasn’t moving in the slightest.

Shoosh!

With a cold gleam, Xue Ji’s black sword swooped across the air to slice down on Chu Feng’s palm. Even though Chu Feng was going easy on Xue Ji, the latter wasn’t reciprocating at all.

It was fortunate that Chu Feng was prepared for her attack. He quickly retracted his left hand while pulling the Immemorial Hero’s Sword upward at the same time to deflect her black sword.

However, Xue Ji suddenly changed the trajectory of her cut, redirecting it from Chu Feng’s left hand to his neck. To make things worse, there was an abrupt acceleration in her sword.

The earlier attack was only a feint. This was her true intention.

Chu Feng was impressed by her maneuver. He could tell that an extremely high level of precision was required to carry out this movement.

Caught off guard by this sudden transformation in her attack, he had no choice but to attempt to evade. Despite moving as quickly as he could, the black sword ended up nicking his neck. In fact, he would have been beheaded if not for his Immemorial Hero’s Sword arriving in the nick of time to deflect Xue Ji’s black sword.

This injury stoked Chu Feng’s fighting will. He knew that he couldn’t afford to go easy on Xue Ji anymore, or else he might lose his life here.

Thus, he utilized the powerful swordsmanship that he had comprehended during his fight with Jiang Yuantai. Yet, to his surprise, he wasn’t able to hurt Xue Ji in the least.

It turned out that Xue Ji’s ability to maneuver the sword was nowhere beneath him.

“Your swordsmanship is not too bad. Where did you learn it from?” Xue Ji asked.

“I comprehended it myself,” Chu Feng replied.

“You comprehended it yourself? Hoh, you’re more competent than I thought,” Xue Ji replied with a smile.

A few moments later, Chu Feng suddenly found that he was struggling in the fight. It was not that Xue Ji’s attacks were getting more powerful but that he was slowly growing weaker. Both his strength and speed were languishing. Even breathing was starting to get difficult for him.

Realizing that something was amiss, Chu Feng quickly backed away.

Nevertheless, the feeling of weakness was still swiftly spreading throughout his body.

“Your sword is poisoned?” Chu Feng asked.

“Your body and soul are stronger than I thought. You must have eaten quite a lot of antidote, or else you wouldn’t have been able to hold on for that long. However, the poison I have here isn’t any ordinary poison either. It’s from the Asura Spirit World. There is no one in the world who can treat it, and death is the only fate awaiting those who have been afflicted with it,” Xue Ji replied.

Chu Feng immediately took out all of the antidotes he had inside his Cosmos Sack while constructing a recovery formation, hoping to treat his poison. However, it didn’t take him long to fall limply to the ground. None of his antidotes or formations were working at all.

Xue Ji’s poison was truly potent.

Pah!

A jade bottle suddenly dropped right in front of Chu Feng.

“It’d be boring if you died right now. Chu Feng, you shouldn’t be so careless the next time we cross blows. I… am not as weak as you think. Remember, you owe me your life,” Xue Ji said before walking away.

Chu Feng quickly uncorked the jade bottle and found a pill inside. He quickly swallowed it, and it immediately started neutralizing the potent poison ravaging his body. After the poison had been neutralized, he carefully examined his body to check if there were any side effects.

Fortunately, there were none.

He felt deeply fearful just thinking about what could have happened. He was foolish to have underestimated Xue Ji, and it nearly caused his death.

He had encountered plenty of poisons during his journey, but he had always been able to neutralize them. He had even acquired the Hundred Poisons Unapproach Body from a fortuitous encounter. It was just that the Poison Immunity Constitution was only useful for mild poisons from Ordinary Realms and Lower Realms.

As he rose through the ranks, his Hundred Poisons Unapproach Body slowly lost its effectiveness. As a result, he had been poisoned several more times afterward.

Nevertheless, he had never encountered any poison as frightening as Xue Ji’s. He could feel just how close he had come to death earlier on. If not for Xue Ji’s antidote, he would have surely died here today.
