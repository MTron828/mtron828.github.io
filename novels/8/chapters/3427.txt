Chapter 3427 - Appearing On The Ice Summit

After a moment of silence, loud bursts of laughter started being heard.

“Old Monster, that joke of yours is a bit too excessive.”

“Everyone knows Chu Xuanyuan’s son has already died.”

It turned out that the crowd simply did not believe Old Monster Kunmen. They all felt that he was joking with them.

“Chu Feng simply hasn’t died. Furthermore, that child’s talent is extremely strong. Although not as brilliant as Chu Xuanyuan back then, he is still definitely a rare demon-level genius. Likely, apart from Linghu Hongfei, no one among the current younger generations would be able to match him,” Old Monster Kunmen spoke with a deadpan expression.

“Humph. Old Monster, it’s fine to make jokes. However, if you are to take us as fools, it would be quite excessive.”

However, the crowd simply did not believe Old Monster Kunmen, and their smiling faces all turned gloomy.

Seeing their reaction, Old Monster Kunmen sighed and shook his head helplessly. He stopped trying to explain.

No matter what, Old Monster Kunmen was a person with some status. He was not someone fond of joking around. However, whenever he mentioned how astonishing Chu Feng was, apart from his closest friends, no one believed him.

Thus, Old Monster Kunmen was already accustomed to such a reaction from the crowd.

Sometimes, rumors would become true over time.

The rumors that Chu Feng had died had been in circulation for a very long time and people had talked about it all these years. As such, they had already accepted it as truth.. If someone were to suddenly emerge and say that Chu Feng was still alive, they would instead feel it to be a rumor.

“Look! What’s that?!”

Suddenly, cries of alarm sounded from the crowd. The alarmed sounds rapidly spread through the crowd. In merely a short moment, the vast crowd that covered both the sky and the ground were all covered in astonishment. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Under such circumstances, Old Monster Kunmen and the others soon noticed that something was actually flying down from the Ice Summit.

It was a body of light. It was very dazzling, and looked like a small-scale sun as it shone gloriously, bathing its surroundings in light. As soon as it appeared, the entire region became particularly bright.

The brightness was so intense that not even those cultivators were able to clearly see through it.

If those with weak cultivations were to stare directly at the bright light, they would definitely feel their eyes being dazzled with stinging pain.

“What is that?”

Due to Exalted Heavenly Fate’s prophecy, the Ice Summit was deemed as a mysterious place. As such, the crowd were all surprised by the unknown source of light, that had suddenly appeared.

After all, that unknown light source itself was very strange to begin with.

The body of light only floated in midair for a short moment before the intense light it emitted started to wane.

At that moment, the actual appearance of the body of light appeared in the crowd’s field of view.

“That seems to be a person. Why is he emitting light all over? Could it be... he’s not human, but instead a monstrous beast? Or could it be that it’s a natural oddity?”

“No, everyone, look carefully at the cloak that it’s wearing. There are nine dragons on it. Furthermore, it’s emitting Saint-level spirit power. Could it be... is that the legendary Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?”

“Nine Dragons Saint Cloak? Wasn’t it said that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was merely an ordinary white cloak that floated above the grand formation and could not be obtained? Unless...”

“Heavens! Could it be that someone has managed to breach the grand formation and obtained the legendary Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?”

Suddenly, the sea of people that covered the sky and earth all burst into an uproar.

Everyone knew that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was a treasure left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King. It was because of that treasure that the Ice Summit was known to be one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Three Great Eccentrics’ Remnants.

The appearance of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak meant that the grand formation had been breached, and that there would only be two Great Eccentrics’ Remnants from that moment onward.

“Who is it that managed to breach the grand formation left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King? According to the rumors... that World Spiritist Immortal King was a God-cloak World Spiritist.”

“The many peak experts of our Ancestral Martial Starfield have all attempted to breach the formation before. However, they all ended up failing. Yet today, the grand formation was actually breached. Exactly who is capable of such a feat?”

“Look at those veined patterns. That’s Insect Mark spirit power. If it’s an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, our Ancestral Martial Starfield only has those few. Exactly which one of them was it?”

“I think that it should be Liangqiu Chengfeng. As Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciple, he is the strongest amongst the Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.”

“That shouldn’t be the case. Not even Grandmaster Liangqiu was able to breach the grand formation, so how could Liangqiu Chengfeng be able to?”

“That’s reasonable. In that case, exactly who is it?”

“Since a person capable of breaching the grand formation is not present within our Ancestral Martial Starfield, I think... that person is not someone from our Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“What? It’s an outsider?”

“This...”

Upon reaching such a guess, the crowd’s excitement became complicated.

If it were someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield that had managed to obtain the treasured Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, they would naturally be very excited. After all, it would mean that they’d witnessed a historic moment. Even if it wasn’t them that had obtained the treasure, they would still be able to boast about what they’d witnessed for the rest of their lives.

However, if the person that had breached the grand formation wasn’t someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, their excitement would immediately disappear.

As the saying went, one would not wish to let others obtain the goods from one’s family. As such, the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield were naturally hopeful that their Ancestral Martial Starfield’s treasure would be obtained by someone from their Ancestral Martial Starfield.

If an outsider was to obtain their treasure, it would be very humiliating for the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Whilst the crowd were all guessing, there were two figures hidden within the shadows and closely watching Chu Feng, who was standing in midair.

They were Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan.

The two of them had immediately chased after Chu Feng the moment they discovered that he had disappeared, but they had never expected that they would find him there.

Upon discovering him, the two of them had immediately attempted to converse with him through voice transmission, and ask him about his situation. However... they did not receive a response.

“Grandmaster, did young friend Chu Feng respond to you?” Grandmaster Long Xuan asked.

“No,” Grandmaster Liangqiu shook his head. Then, he looked to Grandmaster Long Xuan, “What about you?”

“No,” Grandmaster Long Xuan also shook his head, “Grandmaster, young friend Chu Feng is not someone without manners. For him to not respond to us, could something have happened to him?”

“I don’t think so,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“Then why isn’t he responding?” Grandmaster Long Xuan asked.

“Perhaps young friend Chu Feng has his own plans. Let us continue watching,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“Look! He moved!”

Right at that moment, the crowd burst into another uproar. They had discovered that the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was moving.

“Grandmaster, I’m afraid that young friend Chu Feng will be leaving again,” Grandmaster Long Xuan said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, exactly what are you trying to do?” Grandmaster Liangqiu started to frown. He didn’t understand what was wrong with Chu Feng.

Through examining Chu Feng with his spirit power, he was certain that there was nothing wrong with him. It could even be said that he was very normal; that he was fine.

Thus, he did not understand exactly what was going on with him.

“There’s no time to consider it all. Perhaps this is an opportunity,” Grandmaster Long Xuan said.

“Opportunity? Opportunity for what?” Grandmaster Liangqiu looked to Grandmaster Long Xuan upon hearing those words. However, once he did that, he discovered that Grandmaster Long Xuan had actually disappeared.

After searching around, Grandmaster Liangqiu discovered that Grandmaster Long Xuan, who was originally hidden with him, had revealed himself, and was even standing before Chu Feng.

“Long Xuan, could you be...?!”

Seeing Grandmaster Long Xuan’s action, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s expression changed. He appeared to have realized that the situation was bad.
