Chapter 3527 - Kong Tianhui’s Strength

“This young master is unable to take defeat with grace?”

“This young master only fears that you will be beaten up so badly that you’ll be looking for your teeth all over the floor and crying, running home, and looking for your mother.”

“Woosh~~~”

As Kong Tianhui spoke, he took out an item and raised his arm. Light immediately filled that item as it soared into the air. It was a circular geometric compass.

Kong Tianhui leaped forth and stood on the center of that compass.

“Come up to this compass and try attacking me. I will not counterattack. As long as you can push me from this compass, it’ll be your win,” he said.

“What arrogance.”

At that moment, the crowd all felt that Kong Tianhui was simply too arrogant. The compass only had a radius of several hundred meters. This distance was so short that any powerful attack would be able to push him out.

For Kong Tianhui to dare say that sort of thing, and to say it to Chu Feng, who had tied with Linghu Hongfei, he was not merely arrogant, he was extremely arrogant.

That said, at the same time, the crowd were unable to keep themselves from thinking that Kong Tianhui must know about Chu Feng’s accomplishments, since he dared to come challenge him.

Since he dared to come challenge him even after knowing how strong he was, it naturally meant that Kong Tianhui had come prepared.

Thus, since he dared to act so arrogantly, exactly... what sort of capability did he possess?

At this moment, the crowd felt their blood boiling.

The crowd were thinking, ‘Could it be that there are truly people of the younger generation within the Three Cities that are so heaven-defying that not even Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei would be a match for them?’

At the moment when the crowd were astonished by Kong Tianhui’s arrogance, Chu Feng’s gaze was focused on that compass.

“What’s wrong? Do you not dare to come up?” Kong Tianhui mocked upon seeing that Chu Feng was somewhat hesitant.

The crowd also turned their gazes to Chu Feng. This was especially true for the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, as there was a sign of longing in their eyes.

They were all hoping for Chu Feng to fight Kong Tianhui.

The people that came to offer congratulations were all people that had witnessed Chu Feng’s strength. However, the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm did not know exactly what sort of strength he currently possessed.

They all wanted to see exactly how far the youngster Chu Feng had matured.

Kong Tianhui’s challenge served as a rare opportunity for them to gain the answer to their questions.

“What did you just say?” Chu Feng finally turned his gaze from the compass to Kong Tianhui.

“If you’re afraid to accept my challenge, you can just say it directly. There is no need for you to pretend to be a fool,” Kong Tianhui smiled coldly.

“Afraid? There is no such word in my dictionary,” Chu Feng also smiled. That smile of his was filled with contempt.

“Woosh~~~”

With a leap of his body, Chu Feng stepped onto the compass.

Seeing that Chu Feng had landed on the compass, a strange expression flashed through Kong Tianhui’s eyes. He said, “Chu Feng, you’ve lost.”

The crowd were all confused by his words. They did not understand why Kong Tianhui would be so confident as he said those words.

“Buzz~~~”

In the next moment, Kong Tianhui’s clothes began to flutter.

Finally, he had unleashed his concealed cultivation.

Rank one Exalted. That Kong Tianhui was actually a rank one Exalted.

“A rank one Exalted at such a young age?”

“Amazing. As expected of the Divine Body Royal City’s strongest person of the younger generation.”

After sensing Kong Tianhui’s cultivation, the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were all filled with astonishment. As for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they all began to worry for Chu Feng.

Even the Goldenstone Royal Clan and the Hong Beast Clan were astonished by how powerful that Kong Tianhui was.

The great majority of the so-called geniuses in the Ancestral Martial Starfield were actually only True Immortals. Those capable of reaching the Martial Immortal level of cultivation were all deemed to be demon-level geniuses. As for the Exalted realm, that would be beyond imagination. After all, even the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief was only a rank one Exalted.

The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief had cultivated for many years, and was also the ruler of an Upper Realm. There was no need to doubt his status. Furthermore, he was someone who had been deemed a genius since his youth.

Yet, even after training for all those years, his cultivation was only that of a rank one Exalted.

And now, a person of the younger generation that was less than a hundred years old also possessed the cultivation of an Exalted. How could the crowd not be astonished by him?

The disparity between their talents caused the crowd to feel endless envy.

“That’s not enough.”

At the moment when the crowd were astonished by Kong Tianhui’s cultivation, there were actually people shaking their heads and sighing.

Those were all the people that came from various powers to congratulate the Chu Heavenly Clan.

They were all people that had witnessed the battle between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei.

They admitted that Kong Tianhui was indeed a heaven-defying genius to be able to obtain such a cultivation at his age. If Kong Tianhui were to challenge anyone else from the Ancestral Martial Decastars, he would definitely be able to obtain victory with ease.

Unfortunately, the person he had challenged was Chu Feng. In the eyes of those people, they felt that Kong Tianhui was far from being able to challenge Chu Feng.

After all, even Linghu Hongfei, a rank two Exalted who possessed numerous heaven-defying abilities, was unable to defeat Chu Feng.

“You said that I’ve lost. How can you be so certain?” Chu Feng asked.

“The disparity between our cultivation is obvious at a glance. Tell me, what makes you think you haven’t lost?” Kong Tianhui looked to Chu Feng with a mocking expression. It was as if he was looking at a clown. His gaze was truly offending.

However, although he was faced with such an arrogant Kong Tianhui, Chu Feng was not at all angered. Instead, he asked, “So, if I am to make you leave the range of this compass, I’ll have won?”

“That’s right. That’s precisely it. You can give it a try,” Kong Tianhui shrugged. He was extremely confident. He was acting as if Chu Feng could attack him at will, and would be able to win should he even make him move half a step.

“Very well,” As Chu Feng spoke, boundless spirit power was released from him.

“That spirit power is so strong!” Once Chu Feng released his spirit power, the crowd’s eyes were all captured by it.

“That’s Saint-level spirit power. It’s naturally very powerful,” said Tantai Yinjian.

“Ah? Saint-level spirit power? Wouldn’t it mean...”

Complicated expressions filled the crowd’s faces. Some were so astonished that their jaws dropped.

“Before the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Exalted Heavenly Fate had prophesied that the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the history of the Ancestral Martial Starfield would appear on the Nine Dragons Upper Realm’s Ice Summit.”

“As for that person, he is none other than young friend Chu Feng.”

“Not only did young friend Chu Feng become the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the history of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but he also managed to breach the spirit formation left by the World Spiritist Immortal King on the Ice Summit to obtain the legendary treasure there, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak,” Tantai Yinjian added.

At that moment, even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s jaw dropped with shock.

They already knew that Chu Feng possessed exceptional talent. However, no one had expected his growth to be so fast.

Not only did his cultivation advance by leaps and bounds, but his world spirit techniques actually reached the unprecedented Saint-cloak World Spiritist level too. In fact, he had even obtained the treasure left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

Compared to Chu Xuanyuan’s heaven-defying talent that was shown since he was a child, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief felt that Chu Feng’s rapid growth in such a short period of time was even more astonishing.

“Wuuu~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s body trembled. Then, he took several steps backwards. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Chu Feng!!!”

Seeing Chu Feng like that, worried expressions filled the Chu Heavenly Clansmen’s faces.

At that moment, Chu Feng was not only completely pale, but the spirit power he had released was actually sucked away.

What sucked Chu Feng’s spirit power away was the compass that he was standing on.

“Something’s fishy about that compass!”

At that moment, the crowd all realized it.
