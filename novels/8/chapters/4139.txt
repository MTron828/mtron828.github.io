Chapter 4139 - Complete Chaos

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, Zuoqiu Daoyi’s expression became even more twisted.

The thing he was incapable of tolerating the most his whole life was being looked down on by others.

Today, Chu Feng had accomplished the feat of looking down on him with contempt to the fullest extent.

In his entire life, everyone had addressed him as a genius.

Never had he received as much contempt as he did from Chu Feng.

“Good. Very good. Since you’re this arrogant, I’ll have you experience the might of my Exalted Taboo: Black Lightning Attachment.”

Zuoqiu Daoyi pointed his sword at Chu Feng.

“Zzzzz~~~”

Following the sword, black lightning soared out and made a straight line for Chu Feng like a dragon.

The lightning was extremely violent. It seemed to be from hell itself.

“Zzzzzz~~~”

However, before the black lightning could even approach Chu Feng, countless blood-red lightning bolts struck down from the clouds above.

Although the blood-red lightning’s might was not as strong as the black lightning, its power was actually several times more terrifying.

Not only did the blood-red lightning block Zuoqiu Daoyi’s black lightning, but it was even striking down at Zuoqiu Daoyi repeatedly.

The constant lightning strikes were simply never-ending.

Zuoqiu Daoyi was forced to dodge the incoming lightning without stopping.

As matters stood, he had realized that even though the blood-red lightning was from an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill, it was extremely powerful. If he were to be struck, he would either die or be seriously injured.

Zuoqiu Daoyi’s current appearance as he tried his hardest to avoid the incoming lightning strikes cut a sorry figure.

This scene was observed by everyone from the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, and made them extremely pained.

Zuoqiu Daoyi, their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s current strongest member of the younger generation, not only had his Exalted Taboo Martial Skill blocked by his opponent using only an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill, but he was also left in such a sorry state that he was fleeing for his life under the constant threat of that Immortal Taboo Martial Skill.

Fortunately, no one else saw this. Else, it would be utterly humiliating.

Unfortunately for them, this scene was actually witnessed by outsiders.

They were the Dragon Clan’s girl and old man standing above the clouds.

“That guy’s name is Chu Feng, right?”

“What a powerful fellow.”

“Under the same sort of cultivation, perhaps not even I would be a match for him,” said that girl.

“It’s the first time I’ve seen you give such an evaluation of someone of your generation,” said the old man.

“I’ve always made fair evaluations,” said the girl.

“Is that so?” The old man smiled.

He knew this girl too well.

She was someone that looked down on everyone of her generation.

“How come I’ve never heard of such a powerful fellow before? Could he be from another galaxy?” the girl asked in a puzzled manner.

“Most likely not. If he’s a genius from another galaxy, he would definitely be protected by his clan’s experts in our Holy Light Galaxy.”

“Judging from the current circumstances, he doesn’t seem to be protected.”

“He had been made a Lightning Guide, yet no one showed up to protect him.”

“It’s all because he managed to take on the Divine Lightning Affliction. If he had failed to withstand it, he would’ve died in there,” said the old man.

“Grandpa Bu, if it’s as you say, wouldn’t that mean this Chu Feng came from an unknown clan in the Holy Light Galaxy?” asked the girl.

“That’s very possible,” said the old man.

“That’s bad. Even if he’s able to defeat the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations with his current strength, he still won’t be able to take on the entire Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan.”

“Once the power of the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation dissipates, wouldn’t he be doomed?” said the girl.

“Look at how confident that child is.”

“He’s either made the resolution to die, or has a way to handle the upcoming situation.”

“That said, we’ll have to see exactly what he’ll do...”

As the old man from the Dragon Clan spoke, his gaze focused on the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.

The reason for that was because the battle between Chu Feng and Zuoqiu Daoyi was still ongoing.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Zuoqiu Daoyi came to a stop.

Then, he pointed his sword toward the sky.

WIth that, a gray beam of light shot out from his sword straight into the sky.

Not only did the gray beam of light block several incoming bolts of blood lightning, but it also pierced into the clouds, and scattered them.

After dispersing the lightning clouds covering the sky, Zuoqiu Daoyi pulled back his sword.

However, his sword was still emitting a dazzling yet strange gray light.

Like the black lightning from earlier, a sort of power had been attached to his sword.

The only difference was that the gray light was clearly stronger than the black lightning.

Like the black lightning, the gray light was also an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

Merely, it was a rank two Exalted Taboo.

“Die!”

Suddenly, Zuoqiu Daoyi attacked again. He thrust his sword at Chu Feng.

The gray beam that had destroyed the blood lightning clouds shot straight toward Chu Feng.

The only difference was that the gray beam had completely separated itself from Zuoqiu Daoyi’s sword. With that, its might grew even fiercer.

If the beam that had dispersed the lightning clouds earlier was a casual attack, then this beam was a full-powered attack.

However, facing the incoming gray beam, Chu Feng did not bother to dodge.

Instead, he shouted, “Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal!”

With that, Chu Feng pulled his palm to his chest then shot it forth explosively.

“Rumble~~~”

An enormous hand of light measuring over ten thousand meters in height took form before Chu Feng and shot straight toward Zuoqiu Daoyi’s Exalted Taboo.

“Rumble~~~”

The two Exalted Taboos collided, and brought forth devastating energy ripples.

Neither the giant hand of light nor the gray beam of light were able to defeat the other.

As the two martial skills collided, they canceled one another out.

However, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen found this outcome difficult to accept.

Apart from their might, one could determine the rank of an Exalted Taboo through its color.

The rank one Exalted Taboo Zuoqiu Daoyi had used earlier was named Exalted Taboo: Black Lightning Attachment.

That was a very special kind of Exalted Taboo Martial Skill. Because of that, the lighting was black.

However, in normal cases, a rank one Exalted Taboo would generally come in white.

The Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal Chu Feng had used earlier was white.

Besides the colors, one could also determine the ranks of an Exalted Taboo through the might they emitted.

Because of that, practically everyone determined that Chu Feng’s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal was a rank one Exalted Taboo.

But, the gray beam of light Zuoqiu Daoyi had used was a rank two Exalted Taboo.

This meant that Chu Feng not only took out Zuoqiu Daoyi’s rank one Exalted Taboo with an Immortal Taboo, but he also took out Zuoqiu Daoyi’s rank two Exalted Taboo with a rank one Exalted Taboo.

Even if there was a disparity in the strength of Exalted Taboos, the disparity could not be this great.

A rank one would be a rank one, and a rank two would be a rank two. They were two completely different ranks, and there was an enormous disparity in their strengths.

It should be impossible for a rank one Exalted Taboo to block a rank two Exalted Taboo.

Yet, this impossible feat was accomplished by Chu Feng.

They all knew that the reason why Chu Feng was able to do this was because he possessed extremely strong battle power.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, Zuoqiu Daoyi attacked again. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The manner of his attack was identical to his earlier attacks.

He was once again attacking Chu Feng with a thrust of his sword.

The only difference was what shot out from his sword. It was neither black lightning nor a gray beam of light. Instead, it was a silver sword aura.

The sword aura took the shape of a half moon, and measured over twenty thousand meters.

As Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen, they immediately recognized what that attack was.

That was their rank three Exalted Taboo: Half Moon Slash!

Yet, facing the rank three Exalted Taboo, Chu Feng actually made the same motion as before.

He first placed his palm onto his chest, and then sent it forth explosively.

Like before, he shouted, “Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal!”

With a loud rumble, a ten thousand-meter giant hand of light appeared again, and flew straight toward the incoming Exalted Taboo: Half Moon Slash.

The two collided, and sent forth devastating energy ripples.

In the end, both attacks dissipated into thin air.

The outcome was the same as when the giant hand of light collided with the gray beam of light.

“This...”

This scene completely stupefied the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen. They were stunned by what had just occurred.

Chu Feng’s attack didn’t change. It was still a rank one Exalted Taboo.

Yet, Zuoqiu Daoyi’s attack was a rank three Exalted Taboo.

When Chu Feng’s rank one Exalted Taboo managed to take on Zuoqiu Daoyi’s rank two Exalted Taboo, they were still slightly capable of accepting it.

However, when they witnessed a rank one Exalted Taboo blocking a rank three Exalted Taboo...

... their thoughts were in complete chaos...
