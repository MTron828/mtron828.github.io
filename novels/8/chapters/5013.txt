Chapter 5013: An Opportunity

“Trickery? Even those from the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber have acknowledged that I have deciphered the True Dragon Chessboard, but you still continue to claim that I have resorted to trickery? Is this how the sect members of the Heavenwind Sword Sect conduct themselves? It looks like there’s no point keeping this token anymore.”

Chu Feng threw the token he had just received from Chu Guyu onto the floor.

“Hmph! That little show of yours can only deceive that naive junior of mine. Chu Feng, I won’t take advantage of me. Tell me what’s your cultivation level and I’ll suppress my cultivation to your level. We’ll have a fair battle. If you dare not even do that much, you might as well admit your mistakes. Otherwise, you need not dream of leaving this place safely!” Li Han spoke forcefully.

He sounded more arrogant than he was back at the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber, presumably because he had the backing of the black-haired elder now.

Chu Feng glanced at the Netherworld Envoy and saw that the latter wasn’t reacting at all. That being said, it was unlikely that the Netherworld Envoy would let Chu Feng die.

That was why Chu Feng didn’t have much fear even though the black-haired elder from the Heavenwind Sword Sect was a Half-God level cultivator.

“You’re at rank five Martial Exalted level, right? There’s no need for you to suppress your cultivation. I can defeat you without that.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he released his rank four Martial Exalted level cultivation.

“That brat… He’s actually a rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator? I couldn’t tell at all.”

The disciples of the Heavenwind Sword Sect were shocked by Chu Feng’s cultivation. Even the Half-God level black-haired elder looked at him in a different light.

“He might be a rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator, but he’s clearly no match for the rank five Martial Exalted level Senior Li. His head must have gotten clogged with water to accept the fight with Senior Li!”

“Indeed. Senior Li already offered to lower his cultivation, but that fool actually refused. He’s courting his own death!”

It didn’t take long for the disciples of the Heavenwind Sword Sect to continue insulting Chu Feng once more. They had the utmost confidence in Li Han’s strength.

Chu Feng might have stood a chance if they were of the same cultivation level, but there was a rank of difference here. No matter how they looked at it, there was no way Chu Feng could win the battle.

“Brat, are you sure about this? I don’t plan on holding back at all. Are you sure you want to fight me at my full strength?”

Even Li Han also looked at Chu Feng in disbelief.

Tzlala!

A Lightning Mark appeared on Chu Feng’s forehead, raising his cultivation from rank four to rank five Martial Exalted level.

“You’re too noisy. I don’t want to waste my time with you. If you don’t want to fight, get lost!” Chu Feng said impatiently.

“No wonder you’re so arrogant. It looks like you’ve cultivated the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. However, if you think that you can defeat me with just this much, you’re overestimating yourself!”

Shoosh!

With a flash of light, Li Han began charging toward Chu Feng. The latter let out a sneer and began rushing forth too.

Boom boom boom!

Their martial power clashed against each other, producing a series of explosions.

The crowd expected an intense battle, but it didn’t take long for the curtains to be drawn on the fight. Li Han was sent flying with blood trailing from his lips. The hand he was holding his Exalted Armament with had been fractured. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

What was shocking about this was that Li Han’s current cultivation wasn’t at rank five Martial Exalted level but rank seven!

Li Han possessed a Divine Power and had cultivated the Heavenwind Sword Sect’s mysterious technique too. On top of that, he even consumed a forbidden medicine. Thanks to that, he was able to raise his cultivation by two ranks.

Yet, despite the rise in his cultivation, he still ended up falling in defeat within moments.

Chu Feng stood in the sky with the Immemorial Hero’s Sword in his grasp, gazing down on Li Han from above. His imposing presence intimidated the disciples of the Heavenwind Sword Sect.

To their horror, Chu Feng’s cultivation had also reached rank seven Martial Exalted level too.

On top of his Lightning Mark, he was wearing the Lightning Armor and emanating the aura of the Four Symbols Divine Power. It was due to these abilities that Chu Feng dared to accept Li Han’s duel.

It was just that no one had expected Chu Feng to be this powerful. Even the Netherworld Envoy was surprised as well.

“How could I be unaware that such a formidable child has appeared in the Eastern Region!”

The Netherworld Envoy looked at Chu Feng with a hint of delight in his eyes.

On the other hand, Chu Feng wasn’t surprised by the result of the battle at all. There was no joy on his face because he knew that this matter wasn’t over yet. After all, the real trouble here wasn’t Li Han but the Half-God level black-haired elder.

The elder hadn’t made a move or said a single word thus far, but it was clear from his vicious face that he was planning to stand up for Li Han.

“Li Han, hurry up and apologize to this young hero.”

The black-haired elder finally spoke up, but his words caught Chu Feng by surprise. Instead of standing up for Li Han, he urged the latter to apologize to Chu Feng instead.

“I admit defeat. I apologize for my earlier offense.”

Li Han obediently stood back up and apologized to Chu Feng.

While Chu Feng was still confused as to what was going on, another two more figures appeared. They were Chu Guyu and the unfathomable elder he had met earlier in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber.

“Young master Chu Feng, I apologize for this. You were simply too mysterious, so I wanted to try deducing your background from your martial skill. I don’t mean any ill-will. I ask you not to blame Senior Li Han for this. We have no intention of making things difficult for you even if you had lost the earlier battle,” Chu Guyu said.

That enlightened Chu Feng to the truth.

It turned out that this was all Chu Guyu’s doing. The Heavenwind Sword Sect wasn’t trying to get even with Chu Feng; they were just trying to probe Chu Feng to figure out which power he belonged to.

Chu Guyu raised her hand, and the honorary guest token that Chu Feng had thrown onto the ground earlier flew into her grasp. She glanced at the token before stowing it away.

“The honorary guest token isn’t worthy of young master Chu Feng considering the talent you have displayed. If you don’t mind, please accept this instead.”

Chu Guyu took out another token and handed it to Chu Feng.

It was another invitation token, but it was the exalted guest token this time around.

Its significance was vastly different from that of the honorary guest token. Only the most esteemed of guests would be qualified to receive it.

“Young master Chu Feng and this elder over here, I’d like to apologize once more for the earlier transgression from our Heavenwind Sword Sect.”

After Chu Feng accepted the invitation token, Chu Guyu bowed once more to Chu Feng and the Netherworld Envoy as a show of apology.

The truth was that Chu Feng was angry at the Heavenwind Sword Sect’s actions even though they didn’t mean any ill-will, but he knew that this wasn’t the time for him to lose his temper. On the contrary, this was actually an opportunity for him.

Chu Guyu’s actions were inappropriate, but they did show how highly she thought of Chu Feng. After her earlier transgression, it could be said that she owed one to Chu Feng.

If he were to make a request of her right now, she might not necessarily reject it.

Thus, Chu Feng gritted his teeth and sent a voice transmission to Chu Guyu.
