Chapter 3810 - Deception

“So-so,” Chu Feng spoke in a very calm manner.

“So-so? Heh...”

Hearing those words, that person let out a cold chuckle. Then, his clothes started to flutter, and the spirit power that had enveloped his body rushed towards Chu Feng to attack him.

He was evidently angered by Chu Feng’s reaction. Thus, he wanted to make him pay.

However, although his spirit power swept past Chu Feng, it was unable to beat him back.

His spirit power was actually blocked by Chu Feng.

Chu Feng’s body was enveloped with spirit power. It was his spirit power that had blocked the man’s attack.

However, even though they were both Saint-cloak World Spiritists, that man’s spirit power was Snake Mark, whereas Chu Feng’s was only Insect Mark.

“He actually managed to block the attack of a Snake Mark world spiritist with Insect Mark spirit power? Amazing. That’s simply too powerful, no?”

The crowd burst into a commotion. Countless voices of alarm could be heard.

The crowd were all world spiritists. Thus, they knew very well how great the disparity between different levels of world spiritists was.

Even though world spiritists of the same level also had disparities in strength, it was simply impossible for a world spiritist of a lower level to contend against another world spiritist of a higher level.

Yet, Chu Feng had actually managed to block an attack made with Snake Mark Spirit Power with his Insect Mark spirit power.

Chu Feng had not only broadened the crowd’s horizons, but he had also brought them extreme shock.

“Brat, you’re truly not one to be looked down on.”

It was not only the people of the younger generation. Even the Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist fighting Chu Feng revealed a look of shock in his eyes.

Soon, fierceness replaced the shock in his eyes.

“Since you’re so capable, I shall see if you’re truly able to contend against my Snake Mark spirit power.”

After saying those words, spirit power was released from that man’s palms repeatedly. His spirit power rushed forward to bombard Chu Feng’s arm that held the World Spirit Jade.

Chu Feng did not cower. He too unleashed his spirit power to contend against that man.

Like tides, the two men’s spirit power collided. Powerful surging spirit power filled the surrounding area of a thousand meters.

Chu Feng had actually managed to reach a stalemate against a Snake Mark-level world spiritist with his Insect Mark-level spirit power.

That said, no matter how powerful Chu Feng might be, he was still at a disadvantage.

In the beginning, Chu Feng was able to contend against that Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. However, as time passed, his spirit power started getting beaten back. Furthermore, his arm was also completely enveloped by that man’s spirit power.

That man had turned his spirit power into flames that began to burn Chu Feng’s arm.

However, even with that, Chu Feng still did not cower.

“Young man, to know when to retreat and avoid defeat is a good thing. That stubbornness of yours is completely meaningless.”

“It is still not too late to pull back. Otherwise, you won’t be able to keep that arm of yours.”

That man’s words were filled with mockery. More than that, he was immensely pleased with himself.

Chu Feng did not respond. However, a look of determination appeared in his eyes.

That came from Chu Feng’s stubbornness.

“Chu Feng, let me out.”

Suddenly, a voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ears. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

That voice was from the world spirit inside his body, Yu Sha.

Yu Sha had witnessed everything Chu Feng had experienced. His opponent was bullying him. Yu Sha was unable to stand by idly and watch anymore.

“Girl, this place has not only sealed martial power, but it has also sealed world spirit gates.”

“World spiritists are unable to rely on any other power here. They can only rely on their spirit power,” said Chu Feng.

“In that case, you can let go,” said Yu Sha.

“That thing is mine. I will not easily let go of it.”

“No one can easily snatch something that belongs to me from my hands.”

After saying those words to Yu Sha, Chu Feng looked to that world spiritist, his opponent.

“I’ve remembered you.”

“What?” That man felt rather confused by Chu Feng’s words.

“Clamor~~~”

However, in the next moment, Chu Feng’s arm that had been holding onto the World Spirit Jade shattered and turned to ashes that scattered onto the ground.

As for Chu Feng, he took several steps back with a look of pain on his face.

Seeing that, the man let out a light chuckle. His laughter was filled with complacence.

In the end, he was the one who had won the battle. This outcome brought great satisfaction to him.

Although he was satisfied, Chu Feng... was extremely dissatisfied.

Chu Feng took a glance at the ashes that were previously his arm and then looked back to that man. Gnashing his teeth, he said, “I’ve remembered you.”

“Sure, I’ll wait for you.”

“If you want revenge, I welcome you at any time. I only fear that your outcome next time around will be even more miserable than this time. Hahaha...”

That man laughed loudly, and then retrieved the World Spirit Jade and put it away. Then, he started walking to a spirit formation gate at the end of the plaza.

“Little brother, your defeat today is not humiliating either.”

“Right. It’s not humiliating. It’s simply that you were asking for it. Hahaha...”

The remaining ten also followed that man and left.

However, they all mocked and ridiculed Chu Feng before leaving.

Facing their ridicules, the anger on Chu Feng’s face grew more and more intense.

However, the more furious Chu Feng became, the more heartily those men laughed.

Chu Feng glared fiercely at those men. He looked on as they disappeared into the spirit formation gate one after another.

When the final individual disappeared into the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng’s expression suddenly changed completely.

The anger completely disappeared from his face, and the corners of his lips rose into a faint smile.

With a thought, the ashes on the ground immediately soared up and formed an arm that reconnected with Chu Feng’s body.

Not only was Chu Feng’s arm completely fine, but even his clothes were undamaged.

“Amazing. So Milord’s arm was actually not injured.”

“Could it be, what happened earlier was a trick, and those people have been duped?”

The people of the younger generation present all revealed looks of shock as they saw this.

Chu Feng let out a faint smile. Then, he flipped his arm, and an item appeared in his hand. It was the World Spirit Jade.

“That is...”

The crowd were all stunned upon seeing the World Spirit Jade. They were completely confused as to what had happened.

The World Spirit Jade Chu Feng held in his hand, both in terms of its aura and its appearance, was exactly the same as the one that was snatched earlier.

“Milord, what is going on here?” The crowd asked in confusion.

“Everyone, help me with one thing. If they are to return, do not tell them of my whereabouts.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words to the crowd, his body shifted, and he disappeared.

Seeing this, the crowd became even more confused. Chu Feng had disappeared without a trace. They simply don’t know where he had gone.

They were all confused by his words. Why did Chu Feng ask them not to tell those people his whereabouts should they return?

“Bastard!”

Soon, a furious shout was heard.

Turning towards the voice, the crowd discovered a figure appearing from the spirit formation gate located deep in the plaza.

That person was the person who had snatched the World Spirit Jade from Chu Feng earlier.

The crowd were still unable to see his face. That said, they were able to sense his anger from the tone of his voice.

That person looked around the plaza. He seemed to be searching for something.

“Haha. Brother Song, you’ve truly disgraced yourself. You actually allowed a person of the younger generation to dupe you.”

Soon, the other ten people also walked out of the spirit formation gate in succession.

They were laughing heartily. Their laughter was filled with mockery.

Seeing that, the bewildered crowd came to a sudden realization.

It turned out that Chu Feng had put on a disguise earlier.

That man had not managed to snatch the actual World Spirit Jade. The actual World Spirit Jade was hidden away by Chu Feng.

It turned out that Chu Feng was not actually fighting him when they were fighting earlier. Instead, he was setting up a concealment formation to deceive everyone and dupe that man.

Realizing the truth, the people of the younger generation present all felt extreme admiration for Chu Feng.

It was already extremely amazing to be able to contend against a Snake Mark as an Insect Mark.

Yet, while he was fighting against a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he was able to even set up a concealment formation to deceive that Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, leading him to suffer. That was no longer a single act of amazingness.

That was simply something that should be impossible.

Yet, such a thing had happened.
