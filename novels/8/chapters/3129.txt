Chapter 3129 - The Furious Chu Feng

However, even with the protection of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s special formation, that attack of his would still bring Chu Feng the miserable pain of having one’s soul being shattered.

“Woosh~~~”

However, at the moment when that Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast attacked him, Chu Feng’s body suddenly moved. Compared to the incoming attack filled with murderous desire, Chu Feng merely waved his arm gently.

At the same time that Chu Feng waved his arm, that Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast felt his body being shattered. Even his soul was nearly torn to shreds. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Eeeeaahhh~~~”

At that moment, that Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast let out an incomparably miserable scream.

The bystanders were able to clearly see what had happened. At the moment when that Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast rushed to attack Chu Feng, he was directly knocked back, smashing violently into a wall.

“This!!!”

At that moment, the expressions of everyone from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan changed enormously. This included that Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast that was torturing Chu Qing earlier. He also opened his mouth wide with shock.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s aura was released the moment he attacked.

Rank six Heavenly Immortal. That level of cultivation was stronger than all of them present.

“You! Who are you?!”

“Which power do you belong to?! Why did you come to our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s territory?!” The Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts asked loudly.

Even though Chu Feng had the title plate of the Chu Heavenly Clan on his waist, they did not believe that he was from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The reason for that was because the Chu Heavenly Clan was too weak..

Thus, after they felt Chu Feng’s strength, their first reaction was that Chu Feng belonged to another power, that he must’ve come with some ulterior purpose.

As for Chu Feng, he completely ignored their questions.

Chu Feng’s body shifted, and he instantly arrived beside Chu Ping. He personally helped Chu Ping back up.

Then, he asked Chu Ping, “Big brother Chu Ping, did they force you to kneel?” Chu Feng had an expression of pain as he asked those words.

“Ehh...”

Chu Ping forced a smile on his face. However, he did not answer Chu Feng’s question.

He was afraid of Chu Feng stirring up trouble. After all, their opponents were people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. If Chu Feng were to truly do anything to them, their entire Chu Heavenly Clan would end up suffering miserably.

“Chu Feng, it was done by them. We encountered them here, and they immediately attacked us.”

“Furthermore, they attacked us with fatal attacks from the very start. They were simply trying to take our lives. Fortunately, there’s a protective power in this place protecting our lives. Otherwise, we would’ve died by their hands.”

Whilst Chu Ping did not say anything, Chu Haoyan stood up and pointed at the people of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan with a furious expression as he told Chu Feng what had happened.

“Not only did they attack us, they even forced us to kneel to them. When we refused, they decided to torture us.”

“Furthermore, they were determined to shatter our souls with every attack. Even though the power of this place is capable of keeping us alive, we still had to suffer the pain of our souls being shattered,” Following him, Chu Huanyu also stood up and pointed at the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan with a shivering hand.

“Chu Feng, if you consider yourself to be a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan, you should avenge us, and have them experience the pain of having their souls shattered,” Chu Haoyan said to Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, if you are to avenge us today and get rid of our humiliation, I, Chu Huanyu, will write off my grudges and grievances with you. Furthermore, in the future, I will listen to your orders,” Chu Huanyu said to Chu Feng.

“I, Chu Haoyan, will do the same,” Chu Haoyan added.

Neither of them sounded like they were joking around. Instead, they were making a solemn vow with seriousness on their faces.

At that moment, Chu Feng turned his eyes to Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.

It was only at that moment that he discovered that those two arrogant geniuses were not only completely covered in blood and shivering with rage, but tears also covered their faces.

They were crying. They were actually crying.

Chu Feng was able to imagine what sort of humiliation Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu had suffered before he had arrived.

The egos of those two geniuses had received an enormous blow.

Otherwise, the two of them would not request help from him, someone that they hated to their bones.

“Why did you all attack my clansmen?”

Chu Feng turned his gaze to the people of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.

Chu Feng’s gaze was extremely sharp. When they sensed Chu Feng’s gaze, not to mention the others from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, even that overwhelmingly arrogant Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast that had tortured Chu Ping and Chu Qing earlier felt his nerves grow tense, and cold sweat emerge on his body.

They felt killing intent from Chu Feng’s gaze.

“You... you really are a Chu Heavenly Clansman?”

“Wha-what are you planning to do? Do you know who we are?”

“If you dare to do anything to us, we will have your Chu Heavenly Clan be unable to continue to exist in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

Even though he was already starting to panic, that Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast still pointed at Chu Feng with a shivering hand and began to threaten him.

“It would appear that you do not understand the situation you’re in,” Chu Feng narrowed his sharp brows. The killing intent in his eyes grew even stronger.

“Little brother Chu Feng, stop. You must stop immediately.”

“They are people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. We cannot afford to offend them. We cannot attack them.”

However, at that moment, Chu Ping tightly grabbed onto Chu Feng, stopping him from attacking the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.

Seeing Chu Ping acting like that, the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan were unable to help themselves from revealing a complacent expression.

“Big brother Chu Ping, what are you doing? Have you forgotten what they did to you earlier?” Chu Feng asked Chu Ping.

“Little brother Chu Feng, we have intruded upon their territory. We are the ones at fault. Even if they decided to punish us slightly, it is within their rights,” Chu Ping said.
