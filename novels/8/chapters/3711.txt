Chapter 3711 - Ten Thousand Utmost Exalted

The reason why Chu Feng had this thought was not only because of the powerful aura emitted by the halberd.

More importantly, there stood many figures around the halberd. Those were not humans. Instead, they seemed more like monstrous beasts.

They all had extremely malevolent features. If one had to describe them, they looked more like evil spirits.

These evil spirits were all enormous, measuring over a hundred meters tall. There were over ten thousand of such evil spirits.

The over ten thousand evil spirits were standing there in a uniform order. They seemed like guardians protecting the halberd.

If that were all, Chu Feng would not be so alarmed. What brought him overwhelming alarm was that those evil spirits all had their eyes closed. They seemed to be dormant. However, their auras were not concealed.

Chu Feng was able to sense that all of those evil spirits were emitting auras.

The over ten thousand evil spirits all had the same cultivation. They were all Utmost Exalted!!!

Even though they were all only rank one Utmost Exalted, their cultivations were truly exceptional in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

After all, the number of Utmost Exalted-level experts in the Ancestral Martial Starfield could be counted.

Even for the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, only the Linghu Heavenly Clan, Tantai Heavenly Clan and Jiaoli Heavenly Clan possessed Utmost Exalted-level experts.

Furthermore, Chu Feng had heard that, apart from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, only the clan chiefs of the Tantai Heavenly Clan and the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan were Utmost Exalted.

From this, one could tell what sort of status Utmost Exalted-level experts possessed in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

That was a level of cultivation that the great majority of people could not reach in their entire lifetimes.

However, should one reach that cultivation, one would become an existence that no one in the Ancestral Martial Starfield would dare to provoke.

After all, that was the Utmost Exalted realm.

That cultivation was unsurpassed in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

However, now, such existences of unsurpassed cultivation... actually stood over ten thousand strong below Chu Feng.

Seeing such a scene, Chu Feng felt fear, and utter shock.

“If I had known that the legendary Battle God’s Halberd was hidden in this spirit formation gate, I would’ve had senior Gu Mingyuan come here too.”

At the same time as he felt astonished, Chu Feng felt slightly regretful.

Although there were over ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level experts, the strength that a martial cultivator possessed was not something that numbers could make up for.

Although Gu Mingyuan was only a rank one Utmost Exalted herself, she was very powerful. Her strength could be seen by how easily she had defeated the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that if Gu Mingyuan were present, she might be able to defeat those evil spirits and obtain that legendary Battle God’s Halberd.

“Paa~~~”

Suddenly, a hand landed on Chu Feng’s shoulder.

This greatly alarmed Chu Feng. He hurriedly moved several thousand meters forward before turning around to see.

Upon turning around, Chu Feng discovered that it was not an evil spirit that stood behind him. Instead, it was a person.

This person was wearing shabby clothes. His outfit resembled that of a beggar. He was not tall. His build was very thin. He had a head of white hair tied in a messy and sloppy topknot.

On his waist was a smoke pipe and ten wine gourds.

That fellow was not only a heavy smoker, but he was also an utter drunkard.

That said, there was a sword on his back. It was a copper sword. That copper sword did not emit any aura. Chu Feng was unable to determine what sort of weapon it was.

In addition to the copper sword, there was also a compass on his back.

As a world spiritist, Chu Feng was able to tell from a single glance that it was a world spirit compass.

The world spirit compass that that person carried on his back was of extremely good quality. It was an extremely rare treasure.

Although that individual had a very sloppy and beggarly look, the world spirit compass was glimmering with light and untainted by even a speck of dust. Evidently, it was taken care of meticulously.

It could be seen that that individual cared greatly about his world spirit compass.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng was unable to see the face of the individual. The reason for that was because he was wearing a mask.

“Shhh~~~”

At the same time as Chu Feng was sizing up that individual, he too was sizing up Chu Feng.

He first made a motion for Chu Feng to keep quiet. Then, he started swimming upward, and indicated for Chu Feng to follow him.

Chu Feng was able to tell that regardless of who that person might be, he was much safer than the evil spirits below.

Besides, Chu Feng also wanted to know who that individual was, and why he would appear there. It might even be possible for him to know how to leave that place.

Thus, Chu Feng did not hesitate, and immediately followed that individual.

They only stopped after they had distanced themselves from the evil spirits below.

“Never would I have imagined that this old man has finally managed to wait for another cultivator after waiting for all these years.”

“Brat, to be able to withstand the attack from that undercurrent, you’re quite remarkable.”

That person finally spoke. His voice was somewhat hoarse. It was likely caused by smoking too much. At the same time, his voice was somewhat aged.

Chu Feng was able to tell that that person was likely an old man.

“Senior, may I know your distinguished name?” Chu Feng asked respectfully with a clasped fist.

“There’s no need for you to know this old man’s name.”

“Brat, help this old man with something, and I will give you something good.”

As that old man spoke, he took out a bead from his Cosmos Sack.

That bead was the size of a palm. It was originally transparent. However, it was soon filled with green flames.

The flames were surging like ferocious beasts, that seemed to be struggling to break out of the bead.

Upon seeing the flames, Chu Feng’s expression immediately changed. He asked, “Senior, that’s Divine Power in there?”

“Good eyesight. This is a sort of Divine Power. It’s called the Ghostflame Divine Power.”

“Boy, I see that you have the title plate of the Chu Heavenly Clan on your waist. You should possess a Heavenly Bloodline, right?”

“As long as you help this old man obtain that halberd, this old man will teach you the fusion method to make this Divine Power yours.”

“At that time, you will possess both a Heavenly Bloodline and Divine Power, two different sorts of power.” The old man said to Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt utterly shocked.

Even his voice began to shake.

The reason for that was because he suddenly recalled something his father had mentioned to him in the past.

There was a world spiritist in the Ancestral Martial Starfield capable of helping him turn the power of the Four Symbols Secret Skills into Divine Power.

At that time, Chu Feng would be able to possess both a Heavenly Bloodline and the Four Symbols Divine Power, two sorts of power!!!

“Senior, could it be that you’re the renowned world spiritist, Ox-nosed Old Daoist?”

“Mn?”

That individual was slightly startled upon hearing those words. Then, he decided to take off his mask. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to clearly see the face of the person beneath.

He had an aged face. His eyes were very small. Those eyes were the sort of eyes that would make others feel uneasy. They were eyes that belonged to unscrupulous businessmen. They were truly wily eyes.

That said, he had a very unique nose. His nose was the same as that of an ox. It was extremely ugly.

At that moment, the old man was staring at Chu Feng with his tiny eyes. At the same time, his lips rose onto a pleased smile.

“Never would I have imagined for my name to be so renowned that someone is actually able to recognize me when I’m wearing a mask.”

“That’s right. Boy, you are correct.”

“The renowned world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the world spiritist known to be the best, the person known as Ox-nosed Old Daoist, is none other than I.”
