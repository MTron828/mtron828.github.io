MGA: Chapter 1654 - Swindler Monk

Afterward, Chu Feng carefully put the scroll, the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword away.

Then, he took out a special burlap sack and placed Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi within it.

After Chu Feng did all that, he began to bring Nangong Moli back to the Nangong Imperial Clan’s territory. He was planning to bring her back to the Nangong Imperial Clan. After all, Chu Feng was currently a wanted criminal. Thus, it would not be suitable for him to bring Nangong Moli around with him. If he were to encounter a true expert, merely their oppressive might would be able to instantly bind Chu Feng. Chu Feng simply had no means of protecting Nangong Moli.

Thus, at this time, it was still the Nangong Imperial Clan that was the safest for Nangong Moli. Coincidentally, when Chu Feng was returning to the Nangong Imperial Clan, he passed through a city. In that city, he actually encountered people from the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Thus, Chu Feng had Nangong Moli go to them. When those people saw Nangong Moli, they were extremely respectful. Likely, they knew that Nangong Moli was a genius who their Nangong Imperial Clan was focused on nurturing. Thus, they did not dare to neglect her.

After finding out that Nangong Moli wanted to quickly return to the clan, they immediately stopped everything they were doing and began to escort Nangong Moli back to the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Chu Feng secretly followed them for a while. He was only relieved when he discovered that they did not have any ulterior motives toward Nangong Moli, truly wanting to escort her back to the Nangong Imperial Clan, and were treating her extremely well.

Chu Feng did not immediately distance himself from the range of the Nangong Imperial Clan’s area of activity. Instead, he returned to the city that he had passed earlier with the burlap sack that contained Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi.

Chu Feng planned to wait until nighttime, when there were not a lot of people around, in order to strip the clothes off Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi and hang them on top of the city gate as a minor retaliation against the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Chu Feng wanted to let the Nangong Imperial Clan know that although he was still very small and weak, he was not someone who they could bully as they wished. If they wanted to bully him, they would be destined to pay the price.

Chu Feng was strolling around the city and trying to find a less populated tavern to spend the night when he suddenly found an amusing person.

That person was a monk. He was extremely fat, so fat that his width was almost longer than his height. He looked to be in his seventies, and had a very corrupted appearance.

However, he was wearing very plain and ordinary cotton clothing. His clothes were filled with mends and sewings, it was simply akin to the clothing of a beggar.

Furthermore, beside that fat monk was a lousy banner. There were several characters on top of that lousy, badly damaged banner.

‘Oh Heavens, oh Earth, I am the best at fortune telling.’

‘From five thousand years from the past to three thousand years in the future,’

‘People call me know-it-all. I am a wanderer without name or surname.’

This monk was actually a fortune teller. However, it had always been Daoists who would do fortune telling. Since when did monks start telling fortunes too?

The reason why Chu Feng found this amusing was because this fat monk was currently telling the fortune of a young girl.

That young girl appeared to be only fifteen or sixteen years old. She was very fair-skinned, and possessed quite a clean face. While she could not be considered to be a great beauty, she did possess a decent appearance. However, at this moment, she had a very uncomfortable expression on her face. Without thinking about it much, Chu Feng already knew the reason why she had that expression.

That fat monk was tightly grabbing onto that young girl’s right hand with one hand. With his other hand, he was rubbing that young girl’s fair-skinned hand nonstop. How could this possibly be palmistry? This was simply taking advantage of someone.

“Mister, I’m not going to have my fortune told anymore.”

The young girl pulled her right hand back, turned around, and immediately tried to leave. Evidently, she had managed to become aware that the situation was bad.

“Little girl, could it be that you thought that this monk was taking advantage of you?” Seeing that young girl trying to leave, the fat monk spoke with a serious expression.

“Mister, that’s not it. Merely, I must go because I have something urgent that I must take care of,” That young girl was shy. She found it embarrassing to tell the truth. Thus, she hurriedly tried to provide an explanation.

“Hehe...” However, right at this moment, that fat monk suddenly opened his large mouth and revealed a mouthful of stinky yellow teeth. While laughing very vulgarly, he said, “Actually, I was taking advantage of you. Little girl, the world is a dangerous place. You must know how to be on guard against those who are shameless.”

“Mister, you...” The young woman naturally did not anticipate that this monk would actually dare to openly admit to taking advantage of her. All of a sudden, she stood there in a stunned manner and did not know what to do.

“Little girl, what’s wrong? Could it be that you’ve fallen for me? If that’s the case, you don’t have to leave. How about you spend the night with me instead?” The fat monk laughed shamelessly.

“Shameless!” The young girl’s face became extremely red. She truly regretted thinking that this monk would truly be able to tell her fortune.

Not only did she allow him to fondle her hand, she had even allowed him to fondle her hand for so long. Upon thinking about how she had been taken advantage of by this old, ugly, fat and shameless person, the young girl was filled with so much regret that she wanted to find a wall to crash into.

As she began to leave, she left the words, “Just you wait.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“My! Little girl, what do you mean by that?”

“This monk did what he did out of kindness. It was done to remind you that you must be on guard against shameless individuals. You should be grateful toward me,” The old monk was actually not afraid of her. Instead, he said those words while laughing.

The young girl ignored him and directly left. The way she left, it seemed that she was really planning to find someone to come and take care of this monk. No, to be precise, he should be a fake monk.

“With a cultivation of rank nine Martial King, he actually dares to swindle people in public. Does he really not fear that he’ll be beaten to death?” Chu Feng inspected the cultivation of this fake monk and immediately began to feel fear for him. This was the Overlord Domain. It was a place with countless Half Martial Emperor-level experts. For a person of his level of cultivation to do this sort of thing was simply courting death.

However, due to the fact that Chu Feng had things to do, he did not try to bother with someone like this monk. After enjoying the show, he was prepared to find a tavern to take shelter for the night.

Right at this moment, that monk looked to Chu Feng. “My, young man, I see that the space between your eyebrows has darkened. You will definitely be met with a great calamity. However, I have an ingenious technique that is capable of helping you resolve this calamity.”

“Since the two of us have encountered one another here, it means that we have been brought together by fate. This poor monk will not charge you a single cent and will, in fact, resolve your calamity free of charge. What do you think?”

Chu Feng looked to his surroundings and discovered that he was the only one there. It seemed like the monk was really speaking to him. Thus, he asked, “Are you talking to me?”

“It is fate that brought us together. Thus, other than talking to you, who else would I be talking to?” As the fake monk spoke those words, he arrived before Chu Feng and was looking at him with a beaming smile.

At this moment, Chu Feng started to frown. He had clearly concealed his cultivation and changed his appearance.

At this moment, his cultivation was that of a rank nine Martial King, and his appearance was that of a burly middle-aged man. However, that fake monk actually addressed him as ‘young man.’ What sort of eyesight did he possess?

“I’d suggest you go and deceive others. I fear that you will have to pay the price if you want to deceive me,” Chu Feng was disinclined to bother wasting time with a swindler.

The fake monk patted his big belly and said, “Young man, it seems that you do not trust me. You can ask me any random question. See if I can answer it. I’ll tell you this, this old man’s reputation as a know-it-all is definitely not underserved.”

“Heh, okay then. You’ve heard of the Five Elements Secret Skills, right?” Chu Feng casually asked.

“Gold Immortal Profound Technique, Wood Immortal Profound Technique, Water Immortal Profound Technique, Fire Immortal Profound Technique and the Earth Immortal Profound Technique.”

“They were created in the Ancient Era by a very powerful expert called the Five Elements Old Ancestor. As for those five great secret skills, they are not only known collectively as the Five Elements Secret Skills, they are also known to be the five strongest secret skills in the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“According to legend, if someone were capable of obtaining all five of the secret skills, they would be able to obtain a secret.”

“Unfortunately, after one obtains a secret skill, one’s body will feel a sense of oppression. There is simply no one in the entire world with a body capable of housing all five secret skills. If one tried to do it forcefully, one would only harm oneself and die from the explosion of one’s body,” The fake monk said in a very knowledgeable manner.

Speaking of it, what this fake monk had said was even more detailed than what Chu Feng had heard before. However, the extra bits said by this fake monk were simply things that Chu Feng did not believe. After all, the way Chu Feng saw it, this monk was nothing more than a swindler.
