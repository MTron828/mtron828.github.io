Chapter 4300 - Xianhai Renhu

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. As expected of the renowned young master Shaoyu.”

“You actually possess such a cultivation at such a young age.”

“Unfortunately, you will not be able to protect that kid today.”

“Not only him, you will not be able to protect yourself either,” said that man from the Demon Morph Clan.

Even though he had fallen into Xianhai Shaoyu’s hands, he was not panicking in the slightest. Instead, he was extremely pleased with himself.

Hearing those words, Xianhai Shaoyu didn’t say anything in response. But, killing intent emerged in his eyes.

After he confirmed that it was impossible to obtain any information from this person from the Demon Morph Clan, Xianhai Shaoyu decided to eliminate this person.

“Woosh---”

But, right when he was about to act, a dark-black colored blade ray flew over from afar.

Xianhai Shaoyu immediately moved back to dodge it.

That blade ray severed Xianhai Shaoyu’s martial power hand and freed that man from the Demon Morph Clan.

Xianhai Shaoyu turned his gaze afar.

Once he did so, he started frowning. A look of unease even appeared on his face.

Three were over three hundred people standing in the starry sky far away.

Those were all people from the Demon Morph Clan.

Furthermore, they were standing at the direction where the spirit formation gate formed by the black case was.

Those people had sealed off the path for Xianhai Shaoyu and Chu Feng to leave this place.

But, if that was all, Xianhai Shaoyu wouldn’t be feeling so uneasy.

Xianhai Shaoyu was not someone afraid of the Demon Morph Clan.

But, at this moment, the auras of the two people leading this group of three hundred plus Demon Morph Clansmen were unfathomable.

Not even Xianhai Shaoyu possesses any certainty in being able to defeat those two individuals.

Even though he was feeling very uneasy, Xianhai Shaoyu did not reveal it. Instead, he remained calm and composed.

“You all wanted to plunder the powers that’s currently fusing with us?”

“Demon Morph Clan, you all have truly grown bolder and bolder. Are you planning to challenge our Immortal Sea Fish Clan?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu with a stern voice.

“Young master Shaoyu, ignoring the fact that you’re in this place all on your own, even if your Immortal Sea Fish Clansnemn are here with you, I will not fear either.”

“There are no powers in the entire martial cultivation world that our Demon Morph Clan does not dare offend.”

As the red-haired leader spoke, he unleashed his boundless oppressive might. He was planning to attack Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Damn it...”

Xianhai Shaoyu frowned even deeper upon seeing this situation.

The moment that red-haired Demon Morph Clansman unleashed his oppressive might, Xianhai Shaoyu knew that he would not be that man’s match.

“Stop!”

But, right at this moment, the white-haired leader extended his hand and stopped the red-haired leader.

“What’s this? Are you feeling reluctant?”

The red-haired leader refused to accept that white-haired leader’s decision.

Not only did he not retrieve his oppressive might, he was even looking at the white-haired leader with anger in his eyes.

“Boom---”

Suddenly, the white-haired leader’s body started to distort. Then, oppressive might rushed out from his body.

Once his oppressive might appeared, he became the focus of this starry sky.

Even the red-haired leader’s oppressive might was suppressed by him.

At this moment, the people from the Demon Morph Clan, including that red-haired leader, had a change in their expression.

Evidently, none of them anticipated for the white-haired leader to be this powerful.

The red-haired leader was no match against this white-haired leader.

“Must you force me to attack you?”

The white-haired leader looked to the red-haired leader. His gaze turned hostile.

Seeing this, the red-haired leader removed his oppressive might. He said, “Do not forget, you’re already one of the Demon Morph Clan.”

“Rest assured, I know where I’m standing.”

“But, I am qualified to make my own decision.”

“All of you can step down,” said the white-haired leader.

“What is the meaning of that? Are you trying to let them get away?” asked the red-haired leader.

“Do not force me to attack you,” As the white-haired leader spoke, his oppressive might grew even stronger.

The people from the Demon Morph Clan, including the red-haired leader, were all oppressed by that oppressive might.

“You...”

“Very well, I will make sure to report this matter to Lord Clan Chief.”

Although the red-haired leader was feeling very displeased, he was unable to do anything as the white-haired leader was simply too powerful for him to handle. After leaving those threatening words, he turned around and left.

Seeing that, the others from the Demon Morph Clan also followed after him.

In a blink of an eye, apart from Xianhai Shaoyu and Chu Feng, only the Demon Morph Clan’s white-haired leader remained in this starry sky.

“What kind of performance is this?”

Alert filled Xianhai Shaoyu’s eyes.

He doesn’t understand why that white-haired leader did that.

But, he knew how dangerous the Demon Morph Clan was.

“Shaoyu, are you unable to distinguish my voice?”

As the white-haired leader spoke, he did something shocking.

The white-haired leader actually removed the mask from his face and pulled down his hood to reveal his true appearance.

While he had a head of white hair, his appearance was that of a middle-aged man. While there were some scars on his face, one could still tell that he was extremely handsome in his youth.

Seeing this person, Xianhai Shaoyu’s expression turned extremely complicated. It was one of shock and joy. Soon, he blurted out, “Fourth uncle!”

This person was named Xianhai Renhu.

He was Xianhai Shaoyu’s blood uncle, a blood brother to his father.

“Shaoyu, it’s been a long time. Your cultivation has increased again,” said Xianhai Renhu with a smile.

His smile was very good-natured. It was a smile that only one’s close relative would have.

But, facing Xianhai Renhu’s good-natured smile, Xianhao Shaoyu was unable to become happy,”

“Fourth uncle, have you really joined the Demon Morph Clan?”

“Why are you doing this?”

Confusion filled Xianhai Shaoyu’s voice. At the same time, he was filled with grief and dismay.

Xianhai Shaoyu has been looked after with concern and care by the entire Immortal Sea Fish Clan all his life.

This Xianhai Renhu was no exception.

The relationship Xianhai Shaoyu had with Xianhai Renhu was also extremely good. It even surpassed that of other close relatives.

But, Xianhai Renhu left the Immortal Sea Fish Clan when Xianhai Shaoyu was a youth.

It has been many years since they’ve last seen one another.

There has been rumors in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan that Xianhai Renhu had joined the Demon Morph Clan.

But, Xianhai Shaoyu had refused to believe those rumors to be true. He was unwilling to believe that Xianhai Renhu had betrayed their Immortal Sea Fish Clan.

“Shaoyu, everyone have their path.”

“There are some things that I cannot inform you right now. But, you will one day understand your fourth uncle’s difficulties.”

“Right now, you should leave with your friend.”

Xianhai Renhu moved aside and opened the path to the spirit formation gate.

“If you are to let me go, the Demon Morph Clan will definitely not let you off easily.”

“Fourth uncle, you should return home with me,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

But, Xianhai Renhu smiled and shook his head, “I cannot return. As for my safety, you don’t have to worry about it.”

“It is you, on the other hand, that needs to return to the clan.”

“Do not go out on your own without any protection.”

“The martial cultivation world is not peaceful right now.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After hearing those words from Xianhai Renhu, Xianhai Shaoyu’s eyes were surging with emotions.

Even though it has been many years since they’ve last seen one another, this fourth uncle of his was still filled with concern and care for him.

“Fourth uncle, can you tell me why the Demon Morph Clan is here?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.
