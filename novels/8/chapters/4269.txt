Chapter 4269 - Becoming A Disciple In Public

“Who’s that?”

“Where did this ugly person come from?”

Seeing the shifty-eyed ox-nose looking wretched old man, the crowd all turned their back in disgust. Many even grew furious.

There were countless people among the crowd that wanted to take Chu Feng as their disciple.

But, apart from the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted, Grandmaster Luo Tuo and Celestial Fairy Muzhi, practically no one dared to speak so loudly and openly about intending to become Chu Feng’s master.

The majority of them were sending voice transmissions to Chu Feng or speaking very quietly. After all, they all knew of their own worth.

On one hand, they do not dare to openly voice their desire to take Chu Feng as their disciple. On the other hand, they were lacking confidence and felt that they were unqualified to be the master of such an outstanding person of the younger generation.

But, at this time, this incomparably ugly nobody that came out from who knows where actually dared to so brazenly and openly declare Chu Feng to be his disciple.

It would only be natural for the crowd to feel displeased.

“Where did a reckless trash like you came from? Scram away from this old man’s line of sight right now. Else, I’ll have your life.”

Already displeased, Grandmaster Luo Tuo fiercely threatened the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Many other people present were also sneering at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

They all felt that Ox-nosed Old Daoist was a lunatic, a reckless lunatic with a deathwish by choosing to act up at a time and place like this.

“You all...”

Seeing that the crowd were actually opening ridiculing Ox-nosed Old Daoist, anger immediately appeared on Grandmaster Tang Chen’s face. He was about to lash out at them.

While the others didn’t know who the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was, he knew very well.

If it must be said, practically no one present was qualified to ridicule Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

After all, Ox-nosed Old Daoist used to be the publicly accepted strongest world spiritist of the Holy Light Galaxy.

But, before Grandmaster Tang Chen could say anything, a voice transmission reached his ears.

“Brother Tang Chen, do not interfere. Let me handle everything.”

That voice came from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Grandmaster Tang Chen looked to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and saw that he was smiling and was winking at him with that wrinkle-filled eye.

His appearance was truly improper. Yet, it just so happened... that was precisely the style at which the Ox-nosed Old Daoist does things.

“Is that old codger finally going to start?”

Seeing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist acting like this, Grandmaster Tang Chen was simply unable to conceal his happiness.

All these years of silent forbearance, having to train again from the start, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had suffered from pains unimaginable for ordinary people.

But, Tang Chen knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist... was finally going to return.

“Everyone, you all can shut up now.”

“I’ve already made it clear that Chu Feng is my disciple. For you all to shout at my disciple and tell him to become your disciple, you’re simply disregarding my existence too much, no?”

“Although I have a good temper, my tolerance is still not infinite. It’s best that you all do not piss me off.”

Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke again.

This time around, his words incurred an intense reaction of dissatisfaction from the crowd.

“This old fart had truly gone mad. Someone like him actually dared to proclaim himself to be Chu Feng’s master?”

“Ugly trash, quickly scam back to where you came from.”

The bystanders were still acting alright. They were only cruising out Ox-nosed Old Daoist and trying to drive him away.

But, Grandmaster Luo Tuo was not reacting that simply.

Killing intent had appeared in Grandmaster Luo Tuo’s sharp and aged eyes.

“Old beggar, you’re truly a shameless one.”

“Are you really trying to die here?”

Grandmaster Luo Tuo felt that someone like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was simply unqualified to fight over Chu Feng with him. If the Ox-nosed Old Daoist does not scram right now, he will really end up attacking to kill him.

However, right at this moment, a voice sounded from the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain. When that voice was heard, the crowd were all astonished.

“To dare act this disrespectful toward my master, have you all grown tired of living?”

If it was someone else that said those words, the crowd would not be that astonished.

But, it just so happened that the person who said those words was none other than Chu Feng.

Indeed, it was Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had not wanted to recognize the Ox-nosed Old Daoist as his master.

It was not because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not qualified to be his master.

Instead, it was because he vowed in the past to no longer take anyone as his master.

The reason for that decision was because of the accumulated experience he had in his journey.

Those close to him will always be implicated by him.

Chu Feng does not wish to implicate anyone else. That was why he decided to no longer take anyone as his master.

But, Chu Feng later discovered that even if he doesn’t take others as his master, those with close connection with him, people that he concerned for, will still be implicated by him.

Because of that, the reason why Chu Feng still refused the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was so as to not let down all the other people he refused in the past.

After all, he had simply refused too many people.

If he agreed to become the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple, it would be truly unfair to those people.

But, with the way things appeared today, he would really not be able to obtain the inheritance should he refuse to recognize someone as his master.

Chu Feng does not wish to abandon this inheritance.

At a time when he must recognize someone as his master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was undoubtedly the optimal candidate.

Ignoring the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s strength and reputation, merely the fact that he had helped him fuse with the Four Symbols Divine Body was a favor enough to make Chu Feng take him as his master.

Chu Feng’s words caused a massive commotion to the surroundings.

“Young hero Chu Feng, what are you talking about?”

“You’re saying that this ox-nosed fellow is your master?”

“I... am I mishearing things?”

The crowd found it difficult to accept Chu Feng’s decision.

In enormous shock, the crowd even began to think that they misheard Chu Feng and started asking him for confirmation.

“I’d urge everyone to watch your words. Being disrespectful toward my master is equivalent to being disrespectful toward me, Chu Feng,” said Chu Feng with a stern voice.

His serious attitude does not seem like someone making a joke.

“Heavens! He’s Chu Feng’s master?!”

“But, why would Chu Feng’s master be someone like that?”

“Who is that? How come I’ve never met him before?”

“Judging from his aura, he’s extremely weak. He seemed to only be an early-level Utmost Exalted.”

“How could such a weak and nameless person become young friend Chu Feng’s master?”

“What sort of dog shit luck did he encounter?”

Although they found things to be very difficult to accept, the crowd had no choice but to believe it to be true after hearing it from Chu Feng’s own mouth.

But, learning this matter caused the crowd to feel extremely pained and depressed.

The fact that Chu Feng possessed a master meant that their chance to obtain the inheritance had completely disappeared.

It would be one thing if Chu Feng’s master was someone stronger than them.

But, Chu Feng’s master was actually such a weak and nameless individual. They were all unable to accept it.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you said earlier that you do not have a master.”

“Why are you saying that you have a master now?” asked Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted with a stern voice.

“It’s true. I didn’t have a master earlier. But I do now.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After saying those words, Chu Feng actually kneeled onto the ground. Then, he clasped his fist toward Ox-nosed Old Daoist. With a loud voice, he said, “Senior had shown enormous grace to this Chu Feng.”

“This Chu Feng is unable to return senior’s favor. If senior is willing to accept me, this Chu Feng wishes to become senior’s disciple.”

“From today on, master’s benefactors shall become this Chu Feng’s benefactors.”

“Master’s enemies shall become this Chu Feng’s enemies.”

“While the future of the martial cultivation path is filled with unknowns, this Chu Feng is willing to advance and retreat together with master.”

Chu Feng’s voice resonated all around. But, what shocked the crowd the most was his action.

Chu Feng was actually really choosing to become someone’s disciple on the spot.

But, there were clearly this many people present stronger than that ox-nosed fellow. Why would Chu Feng insist on choosing such a weak individual to be his master?

The crowd were simply unable to comprehend it.

After seeing Chu Feng’s public display of his intention to become Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple, Grandmaster Tang Chen suddenly realized something.

When the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said Chu Feng was his disciple, that was his own one-sided thinking.

But now, that became the truth.

Regardless of why Chu Feng refused in the past, he was willing to recognize him as his master now.

‘Ox-nose, you old codger. To be able to take a disciple like Chu Feng, it’s truly the sign of sweet beginnings after bitter hardships,’ sighed Grandmaster Tang Chen in his heart.

From the smile that covered his face, one could tell that he was feeling joyous for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist from the bottom of his heart.

He knew what happened to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist the best. As such, he knew how difficult things had been for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

To be able to encounter a disciple like Chu Feng, Grandmaster Tang Chen felt that it could be considered to be a sort of compensation for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

This compensation was sufficient enough to offset all the pain and sufferings the Ox-nosed Old Daoist received.

That being said, the person feeling the most joyous of all would be none other than the Ox-nosed Old Daoist himself.

Not only were all his wrinkles present all across his face, he was smiling so hard that his teeth were completely exposed.

He was truly overjoyed.

“Good. Good. Good. You and I, master and disciple, shall advance and retreat together. Hehe...”

Ox-nosed Old Daoist nodded his head repeatedly. As he spoke, saliva was flowing out of his mouth.

He simply looked like Zhu Bajie after he managed to take a beautiful wife. That joy was simply unimaginable.

[1. Zhu Bajie is the pig in Journey To The West that Dragon Ball was loosely based on. Oolong, the pig in DB, was supposed to be him.]

“Look at how overjoyed and pleased with himself he looks. It’s simply like a toad that managed to eat the flesh of a swan.”

“Motherfucker! What dog shit luck is this?!”

The crowd were so furious their eyes turned green. All kinds of mockery and insults resounded nonstop.

Although the description they were using does not befit that of a relationship of master and disciple, it was extremely fitting when placed on the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

[1. Toad that managed to eat the flesh of a swan → an ugly guy that managed to take a beauty for wife/girlfriend]

For such a nameless fellow to be able to encounter a genius like Chu Feng, what difference was it from a toad eating the flesh of a swan?

“Woosh---”

Suddenly, a flash of light streaked across the sky and straight toward the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The next moment, a muffled bang was heard.

The light passed through the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and exploded him on the spot.

It was the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted!!!

“Young friend Chu Feng, it would seem that you’ll have to find a new master,” The Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted said to Chu Feng after killing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a single attack.
