Chapter 3777 - Cursed

“Mi... Milord, thank you.”

“Truly, thank you.”

Old Freak Tang was able to tell that Chu Feng was treating his illness. Thus, he immediately started thanking him.

“Senior, please don’t mention it. This is what this junior should do.”

“After all, you’re Grandmaster Liangqiu’s friend.”

“Besides, this junior came here because I had something that I need senior’s help with,” said Chu Feng.

“Milord, this lowly one truly does not know any Grandmaster Liangqiu. You truly must’ve mistaken me for someone else." Old Freak Tang was still trying to conceal the matter.

“Senior, you don’t have to try concealing this matter from junior anymore. I already know that you’re the person I’m searching for.”

“Although I do not know why senior is hiding his identity, this junior truly has no choice but to trouble senior.”

“This junior has a friend who is currently cursed, and might be in fatal danger.”

“This junior has heard from Grandmaster Liangqiu that senior is proficient in curses, and the ability to remove them. That is why this junior came to seek senior’s guidance," said Chu Feng.

“You’ve truly mistaken me for someone else," said Old Freak Tang.

“Senior, this junior knows that this will be very difficult for you. However, this matter concerns a life. This junior does not wish to offend senior; as long as senior is willing to help me, I am willing to accept any condition,” said Chu Feng.

Suddenly, Old Freak Tang shouted, “Leave!”

At that moment, Chu Feng grew tense.

The reason for that was because Old Freak Tang was no longer speaking with a lowly and terrified tone. Instead, he spoke with great impatience. Most importantly, he had released his oppressive might.

Rank one Utmost Exalted. Sure enough, it was as Chu Feng had expected, he was a rank one Utmost Exalted.

After Old Freak Tang unleashed his oppressive might, Chu Feng realized that he was truly angered. If Chu Feng continued to nag him, he might not simply shout at him again.

“Leave immediately. Do not appear before me again,” said Old Freak Tang. He took a glance at Chu Feng as he said those words. In that glance, his eyes were brimming with threat.

Old Freak Tang knew that he could not hide from Chu Feng anymore, so decided to threaten him.

Chu Feng felt that Old Freak Tang was not simply trying to scare him. Instead, if he were to continue to tangle with Old Freak Tang, he would really end up attacking him.

Thus, Chu Feng could only leave for the time being.

“Please excuse my disturbance.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he left the smithy and Autumnfall Village.

However, he stopped upon leaving Autumnfall Village. Chu Feng still wouldn’t give up.

As that moment, Chu Feng changed his appearance back that of Asura and sat on the branch of a giant tree. He looked to the flowing river below and started to ponder.

“It would appear that I can only find a way through this situation through his daughter.”

Chu Feng felt that Old Freak Tang and Song Ge’s mother would both die soon.

Thus, their only worry would be Song Ge.

As such, Song Ge would be the way for Chu Feng to breach the impasse.

“Wuu~~~”

Suddenly, a stinging pain came from Chu Feng’s chest.

Chu Feng lowered his head, and discovered that a cobweb-like black scar had appeared on his chest.

That stinging pain came from the black scar.

“This is... a curse?”

Chu Feng narrowed his brows. He was able to tell that the black scar on his chest was not a simple poison. The aura it emitted was similar to Bai Liluo’s aura when her curse had flared up.

Although the aura emitted by the scar was much weaker compared to Bai Liluo’s curse, Chu Feng still determined that it was very likely a curse.

“When was I cursed? Earlier?”

It shouldn’t be possible for Chu Feng to be cursed without any cause. He felt that it must have been done by that Old Freak Tang.

Thinking back on it, when Chu Feng was treating Old Freak Tang’s injury, his hand had indeed touched his chest.

At that time, Chu Feng did not pay much attention to it, and also did not notice anything strange. Never would he have suspected that he’d actually been cursed by Old Freak Tang at that time.

“Why did he curse me? Is it to serve as a warning?”

As Chu Feng pondered, the curse began to spread throughout his body. Even though he was trying his hardest to resist the spreading of the curse with his world spirit techniques, he was unable to stop it at all.

This sort of stinging pain was completely tolerable for Chu Feng.

What worried him was that whilst the stinging pain was tolerable, his consciousness was starting to become fuzzy. Even his body was becoming numb. In a daze, Chu Feng felt his body fall from the tree and into the river below, and he began to drift with the flow of the river.

At the same time, Chu Feng felt that someone was speaking nonstop by his ears. Chu Feng was clearly unable to tell what that person was saying, but his mouth started to uncontrollable converse with that person.

Strangest of all, Chu Feng was unable to hear and unable to tell what he was saying.

Everything appeared so very strange.

This continued for a long time before the voice finally dissipated. However, Chu Feng was still unconscious.

Later on, Chu Feng felt that someone had dragged him out from the river.

After many hours had passed, Chu Feng finally regained consciousness.

After he regained consciousness, Chu Feng discovered that he was lying in a bed.

The room he was in was very gorgeous and spacious. He felt that he must be inside a palace.

Chu Feng knew that this should be the residence of the person who had fished him out of the river.

At that moment, Chu Feng looked at his chest, and discovered that the scar had disappeared.

No matter how he examined his chest, he was unable to find any trace of it. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Did that curse disappear or... is Old Freak Tang’s ability truly so powerful that I am unable to detect it unless it flares up?”

“I should go and apologize to him. No, forget it, I should go find his daughter first.”

Chu Feng felt that the curse was not too much of a hindrance to him. He felt that Old Freak Tang was most likely giving him a warning. Thus, he felt that it would be better for him to not seek him out.

After all, he had said everything he needed to say. Even if he sought out Old Freak Tang again, he would not be able to persuade him. Instead, he might end up angering him. Thus, Chu Feng felt that it would be better to seek out his daughter first.

After making his decision, Chu Feng got up and began walking towards the exit.

After walking out of the palace, Chu Feng discovered that he was in a village.

Although the buildings in the village were not straw huts, they were still very simple and plain.

Because of that, the sumptuous palace he had just walked out of appeared rather incompatible with the village.

Although the martial cultivators and world spiritists in the village appeared extremely weak by an Upper Realm’s standards, they would all be considered to be top experts in the Lower Realms.

With their strength, they were all capable of constructing luxurious palaces.

Yet, they had not done so. There was naturally a reason why they didn’t.

The reason was that they were not allowed to.

Martial cultivators were separated into different tiers. The different tiers of martial cultivators all lived different sorts of lives.

Villagers like them, based on their cultivation, would be the weakest existence in that Upper Realm.

Because of that, they; based on the secular way of looking at things, felt that they should live plainly, and even be impoverished.

If they insisted on living a life that surpassed their means, they would not only court displeasure from others, but they might even be erased by those more powerful than them.

It could be said that the people of the martial cultivation world were forcibly separated into different tiers.

Even if they possessed the ability to live better lives, they were not permitted to do so in the world that they lived in. That just so happened to be the truth that those villagers had silently accepted.

Thinking about it, it was lamentable.

In the past, he had even wondered if those people would still be willing to stay in the Upper Realms if they had known that they would be considered to be very powerful and could live a cut above others in the Lower Realms.

However, in the end, the conclusion Chu Feng came to was that whilst a small portion of them might be willing to leave for the Lower Realms, the great majority would still choose to stay in the Upper Realms.

The reason for that was all because they belonged to an Upper Realm. Being in an Upper Realm was in itself a different status.

Martial cultivators cared greatly about this sort of thing.

Thus, to them, not to mention the Lower Realms, they would not even be willing to leave for Ordinary Realms.

In their eyes, Lower Realms and Ordinary Realms were simply not places for martial cultivators to live. They were places where trash resided.

Even though they lived the most inferior lives in the Upper Realms and received supercilious looks from countless others, they still felt superior when they encountered people from an Ordinary Realm or Lower Realm.

Perhaps this was human nature -- the vanity of the heart.
