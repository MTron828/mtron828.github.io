Chapter 5250: The Eight Successors

Chu Feng didn’t argue against the woman’s skepticism. Instead, he constructed a formation using Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy.

“You… actually grasped the legacy!”

The woman stared at Chu Feng with dazed eyes. However, she quickly snapped out of it, and a bright smile formed on her lips. She began laughing louder and louder.

“I haven’t waited in vain. Two hours! You actually grasped it within two hours! Hahaha! I told them that I would find the most impressive successor of all, and I was right! You can be sure that I’m going to brag about this to them!” the woman said laughing heartily.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng quietly watched her from the side.

All of a sudden, the woman grabbed Chu Feng’s shoulder and said, “Chu Feng, you have done well. I am satisfied with your performance.”

“Elder, is there any additional reward then?” Chu Feng asked with a gleeful smile.

“You have grasped Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy, but you still aren’t satisfied with it? How greedy can you get? Do you want me to serve you too?” the woman asked.

“Ah… I’ll pass on that. While Elder Violet is as beautiful as a fairy, I do think of myself as an upright gentleman,” Chu Feng replied.

He felt comfortable bantering with her, knowing that she wasn’t the type to get offended easily. Truth be told, he didn’t like to be bound by social etiquette. It was not to say that he would disrespect others for no reason, but he simply preferred to interact with others casually.

“You’re an interesting lad. I like you. It’s just that Lord Qin Jiu has instructed me not to interact too much with the successors. Otherwise, I would have loved to travel around with you. I’d be quite free after this anyway,” the woman said.

“Elder, you’re free to move around as you please?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course! I’m a living being, not a block of wood. It goes without saying that I can move around freely!” the woman replied.

“Eggy, you’re right! Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy can really move around.”

Chu Feng still remembered how Eggy had consoled him when he was frustrated from being unable to find the legacy Lord Zhenlong told him about. She had said that the legacy might have grown legs and run away. He took it as a joke back then, but who could have thought that her words would have come true?

“Heh. Do you see my prowess now?” Eggy replied gleefully.

“Yes yes, you’re incredible.” Chu Feng lavished her with compliments.

It was just then that the woman continued speaking.

“However, Lord Qin Jiu has also ordered for us to remain in one location for a sufficiently long duration before we’re finally allowed to leave. As a result, I have been here since the Ancient Era till now,” the woman said.

“You’ve been here all this while, elder?” Chu Feng was surprised to hear that.

He thought that the woman was the legacy that Lord Zhenlong had encountered, just that she had moved here. However, it would appear that his conjecture was off the mark.

“Of course. I haven’t taken a single step from here. I have just finished serving my term and was just about to leave when I met you. I really must concede that Lord Qin Jiu’s prophecies are never off the mark. Otherwise, how could there be such a huge coincidence?” the woman said.

“Are you saying that Lord Qin Jiu predicted that I would come here and succeed his legacy?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course! Why else do you think I was told to wait here? To tell you the truth, I intentionally chose a place where I had to wait the longest just so that I can meet a formidable successor. It’s just that everyone who came by here has been disappointing thus far, so I started to regret my decision. But from the looks of it now, I can confidently say that I have made the right choice!” the woman said.

“In other words, you aren’t the other legacy formation around?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. There are nine legacy formations in total. Seven of them were claimed before you appeared, and three of them were taken by the juniors of the current generation.”

As she said those words, the woman suddenly began assessing Chu Feng with a profound gaze.

“Did they receive the complete legacy too?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course,” the woman replied.

Chu Feng’s heart shook. He didn’t think that three juniors of the present generation would have obtained Lord Qin Jiu’s complete legacy too.

“Elder, can you reveal who the other seven successors are?” Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.

“I can’t divulge that,” the woman replied.

“All right.”

It was likely that Lord Qin Jiu had ordered her not to divulge the identity of the successors to others, so he wouldn’t get an answer from her no matter how he pleaded with her.

“You don’t have to be too bothered about that. There are nine legacies in total, but it doesn’t mean that they are all equal. My legacy is the hardest one to grasp, which means that the legacy you have obtained is superior to theirs,” the woman said.

Chu Feng was delighted to hear that. Who wouldn’t want to receive the best legacy of all? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“It’s all thanks to elder’s teachings,” Chu Feng said.

“You don’t need to bootlick me. You did it all on your own. I must say that I was quite surprised. However, you shouldn’t let it get over your head. The other seven successors are still alive in this world, and it’s likely that they’ll become your rivals.

“This is especially so for the lady amongst the three juniors. She’s an extremely talented world spiritist who possesses a rare world spiritist bloodline that doesn’t pale in comparison to the Ruler’s Bloodline,” the woman said.

“A world spiritist bloodline that doesn’t pale in comparison to the Ruler’s Bloodline? What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I would be divulging her identity if I told you that,” the woman replied.

“I am quite slow-witted on such stuff. I doubt that I would be able to connect the dots,” Chu Feng said.

“Don’t bother trying to sniff any information from me. I can give you a heads up on other matters but not this. The identities of the successors have to be kept confidential,” the woman said.

“I understand. I shan’t probe any further,” Chu Feng replied.

“Chu Feng, you possess incredible talents. As long as you continue working hard, you’ll surely grow swiftly. Even if you don’t have any other fortuitous encounters in the future, you should be able to deal with the other successors without a hitch. It’s just that woman that you have to be wary of. Even I can’t tell which of you will be stronger. Now that I think about it, I really do look forward to that day the two of you meet,” the woman said.

“Are we really going to be rivals?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes. Didn’t I tell you that Lord Qin Jiu has left nine legacy formations in total? There can only be one successor for each of the legacy formations, and there are already eight successors to date including you. Take me for example, I won’t be passing down the legacy to anyone else now that you have already acquired it. This was the rule set by Lord Qin Jiu.

“The ninth legacy formation is a little different. Outsiders can obtain the legacy too, but only the eight successors have the qualification to compete for the full legacy,” the woman said.

“In other words, only the successors of the other eight legacy formations have the right to obtain the complete ninth legacy?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. The ninth legacy is far superior to that of the other eight. It’s the final legacy of Lord Qin Jiu. If you wish to become the strongest world spiritist in the world, you’ll have to acquire the ninth legacy,” the woman said.

“Elder, where is the ninth legacy?” Chu Feng asked.

“How can I possibly tell you that? It’s far away from here, and you won’t be able to reach it with your current strength anyway. However, I still hope that you’ll be able to obtain the ninth legacy since you can be somewhat considered my successor,” the woman said.

“What do you mean by ‘somewhat’? I am your successor. If not for you, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy. Lord Violet, are you really not going to offer me any help?” Chu Feng asked.

“Begging me won’t work either. I won’t go against the rules set by Lord Qin Jiu,” the woman said.

“I know. I was just joking,” Chu Feng replied with an awkward smile.

The two of them knew that he wasn’t just joking around. He was really probing for information.

“Chu Feng, how strong do you think you are compared to the juniors in the world of cultivation?” the woman suddenly asked.

“I wouldn’t say that I’m weak, but I’m not amongst the top either. I have to continue working hard,” Chu Feng said.

“Looks like you have some self-awareness. Do you know who are the strongest juniors in the current generation then?” the woman asked.

“That… I’m afraid that I really don’t know,” Chu Feng said. “Elder, do you know?”

“I can only tell you that you aren’t amongst the top for the juniors of the eight galaxies, but there isn’t a huge gap. However, you’ll still be terribly lacking compared to the top juniors of the Ninth Galaxy,” the woman said.

“Elder, are you referring to the Immemorial Domain of Gods?” Chu Feng asked.

The woman smiled but didn’t answer her question.

Without a doubt, she was referring to the mysterious Immemorial Domain of Gods.

“Are there Lord Qin Jiu’s successors in the Immemorial Domain of Gods too?” Chu Feng asked.

“Mmhm,” the woman replied with a nod, affirming Chu Feng’s guess.

“In other words, the ninth legacy formation is in the Immemorial Domain of Gods?” Chu Feng asked.

“I didn’t say a word. You’re just making a wild guess.”

The woman was implicitly affirming Chu Feng’s question.

“Could it be that the juniors who have obtained the other legacies are all from the Immemorial Domain of Gods?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s not it. One of them is from the Seven Realms Galaxy,” the woman replied.

“The Seven Realms Galaxy?”

Chu Feng widened his eyes.

There was only one place he could think of when speaking of the Seven Realms Galaxy—the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It was likely that the junior was from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, which made the other party an enemy.

“You don’t need to be too nervous. In terms of sheer talent as a world spiritist, that junior is indeed outstanding compared to the other juniors of the eight galaxies. But when compared to you…”

The woman’s smile suddenly warped in disdain.

“…he’s nothing but trash.”
