Chapter 5877: Reminiscing With Zi Ling

The guidance from the Heavenly Master’s Horsetail Whisk pointed in the same direction as Chu Feng had decided on.

“Let’s go, Zi Ling,” Chu Feng said before dragging Zi Ling with him.

This realm was so huge that Chu Feng and Zi Ling, despite the incredible speed they could move at with their current cultivation level, could sense that their destination was far away. Rather than Half-God level cultivators, they felt more like normal cultivators leisurely enjoying the beautiful scenery.

The place they had arrived was barren, but that was not the case for the other parts of the realm. The area ahead of them was a plain, followed by a mountain range and a vast ocean. The ocean beneath them had towering waves with a height of over a thousand meters, and it was filled with danger.

Ferocious beasts could be seen hunting each other here and there, but Chu Feng and Zi Ling didn’t interfere at all. The speed of their travel didn’t slow for anything. They looked like experts beyond the secular world, admiring nature as it was.

Chu Feng had seen many such scenes before, but it felt different because he was traveling with Zi Ling this time around. It filled his heart with warmth, and it reminded him of their time at the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

Back then, Chu Feng was still a disciple of the Azure Dragon School, and he had just ended his one-year agreement with Gong Luyun and concluded his enmity with Lingyun School and Qilin Prince Mansion.

To raise his cultivation, he made his way to the Qin Province’s Prestigious Villa and unwittingly joined a Marriage Gathering they held. It was then that he met Zi Ling a second time, and the events that transpired furthered their relationship.

The Marriage Gathering was just a pretext for the powers to gather and attack the Ten Thousand Monstrous Mountain to claim their treasure.

Chu Feng obtained the Asura Ghost Axe, which made many powers view him as a thorn in the eyes. They joined forces and declared him wanted. Just like that, he was put in a position where he could lose his life at any moment.

Yet, Zi Ling chose to travel with him.

Those powers were no more than a speck of dust to the current Chu Feng—he could obliterate them with a stomp of his leg—but he was just a small disciple from the Azure Province back then. Faced with the top powers from the other provinces, there was a great deal of stress resting on him even though he didn’t fear them.

He was living life on the edge. A slight misstep could spell death.

This time, he had offended the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, the strongest power in the vast world of cultivation on the surface. Yet again, Zi Ling was with him. This left him deep in thought. With such a lover by his side, what more could he want from life?

“What’s wrong? Is there something on my face?” Zi Ling turned to Chu Feng in confusion.

She realized that Chu Feng had been focused on the road earlier, but at some point, he stopped looking at his surroundings and instead looked at her.

“Yes, there’s something there,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ah?” Zi Ling widened her eyes. She had only made that remark jestingly; she would have known if there was something on her face.

“The greatest beauty in the world is resting on your face. How can there be someone as gorgeous as my Zi Ling?” Chu Feng remarked.

“Ah... Big brother Chu Feng, that was a cringy remark.” Zi Ling pouted.

“Hahaha! It was a little cringy, but I’d only show this side to you, “Chu Feng replied with a cheeky laugh.

“Really?” Zi Ling eyed him in suspicion.

“Of course!” Chu Feng earnestly nodded.

“I don’t believe you,” Zi Ling replied.

“I mean it.” Chu Feng insisted.

“What about Su Mei and Su Rou?”

“Well...” That put Chu Feng in an awkward position.

“Do you still not have any news on them?”

“Not at the moment. I don’t know where the Moon Immortal went.” Chu Feng became grim at the mention of Su Rou and Su Mei. He didn’t think the Moon Immortal would bring harm to the two of them, but he was worried that something might happen to the Moon Immortal.

After all, the vast world of cultivation was fraught with danger.

“Big brother Chu Feng, they’ll be fine. I’ll look for them together with you,” Zi Ling said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded.

Beyond the ocean was a forest filled with towering trees that could reach up to a thousand meters tall, but gigantic apes roaming in the forest made these trees look as like mere grass and shrubs.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

The earth shook rhythmically, Each time it shook, a huge flock of birds would rise from the forest and circle the top.

The apes were frantically fleeing. There was a cloud of smoke behind them, and huge bunches of trees were swiftly falling behind them.

It was ants.

They were no more than a meter long, but there were so many of them that they formed a flood. The apes were massive, but they were at the same cultivation level as the ants—Exalted level. Given the difference in the numbers, the ants quickly caught up with the apes and devoured them clean in a matter of seconds.

There weren’t even any bones left. The only remaining proof of the ape’s existence was the blood patches left around.

As for the ants, they delved back into the ground after successfully devouring their prey.

“There are already Exalted level beasts here. There’ll be stronger enemies if we continue venturing further. Big brother Chu Feng, do you think there’ll be existences here whom we can’t deal with?” Zi Ling asked.

They would find some treasures along the way, and the treasures grew better the further they advanced, though the beasts they encountered became correspondingly stronger too.

“That’s possible,” Chu Feng replied.

Just then, a faint light appeared. The trees that had collapsed from being devoured by the ants recovered as if nothing had happened.

“It’s not just a possibility anymore,” Chu Feng remarked.

Zi Ling looked uneasy. “Do you think the creator of this realm is still alive?”

She was a world spiritist too, so she could tell that this was a formation realm. Such a powerful formation realm could only be created by a correspondingly strong world spiritist.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling wouldn’t stand a chance if that world spiritist was still around.
