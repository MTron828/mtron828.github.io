Chapter 3581 - Sacred Cultivation Ground

Li Ruochu was able to understand the grief that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was showing.

Chu Feng had entered the dark black gate for their sake.

Seeing someone sacrificing himself for their sake, she not only felt moved, but she also felt self-blame. If she were strong enough, how could she allow someone else to sacrifice himself? While sadness was a thing that would only last temporarily, self-blame would remain forever.

Thus, not to mention the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, even Li Ruochu felt very pained.

However, no matter how much grief they might feel, what could it possibly do?

“Senior, it is as you said, Chu Feng entered that gate for our sake.”

“Why did we brave such dangers to enter this place? Wasn’t it so that we would be able to gain the opportunity to increase our cultivations?”

“It is all thanks to Chu Feng that we were able to enter the Sacred Palace Hall. He has used his life to obtain this opportunity for us.”

“If you do not take advantage of this opportunity to train, you would’ve wasted Chu Feng’s kind intentions. Wouldn’t his sacrifice be in vain then?” Li Ruochu said.

“Lord Clan Chief, what Miss Li says is correct. Only by becoming strong will our clan not be bullied and humiliated by others. That is also precisely what Chu Feng wanted to see.”

“Although it might be inappropriate, we really must not miss out on this opportunity.”

At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s elders, regardless of whether they were sincere or not, also began to urge their Lord Clan Chief.

After all, if their Lord Clan Chief refused to train, they too would not be able to train.

None of them wanted to miss out on the opportunity before them.

“Clan Chief Chu, allow this old man to remind you that we are only able to be here for a limited amount of time. If you plan to train, you must hurry up.”

“Otherwise, I fear that you won’t have the opportunity to train even if you want to.”

A powerful voice stifled the voices of persuasion. It was the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

The Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief’s words did not seem like advice. Instead, it sounded more like a warning.

After the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he suddenly leapt forth towards one of the floating stone chairs.

Once he did that, the crowd all turned their gazes toward him.

They were all able to tell that those floating chairs were no small matter. It was merely that none of them dared to rashly approach them.

Now that someone else had decided to approach, they all wanted to see what would happen.

Before the crowd’s focus, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief arrived before the stone chair.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, dazzling light appeared. The previously simple and unadorned stone chair was shining with dazzling golden light like the bright sun.

That said, it was not only light. It seemed more like a barrier. That barrier was preventing the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief from ascending onto the stone chair.

After the golden brilliance appeared on the chair, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief also started to emit golden light from his body.

The golden light on the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief appeared very peculiar. Not only did it contain a faint veined pattern, but it was also emitting a very strong smell of fruit.

Shielded by the golden light, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief managed to successfully pass through the barrier emitted by the stone chair, successfully arrived atop the stone chair, and sat in it.

In the next moment, natural energies visible to the naked eye started to pour out of the stone chair and revolve around the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

Although those natural energies were all within the barrier, they captured the crowd’s eyes.

Evidently, after seeing the actions of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief, the crowd learned of the use of the floating stone chairs.

Those were cultivation treasures!!!

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

In the next moment, the experts present all soared into the sky with the intention of fighting over the stone chairs.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, soon, screams began to sound nonstop. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

It turned out that after they approached the stone chairs, the stone chairs all began to emit barriers.

That said, the people that rushed up to the stone chairs did not emit golden light from their bodies like the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief did.

Thus, they were unable to penetrate the barriers of the stone chairs, and instead collided ruthlessly with the powerful barriers.

At that moment, many people were covered in bruises. Those with lower levels of cultivation even suffered internal injuries from the collision.

“Why would it be like this?”

The injured crowd were all confused.

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, a muffled sound was heard. Someone’s body exploded.

It turned out, a person had flown toward the jade-like chair.

The jade-like chair was completely different from all the others. The barrier it emitted was also completely different. Someone had collided with that barrier and exploded into pieces.

“Heavens! That barrier!!!”

At that moment, the crowd all realized how terrifying that barrier was.

“Fools.”

“It’s one thing to attempt to ascend to the Void Seats. Yet, someone actually tried to ascend to the Sacred Tree Throne!!!”

Seeing the panicked and completely stupefied crowd, a mocking voice sounded. It was Zhang Yanfeng.

After Zhang Yanfeng said those words, the displeased crowd wanted to refute him. Some even wanted to teach him a lesson.

However, after a cold gaze swept down, those people all turned pale with fear. Not to mention teaching Zhang Yanfeng a lesson, they did not even dare to refute him.

That cold gaze came from a stone chair. It was the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

Even though the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief had ascended onto a stone chair, he did not immediately begin focused training. Instead, he was staring at the people below with a cold gaze.

The reason why he was acting like that was likely because he was afraid that some people might attack Zhang Yanfeng and the others after he started training.

That decision of his was extremely correct.

If it wasn’t for that cold gaze of his, the crowd that were furious after their failure in ascending to the stone chairs would really have ended up attacking Zhang Yanfeng.

“A bunch of cowards.”

Seeing the crowd that wanted to teach him a lesson become completely scared by a single gaze from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief, Zhang Yanfeng ruthlessly mocked them. Then, he took a step forward and leapt toward a stone chair.

His actions caught the attention of many of the people present.

The crowd all wanted to see what would happen during his attempt.

To the crowd’s surprise, after Zhang Yanfeng approached the stone chair, his body also started to emit a fruity fragrance and golden light like the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

With the golden light, Zhang Yanfeng also managed to successfully ascend onto a stone chair.

Seeing that Zhang Yanfeng had also ascended onto a stone chair and was enveloped by natural energies, the crowd felt enormous envy.

That said, what surprised the crowd the most was that after Zhang Yanfeng, Zhang Shirui, Zhang Boyi and many experts from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan also soared into the sky. Furthermore, they all managed to successfully reach their own stone chairs.
