Chapter 5955: Jie Tian Is Still Around?

Remnants tended to be obscure, either hidden underground or located in a remote mountain. Yet, the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant was a majestic city that sat in the middle of a plain, clear for all to see.

It had over a million palaces, and most of them were suitable for a normal-sized human to live in. Only the palace in the center of the city was unique.

That palace was a hundred times larger than that of the other palaces, towering over the others like an emperor. It naturally caught the attention of anyone entering the remnant.

Anyone could freely enter or leave the palaces, evident from how this city was filled with people. Many people had set up stores to sell their goods, and their business was not bad.

“Interesting.”

Chu Feng disguised himself before making his way into the city.

He was previously hesitant to disguise himself because someone kidnapped Zhao Hong and threatened him not to disguise himself. However, he had long suspected whether that person was friend or foe.

After all, there was no need for that person to beat around the bush if he wanted to deal with Chu Feng.

Later on, he encountered an emergency that left him no choice but to disguise himself. He wanted to see if that person would harm him or Zhao Hong if he disguised himself, or if it was just an empty scare.

In the end, nothing happened.

It could also be possible that the person who kidnapped Zhao Hong wasn’t so powerful as to be able to sense that Chu Feng had disguised himself. However, Chu Feng was inclined to believe that the other party was an elder who wanted to force him to grow, and Zhao Hong was safe.

Regardless, he was at least open to the idea of disguising himself now.

With the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion after him, it would be inconvenient for him to travel around if he couldn’t disguise himself.

It didn’t take long for Chu Feng to figure out what was going on here.

This entire city was the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant, and its million palaces previously contained treasures. However, most of the formations were breached over time, and the treasures inside those palaces were taken away.

The palaces that had their formations breached became accessible to the crowd, and some even chose to reside there.

Now, there was only one palace that remained unbreached, and that was the massive palace located at the center of the remnant.

When Chu Feng entered the massive palace’s spirit formation gate, he found that the palace was much larger than what he saw outside. Its size was even larger than the entire city itself. However, this was not a difficult feat for a powerful world spiritist.

The palace was mostly empty. The only thing that caught Chu Feng’s attention was a huge spirit formation gate located deep inside.

This spirit formation gate was interesting. There was a couplet hanging beside it.

Everyone has limits, but their limits vary. Only a dragon among humans may obtain the treasure here.

There was a plaque above the spirit formation gate that wrote: Enter with caution.

There were two huge silver shields beside the spirit formation gate. These two shields were around the same size as the spirit formation gate, but upon closer examination, they looked more like enlarged tokens.

There were two names on these enlarged tokens: Jie Tianran and Jie Tian.

“What is this?”

There were a handful of people in the palace, so Chu Feng randomly picked a man with freckles in the crowd and asked about it.

“You don’t know?”

The freckled man was taken aback. He quickly filled Chu Feng in about the situation.

Each of the two shields contained a formation realm. Skilled world spiritists could observe the shields and enter its formation realm to challenge its trial. There were two shields because they were divided into ‘Juniors’ and ‘Elders’.

Only the most talented individual in each era could breach the formation inside the shield. Those who breached the formation would obtain a ‘death immunity token’ that allowed them to freely enter and leave this remnant without fearing for their lives.

However, these two death immunity tokens had always been monopolized by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. For the longest time, the elder token had been monopolized by the incumbent Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, Jie Tianran.

As for the junior token, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s juniors took turns occupying it.

Anyone who was above a hundred years old would no longer be considered a junior, so once those who were holding onto the junior token exceeded a hundred years of age, their names would be erased from the shield. A new junior would then claim possession of it.

“Most people occupying the death immunity token were only able to trigger the silver token. Only one person in history has ever triggered the gold death immunity token. It’s rumored that the gold death immunity token comes with more benefits, but there’s no way to verify that,” the freckled man said.

“The person who triggered the gold death immunity token is Jie Ranqing, right?” Chu Feng asked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“You’re a smart one. Yes, it is Jie Ranqing. This shows that Elder Jie Ranqing is unrivaled not only in her generation but in the present one too. Even in the current generation, known to be the most talented generation in history, none could rival her,” the freckled man said.

“What about Ling Xiao? Has he not challenged this trial?” Chu Feng asked.

“The junior token has been occupied by Ling Xiao all this while, but a few days ago, Jie Tian came here and broke Ling Xiao’s record, thus leaving his name in place,” the freckled man said. “You have heard about Jie Tian, right?”

The freckled man switched to voice transmission before continuing, “He’s Lord Jie Tiannian and Lord Jie Mubai’s son, and he inherited the Ruler’s Bloodline. However, he was the first one to be eliminated in the recent Nine Heavens’ Zenith, so many speculated that he’s all talk.

“Judging from how Jie Tian broke Ling Xiao’s record, I’d say that he has substance, though I do wonder how he’d fare against Jie Ranqing’s son, Chu Feng. I’m personally leaning more toward Chu Feng.”

Chu Feng was intrigued to hear that. “Why do you lean toward Chu Feng?”

That question spurred the freckled man’s excitement, and he began explaining with exaggerated expressions.

“Chu Feng was the champion of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, and he possesses the Ruler’s Bloodline too. I heard that the prodigies who attended the Nine Heavens’ Zenith are filled with praises for him, though they dared not say anything in public out of fear of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“The juniors from an Ancient Era’s clan joined the Nine Heavens’ Zenith too, and they were incredibly arrogant. All of the juniors were suppressed by them, including Xianhai Shaoyu. However, Chu Feng stood forward and defeated them, thus protecting the dignity of present-day cultivators.”

“Does Chu Feng have such a good reputation?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“Of course! I doubt there are juniors who don't admire Chu Feng. You know the Totem Dragon Clan, right? There was a rebellion a while back. Why do you think Long Chengyu and the others were able to safely attend the Nine Heavens’ Zenith? It’s because Chu Feng saved them. He’s both strong and loyal; he’s a role model for us all!

“It’s just a pity that...” The freckled man suddenly sighed in regret.

“What’s a pity?” Chu Feng asked.

“It doesn’t seem like Chu Feng will be coming here. He doesn’t have any interest in the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnants, and I haven’t heard any news about him challenging any of the remnants either. If only he came, we would know who’s superior, him or Jie Tian.”
