Chapter 4060 - Made No Sense

Truth be told, after learning that the backing of the Wuming Clan was actually that powerful, Chu Feng had thought about a lot of things.

He seemed to understand why his father had been unwilling to have a complete falling-out with the Wuming Clan back then.

He felt that it must because his father knew that they were backed by the colossal Blue Talisman Clan.

After all, back then, Chu Xuanyuan hadn’t yet entered the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area to train. His cultivation must not have been as powerful as it was later on.

Furthermore, he was also being pursued by the colossal Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

In order to remain hidden, he had chosen to keep a low profile.

That said, it was clear to Chu Feng that the Blue Talisman Clan was not completely unreasonable.

At the very least, the conditions proposed by Lanfu Longping was very modest.

It was so modest that Chu Feng found himself somewhat incapable of understanding why he would propose such a condition.

Lanfu Longping clearly seemed to be trying to talk things over with Chu Feng.

But, with their strength, there was clearly no need for a discussion.

Because of that, Chu Feng felt that the situation was rather fishy.

Seeing Chu Feng’s slight hesitation, Lanfu Longping asked, “Young friend Chu Feng, is my condition to your satisfaction?”

“Humph, you speak pleasantly.”

“But, if it wasn’t for me being here today, the Chu Heavenly Clan would’ve been razed to the ground already.”

“Now you’re saying that you do not possess any malice, and are seeking peaceful coexistence? Who would possibly believe that?”

“I instead feel that you all are only saying such pleasant-sounding words because your strength is insufficient. Your goal is to escape and wait for reinforcements. Once your reinforcements arrive, your attitude will no longer be the same,” Bai Liluo suddenly spoke.

She did not believe in Lanfu Longping’s guarantee.

“Young lady, everything this old man has said is the truth.”

“If you don’t believe me, I am able to prove myself,” Lanfu Longping said to Bai Liluo.

“Very well, why don’t you prove yourself to me then,” Bai Liluo spoke with an expression that showed clear distrust.

“Boom~~~”

Right after Bai Liluo’s words left her mouth... the surrounding space started trembling.

No large disturbance had been created, yet the expressions of Chu Feng, Bai Liluo and even Wuming Doutian had all changed.

They were all able to sense Lanfu Longping’s aura.

He was emitting the aura of a rank seven Utmost Exalted.

He was not lying. If he really intended to unleash a massacre upon the Chu Heavenly Clan like that Lanfu Jianpeng, he could wipe them out at that exact moment.

Even though Bai Liluo was present, she would still not be a match for him.

“Young lady, do you believe me now?” Lanfu Longping asked Bai Liluo.

“You...”

“Humph!”

Bai Liluo remained somewhat unconvinced. She coyly let out a cold snort before saying, “I still refuse to believe you. Thus, you’d best keep your promise, for I, Bai Liluo, am not a pushover.”

“Young lady can rest assured, I, Lanfu Longping, guarantee that no one will dare touch the Chu Heavenly Clan again,” swore Lanfu Longping.

As he spoke, he actually bowed respectfully again.

Faced with such a respectful and courteous attitude, even the prideful Bai Liluo found herself unable to continue expressing her distrust.

Lanfu Longping was stronger than them. Yet, he was so courteous, and showed such etiquette.

Truth be told, he had provided a very ample amount of sincerity

“Senior, I accept your condition,” said Chu Feng. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Chu Feng had no choice but to accept the condition. He simply had no leeway to refuse.

Besides, he could not find any fault with Lanfu Longping’s condition.

“Young friend Chu Feng, our Blue Talisman Clan cannot be exposed. As such, I’ll have to ask you to keep these matters and what happened here, as well as our clan’s relationship with the Wuming Clan, confidential.”

“I will keep it confidential,” said Chu Feng.

“Thank you, young friend Chu Feng.”

“If there’s nothing else, we’ll be taking our leave now.”

After saying those words, Lanfu Longping grabbed Lanfu Jianpeng and prepared to leave.

“Wait.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng called out to him.

Chu Feng’s call immediately caused Lanfu Longping’s heart to leap.

In terms of cultivation, there was no reason for him to fear Chu Feng. However, he was definitely afraid of Chu Xuanyuan. Thus, he indirectly felt fear towards Chu Feng.

He was truly afraid that Chu Feng would try to make things difficult for them.

However, he still managed to ask calmly, “Young friend Chu Feng, is there anything else you need?”

“Senior, I have something that I wish to say to Wuming Doutian.”

Chu Feng turned to Wuming Doutian. “Wuming Doutian, I hope that you’ll be able to keep your promise and stop causing harm to the residents of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Else... even if your sons are to plead for you again, I Chu Feng, will not spare you.”

“The Ancestral Martial Starfield is now your Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory. I Wuming Doutian, will only stay in the Starfield Master Realm obediently.”

“Furthermore Chu Feng, some rumors are not trustworthy. I am actually not as wicked beyond redemption as the rumors make me seem. If the chance presents itself, we should have a proper chat. Perhaps your misunderstandings about me will be clarified then,” said Wuming Doutian.

“Young friend, please rest assured. If he dares to act willfully again, even if you decide to spare him, this old man will not spare him,” Lanfu Longping added.

Then, the three of them left.

......

After they left, a pensive look appeared on Chu Feng’s face.

“Little brother Chu Feng, what’s wrong?” asked Bai Liluo.

“Big sister Liluo, don’t you think that Lanfu Longping’s attitude is simply excessively good?”

“It seemed like he was somewhat afraid of us.”

“Especially when I called for them to stop when they were leaving earlier, I noticed that his body trembled the instant I called out to him.”

"His reaction didn’t make any sense at all” said Chu Feng.

“What’s there to worry about? Perhaps he’s afraid of me, your big sister.”

“After all, even though I’m no match for him right now, I will surpass him sooner or later,” said Bai Liluo proudly.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. “Mn, I think that must be the case. He must be afraid of my big sister Liluo.”

“Big sister Liluo, it is all thanks to you today. Otherwise, I truly wouldn’t dare imagine what would’ve happened to our Chu Heavenly Clan,” Chu Feng said with a serious expression.

“Don’t worry about it. With our relationship, there’s no need to be this courteous with me.”

“As long as you’re here, I will protect the entire Chu Heavenly Clan,” Bai Liluo guaranteed as she patted her chest.

“Wuu~~~”

Suddenly, the smile on her face disappeared, and was replaced with a look of pain.

Then, Bai Liluo was suddenly unable to stand firm.

Seeing this, Chu Feng immediately rushed forth to support her.

The moment he caught her, Chu Feng discovered that her body was ice-cold, and her internal aura was extremely chaotic. Whilst her outer body was ice-cold, her insides were scalding hot like magma, and surging and wreaking havoc.

“Big sister Liluo, what’s wrong?” Chu Feng started to panic. He could tell that Bai Liluo’s condition was very dangerous.

She might even die.

“It’s nothing, I’m alright. This is merely caused by forcibly leaving closed-door training,” Bai Liluo said with a smile.

Upon treating her condition, Chu Feng discovered that she was not lying.

Her condition had indeed been caused by her forcibly leaving closed-door training.

Fortunately, Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist now, and his bloodline had awakened, causing his world spirit techniques to be extremely powerful.

After being treated by Chu Feng, Bai Liluo’s condition finally began her better.
