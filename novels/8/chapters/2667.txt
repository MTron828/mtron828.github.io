Chapter 2667 - Important Matter To Report

“Humph.”

Faced with Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Lingxi pouted her lips and raised her face.

With a haughty attitude, she said, “Dear Lord Father, I came to find you right after returning.”

“Merely, Lord Father, you are simply too arrogant, no? Your daughter, I, have traveled far and hard to return and, out of filial piety, came to find you immediately. Yet you...”

“You actually refused to see me. If it wasn’t for those two’s appearance, I would likely not have been able to get to see you, no?”

After saying those words, Chu Lingxi cast a glance at the kneeling Chu Huai and Chu Yue. A displeased expression was present in her eyes.

“Foolish girl, your father had things to care of,” Chu Xuanzhengfa smiled. Then, he looked to Chu Huai and Chu Yue, “Chu Huai, Chu Yue, you can get up.”

After he said those words, he waved his sleeve, and a gentle power brought Chu Huai and Chu Yue to their feet.

After that, Chu Xuanzhengfa arrived at the Law Enforcement Hall’s Master Seat.

“The two of you have stated that you have something important to report that must be conveyed to me directly. What is it?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

However, before the two of them could speak, Chu Xuanzhengfa looked over to Chu Lingxi. He said, “You’ve finally gotten to see your father, why are you leaving already?”

It turned out that Chu Lingxi had gotten up, and was walking toward the exit of the Law Enforcement Hall.

“I am in no mood to listen to your troublesome things. I will return home first. If you want to see your daughter, you can find me at home later.”

“Oh, that’s right. There’s a limit of one hour. If you do not return in an hour, you will not be able to see me,” Chu Lingxi said haughtily.

Chu Xuanzhengfa shook his head with a smile. Then, he looked to Chu Huai and Chu Yue, “Go ahead and tell me exactly what the important matter is.”

“Milord, we have come mainly to report two things to you.”

“Firstly, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s Infant Soul Sect has been exterminated,” Chu Huai said.

“What? The Infant Soul Sect has been exterminated?”

Hearing those words, not only was the crowd inside the Law Enforcement Hall shocked, but even Chu Lingxi, who had arrived by the exit, stopped in her tracks. Then, she pulled back her raised foot and looked to Chu Huai and Chu Yue with quick-witted eyes.

“Are you certain?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Absolutely certain,” Chu Huai said.

“Who did it? Have you managed to discover that?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“It was done by a member of the younger generation by the name of Chu Feng,” Chu Huai said.

“Chu Feng?”

“Younger generation?”

Hearing those words, the gazes of the crowd all changed. Although they appeared to be undisturbed, they were all sending voice transmissions to one another and discussing the matter.

If it were some other power from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm that was eliminated, the people present would not even blink an eye.

However, the Infant Soul Sect was different. The Infant Soul Sect was a power that the Chu Heavenly Clan had not been able to eliminate for all these years.

In fact, many of the people present had challenged the Infant Soul Sect in their youth. However, it went without saying that all of them had returned in failure.

And now, someone had actually managed to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect. How could they not be shocked by the news?

Furthermore, it was a member of the younger generation.

“Is this Chu Feng a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“He shouldn’t be a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan,” Chu Huai said.

“Then, he shouldn’t be someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, no?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“No, he should be from some other Upper Realm. However, he is most definitely not from our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” Chu Huai said.

“You said that he’s a member of the younger generation, do you know his actual age?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“I am uncertain of his actual age. However, from my observation, he should have only just passed thirty years of age, and be no older than thirty-three,” Chu Huai said.

“Sssss~~~~” Hearing those words, many people present were unable to stop themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

Even Chu Xuanzhengfa’s expression changed. In fact, even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s demon-level genius, Chu Lingxi, revealed interest in her eyes.

She had already returned to the Law Enforcement Hall from the exit. Furthermore, she had found a seat and sat down.

Logically, it was rare for something to make people of their status react in such a manner.

Thus, it indirectly illustrated how enormous of a thing it was to them for Chu Feng to have eliminated the Infant Soul Sect.

Actually, there were quite a few from the various Upper Realms’ younger generations who were capable of eliminating the Infant Soul Sect. However, those capable of eliminating the Infant Soul Sect in their early thirties were extremely few.

At the very least, no one in the Chu Heavenly Clan was capable of accomplishing such a feat. This included the current five most talented demon-level geniuses. Even they were unable to accomplish that sort of thing at that age.

“Chu Huai, tell me all that you know about this Chu Feng,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

Chu Huai began to narrate all that he knew about Chu Feng to Chu Xuanzhengfa.

This included Chu Fang having obtained the inheritance of the Ancient Era’s War Clan.

He also mentioned that Chu Feng was not only a possessor of a Heavenly Bloodline, but also someone that trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, as well as having a heaven-defying Demon Armament.

Hearing those things, many of the people present were unable to remain calm anymore. Merely the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was already able to sway their composure.

The Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was something that no one in the current Chu Heavenly Clan had grasped.

Then, Chu Huai began to narrate what Chu Feng had experienced in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

He let the crowd know that Chu Feng’s cultivation was originally not strong. However, in a mere few years, his cultivation increased by leaps and bounds.

From a mere nobody at the beginning, he became someone who managed to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect, someone who managed to kill the Ginseng King of Evil and save the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

After hearing about all the things regarding Chu Feng, the crowd actually grew excited. Although those things had happened in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, they were sufficient to become known as a legend.

“In other words, you two do not know exactly which Heavenly Clan that Chu Feng is from?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“We are incompetent. We were unable to obtain that information from our investigations,” Chu Huai and Chu Yue said with ashamed expressions.

Although their mission in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm was to monitor the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation, they felt that their actual duty was to monitor everything that happened in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

After all, they possessed strength much superior to the people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

“You must immediately return to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to investigate. You must thoroughly investigate what that Chu Feng’s origin is. It is very possible for that Chu Feng to be our Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation’s strongest rival in the future,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Yes, Milord,” everyone from the Law Enforcement Hall spoke in unison.

“Milord, there is no need for that. That Chu Feng is already dead,” Chu Huai said.

“Dead? How did he die?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

Then, Chu Huai began to narrate to Chu Xuanzhengfa what he had witnessed.

After finding out that Chu Feng had been killed after being devoured by his Demon Armament, many of the people present started to feel a bit of joy.

It was as Chu Xuanzhengfa had said. A member of the younger generation like Chu Feng could very well become the strongest rival to their Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations in the future.

If a mishap were to happen to him, it would mean that there was one less opponent for their Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. To the Chu Heavenly Clan, this was a good thing.

However, compared to the great majority of the people in the Law Enforcement Hall, Chu Xuanzhengfa had a stern expression on his face. There was actually a trace of regret in his eyes.

“You said that you had two things to report. Apart from this, what else do you have to report?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“The person that made use of the Infant Soul Sect to undo the seal of the Ginseng King of Evil was a member of our clan, Chu Bore,” Chu Huai said.

“Bang~~~~”

Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa stood up abruptly. An ice-cold chilliness filled the entire palace hall. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
