MGA: Chapter 1756 - You Should Change Your Name

“Are you the Chu Feng who charged through the Heavenly Road alone from the Southern Sea Region and managed to successfully enter the Holy Land of Martialism?”

“Are you the Chu Feng who triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle in the territory of the Ancient Era’s Elves in the Cyanwood Domain?”

“Are you the Chu Feng who, upon entering the Cyanwood Mountain, was despised by many of his fellow disciples, yet defeated all of the Nine Powers’ disciples in the Nine Powers Hunt and became the strongest disciple of the Nine Powers?”

“Are you the Chu Feng who showed his absolute talent in the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s Island and obtained the number one position?”

“Are you the Chu Feng who was wanted by the Nangong Imperial Clan because of his outstanding talent, and then proceeded to defeat all of the Four Clans’ younger generation in the Mooncloud City’s competition?” Little Radish was staring at Chu Feng with a shocked expression and asked him many questions in a very serious manner.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng was startled. It was one thing for this boy to know about the matter of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s Island and Mooncloud City.

But, how come he even knew about Chu Feng’s origins being from outside the Holy Land of Martialism, that he had triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, as well as the things that had happened in the Cyanwood Mountain? Logically, there shouldn’t be that many people who knew about those things.

At the moment when Chu Feng was feeling disbelief at how much the boy knew, Little Radish suddenly revealed his teeth and smiled. Then he said, “I’m just joking. I know you’re not that Chu Feng. In this world, there are plenty of people with the same name and surname.”

“But then again, benefactor, Chu Feng is currently a very grand character. The Four Great Imperial Clans are extremely insistent on killing him. It’s best that you do not say your name casually, so that you don’t invite disaster on yourself.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. It turned out that this boy had been deliberately playing with him; he simply didn’t believe that this Chu Feng was that Chu Feng.

Regarding this, Chu Feng was disinclined to bother explaining. Instead, with a smile, he asked, “How do you know so much about that Chu Feng?”

“There’s nothing I can do about it, my senior sister Chili Pepper is that Chu Feng’s superfan. After she came to know that Chu Feng was a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain, she spent a great amount of money to inquire of the Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples about Chu Feng.”

“While it’s one thing for her to know about all this, she would frequently mention that Chu Feng to us. Say, how could I not know about Chu Feng then?” Little Radish said.

“There’s actually such a thing?” At this moment, Chu Feng was surprised. He had not expected that there was someone that worshipped him like that in the Underworld Palace. Furthermore, judging by what the boy said, it was a woman.

“However, speaking of this matter, that Chu Feng is truly amazing. He’s growing up in the midst of predicaments. Furthermore, the speed of his growth is extremely fast. Reportedly, when he first arrived in the Holy Land of Martialism, his cultivation seemed to only be that of a Martial Lord. However, his cultivation is already that of a Half Martial Emperor now. His speed is truly frightening. Sigh, if only I had that Chu Feng’s talent,” Little Radish sighed in envy.

“Little Radish, what ill words regarding Chu Feng are you spouting now?” Right at this moment, a sharp voice suddenly sounded.

“Ah, not-nothing,” Hearing this voice, Little Radish immediately displayed a deep sign of respect, hurriedly stood straight and started to smile innocently. Evidently, he deeply feared the person who just spoke out.

Turning toward the direction of the voice, Chu Feng discovered that a woman was rapidly walking over. Although this woman did not possess an outstanding appearance, her figure was extremely hot. She belonged to the type that would cause others to drool just by looking at their bodies. The person who spoke earlier was precisely this woman.

At this moment, this woman’s eyes were shining as she stared at Little Radish. It was as if she were interrogating him with her eyes.

Behind this woman followed a man. At this moment, this man had an expression of anger on his face. He too was staring at Little Radish.

That man possessed the cultivation of a rank eight Martial King, whereas that sexy woman had the cultivation of a rank nine Martial King. With their cultivations at their ages, they could not be considered to be weak. At least, when placed in the Nine Powers, the two of them would be peak existences.

A thing worthy of being mentioned was that the man’s appearance actually resembled Little Radish’s. Furthermore, the man and woman were both wearing the same apparel as Little Radish; they were both disciples of the Underworld Palace.

Without thinking much about it, Chu Feng had managed to guess that the two of them must be together with Little Radish. Furthermore, that man was most likely the big brother that Little Radish had spoken of.

“Zhao Tuo, what’s with you? Why did you secretly charge into that forest when I wasn’t paying attention to you? Do you know how dangerous that forest is?”

“If you had died, how was I going to explain myself to father and mother, to grandfather, to our clansmen?” Sure enough, that man who had arrived following that woman was extremely enraged. He pointed his finger at Little Radish and began to reprimand him.

“That’s right. Brat, look at what you’ve done. You’ve made your big brother Big Radish so scared that he pissed his pants,” the woman added.

“Chili Pepper, what are you saying? Since when was I so scared that I pissed my pants?” Hearing those words, that Big Radish’s expression immediately changed and he started to question her.

“You’re still not admitting to it? Look at your pants...” That woman had a mischievous smile on her face as she pointed at the man’s crotch. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At this moment, Chu Feng discovered that there were indeed traces of wetness of having pissed one’s pants on that man’s crotch.

“This... wasn’t this when I accidentally spilled the water I was holding in my hand after becoming worried when you told me that Little Radish had disappeared?” The man hurriedly explained.

“Haha, with how much you worried about Little Radish, isn’t it all fine that Little Radish is safe? Why bother to reprimand and scold him? Would that even make you feel more comfortable? With how young he is, to be publicly scolded by you like that, do you not fear that you’ll leave some trauma in his heart?” The woman said with a brilliant smile.

“I...” The man looked to Little Radish, and then looked to the woman. He became speechless.

“Hehe, senior sister Chili Pepper is the best,” At this moment, Little Radish was overjoyed. He knew that his senior sister Chili Pepper was helping him.

“Stinky brat, what ill were you saying about Chu Feng earlier?” However, that senior sister Chili Pepper’s face immediately turned cold as she questioned Little Radish again.

“Not, not... nothing. I didn’t say any ill words about Chu Feng. I was only praising Chu Feng. If you don’t believe me, you can ask my benefactor,” Little Radish pointed to Chu Feng.

“Benefactor?” Senior sister Chili Pepper and Big Radish were startled. Then, they looked to Chu Feng.

“Eh... it’s like this. I... I encountered ferocious beasts on my journey. It was this benefactor that saved me and brought me here,” Seeing that he had made a mishap and leaked what had happened, Little Radish could only tell the entire truth.

“I knew that you would not be able to pass through that forest on your own,” Big Radish hit Little Radish’s head. Then, he walked over to Chu Feng.

“Thank you, brother, for your help. I am Zhao Kai, Zhao Tuo’s big brother. If benefactor does not mind, you can address me as Big Radish. That is what all those that know me well address me as,” Big Radish immediately offered his thanks and greeting to Chu Feng.

Senior sister Chili Pepper also walked over and said, “You can call me Chili Pepper. That’s what everyone calls me.” Even though she said those words very casually, she was grinning from ear to ear as she looked at Chu Feng. After all, she was also very grateful that Chu Feng had saved Little Radish. Thus, her impression of Chu Feng was extremely good.

As for Chu Feng, he began to smile in his heart. These three people were truly interesting. Even though they all had regular names, they instead gave each other these sorts of nicknames.

However, this gave Chu Feng a good impression of them. After all, generally, only those with extremely good relationships with one another would give each other these sorts of nicknames and use them unrestrainedly.

“Pleased to meet you,” Chu Feng clasped his fist toward the two of them.

“May I ask, how shall I address you brother?” Big Radish asked.

“Haha, big brother, you’ll definitely not believe this if I tell you. My benefactor has a very amazing name,” Little Radish interrupted.

“Amazing name? What name? Quickly, let me hear it,” Senior sister Chili Pepper showed an expression of curiosity as she asked in high spirits.

“Hehe, he’s called Chu Feng,” Little Radish said.

“What? Chu Feng?” Hearing those words, senior sister Chili Pepper’s long, shapely eyebrows started to crease. Then, with a serious expression on her face, she asked Chu Feng, “Your name really is Chu Feng?”

“I am indeed called Chu Feng,” Chu Feng nodded.

However, after obtaining Chu Feng’s verification, that senior sister Chili Pepper’s smile instantly disappeared. With an expressionless face, she said, “You should change your name.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. Throughout his life, he had experienced many things. However, it was the first time he had seen someone that wanted him to change his name. Thus, he asked, “Why?”

“Why? You’re asking me why?!”

“Very well, I’ll tell you why. The name Chu Feng is not a name that just anyone can have. Your name being Chu Feng is simply an insult to the name Chu Feng. Change your name,” Senior sister Chili Pepper said with a serious expression and in an aggressive manner.
