Chapter 3822 - The Copper Gate’s Rainbow Light

Those people of the younger generation had accepted the invitations to take the test because they all wanted to see Yuan Shu.

Now that they’d learned that only a single person would be able to see Yuan Shu, they were not only greatly disappointed, but they were also extremely displeased.

“What is the meaning of Lord Yuan Shu’s words? He is clearly the one that invited us here.”

“Not only has he set up hurdles to make things difficult for us, but only a single person is able to meet him? If that’s the case, why did he bother to invite all of us here?”

“That’s right. If I had known this would be the case, I wouldn’t have come.”

At that moment, the people of the younger generation present were all complaining.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the space started to distort. A spirit formation gate actually appeared in the palace hall.

“If anyone wishes to leave, you can leave.”

A voice sounded from the spirit formation gate. It was Lord White Gown’s voice.

That said, his current voice was filled with displeasure.

At that moment, the people of the younger generation that had been complaining earlier all shut their mouths.

“Lord White Gown, that is not our intention.” Li Xiao and the others tried to explain with beaming smiles on their faces.

“If anyone plans to continue, then walk onward. Even if only a single person will be able to see Lord Yuan Shu, there will be gifts prepared by Lord Yuan Shu throughout the journey. Of course, it will be up to your own ability and luck as to whether or not you can obtain anything." Lord White Gown’s voice sounded again.

“Thank you, Lord White Gown.”

With smiles on their faces, Li Xiao and the others clasped their fists respectfully. Even though Lord White Gown was merely transmitting his voice through a world spirit technique and had not revealed his actual self, they still acted very respectfully.

Those people had truly enacted what it meant to be a hypocrite perfectly.

Meanwhile, Yin Zhuanghong walked towards the opened gate.

Seeing that, the crowd immediately followed her. They were all afraid of missing out.

After they passed through the spirit formation gate, a forest appeared before them. The forest was located in a mountain range. Singing birds and fragrant flowers were present all around. That forest truly resembled a paradise.

There was only a single narrow path in the forest. Yin Zhanghong and that man lead the way, and the other younger generations followed closely behind them. No one dared to proceed elsewhere on their own.

After all, they all knew that the forest was not an ordinary place. If they were inattentive in the slightest, they might fall into a trap. Thus, it was safer for them to follow Yin Zhuanghong and that man.

“Miss Yin is truly a well-concealed expert. You actually managed to breach the spirit formation from earlier before me.”

That man arrived beside Yin Zhuanghong and spoke to her with a beaming smile on his face. That smile of his was very eager and attentive.

Even a fool could tell that he was interested in her.

“It was luck," said Yin Zhuanghong. Her attitude was still very cold and detached.

This was normal. After all, Yin Zhuanghong was cold to even the so-called number one genius of the All-heaven Starfield, Nangong Yifan. Thus, how could she show concern for that man?

Even if he was rather outstanding among the people of the younger generation, he was much inferior when compared to Nangong Yifan.

That said, it seemed like the man was accustomed to her coldness. He was not discouraged, and instead continued to talk to Yin Zhuanghong. Even though she would only occasionally respond to him, and very tersely on top of that, the man still smiled and felt exceptionally joyous. It was as if Yin Zhuanghong was already showing favor to him by being willing to speak to him.

Recalling how cold Yin Zhuanghong was back then, Chu Feng felt that she had indeed changed somewhat.

Although Yin Zhuanghong was still extremely cold, compared to her behavior towards Nangong Yifan, she seemed to be slightly more cordial toward that man.

That’s right. She was slightly more cordial.

This made Chu Feng curious as to what sort of ability the man possessed to be able to make Yin Zhuanghong change her behavior towards him.

“Brother, are you really called Asura?”

Suddenly, a figure approached Chu Feng. It was that man by the name of Fan Chou.

“What do you think of my name?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

Chu Feng did not have a good impression of the majority of the people present. That man, however, was an exception.

Thus, Chu Feng was willing to chat with him.

“That’s a great name. The implication of Asura surpasses that of Demons. However, they still stand on the side of righteousness.”

“To possess power even more sinister than demons, yet be the embodiment of justice.”

“Asura World Spiritists serve to be the greatest proof of that.”

Fan Chou praised Chu Feng’s name nonstop.

That Fan Chou was truly fond of talking. That said, he was not someone who acted eagerly attentive, trying to flatter someone. Rather, he was purely talkative. His words were not provocative either. Because of that, Chu Feng was rather fond of talking with him.

As the crowd journeyed onward, many hurdles appeared ahead of them. Occasionally, treasures would also appear.

However, before Chu Feng could even do anything, those hurdles were all resolved by the man who was particularly attentive of Yin Zhuanghong.

As for the treasures, they were all minor gadgets. Chu Feng had no intention of scrambling for the treasures at all. Yin Zhuanghong and that man were not interested either. Because of that, Li Xiao and others ended up obtaining a lot of treasures.

Through chatting with Fan Chou the entire time, Chu Feng not only came to know Fan Chou rather well, but he also learned from Fan Chou who that man was.

The man’s name was Meng Rufei.

In the Reincarnation Upper Realm, Meng Rufei could be said to be a top tier character.

Among the people of the younger generations, Yin Zhuanghong was the strongest female, whereas Meng Rufei was the strongest male.

Meng Rufei did not belong to any sect or school. However, he had a very powerful master.

His master was named Zhang Duotuo. People addressed him as Grandmaster Duotuo.

This Grandmaster Duotuo was a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Besides Lord Yuan Shu, he was deemed to be one of the strongest world spiritists in the All-heaven Starfield.

Because of that, Meng Rufei was not only very strong and talented, but he also had a very powerful background.

It was no wonder those arrogant and conceited people of the younger generation were so respectful towards Meng Rufei, and afraid to offend him.

Furthermore, because of Meng Rufei’s existence, even though they were also interested in Yin Zhuanghong, none of them dared to step forward to court her.

That said, if that was all Meng Rufei was, there would be no reason for Yin Zhaunghong to treat him favorably.

Chu Feng became very curious as to exactly why she was not as cold towards Meng Rufei. If they didn’t already possess a close relationship, it would likely mean there was some sort of hidden matter between them.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, the ground started trembling, and strong winds surged. The gale sent the crowd’s clothes and hair fluttering in the wind. Some people were even blown back.

It turned out that there was a wall ahead of them. That wall had sealed both heaven and earth. A copper gate served as the only exit. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, that copper gate was currently closed.

The unsealing formation Meng Rufei had set up earlier was for the sake of breaching that copper gate.

The copper gate was actually what was really trembling. The ground was merely affected by its trembling.

“Brother Fan Chou, the situation seems amiss. Be careful.”

Chu Feng pulled Fan Chou with him as he retreated.

“The situation seems to be amiss. Miss Yin, let’s fall back.”

Meng Rufei also wanted to pull Yin Zhuanghong and retreat. However, he did not manage to grab her, as Yin Zhuanghong had already moved backwards at the time as he said those words.

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, the copper gate opened. A rainbow light flew out of the copper gate.

The rainbow light charged into the crowd. Terrified by the rainbow light, the people of the younger generation immediately started dodging in all directions with all their strength.

However, after the rainbow light charged past the crowd, it actually turned around and charged into the crowd again.

This completely terrified the crowd. Afraid of being struck, they began to avoid the rainbow light nonstop.

While the crowd were all dodging, Chu Feng was observing the rainbow light. Soon, he stopped avoiding the rainbow light, and instead started flying toward it.

At practically the same time as Chu Feng started flying towards the rainbow light, Yin Zhuanghong did the same.

“Miss Yin, be careful! That’s very dangerous!”

Seeing Yin Zhuanghong flying towards the rainbow light, Meng Rufei shouted to warn her.

However, not only did Yin Zhuanghong ignore him, but she instead continued to chase after the rainbow light.

Chu Feng knew very well why Yin Zhuanghong acted that way. That rainbow light was not a dangerous weapon at all. Instead, it might be a very useful treasure.
