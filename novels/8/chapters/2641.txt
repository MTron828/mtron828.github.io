Chapter 2641 - Arrival Of Doomsday

“Woosh~~~”

Right at the moment when Wang Qiang obtained the power of the spirit formation and strengthened his battle power, that Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster rushed toward him.

Faced with the incoming Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, Wang Qiang again did not cower. He too rushed forth to confront him. He wanted to have a final confrontation against the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

The reason for that was because Wang Qiang knew very well that he had no way out of this apart from fighting with his all.

However, right after they started fighting, Wang Qiang was shocked to discover that he was unable to defeat the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. Even though he had obtained the assistance of the allied army’s power, he was still no match for the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

“Puu~~~”

Soon, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s Dragonscale Dagger struck Wang Qiang.

With that one strike, Wang Qiang’s flesh was cut open. Even his bones were injured by the slash. From this, it could be seen how powerful the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s attack was.

However, that was merely the beginning. Following that......

Another slash, two slashes, three slashes, four slashes, five slashes......

Soon, Wang Qiang was covered with wounds. His body had become badly mutilated. He had become completely bloodied.

Most importantly, as Wang Qiang continued to be struck by the slashes, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster managed to assail Wang Qiang’s body with the strange dark black gaseous flames emitted by his Infant Soul Demonic Technique.

Soon, Wang Qiang started to scream miserably in pain. His aura also started to grow weaker and weaker. Not long afterward, he lost the ability to continue fighting, and could only allow himself to be thrashed around.

“Bastard, get the hell away from my husband!”

How could Zhao Hong possibly contain herself after seeing this? She immediately grabbed her Ancestral Armament and rushed forth.

Immediately afterward, Ying Mingchao, Zi Xunyi and everyone else from the allied army rushed forth.

They were all prepared for death the moment they’d decided to attack. They knew that they would either eliminate the Infant Soul Sect or die trying.

“Hahaha. Come at me, come all at once. I shall see who can possibly stop me today.”

Even though he was surrounded, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster burst into loud laughter. He began to shuttle through the allied army.

Regardless of what sort of ability the crowd tried to use, not a single person was able to injure him in the slightest.

However, the Dragonscale Dagger in his hand was like a butcher’s knife. It streaked across the bodies of the crowd repeatedly. Blood splattered about all over the place. This was truly a miserable scene.

It was like a group of little hares were gathered around a tiger. Although they were not afraid of dying and extremely aggressive, the enormous disparity in strength made it so that they were unable to harm that tiger in the slightest. All that they could do was to allow themselves to receive a beating.

Although the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster attacked savagely, he left only superficial wounds on the crowd, and did not kill anyone. He merely mutilated everyone and left them covered in wounds.

It was not only the men, even Zhao Hong, Zi Xunyi and the other women were not spared by him.

However, the wounds he left were most definitely not merely superficial wounds. The reason for that was because black gaseous flames assailed their bodies through the wounds.

The entire allied army was affected by the black gaseous flames. They became an army without the strength to battle, without strength to even stand.

Seemingly deliberately humiliating Ying Mingchao and the others, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster set up a prison cell with his spirit power and then tossed everyone from the allied army into that prison cell.

That prison cell was floating in the sky, and was very noticeable. Furthermore, as it was very large, the people down below were all able to notice it.

What the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster had done could be said to be extremely inhumane.

However, not only was he not criticized by the crowd, he was instead showered with cheers and praise.

“Long live Lord Sectmaster! Despicable vile things like them should be punished!”

“This sort of punishment is simply not sufficient at all! You should kill them all! Only by killing them all will we be safe! Only by killing them all will our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm be peaceful!”

There were even those that shouted for the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster to kill Wang Qiang and the others.

Even though Wang Qiang and the others had never done anything wrong to them, these people were acting as if Wang Qiang and the others had killed their parents. They were truly ruthless.

Zi Xunyi was lying beside Ying Mingchao. With a weak voice, she asked, “Mingchao, don’t you regret that we’ve fought for people like them?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I do regret fighting for them. However, I don’t regret fighting against the Infant Soul Sect. Merely, I...”

As he saw Zi Xunyi beside him, as he saw her filled with wounds and changed beyond recognition, Ying Mingchao started to choke with emotions.

She was his most beloved woman. Yet now, she was tortured to such a state. But he was helpless to do anything about it.

He felt extremely pained in his heart. He started to blame himself for being so powerless.

“Everyone, don’t be so anxious. They will definitely receive their punishment.”

“However, before that, I wish to have everyone witness the power of our Infant Soul Grand Formation,” the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster said.

“Lord Sectmaster, are you planning to activate the Infant Soul Grand Formation now?”

The crowd was immediately overjoyed upon hearing those words. After all, they had all traveled far and wide to this place for that Infant Soul Grand Formation, that grand formation capable of helping them increase their cultivation.

“That’s right, of course. Everyone, prepare yourselves for ascension to a higher state.”

After saying those words, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster started to form hand seals. Then, dark black gaseous flames started to emit from everyone from the Infant Soul Sect. The dark black gaseous flames shot directly to the sky and formed an enormous formation.

As for that dark black grand formation, it was the so-called Infant Soul Grand Formation.

Merely, compared to last time, it was much more imposing.

Like an enormous range of black clouds, this grand formation filled the entire sky and completely covered the hundreds of millions of people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm within it.

It was spinning and surging about.

Even though such a thing clearly looked like the arrival of a camality, the hundreds of millions of people down below did not feel the slightest bit of fear. Instead, they were all showing ecstatic expressions.

Cheering and excited noises were sounding from the vast crowd nonstop.

“Everyone, this Infant Soul Grand Formation is capable of helping you all increase your cultivation. However, you all must remember one thing firmly.”

“The Infant Soul Grand Formation will cover you all, assimilate itself into you and fuse with your souls.”

“At that time, you all must relax and willingly accept its powers, willingly allow its powers to enter you and fuse with your souls. You must not resist it.”

“The reason for that is because that is the only way for the Infant Soul Grand Formation to instill martial comprehension to you all. Else... you will have wasted the power of the Infant Soul Grand Formation. If you fail to obtain martial comprehension, do not blame the formation for being ineffective,” the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster said.

“We will definitely not let down Lord Sectmaster’s kind intentions.”

“Lord Sectmaster, go ahead and begin the operation of the Infant Soul Grand Formation. We can wait no longer. We really want to fuse with the grand formation.”

“That’s right, we truly want to enjoy the power of the Infant Soul Grand Formation sooner.”

“Lord Sectmaster, please begin. Everyone here will firmly remember your kindness, we will firmly remember this grand day.”

The hundreds of millions of people were all shouting excitedly. They were all impatient to fuse with the Infant Soul Grand Formation.

They were so excited that none of them noticed that a smile had emerged on the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s fleshless skull-like face.

That smile was ice-cold, wicked and frightening.

“Rest assured, I will make sure that everyone receives the power of the Infant Soul Grand Formation.”

After the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster finished saying those words, countless dark black gaseous flames started to surge from the Infant Soul Grand Formation. They descended straight down and landed on the hundreds of millions of people below.

Each dark black gaseous flame would reach a single person. They began to rapidly cover that person and completely seal them off.

At that moment, Ying Mingchao, Zi Xunyi, Zhao Hong, Wang Qiang and the others that were trapped in the prison cell started to resist their injuries and looked down below.

They all wanted to see exactly what conspiracy the Infant Soul Sect was plotting. They all felt that the foundation of the plot should be that Infant Soul Grand Formation.

“Buzz~~~”

Soon, the dark black gaseous flames that covered the vast crowd below started to glow with light blue light.

Ying Mingchao and the others felt that those light blue lights should be coming from the people that those gaseous flames covered.

The reason for that was because even though they were all emitting light blue light, the intensity of the light was different. The ones that shone brighter should be emitted by those with stronger cultivations.

As for those weak lights, they should be emitted by those with a weak level of cultivation.

“Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz~~~”

Suddenly, those blue lights started to be removed. Following the dark black gaseous flames, they emerged in the Infant Soul Grand Formation.

“Eeeaahhh~~~~~~~~~~~~~”

The next moment, miserable screams began to be heard from the millions of people.

Those screams were truly miserable. It was as if they were being tormented by thousands of blades. If a single person was to let out that sort of scream, it would be enough to cause others to feel panicky and uneasy.

When hundreds of millions of people all let out that sort of scream at the same time, it was truly frightening.

One would feel as if doomsday had arrived. Ninety percent of all the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm were suffering from danger to their lives.
