Chapter 2008 - Deliberately Making Things Difficult

“Are you implying that while your Mortal King Palace’s people are innocent, our Cyanwood Mountain’s people are not? That your lives are valuable, whereas our lives have no value? That you all can kill us as you wish?”

“If it wasn’t for the Ancient Era’s Elves, the Underworld Palace, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Four Great Imperial Clans coming to assist us today, our Cyanwood Mountain would have been razed to the ground by your Mortal King Palace. All the people of our Cyanwood Mountain would have been killed by you all.”

“At that time, who would have felt sympathy for us?” Chu Feng asked in succession. He appeared to be very emotional. If possible, he truly wished to kill the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master, this shameless old bastard.

“What little friend Chu Feng says is correct. The way I see it, there is simply no need for compensation. We should just directly eliminate them,” Elder Huang Guan from the Underworld Palace said loudly.

“That’s right, we don’t need any compensation. No matter how much you compensate us, you will not be able to bring back our brothers who died at your hands. What use is compensation? We merely want the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace to pay this debt of blood with blood.”

Following that, the crowd from the Underworld Palace, King Monstrous Dragon Race, Four Great Imperial Clans and Cyanwood Mountain all began to loudly shout in unison.

Their voices were like thunder, and their killing intent was overflowing. They were not joking around. They truly wanted the death and destruction of the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace.

Faced with this sort of situation, the expressions of the crowd from the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace became very ugly. Many among them were shivering in fear. They truly did not wish to die, and were deeply afraid of death.

“......” This sort of situation left the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master speechless. He had not expected Chu Feng to be this powerful. He had not expected Chu Feng to be able to stir up the will of the crowd even more skillfully than him.

The current situation was simply akin to being the will of the crowd. Even if Chu Feng were to order the eradication of their Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace, no one would blame Chu Feng for it.

Thus, the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master ended up gritting his teeth. Feeling enormous pain and unwillingness, he said, “Fine. I agree to little friend Chu Feng’s demand. I will compensate them.”

Chu Feng smiled coldly at the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master’s compliance. He had already seen through the nature of the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master, and knew that he was a coward that was afraid of death. Thus, Chu Feng already knew that he would have this sort of response. Thus, Chu Feng did not bother much with the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master. Instead, he turned directly to the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master and asked, “What about the Heavenly Law Palace?”

“Our Heavenly Law Palace also accepts little friend Chu Feng’s demand,” With the prior case of the Mortal King Palace, the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master naturally would not dare to go against Chu Feng’s demand.

The winner was the king and the loser was the thief. And now, he could only admit his defeat and suffer the consequences.

“Since there are no objections, you all can fulfill your promise now,” Chu Feng said.

“Right now?” Hearing those words, the two Palace Masters’ expressions stiffened again.

“Do you have any complaints?” Chu Feng asked.

“Our Imperial Armaments and Incomplete Imperial Armaments are all mastered items right now. If we are to hand them over now, even if they are to obtain them, they would not be able to master them,” The two Palace Masters said in unison.

“Do you not know how to sever the connection? It’s alright if you don’t. I am able to help you all. Merely, I might be a bit harsh, and might even kill someone through severing their connection to their weapons,” Chu Feng said.

“Snap~~~”

Hearing what Chu Feng said, the two Palace Masters clenched their fists tightly.

Threatening. Chu Feng was openly threatening them. However, even when faced with this sort of threat, they had no choice but comply.

“Very well, we’ll do as little friend Chu Feng said,” In the end, the two of them decided to comply with Chu Feng’s demand.

Thus, the experts from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace began to publicly sever their connections with their weapons. This was the most disastrous for the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master. Due to the fact that the Mortal King Palace only possessed six Imperial Armaments altogether, they had to hand over all six of their Imperial Armaments. As such, even the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master had to sever his connection with his weapon. At the moment when he handed over his Imperial Armament, he truly felt as if his heart was bleeding.

While the reaction from the Underworld Palace’s crowd was still calm, when the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Four Great Imperial Clans all received two Imperial Armaments and forty Incomplete Imperial Armaments each, they felt extremely excited.

The Incomplete Imperial Armaments that the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace possessed were all of extremely high quality. They were all top quality weapons.

It was not that the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace did not want to hand over low quality Incomplete Imperial Armaments. Rather, it was Chu Feng who had refused the low quality Incomplete Imperial Armaments.

As for the Imperial Armaments, they were incomparably precious to the Four Great Imperial Clans and the King Monstrous Dragon Race. For them to suddenly obtain two Imperial Armaments each, they were truly overjoyed.

Merely those two Imperial Armaments and forty Incomplete Imperial Armaments had made their assistance to the Cyanwood Mountain completely worth it.

At the moment when the six powers were feeling joy, many people from the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace were crying. Yes, they were truly crying with tears.

By handing over those weapons, they had completely emptied their foundations. Likely, they would never again be able to obtain their former heights.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng said, “Next, it should be time for you all to compensate our Cyanwood Mountain,”

‘What? More compensation? Didn’t you say that it would do to just compensate the six powers? That the Cyanwood Mountain doesn’t need compensation? Why are you requesting compensation now?’

Hearing those words, the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters were terrified. However, regardless of what they thought in their hearts, they could not say it out loud. As such, they could only smile wryly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What’s wrong? Do you all not wish to compensate us? Are you implying that the casualties that our Cyanwood Mountain suffered should be disregarded?” Chu Feng asked with a stern voice.

“No, that’s not our intention at all. Little friend Chu Feng, what do you wish in compensation?” The two Palace Masters asked with bitter smiles on their faces. If it wasn’t for the fact that they would have to consider their status, the two of them would have cried with tears at this time.

“It’s very simple, just compensate our Cyanwood Mountain with the same compensation you gave the six powers,” Chu Feng said.

“What? Little friend Chu Feng, you’re... you’re making things difficult for us. We have already handed over all that we can as compensation.”

“You want the same sort of compensation? Not only are we unable to offer that sort of compensation now, we will not be able to offer that sort of compensation in the future either.”

“After all, what we had handed over as compensation earlier were things that we accumulated through several tens of thousands of years. Right now, we have already handed all of them over,” The Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master said.

“You can’t hand over the compensation? That’s fine, you can do it slowly.”

“However, you all must write a certificate of indebtedness,” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out two bamboo slips. He wrote some things on them and then said, “Done. You all can sign them now.”

At that moment, the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters were speechless. Chu Feng had done all these things in a very natural and flowing manner. Evidently, he had prepared this to begin with.

At that moment, they truly regretted their decisions. If they knew that Chu Feng would deliberately make things difficult for them in such a manner, they would have chosen their deaths instead.

Of course, this was merely what they thought. If they could survive, they would naturally do everything to survive. As such, before the eyes of countless individuals, they signed Chu Feng’s certificates of indebtedness and imprinted them with their fingerprints.

“That’s strange,” Chu Feng said.

“What’s strange? We have already signed the certificate of indebtedness according to your demands. What else do you demand from us?” The two Palace Masters said in an annoyed manner.

“You two have written your own names, and not the names of the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace. If the two of you are to die without paying off the debt, who am I supposed to find to collect the debt?” Chu Feng asked.

At that moment, the two Palace Masters were so angry that their faces turned ashen. They did not expect for Chu Feng to be such a cautious individual. However, to them, Chu Feng’s cautiousness was simply deliberately making things difficult for them.
