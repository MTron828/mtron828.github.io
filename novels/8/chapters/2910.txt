Chapter 2910 - Song Yunfei’s Provocation

The black blade held by the Ghost Sect Hall’s elder continued to descend one blade at a time. As Black Crystal Stones continued to fall to the ground, the Immortal Martial Stones hidden within the Black Crystal Stones began to appear unceasingly.

In the end, from that meter tall lump of Black Crystal Stone, a half-meter tall oval-shaped lump of Immortal Martial Stone appeared.

If this lump of Immortal Martial Stone were to be cut into standard Immortal Martial Stones, it would capable of creating over three thousand Immortal Martial Stones.

As for Chu Feng, he had only paid eight hundred Immortal Martial Stones to purchase it.

In other words, Chu Feng had managed to make a profit of over two thousand Immortal Martial Stones this time around.

"Young Hero Chu Feng, you are simply too amazing. You actually managed to make such an enormous profit from the first Black Crystal Stone you’ve cut open. Your luck is simply unparalleled."

At that moment, the people that were previously thinking Chu Feng’s eyesight to be lacking actually began to praise him with admiration on their faces.

"To be able to cut open such a good Black Crystal Stone on one’s first attempt, it is the first time this old man had witnessed such a thing even though I’ve been here for so long."

"Young Master Chu Feng’s eyesight is truly discerning."

Even that Ghost Sect Hall’s elder was unable to keep himself from praising Chu Feng.

"Young Master Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. You actually managed to cut open such a large lump of Immortal Martial Stone. That Immortal Martial Stone is at least sufficient to be cut into three thousand standard Immortal Martial Stones, no?"

Suddenly, a sweet-sounding voice was heard. At that moment, the surrounding crowd all turned their eyes toward the voice.

It was Xia Yun’er. Xia Yun’er had heard the commotion, and immediately walked over.

Furthermore, she was also holding a lump of Immortal Martial Stone in her lily-white hand. Although that lump of Immortal Martial Stone was also quite valuable, it looked slightly inferior when compared to Chu Feng’s Immortal Martial Stone.

Chu Feng’s lump of Immortal Martial Stone was capable of being split into over three thousand standard-sized Immortal Martial Stones, whereas the lump Xia Yun’er held in her hand was only capable of producing a thousand standard-sized Immortal Martial Stones at the very most.

"That’s the Immortal Martial Stone Song Yunfei helped her obtain, right? It’s doesn’t look like much either," Her Lady Queen mocked.

The reason for that was because it was not only Xia Yun’er who had walked over. Song Yunfei, Ren Xiaoyao and the others had also followed her over.

Furthermore, judging from Song Yunfei’s hatred-filled eyes, he had most definitely come here with ill-intent in mind.

"Brother Chu Feng, so you were actually also proficient in examining Black Crystal Stones? One truly cannot judge a book by its cover."

"Since that’s the case, how about the two of us compete with one another?" Sure enough, Song Yunfei immediately spoke his mind. He had come to pick a fight with Chu Feng. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Although it was the first time Chu Feng had played Stone Gambling, he was capable of understanding what Song Yunfei meant by ‘compete with one another.’

Likely, the two of them would each choose a Black Crystal Stone, and then put forth a certain gambling stake to see whose Black Crystal Stone contained a greater amount of Immortal Martial Stones. The winner would be the person with the greatest amount of Immortal Martial Stones.

However, even the bystanders were thinking that Chu Feng had only managed his vast success through luck. However, Song Yunfei had declared that Chu Feng was proficient in examining Black Crystal Stones right away.

He was clearly deliberately making Chu Feng appear greater so that he could manifest his own greatness after defeating Chu Feng. He wanted everyone to know that Chu Feng was much inferior when compared to him.

Actually, Chu Feng had only cut open that Black Crystal Stone as a test. Thus, even Chu Feng himself felt that there was an aspect of luck to his success. If Chu Feng were tasked with cutting open another Black Crystal Stone, he would have no certainty of success at all.

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng could not cower before Song Yunfei.

Thus, Chu Feng said without any hesitation, “Of course. How do you want to gamble?”

“Ten thousand Immortal Martial Stones. Both you and I will choose a Black Crystal Stone. Their value cannot surpass a thousand Immortal Martial Stones. What say you?” Song Yunfei said.

“Ten thousand Immortal Martial Stones? Heavens! This... this... this is simply an enormous gamble!”

Upon hearing what Song Yunfei said, those gamblers were all stunned. In fact, even the Ghost Sect Hall’s elders revealed a change in their expressions, and gathered around.

After all, ten thousand Immortal Martial Stones was enough to purchase an ordinary Immortal Armament.

There was no need to mention how valuable Immortal Armaments were. For many powers, their wealth was even directly proportional to the amount of Immortal Armaments they possessed.

“If brother Chu Feng feels that the gambling stake is too high, we can lower it a bit. There is always room for discussion,” Song Yunfei said with a beaming smile.

His words were very mocking. He was mocking Chu Feng, and declaring that Chu Feng was unable to afford gambling with such high stakes.

Had it been before, Chu Feng would also think this gambling stake to be too high.

However now, humph, the amount of Immortal Martial Stones in Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack would likely be sufficient enough to scare Song Yunfei away, were he to know of them.

“There’s no need for that. This gambling stake will do,” Chu Feng answered without hesitation.

“Very well, brother Chu Feng is truly frank. It would appear that brother Chu Feng truly possesses the means to see through the Black Crystal Stones. Since that’s the case, let us begin.”

Song Yunfei was pleased beyond expectation after Chu Feng agreed to it. Even his eyes started to shine; even his heart became extremely excited.

He had previously suffered at Chu Feng’s hands. This was something that had caused him to be unable to sleep soundly ever since. From this, it could be seen how much Song Yunfei detested Chu Feng.

And now, he had finally found an opportunity to get revenge. Naturally, he would be excited.

Afterwards, Chu Feng and Song Yunfei both chose a Black Crystal Stone. As for their price, they were both priced at a thousand Immortal Martial Stones.

After they made their selection, their respective attending elders helped them cut open their Black Crystal Stones.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s state of mind was still decent. After all, he did not hold too enormous of a hope. He was merely testing things out still, testing to see if his observation method was effective. If it wasn’t effective, he would change things up.

After all, Chu Feng himself knew very well that luck had actually played a greater role in the first Black Crystal Stone he opened.

That said, while Chu Feng did not hold too enormous of a hope, the surrounding crowd members were filled with anticipation.

As the saying goes, the spectators did not fear the show becoming too grand. The surrounding crowd was precisely like this.

Furthermore, this was a showdown between two geniuses. Naturally, the crowd would be looking forward to it even more.

As the two elders continued to cut open the two Black Crystal Stones, the results started to become evident.

Song Yunfei’s Black Crystal Stone did not produce a lot of Immortal Martial Stones. It was only enough to recover the amount he had spent on it.

However, he still won against Chu Feng. The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s Black Crystal Stone was completely empty. It was actually a worthless lump of rock without any Immortal Martial Stones inside.

“Brother Chu Feng, it would appear that you’ve made an error in judgement this time around.”

Song Yunfei looked to Chu Feng with a mocking expression.

After winning against Chu Feng, he was nearly blooming with happiness.

In fact, he would even take occasional glances at Xia Yun’er, as if he was afraid that she wouldn’t know that he had won against Chu Feng.

Chu Feng remained very calm in the face of this result. He streaked his hand across his Cosmos Sack. Then, ten thousand Immortal Martial Stones were retrieved from his Cosmos Sack. Those Immortal Martial Stones started floating toward Song Yunfei.

“What... what a grand amount of wealth!”

Seeing the Immortal Martial Stones, the gamblers’ eyes all started shining. Chu Feng actually handed over ten thousand Immortal Martial Stones without the slightest amount of hesitation. This sort of boldness was something that they would never possess in their entire lives.
