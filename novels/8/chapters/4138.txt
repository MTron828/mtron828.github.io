Chapter 4138 - Immortal Taboo Vs. Exalted Taboo

“You!”

Zuoqiu Daoyi raised his head and looked at Chu Feng.

Shock filled his face.

Even though he had witnessed Chu Feng’s strength from outside the formation, he had still felt it to be very unbelievable when he experienced it for himself.

“What are you doing? Self-harm?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.

“You are truly arrogant.”

“Did you really think that I was only a rank three Utmost Exalted?”

As Zuoqiu Daoyi spoke, his Lightning Mark appeared on his forehead.

Whilst it was only a Heaven-level Lightning Mark, it had still managed to increase his cultivation.

Once Zuoqiu Daoyi’s cultivation increased to rank four Utmost Exalted, he abruptly waved his arm and slashed it straight at Chu Feng’s neck.

He intended to hack Chu Feng’s neck in two with his arm.

“Clank~~~”

However, after his arm shot out a metallic collision sound was heard.

When the crowd saw the result of his attack their expressions changed again.

“This guy.”

Even the girl from the Dragon Clan sitting above the clouds stood up all of a sudden.

Disbelief filled her eyes.

The old man from the Dragon Clan that stood behind her had the same expression on his face.

He was so shocked that his mouth was slightly agape.

“You... you... exactly what sort of monster are you?”

Zuoqiu Daoyi took multiple steps back. He did not dare to believe the scene before him.

Earlier, his arm had successfully struck Chu Feng’s neck, just like his palm strike had thrust toward Chu Feng’s dantian before.

Yet, Chu Feng’s neck, like his dantian, was completely undamaged.

It was instead Zuoqiu Daoyi’s arm that was snapped in half.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s cultivation had actually increased again.

Chu Feng’s current cultivation was no longer that of a rank three Utmost Exalted. Instead It had increased to rank four Utmost Exalted.

There were four types of gaseous flames surging through his body.

It was precisely those four gaseous flames that had increased his cultivation again.

However, everyone could tell that it was not a Heavenly Bloodline.

Instead, it was Divine Power!

“Exactly who is this Chu Feng?”

“Isn’t he a Heavenly Bloodline possessor? How could he have Divine Power too?”

Many Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen grew terrified of Chu Feng.

Even Zuoqiu Tiancheng, who had been tortured so severely by Chu Feng that he was unable to even stand up, had a look of shock and horror on his face.

It was common knowledge that Heavenly Bloodlines and Divine Powers were two different sorts of powers.

Those who possessed Heavenly Bloodlines would not be able to possess Divine Power.

The same held true the other way around.

Yet, before their eyes the youngster who had trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique had actually unleashed a Divine Power.

Not only were there four different sorts of gaseous flames surging through his body, but the sky above was also covered in golden clouds, amidst which roars from four different beasts could also be faintly heard.

Abnormal sign. That was a Divine Power that could trigger an abnormal sign just from being released.

“Do you know why I’m arrogant now?” Chu Feng said to Zuoqiu Daoyi. Ridicule filled his voice.

“You...”

Zuoqiu Daoyi gnashed his teeth. He was unable to refute Chu Feng.

He had been defeated, thoroughly defeated. Under the same cultivation, there was an enormous disparity between his battle power and Chu Feng’s.

If he relied only on his own strength he simply wouldn’t be a match for Chu Feng.

However, Zuoqiu Daoyi would not admit defeat. After all, he still had a trump card up his sleeve.

Even though it was something that he was unwilling to bring out, that trump card became the only chance for him to turn the situation around.

“The show’s only just starting!”

Zuoqiu Daoyi moved his hand to his Cosmos Sack and took out a stone. The stone emitted a similar aura to the ones that made up the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation. However, they were not the same.

The stone was emitting a glimmer, and a medicinal aroma.

Zuoqiu Daoyi immediately placed the stone into his mouth.

“Buzz~~~”

Once the stone entered his body, Zuoqiu Daoyi’s body began emitting light.

The aura of the light was actually identical to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formations.

Zuoqiu Daoyi then attacked again.

He sent forth a punch explosively. That punch was aimed at Chu Feng’s face.

Even though the punch also did not contain any special techniques, was not a martial skill or an Immortal Technique, its speed and power had increased enormously compared to his previous attack.

Chu Feng realized the change to Zuoqiu Daoyi’s punch. Even he did not dare to be careless.

That said, Chu Feng was not afraid either. He met the incoming punch with his own.

Chu Feng’s punch was not aimed at Zuoqiu Daoyi’s face. It was also not aimed at his dantian.

Instead, Chu Feng’s fist shot toward Zuoqiu Daoyi’s incoming fist.

“Facing me head-on?”

“As you wish.”

Realizing Chu Feng’s intention, Zuoqiu Daoyi became even more excited.

“Bang~~~”

Finally, the two fists collided.

An enormous force resulted from the collision.

Zuoqiu Daoyi found himself unable to withstand the impact, and took several steps back before barely stabilizing himself.

Upon stabilizing himself, Zuoqiu Daoyi revealed a look of joy.

It turned out that he was not the only one that had been forced back by the impact of their fists.

Even Chu Feng had been forced back by the impact.

The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen all felt extremely excited upon seeing this scene.

This meant that Zuoqiu Daoyi’s strength was on par with Chu Feng’s.

There was still hope for this battle.

The outcome was still undecided.

“Clank~~~”

Suddenly, a flash of light swept out. A sword had appeared in Zuoqiu Daoyi’s hand.

It was an incomplete Exalted Armament.

Seeing this, Chu Feng flicked his wrist and also revealed an Incomplete Exalted Armament.

“He’s actually planning to compete in swordplay?”

“Although this Chu Feng’s battle power is overwhelming, he’ll be overestimating his capabilities if he wants to compete with young master Daoyi in swordplay.”

Seeing that the Incomplete Exalted Armament Chu Feng took out was also a sword, many Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen began to sneer at Chu Feng in delight.

It was as if Chu Feng had fallen into a trap.

The reason for that was because they knew that Zuoqiu Daoyi loved swords.

Throughout his entire life he had chosen swords as his weapon in all levels of weaponry.

Even if other weapons were of higher quality he would still refuse them.

Because of his love for swords, he had studied sword techniques meticulously, and had achieved a superlative level of swordsmanship.

Even if he did not use any martial skills or Immortal Techniques, his swordsmanship was already at a level akin to perfection.

Whilst Chu Feng was able to tie with Zuoqiu Daoyi in kicks and punches, they felt that he would only be seeking his own humiliation by competing with Zuoqiu Daoyi in terms of swordsmanship.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

At that moment, Chu Feng and Zuoqiy Daoyi unleashed their attacks at the same time and collided in battle.

Even though they were fixed in place, those with weaker cultivations were no longer able to catch sight of them.

Countless sword silhouettes covered the radius of their battle.

However, the battle did not last long. Soon, a figure flew out from the battlefield filled with sword silhouettes.

It was Zuoqiu Daoyi.

When they looked over, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen simply did not dare believe their eyes.

Zuoqiu Daoyi’s body was actually covered in wounds.

One of his arms has been severed as well.

Looking over at Chu Feng, they discovered that he was completely uninjured.

“Young master Daoyi actually lost in a battle of swords?”

The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen began feeling very unsettled.

After all, swordsmanship was Zuoqiu Daoyi’s expertise.

It would be one thing if he were defeated in something he was unfamiliar with.

However, to be defeated in his greatest expertise inevitably caused the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen to feel despair.

“It’s about time to end this,” said Zuoqiu Daoyi. His words surprised the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.

Black lightning then shot out of Zuoqiu Daoyi’s body.

The black lightning then assimilated with the Incomplete Exalted Armament he held in his hand.

After the Incomplete Exalted Armament was covered by black lightning it became even more dangerous.

A look of seriousness appeared in Chu Feng’s eyes after he saw the black lightning. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

If his guess was correct, that was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

After seeing the situation change, Chu Feng also unleashed his attack.

“Rumble~~~”

Thunder roared as a vast amount of black clouds appeared in the sky above Chu Feng.

Blood-red lightning was present in the black clouds.

The sight of the lightning clouds appeared much more terrifying than Zuoqiu Daoyi’s black lightning-infused sword.

“Has Chu Feng gone mad?”

However, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were all stupefied when they saw Chu Feng’s martial skill.

They all knew very well what sort of ability the black lightning Zuoqiu Daoyi used was.

Indeed, it was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill. Although it was only a rank one Exalted Taboo, it still possessed extremely formidable power.

As for the martial skill that Chu Feng had used, even though it appeared even more terrifying, there was a vast disparity in its might.

They could tell that the martial skill Chu Feng had used was an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill.

To fight an Exalted Taboo with an Immortal Taboo.

It was simply equivalent to a Martial Immortal fighting an Utmost Exalted.

They were of two completely different tiers. How could one possibly contend against a tier stronger than oneself?

If this wasn’t an act of insanity, what else could it be?

“Chu Feng, what is the meaning of this?”

“Are you trying to die, or are you looking down on me?”

Compared to the other Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen, Zuoqiu Daoyi’s expression was even uglier.

He felt that Chu Feng’s action was an enormous act of humiliation.

“Don’t misunderstand. I’m not looking down on you.”

“It’s just that I feel that my Immortal Taboo is sufficient to take on that Exalted Taboo of yours,” said Chu Feng.
