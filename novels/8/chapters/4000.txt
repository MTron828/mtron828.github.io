Chapter 4000 - Look Of Contempt

“It would appear that that guy is still here.”

Worry disappeared from the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master’s face, and was replaced with exceptional excitement.

“Still here?”

The leaders of the other five major powers asked at the same time.

Even though they’d all released their martial power to sense their surroundings, they were unable to detect Chu Feng’s aura at all.

Because of that, they were very worried that Chu Feng would be able to escape.

“He’s here.”

As the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master spoke, he tugged at the air.

“Ling, ling, ling~~~”

The bell sounded again. A red thread actually appeared in his hand.

There were bells hanging from that red thread, spaced a foot apart.

Once the red thread appeared, it quickly extended with the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master’s palm as the starting point.

In the blink of an eye, countless red threads appeared before the crowd’s line of sight.

Those red threads were tangled and complicated. Together, they formed a giant cage.

The red threads completely sealed off the entire vast plaza.

This was actually a formation that the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master had set up a long time ago. Merely, it had only revealed itself at that moment.

“Ling, ling, ling~~~”

As the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master pulled on the red thread, ringing bells sounded through heaven and earth.

Soon, a distorted figure appeared at the center of the plaza.

That person was naturally Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was standing near a spirit formation gate.

Everyone could tell that he had just walked out from the spirit formation gate.

Actually, Chu Feng had managed to pull a blindfold over everyone’s eyes by concealing himself with the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

Unfortunately, he was unable to escape the detection of the formation set up by the treasure of the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master.

Even though Chu Feng was not fully revealed, the strange sound waves still managed to capture his silhouette.

The distorted figure displayed by the sound waves was precisely where Chu Feng stood.

“Amazing. As expected of the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion protection treasure.”

“If we didn’t have this treasure, that bastard would’ve really escaped.”

Many people were exclaiming in admiration repeatedly. They were also rejoicing.

They were in awe of how powerful the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master’s treasure was.

That said, they were also gasping in awe at how powerful Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were.

If it wasn’t for that treasure, a single person of the younger generation would’ve been able to escape without a trace before the six great powers’ leaders. If this were to spread, oh how ridiculous it would be.

“Little bastard, let’s see where you’re going to escape to now.”

At practically the moment Chu Feng appeared, attacks were sent towards him.

There were actually two people that attacked him.

Apart from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster, the other person was actually the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster.

Actually, in terms of feeling hatred towards Chu Feng, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s secmaster would be the person who held the greatest hatred for Chu Feng besides the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

Earlier, with the identity of Wang Chen, Chu Feng had made an overwhelming display of himself in the stone case world, and was completely unrivaled.

At that time, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster had been overjoyed. He had felt that the appearance of such a demon-level genius in his Wind Lightning Sword Sect meant that his sect would be able to overwhelm all the other major powers soon.

He had even imagined the future where their Wind Lightning Sword Sect would rise in power under the leadership of Wang Chen.

Earlier, he had also fully expressed how proud and pleased he was with Wang Chen before the crowd.

However, in the end, he had discovered that Wang Chen was actually an outsider in disguise.

Furthermore, the actual Wang Chen was a total disgrace of a disciple. He had even publicly announced how he had tried to kill his fellow disciple.

At that moment, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster had truly wanted to find a hole in the wall to hide himself in.

He truly felt that he had been too humiliated to continue to stay there.

As for all of that, it was all because of Chu Feng.

As such, it was only natural that he would possess endless hatred for Chu Feng.

“Boom~~~”

Two waves of oppressive might exploded forth at the same time, and rushed straight towards Chu Feng.

However, before that oppressive might could even approach him, they actually collided.

“Why are you stopping me?”

The Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster turned to the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster furiously.

The reason for that was because it was the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster who had used his oppressive might to stop the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster’s oppressive might. That was the reason why their oppressive mights had collided before reaching Chu Feng.

“With how fierce your oppressive might is, are you trying to kill him?”

“If you kill him and we end up being unable to find the treasures from the stone case, are you going to compensate us for it?”

The Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster spoke with great annoyance.

The reason why he was so annoyed was precisely as he had stated.

He only cared about the mysterious treasure Chu Feng had obtained from the stone case.

At that moment, no one knew what the mysterious treasure was.

Furthermore, no one knew where the mysterious treasure was.

Chu Feng was the only one that knew about it.

Earlier, the oppressive might that had been unleashed by the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster was simply fatal. He was trying to take Chu Feng’s life.

As such, it was only natural that the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster would have to stop him.

After all, if Chu Feng were to die and they ended up being unable to find the mysterious treasure, they’d have suffered enormous losses.

“Boom~~~”

Right at that moment, heaven and earth started to tremble violently.

Many people with low levels of cultivation were overturned by the trembling.

Whilst the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster were arguing, someone else had rushed to attack Chu Feng.

They were the Inferno Academy’s headmaster and the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

However, when their oppressive mights approached Chu Feng, they reacted as if they’d entered a bottomless pit. Not only were their oppressive mights unable to harm Chu Feng, but the surroundings even started to quake strangely.

“Remove your Monster Suppression Immortal Bell Formation!!!” the Inferno Academy’s headmaster shouted upon seeing that they were unable to capture Chu Feng.

As for that Monster Suppression Immortal Bell Formation, it was naturally the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master’s treasure that had detected the hidden Chu Feng.

“It’s not an issue with my treasure. My treasure will not keep you all from capturing him.”

After the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master said those words, he wanted to prove that he had not deceived them, and decided to personally capture Chu Feng.

He extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. His oppressive might turned into a palm that rushed straight towards Chu Feng.

However, like the Inferno Academy’s headmaster and the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, his oppressive might was devoured by an incorporeal power when it approached Chu Feng.

“Boom~~~”

Then, heaven and earth started trembling. There were even people of the younger generation with weak cultivations that ended up bleeding from their seven facial orifices and falling unconscious due to the trembling.

It was as if the oppressive might unleashed by the Inferno Academy’s headmaster was absorbed and then released. In a different form, that released oppressive might covered heaven and earth.

“Humph.”

Suddenly, a figure left the main viewing platform.

When that person appeared again, he was standing before Chu Feng.

It was the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster extended his hand and grabbed directly at Chu Feng.

Even though he did not unleash his overwhelming oppressive might, his grab was still equally powerful.

It was as if his palm had covered the sky, and no one could escape from his grasp.

That was the might of a grand existence, the strongest expert in the All-heaven Starfield.

“How could this be?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, when his hand was about ten meters away from Chu Feng, he found that he was actually unable to move forward.

It was as if there was a soft wall before him, blocking him.

Then, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster, Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and Inferno Academy’s headmaster all rushed forth.

Their movements were equally impressive. Even the color of the sky had changed.

Yet, like the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster, they were all stopped at a distance of ten meters from Chu Feng.

“Damn it! Remove your bells!” the Inferno Academy’s headmaster shouted angrily.

“I told you that this has nothing to do with me.” The Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master felt very helpless.

However, he still removed the bells that covered the entire sky.

However, even after the bells had disappeared, the four of them were still in the same posture as before.

They all had their hands outstretched, trying to grab Chu Feng.

Furthermore, from their expressions, one could tell that they were having a very difficult time and trying very hard to move forward.

Unfortunately, no matter how hard they tried, they were unable to reach Chu Feng at all.

The reason for that was because both their physical bodies and their oppressive mights had been blocked.

The only difference from earlier was that, due to the Demon Suppression Immortal Bell Formation, Chu Feng’s silhouette, although distorted, could still be seen.

Now that the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master had undone his treasure’s power, Chu Feng’s silhouette had also disappeared.

“Heh, a bunch of trash.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s voice was heard.

At the same time, his figure reappeared.

Merely, this time around, his figure was no longer distorted.

Everyone knew that Chu Feng had decided to reveal himself.

However, facing the leaders of the six major powers attacking him from all directions, Chu Feng showed no trace of fear. Instead, he had a look of contempt and ridicule on his face.

“You damned bastard!”

“I’ll kill you!!!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.

It was the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster.

He’d already harbored hatred for Chu Feng. With Chu Feng, taunting him in such a meaner, he utterly exploded with rage.

His anger and killing intent could be felt by everyone present.

Even the sky changed. Lightning and thunder filled the sky.

However, although he was extremely furious, he was still unable to breach the invisible barrier blocking him.
