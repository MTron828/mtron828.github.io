Chapter 3629 - Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword

“Lord Shoujian, that sword must possess some sort of origin, right?” Someone asked curiously.

“That sword does possess quite an origin. The sword is called the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.”

“Look carefully. The body of that sword is not forged from steel. Instead, it is composed of a block of polished jade,” Lord Shoujian said as he pointed to the red sword.

“That seems to be true. It is truly unimaginable. A block of jade is actually able to be polished into an Incomplete Exalted Armament of such excellent quality?”

“That is most definitely no ordinary jade. It is most definitely a rare precious treasure.”

The crowd were all focused on that sword. After verifying that the sword was indeed composed of jade, the crowd felt even greater envy toward Yin Zhuanghong.

“The person who forged the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword was a world spiritist whose name shook the entire Holy Light Galaxy. Due to his eccentric nature and his life-long indulgence in studying the dao of weaponry forging, everyone addressed him as the Swordforge Madman.”

“Because of his personality, Swordforge Madman hardly had any dealings with others. He would even keep the weapons he forged, and never gift or sell them to anyone.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“However, one day, he suddenly fell in love with a woman. Because of that, he took out two valuable treasures that he had kept for a long time and prepared to use them to forge weapons to gift to that woman.”

“The two treasures he had kept were two divine jades that fell from the heavens. They were items that the Swordforge Madman spent a great amount of wealth to obtain.”

“However, even though they were both jades that descended from the heavens and superb crafting materials, they were different from each other. One was blue, and the other was red.”

“Because of that, he forged two weapons, a blue sword and a red sword.”

“The Swordforge Madman named the two swords the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword and Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.”

“He kept the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword with him, and planned to gift the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword to the woman he had fallen in love with.”

“Unfortunately, before he could gift the sword to her, the woman died. Because of that woman’s death, the Swordforge Madman became depressed, and ended up dying.”

“Before his death, he destroyed all the weapons he had forged in his life. Only the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword and the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword were spared from his destruction.”

“Some people said that the reason why those two swords were not destroyed was because they contained his love and longing for that woman. Because of that, he was reluctant to destroy them.”

“However, regardless of what it might be, the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword and Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword were the only two weapons that remained from all the weapons the Swordforge Madman had forged in his life,” said Lord Shoujian.

“In that case, doesn’t it mean that the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword and the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword are a pair?”

“They’re lovers’ swords?” Someone asked.

Lord Shoujian smiled. That gentle smile of his presented his answer to the crowd. Then, he said, “Truth be told, the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword is actually also in the Divine Armament Cemetery.”

“Truly?”

The crowd all became excited upon hearing those words. At the same time, they revealed looks of anticipation.

The crowd were all able to tell that Yin Zhuanghong was very fond of her Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.

If anyone could obtain the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword, they would be able to use the other sword of Yin Zhuanghong’s lover’s sword. That was simply a man’s lifelong dream.

Not to mention the others, even Nangong Yifan had a strong look of expectation in his eyes.

“When is the earliest time for the Divine Armament Cemetery to open again?” Nangong Yifan asked Lord Shoujian.

Everyone understood his intentions by asking that question. He was in a rush to enter the Divine Armament Cemetery again with the hope of finding the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.

“That’s hard to tell. At the earliest, it will take three years. Should it take a long time, it is possible to take a dozen years, or even a few decades,” said Lord Shoujian.

Hearing those words, Nangong Yifan’s expectation-filled gaze dimmed a lot.

The Divine Armament Cemetery would never show any sign of its opening. After it opened, it would close after a short period of time.

Unless one were to wait there until it opened again, it would be very difficult to be the first one to enter the Divine Armament Cemetery.

However, the opening was so unfixed. Even if he wanted to wait, the power behind him would not agree to it.

Even though he felt very unwilling, he had no choice but to give up on the thought of obtaining the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.

“Brother Chu Feng, let’s see what sort of weapon that blade of yours is,” Kong Tianhui said to Chu Feng.

Even though Kong Tianhui spoke very loudly, no one bothered to look toward Chu Feng.

They simply did not care about what sort of weapon the blackiron blade Chu Feng held in his hand was, as their gazes were still caught by Yin Zhuanghong’s Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.

“Very well, I’ll check it out.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he shook his arm, and the blade he held in his hand started to tremble violently. The black iron that covered the blade started to shatter and fall away from the blade.

Suddenly, a miraculous power was released from the blade in Chu Feng’s hand.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword Yin Zhaunghong held in her hand rose upward, and pointed at Chu Feng.

Following that, the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword actually began to move toward Chu Feng. Even though Yin Zhuanghong was holding tightly onto her sword, she was unable to stop it.

Soon, the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword collided with the blade Chu Feng held in his hand. As for Yin Zhanghong, she was pulled all the way to Chu Feng by her Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.

“Shameless bastard, what are you doing?!”

The people of the younger generation from the All-heaven Starfield were furious upon seeing that. They thought that Chu Feng had done something to forcibly pull Yin Zhuanghong to his side.

“It’s that blade!!!” said Lord Shoujian.

“It really is that blade.”

Upon hearing Lord Shoujian, the crowd noticed that Chu Feng did not use any sort of trick at all. Instead, it was the blade Chu Feng held in his hand. That blade was emitting a suction power.

That suction power was very strange. It did not affect any of the people or items in the surroundings.

However, it just so happened to unleash an enormous suction power upon the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword Yin Zhuanghong held in her hand.

That suction power was so strong that not even Yin Zhuanghong was able to stop it.

“What is going on?”

Not to mention the others, even Chu Feng was staring at the blade and sword before him with a confused look on his face.

“Clamor~~~”

Suddenly, the blade Chu Feng held in his hand started to emit a bright light and the remaining blackiron fell off.

When the light dissipated, the crowd were shocked to discover that the weapon Chu Feng held in his hand was not a blade at all. Instead, it was a sword.

That sword looked identical to the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword Yin Zhuanghong held in her hand.

The only difference was that Chu Feng’s sword was blue.

“The hell?! That couldn’t possibly be the legendary Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword, right?!” Someone blurted out in shock.
