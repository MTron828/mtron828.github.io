Chapter 5811: If I Can Cripple You Once, I Can Cripple You Twice

Chapter 5811: If I Can Cripple You Once, I Can Cripple You Twice

Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai were scared beyond words, whereas Jiang Taibai’s face turned completely pale. Even Jiang Jingyu was in a state of panic.

Qin Xuan? Long Chengyu? Long Muxi? Yuwen Yanri? Xianhai Shaoyu? Xianhai Yu’er? Ling Xiao? Jie Baobao?

Jiang Jingyu couldn’t believe these renowned prodigies would appear together with Chu Feng. He had heard about Chu Feng, as Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai had told him about their loss to Chu Feng. However, he wasn’t bothered by it, and he thought that Chu Feng was simply a talented junior.

Why would Chu Feng be together with the most talented prodigies in the world of cultivation?

“Fakes! You are all fakes! Long Chengyu and Long Muxi are dead! The two of them would have been imprisoned even if they were alive. There’s no way those two could have been here. You’re putting on an act to deceive me. You must take me, Jia Lingyi, for a fool!” Jia Lingyi sneered.

Despite her loud voice, she couldn’t conceal her fluster. She was panicking because she couldn’t find any gaps in their appearances. These renowned prodigies looked to be the real deal in her eyes.

“Noisy!” Xianhai Shaoyu sneered. He released his oppressive might as a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, which crushed Jia Lingyi onto the ground in an instant.

“Rank seven Half-God level? And that’s his base cultivation... He really is Xianhai Shaoyu, the strongest junior in the world of cultivation!” Jiang Jingyu said with a fearful voice.

Jia Lingyi, as an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, possessed strength comparable to that of a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, but she stood no chance against Xianhai Shaoyu at all. This was due to the massive gap in their fighting prowess.

This massive gap in their fighting prowess was enough to prove Xianhai Shaoyu’s identity, as no other junior could have been this powerful. This inadvertently proved that the other prodigies were the real deal, as Xianhai Shaoyu wouldn’t have participated in a farce.

The people before them were the most talented individuals throughout the world of cultivation.

“Y-you went to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith?” Jia Lingyi asked Chu Feng.

She belatedly realized that Chu Feng must have become acquainted with Xianhai Shaoyu and the others in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“You finally realized it?” Xianhai Shaoyu looked at Jia Lingyi with a sneer. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Young master Xianhai, why is someone of your stature working with Chu Feng? Young master Ling and young miss Jie, you must have heard about what Chu Feng did in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!” Jia Lingyi spoke with an incomparably humble voice.

She dared not to pull her weight before these prodigies, as she knew she was nothing compared to these people.

“Why? Let me tell you why.”

Qin Xuan stood forward and glanced at Jia Lingyi, Jiang Jingyu, Jiang Taibai, Jiang Yuantai, and Jiang Kongping before finally turning to Chu Feng. He opened his arm wide and said, “Allow me to introduce him to you. He, Chu Feng, is from the Eastern Region’s Ancestral Martial Galaxy. His mother is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Lord Jie Ranqing.”

“What?” Jiang Jingyu and the others were astounded.

There was no world spiritist in the world of cultivation who hadn’t heard about Jie Ranqing, and Chu Feng was Jie Ranqing’s child?!

Qin Xuan paid no heed to their response. He turned to Jia Lingyi and said, “Chu Feng possesses the Ruler’s Bloodline too, and he also possesses a Heavenly Lightning Bloodline of at least Saint-tier and above.”

“Ruler’s Bloodline?” Jiang Taibai and the others looked at Chu Feng with conflicted eyes.

“Also, he defeated the juniors from the Ancient Era, conquered the Genesis Bloodline, and became titled the strongest junior in the world of cultivation. Jia Lingyi, do you understand why now?” Qin Xuan said.

Jia Lingyi didn’t reply. She struggled to come to terms with what she had just heard. She knew that Chu Feng could have gone to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, but she couldn’t believe that he had actually clinched the title of the strongest.

This would mean that prodigies of the likes of Qin Xuan, Ling Xiao, Yuwen Yanri, and Xianhai Shaoyu actually lost to him! But how could that be possible? No matter how talented Chu Feng was, there was no way he could grow that quickly!

But the fact none of the prodigies refuted Qin Xuan’s words was the best proof this was real.

Qin Xuan looked at the dazed Jia Lingyi and continued on, “If you still don’t get it, I’ll put it out even clearer for you. We’re now together with Chu Feng. Is that simple enough to grasp?”

Jiang Jingyu and the others felt goosebumps all over their arms, and they fell into a daze. Jia Lingyi collapsed to the ground, looking as if someone had robbed her of all energy.

Qin Xuan turned around, walked behind Chu Feng, and stood with an upright posture as if a sidekick. Wang Qiang and Long Chengyu directed a thumbs up at Qin Xuan, to which the latter responded with a gleeful clasp of his fist. He looked proud of what he had just done.

Chu Feng turned to Qin Xuan and asked, “Brother Qin, aren’t you afraid that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion might come after you?”

“What do I have to fear? No one trusts the words of the likes of her. Besides, does she even dare to run her mouth? I’m not scared even if you don’t kill her.” Qin Xuan even turned to Ling Xiao and asked, “Ling Xiao, are you afraid?”

“Of course not,” Ling Xiao replied in disdain.

Qin Xuan turned to Yuwen Yanri and asked, “Yuwen Yanri, are you afraid?”

Yuwen Yanri shook his head.

People of their standing wouldn’t fear the likes of Jia Lingyi, which was why they dared to reveal their backgrounds and identities before her. They never thought of her as a threat from the start to the end. If Jia Lingyi dared to run her mouth, she would be the only one who would suffer.

Chu Feng understood that. He turned to Xianhai Shaoyu and said, “Brother Shaoyu, let her go.”

Xianhai Shaoyu retracted his oppressive might.

Chu Feng walked up to Jia Lingyi and tore away her mask, revealing her ugly face. His action enraged Jia Lingyi. Knowing that she was cornered, she charged at Chu Feng with a mad dog.

“I’ll slaughter...” Jia Lingyi froze up before she could finish her words.

Chu Feng had dodged her attack and instead plunged his hand into her dantian.

“Jia Lingyi, if I can cripple you once, I can cripple you a second time,” Chu Feng said.

Jia Lingyi howled in agony. She could feel her cultivation quickly receding. On top of that, Chu Feng was absorbing her origin energies. She soon lost her energy and collapsed to the ground like a dead dog.

Once again, she had been reduced to a cripple.

Chu Feng held a transparent bead harnessing incredible energy. He had retrieved it from her body. “Is this the reason you were able to regain your cultivation?”
