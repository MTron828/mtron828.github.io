Chapter 5939: The White-haired Youth in the Crystal

Chu Feng took another look at the map and saw that he was now quite close to where he was to steal the red bottle. Song Yun had intentionally brought him in this direction, suggesting that she intended to have him help her from the moment they met.

Even so, he didn’t think much about it.

Putting aside their past ties, he understood that this was just a cooperation. They were just taking what they needed from each other. Song Yun would help him find Little Fishy, while he would help her acquire the red bottle.

Following the map, he arrived at a forest.

The forest was a feint; there was a massive underground chamber beneath it. It was no easy feat to find the underground chamber. Even with Chu Feng’s sharp discernment, it would have still taken him some effort to find it.

Fortunately, Song Yun had made preparations in advance. She had given him a Cosmos Sack filled with treasures to deal with the underground chamber.

Thanks to those treasures, he easily found the underground chamber’s entrance.

There was a large group of Netherworld Sectmembers at the underground chamber’s entrance. They were of a different caliber compared to the trash he had met earlier.

It wouldn’t have been easy for Chu Feng to deal with him under normal circumstances, but Song Yun had prepared concealment means that allowed him to slip into the underground chamber with ease.

According to Song Yun, this underground chamber was where the new faction’s upper echelons resided. Ordinary sectmembers were forbidden from entering. Now that the upper echelons had left to attend a meeting, there was no one inside.

The underground chamber was intentionally built like a labyrinth, but Chu Feng easily navigated the place thanks to the map. He soon arrived at the hall indicated on the map. The doors of the hall were shut, but Song Yun prepared a spirit formation key.

Chu Feng was able to enter the hall without a hitch thanks to the spirit formation key.

There was a blood-red pool inside the hall, and it was furiously boiling. Floating at the center of the blood-red pool was a massive, transparent crystal. A young man lay inside the crystal.

This young man was around two meters tall. He had a dashing face and a skinny body, though that seemed to be his natural physique rather than the result of an illness. His hair was white, and he was dressed in the Netherworld Sect’s red robe.

The young man was unconscious for some reason, but he was still breathing. This blood-red pool was a formation, and it was nourishing the young man.

The crystal was a treasure with tremendous defensive prowess. It was beyond Chu Feng’s means to shatter.

It was fortunate Song Yun only needed the red bottle and not the crystal, or else Chu Feng would have been at a loss.

The red bottle was placed in a conspicuous position in the hall. It must have been important to the new faction, for it was sealed off by a formation. Chu Feng would have needed some time to breach this formation, but the process was made easy by Song Yun’s treasures.

Song Yun was extremely thorough in her preparations, such that she was likely to have succeeded even if she did it on her own.

Chu Feng obtained the red bottle without a hitch. He examined the bottle and saw that it contained a Netherworld Embryo, but this Netherworld Embryo was mutated. The talismans plastered around the bottle served to seal it off.

All in all, the bottle felt dangerous to Chu Feng.

“Does Song Yun intend to use this terrifying thing for her cultivation?”

Chu Feng thought that it would be dangerous to mess with this item, but he still stowed the bottle away since Song Yun needed it.

With his job done, he began making his way out of the underground chamber.

However, he quickly realized that this hall wasn’t the end of the underground chamber. There was something special about this place, or at least, the people who stayed here were definitely of lofty standing in the Netherworld Sect.

Chu Feng wondered if there might be clues here.

While Song Yun was gathering information about Little Fishy’s whereabouts for him, there was always the chance that she failed. Since Chu Feng was in their base, he figured that he should do some scouting of his own.

Unfortunately, most of the places in the underground chamber had been sealed off. It would be impossible to access those places without the corresponding treasures.

Song Yun had only prepared treasures to access the hall; they wouldn’t work on other places. Thus, Chu Feng had no choice but to leave the underground chamber.

Shortly after he left the underground chamber, he suddenly halted his footsteps, reached into his Cosmos Sack, and took out a compass. This was the compass he had acquired from killing the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven.

The Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven had previously used this compass to track him, and now, the compass was reacting.

“Is someone from the Immortal Slaughterer here?”

With such a thought in mind, Chu Feng headed in the direction pointed out by the compass.

Soon, he encountered two old men flying in his direction. They were likely heading toward the underground chamber. Both were dressed in the Netherworld Sect’s red robes, but they didn’t wear the white bamboo hat. It was as if they were intentionally revealing their faces.

The two old men were ugly, but their eyes were twisted with savagery. They also did not attempt to conceal their auras—one was at rank Seven Half-God level, whereas the other was at rank eight Half-God level.

Thus, Chu Feng disguised himself as one of the Netherworld Sectmembers. He first headed a distance away and removed his concealment before flying toward the two old men once more, acting as if they had just bumped into each other.

With a cold, commanding voice, he called out, “You two from Immortal Slaughterer.”

Those two old men quickly halted their footsteps and bowed to Chu Feng. “Paying respect to milord.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

That verified that they were indeed from Immortal Slaughterer.
