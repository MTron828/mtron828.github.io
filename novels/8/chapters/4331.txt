Chapter 4331: Real Means

“This...”

Upon hearing those words from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, the complexion of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief darkened.

He never thought that the other party would actually renege on his words.

“Grandmaster, didn’t we already agree earlier to have Mumu accompany young friend Chu Feng?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Lord Clan Chief, my disciple has already said what that needs to be said. He’s entering the Dragon Vein Source not to fool around or to obtain a fortuitous encounter for an offspring of your Dragon Clan. He’s here to open up the Dragon Vein Source.

“Given how important his mission is, isn’t it only natural that he would want a reliable helper to fall back on?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“You old thing, are you saying that I’m unreliable? How am I inferior to Long Xiaoxiao? The two of you should know your place! You’re just servants working for our Dragon Clan, we’re your masters here! You should be listening to our orders, not telling us what to do!” Long Mumu berated furiously.

“Servants? Masters?”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist narrowed his eyes before turning to look at the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. With a derisive snort, he uttered coldly, “So, in the eyes of the Dragon Clan, my disciple and I are nothing more than servants?”

“No, that’s definitely not the case! Grandmaster, please don’t misunderstand!” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief hurriedly denied the matter.

Then, he turned to Long Mumu and reprimanded, “What kind of rubbish are you talking? This Grandmaster here is an esteemed guest our clan was specially invited over to aid us! How can he possibly be our servant? Hurry up and apologize to the Grandmaster!”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had a look of seething fury on his face as he bellowed at Long Mumu. It was a side of him he had never shown to the latter before.

Long Mumu was taken aback and frightened by the attitude of her father. She felt so wronged that she actually burst out crying.

Yet, the tearstained face of Long Mumu couldn’t soften the heart of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. Instead, his voice grew even louder and more imposing as he bellowed, “What are you bawling for? Apologize to the Grandmaster now!”

“I was wrong, Grandmaster. Please forgive me!”

Left with no choice, Long Mumu could only comply and apologize to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist simply chuckled to himself, not responding to her at all. He looked at the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and said, “Lord Clan Chief, this window of opportunity won’t last long. Are you still going to think about it?”

“Grandmaster, please wait a moment. I’ll be right back.”

After saying those words, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief quickly left the area.

As for where the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief went to, in truth, everyone already had the answer in their hearts. Between the fate of the Dragon Clan and Long Mumu, it was already clear which one he had chosen from the moment he berated her.

After the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief left, Long Mumu shot a grudging look at Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Even though she didn’t say anything, it was clear as day to everyone present that she carried a deep hatred for them.

A fortuitous encounter was already within her grasp, but it was taken away from her just like that.

And that wasn’t all she had lost. She had lost her dignity too.

“Grandmaster, you are a formidable individual,” Long Mumu’s mother suddenly spoke up at this moment.

“Madam, may I ask what do you mean by that?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“I can see that you are a person of great means, but opening the Dragon Vein Source is a very dangerous task. I wish for you to stay safe, Grandmaster.”

After Long Mumu’s mother said those words, the two of them began to take their leave.

Long Xiaoxiao was going to arrive very soon, and the two of them simply weren’t interested in seeing the smug look Long Xiaoxiao would have on her face.

While those appeared to be words of concern for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, everyone present could tell that she was actually threatening him.

So, right before they were about to leave the area, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke up, “Madam, you need not worry. As the saying goes, ‘Don’t try to mend porcelain wares if you don’t have a metal pick with you’. Since I have taken on this task, it goes without saying that I have my own means to get things done.”

“Is that so? Then I wish for the two of you to have a safe journey!” Long Mumu’s mother sneered coldly before leaving the area.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already vanished from the desert.

With their departure, the world suddenly seemed much more peaceful. The tense atmosphere that felt as if a fight could break out at any moment vanished without a trace.

“Chu Feng, come over. There are some things I need to talk to you about.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist called Chu Feng to one side and passed a Cosmos Sack over to him. After that, he began to instruct Chu Feng on what he should do after he entered the Dragon Vein Source, as well as what he should be wary of.

He even went to the extent of teaching Chu Feng a unique formation.

But while he was saying one thing on the surface, he was telling Chu Feng about another thing through a discreet voice transmission.

“There’s a bottle of black medicinal fluid inside the Cosmos Sack. When you enter the depths of the Dragon Vein Source, you’ll see a golden lake. Pour the black medicinal fluid into the lake. Before you do so, remember to set up the formation on the medicine bottle. It’s the formation that I have just taught you.”

As Chu Feng listened to those words, he took a look inside the Cosmos Sack, and indeed, there was a black bottle inside.

What was peculiar about this bottle was that it appeared to be a formation by itself, and a particularly powerful one at that. At the very least, it was one that Chu Feng was unable to set up with his current ability.

Such powerful formations were usually used to seal evil objects. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As such, without even prying open the lid to look at the contents of the black bottle, Chu Feng already knew that whatever that was inside the bottle was likely to be extremely dangerous.

“Grandmaster, could it be that...” Chu Feng asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist discreetly through voice transmission.

He had already realized that what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was going to have him do was not something that could be said out loud in the open. Otherwise, the latter wouldn’t have needed to tell him about it so secretively through voice transmission, and the ominous black bottle wouldn’t have such a powerful formation on it either.

“It’s just as you’ve thought. It’s just a safety precaution we’re taking, so you don’t have to worry about it... As long as the Dragon Clan fulfills the end of their deal, I don’t intend to make things difficult for them. The black medicine won’t harm them at all if so.

“However, if they are to renege on their words after the job is done, I’ll make sure that they dearly regret their actions!” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist harrumphed.

But a moment later, he suddenly added, “Chu Feng, are you feeling sorry for them?”

“I’ll do as you have said, master,” Chu Feng replied as he put away the Cosmos Sack.

“That’s more like my disciple!”

Seeing how decisively Chu Feng had agreed to it, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist nodded in approval.

On the other hand, Chu Feng shot a glance at the Supreme Elders around the area before finally turning his eyes in the direction where Long Mumu and her mother had departed.

Putting aside Long Mumu and her mother, whom they had already fallen out with, while the Supreme Elders gathered here acted respectfully toward both him and his master, it was impossible to tell what they were thinking on the inside.

After all, the two of them had already infringed on the authority of the Dragon Clan.

There was indeed a very high chance of the Dragon Clan reneging on its words once the deed was done.

In truth, Chu Feng also knew that they were making a very risky move here, and all this while, he had been thinking about how he could clean up the situation afterward.

However, this hand that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had prepared removed all of his worries.

Of course, Chu Feng knew that this was quite a despicable move to make, but if this could ensure his and his master’s safety, he wouldn’t hesitate to do it.

Besides, just as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had said, if the Dragon Clan were to fulfill their end of the bargain, they wouldn’t need to use this chip to threaten them.

But if the Dragon Clan dared to turn against them afterward, they would let the Dragon Clan know just what the two of them were capable of.

Don’t try to mend porcelain wares if you don’t have a metal pick with you.

In ancient China, there is a craft where people mend broken porcelain wares by pinning them together in a way similar to how we staple papers together nowadays. In order to do so, they need metal picks in order to create small holes to pin two porcelain shards together.

The saying means ‘don’t take on work if you don’t have the skills/equipment required to complete it’.
