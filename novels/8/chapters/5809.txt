Chapter 5809: Haha, Important Figures?

“Young master!” Jiang Taibai exclaimed. He didn’t want Jiang Kongping to share their plight with Chu Feng.

However, Jiang Kongping gritted his teeth and said, “We met with trouble. I’m begging you, please help me save my father. I know I have no right to request a favor from you, but I’m willing to pay any price you demand.”

He even kneeled to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng quickly supported Jiang Kongping back on his feet and said, “Calm down. We can slowly talk things through.”

He still had no idea what problem Jiang Kongping had encountered, and he thought that it would be better to gather more details first.

It turned out that Jiang Kongping’s father had discovered a good cultivation spot in the vicinity, especially if one had the right cultivation resources in possession.

Jiang Kongping had set his mind to work hard on his cultivation after leaving the Nine Souls Galaxy, so he looked for his father. His father immediately put down everything he had on hand and brought them here along with a few of his trusted aides.

Thus far, they had been in closed-door cultivation here.

Recently, they spotted a person wandering in the blood-colored desert, looking for their cultivation spot. That person had an exceptionally high standing in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

Even though Jiang Jingyu and the others had left the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, they still had feelings for the sect and had been wanting to go back. So, Jiang Jingyu decided to approach that person out of goodwill and inform her about the cultivation spot.

Little did they know that this person was practicing a demonic art. She noticed Jiang Kongping’s superior talent and unique bloodline, and she sought to kill him to supplement her cultivation.

Jiang Jingyu refused to hand Jiang Kongping over, so he was currently fending off that person by himself so as to buy time for Jiang Kongping’s escape.

“Chu Feng, that person is a highly influential individual who can do as she pleases in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. I know that there’s nothing in the world that intimidates you, but I should still give you a heads up. I’d understand it if you refuse to help us since it’d get you into trouble too, but if you do help us, I’ll do anything I can to repay you,” Jiang Kongping said with tearful eyes.

Laughter suddenly echoed. It was not from Chu Feng but the gray-cloaked figures behind him.

“You can reject it if you wish. What are you laughing for?” Jiang Yuantai asked with a frown. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He never intended to ask for Chu Feng’s help, so he found the laughter of the latter’s companions jarring, as he thought that they were mocking him.

“S-s-seriously! You should just tell us w-w-where that person is and w-w-what her cultivation is. There’s no one in the mere Pill Dao Immortal Sect w-w-whom my Brother Chu Feng dares not offend! They s-s-should be the one fearing my Brother Chu Feng!” Wang Qiang sneered.

“Just get to the point. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect means nothing to us,” Qin Xuan added.

Jiang Taibai and the others were conflicted to hear those words. They could tell that these people were strong, but their words were too arrogant. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect was not small fry, after all. It was a huge power with a reputation throughout the entire world of cultivation.

Even in the Totem Galaxy, it was second only to the Totem Dragon Clan.

Just who were these people to dare utter such arrogant words? Even if words were empty, surely they should think twice before running their mouths.

This made Jiang Taibai and the others think they were unreliable. Even so, Jiang Kongping continued staring at Chu Feng with hopeful eyes.

“Answer their question,” Chu Feng urged.

“She’s the daughter of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster, Jia Lingyi,” Jiang Kongping said.

“Jia Lingyi? Are you certain?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Yes, she’s Jia Lingyi. I know that she’s of exceptional standing, so I’d understand it if you refuse to help us,” Jiang Kongping said with a lowered head.

As much as he wanted Chu Feng to help them, he didn’t want to land Chu Feng into trouble, especially when he knew just how strong Jia Lingyi’s background was.

“You’re saying that Jia Lingyi is crossing blows with your father?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, she is,” Jiang Kongping replied.

“Is she alone?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, she’s alone. My father verified it before approaching her. No one is following her,” Jiang Kongping replied.

Chu Feng was surprised, not just because Jia Lingyi had come here alone but the fact she had the strength to fight with Jiang Jingyu. He had crippled Jia Lingyi’s spirit power and sapped her origin energies, which meant that she should have been a cripple now.

Could the Pill Dao Immortal Sect have treasures potent enough to help Jia Lingyi recover her spirit power?

“My father is an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. If she’s able to fight on par with my father, it’d mean that her spirit power is at the same level too. However, Jia Lingyi was a famed prodigy back in her era. I feel that it’s only a matter of time before my father falls in defeat,” Jiang Kongping said with a worried face.

“I understand. Are they over there?” Chu Feng asked as he pointed in the direction of the third remnant, as he deduced that the cultivation spot they had talked about was the third remnant.

“Ah? Y-yes, that’s right.”

Jiang Kongping had no idea how Chu Feng knew where Jiang Jingyu and Jia Lingyi were, but the direction he had pointed out was correct.

“Let’s go and see what’s going on,” Chu Feng said. He began flitting over to the third remnant, and he made sure to drag Jiang Kongping and the others along with him.

“This speed!” Jiang Taibai and the others were stunned.

They had thought that Chu Feng was a rank five Half-God level cultivator, but the speed he traveled at far surpassed that. This meant that he was even stronger than they had imagined.

“Is his world spirit that powerful? How did this child win over such a powerful world spirit?” Jiang Taibai couldn’t comprehend it.

The thought this was Chu Feng’s own cultivation never crossed his mind, as he didn’t think it was possible for anyone to grow so quickly. He thought that Chu Feng had won over an even stronger world spirit... though this sounded ridiculous to him too.

Soon, Chu Feng and the others heard explosions, and huge shockwaves began to appear.

Even from a distance away, Chu Feng could see two world spiritists crossing blows. One of them was a middle-aged man who was likely Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai’s father, Jiang Jingyu, and the other was a familiar-looking woman, Jia Lingyi.

Jia Lingyi was wearing a mask, but Chu Feng could tell from her aura that it was her.

Both of their spirit powers were at Immortal Dragon God-cloak.

“She regained her spirit power, though she isn’t fully recovered yet.” Chu Feng was surprised.

Jia Lingyi was previously a Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, a step away from becoming a True Dragon World Spiritist. She had regressed a rank, and even so, her fighting prowess as an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist wasn’t formidable.

She was barely able to stand her ground against Jiang Jingyu. It was probably the side effect of having her spirit power crippled back then.

Chu Feng hadn’t gone easy on her back then when he crippled her spirit power. He had made sure to be thorough about it, which was why the fact she could recover at all surprised him.

She must have consumed a lot of invaluable treasures on top of practicing her demonic skill.
