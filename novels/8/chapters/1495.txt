MGA: Chapter 1496 - Asking The Headmaster For Help

This time around, Chu Feng had exhausted a lot of his power. It took him four entire hours of recuperation for the King-level martial power, as well as his spirit power, to mostly recover. At the same time, his psychological condition had also become much better.

However, before Chu Feng could recover completely, he hurriedly got up. That was because a grand character had arrived in his palace. As for this person, it was none other than the headmaster of the Cyanwood Mountain, Dugu Xingfeng.

A personal visit from Dugu Xingfeng was the greatest honor to a disciple. Furthermore, to Chu Feng, this was also a very good opportunity to ask Dugu Xingfeng to help him.

Chu Feng left his bedroom and arrived in the guest room. He discovered that Dugu Xingfeng was sitting in the guest room. However, he was not sitting on the master’s seat, and was instead sitting on one of the side seats. Dugu Xingfeng was holding a tea cup and gently pursed his lips against it to drink the tea.

He was very free and at ease; it was as if this place were his home. There was no trace of seriousness to him at all. Furthermore, he was also not displaying the imposing might of a headmaster. Thus, he appeared to be very amiable and like an ordinary person.

However, Chu Feng knew that the man before him was no ordinary person. He was the headmaster of the Cyanwood Mountain, Dugu Xingfeng.

“Disciple Chu Feng pays his respects to Lord Headmaster,” After Chu Feng arrived, he immediately bowed respectfully to Dugu Xingfeng.

“Chu Feng, only you and I are here. Thus, there is no need for those etiquettes. Come, sit over here,” Dugu Xingfeng waved his hand at Chu Feng while smiling.

At this moment, Dugu Xingfeng was like a completely different person. If Dugu Xingfeng was a very imposing headmaster when before the various other headmasters, then the current Dugu Xingfeng appeared more like one’s relative. His amiable appearance did not appear to be fake. Instead, it seemed to be coming from the bottom of his heart.

Thus, Chu Feng did not try to be modest, as he knew that there was no need for him to be modest. Therefore, he walked over to Dugu Xingfeng and sat down beside him.

“Chu Feng, back then, I was in closed-door training and unable to take charge of the situation in the Cyanwood Mountain. I have caused you to suffer a lot. You wouldn’t possibly be bearing grudge against me, right?” Dugu Xingfeng asked with a smile on his face. However, there was actually a trace of worry in his eyes. He was truly worried that Chu Feng would bear grudges against him and have a bad impression of him.

“Indeed, I have been bullied and humiliated in the past. However, I will not bear grudges against anyone. At that time, my strength was insufficient. Thus, I cannot blame anyone but myself for being bullied and humiliated.”

“As for Lord Headmaster, you are a person capable of distinguishing right and wrong with acuity. You have handled matters fairly. You are a good headmaster. This disciple only has deep respect for you and holds no grudges toward you,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s good, that’s really good.” Dugu Xingfeng smiled a relieved smile. Then, he said, “Actually, I am actually not in favor of you becoming a nominal disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance. However, as the matter is already done, I also had to get over it.”

“Back then, my reaction might have been a bit drastic. However, that was because I thought highly of you. Thus, I hope that you will not take that to heart,” Dugu Xingfeng said.

“Selfishness... is something that everyone possesses. Lord Headmaster is no exception to that. This is something that this disciple can understand. However, the World Spiritist Alliance has truly treated this disciple very well, and helped him many times. I hope that Lord Headmaster will not have a bad relationship with the World Spiritist Alliance because of this disciple.” Chu Feng wished for the Cyanwood Mountain and the World Spiritist Alliance to coexist peacefully.

“Haha, you can rest assured about that. Not to mention that our Cyanwood Mountain has been allies with the World Spiritist Alliance this entire time, even if our relationship was not that good, I would still not make the World Spiritist Alliance into an enemy because of you.”

“Furthermore, as matters have developed to this state, I now think that you can become our Cyanwood Mountain and the World Spiritist Alliance’s bridge to a better relationship. Perhaps we might even be able to become alliance powers that enjoy honor and disgrace together and advance and retreat in unison,” Dugu Xingfeng said.

“If Lord Headmaster wishes for it, this disciple is willing to risk his life to help Lord Headmaster,” Chu Feng said.

“Haha, good, I knew that I did not misjudge you. Not only is your talent exceptional, your sense of loyalty and justice is also superb. Only a disciple like you is worthy enough for our Cyanwood Mountain to exhaust our all to nurture,” Dugu Xinfeng truly admired and appreciated Chu Feng.

This sort of admiration and appreciation was on the verge of extreme. Each and every word, each and every action that Chu Feng made would give Dugu Xingfeng an extremely good sensation of satisfaction.

After that, Chu Feng and Dugu Xingfeng chatted for a long time. From that, Chu Feng was able to sense that Dugu Xingfeng truly planned to nurture him.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng’s strength was completely different from before. Right now, if Chu Feng wished to reach a breakthrough, ordinary cultivation resources were simply unable to sate him. Only Natural Oddities or other rare cultivation resources were now able to sate Chu Feng.

Even though Chu Feng was very urgent to increase his cultivation, he did not wish to have others obtain cultivation resources for him.

After all, one must experience trials in order to grow.

This was akin to the difference between a wild tiger and a caged tiger.

The caged tiger possesses ample food and good living conditions. Thus, its body will grow massive and from a glance, it would appear to be extremely mighty.

As for the wild tiger, it does not possess sufficient food, and will be very thin and weak-looking. From a glance, it would appear to be lacking the might of tigers.

To many people, they would think that the caged tiger would be stronger. From merely their outward appearances, they would think that the caged tiger would be several times more powerful than the wild tiger.

However, if the two tigers were placed together and told to fight, the victor would definitely be the wild tiger.

Although the wild tiger would not possess the great treatment that the caged tiger had received, it would still be a tiger that had lived in the wild. In the wild, if it didn’t kill, it would be killed instead.

It would have experienced countless close quarter battles in order to continue living and It would have only managed to survive because of its abilities.

However, the caged tiger would be completely different. Even though it would have fed itself to be extremely robust, it would have only relied on its master to feed it. It itself would have never once hunted another animal before. It would be the sort of being that would only open its mouth when food arrived before it. Thus, it would have long since lost its wild nature.

For a tiger like that, its robust tiger body would be in vain, as it would not possess the heart to risk its life to fight against its enemy; nor would it possess the techniques to do so. If it were to fight against the wild tiger, how could it possibly be able to prevail over its opponent?

This was the same for martial cultivators. While one could receive help from another, one could not rely on others for everything. One must experience trials and tribulations, fight against enemies while risking one’s own life, in order to truly mature, and obtain true transformation.

Thus, Chu Feng did not ask his headmaster Dugu Xingfeng for cultivation resources. However, there was a matter that he had no choice but to ask him for. As for that matter, it was the one about going to the Cursed Soil Sect to save Tantai Xue.

While Chu Feng was able to take care of this matter himself, it would be extremely dangerous, with a very high chance that he would die. Furthermore, not only would he likely die, Tantai Xue would likely die too.

He did not wish to cause Tantai Xue to die because of his own recklessness. Thus, Chu Feng had to find people to help him. As for Dugu Xingfeng, he was a great candidate to ask for help from.

Finally, Chu Feng spoke. “Lord Headmaster, this disciple has a matter that I wish to request help in. Might Lord Headmaster be willing to help this disciple?”

“What matter might it be? There is no harm in telling me,” Dugu Xingfeng said with a smile.

“I wish to ask Lord Headmaster to assist me in saving a person,” Chu Feng said.

“Where will we go to save that person?” Dugu Xingfeng did not even bother to ask who Chu Feng wanted to save, and instead directly asked for the location.

Chu Feng was a bit surprised by Dugu Xingfeng’s reaction. However, he still replied, “the Cursed Soil Sect.”

“Oh, the Cursed Soil Sect?” Hearing those words, Dugu Xingfeng’s reaction was still not very large. With the same sort of calmness, he asked, “Who is this person to you? Must you definitely save this person?”

“She is my friend. This disciple must save her,” Chu Feng nodded. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Very well, I’ll help you save her. However, the Nine Powers Hunt has just ended. Thus, there are a lot of things that must be dealt with. I cannot set out to save her right away.”

“Furthermore, if we are to set out for the Cursed Soil Sect, we must do it in secret. Thus, it is unsuitable for us to set off together.”

“How about this? In two days, you are to leave the Cyanwood Mountain first and find a place to wait for me,” As Dugu Xingfeng spoke, he extended his finger, pointed at an empty region of space and gestured.

In an instant, the outline of a map appeared. The starting point on this map was the Cyanwood Mountain. As for the destination, it was a village’s tavern.

“This disciple understands. Thank you Lord Headmaster for helping me out,” Chu Feng was grateful from the bottom of his heart. From the moment he had spoken till now, Dugu Xingfeng did not have any sort of unusual behavior.

Dugu Xingfeng’s reaction was extremely calm. It was as if Chu Feng’s request was no surprise at all. Furthermore, it seemed like Chu Feng’s request was also within the range of a request that he could accept.

Most importantly, Dugu Xingfeng had only asked Chu Feng a couple simple questions. In fact, he did not even ask Chu Feng who it was that he planned to save, or even what sort of enmity that person had with the Cursed Soil Sect. From this, it could be seen how deeply confident he was in Chu Feng.

“There’s no need to be this courteous with me. Remember, I am your headmaster and also your family. The Cyanwood Mountain is your home. When one’s family member has something that they need help with, how could I possibly disregard it?”

“It’s quite late now, you have also been deeply exhausted by this battle today. You should rest. We shall meet again in three days’ time.” Dugu Xingfeng patted Chu Feng’s shoulder while smiling. Then, he left Chu Feng’s residence.

As Chu Feng watched the direction that Dugu Xingfeng left in, he smiled lightly.

Home? Those words spoken by Dugu Xingfeng was something that the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master had also mentioned to him before.

And now, they were indeed like family to Chu Feng, offering him help and protection.

This sort of sensation was extremely good for Chu Feng. Chu Feng knew that the current him was no longer the him from the past.

In the Holy Land of Martialism, this place with experts like clouds and dangers in every corner, Chu Feng was no longer alone. He now also had families, as well as family members who would treat him with sincerity.
