However, the starlight runes suddenly shattered before they could truly reach Jie Tian.

“This is bad!” Chu Feng’s heart tensed up.

The starlight runes had a formidable sealing power, but they couldn’t seal the power inside Jie Tian’s body. This showed just how powerful the power inside Jie Tian’s body was.

“Ki ki ki…” Sinister laughter echoed from Jie Tian’s body.

The black aura spurted out with even greater fervor. Within the blink of an eye, it had already reached over a million meters in height, towering all the way up to the high heaven. Even the layer of starlight runes in the sky was shattered by its presence.

It was at this point that the black aura suddenly began contracting, eventually stopping at a height of around a hundred thousand meters. By this point, the black aura had manifested into a silhouette.

It was a monster with a humanoid form but eighteen slender arms. It contemptuously gazed upon the world with blood-red eyes that looked reminiscent of two brilliant moons.

“It has been inside Jie Tian’s body all this while?”

Chu Feng recognized the black aura monster right away. It was the main body of the evil power!

“Paying respects to Lord Saint Exalted!”

The traitors kneeled on the ground. Their bodies were trembling, possibly out of excitement or fear.

Shoosh!

Little Fishy rushed to Chu Feng’s side and grabbed his hand before dragging him away at the fastest speed possible. That was the only way they could survive an encounter with such an existence.

Even if Little Fishy still had the starlight formation, she wouldn’t even survive a single clash against this monster. There was how huge the gap between them was.

Little Fishy was so fast that it didn’t take her long to completely throw off the monster behind her.

Boom!

All of a sudden, a powerful oppressive might fell upon Little Fishy and Chu Feng, sending the two of them crashing to the ground with huge craters.

It was Jie Tian. He had suddenly appeared before the two of them, though it could also be said to be the evil power too since the two of them could be considered to be one entity at this point.

“I have already told you, Xianhai Yu’er, that you can’t defeat me.” Jie Tian looked at Chu Feng and Little Fishy in disdain.

Little Fishy finally understood why Jie Tian was fearless. It turned out that he was housing something this terrifying inside of him.

“I’m sorry, big brother. I dragged you down,” Little Fishy said apologetically.

She felt bad that Chu Feng got dragged into this fight because of her.

“What nonsense are you spouting?” Chu Feng stroked her head, telling her that she shouldn’t blame herself.

The evil power that towered over a hundred thousand meters in height suddenly surged out of Jie Tian’s body and looked at Chu Feng with its blood-red eyes. It spoke with a deep and eerie voice, “What’s your name?”

“It’s none of your business,” Chu Feng replied.

He had no intention of caving in here. He doubted whether his father’s protective formation could protect him from a being of this tier.

“You have a backbone, but that won’t save you. The only one who can save you here is me. This Exalted has a high opinion of you. Become my disciple, and I’ll spare you,” the evil power said.

Shocked, Jie Tian quickly interjected, “Lord Saint Exalted, that man…”

“Quiet!” the evil power roared.

Jie Tian could only shut his mouth, but indignance brimmed in his eyes as he clenched his fists. It hadn’t been easy for him to obtain this fortuitous encounter, so he felt particularly aggrieved to see Chu Feng, who had been standing against them all this while, receive the same opportunity as him just like that.

“How is it, brat? Are you willing to join me?” the evil power asked.

“Yes, I’m willing,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Good. However, I need you to prove your sincerity to me first,” the evil power said.

“How can I prove myself?” Chu Feng asked.

Shoosh!

The evil power pointed its finger at Chu Feng, and a bundle of black aura flew toward the latter.

The bundle of black aura enveloped Chu Feng. From it, he sensed tremendous power, and this was nothing but a sliver of what the evil power was capable of. It made him more aware of the massive gap between him and the evil power.

“Kill her,” the evil power pointed to Little Fishy and said.

Chu Feng’s eyebrows shot up. “Are you certain?”

“Yes, I am,” the evil power said.

“All right.”

Chu Feng nodded his head as he directed a vicious look at Little Fishy. He channeled the black aura he had received from the evil power toward his hand and manifested it as a black spear. Then, with a powerful flick of his wrist, he hurled the black spear straight toward Jie Tian.

But before the spear could reach Jie Tian, it froze in mid-air. It was the evil power’s doing.

“Hahaha!”

Manic laughter shook the sky, but to Chu Feng, it sounded more like a death toll. He knew that he was doomed. As soon as the laughter stopped, the terrifying blood-red eyes fell on Chu Feng once more.

“Brat, I gave you a chance, but you refused it. Very well. Jie Tian, his life is yours.”

The frozen black spear landed in Jie Tian’s hand.

At the same time, the evil power tore itself away from Jie Tian, separating the two of them.

Jie Tian finally regained his freedom, but he didn’t throw the black spear toward Chu Feng. Instead, he swooped downward with the intent to personally skewer Chu Feng with the spear, as if that was the only way he could vent his anger.

On the other hand, Chu Feng was unable to move at all. He could only wait for his own death.

Ding!

Just as the black spear was able to impale Chu Feng’s chest, it suddenly stalled to a halt.

Jie Tian was taken aback. Something invisible had blocked his attack. No matter how he tried to exert his strength, he was unable to push his spear deeper in.

The evil power also noticed that something was amiss, so it fused more of its black aura into the spear with a tap of its finger, making it a hundred times stronger than before. Similarly, Jie Tian’s strength also increased by leaps and bounds.

“Gah!”

Jie Tian roared furiously as he gathered his full strength to skewer Chu Feng. His persistence paid off, as the black spear began inching closer toward Chu Feng’s chest. Right as the spear was about to land, a hand suddenly shot out of Chu Feng’s chest.

The hand grabbed the black spear and crushed it with its grip. The destroyed spear produced tremendous shockwaves that slammed Jie Tian into a distant mountain range.

The evil power couldn’t bring itself to continue watching as an onlooker anymore. It personally sent a massive palm down to end Chu Feng’s life.

In response, the hand extending from Chu Feng’s chest pointed at the sky and released a ray of golden light, severing the evil power into two.

Gah!

The evil power cried in agony as it looked at Chu Feng in fright.

Boom boom boom!

The surroundings tremored, as starlight runes appeared in the sky again. This time, there were a hundred times more starlight runes than before. Thunder roared as the starlight runes covered the sky, and vaguely, a chanting murmur could be heard.

The chanting murmur sounded divine and inviolable.

“This is bad!” The evil power’s blood-red eyes widened in fear.

It knew that the starlight runes were intended to seal off intruders like it. It had learned ways to circumvent the starlight runes in the years it had spent lurking in the Star Sea Realm, but that was also precisely the reason it understood that it wouldn’t stand a chance against the starlight runes if they fell on it on such a scale.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Starlight covered the earth, as countless massive swords rained from the sky. There were so many of them that they looked no different from torrential rain, but this time around, these swords were directed not at the evil power but Chu Feng.

The sealing power was triggered by Chu Feng!

“Heh!”

A laugh could be heard from Chu Feng’s body. This simple laugh shook the earth and the sky. Even the surrounding mountain range instantaneously collapsed into flat ground. It was almost as if the world around them had been destroyed, with the exception of them.

Similarly, the giant swords and starlight formations in the sky also instantaneously dissipated.

“This…”

Even the evil power was taken aback, let alone Jie Tian.

A brilliant light shone from Chu Feng’s body as a silhouette walked out from within.

“Y-you are?” the evil power asked in horror.

Just like how it towered beyond the reach of Chu Feng and the others, it could tell that the silhouette who had just walked out of Chu Feng’s body towered beyond its reach.
