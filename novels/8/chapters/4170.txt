Chapter 4170 - Challenging The People From The Dragon Clan

After being seriously injured, Long Daozhi lost his ability to fly and fell from the sky.

Just by telling the truth, he had received such treatment.

Long Daozhi was rather pitiful.

However, no one showed any pity for him.

Instead, they felt that he had asked for it. In fact, many people began to ridicule him.

Whilst the bystanders showed no concern for Long Daozhi, Chu Feng and the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City could not watch with folded arms.

They immediately soared into the sky and caught Long Daozhi before descending to the ground.

Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu immediately began to set up a spirit formation to seal off Long Daozhi’s wound and treat his injuries.

Long Daozhi’s injuries were not light at all. Although Lord Tonghe was merely teaching him a lesson, he had not held back.

Fortunately, Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were exceptional, and Grandmaster Liangqiu was there to help him.

If they were to treat Long Daozhi’s injuries immediately, it would not be too late, and he would be able to keep his cultivation.

However, if they were to drag it out, Long Daozhi’s cultivation would inevitably be damaged. That damage might even become permanent.

“Lord Tonghe, you’ve lied to me, you’ve deceived me!”

“I was clearly the one who handed the Dragon Vein Source Stone to you! It wasn’t the Nine Principles Dragon Sect!”

“Why are you doing this?!”

“Why are you so unjust?! Why?!”

Long Daozhi ignored his injuries and continued to shout.

However, due to how serious his injuries were, his condition was very weak, and his voice also sounded very weak.

His words did not arouse the attention of the crowd again.

Long Daozhi’s face was already streaming with tears. He was on the verge of collapse.

He had thought that he would be able to return to the Dragon Clan. Never did he imagine that he would be deceived and played like that.

All the painstaking efforts he had put forth had ended up benefitting someone else.

He realized that Chu Feng’s doubt had not been unfounded.

It was just that he’d never imagined that the Lord Tonghe that he respected so much would be so despicable.

He hadn’t expected Lord Tonghe to hand what belonged to him to someone else.

“Lord City Master, please say no more. If you continue to speak, they’ll kill you.”

“We’re not going to return to a Dragon Clan like this. Isn’t that fine?”

The people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City all began to urge Long Daozhi to stop. Some were so nervous that they actually extended their hands to cover his mouth.

Even though Long Daozhi’s voice was extremely weak, they were still afraid.

They were afraid that he would be heard by the people from the Dragon Clan.

If he truly enraged that Lord Tonghe, Long Daozhi might end up being killed.

“Senior, where there’s life, there’s hope.”

“We can take revenge for what has happened here today in the future,” Chu Feng said to Long Daozhi through voice transmission.

However, Long Daozhi did not react to his voice transmission. He continued to speak, and tears continued to roll down his eyes.

He seemed to have gone insane.

Chu Feng felt extremely pained to see Long Daozhi like that.

If he hadn’t placed such high hopes on being able to return to the Dragon Clan, how could he be in such sorrow?

Chu Feng raised his head and took a glance at Lord Tonghe who stood aloof in the sky. Coldness flashed through his eyes.

What had happened was not only a matter that concerned Long Daozhi.

After all, he was the person who had found the Dragon Vein Source Stone.

Even if it wasn’t for Long Daozhi’s sake, Chu Feng would not spare that Lord Tonghe.

Although he would not be able to do anything to him at present, Chu Feng was determined to return the debt from him in double.

What had happened with Long Daozhi was merely an incident.

To the majority of the crowd present, they’d only witnessed a comedy show.

After Long Daozhi had been seriously injured, barely anyone paid any attention to him.

At that moment, the crowd focused their eyes on the sky above.

The people from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had all flown up to the sky and were standing before Lord Tonghe in an orderly manner.

Lord Tonghe took out multiple Dragon Clan title plates and handed them to the people from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect in succession.

Seeing the Dragon Clan title plates, the eyes of many people began to shine. They all felt endless envy for the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.

What sort of honor was this?

Most importantly, the Dragon Clan title plates were the lifelong dreams of the people gathered below.

To many of them, even if they were unable to return to the Dragon Clan, merely being able to receive such a title plate would be an enormous honor. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Such precious title plates were being given to every single person from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.

Furthermore, Lord Tonghe even handed the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Sectmaster a Cosmos Sack.

That Cosmos Sack was filled with Dragon Clan title plates.

It was not only the people from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect present that were receiving Dragon Clan title plates; even the people from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect that were not present would receive Dragon Clan title plates.

From that moment on, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect would return to the Dragon Clan.

They would become members of the Dragon Clan.

Who in the Holy Light Galaxy would dare disrespect the Nine Principles Dragon Clan now?

Suddenly, Lord Tonghe spoke loudly, “From this moment on, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect will cease to exist. All of you are now members of our Dragon Clan.”

“Being members of our Dragon Clan, we will not tolerate any humiliation from others.”

“Yet today, there were people that actually dared to challenge the authority of our Dragon Clan.”

As he spoke, he swept his icy gaze downward.

The crowd immediately looked to each other in dismay. In the end, their eyes all landed on the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

Who would dare challenge the authority of the Dragon Clan?

No one among the crowd would dare do such a thing. But, if they had to find a possible culprit...

Then, Ancestral Martial Dragon City had challenged the authority of the Dragon Clan earlier.

Furthermore, they had challenged the aloof and remote Lord Tonghe’s authority on top of that.

For Lord Tonghe to suddenly say such a thing, it was clear that he did not plan to let things go.

Because of that, many people began to take delight in the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s misfortune.

They felt that they were doomed.

“Men, bring them forward”

Suddenly, Lord Tonghe retrieved his gaze and waved his sleeve.

Once Lord Tonghe gave the order, people from the Dragon Clan immediately flew out from the war chariot.

They were dragging two people.

Upon seeing those two people, the crowd present were all confused.

None of them recognized those two people.

However, when Chu Feng saw those two people, his heart tensed up.

He knew those two people.

They were an old man and a youth.

The old man’s name was Long Busheng, and the youth’s name was Long Xiao.

They were none other than the two people that Chu Feng had encountered in the Endless Abyss.

‘Damn it! I forgot to consider that!’

When Chu Feng had toyed with the Nine Principle Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster, he had disguised himself.

However, the old man and the youth had not disguised themselves.

Chu Feng had not expected the Nine Principles Dragon Sect to be so capable. He had not expected that they would be able to obtain help from the Dragon Clan and directly capture the old man and the youth.

“Those two people have challenged the authority of our Dragon Clan.”

“However, they are not the main culprits.”

“The main culprit is located here.”

As Lord Tonghe spoke, he cast his gaze downward.

“I hope that the main culprit will reveal himself.”

“Do not have your companions be implicated by you.”

“If you dare to reveal yourself, I will spare you and let you live.”

“However, if you do not reveal yourself, your two companions will die because of you.”

“As for you, I will find you sooner or later. Even if you flee to the ends of the world, you still won’t be able to escape death,” Lord Tonghe said coldly.

The person he was talking about was naturally none other than Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng had disguised himself back then. Thus, if they were to search for him according to his disguise, they simply wouldn’t be able to find him.
