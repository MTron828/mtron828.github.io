Chapter 5505: Commencement of the Mission

“While the Demon Crane possesses special powers, it is ultimately a treasure. It isn’t likely for it to possess its own independent will and ability to cultivate no matter how formidable it is. I don’t think that it’s likely that the Demon Crane had constructed that formation on its own accord to assimilate us. If we want to get to the bottom of this matter, we’ll have to wait for Daoist Demon Crane to wake up and share the origins of the Demon Crane with us,” Chu Feng said.

No one dared to make light of Chu Feng’s words even though he was only a junior. He had simply achieved too many inconceivable feats. For instance, he had just saved the lives of the Totem Dragon Clan’s prodigies yet again.

This was more than enough to show that his capabilities were the real deal.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief stared intently at Chu Feng with a hint of relief in his eyes. Chu Feng’s astounding feats made him even more certain that Chu Feng was the person whom he had seen in the prophecy. He was glad that he had chosen to befriend the latter.

“Lord Clan Chief, something is happening to the Immemorial Star Sea!” someone reported from outside.

Everyone quickly turned their eyes outside. Even through the walls, they could still clearly see the ongoing changes in the Immemorial Star Sea.

A mysterious blood-red fog had previously settled over the surface of the Immemorial Star Sea, stirring up a storm as it attempted to manifest physically. However, its attempt was foiled by the arrival of another gust of wind.

Currently, the gust of wind suppressing the blood-red fog had vanished, allowing the latter to freely manifest in the depth of the Immemorial Star Sea. Within moments, the blood-red fog dissipated to form a radiant path of light.

This path led into the heart of the Immemorial Star Sea, stopping right at where the blood-red fog had previously manifested. There, a door that gave off an air of solemn authority could be vaguely seen.

From the looks of it, an exceptional fortuitous encounter was awaiting them there.

It was such a shocking sight that those who were still caught up in the affairs surrounding the Demon Crane a moment ago immediately shifted their focus over.

Rather than harping about the past, they were much more interested in the huge fortuitous encounter right before their eyes. Some even began making their way over despite knowing that there was a force inside the Immemorial Star Sea that prevented outsiders from stepping in.

To their despair, they realized that they couldn’t enter the path at all.

To be clear, those people were able to enter the Immemorial Star Sea, though they had to withstand the toll that came with it, but they couldn’t step onto the path at all. This was true not just for the older generations but the juniors too.

“Why can’t we enter the path?”

“What’s the point of it appearing here then?”

“Is there some kind of special way to enter the path?”

The Totem Dragon Clansmen also began fervently discussing the matter.

The imposing door was so far away that they couldn’t tell if it was real, but the path was most definitely real. There was clearly some restriction imposed on the path, and they would have to figure out a solution if they wanted to access it.

Thus, the crowd began racking their brains. The same went for Chu Feng too.

“Chu Feng, are you able to find a solution?” Eggy asked excitedly.

She could tell that this was an invaluable fortuitous encounter, considering that the Immemorial Star Sea was one of the most enigmatic places in the vast world of cultivation. On top of that, they might just be able to meet Little Fishy if they could enter there.

Thus, she hoped that Chu Feng could figure out a way to access the path.

“I can’t find any clues at all.” Chu Feng had already tried employing his Heaven’s Eye, but it was to no avail.

“Why don’t you try the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk then?” Eggy asked.

“That won’t do. I still feel the same unsettling feeling from before. It’ll be dangerous if I resort to the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk,” Chu Feng said.

“I see…” Eggy nodded.

With both the Totem Dragon Clan and the Totem Phoenix Clan here, it wouldn’t be surprising if there were other experts concealed in the vicinity too. If so, there was a chance that one of them might recognize the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. A treasure of this caliber was bound to draw greed.

Chu Feng was not even the strongest among the juniors; he wouldn’t stand a chance against those from the older generation at all. That was why Eggy was inclined to trust his gut feeling.

Chu Feng’s gut feeling was built on the experiences he had accumulated over many years, alerting him to even the slightest whiff of danger. While his cultivation was not high enough to detect the underlying danger, he could still keenly sense danger from the atmosphere.

Shoosh!

A beam of light suddenly flew into the hands of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. It was so fast that no one other than him noticed it. As he grasped onto it, some information flowed into his mind. He opened his palm and saw a bead-sized formation in his grasp.

Inside the formation were many tokens reminiscent of keys.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief first looked at the juniors, followed by the distant door in the Immemorial Star Sea. There was a conflicted look on his face. He knew something about the door that no one else did, but his eyes eventually hardened with determination.

Shoosh!

With a wave of his sleeves, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief destroyed the formation. The tokens within flew out, heading in Chu Feng, Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, and the other juniors’ directions.

“Father, what’s this?” Long Chengyu asked.

The juniors present sensed an aura from the token that was similar to that of the path that had emerged on the Immemorial Star Sea. They vaguely understood that it was a key, possibly the crux to stepping onto that path. It also contained powerful concealment energy.

But how did the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief obtain this?

Instead of answering the question, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said, “With this token, you’ll be able to enter the path and head straight for the gate. Once you enter the gate, you’ll have to look for an incomplete formation and complete it. That’s your mission. However, your safety should be prioritized above all things else, understood?”

“Father, could this be the task we have to accomplish here?” Long Chengyu asked.

“That’s right,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s juniors trembled with excitement. They had known that there was something they needed to accomplish here, though they didn’t know what it was. They hadn’t expected it to be something related to the Immemorial Star Sea.

They weren’t just witnessing history in the making; they were going to make history!

Naturally, they were excited by that notion.

“Father, is there anything else inside the gate other than that incomplete formation? Can we enter the Immemorial Star Sea through that gate?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I don’t know what’s in there either. All I know is that there’s an incomplete formation you have to complete. Your bloodline power will be needed for that. It’ll be beneficial to our Totem Dragon Clan if you accomplish that task. Remember, your safety should take precedence. Should the undertaking prove to be dangerous, surrendering is an option,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Rest assured, father. We’ll be careful,” Long Chengyu replied. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief then turned to Chu Feng and said, “Young friend Chu Feng, this journey will be dangerous. I’ll be troubling you to take care of them. Here’s your compensation.”

He took out a Cosmos Sack and passed it to Chu Feng.

“Elder Clan Chief, you don’t have to be so courteous with me. I am good friends with Brother Chengyu and Miss Muxi.” Chu Feng tried to turn down the gift.

However, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief forcefully placed the Cosmos Sack into Chu Feng’s hands and said, “I’d be too embarrassed to ask for your help if you don’t accept this.”
