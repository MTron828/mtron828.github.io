“Ancestral Martial Realm Sect?”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders were overjoyed to see the key, but they weren’t surprised in the least.

“Judging from your expressions, you must have guessed the origin of this remnant through the items I have provided to you. You knew from the start we were looking for the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

“We aren’t interested in the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect, but they have monopolized a huge amount of resources in the early years of the present era, including the remnant of the World Spiritist Emperor. It was due to the World Spiritist Emperor’s remnant that the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect became the dominant power in the early years of the present era.

“The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect have left many remnants behind, but their main city, where their true treasures are buried, has yet to be found,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master said.

“I’m impressed. You are well aware of the situation in the present era,” Puppeteer Exalted said with a chuckle.

“Stop beating around the bush, Puppeteer Exalted. We have been following your instructions thus far. It’s time for you to reveal your true plan. What do we have to do to get to the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city?” the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“As you have said, the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect has inherited the World Spiritist Emperor’s heritage. They possess incredible means and treasures. It won’t be easy to make the main city they have hidden appear. We need a greater power than theirs to do so.

“The motive of our earlier operation wasn’t to breach the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation and go on a slaughter. Rather, the goal is to siphon the protective formation’s energy. Thus, those who have lost their lives inside the protective formation have not died in vain. They have entered with my formation and fused it into the protective formation.

“Now that the fusion is complete, even though we still won’t be able to breach the protective formation, I’m at least able to tap into the energy of the protective formation now. However, that’s only one of the criteria required. We also have to pay a price for it too.”

Puppeteer Exalted changed his hand seal, and the formation core expanded to tens of thousands of times greater than before. “Please enter the formation.”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders bellowed, “Enter the formation.”

While Puppeteer Exalted didn’t tell them that they were going for the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant, he did warn them that they would have to pay a heavy price for this operation. They joined the operation despite that because they had deduced from the items provided by Puppeteer Exalted that the remnant was the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city.

The treasures inside there justified the price they had to pay for it.

Under the orders of the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders, all of the Ancient Era’s clansmen stepped into the formation core.

“Hold on no matter what it takes, even at the cost of your life. This will determine whether we succeed or not,” Puppeteer Exalted said before changing his hand seal.

A formation light beam infused with the bloodline powers of the six Ancient Era’s clans gushed toward the black light spirit formation gate.

There was a restriction on the spirit formation gate such that only those beneath True God level could enter, and this included power too. Thus, the formation light beam couldn’t pass through the spirit formation gate. Instead, it fused into the spirit formation gate, and through that, it fused into the protective formation.

“What are they doing?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster panicked.

Sensing that something was amiss, she quickly channeled the protective formation to stop them, but it was to no avail.

“Chu Feng!”

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster turned to Chu Feng, but the latter had passed out. He might have been able to think of a solution if he was awake, but he had exhausted himself too much reinforcing the formation earlier that it would be dangerous to forcefully wake him up.

Gah!

Meanwhile, inside the formation realm, the Ancient Era’s clansmen were wailing in agony inside the massive formation core.

Most of their bodies had withered into skeletons. The formation had consumed not only their bloodline powers but their life force too. Some of them couldn’t take it anymore and tried to escape, only to find that they were unable to move at all. They had been bound in place.

They couldn’t speak or relay voice transmissions at all. There was nothing they could do other than wailing in agony. They could only watch helplessly till they dropped dead and died.

One by one, they collapsed as their life force was sucked out of them.

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders saw what was happening, but they turned a blind eye to it. They knew this was the price they had to pay. Sacrifices were inevitable. They had already abandoned their close kin; they could do the same for their clansmen too.

They didn’t think what they were doing was wrong.

Death came to all. What was more important was the value behind the death. In their eyes, there was nothing more valuable than dying for their clan. Their sacrifices would pave the future for their clans. Once they obtained the World Spiritist Emperor’s treasures, their clans would surely rise to an unprecedented height, surpassing even their ancestors.

The light beam finally came to a halt.

It had to, as all of the Ancient Era’s clansmen inside the formation had collapsed onto the floor. They were reduced to skeletons, and most of them had breathed their last. Even the treasures inside the formation core had withered. It was a tragic scene.

But none of the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders blamed Puppeteer Exalted. Instead, they turned their sights to him.

Puppeteer Exalted took out the pendant he was wearing around his neck. He slotted the old key into the pendant before forming a hand seal.

The Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation began to contract.

“This isn’t good! They can control the protective formation!” The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was alarmed.

As the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation contracted, the auras of the Ancient Era’s clans began emerging from it. This indicated that the two formations had fully merged, allowing the Ancient Era’s clans to control the protective formation too.

Even the crowd spectating from a far distance away noticed that too.

“Even such a powerful protective formation is unable to fend off the Ancient Era’s clans. The Ancient Era’s clans are more formidable than I thought...”

While they had nothing to do with this battle, they were still intimidated by what they saw.

The Ancient Era’s clans viewed the present-era cultivators with hostility. It was not good news to them that the Ancient Era’s clans were this powerful.
