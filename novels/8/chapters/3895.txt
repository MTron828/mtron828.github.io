Chapter 3895 - No Longer Hiding Anything

Chu Feng felt enormously moved.

He felt himself to be very fortunate to be able to receive the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s inheritance.

Whether it be his rank eight Exalted-level cultivation, the gem that was able to help him make a breakthrough to Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, or the four Exalted Taboo Martial Skills, they were all priceless possessions.

However, most precious of all would naturally be the Monster Slaying Sword on Chu Feng’s back.

Chu Feng removed the Monster Slaying Sword from his back and held it in his hand. Holding it, he had an indescribable feeling.

Although the Monster Slaying Sword no longer had a soul, and was nothing more than a casing, the difference he felt holding the sword was akin to the difference between the death of an expert martial cultivator and the death of an ordinary person.

The remains left behind after their death would be completely different.

The bones of ordinary people were merely ordinary bones. Even feral dogs would be able to gnaw them to pieces.

However, the bones of expert cultivators were incomparably tough. Even ordinary blades would not be able to cause any damage to them.

If their source energy remained, they would be even more indestructible..

“I cannot expose a treasure like this. I must put it away properly.”

After examining the Monster Slaying Sword, Chu Feng felt particularly fond of it. Thus, he immediately put it away.

Ignoring how well-regarded of a sword the Monster Slaying Sword used to be, merely because of the fact that it was the key to opening the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s other tomb, which contained all of his treasures, Chu Feng would naturally have to keep it well-hidden.

Thinking of how he would only be able to open the tomb once he became a Martial Exalted, Chu Feng felt his blood surge with endless excitement just from thinking about what sort of treasures were stored in the tomb.

After all, Martial Exalted was such a distant level of cultivation.

Chu Feng had never even met a Martial Exalted-level expert.

He didn’t even know if there were any Martial Exalted-level experts in the Holy Light Galaxy.

However, Chu Feng knew that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s cultivation when he was alive would most definitely have been above Martial Exalted.

The inheritances he had left behind would definitely be very outstanding too.

However, when thinking about the Great Monster Slayer Emperor, Chu Feng felt even more sorrow in his heart.

Even though the Great Monster Slayer Emperor should’ve died a very long time ago...

Chu Feng still felt great regret to witness someone of such caliber dying before him.

That said, Chu Feng did not immerse himself in grief.

After all, one must always look forward.

Besides, no matter how exceptional of a figure the Great Monster Slaying Emperor might have been, he was indeed not someone of this era.

Afterwards, Chu Feng left that space.

As Chu Feng had obtained the inheritance and grasped the even greater power of the tomb’s spirit formation, he was able to move about freely in the tomb.

Thus, Chu Feng soon returned to where the Mystic Cave Saints were.

“Brother Asura, you’ve returned.”

Upon seeing Chu Feng, the Mystic Cave Saints immediately rushed up to him. “Where’s the Great Monster Slayer Emperor?”

They seemed to be more interested in the Great Monster Slaying Emperor.

“Senior Great Emperor has left...” said Chu Feng.

“Left? Where to?” asked the Mystic Cave Saints.

Seeing the sorrowful look on Chu Feng’s face, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints asked with surprise, “He couldn’t possibly have died right?”

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded his head.

“What happened? Why would he leave all of a sudden?”

“Even though the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was a remnant soul, he was extremely stable and he did not seem like he would disperse anytime soon,” said the Mystic Cave Saints.

“It is senior Great Emperor himself who decided to leave,” said Chu Feng.

“So that’s the case...”

“That’s truly unfortunate...”

The Mystic Cave Saints understood Chu Feng’s words. That said, they still had looks of pity on their faces.

“That’s truly rare. Money grubbers like yourselves are actually feeling such emotions for someone that you’ve only just met.”

Chu Feng felt very surprised. The Mystic Cave Saints were not merely expressing looks of regret. They were also feeling very sad. It was as if the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was a relative to them.

They were expressing pain as if they’d lost a relative.

Most importantly, their emotions didn’t seem to be fake. They were feeling sadness from the bottom of their hearts.

“Actually, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was a benefactor to our clan’s ancestors.” Eleventh said all of a sudden.

“Benefactor?”

Chu Feng revealed a look of curiosity upon hearing those words.

The eleven Mystic Cave Saints began to tell Chu Feng about what had happened in the past.

During the days of their Mystic Cave Clan’s prosperity, practically everyone knew about them.

Although the Mystic Cave Clan was very powerful, they could not be considered to be top-rated in that era. Because of that, they were in a constant state of danger, and would inevitably be attacked by other powers.

Before their clan was extinguished, the Mystic Cave Clan had been attacked by a very strong power. Furthermore, that power was none other than the Madstorm Clan.

Fortunately, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor had just so happened to pass by them at that time.

It was the Great Monster Slayer Emperor who had beaten back the Madstorm Clan and saved the Mystic Cave Clan all on his own.

Although the Mystic Cave Clan were ultimately wiped out by the Madstorm Clan, the Mystic Cave Saints deeply remembered the grace the Great Monster Slayer Emperor had shown to their clan.

Upon learning about this, Chu Feng suddenly discovered that he had misjudged the Mystic Cave Saints.

Earlier when the Mystic Cave Saints had seen the Great Monster Slayer Emperor, they had been extremely excited; immediately got on their knees and were praising the Great Monster Slayer Emperor nonstop whilst staring at him with looks of admiration in their little eyes.

At that time, Chu Feng had thought that the Mystic Cave Saints were bootlicking the Great Monster Slayer Emperor so that they could gain benefits. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, after hearing their story, he realized that they had been sincere in their actions.

Chu Feng then asked the Mystic Cave Saints about what had happened to their Mystic Cave Clan.

In the end, it was as the Monster Slayer Emperor had said, and Chu Feng had anticipated.

The Madstorm Clan had ultimately wiped out the Mystic Cave Clan.

At that time, only a small number of Mystic Cave Clansmen had managed to escape.

And now, after all these years, the eleven Mystic Cave Saints were the final survivors of the Mystic Cave Clan.

Their parents and other clansmen had all died...

They were the last of the Mystic Cave Clansmen left in the world.

“Do you all know the whereabouts of the Madstorm Clan?” asked Chu Feng.

“The Madstorm Clan has left. They’re no longer in the Holy Light Galaxy.”

“As for where they went, we have no idea. However... as long as we brothers are still alive, we will definitely find them and avenge our ancestors.”

“That is a hatred that cannot be erased no matter how many eons pass.”

Chu Feng was able to sense the fury in their hearts as the Mystic Cave Saints said those words.

“Brother Asura, what we’ve told you is our great secret. Since you’ve learned of our secret, shouldn’t you tell us your secret too?”

That being said, the Mystic Cave Saints were, in the end, the same Mystic Cave Saints. One could not judge them by normal standards.

Even though they had clearly been gnashing their teeth furiously and acting like they would definitely get revenge, they immediately changed their expressions the next instant and began to inquire about Chu Feng’s secret with smiles on their faces.

Chu Feng truly didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry when seeing the Mystic Cave Saints’ behavior.

That said, he felt what the Mystic Cave Saints had said to be reasonable. To them, what they’d told him was indeed an enormous secret.

Thinking back, the Mystic Cave Saints were a mystery to the entire All-heaven Starfield.

Yet, they’d opened up to Chu Feng and had told him so many things about themselves.

Even though Chu Feng had already gained a rough idea of their history from the Great Monster Slayer Emperor before they’d said anything, there was still a difference, since they were willing to tell him personally.

Their behavior signified that they were sincere with him.

“Actually, there’s something that I don’t quite understand. You all appear to be very shrewd, have only known me for a short period of time, and don’t even know about my origin. Why would you be willing to tell me all those things?” asked Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, it is true that we do not know you well. However, we know your character. Earlier, for the sake of saving us, you gave up on the inheritances. Truth be told, if we brothers were the ones in your shoes, we might not necessarily be able to do such a thing.”

“After all, those were the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s inheritances.”

“That’s right. What we’ve said is the truth. Between the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s inheritances and your life, we’re not afraid to say, regardless of whether you might be enraged or not, that we will very likely choose the former.”

“It is as you said, we do not know each other well, and have only known each other for a short period of time. Yet, you were willing to save us with the price of abandoning the inheritances.”

“We brothers will not possibly forget this grace for the rest of our lives.”

“Since you’re the one that saved our lives, what is there for us to keep from you?” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.
