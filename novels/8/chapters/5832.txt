Chapter 5833: The One Blocking the Path

“You know the disparity in the cultivation resources between us and Brother Chu Feng. Touch your heart. Do you think you’ll be able to reach your current level if not for our clan’s support? Even so, Brother Chu Feng still caught up with us. His talents are unquestionable. Soon, our advantage over him in terms of our clan’s support will start to fade. 

“Little sister, I know you want to cultivate alongside Brother Chu Feng, but right now, it’s still more beneficial for you to tap into our clan’s cultivation resources. If you wish to stay by his side, you should work harder on your cultivation. You can’t afford to rest, or he’ll leave you behind. By then, unless you wish to be a baggage to him, you won’t be able to travel with him anymore for your entire life. 

“Look at the people he had previously traveled with. Are any of his good friends from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm still with him, other than Miss Miaomiao? Why do you think Miss Miaomiao can travel with him?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked. 

His tone started stern before slowly mellowing down.

Little Fishy fell silent. 

Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy had communicated via voice transmission, but Chu Feng still sensed something was amiss from the atmosphere. Thus, he asked, “Are the two of you discussing something?”

“Big brother, how long will it take for you to decipher the Junior Blessing Formation?” Little Fishy asked.

“I’m not certain, but it’ll take some time. I’d guess… around two months to a year? I’d have to decipher one first to get a better estimate,” Chu Feng said.

“Big brother, I’ll return to the clan first with my brother. I’ll look for you in two months,” Little Fishy said.

“All right, go ahead.” 

Chu Feng knew Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy had their own business to attend to, not to mention that he needed to dedicate his time and energy to deciphering the Junior Blessing Formation so he wouldn’t be able to interact with them even if they stayed here. 

“Brother Chu Feng, you should crush this if you need help.” Xianhai Shaoyu passed a formation token to Chu Feng. 

Chu Feng accepted the token. He could tell what was the use of the formation token. 

Xianhai Shaoyu had likely assigned someone in the auction’s vicinity to protect him. The moment Chu Feng crushed the formation token, that person would quickly rush to the scene. Of course, this would only work if he was in proximity to that person. 

In truth, Chu Feng didn’t want to bring the Immortal Sea Fish Clan into his affairs, knowing how formidable the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was. Nevertheless, he still accepted the gift as it was a token of Xianhai Shaoyu’s goodwill. 

Even if he didn’t accept it, Xianhai Shaoyu would have still assigned someone to protect him. 

Following that, Little Fishy and Xianhai Shaoyu took their leave. 

While the two of them made their way out, Xianhai Shaoyu asked, “Have you thought things through? It looks like you’re worried about becoming Brother Chu Feng’s burden?”

“That’s not so,” Little Fishy replied.

“Oh?” Xianhai Shaoyu was skeptical. 

“I want to spend more time with big brother because he’s one of my few friends. However, your words reminded me of something. I’m returning not because I’m worried about lagging behind big brother, but because I don’t want to become weak. I don’t need to protect big brother because he has the means to do so himself. What I want to protect is our Immortal Sea Fish Clan and you,” Little Fishy said.

“Hoh, you have grown up. You know to protect me now,” Xianhai Shaoyu said with a smile.

“You might be annoying, but you’re my brother, after all. I can’t sit still as others beat you up,” Little Fishy said.

“I was feeling touched a second ago, but now I feel like you’re making fun of me. Do I look so weak as to get beaten up that easily?” Xianhai Shaoyu snorted.

Meanwhile, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion learned that Chu Feng had rejected their invitation, though they still didn’t know the person they had extended their invitation to was Chu Feng. 

“How arrogant of him to reject Lord Elder’s invitation! I’d love to know what his background is!”

Many in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were infuriated. Some of them even wanted to confront the man to know why he had rejected their offer.

“Hold it.” Jie Yefeng stopped them. “Everyone has their pursuit. There’s no need to force things. We can’t bring all the talents in the world under our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

The others suppressed their anger. It was not because they were thinking of the larger picture, as Jie Yefeng did, but that they were simply heeding instructions. 

… 

Shortly after, Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy took off their cloaks and revealed their true faces. They had already gotten onboard the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s floating warship and were returning to the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.

This warship wasn’t large, but its speed far surpassed that of other floating warships. It was flying the flags of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, but it was evident from the aura of the Ancient Era it emanated that it was an ancient treasure. 

Gathered on the warship were the powerhouses of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.

Other than Grand Elder Xianhai Youwei, the other elders gathered here were of exceptional standing too. Even Xianhao Shaoyu and Little Fishy’s father and mother were on this floating warship. 

“I didn’t think you would stumble upon such a huge fortuitous encounter with young friend Chu Feng.” The Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief was emanating a similar aura as the floating warship as he was channeling it. He looked overjoyed. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

They had learned about how Little Fishy and Xianhai Shaoyu had entered the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation and succeeded in their dao creation.

“Father, I told you big brother is formidable! You doubted me back then, but this proves it, right? However, he’s currently under the pursuit of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Is it possible for our Immortal Sea Fish Clan to protect him?” Little Fishy suddenly asked.

“Little Fishy, I’m not opposed to you being on good terms with Chu Feng, but our Immortal Sea Fish Clan cannot fight for an outsider,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Little Fishy wanted to protest, but Xianhai Shaoyu stopped her.

“Father, it’s better to deliver charcoal in winter. Little Fishy is motivated by her personal feelings, but I'd say Chu Feng is a talent worth befriending at all costs,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Shaoyu, our Immortal Sea Fish Clan doesn’t fear any enemy. We’ll fight anyone who dares invade us. However, Chu Feng is not an Immortal Sea Fish Clansman. To offer him protection now means to declare war on the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and that’d lead to casualties on our side. Chu Feng’s life is important, but so is our Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen's,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said. 

“But father…”

“No buts. Everyone has their own path to walk. It’s the same for Chu Feng. I don’t mind you getting on close terms with him, even after he has declared war on the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. However, that’s your personal affair. As a clan chief, I won’t permit you to sacrifice our clansmen to protect your friend,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy’s mother spoke up too, “Shaoyu, Yu’er, you should understand where your father is coming from. He has to prioritize our clan’s interest above everything. Furthermore, you have seen Chu Feng’s means. He doesn’t necessarily require our protection.”

Boom!

Just then, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s floating warship shook. 

All of the elders whipped out their weapons and stood at attention. Even Little Fishy’s mother and Grand Elder Xianhai Youwei revealed uneasy looks.

Their floating warship was a treasure from an ancient remnant, and it had a powerful concealment ability. Furthermore, it was being channeled by the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief, so its speed and concealment effect were stronger than ever. 

Yet, a person had stopped their floating warship with a single hand. 

Without a doubt, the person before them was terrifyingly powerful, likely no weaker than the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief.
