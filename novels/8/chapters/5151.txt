Chapter 5151: The Usage of the Corridor

Weng!

The trial formation dissipated, and a key manifested above Chu Feng. He found that he was unable to keep or conceal the key, which meant that it would follow him above his head no matter where he went.

This meant that his location had been revealed.

He finally understood why Bai Yunqing didn’t stow away his key but instead allowed it to float above him. It turned out that he couldn’t keep the key either.

The trial had left Chu Feng drenched in sweat, but his complexion was reddened and he was in high spirits. The final formation had healed him up.

He was already at his limit at the exalted dragon trial, but through sheer willpower and tenacity, he managed to hold on to the very end. This was the precious asset he had tempered over countless life-and-death situations.

The trials had been so difficult that he was in a horrible condition by the end, perhaps even more so than Bai Yunqing. It was fortunate that the formation healed him up after he overcame the saint dragon trial, leaving him even more spirited than before.

“What’s your background?” Bai Yunqing looked at Chu Feng and asked.

While he was still unable to see Chu Feng, he was able to determine Chu Feng’s location through the key floating above his head. His attitude was much more subdued after witnessing Chu Feng’s feat. At the very least, his eyes were no longer filled with disdain.

“You’ll soon know,” Chu Feng replied.

“Arrogant fellow. Did you think that you’re better than me just because you beat me once? The competition isn’t over yet! I swear that I won’t let you have any more victories beyond this!” Bai Yunqing sneered before proceeding ahead.

Chu Feng smiled in response before advancing ahead.

It was yet another empty long corridor beyond the hall. Chu Feng racked his brain but he couldn’t figure out the significance behind the corridor. If it simply served as a connector between the halls, there wasn’t any reason to make them so long.

At the end of the corridor was another spirit formation gate.

Beyond the spirit formation gate was yet another hall that was identical to the previous. The projection of Lord Zhenlong was already waiting inside.

Bai Yunqing and Chu Feng had already entered the hall by then, but Lord Zhenlong remained immobile, not reacting in the least. This meant that the third person wasn’t here yet, possibly still walking along the corridor.

Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing continued waiting a while longer, but the third person still didn’t enter the hall. This infuriated Bai Yunqing, prompting him to return to the corridor to bellow, “Tiger trash, what are you wasting your time here for? Hurry up! We’re all waiting for you!”

However, there was no response from Lord Tiger.

“Damn it! What is that trash up to?”

Bai Yunqing returned to the palace murmuring curses under his breath. He turned to the projection of Lord Zhenlong and asked, “Lord Zhenlong, that fellow must be stalling time because he knows that it’s impossible for him to acquire your legacy. He should be punished for his insolence. Why don’t we just kick him out of the trials? It’s a waste of time to wait for him.”

While the projection of Lord Zhenlong was manifested from a formation, it had displayed some level of intelligence thus far. He thought that the projection might listen to his suggestion and deal with Lord Tiger accordingly, but to his disappointment, the projection didn’t respond at all.

I didn’t think that the formation would be so austere. It looks like we’ll have to wait for that Tiger guy before we can continue with the trials.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had also started thinking about the situation. He wondered if the Tiger person was simply trying to annoy them by stalling time here. In the first place, it was weird how the three of them had to be present in order to proceed to the next trial.

If one person chose not to proceed on, wouldn’t that mean that they were all stuck?

A True Dragon World Spiritist like Lord Zhenlong wouldn’t have been oblivious to such a possibility, which meant that he had his own consideration when setting up the trials.

Thus, Chu Feng also returned to the corridor to take a look.

“Hm?”

Chu Feng quickly sensed spirit power that was stronger than Bai Yunqing, likely reaching the level of a Purple Dragon God-cloak. That was power comparable to a rank four Half-God cultivator.

To be clear, the power was well-concealed, such that Chu Feng wouldn’t have been able to sense it under normal circumstances. It was only through the power of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk that he noticed it, though it didn’t provide him with many clues. He had no idea what the spirit power was doing or where the other party was.

In any case, it was clear that the Tiger person was plotting something.

The Tiger person hadn’t had much success with the trials thus far, such that one could easily mistake him to be the weakest amongst them. However, it was evident now that he was actually the strongest amongst them. Being a Purple Dragon God-cloak meant that he was even stronger than Bai Yunqing!

This made Chu Feng cognizant of how weak he was once again. It was fortunate that he had the Asura World Spirit Army with him, or else he wouldn’t have been able to stand against the others.

Against such opponents, it was unlikely that he would be able to leave this place safe and sound even if he managed to acquire the legacy.

“It looks like I’ll have to be more careful,” Chu Feng muttered to himself.

It was apparent that the Tiger person was constructing a formation, but Chu Feng couldn’t tell whether the formation was to clear the trial or to deal with Bai Yunqing and him. In any case, he had no plans of allowing the Tiger person to get his way, especially now that he had a key constantly divulging his whereabouts.

He had to find some way to hide the key.

It was not as if he hadn’t tried anything. He attempted to cloak the key with the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, but it was to no avail. This time, he attempted it with his spirit power, and much to his surprise, he actually succeeded.

Just a simple concealment formation actually concealed the key that he was unable to hide with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak!

He returned to the hall and found that the key was still in a concealed state.

It was a success!

But why would this be the case?

It didn’t make sense that a simple concealment formation would be able to hide a key that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak couldn’t. It was due to how counterintuitive it was that he didn’t even bother trying it in the first place.

“Corridor! Could it be that corridor?!”

A possibility suddenly came to Chu Feng, and his eyes lit up. He stepped through the spirit formation gate and returned to the corridor. There, he tried to release his spirit power and quickly noticed an anomaly.

His senses told him that his spirit power was still at rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation, but its true potency was above that of a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. This was the effect caused by another energy lingering in his body—the ancient remnant’s energy that he had absorbed earlier at the entrance.

He thought that the ancient remnant’s energy served as a key that granted him access to the depths of the ancient remnant, but it had the effect of greatly enhancing his spirit power too. The previous him would have struggled against a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, but the enhancement allowed him to easily triumph over any Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.

He tried returning to the hall and exerting his spirit power, but he was only able to exert his usual level of spirit power there.

“The corridor does serve a purpose. It isn’t just for show!” Chu Feng exclaimed in realization.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
