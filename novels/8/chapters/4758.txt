Chapter 4758: Are You Intending to Harm Me?

Divine light filled the surroundings. It was so blinding that even cultivators of their caliber dared not to open their eyes. It was only fortunate that the light didn’t linger for long before fading.

They realized that even though their relative positions to one another were still the same, their surroundings had begun changing. They were no longer in the Vicious Beast Hellworld anymore, and the terrifying black tornado was nowhere to be seen.

Instead, they were in a very clean place devoid of grass and wood. It was a white world of emptiness, but it felt oddly peaceful, as if it was a sanctuary of some sort.

The Hellking was still present at the same spot, just that it had morphed into a white sculpture. Its appearance still looked rather ferocious, but for some reason, the feeling it induced in others was no longer one of fear but divinity.

Most importantly of all, its opened mouth was actually a spirit gate formation. On the spirit gate formation were four huge words—Hidden Dragon Illusory Palace!

Despite only being a spirit formation gate, the aura it gave off was divine too. The crowd couldn’t help but feel excited as they knew the land beyond the spirit formation gate was bound to contain a great fortuitous encounter for them.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was still standing on the head of the Hellking. Despite his small body, he stood tall and lofty, as if he was the ruler of this space. In comparison to Zuoqiu Yanliang, who was still weeping pitifully, having not yet recovered from his mental breakdown, it was made apparent to everyone just who the coward here was.

“Junior Chu Feng, where is this place? Didn’t you say that we’ll be cultivating separately?” someone amidst the crowd asked curiously.

Chu Feng pointed to the spirit formation gate in the mouth of the Hellking and said with a smile, “This is the fortuitous encounter I’m talking about. Once you enter the spirit formation gate, you’ll walk right into the illusion. There, you’ll be able to obtain some benefits that are bound to be greater than whatever you can earn from hunting in the Vicious Beast Hellworld.

“At the same time, you’ll be put through a trial too. If you can clear the trial, you’ll be able to obtain greater benefits and leave this place in advance. If you fail to clear the trial, there’s nothing to worry about either since there’s no punishment here. However, you’ll be trapped in the illusion until it finally dissipates. There won’t be anything bad to it, just that you’ll be staying here for a little longer.”

“So, we can just walk into the spirit formation gate now and challenge the trial in the illusion? Junior Chu Feng, since you have such a deep understanding of the place, can you tell us what’s in the trial and what do we have to do in order to clear it?” a personal disciple asked.

“Indeed, Junior Chu Feng. Give us a bit of pointer. If we can clear the trial and obtain greater benefits, we definitely won’t forget your grace.”

The other personal disciples chirped in as well.

“To be frank with you, while I am able to govern everything here through the powers of the Hellking, I’d turn into no more than an ordinary mortal like you inside the Hidden Dragon Illusory Palace. So, it’s not that I don’t want to help you but that I’m not sure what kind of trial awaits us there.

“However, I can confirm that this is something left behind by the sect founder. Regardless of whether we succeed or not, it’s an honor for all of us to be here. We’ll be the first ones since the founding of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to cultivate inside the Hidden Dragon Illusory Palace,” Chu Feng said.

“The first ones? Indeed, I don’t think that I’ve heard of the Hidden Dragon Illusory Palace before... Doesn’t that mean that we’re actually quite formidable?”

“Junior Chu Feng, this is all thanks to you!”

While Chu Feng didn’t really offer them much help here, they were still excited to know that they were the first batch of disciples in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to enter this place, and it filled their hearts with gratitude.

This was indeed a huge honor, something that they could most definitely boast about in the future.

“There’s no need to thank me. We’re fellow disciples from the same sect after all. It’s just that there’s something I do need your help on,” Chu Feng said.

“Junior Chu Feng, feel free to speak.”

Chu Feng waved his sleeves grandly.

Shoosh!

The Hellking’s sculpture glowed brightly, producing balls of light that darted out from the sculpture and into the disciples’ bodies. Before anyone could make sense of what the balls of light were, they had already dived right into their hearts, fusing as one with them.

However, what was worth mentioning was that Li Muzhi, Ma Yueyue, Zhao Shi, and the others who were on closer terms with Chu Feng weren’t ‘attacked’ by the balls of light.

“Junior Chu Feng, what’s this?” Song Qian asked with a deep frown.

Even though she saw the ball of light darting into her body, she couldn’t feel its existence anywhere in her. However, her intuition told her that the ball of light meant nothing good at all.

“Senior Song, you’re all witnesses of the events that transpired today. I was the one who cleared the Cleansing and opened the Hidden Dragon Illusory Palace. I don’t demand anything from the rest of you, and I don’t expect you to pay me back either. I just hope that you can spread the word about everything that has happened here honestly lest I get slandered.

“I don’t really care much about the accomplishment and everything else, but I just don’t want to be cursed by others despite having done a good deed here.”

Chu Feng specially shot a glance at Zuoqiu Yanliang after saying those words.

Everyone immediately understood what Chu Feng’s words meant. Chu Feng was simply afraid that Zuoqiu Yanliang would distort the truth and attempt to frame Chu Feng so as to get back at him.

However, as long as the crowd reported the matter honestly, it would become apparent who was at the right and who was at the wrong here. Given so, Zuoqiu Yanliang would be at a loss as to how he should deal with Chu Feng.

In other words, Chu Feng was just leaving an additional layer of insurance here so as to ensure that no one would backstab him after the matter was over. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Junior Chu Feng, we aren’t despicable individuals who would betray our benefactor. We’ll reveal what we witnessed today truthfully without any falsehoods. However, I would just like to know what the balls of light that just entered our bodies are,” Song Qian asked once more.

“Senior Song, know a person’s face but not his heart. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but I prefer to always have an additional layer of guarantee, especially when it comes to something as important as this,” Chu Feng replied.

“What do you mean by that? Just get straight to the point!” Song Qian’s tone was getting more and more hostile.

“It’s very simple. I’ve planted a seed of power from the Hellking into your bodies. Even after I lose control of the Hellking’s power after leaving this place, I’d still be able to trigger the seed of power to take your lives. As long as you reveal everything truthfully, nothing will happen. However, if someone gets blinded by whatever and tries to distort the truth to pin false accusations on me, I’ll make sure that he dies a horrible death!” Chu Feng said.

“You bastard! Chu Feng, how dare you use such means to threaten me?!” Song Qian flew into a state of rage.

While the other disciples didn’t say anything at all, their complexions still turned incredibly awful. Chu Feng did have his own reasons for doing this, but the feeling of having their hands grasped in the hands of another was simply awful.

“Senior Song, why are you getting so agitated? Like I’ve said, as long you reveal whatever you have witnessed today truthfully, I won’t make things hard for you. It can’t be that...”

Chu Feng’s eyes suddenly narrowed as a biting coldness suddenly glazed over his eyes.

“... Senior Song, are you intending to do me harm?”
