Chapter 3300 - Astonished Look

While the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder appeared to be very anxious and wanted to urgently report the matter to their clan chief, he suddenly stopped after only taking several steps.

He turned around and looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, “Brother Chu, let’s go together.”

“If I’m going, he’ll have to accompany me,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said with a smile. He was naturally talking about Chu Feng, who stood beside him.

He knew that the location where the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was at was not a place where ordinary people could enter.

An Ancient Era’s remnant like the one that they were trying to open was truly a forbidden area.

Whilst he had the qualifications to enter and meet up with the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen might not necessarily feel that Chu Feng possessed those qualifications too.

“Brother Chu, I hope you do not take offense to what I’m about to say. A venue like an Ancient Era’s remnant is truly not a place where that young friend can enter. However, someone brought over by Brother Chu is our clan’s honored guest.”

“Come, let’s go. Our clan chief will definitely be very happy to see you,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said.

Hearing what the Supreme Elder said, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smile changed slightly. He was rather satisfied with this response. After all, it would mean that the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder was giving him sufficient face.

That said, as the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder did not ask about it, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief also did not bother to mention it either.

He felt that it was meaningless to deliberately emphasize Chu Feng’s identity. Even if that Supreme Elder were to find out about Chu Feng’s identity, he still would not necessarily think highly of him.

As such, what the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was waiting for was the glimmer of gold. As for Chu Feng... he was not only gold in his eyes, but he was extraordinary gold.

He was waiting for Chu Feng to shine. At that time, everyone would have to face Chu Feng squarely, and think highly of him from the bottoms of their hearts.

Being guided by the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder, Chu Feng not only arrived deep in the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range together with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, but he also saw the so-called Ancient Era’s remnant.

A portion of the Ancient Era’s remnant had emerged from within the continuous mountain range.

That portion was merely the tip of the iceberg. However, although it might be the tip of the iceberg, it extended continuously for several thousand miles.

Vast constructions extend for several thousand miles. Those buildings were made from white stones. Although they did not shine golden or bright, they were still incomparably spectacular to witness, and appeared to be the work of gods.

This was especially true with the overwhelming aura from the Ancient Era present on the buildings. Sensing that aura, one would began to revere this place.

At the same time, this Ancient Era’s remnant also had an irresistible enticement toward martial cultivators.

There were definitely treasures inside. Likely, those treasures would be left behind by the cultivators of the Ancient Era.

Unfortunately, although the crowd all longed to enter the remnant, there was a spirit formation separating the remnant from them, rendering them unable to enter the remnant at all.

If one wanted to enter the remnant, one must first breach the spirit formation.

Because of that, there was an enormous and majestic formation in the sky across from the vast palace complex.

That grand spirit formation was an unsealing formation. It was precisely established for the sake of deciphering and unsealing the defensive formation around the Ancient Era’s remnant.

At that moment, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the Li Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder Li Taiyi, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s eldest disciple Liangqiu Chengfeng, as well as other elders from various other powers, were all inside the grand unsealing formation’s formation core.

They were going all-out to activate the grand unsealing formation to unseal the defensive formation around the Ancient Era’s remnant.

Unless the people inside the formation core came out of their own accord, no one would dare to go in and disturb them.

Thus, after Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief arrived, they could only do one thing -- wait. They could only wait for Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others to come out on their own, so that they could inform them about the matter with Su Rou and Su Mei.

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to observe the grand formation at close range. He raised his head to the grand formation and revealed a serious expression. Unable to hep himself, he exclaimed, “That’s the ability of a Saint-cloak World Spiritist?”

Although Chu Feng was already a Snake-mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, and possessed world spirit power admired by the great majority of the people in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, there was still an enormous disparity between him and Saint-cloak World Spiritists.

Saint level spirit power. Feeling that sort of enormous aura, Chu Feng began to yearn to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

However, he was not envious of Saint-cloak World Spiritists. The reason for that was because he was very confident that he would one day become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist himself. Furthermore, the Saint-cloak World Spiritist level would definitely not be the destination of his journey as a world spiritist.

His goal was God-cloak.

Merely, there were likely not any God-cloak World Spiritists in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. In fact, it was unknown if there were any God-cloak World Spiritist in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.

After all, God-cloak was the highest realm that world spiritists could attain.

Even though Chu Feng firmly believed that he would be able to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, that did not stop him from earnestly observing that Saint-cloak spirit formation.

Perhaps it would be able to bring him unexpected benefits.

Although Chu Feng and the others outside were unable to see through the grand formation, the people inside the grand formation were able to see Chu Feng and the others.

Actually, at that moment, the people inside the grand formation were not operating the grand formation. Instead, they were resting. Because of that, they were able to to clearly see the arrival of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Feng.

“Never would I have expected brother Chu to come here.”

“Truly the heavens are helping us. Brother Chu’s strength cannot be looked down upon. Should he come in here, he will definitely increase our strength.”

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief revealed a joyous expression upon seeing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. It could be seen that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief really did seem to have a good relationship.

“If we are to allow him to come in, how are we to allocate the treasures here?”

“Besides, he’s not that powerful anyways. Even if he were to join us, he wouldn’t make much of a difference. That holds true the other way around too. Thus, what use is there in calling him in here?”

However, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s suggestion was immediately met with objections from others. All of them did not wish for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to join them.

“How to allocate the treasures? Didn’t we say that the amount of treasures we’ll obtain will depend on our own abilities?”

“For you all to refuse to allow the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to come in, it’s likely because you all are afraid of having another competitor, no?” Right at that moment, a female’s voice was heard.

The people present were all old monsters that had lived for close to ten thousand years. That woman however, was the only exception to that case. She was actually someone who was not even a thousand years old.

In fact, she was not even two hundred years old. Yet, her cultivation was that of a rank two Exalted.

As for that woman, she was naturally the former strongest Ancestral Martial Decastar, the Li Heavenly Clan’s genius girl, Li Ruochu.

Li Ruochu was a beautiful woman. When placed amongst that group of old monsters, she appeared to be particularly attractive.

Most importantly, even though she was a person of the younger generation, she emitted an extraordinary air that was not at all inferior to that of those old monsters around her.

“Li Ruochu, if the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan are to come here, it will actually not affect us much. Merely, I’m afraid that it would be extremely detrimental to your Li Heavenly Clan, no?” Someone immediately said to Li Ruochu in a mocking tone.

“What do you mean by that? How come I can’t understand you?” Li Ruochu asked with a beaming smile.

“We have all heard about the situation between your Li Heavenly Clan and their Chu Heavenly Clan.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Since you’re pretending to be confused, you can consider that I never mentioned it,” The person who had spoken earlier shook his head. However, he took a glance at the grey-haired old man who stood beside Li Ruochu.

That glance of his contained deep implications. The reason for that was because of the grey-haired old man who stood beside Li Ruochu was the Li Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder, Li Taiyi.

That gaze of his was a gaze trying to incite disharmony. He wanted Li Taiyi to control Li Ruochu’s behavior.

However, the result of his attempt disappointed him. Li Taiyi reacted as if he did not see his gaze, and directly ignored him.

“That young man seems to be quite interested in our spirit formation,” Suddenly, a man in the grand formation spoke.

That man had a head of black hair tied into a knot on the top of his head. He wore a white gown and gave off a very refined air, as if he weren’t a mortal.

His appearance was only that of a middle-aged man. However, he was someone who had lived for over seven thousand years.

After he spoke, everyone in the spirit formation turned their gazes to Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because that middle-aged looking man was Grandmaster Liangqiu’s eldest disciple, the Saint-cloak World Spiritist Liangqiu Chengfeng.

Liangqiu Chengfeng’s words grasped the attention of the crowd. With him looking at Chu Feng, everyone else would naturally also look to Chu Feng to try to see what was so special about him.

After examining Chu Feng, someone said, “That young man seems to be slightly familiar-looking.”

At that moment, the deep gaze of Li Taiyi had changed slightly. Compared to the others, he seemed to have recognized Chu Feng. It was precisely because of that that he ended up having a change in his gaze, revealing... a trace of hostility.

“Of course he’s familiar-looking. That young man’s origin is quite extraordinary,” Li Ruochu said.

“Oh? It seems like Miss Rouchu knows who he is?” Someone asked.

“That man is Chu Xuanyuan’s son, Chu Feng,” Li Ruochu said.

“Chu Feng?” Hearing those words, the grand characters present all revealed an obvious change in their expressions.

It was a look of astonishment.
