Chapter 3616 - Unexpected Discovery

“Fuck, I never would have believed that.”

“We actually really managed to come out safely.”

“They really didn’t attack you.”

“Brother Chu Feng, how did you know that they would not try to make things difficult for you?”

Upon discovering that they were truly safe after exiting the Tantai Heavenly Clan, Kong Tianhui was finally unable to contain himself.

Even though they were still in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, Kong Tianhui felt that they were already completely safe from the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

Chu Feng smiled lightly at Kong Tianhui’s question. “It’s very simple, they were the ones in the wrong.”

“Ah? Merely because of that?” Kong Tianhui asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng said.

“With how powerful they are, don’t they always oppress others?”

“Why would they decide to spare you just because they were the ones in the wrong?”

“This is simply not their style, no?”

“Say, brother Chu Feng, what are you doing? Why are you ignoring me?”

Kong Tianhui grew very enthusiastic as he continued to speak. However, he suddenly discovered that Chu Feng was not only ignoring him, but his gaze was also focused elsewhere. Furthermore, his gaze was shifting. It was like he had discovered something.

However, when Kong Tianhui followed Chu Feng’s gaze, he was unable to find anything.

“Brother Chu Feng, what did you see?” Kong Tianhui asked.

“Ssshh, don’t talk right now.”

Chu Feng’s gaze had changed somewhat when he said those words. He had activated his Heaven’s Eyes.

Originally, Chu Feng was unable to be certain. However, upon activating his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to clearly see a stream of power moving about in the distance.

That was not some sort of living organism. Instead, it seemed more like an abnormal sign caused by some sort of existence...

“Never would I have imagined that such a treasure is hidden outside the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s territory.”

Chu Feng revealed a look of joy. Then, he said to Kong Tianhui, “Follow me.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng began to chase after that hidden abnormal sign.

Although Kong Tianhui was confused by Chu Feng’s behavior, he did not hesitate, and followed closely behind him after seeing his serious look.

At the same time, Chu Feng said to Yu Sha within his world spirit space, “Miss Yu Sha, it’s your lucky day.”

Yu Sha, the female world spirit that had become Chu Feng’s world spirit because of Xue Ji, was a habitually silent girl.

Everything that Chu Feng had experienced during this period of time was actually vivid in her mind.

It could be said that she was experiencing Chu Feng’s trials and tribulations together with him.

However, even when faced with death, she did not utter a single word.

When Chu Feng didn’t speak to her, she did not speak to him either. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“What do you want?” Yu Sha’s voice was heard. Her voice was very pleasant-sounding. However, it was also very cold.

“I’ve discovered an abnormal sign. We should be able to find something good by following it.”

“If my judgement is correct, what we’ll discover should be a natural oddity, a cultivation treasure.”

“However, this cultivation treasure will not have any use for me. Instead, it will be useful for you,” said Chu Feng.

“It’s a natural oddity that only world spirits can use?”

“Such a thing exists in your world?”

Yu Sha revealed an interested look upon learning that it was something that could be used to train.

“Such a natural oddity is very rare. Earlier, I was uncertain if that was it. However, after approaching it, I’ve become even more confident that it should be a natural oddity that can help world spirits.”

“These Heaven’s Eyes of mine will not deceive me.”

“Earlier, it was all thanks to you that I was able to contend against that Linghu Hongfei. You have helped me enormously. Thus, I owe you a favor.”

“I'm going to return this favor today,” said Chu Feng.

“I’ve already said that we are mutually helping one another, and there’s no need to mention anything about favors,” said Yu Sha.

“Haha. Okay,” Chu Feng smiled.

Kong Tianhui was finally unable to contain himself again, and asked Chu Feng curiously, “Brother Chu Feng, exactly what are you chasing? How come I’m unable to see anything?”

It wasn’t that he didn’t try to make his own inspections. It was merely that he was unable to see anything.

After all, his world spirit techniques were not at Chu Feng’s level. As for his observational abilities, they could not compare to Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes.

Chu Feng did not conceal the matter from Kong Tianhui. He told him what he had said to Yu Sha earlier.

“My goodness, brother Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. You actually managed to discover such an obscure natural oddity.”

“Brother Chu Feng, you’ve decided to travel such an enormous distance all so that you can help me put on a facade.”

“I, Kong Tianhui, will firmly remember this favor from you. Thus, you can rest assured, since you are interested in that natural oddity, I, Kong Tianhui, will help you obtain it, even if I am to climb a mountain of blades or descend into a sea of flames,” Kong Tianhui vowed.

“Very well,” Chu Feng nodded. However, he knew that one could not obtain that natural oddity with brute force. Instead, he would have to rely on his world spirit techniques.

Soon, Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui went underground.

After passing through multiple layers of earth, after travelling deeper and deeper underground, the two of them finally reached a vast cave.

No, to be exact, that place could not be considered to a cave anymore.

It was simply too enormous. One could very well describe it as an underground world.

Before entering the cave, Kong Tianhui was unable to sense anything.

However, once the two of them had entered the cave, even Kong Tianhui was able to sense the intense aura. Sure enough, that was the aura emitted by a natural oddity.

“My goodness, brother Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. You actually managed to discover such an obscure natural oddity,” Kong Tianhui exclaimed with admiration.

Chu Feng was startled to hear those words. He looked to Kong Tianhui and asked, “Didn’t you say those words earlier?”

“Ah, that’s right, I said it before,” Kong Tianhui nodded.

Then, with a grin on his face, he said, “Earlier, I was pretending to be amazed so that I could flatter you. I didn't expect you to really manage to find such a natural oddity. Thus, my shock right now is real. I am feeling admiration for you from the bottom of my heart.”

“The hell,” Chu Feng rolled his eyes at Kong Tianhui.

“Brother Chu Feng, I am truly excited. You’re actually very lucky to discover a natural oddity like this. Furthermore, judging from the aura, this natural oddity is quite something.”

“Most importantly, you discovered this outside the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s territory. You’re simply seizing food from the entrance of the tiger’s den.”

“This is simply too exciting!”

“Oh, that’s right. Brother Chu Feng, where should we go now? This place is too big, no?” Kong Tianhui asked.

“Quiet down. Don't alert anyone. As for where to go, you merely need to follow me,” said Chu Feng.

“Okay, I’ll do as you say. You’re my big brother now. I’m your little brother. I'll listen to everything you say and follow your orders,” Kong Tianhui said with a grin.

Kong Tianhui was not feeling any fear from encountering the unknown. Instead, he became particularly excited. It was like he was playing around.

Seeing Kong Tianhui like that, Chu Feng felt helpless. “Forget about it. It’s better that I set up a concealment formation. Otherwise, with how much you talk, our tracks will sooner or later be exposed.”

Chu Feng immediately did as he said. After he finished saying those words, he immediately set up a concealment formation that covered Kong Tianhui and himself.

Then, Chu Feng began to survey his surroundings with his Heaven’s Eyes. Soon, he determined the direction in which the natural oddity was located.

At the beginning, the underground world was rather normal. However, as Chu Feng went deeper, he saw that it was no longer normal.

The previously pitch-black underground world started to emit a faint green light. A pulsing sound similar to a heartbeat could also be heard.

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

The deeper they went, the stronger that pulsing sound became. Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui’s hearts involuntarily began to pulse with that sound.

In the beginning, Kong Tianhui was extremely excited, and showed no trace of fear.

However, at that moment, the smile on his face had disappeared. Not only did he have a serious look, but there was even fear in his eyes.
