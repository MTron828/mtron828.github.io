Chapter 2103 - Two Hopes

Darkness and light began to interweave with one another. A vortex of light and darkness was formed. The energy of the vortex began to wreak havoc through the world, destroying everything in its path.

The battle between the Moon Immortal and the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was truly infinitely close to being able to cause the destruction of the entire world.

To the people of the Holy Land of Martialism, something like this was simply unprecedented.

Logically, no one should be able to approach the battlefield. However, there were several hundreds of millions of people observing the battle.

THe Elf King, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, Xian Miaomiao and the others were all here. Even the Compass Immortal was here.

The reason why they were able to observe the battle at such a close range and not be affected by it was because they were in the Transmogrification Gate.

In fact, it was not a coincidence that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master and the Moon Immortal were fighting in this place. Although it was very unimaginable, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had discovered the Transmogrification Gate through special means.

Most frighteningly, not only did the Dark Hall’s Hall Master find the Transmogrification Gate, he also possessed the means to breach the Transmogrification Gate.

His five clones all contained special power that could break the indestructable and undiscoverable Transmogrification Gate.

Fortunately, the Moon Immortal had made a timely arrival. Else, the Transmogrification Gate would’ve definitely been breached by the Dark Hall’s Hall Master. At that time, the several hundred million people that were hiding in the Transmogrification Gate would definitely have been killed by the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.

“Is that the legendary Moon Immortal? That Moon Immortal that has been hidden in the Moonlight Maze the entire time? Never would I have expected the Moon Immortal to be two beautiful young women.”

“Fool! That is Lady Moon Immortal! Don’t you spout such blasphemy!”

“Yes, yes, yes.”

“Lady Moon Immortal is so powerful. As expected from a Half Martial Ancestor-level expert. The Dark Hall’s Hall Master will not be able to escape from this. We are saved.”

Practically no one among the hundreds of millions of people were able to clearly see the battle between the Dark Hall’s Hall Master and the Moon Immortal.

Thus, they could only speculate in their excitement, and determine how powerful the two fighters were from the energy ripples wreaking havoc through their surroundings.

At that moment, it was the Moon Immortal with her Ancestral-level martial power that held the upper hand. The Ancestral-level martial power that she controlled was radiating bright light all around. It was like a sword of justice that cut down the darkness in this area, bringing hope and light to the crowd.

However, the Elf King was frowning. Contained within his deep gaze was unease.

His uneasy gaze was not locked onto the battle in the sky, the battle between the Moon Immortal and the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s five clones.

Instead, his uneasy gaze was locked onto the Dark Hall’s Hall Master that was sitting on the ground with his eyes closed like he had fallen into a deep sleep.

“So you’ve also noticed it,” The Heaven Reaching Immortal arrived beside the Elf King.

“The Dark Hall’s Hall Master is extremely confident in himself. I keep feeling that something is amiss. Yet, I am unable to make out much of anything. You’re a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, are you able to determine anything from this?”

“Although I do not wish to admit it, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s world spirit techniques surpass my own. I am unable to determine anything either,” The Heaven Reaching Immortal said.

“How could that be?” Hearing those words, the Elf King’s frown grew even more tense. After all, the Heaven Reaching Immortal was the number one world spiritist in the Holy Land of Martialism. If even he could not make anything of the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s actions, then the Dark Hall’s Hall Master would truly be too powerful.

“It is precisely because I am unable to see through anything that it’s fishy,” The Heaven Reaching Immortal said.

“What do you mean by that?” The Elf King asked.

The Heaven Reaching Immortal did not speak of what he had in mind, and instead asked the Elf King, “Those five clones of his were not formed with spirit power. Instead, they contain some sort of special power, a power that could break my Transmogrification Gate.”

“Although I do not know where he obtained that power, it remains that he obtained that power.”

“However... his actual body is covered with a layer of spirit formations that even I cannot see through.”

“Why would he cover his body with a layer of spirit formations for no reason?”

“There must be a secret that he’s trying to hide,” The Elf King said.

“That’s right. He is deliberately hiding something. Unfortunately, even if we managed to discover it, there is nothing that we can do.”

“Right now, we can only resign ourselves to fate, and place all of our hopes on the Moon Immortal,” The Heaven Reaching Immortal sighed.

They were existences standing at the apex of the Holy Land of Martialism. However, in this battle that concerned the future of the Holy Land of Martialism, they were unable to do anything. Naturally, they would feel very depressed.

“No, we still have another hope,” The Elf King said.

“You’re talking about Chu Feng?” The Heaven Reaching Immortal asked.

“Mn,” The Elf King nodded.

“I’ve heard from that Compass Immortal that the spatial crack Chu Feng went through was a vicious type that contained all sorts of danger. The possibility of Chu Feng being able to pass through that spatial crack is extremely small.”

“Even if he really managed to pass through it, he might not necessarily be able to obtain Qing Xuantian’s inheritance. After all, none of us know what the remnant Qing Xuantian left behind is like.”

“Furthermore, even if Chu Feng really managed to obtain Qing Xuantian’s inheritance, he might not necessarily be able to take care of the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.”

“Although we can still place a trace of hope in Chu Feng, it must remain only a trace of hope. Compared to the Moon Immortal, our hope in Chu Feng is truly too uncertain.”

“Unless a miracle is to happen...” The Heaven Reaching Immortal said.

“Heh...” The Elf King laughed lightly. He then said, “It seems that you do not know Chu Feng well.”

“Oh?” The Heaven Reaching Immortal looked to the Elf King. There was a trace of curiosity in his eyes.

“The way I see it, that boy Chu Feng is precisely someone who makes miracles,” The Elf King said confidently.

His confidence was not baseless. Although he could not be said to have known Chu Feng for a very long time, it was not a short time either. He had personally seen Chu Feng accomplishing many impossible things.

“Let’s hope that to be the case,” The Heaven Reaching Immortal smiled. As matters stood, they had reached the moment of a life and death crisis. How could he not wish for there to be someone to save them like Qing Xuantian did back then?

If it were possible, he also wished for that person to be Chu Feng.

Merely... he truly felt that it was already too late.

“Rumble, rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, the rumbling from the sky grew more and more ear-piercing. Even though everyone was in the Transmogrification Gate, they were still able to sense how frightening the outside was. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Not to mention others, even the strongest people in the Transmogrification Gate, the Elf King and the Heaven Reaching Immortal, would only be courting death should they try to enter that battle.

After fighting for some time, the Moon Immortal unleashed her Imperial Armament. The Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s five clones had also unleashed their Imperial Armaments; the five of them each held an Imperial Armament in their hands.

Although the Moon Immortal was fighting one against five, she still remained extremely calm and unphased. With the assistance of her Imperial Armament, she maintained absolute superiority in their battle.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, the Imperial Armament the Moon Immortal held let out a ray of light. Like a flash of lightning, it shot toward one of the five clones.

“Roar~~~”

Everything happened too quickly. That clone simply did not have time to dodge. It let out a frightening snarl, and then its body shattered into pieces.

The Moon Immortal had killed that clone with a single strike!!!

“Not bad.”

Seemingly sensing that one of his clones had been destroyed, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master, who had appeared to be sleeping the entire time, abruptly opened his eyes and looked to the Moon Immortal up above him.

Merely, even though he clearly knew that one of his clones had been destroyed, there was no worry in his gaze. Instead, his gaze emitted a different sort of implication.
