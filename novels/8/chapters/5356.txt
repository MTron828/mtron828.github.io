Chapter 5356: The Person Who Defeated Bai Yunqing

“Why do you look so excited?” Chu Feng asked.

“Big brother Chu Feng, are you not excited at all? We’re going to undergo the trial together with the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion! They represent the pinnacle of world spiritist techniques in the entire world of cultivation!” Bai Yunqing replied.

He switched to voice transmission before continuing on, “Don’t you think that it’ll be exhilarating if we do manage to outdo them?”

He didn’t want the old woman, who was also from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, to hear those words.

“It would indeed be exhilarating,” Chu Feng replied, though he figured that Bai Yunqing wouldn’t understand what he was actually getting at.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had imprisoned his mother because they thought that his birth was a humiliation to them. The thought of him trampling all of the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion under his feet filled him with a rush of adrenaline.

Naturally, he was also excited at the opportunity to test the waters here.

The old woman led them to the place where the juniors were gathered.

“Why are there outsiders here?”

The juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion noticed their arrival and directed hostile gazes over.

“The two of them will be participating in the trial together with the rest of you,” the old woman said.

“Elder, they aren’t from the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion, right? What rights do they have to participate in the trial together with us?” Some of the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion vehemently spoke up against it. 

Chu Feng was annoyed by the way they were assessing him from head to toe. He had seen plenty of arrogant people who were full of it, but these gazes from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s juniors irked him the most. It was almost as if they thought that they were royalty standing before peasants. They acted as if Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing didn’t even have the right to share the same space as them, let alone participate in the trial.

“That is Lord Shuang Yu’s order,” the old woman said.

“Lord Shuang Yu?”

As much as the juniors opposed the decision, the voices of dissonance lessened upon hearing that. Lord Shuang Yu was none other than that black-haired middle-aged woman, and it was clear that she wielded considerable standing and authority in the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion.

Otherwise, the conceited juniors of the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion wouldn’t have shut their mouths after learning that it was her order.

Just then, three figures, two women and one man, flew down from the sky. They were all juniors, but they were fairly powerful world spiritists. The two women were at Gray Dragon God-cloak whereas the man was at Blue Dragon God-cloak.

The fact that the man was standing in front of the two women highlighted his extraordinary background. 

“It’s him?” Bai Yunqing frowned upon seeing that man.

“It’s young master Jie Yu!”

The arrogant juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion excitedly called out that man’s name. Some of the women even shrieked in delight. It was a completely different attitude from how they reacted to Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing’s arrival.

“Isn’t that Bai Yunqing? What brings you here?” Jie Yu noticed Bai Yunqing and asked.

“Young master Jie Yu, Lord Shuang Yu has arranged for the two of them to participate in the trial,” the old woman explained once again.

“What? Two outsiders are going to participate in the trial together with us? This is ridiculous! Young master Jie Yu, why don’t you have a talk with Lord Shuang Yu about this? I don’t want to undergo the trial together with an outsider.”

“Yeah, that’s really uncomfortable,” the two women beside young master Jie Yu complained coyly.

“You shouldn’t look down on him. Do you know who he is?” Jie Yu looked at Bai Yunqing as he spoke.

The two women and the juniors present reassessed Bai Yunqing upon hearing those words.

“Who is he? I don’t know him,” one of the women beside Jie Yu asked.

“He is Bai Yunqing, the disciple of Taishi Xingzhong, Totem Dragon Clan’s First Guest Elder,” Jie Yu answered.

“Oh. Taishi Xingzhong. I have heard about him before. This fellow here is his disciple?”

That made the juniors present see Bai Yunqing in a different light.

“Uweh! I’m about to puke. Are these people from the sacred land of world spiritists? They act as if they are from a noble lineage when all they have is a big tree to lean on. Just wait till they find out that a successor of the Ruler’s Bloodline is standing right in front of them!” Eggy grumbled. 

She hated it when Chu Feng was looked down on by others. In her view, these people were the real trash. 

“Eggy, you need not pay them any heed. It'd be beneath us to stoop down to their level,” Chu Feng said.

He had long gotten past the phase where he would lose his temper just because a bunch of clowns looked down on him. He merely found their attitude laughable. They were acting like bigshots now, but it was only a matter of time before he trampled the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion under his feet.

“Bai Yunqing, welcome to our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s trial. Shall we compete this time around too?” Jie Yu walked up to Bai Yunqing and asked.

“What shall we compete on?” Bai Yunqing asked. His complexion looked a little awful.

“Let’s see who scores better for the trial,” Jie Yu replied. 

“This is your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s trial. You have probably been through it many times now. Don’t you think that it’s unfair to propose such a challenge?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Are you afraid? Don’t you want to win against me at least once? Or do you intend to stay beneath me for your entire life?” Jie Yu asked with narrowed eyes. 

Chu Feng’s eyes turned cold upon hearing those words. He finally understood why Bai Yunqing had such an awful look on his face. 

At the same time, the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had their curiosity piqued. They swarmed around Jie Yu and asked about the matter.

“Young master Jie Yu, you have crossed blows with him before?”

“Mmhm, I met him together with Taishi Xingzhong in a remnant and challenged him to a duel of world spiritist techniques,” Jie Yu replied.

“Young master Jie Yu, how do his world spiritist techniques compare to yours?” 

“Don’t look down on him. He’s not weak either,” Jie Yu replied with a smile. It sounded as if he was complimenting Bai Yunqing, but those words were an indirect compliment toward himself. After all, he was the winner of that duel.

“Elder, when does the trial begin?” Not wanting to deal with Jie Yu, Bai Yunqing turned to the old woman.

“What’s the rush? It’ll open when the time comes,” the old woman replied with a hostile attitude. She had changed her attitude after realizing that Jie Yu wasn’t too fond of Bai Yunqing.

“Bai Yunqing, I’ve been keeping this with me all this while. Don’t you want to get it back?” Jie Yu said as he took out a child’s longevity pendant.  

There was nothing special about the longevity pendant, but Bai Yunqing’s face turned grim upon seeing it.

“How do you want to compete?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Good, it looks like you remember this item. As I have told you, we’ll compete on the results of this trial. I shan’t take advantage of you. I won’t ask anything of you if I win, but I’ll return this pendant to you if you lose. Sounds good?” Jie Yu asked.

“Fine.” Bai Yunqing accepted the challenge.

Jie Yu’s lips curled up in glee.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng spoke up, “That sounds meaningless.”

“Who are you?” Jie Yu asked.

“This is my big brother, Chu Feng,” Bai Yunqing replied.

“Your big brother? You’re Taishi Xingzhong’s disciple too?” Jie Yu asked.

“No, he’s my sworn big brother,” Bai Yunqing replied.

“You’re Chu Feng, right? You said that our challenge sounds meaningless. What do you propose then?” Jie Yu asked.

“What’s fun about the two of you competing with each other? Why don’t we form teams and pit it out instead? I’ll be in a team with Bai Yunqing, and the rest of you will be on the other team. We’ll compete on our overall result,” Chu Feng replied.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jie Yu didn’t take the offer right away. He knew how powerful Bai Yunqing was, and a person whom Bai Yunqing willingly called ‘big brother’ was likely to be formidable too. He was confident about taking down Bai Yunqing on a 1-on-1 challenge, but he wasn’t sure if his peers would pull him down in a group challenge.

“What’s wrong? Are you afraid? Are you worried that your peers will drag you down?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

Jie Yu frowned. 

That was indeed what he was thinking, but he didn’t think that Chu Feng would actually voice it aloud. What would the other juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion think about him when they learned about it? Wasn’t Chu Feng intentionally making things difficult for him?
