Chapter 3593 - A Desolate Land

“Clan Chief Chu, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan has been revived, and their clan chief even became an Utmost Exalted. This is no small matter. I must quickly return to my clan and report this matter so that we can prepare for them. Because of that, I will be taking my leave now.”

“Clan Chief Chu, we have gained quite a harvest on our journey to the Void Sacred Tree. It’s all thanks to young friend Chu Feng that we were able to gain such profits. We will firmly remember everything that young friend Chu Feng has done for us.”

The people from the various powers all arrived before the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to bid their farewells.

After experiencing all those things in the Void Sacred Tree, and with Chu Feng’s safety being undetermined, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was in no mood to continue to entertain those people. Thus, it suited him well when they said that they were planning to leave.

“Brother Chu, I am truly sorry. This old man failed to discipline the young, and allowed my clansmen to commit a massive blunder. On behalf of my clan, I hereby apologize to you,” Tantai Yinjian brought the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen with him, arrived before the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and bowed to him.

“Let us not mention the things of the past anymore. After all, those that have committed the blunders have all paid the price,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Right. The past is not important. What’s important is the future.”

“This old man sincerely hopes that all the unpleasantries of the past will not affect future interactions between our two clans,” Tantai Yinjian said with a very sincere expression.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was startled upon hearing those words.

After all, even a fool could tell that he was trying to reconcile with him.

But he was Tantai Yinjian of all people. He represented the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

A power like the Tantai Heavenly Clan, an existence like Tantai Yinjian. Hadn’t they always oppressed others?

Why would Tantai Yinjian and the Tantai Heavenly Clan set aside their high posture and seek to reconcile with him even after experiencing such unpleasantries?

Chu Feng. It was most definitely because of Chu Feng.

After a short period of shock, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief thought of the reason for this sudden behavior.

It was because of Chu Feng that the Tantai Heavenly Clan and the various other powers had traveled all the way to Chu Heavenly Clan.

It was also due to Chu Feng that the crowd were able to safely return from the Void Sacred Tree.

Chu Feng’s talent was clearly visible to everyone...

That said, this time around, the crowd had managed to witness Chu Feng’s character, in addition to his talent.

It was no wonder the Tantai Heavenly Clan would treat the Chu Heavenly Clan with such friendliness even after the unpleasantries that had happened between them.

After a short bidding of farewells, the people from the various powers all left.

Only the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm remained. As they looked to where the Void Sacred Tree was previously, complicated emotions filled their hearts.

After all, to other people, what disappeared was only a sacred cultivation ground.

However, to the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, what disappeared was a Sacred Vestige that belonged to them.

The crowd did not have much attachment to the Void Sacred Tree when it was still present.

It was only when it disappeared that the crowd realized how precious it was.

From this point onward, there would no longer be one such sacred cultivation ground.

To future generations, this was even more lamentable. They would not even have the opportunity to witness the Void Sacred Tree. To them, the Void Sacred Tree would become a legend, only spoken of by their seniors...

“Lord Clan Chief, do you think Chu Feng might have been captured by the Blood-devouring Demon Clan?” Chu Xuanzhengfa arrived beside the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He had a very worried look on his face. His concern for Chu Feng was not at all inferior to that of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I’d rather hope that Chu Feng has been captured by the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief. After all, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief does not appear to be that bad of a man,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I feel the same.”

“Our interactions with them made me change my impression of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan.”

“Lord Clan Chief, you’re someone that interacted with the Blood-devouring Demon Clan from back then. Were they truly a clan that committed all sorts of evil?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Back then, although the Blood-devouring Demon Clan was known as a demon clan, they never oppressed anyone. Compared to the people that flaunt themselves as righteous powers, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan did a lot more righteous things.”

“As for the rumors that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan were refining others to increase their cultivation, they only started spreading after the war began.”

“Thus, it is not impossible for the Blood-devouring Demon Clan to have been wrongly accused,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said those things through voice transmission.

After all, the entire starfield was under the rule of the Starfield Master Realm.

If he were to publicly state that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan might have been wrongly accused, it would be a sign of public opposition to the Starfield Master Realm.

Chu Xuanzhengfa sighed. “If that’s the case, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan and the Starfield Master Realm will inevitably wage war against one another. However... the Linghu Heavenly Clan is also restless.”

“With a situation like this, it is truly not peaceful.”

War between the Starfield Master Realm and the Linghu Heavenly Clan was unavoidable.

Once the war began, various powers would definitely join in. The war was destined to envelop the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would not be able to remain peaceful either.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was worried that their Chu Heavenly Clan would be drawn into a battle that was originally unrelated to them, and end up sustaining needless casualties.

“If it’s a blessing, it will not be a disaster. If it’s a disaster, one will not be able to avoid it,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Lord Clan Chief, what are we to do now?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“You’ll return first. I will stay here and wait awhile. Perhaps... I’ll be able to find a trace of Chu Feng,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Lord Clan Chief, I also wish to stay here and wait for a bit. May I stay to accompany you?” asked Chu Xuanzhengfa.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief took a glance at Chu Xuanzhengfa. Logically, as the Vice Hall Master of the Law Enforcement Hall, Chu Xuanzhengfa shouldered a heavy responsibility, and had a lot of official business he needed to attend to. He should not be staying here.

However, seeing the worry-filled look on Chu Xuanzhengfa’s face, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded to indicate to him that he could stay.

............

Chu Feng had naturally not disappeared.

At the same time, he was also not captured by the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

When the crowd were forcibly removed from the Sacred Palace Hall by the Void Sacred Tree’s powers, Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were also removed from the Sacred Palace Hall.

At that moment, Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen found themselves together. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

They were all in an unknown place.

Desolate. That place was not only desolate, but it was also very strange...

The earth was pitch-black like ink, and the sky was dark. Most importantly, the surrounding mountains, rivers and trees were all bald.

Such a desolate sight was present as far as the eye could see with no end to be seen. It was as if the entire world was desolate.

Being in that sort of desolate world, one would feel stifled.

That said, what Chu Feng was concerned about was not where they were.

Instead, he was thinking about something.

Earlier, regardless of whether it might be when he was in the darkness, in the Sacred Palace Hall or in the forest, he was able to feel the aura of the Void Sacred Tree...

However, just a while ago, Chu Feng felt the aura of the Void Sacred Tree disappear.

Chu Feng was extremely baffled by it.

Thus, he was unable to even be certain if the desolate land was still within the Void Sacred Tree or not.
