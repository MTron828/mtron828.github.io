Chapter 4086 - Demonization

“Chu Feng is actually this powerful?!”

While the scene before their eyes was something that the crowd had anticipated to be possible, they still felt disbelief upon witnessing it.

While they knew that Chu Feng possessed overwhelming battle power, they did not expect it to really be so strong that even the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master going all-out would not be a match for him.

He was able to defeat the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master’s rank two Exalted Taboo Martial Skill using only his world spirit techniques.

“Damn it!”

At that moment, the person who felt the most complicated would be none other than the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

The Exalted Taboo: Purple Lightning Attachment was his strongest technique.

If even that was unable to defeat Chu Feng...

Then not only would he be killed, but his Constellation Immortal Isle would also be wiped out.

Thinking of that, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master revealed a look of determination.

“You all! Quickly, leave this place!” He looked at his subordinates that had hidden themselves far away.

“Lord Isle Master, could you be...?!”

Seeing the look in their Isle Master’s eyes, they suddenly realized something.

“Lord Isle Master, you absolutely mustn’t!”

“Lord Isle Master, if the green mountain remains, there’s no need to fear for a lack of firewood. You mustn’t take this step!”

The people from the Constellation Immortal Isle began to plead tearfully.

“Scram now!”

“If you still don’t scram, I’ll slaughter you all!” the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master shouted angrily.

His killing intent actually enveloped the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle.

He was not joking around. If his subordinates refused to leave, he would really kill them.

Seeing that, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle, although they were unwilling, did not hesitate to choose their lives when given the choice between their lives and their loyalty.

Because of that, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle all began to flee further away.

After his subordinates fled, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master finally turned his gaze to Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, to be able to force this old man into this state, you have some skills.”

“However, it’s all going to end now. That said, before your death, I can allow you to die with understanding,” said the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

“Oh? What are you trying to say?” asked Chu Feng.

“I said that I’ll wipe out your Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, I will definitely wipe out your Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Thus, you don’t have to feel sad after you die; your clansmen will soon go down to join you.”

After the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master finished saying those words, he flipped his palm, and a black stone appeared in his hand.

Seeing that stone, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

Chu Feng stopped holding back, and began to focus his all to control the giant light dragon and make it attack the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

Chu Feng noticed that the stone was no small matter.

Whilst that stone was not a forbidden medicine, it possessed a power akin to a forbidden medicine. Merely, the power it contained was much stronger than that of a forbidden medicine.

Chu Feng felt that the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master had taken out that stone at this impasse because he wanted to put forth a final life and death struggle against him.

Chu Feng didn’t know exactly what sort of power the black stone possessed.

But, to prevent the unexpected, he felt the need to strike preemptively, and not give the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master the opportunity to use the black stone.

But, when Chu Feng attempted to erase the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master with his giant dragon of light, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master’s giant lightning dragon tangled itself onto Chu Feng’s giant light dragon.

Even though the light dragon held absolute superiority over the lightning dragon, eliminating the lightning dragon was not something that could be done in a short period of time.

While all of this was happening, a ‘snap’ was heard. The Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master had crushed the stone in his hand.

The shattered stone then turned into dark black gaseous flames that revolved around his hand.

Then, with a deep breath, the black gaseous flames were sucked into the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master’s mouth.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

Once the black gaseous flames entered his body, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master began to scream miserably.

His current appearance was simply tragic to look at.

His skin was disintegrating. His face began to rip. It was those black gaseous flames. The black flames were erupting from his body, destroying it in the process.

Soon, the black flames began to fuse together, and actually restored the appearance of the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

Merely, the current Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master was three times the size he was before.

Not only that, but his body was still enveloped by black gaseous flames. Even his eyes had turned pitch-black.

He no longer resembled a human. Instead, he looked more like a demon.

“Could that be one of the Constellation Immortal Isle’s strongest techniques, the Constellation Immortal Technique’s apex realm, Demonization?!”

“In other words, the stone fragment he absorbed earlier was the item that could allow him to attain Demonization?!”

Someone cried out in alarm.

“That’s Demonization?”

The crowd were all greatly alarmed upon hearing those words.

The Constellation Immortal Isle’s Constellation Immortal Technique was a very powerful mysterious technique.

It was through the use of his Constellation Immortal Technique that the Isle Master was able to gain such strong battle power.

It was also because of his Constellation Immortal Technique that he could defeat the six overlords. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, the Constellation Immortal Technique he trained in had only reached the master level, and not the apex level.

There were two different sorts of apex levels for the Constellation Immortal Technique. They were Immortalization and Demonization.

In the entire history of the Constellation Immortal Isle, only their first Isle Master had ever managed to master the Constellation Immortal Technique to the Immortalization state.

After him, no one else had been able to reach Immortalization.

That said, a few had managed to reach Demonization.

Being one of the two apex forms of the Constellation Immortal Technique, the power of Demonization was actually a bit stronger than Immortalization.

The only difference between them was that Immortalization was something that one needed to train to obtain. Unless one possessed sufficient talent, it was impossible to reach Immortalization.

However, it was different for Demonization.

Demonization was not an apex that could be trained toward. Instead, one needed to use special medicines to obtain it.

However, that special medicine was even fiercer than forbidden medicines.

Whilst the backlash from forbidden medicines was very strong, one could find ways to lessen or completely stop it.

However, if one were to take the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Demonization medicine, then whilst it would be possible for the user to obtain Demonization temporarily, they would ultimately die.

Originally, the crowd did not understand why the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master would swallow the crushed stone.

However, they now understood the reason why. Seeing his current appearance, everyone knew what had happened.

The stone must be the Constellation Immortal Isle’s medicine that could allow one to obtain Demonization.

It was no wonder the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master had ordered his subordinates to withdraw from this place, but was met with such unwillingness.

Evidently, they knew what the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master was planning to do.

Truth was, the crowd could understand why the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master would do such a thing.

Chu Feng was simply too strong. He was so strong that the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master was unable to defeat him even with a rank two Exalted Taboo.

Chu Feng was determined to kill him. Thus, this left the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master with no choice. He had to either win, or die.

Even though using the medicine to obtain Demonization would ultimately result in his death, he would at least be able to kill Chu Feng before he died.
