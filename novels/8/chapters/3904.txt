Chapter 3904 - Generational Family Treasure

“Gou Zhen is a lackey of Gou Yukuang.”

“My grandfather, father and mother were all killed by Gou Yukuang.”

“If I am to become Gou Zhen’s lackey, it would be akin to becoming my enemy’s lackey.”

“Although I, Gou Za, am a coward, and afraid of death, I am unwilling to do that sort of thing even if being killed is the alternative,” said Gou Za.

“So that’s the case. In that case, you’re still quite brave. I your daddy have a whole new level of respect for you,” with a smile on his face, Chu Feng patted Gou Za’s shoulder.

“Milord, please don’t mock this lowly one,” Gou Za acted embarrassingly. However, it could be seen that he still felt joyous and proud from being praised by Chu Feng.

“Do you need me to help you take care of that Gou Yukuang?” asked Chu Feng.

“No, Milord, please don’t,” Gou Za immediately turned tense after hearing those words.

“What’s wrong? Don’t you want to avenge your grandfather and parents?” asked Chu Feng.

“I do, of course I do. Even in my dreams I think of avenging them.”

“However, I want to kill Gou Yukuang personally. I do not want to borrow help from others.”

“If Milord is to kill him for me, it would not be me having avenged my grandfather and parents,” said Gou Za.

“That’s true,” Chu Feng nodded. He felt what Gou Za said to be very reasonable.

“In that case, take these.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a Cosmos Sack and tossed it to Gou Za.

“Milord, what is this?”

Although Gou Za and others had utensils for storing items, they were different from Cosmos Sacks. Thus, it was his first time seeing a Cosmos Sack.

“Let me teach you how to use it.”

Chu Feng began to teach Gou Za how to use the Cosmos Sack.

“Heavens! This... Milord, this lowly one couldn’t possibly accept this, I couldn’t possibly accept this.”

After opening the Cosmos Sack, Gou Za immediately pushed it back to Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had placed a lot of cultivation resources in the Cosmos Sack.

Although those cultivation resources were not very helpful for him, they were simply priceless treasures for Gou Za.

The was the reason for Gou Za’s intense reaction. He simply did not dare to accept those cultivation resources.

“If you do, accept them.”

Chu Feng tossed the Cosmos Sack back to Gou Za.

“Milord, I...”

After accepting the Cosmos Sack again, Gou Za was slightly hesitant.

Evidently, Chu Feng’s words had incentivized him.

Indeed, he needed to avenge his parents and grandfather. In the martial cultivation world, cultivation resources were indispensable. No matter how talented one might be, one’s future prospects would still be limited without sufficient resources.

If Gou Za were to rely solely on himself, he might not be able to get revenge in his entire life.

The cultivation resources Chu Feng had presented him had provided him an opportunity.

In fact, the instant he saw the cultivation resources, he saw the opportunity to get revenge.

“Remember, do not sell these cultivation resources. In fact, do not show them to anyone. You can only use them yourself. In fact, you must even keep that sack well-hidden. Do not let anyone see it.”

“Otherwise... it might bring forth the danger of death upon you. Even your grandmother will not be able to escape from it,” Chu Feng warned Gou Za in a very serious manner.

The reason why Chu Feng warned Gou Za like that was naturally because his cultivation resources and Cosmos Sack were all things that were not present in their world.

Chu Feng’s cultivation resources belonged to his era, whereas the cultivation resources of the Galewind Hunting Clan were, evidently, still a continuation of the Ancient Era.

“Milord, please rest assured. I will definitely safekeep everything.”

Gou Za was very prudent. As he spoke, he immediately and carefully put away the Cosmos Sack Chu Feng had given him.

“It’s about time for me to leave,” as Chu Feng spoke, he stood up with the intention to leave.

“Milord, please wait.”

However, right after Chu Feng stood up, Gou Za’s grandmother suddenly arrived beside him.

“Milord, it is all thanks to you today. If it wasn’t for you, Gou Za and myself would both have been killed.”

“We people from the Dog Clan are all very poor. Thus, there’s nothing much I can use to repay you for your grace.”

“This here is our family’s generational treasure. It is something passed on by our ancestors.”

“Milord, you must definitely accept it.”

As Gou Za’s grandmother spoke, she took out a piece of paper and handed it to Chu Feng.

That paper was the same paper she had given Gou Zhen earlier, only to have Gou Zhen rip it to shreds.

Merely, after Chu Feng massacred Gou Zhen and his lackeys, Gou Za’s grandmother gathered up the paper fragments and reassembled them.

Chu Feng casually accepted the paper. After accepting the paper, he didn’t know what to say.

It emitted an intense Ancient Era’s aura. This meant that the paper was something from the Ancient Era.

However, apart from the fact that it was something from the Ancient Era, the paper did not have any other redeeming qualities.

Firstly, the paper itself was very frail. That was evident by how Gou Zhen was able to easily tear it to pieces.

On the paper was an animal. That animal was very ugly. Furthermore, one simply could not make out what that animal was.

It resembled a child’s scribble.

Most importantly, the piece of paper had been torn to pieces who-knew-how many times.

In other words, the piece of paper Gou Zhen had torn to pieces was in itself an already torn paper.

The paper had been torn apart and reassembled multiple times.

Likely, Gou Za’s grandmother had taken out the paper stating that it was a treasure multiple times. Unfortunately, it seemed like she had only enraged those people more.

Even though the paper had been torn apart multiple times, Gou Za’s grandmother continued to reassemble it.

Actually, Chu Feng could understand those people tearing apart the paper. After all, even he, with his Heaven’s Eyes, was unable to determine what was special about the paper even after careful inspection.

That paper was indeed nothing more than trash.

“Milord, you must definitely keep it safe.”

“That is an Ancient Era’s secret skill. As we possess mediocre aptitudes, we are unable to comprehend it. However, with how gifted Milord is, you will definitely be able to comprehend it,” said Gou Za’s grandmother.

“Very well,” as Chu Feng spoke, he planned to put the paper into his Cosmos Sack.

“Milord, don’t put it away like that. You must place it on your chest. It must be stuck to your skin.”

“The reason for that is because the secret skill has its own intelligence,” said Gou Za’s grandmother.

At that moment, Chu Feng felt rather helpless. It was nothing more than a piece of trash paper, yet he needed to go through so much trouble.

However, for the sake of making Gou Za’s grandmother happy, he decided to place the paper inside his clothes and on his chest.

“Buzz~~~”

The instant the paper came in contact with Chu Feng’s chest, he felt a burst of pain in his chest. It seemed like something had pierced his heart.

Most importantly, Chu Feng’s surroundings began to spin rapidly. His surroundings began to turn fuzzy.

Following that, Chu Feng entered an endless vortex. He was unable to control himself, and could only follow the frantic spinning of the vortex.

Inside that vortex, he became completely confused and disoriented.

When Chu Feng broke free from the vortex, he discovered that his surroundings had changed completely.

He was no longer in Gou Za’s residence. Instead, he had entered a bizarre world.
