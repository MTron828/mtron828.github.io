Chapter 2832 - Sacred Tree Illusionary Fog

"Heavens, it’s Chu Feng? It was actually done by Chu Feng?"

"He killed Young City Master and Yuwen Hualong?!!!"

"Impossible, this is impossible."

"How did he accomplish this? How did he enter this place?"

"Could this be fake? Could it be a prank?"

At this moment, the crowd began to make all sorts of guesses. Many people felt that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to enter this place. Even if he was able to enter Yuwen City, it should be impossible for him to not be discovered.

There were even people that felt that those corpses were simply not Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong, but rather fake, a prank.

However, for experts like Yuwen Yanhong, they were able to tell with a single glance that those corpses were not fake. They were indeed his son Yuwen Tingyi and his disciple Yuwen Hualong.

"Ahhhh!!!!!!!"

"Chu Feng, I am going to dismember your body into ten thousand pieces!"

Suddenly, Yuwen Yanhong let out another furious shout. That furious shout of his shook the entire Yuwen City’s main city so violently that it began to tremble.

After shouting, Yuwen Yanhong rushed out of Yuwen City as if crazed and began to frantically search for traces of Chu Feng.

Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried to search for Chu Feng, he was unable to find any trace of him.

Chu Feng had already left long ago. At that moment, he was enroute to the Void Sacred Tree.

............

After traveling for some time, Chu Feng had grown closer and closer to the Void Sacred Tree.

Chu Feng had encountered a lot of people on the journey there. There were peak experts with unfathomable strength that flashed past Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was unable to even see the silhouettes of those experts. He was only able to sense that those experts’ overwhelmingly powerful auras had once enveloped him.

There were also large groups of men traveling in various war chariots that covered the entire sky. With their flags fluttering about, they passed beside Chu Feng majestically.

With impressive power, they considered everyone else to be beneath them. When encountering those armies, many people would hurriedly move aside out of fear of offending them.

On the journey, Chu Feng had witnessed or felt various different powerful existences.

Chu Feng knew that those people all had the same destination as he did; they were all heading for the Void Sacred Tree.

As Ma Changchun said, the unusual change that occurred to the Void Sacred Tree had indeed caused a great commotion throughout the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. People from practically all different powers were gathering at the Void Sacred Tree.

However, perhaps because Chu Feng had disguised himself as an old man, but even though Chu Feng was traveling with the cultivation of a rank four True Immortal, not a single person that passed by him bothered to pay attention to him. In fact, many among them did not even bother to take a glance at him.

Chu Feng knew very well that if he were to reveal who he really was, many people would immediately notice him.

In the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, an old man that had trained for many years would be looked down upon should they only have the cultivation of a rank four True Immortal.

However, if it was a member of the younger generation that was less than a hundred years old with the cultivation of rank four True Immortal, they would be looked upon with admiration by others.

This was the extraordinary reality of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. This reality was also very cruel.

Chu Feng was still continuing on with his journey. However, he was no longer journeying alone.

There was an old man not far from Chu Feng. That old man was journeying together with him.

That old man possessed a cultivation stronger than Chu Feng’s. He was a rank five True Immortal. However, he was not hastening his journey by going all-out. As such, his speed was practically the same as Chu Feng’s.

“Friend, are you also proceeding for the Void Sacred Tree?” That old man asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right. I’ve heard that a youngster has appeared in the Void Sacred Tree and was able to stay within it. Because of that, I’ve decided to go pay a visit” Chu Feng replied in the manner-of-speech of an old man.

“Haha, this is truly a coincidence. This old man is also proceeding toward the Void Sacred Tree for the same reason,” That old man laughed.

Just like that, Chu Feng and the old man chatted with one another while continuing on their journey to the Void Sacred Tree.

That being said, the content of their conversation was related to the Void Sacred Tree, but it was mostly the old man speaking and Chu Feng listening to him.

As they continued on with their journey, a thick fog suddenly appeared before them. At the beginning, Chu Feng did not pay much attention to the fog. However, that fog was extremely strange; it was actually able to obstruct Chu Feng’s line of sight. Even Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes were unable to see through the fog.

With the situation being like that, the distance which Chu Feng could see grew smaller and smaller.

Chu Feng realized that the situation was bad. He had a feeling that he would not be able to leave this thick fog.

At that moment, the old man journeying together with Chu Feng said with a panicky expression on his face, “Oh no, could it be that we’ve entered the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog?”

“Sacred Tree Illusory Fog? What is that?” Chu Feng asked.

“Could it be that you don’t know about the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog?” The old man was astonished at Chu Feng’s question.

“I am ignorant and inexperienced. Exactly what is that Sacred Tree Illusory Fog?” Chu Feng asked.

The old man sighed and said, “The Sacred Tree Illusory Fog is fog emitted by the Sacred Tree. This fog is capable of puzzling one’s wisdom. Upon entering it, one will be trapped in one place. It is very difficult to escape the fog.”

“In fact, there were many people that have died after being trapped within it,”

“How could they have died from being trapped?” Chu Feng was very confused.

“If this is really the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog emitted by the Sacred Tree, then we are already trapped in it. All that we’ve seen earlier were merely illusions.”

“It might be possible that you and I are lingering back and forth in a little cloud. As for that little cloud, it will be the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog.”

“Inside that cloud, all that we’re able to see is boundless fog. No matter how hard we try, we will never be able to walk out of it, as we’ll only be moving around the same area.”

“Furthermore, for the people outside, it would appear like an ordinary cloud with nothing extraordinary about it. As such, they will naturally not be able to tell that we are in the cloud.”

“The only exception would be if they ran into the cloud by accident. Should that happen, they will, like us, be trapped within this Sacred Tree Illusory Fog,” The old man explained. Then, he sighed again.

“We are truly unfortunate. This Sacred Tree Illusory Fog is akin to a legend. Very rarely would anyone encounter it. Yet, we actually ended up encountering it.”

“Could it be that this Sacred Tree Illusory Fog will not disperse?” Chu Feng asked.

“It will. One day, it will disperse. According to legends, it is only able to, at the very most, persist for several months,” The old man said.

“If that’s the case, wouldn’t it mean that we would be able to escape after several months? If that’s the case, how can one be trapped to death?” Chu Feng asked.

“It would be great if it really was that simple. The Sacred Tree Illusory Fog will unwittingly intrude into our bodies and poison our souls. At that time, we will feel time pass extremely quickly.”

“Even though only a short few hours might have passed in the actual world, we will feel as if a thousand years have already passed,” The old man said.

“Even though we will feel as if a thousand years have passed, it’s still only an illusion, no?” Chu Feng said.

“This is the amazing aspect regarding the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog.”

“It will make us feel as if everything is real. When we believe what we experience to be real, we will not be far away from death,” The old man said.

“In that case, it would mean that as long as we hold a firm conviction that everything is fake, we will be able to escape this place?” Chu Feng asked.

However, when Chu Feng said those words, he suddenly discovered that the old man that was beside him had suddenly turned imaginary.

Soon, that old man turned into mist and dissipated into thin air before Chu Feng.

“Senior? Senior?”

“Damn it, am I being affected by the illusions?”

Chu Feng realized that the situation was bad. He felt that the old man would not disappear for no reason. He felt that he might already be affected by the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog and immersed in illusions.

“Wuuu~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng felt his head feeling a bit numb. His train of thought seemed to become abnormal.

“Where is this? Why am I here?”

The next moment, Chu Feng became bewildered.

He looked to his surroundings and was unable to understand where he was.

Chu Feng seemed to have already forgotten his purpose. He seemed to have forgotten that he’d gotten caught in the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog, forgotten about that old man.

“Chu Feng, what’s wrong?!”

Seeing that Chu Feng’s reactions were amiss, Her Lady Queen started to shout at him.

However, no matter how loud she shouted, Chu Feng seemed unable to hear her voice at all.

With the situation being like that, Her Lady Queen became extremely worried. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had forgotten his memories; he was already caught in the illusion.

Her Lady Queen felt that it was very possible that Chu Feng was, as that old man had described, caught in the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog. He no longer possessed control over his awareness, and was completely affected by the illusions.

Most importantly, the Illusory Fog was even stronger than Her Lady Queen had imagined.
