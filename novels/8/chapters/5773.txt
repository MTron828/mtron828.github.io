Chapter 5773: Miaomiao In a Difficult Position

“I see,” Jie Baobao replied with a nod. “But what if the rumors are true? I mean, hypothetically speaking.”

“Huuu…” Instead of answering the question, Ling Xiao exhaled deeply before saying, “Then we should advise our family members to leave the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion.”

“Why?” Jie Baobao asked.

“Because Chu Feng will definitely destroy the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Ling Xiao said.

“Yes, you’re right.” Jie Baobao nodded.

“Let’s not think too much into it. The rumors can’t possibly be real, and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion will accept Chu Feng. Your hypothetical situation won’t come to be. Let’s go. We don’t have Chu Feng to ferry us through our trial now, so we need to be careful,” Ling Xiao said as he released his spirit power and prudently advanced.

Jie Baobao did the same too. She had felt safe when she was with Chu Feng earlier, but now that the latter was not around, she no longer felt as safe despite having Ling Xiao by her side.

…

While Jie Baobao and Ling Xiao were venturing deeper into the cavern, Chu Feng was still working on his formation. He had more trouble with the formation because he had grasped a deeper level of it.

He had been paying close attention to everything since entering this realm, fearing that he would miss out on anything. His goal was not just to be acknowledged as the strongest in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith—he wanted to conquer the Genesis Bloodline.

He grasped something deeper in the formation. He didn’t tell Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao about it not because he was selfish, but because it would be meaningless unless they could grasp it on their own.

Furthermore, to capitalize on this fortuitous encounter, they would have to decipher the formation in a special way that was demanding on one’s world spiritist technique while inflicting tremendous suffering upon one.

While Chu Feng had appeared relaxed when he bade Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao farewell with a smile, he was in great pain. It was not easy to decipher the formation while enduring such pain. As much as he didn’t want to underestimate Jie Baobao and Ling Xiao, he didn’t think they were capable of pulling it off.

And if they failed, it would be the end.

Fortunately, Chu Feng succeeded.

The sealing formation unraveled, and his surroundings dissipated into spirit power. The realm around him began to change, as the beautiful scenery was reduced to a chaotic space. At the same time, the realm also became larger, so much so that he felt as if he was standing in the midst of the world of cultivation.

A speck of light appeared in the darkness. Then more specks appeared. Each of these specks represented a realm.

Soon, they came together to form the Nine Galaxies.

Each of these Nine Galaxies was brilliant and beautiful. It was a majestic sight comprising many different realms, and they were the birthplace of countless cultivators.

Soon, nine tremendous auras boasting sizes comparable to the Nine Galaxies appeared in the world of cultivation. The other galaxies slowly became blurry to Chu Feng’s eyes, whereas the Bloodline Galaxy grew clearer as the golden aura rushed toward it.

“The Genesis Bloodline?”

Chu Feng was shocked.

This explained why Liu Kuo said what he had seen wasn’t the true form of the Genesis Bloodline. Even the golden aura that shrouded the Pulse Ignition Realm wasn’t its true form either. The Genesis Bloodline was actually a behemoth as big as the Bloodline Galaxy!

Chu Feng intently observed the movements of the Genesis Bloodline. It was like a life form, possessing its own sentience. It was also incredibly powerful.

All of a sudden, the Genesis Bloodline rushed at Chu Feng and enveloped him.

It was so violent that Chu Feng found himself in unbearable pain. His body was soon destroyed, and cracks appeared in his soul. Yet, all he could do was clench his teeth and tolerate all of it. As he held on with his exceptional pain tolerance, his soul and body finally began to regenerate.

This granted him a chance to carefully examine his surroundings. He tried using his Heaven’s Eyes and other observation means, but he couldn’t discern anything.

“This doesn’t seem to be a tempering,” Chu Feng murmured as he walked forward.

The golden aura further intensified as he advanced, but Chu Feng forced himself to adapt and marched onward. It didn’t take long before his consciousness started to fade under the onslaught of the violent golden aura, but he continued marching by sheer instinct.

He didn’t know how long he marched for, but he persevered on through sheer willpower. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You’re qualified,” echoed the voice suddenly.

It was powerful enough to resonate across the entire world of cultivation. Under this deafening voice, Chu Feng immediately regained consciousness.

He looked over and saw an incomparably huge silhouette comparable to a starfield standing at the center of the golden aura.

Following that, the ocean of golden aura began flowing into his body. It didn’t feel violent anymore, and it didn’t cause him any suffering either. It peacefully flowed into his body as if it was nothing at all.

By the time Chu Feng took in all of the golden aura, he was stunned to realize he had returned to the small realm, where he had worked with Jie Baobao and Ling Xiao. His surroundings were the same as before.

However, there were two things in front of him—a spirit formation key and a mirror.

The spirit formation key fell into Chu Feng’s hand. He quickly stowed it away, knowing that there would be a use for it later on.

As for the mirror, it contained many screens reflecting different scenes. Through these screens, Chu Feng could see what was happening throughout the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

Little Fishy, Xianhai Shaoyu, and Feng Ling were paired together. They were currently closest to the ending point of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

Huangfu Shengyu, Huangfu Jiangyao, and Huangfu Shangyang were not together with Little Fishy and the others, but they were in the same realm. From the directions they were traveling, it was likely that they would eventually cross paths.

Ling Xiao and Jie Baonbao were busy breaching a formation. They were behind Little Fishy and Huangfu Shengyu, but the gap wasn’t very big.

The only one who was truly in trouble was Xian Miaomiao.
