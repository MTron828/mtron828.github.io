Chapter 4165 - Bear The Consequences

“Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, are you serious?”

They looked to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted and questioned him for confirmation.

After all, this matter was simply too shocking to them.

Originally, they’d already given up on fighting for the Dragon Vein Source Stones after they split up with Long Daozhi. They felt that they were incapable of finding any on their own.

In fact, it was merely a coincidence that they were there.

Never did they imagine that they would encounter Chu Feng there.

More than that, the thought of Chu Feng having Dragon Vein Source Stone on him had simply never crossed their minds.

If this was true, wouldn’t it mean that they’d encountered an enormous bargain?

“Absolutely true!”

“It’s in his possession,” said the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

“Enough with the bullshit, let’s have him hand it over to us. If he refuses, we’ll kill him and search for it ourselves,” said one of the four leaders fiercely.

His words immediately obtained the others’ approval.

With that, eight gazes landed on Chu Feng.

Their gazes had all changed.

Whilst they had been looking at Chu Feng with ill-intent before, perhaps because they were afraid of Long Daozhi, they did not possess any killing intent.

However, the situation had changed. They were thinking about killing Chu Feng now.

Chu Feng could clearly sense their killing intentions.

“Trying to plunder something from me? You dare?”

However, Chu Feng showed no fear towards the people that had the intentions of killing him.

Instead, he scoffed at them and laughed mockingly.

“Brat, don’t you act arrogant.”

“While your world spirit techniques might be powerful, it’s impossible for you to be our match without Long Daozhi backing you up.”

“Hand over the Dragon Vein Source Stone and we will let you live. Else... we’ll end your life,” said the four leaders fiercely.

Although that was what they said, Chu Feng could tell that their murderous desire had been raised, and they would not spare him no matter what.

The reason why they said such words was all so that they could smoothly obtain the Dragon Vein Source Stone from him.

After all, they all knew the abilities of world spiritists. If Chu Feng refused to hand over the Dragon Vein Source Stone, it would be impossible for them to find it even if they were to kill him.

That said, Chu Feng was not afraid of them either.

“Who did you think I am? If you dare touch me, I’ll have your entire clan be buried with me.”

After saying those words, lightning surged forth and transformed his entire body.

Seeing the change that had occurred to Chu Feng, the four leaders, the four world spiritists and even the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted all revealed looks of shock.

A Divine level Lightning Mark was illuminating Chu Feng’s forehead.

Surging Lightning Armor covered his body.

Most importantly, there were four gaseous flames around him. The four gaseous flames were not only emitting the roars of ferocious beasts, but one could even vaguely see the outlines of four Divine Beasts.

They could tell that it was a Divine Power.

Being able to unlock one’s Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor at the Utmost Exalted realm was already incredible.

But on top of possessing such a powerful Heavenly Bloodline, Chu Feng also possessed a Divine Power.

That was simply completely unheard of.

Moreover, Chu Feng was already so heaven-defyingly talented with his world spirit techniques. Thus, how could it be possible for his talent in martial cultivation to also be that terrifying?

Furthermore, they felt like Chu Feng’s talent in martial cultivation was even more terrifying than his talent in world spirit techniques.

They were able to sense that the young man standing before them, someone less than a hundred years of age, was emitting the aura of a rank four Utmost Exalted.

He was only a level of cultivation inferior to them!

“You... exactly what sort of monster are you?!”

“Exactly who are you?!”

The four leaders and the four world spiritists whose faces were filled with murderous desires toward Chu Feng were now all sweating profusely.

An unconcealable fear was present on their faces.

They could guess that this youngster by the name of Chu Feng was not only someone with exceptional talent, but he was most definitely also someone with an extraordinary identity.

How could a youngster with this sort of talent be an ordinary individual?

He was most likely not from the Ancestral Martial Starfield. The Ancestral Martial Starfield couldn’t possibly produce a genius of such caliber.

He was most definitely a genius from some colossal power.

Although he was a person of the younger generation, he was someone that they could not afford to offend.

“Clank~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng revealed his Incomplete Exalted Armament.

Lightning was actually flowing faintly through the Incomplete Exalted Armament.

Even though the lightning was very vague, it was extremely tyrannical. It was a very terrifying type of lightning.

After revealing his Incomplete Exalted Armament, Chu Feng’s gaze turned sharp.

“If you all are to pull back now, I can let bygones be bygones.”

“Else, you shall have to bear the consequences,” said Chu Feng.

“This...”

The four leaders and four world spiritists all became speechless.

They were all frightened by Chu Feng’s imposing might. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Sensing that the situation was turning bad, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted began to shout, “Don’t listen to him! This child is vicious and merciless! If you all are to spare him, he will definitely not let you live!”

“He simply has no backing at all! He’s bluffing! I was deceived by him back then too!”

“Think about it! If his identity were truly that extraordinary, why would he be in a place like this?! Why would he risk his life for a mere Dragon Vein Source Stone?!”

“Kill him now! Else, none of you will...”

“Puu~~~”

However, before he could finish his sentence, a muffled explosion was heard.

Looking over, they could see that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s soul had shattered. He had been killed.

Naturally, it was Chu Feng who had killed him.

“You talk too much.” Chu Feng took an indifferent glance at where the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had been.

Then, he looked to the eight people and asked with an indifferent tone, “Do the eight of you also wish to die?”

He asked that question very casually. Yet, it was filled with threat.

“Enough with your scams. What the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted said is correct. Regardless of whether or not you possess backing, we’ve already revealed our murderous desire towards you. Someone like you will definitely not let us get away with it.”

“Everyone, let’s not bother talking rubbish with this brat anymore. Let’s directly kill him.”

“Else, if we are to spare him today, even if he does not possess any backing, with his talent, he will still cause us no end of trouble,” the old lady said loudly.

After saying those words, the four leaders all released their rank five Utmost Exalted auras and overwhelming killing intent.

That said, even though they’d decided to kill Chu Feng and had unleashed their killing intent, none of them were actually attacking him.

In the end, they were still afraid.

They did not wish to push things to the extreme. None of them wanted to be the person that killed Chu Feng.

However, facing the four rank five Utmost Exalteds, Chu Feng showed no signs of fear.

Lightning was not only instinctively surging through his Incomplete Exalted Armament, but also squirming all over his body.

It was only because of the Lightning Armor that no one noticed the squirming lightning.

If one were to notice the lightning attached to Chu Feng’s body and weapon, they’d realize that it was extremely terrifying.

“Everyone, let us not drag this out anymore. If this is to continue, nothing good will come for any of us. Let’s attack him at the same time instead.”

Seeing that the other three were also unwilling to attack, the old lady, feeling helpless, spoke again to urge them.

After she spoke, the three other leaders also nodded.

They also knew that an unforeseen event might occur if they continued to drag out the exchange. Instead of scheming against one another, it was better that they deal with Chu Feng quickly.

“Chu Feng, do not blame us for being ruthless. If you want to blame someone, then blame yourself. You shouldn’t have obtained that Dragon Vein Source Stone.”

After saying those words, the four leaders shot their oppressive mights to attack Chu Feng.

“Puu~~~”

“Puu~~~”

“Puu~~~”

......

However, before they could actually attack Chu Feng, eight muffled sounds sounded in succession.

In an instant, the four leaders and four world spiritists had all turned ashen. Endless fear and unease filled their eyes.

They were shocked to discover the muffled sounds had come from their bodies.

Looking down, they could see that a bloody hole had appeared in each of their bodies.

The holes were located where their dantians should be!

All eight of their dantians had been pierced!
