Chapter 4663: The Enraged Wretched Black Demon

“You’re right. There’s indeed something amiss here. Just where in the world did that old man teleport you to?” Eggy asked.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng used the Heaven’s Eye to peer beyond the cavern, and he found that it was yet another cavern outside.

A cavern in a cavern; all in all, there were 18 stacks of caverns, each inside the other. Each cavern had its own individual formation, and the eighteen individual formations came together to form a complete compound formation.

The formation which Chu Feng was in was the very last one.

The other 17 formations outside had already been activated; this was the very last one that had yet been activated. Once it was activated, this compound formation would be complete.

This formation appeared to be the kind of smelting formation that served to forge natural treasures together to form cultivation resources.

Chu Feng had also managed to find the forged cultivation resource too; it was located in the seventeenth formation.

So, he quickly made his way out to the seventeenth formation, which was basically the cavern outside, and he soon found himself faced with a cultivation resource that had been forged painstakingly over many years.

This cultivation resource looked like an irregular stone. It was glowing lightly, and it emanated a chilling coldness. The cultivation resources hadn’t been completely formed, so it couldn’t be used for cultivation just yet. To assimilate it, the cultivation resource would have to be further processed first.

However, this processing required the eighteenth formation to be activated, and on top of that, it had to be forged for around a decade before it was finally ready to be consumed. Naturally, Chu Feng didn’t have time to wait that long.

“It’s no wonder why the elder placed this teleportation formation in my body. It looks like he wishes to help me by giving me this cultivation resource. Since it’s the goodwill of the elder, I naturally can’t let him down,” Chu Feng remarked with a smile.

He reached out and stowed away the cultivation resource that was still in the midst of forging.

Weng!

Weng!

Weng!

Weng!

...

Right after Chu Feng stowed away the treasure, the radiance in the cavern began to dim. The formation in the cavern had stopped operating.

Not only so, but the formations in the other sixteen caverns had also come to a halt too.

“Why did the formation stop? Did something happen?”

Chu Feng used his Heaven’s Eye to peer through to the very end of the eighteen caverns, and he saw six elders anxiously entering the cavern, rushing his way.

They were the subordinates of the Wretched Black Demon.

“Heh...”

Chu Feng didn’t lose his nerves because of the abrupt situation. Instead, with a grand wave of his sleeves, he left behind a few characters before activating the teleportation formation in his body to leave the area.

The six elders advanced forward very quickly, but by the time they arrived at the heart of the formations, Chu Feng was already nowhere to be seen. All that was left were Chu Feng’s words.

“It was actually stolen! What do we do? That’s the cultivation resource that Lord Black Demon has specially prepared for Miss Yulin! We’ll be beheaded for failing to guard it properly!”

Upon seeing the words, the faces of the six elders paled as cold sweat dripped down their backs. They realized that they were in a very bad position.

“Run. We need to get away right now!”

Four of them immediately turned tail and fled right away upon realizing that they were in dire circumstances. Only two of them remained on the spot. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“No, we can’t run. There’s no way we could possibly escape from Lord Black Demon’s grasp. We should report the matter to him honestly, and perhaps, we might still stand a chance.”

After a swift exchange of looks, the two of them decided the report the matter to the Wretched Black Demon.

...

At the same time, the Wretched Black Demon had also managed to open the golden box, but what he was seeking wasn’t in it. Instead, there were only several words left behind for him.

He, who breaches this formation, is a fool.

“Gongsun Yuntian, what’s going on here?”

The Wretched Black Demon looked at Gongsun Yuntian furiously. His eyes were so angry that it looked as if he would swallow Gongsun Yuntian whole.

“Lord Black Demon, it wasn’t me! I wasn’t the one who did it! I’ll be honest with you! From the moment I stepped into the Asura Graveyard, I was already captured by Chu Feng. I have completely no idea what he went through!

“He was the one who gave the box to me. He lied to me, saying that he doesn’t wish to marry your granddaughter, so he wanted to give this opportunity to me. I was too naive, that’s why I took his word for granted. I didn’t know he was trying to set me up!”

“Lord Black Demon, I know my mistake now, but this was all done by Chu Feng! It has nothing to do with me!”

Gongsun Yuntian kneeled on the floor as he explained the situation desperately.

However, those words hardly alleviated the Wretched Black Demon’s rage at all.

“You useless fool! What’s the use of keeping you alive?”

The Wretched Black Demon clenched with teeth in rage. With a strike of his palm, Gongsun Yuntian’s soul immediately dissipated, and his body was reduced to a veil of blood mist.

“Trash! You’re all trash! I spent so many years devising this plan, but this trash ruined everything!”

The Wretched Black Demon shook his clenched fists as his rampaging energies flurried within the hall like a furious storm. His face looked so fierce that anyone who stood before him would subconsciously tremble in fear. Even a demon wouldn’t have been more terrifying than him.

“Milord, bad news!”

It was then that two elders suddenly shouted from the entrance of the hall.

The hall was made out of a special means that prevented those who were outside from seeing or hearing anything inside, but those who were inside could hear whatever that was going on outside clearly.

The Wretched Black Demon’s initial thought was to ignore those two elders because of his bad mood. But unexpectedly, upon seeing that the Wretched Black Demon wasn’t opening the doors to the hall, they began shouting loudly, “Milord, the Martial Cultivation Glacial Metal you have forged for Miss Yulin has been stolen by Chu Feng!”

“What?!”

Disbelief surfaced in the Wretched Black Demon’s eyes.

Boom!

He kicked the doors open.

“Milord, please spare our lives!”

Even before seeing the Wretched Black Demon himself, the two elders could already sense the aura he was giving off. They immediately kneeled onto the floor subserviently, not daring to move in the least.

“What did you just say? The Martial Cultivation Glacial Metal has been stolen by Chu Feng?” the Wretched Black Demon asked coldly.

“Yes, milord. It was indeed stolen by Chu Feng!”

The two elders replied with quivering voices.

“When did it happen?” the Wretched Black Demon asked.

“It happened just earlier on! As soon as we noticed it, we rushed right here to inform you of the matter. Zeng You and the other three elders were afraid of your rage, so they have run away.”

The two elders were hoping that the Wretched Black Demon would spare their lives by emphasizing their loyalty.

“Useless fools!”

Yet, the Wretched Black Demon simply waved his sleeves, and blood spurted everything. The two elders had been reduced to minced meat.

After killing the two elders, the Wretched Black Demon rose to his feet and flew toward the massive cavern where the cultivation resource was.

He was hoping to find some clues that would lead him to Chu Feng here, but to his frustration, even though he sensed Chu Feng’s aura lingering in the area, he was unable to sense where Chu Feng had gone to.

Instead, there was a line of words inscribed on the wall of the cavern. It was of the same handwriting as the one who left the message in the golden box.

My deepest gratitude to my grandson, Black Demon. I’ll make sure to use your gift well!

“Chu Feng, I’ll tear you apart!”

Seeing the words on the cavern wall, the Wretched Black Demon’s body trembled in fury. Powerful energy pulsated from his body, destroying all eighteen layers of the cavern simultaneously.

He released a furious roar that shook both heaven and earth!
