Chapter 5813: The End of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect

Chapter 5813: The End of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect

“Do you need something from me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young hero Chu Feng, it’s our first meeting but I have heard about you from Kongping. I’m truly apologetic for what happened at the Nine Souls Galaxy...”

Halfway through Jiang Jingyu’s words, Chu Feng interjected, “Let’s not harp on the past.”

However, he turned to Xian Miaomiao and said, “However, this friend of mine is from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. I won’t stop her if she intends to pursue this matter.”

Jiang Jingyu and the others stiffened up in fright.

Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan’s subsequent words made them turn pale. “Miss Miaomiao, did they offend your clan? Shall we eradicate them on your behalf?”

Those fawning words made Jiang Jingyu and the others realize that Xian Miaomiao was no pushover either.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I-I-I... T-t-this...” Jiang Jingyu looked at Chu Feng with pleading eyes, but he didn’t know how he should speak up.

“Calm down, I’ll go with Chu Feng’s decision. Since he decided not to pursue the matter, I shan’t pursue the matter either,” Xian Miaomiao said.

Chu Feng was not surprised by Xian Miaomiao’s attitude, since the Nine Souls Sacred Clan didn’t treat her well either. If the Nine Souls Sacred Clan had been important to Xian Miaomiao at all, he wouldn’t have let Jiang Yuantai and the others off back then.

“Thanks, miss... No, it should be milord. I’m grateful for your magnanimity! Thank you young hero Chu Feng for your generosity!” Jiang Jingyu quickly thanked the two of them, though his clasped hands were shaking.

“Do you need us for anything else?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I’m truly apologetic for what happened previously. I still feel bad even though you and Lord Miaomiao have chosen not to pursue the matter. I don’t know how I should compensate you.”

Jiang Jingyu reached into his pocket, where a storage formation was hidden, and pulled out a bamboo slip. It was an ordinary bamboo slip with the word ‘Starseizer’ inscribed on it.

“Lord Starseizer?” Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao’s eyes lit up.

The others were surprised too. This item was Daoist Starseizer’s possession.

Daoist Starseizer was one of the World Spiritist Immortal King’s two disciples, with the other being the incumbent Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master Jie Tianran. He was known to be skilled in prophecies, but he had left the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion many years ago due to ideological differences with Jie Tianran.

Daoist Starseizer’s whereabouts were unknown, but it should be possible to find him through his divination bamboo slip.

“You know Lord Starseizer?” Ling Xiao asked. He had examined the divination bamboo slip and confirmed it was authentic.

“I have indeed met Lord Starseizer by a stroke of coincidence. Lord Starseizer was willing to befriend me despite my humble identity, and he gifted me five of his divination bamboo slips. There’s only one left, but Lord Starseizer doesn’t mind me giving it away to others. With this, you can request a divination from him. Young hero Chu Feng, I’d like to offer this to you as compensation. What do you think?” Jiang Jingyu asked as he presented the divination bamboo slip to Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, this divination bamboo slip is authentic,” Ling Xiao said.

“I’ll accept it.” Chu Feng accepted the divination bamboo slip.

He had heard about Daoist Starseizer and his formidable divination skills. While he was skeptical about divination, he thought this was an opportunity for him to become acquainted with the latter and gather information about his mother.

After accepting the divination bamboo slip, Chu Feng entered the palace with the others.

Only after Chu Feng and the others left did Jiang Kongping and the others finally dare to speak. “Father, are you all right?”

“I’m fine,” Jiang Jingyu replied. He sat on the floor, deflated.

“Milord, they mentioned that Chu Feng is Jie Ranqing’s son. Is that true?” Jiang Taibai asked. Till now, he still found this matter unbelievable.

“Do you think it’s a lie? Can’t you see their attitudes? You should be glad you lost to him in the Eastern Region. Otherwise, we might face the same plight as Jia Lingyi.” Jiang Jingyu sighed.

“If what he said is true... is there a possibility others might come after us even if Chu Feng intends to let things slip?” Jiang Yuantai asked. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“We can only hope they’ll let us off on Daoist Starseizer’s account,” Jiang Jingyu said.

In truth, he had intentionally gifted the divination bamboo slip to Chu Feng not just to appease Chu Feng but the prodigies with him too. He noticed some of them cared deeply for Chu Feng, and he was hoping they would let him off on Daoist Starseizer’s account.

Weng!

A pillar of light suddenly rose into the sky. It was coming from the palace not too far away, and it converged with the other two pillars of light. All of a sudden, the three pillars of light vanished.

At the same time, the third palace vanished too.

Chu Feng and the others had been teleported to the point where the three pillars of light converged. Others couldn’t see them, but they could clearly see what was happening outside. Countless runes floated densely around them. These runes contained crucial information, but it was not easy to decipher them.

The area they could maneuver in was limited too. An invisible force restricted their movement.

“It looks like it won’t be easy for us to find that place,” Long Chengyu said with a sigh.

Chu Feng had previously told them that the three palaces were locks, and they should find the hidden land after deciphering them. Yet, despite having deciphered the three palaces, they were brought to this place instead.

Clearly, they had to decipher the runes to find a clue to the hidden place.

Chu Feng sat down in mid-air as he said, “It’s easy to enter the hidden land, but the crux is how much you can get out of it. Everyone, try to feel it with your heart.”

He formed a hand seal and closed his eyes. Little Fishy, Xianhai Shaoyu, Ling Xiao, and the others did the same too.

...

Meanwhile, Jia Lingyi lay in a swiftly-moving teleportation passageway. She was terribly emaciated, looking like a layer of skin cloaking a skeleton rack. Other than her faint breathing, she looked no different from a dead person. She didn’t even have the strength to move.

She had paid a heavy price to invoke the teleportation formation.

No person or treasure, no matter how powerful, could restore her spirit power. Her life as a world spiritist was over. It was a terrible price to pay for her escape, but she still did so not because she wanted to live but because she wanted to alert the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

She realized that Chu Feng was not someone their Pill Dao Immortal Sect could go against. They needed to hide and seek refuge.

All of a sudden, her surroundings changed and she crashed into the ground. She had been brought out of the teleportation formation.

“S-someone...”

Jia Lingyi lay sprawled on the ground, unable to move. Her voice was barely audible. Even so, she wasn’t worried as she had set the destination to be the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. There were guards frequently patrolling the area, so it shouldn’t take long for someone to notice her.

To her despair, no one came even though she had been shouting for some time now, though she noticed a crackling noise in the surroundings—it was the sound of blazing flames. In fact, she could feel a searing sensation slowly consuming her body.

She summoned the final sliver of her strength to raise her head, only for her eyes to widen in despair. Flames had engulfed the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Even buildings imbued with powerful defensive formations were collapsing. Burning corpses were littered all around.

The deceased were all Pill Dao Immortal Sectmembers! Someone had destroyed her sect!

“W-who did this? WHO DID THIS?!” Jia Lingyi screamed in agony.

Tak. Tak.

Footsteps echoed behind. She strained herself to look back and saw a figure walking out of the flame, headed in her direction. The flame soon receded, revealing a neatly-dressed granny with a disfigured face.

Jia Lingyi was horrified.

“You’re really alive?”
