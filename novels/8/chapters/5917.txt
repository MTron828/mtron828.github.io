Chapter 5918: Disgusting Little Sister

“Rank eight Half-God level! Has our sectmaster made a breakthrough to rank eight Half-God?”

The Sunmoon Sectmembers murmured, seemingly having forgotten the plight they were in. There was a huge gap between rank seven Half-God and rank eight Half-God, after all.

Tan Yu was even more worried when he learned that the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster had reached rank eight Half-God level.

The sectmaster noticed his worry, and that made him deduce that while the intruders had been able to breach their barrier, it was unlikely that they were a match for him. Otherwise, there should have been no reason for Tan Yu to be so nervous.

Even so, thinking that it would be better to avoid trouble, he refrained from making a move and said, “I have never met you before. There’s no grudge between us, but you destroyed our sect’s barrier as soon as you arrived. Are you here to stand up for Tan Yu? I advise the two of you to be wiser. Don’t be played like a fiddle. You don’t know how Tan Yu...”

Before he could finish his words, Chu Feng impatiently interjected, “Cut the crap and bring your grandson out.”

The Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster was startled. He thought that his cultivation should have intimidated the other party, but the other party still disregarded him. This made him realize that the other party was either out of their minds or on par with him.

The thought of that plunged him into a fluster, though he didn’t let it show on his face. Instead, he maintained a composed and even arrogant attitude and said, “Young friend, is it hard for you to understand my words when I’m talking nicely to you? Our Sunmoon Sect is not to be trifled...”

Uwa!

A powerful surge of spirit power descended from the sky, and the sectmaster plummeted to the ground. By the time the crowd realized what had happened, the sectmaster was already lying in a ditch.

“This...”

The Sunmoon Sectmembers scattered like frightening birds.

Chu Feng raised his arm and pointed his palm toward the sky. His spirit power gushed upward with a light pillar before diffusing outward.

In the blink of an eye, a massive formation sphere enveloped the entire Sunmoon Sect. This was not just a simple protective formation; it harnessed offensive means too. Chu Feng could reduce the Sunmoon Sect to flat ground with a mere thought through this formation.

“What terrifying spirit power. Is he from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

The Sunmoon Sectmembers were terrified when they saw Chu Feng’s formation.

Tan Yu was dumbfounded, but his trembling body stopped trembling. All of the reservations he harbored regarding Chu Feng’s ability were dispelled in an instant. He no longer doubted that Chu Feng had the means to avenge him.

The sectmaster knew that the situation had gone awry, so he bellowed, “Save me, old ancestor!”

Boom!

A powerful aura burst from the depths of the Sunmoon Sect. Even Chu Feng’s formation, which had enveloped the Sunmoon Sect, shattered.

“Who dares to trifle with our Sunmoon Sect?”

A white-haired man strutted across the sky with his hands behind his back. Every step he took shook the surrounding space, leaving spatial rifts in his wake.

“Is that our Sunmoon Sect’s old ancestor?”

“Our Sunmoon Sect has a pinnacle Half-God level expert?”

Both disciples and elders were surprised. Not only did the old ancestor shatter Chu Feng’s formation in an instant, but the aura he emanated was stronger than the rank eight Half-God level sectmaster.

The scattered Sunmoon Sectmembers quickly returned and stood behind the old ancestor.

At the same time, a man and a woman emerged from the Sunmoon Sect. They were both young and dressed in extravagant clothes, a sign that they were of high standing within the sect. Instead of joining the formation, they rushed toward the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster lying on the ground.

The old ancestor harrumphed at the sight of the man and the woman. He released his oppressive might to dissipate the spirit power Chu Feng was using to suppress the sectmaster.

The man and the woman quickly helped the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster to his feet.

Tan Yu’s eyes blazed with fury at the sight of the man and the woman. Chu Feng understood that those two were the sectmaster’s grandson and Tan Yu’s little sister, who had betrayed him.

The sectmaster headed over to the old ancestor’s side with the man and the woman’s support.

“Old ancestor, kill them for me. Kill them for me,” the sectmaster spat with gritted teeth while wiping off the blood on his lips.

The man and the woman glared at Tan Yu with killing intent.

“Tan Yu, I shouldn’t have pleaded for mercy on your behalf,” the woman said.

Tan Yu closed his eyes. His heart ached so much that he could hardly breathe. He had seen the woman’s true colors, but she was still his little sister, his only kin in the world!

“Do you still want to spare her?” Zi Ling asked.

She couldn’t stand watching it anymore. How could someone who betrayed their family members readily be considered kin?

Before Tan Yu could say a word, the woman sneered, “What big words! Spare me? Who do you think you are? Go take a pee and take a good look at yourself in its reflection! I’m baffled to see that people like you dare intrude in our Sunmoon Sect. You wrench, just wait and see how I’ll deal with you later!”

Tan Yu’s little sister was a crass person who could hurl insults without a second thought.

All of a sudden, she stiffened up in shock.

Chu Feng had suddenly appeared in front of her. He didn’t attack her, but just his gaze was enough to make her shiver uncontrollably.

“O-old ancestor, save me!” Tan Yu’s little sister exclaimed in horror.

“You’re courting death.”

The old ancestor swiped his old but powerful hands toward Chu Feng, but Chu Feng’s hand moved even faster and grabbed the old ancestor’s wrist. Chu Feng gripped hard, and a loud kacha sound followed.

The old ancestor winced in pain.

Chu Feng had not only snapped his wrist but also sent a pulse of spirit power rippling through the old ancestor’s body. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The old ancestor had reached pinnacle Half-God level, but he was still helpless in Chu Feng’s face.

The old ancestor felt weak. His legs caved in, and he fell to his knees before Chu Feng.

Their clash was too fast for most people to perceive, but they could still see the outcome of the clash. Their pinnacle Half-God level old ancestor was kneeling before Chu Feng with a pained look on his face!
