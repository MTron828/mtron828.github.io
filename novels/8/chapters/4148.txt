Chapter 4148 - Two People

“Good-for-nothings? Who are you calling good-for-nothings? Are you calling us good-for-nothings?!”

The four world spiritists all looked at Chu Feng. Their eyes were filled with anger and hostility.

They seemed to be warning Chu Feng that he’d best think before he spoke, or else they’d teach him a lesson.

To their surprise, even though their threats were obvious, Chu Feng completely ignored it. With a calm look on his face, he said, “Is there even a need to ask? Apart from the four of you, who else resembles good-for-nothings here?”

Chu Feng’s gaze was focused on the four world spiritists as he said those words.

Not only that, but his gaze was also filled with contempt.

It was as if Chu Feng was afraid that the four of them wouldn’t know what he was saying.

“You little trash from the Ancestral Martial Starfield dare insult us?! You’re truly courting death!”

The four world spiritists were so furious that their expressions had changed enormously.

They were able to tolerate insults if it came from the four powers’ leaders. After all, they had indeed failed four times in a row, and had let down the leaders of those four powers.

However, they were truly unable to tolerate such behavior from a brat from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

As such, they were intended to attack Chu Feng.

However, they were soon stunned. Not only were they stunned, but the leaders of the four powers and their clansmen were also stunned.

They had suddenly felt an enormous killing intent.

That killing intent was bone-chillingly cold, and extremely oppressive.

It was as if, as if the owner of that killing intent wished it they would be annihilated in the next instant.

Because of that, none of them dared to act impulsively.

After they confirmed who it was that had released the killing intent they became even more surprised.

The reason for that was because the person who had unleashed the killing intent was Long Daozhi.

Before Chu Feng’s appearance, they would’ve never imagined that the Long Daozhi from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, someone that they all looked down on, would be able to release such killing intent.

“I can ignore the bullshit you all said earlier.”

“However, if you all dare to disrespect young friend Chu Feng again, I will have your lives,” Long Daozhi narrowed his brows and spoke with a cold voice.

Seeing Long Daozhi acting in such a manner, they wanted to laugh, and even wanted to teach him a proper lesson.

After all, in their eyes Long Daozhi was nothing more than a clown.

A clown dared to speak to them in such a manner?

However, after sensing Long Daozhi’s enormous killing intent, they started hesitating.

“City Master Long, there’s no need to bother with this bunch of clowns. If they dare to spout nonsense again just kill them,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“You bas...”

Those people were flabbergasted upon hearing those words.

Chu Feng’s words were simply too arrogant.

Kill them?

Who did he think they were?

Did he really think they were trash?

This caused them to feel extremely displeased. However, they were afraid to say anything. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Even though they were unable to sense Long Daozhi’s cultivation, his killing intent was enough to cause them fear, and make them act blindly without thinking.

Seeing that everyone had shut their mouths, Chu Feng did not bother to say anything.

He turned his gaze to Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“Grandmaster, let’s join hands,” said Chu Feng.

“Okay,” Grandmaster Liangqiu immediately accepted Chu Feng’s request and arrived beside him.

“You’re actually planning to cooperate with him?”

“You’re not breaching that spirit formation at all. You’re simply trying to destroy this final chance instead,” mocked the four world spiritists.

“If you all dare attempt to breach this spirit formation, I will kill you.”

Four bursts of rank five Utmost Exalted-level oppressive might were released. They enveloped Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu.

They were from the four leaders.

“If you four dare touch them, watch and see if I don’t kill you first!” Long Daozhi’s voice exploded.

Accompanying his voice was his killing intent.

Long Daozhi’s killing intent was even more terrifying than before.

He still hadn’t released his oppressive might. He was still threatening them using only his killing intent.

However, it just so happened that his killing intent had managed to scare the four leaders again.

“Long Daozhi, what is the meaning of this? Are you trying to protect them?” asked the four leaders.

“Allow them to attempt to breach the spirit formation. If anything happens I’ll shoulder all the responsibility,” said Long Daozhi.

“Very well. Long Daozhi, if they fail to breach the spirit formation, we will settle this matter with you,” the four leaders said fiercely.

“Very well,” Long Daozhi agreed.

“How about this instead? I won’t do anything. Let’s have them attempt to breach the spirit formation instead.”

“If the four of them are capable of breaching the spirit formation, they can do it instead,” Chu Feng looked to the four world spiritists as he said those words.

“Humph. This spirit formation needs at least five people’s cooperation. How could four people possibly breach it?” said those four world spiritists.

“So you’re afraid are you? If you’re afraid then stand aside and shut up.”

“Watch carefully how we breach this spirit formation with two people.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words he looked to the four leaders.

“Earlier you all said that you’ll teach senior Long a lesson if we fail to breach this spirit formation.”

“If we do manage to breach the spirit formation, what are you all going to do then?” asked Chu Feng.

“We...”

Chu Feng’s words caused the four leaders to become speechless.

They had originally looked down on Chu Feng.

However, after seeing how confident he was they actually became worried.

‘What if this brat is really capable of breaching the spirit formation?’

‘We absolutely cannot gamble with him. Even if we are to bet against him, we cannot bet anything major. Else, if he really manages to breach the spirit formation we’ll end up suffering a major loss.’

“Why don’t you say something? You all are the ones that found those four good-for-nothings and wasted all the precious opportunities and time.”

“Yet now you’re trying to push the fault for the failure onto our heads.”

“Shouldn’t you give a statement about how you’re going to deal with this matter?”

Seeing that they’d turned quiet, Chu Feng continued to press them.

“We clearly ended up wasting four opportunities because that Liangqiu is too weak.”

“How could you be blaming us now?” refuted the four world spiritists.

“Grandmaster Liangqiu wasted the opportunities? Do you all have any proof of that?” asked Chu Feng.

“We four serve as proof,” said the four world spiritists.

Chu Feng suddenly laughed. After laughing, he looked to the four leaders and said, “Say, are the words spoken by those four sufficient as proof?”

“You all should know as to whether what they’ve said is actual proof or venomous slander, no?”

Hearing those words, the four leaders and the four world spiritists all wanted to refute Chu Feng.

However, before they could say anything, Chu Feng continued, “Firstly, you all believed that it was because of Grandmaster Liangqiu that you were unable to breach the spirit formation.”

“Secondly, you all say that this spirit formation needs at least five people to breach it, that it would be absolutely impossible for two people to breach it.”

“However, right now I am going to breach it with Grandmaster Liangqiu.”

“If we fail to breach it, I, Chu Feng, am willing to offer my head as payment” said Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you absolutely must not.”

“How could you assume responsibility for this?”

Long Daozhi and Grandmaster Liangqiu began panicking upon hearing those words. They immediately spoke to dissuade him.

After all, the attempt to breach the spirit formation had failed four times already. They all knew that the spirit formation would be very difficult to breach.

As such, they did not wish for Chu Feng to shoulder such a risk.

However, to their surprise Chu Feng stopped Long Daozhi and Grandmaster Liangqiu and indicated to them to stop with the dissuasions.

Then, he looked to the four world spiritists, “If we are to succeed, it would mean that you four were making false accusations.”

“ That the incompetent person wasn’t Grandmaster Liangqiu. Instead, it was the four of you.”

“I don’t need you all to pay with your lives. However, I need you all to kneel before Grandmaster Liangqiu and kowtow to him.”

“Then, you are to cut out your tongues,” said Chu Feng.

“What? Cut out our tongues?” The four world spiritists were all surprised to hear those words.

They were capable of tolerating the act of kneeling and kowtowing to apologize for their mistake. But cutting out their tongues would be difficult for them to accept.

After all, that would be an act of extraordinary humiliation.
