Chapter 5756: The Strongest Junior?

“It’s over, Ling Xiao,” Huangfu Jiangyao said before launching another wave of attack on Ling Xiao.

Ling Xiao’s spirit power was no longer able to protect him, as Huangfu Jiangyao’s fighting prowess had risen by another rank. Skill could only go so far in bridging a disparity in strength. Seeing that it was no longer possible for him to win the battle, Ling Xiao leaped out of the dueling ring and said, “I’ve lost.”

He returned to the ranks of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, not upset by his loss. It was as if this battle held no significance for him.

Huangfu Jiangyao wasn’t satisfied by the abrupt surrender, but since Ling Xiao had already admitted defeat, he turned around and leaped off the dueling ring. Everyone turned their sights on the white-haired man.

Four of the five Huangfus had already revealed their identities, so the last one could only be Huangfu Shengyu. Unlike the others, Huangfu Shengyu walked up the dueling ring a step at a time.

As he made his way up, he said, “The Heavenly Lightning Bloodline is also known as the Heavenly Bloodline. Many possessors of the Heavenly Bloodline can be found all over the world of cultivation, but very few people truly understand it.

“The Heavenly Bloodline can be sorted into tiers—Low-tier, Middle-tier, Upper-tier, General-tier, and Saint-tier. The average cultivators you see possess Low-tier Heavenly Bloodline, so I don’t blame your ignorance for thinking that the Heavenly Bloodline is weak. Even a Middle-tier Heavenly Bloodline is able to match the bloodline powers you are so proud of, and that’s barely scraping the surface of what the Heavenly Bloodline is capable of.

“The Upper-tier Heavenly Bloodline surpasses your bloodline powers. There are very few people in the world who possess the General-tier Heavenly Bloodline, and those people eventually become powerhouses in the world of cultivation. As for me, I possess the Saint-tier Heavenly Bloodline.”

By this point, Huangfu Shengyu had already arrived at the dueling ring, and he released his oppressive might.

“Rank seven Half-God? If he’s able to raise his cultivation by three ranks, it would mean that he has a heaven-defying battle power of one cultivation rank at rank nine Half-God level!”

The crowd was taken aback. They had known that Huangfu Shengyu was the strongest of the five, but they didn’t think that he would actually be at rank seven Half-God level. On top of that, his aura far surpassed ordinary rank seven Half-God level cultivators.

Huangfu Shengyu opened his palm, and a unique pearl floated into the air. The earlier pearls presented by the other four Huangfus boosted one’s cultivation, bloodline, or spirit power, but this one harnessed all of these powers in one.

“Naive cultivators, I shall open your eyes today and show you true strength! All of you will have a chance to challenge me today,” Huangfu Shengyu said.

The crowd exchanged glances.

The other Huangfus had revealed their strength, and Huangfu Shengyu’s bloodline power was stronger than theirs. Needless to say, he wouldn’t have any trouble manifesting the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings. Given that his base cultivation was rank seven Half-God level, who could possibly stand a chance against him?

Anyone who fought him would only embarrass themself. By this point, the crowd was convinced that Huangfu Shengyu would win the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“Who could have thought he’d be the true dark horse of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith?”

Shoosh!

Just as the crowd was feeling despair, a person leaped onto the dueling ring. It was Xianhai Shaoyu.

“I’ll play with you,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Be my guest,” Huangfu Shengyu replied nonchalantly.

As soon as Huangfu Shengyu finished his words, Xianhai Shaoyu suddenly appeared in front of him and smashed a punch toward him.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The crowd was startled. Xianhai Shaoyu hadn’t used any means to raise his cultivation rank, but the aura he emanated was already comparable to that of rank seven Half-God level cultivators.

Huangfu Shengyu was surprised by that too, but he wasn’t intimidated. He retaliated with a fist of his own.

Bam!

The two fists collided, and the two of them retreated several steps. The two of them were surprisingly equally matched.

However, Huangfu Shengyu’s complexion turned awful. He wasn’t satisfied with this outcome. Thus, he flitted forward to attack Xianhai Shaoyu, and it didn’t take long for the two of them to get entangled with each other.

It was a simple fistfight, but the shockwaves produced in their exchanges alarmed the crowd. Those who managed to enter the Nine Heavens’ Zenith were prodigies in their own rights, so they understood how amazing the fight before them was.

“As expected of Xianhai Shaoyu. He’s formidable. However, Huangfu Shengyu is no pushover either.”

Chu Feng agreed with the crowd’s analysis.

Without a doubt, Huangfu Shengyu and Xianhai Shaoyu’s fighting prowess surpassed all other prodigies who had fought before them, except for Little Fishy. Little Fishy had ended her battle so quickly that it was hard to gauge exactly how powerful she was.

While the exchanges on the dueling ring looked simple, it was the crystallization of the combat experience they had accumulated over many years. Both of them had reached the top in terms of combat sense and fighting prowess.

Chu Feng wasn’t absolutely confident of subduing them even if they were fighting at the same cultivation rank.

Tzlala!

Lightning soon crackled.

Unable to accept the fact that Xianhai Shaoyu had fought him to a standstill, Huangfu Shengyu raised his cultivation rank. Without any hesitation, Xianhai Shaoyu quickly did the same too.

This resulted in a standstill between the two of them yet again.

So, Huangfu Shengyu raised his cultivation once more, but Xianhai Shaoyu, who had been prepared for that, immediately did the same.

Before long, Huangfu Shengyu had already unleashed the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, and his fighting prowess rose to a level where he had a heaven-defying battle power of one cultivation rank beyond rank nine Half-God level.

Xianhai Shaoyu also unleashed his bloodline power thrice, so his fighting prowess remained on par with Huangfu Shengyu’s

None of the prodigies gathered around the dueling ring could see their exchanges anymore; they could only hear the commotion. This was a battle beyond their means to perceive, and this included Long Chengyu, Chu Feng, and the others.

“Elder, lend me your cultivation,” Chu Feng told the Asura King.

Chu Feng could have had the Asura King watch the battle for him, but both Xianhai Shaoyu and Huangfu Shengyu were the strongest juniors in the world of cultivation. They were the real deal. He wanted to witness this battle with his own eyes.

While he would have to deplete one of his opportunities to tap on the Asura King’s strength, he thought that witnessing this battle could be highly beneficial to his future growth as a cultivator in the future.

The Asura King did as Chu Feng requested and imbued his cultivation on him.

With the power of a True God level cultivator, Chu Feng could clearly spectate the battle between Huangfu Shengyu and Xianhai Shaoyu.

Huangfu Shengyu was wielding a lightning spear—he had retrieved this God Armament from the black wooden box behind him. This lightning spear was crafted specifically for possessors of the Heavenly Bloodline, just like Huangfu Jiangyao’s God Armament, though this lightning spear was clearly stronger.

Xianhai Shaoyu held a sword in his hand. This sword was a God Armament too.

The two of them executed simple martial skills that unleashed great devastation due to their prowess. If not for the formation imbued in the dueling ring, they would have surely destroyed huge chunks of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“Those two youngsters are formidable,” the Asura King remarked.

He had been observing the battle through Chu Feng’s eyes, allowing him to sense how strong both of them were.

“In terms of cultivation level, the two of them are indeed the strongest juniors in the present world of cultivation. Their strength is formidable,” Chu Feng complimented.
