Chapter 4159 - Enemies On A Narrow Road

Chu Feng, the old man and the youth were chatting merrily as they journeyed together.

From their conversations, Chu Feng learned their names.

The old man was called Long Busheng.

The youth was called Long Xiao.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng stopped.

They were very close to the Dragon Vein Source Stone.

But, Chu Feng detected a dangerous aura. It was a fatal aura.

“Senior, we cannot continue.”

“The two of you should part ways with me,” Chu Feng said to Long Busheng.

Before Long Busheng could say anything, his grandson Long Xiao asked hurriedly, “Benefactor, why do you say that?”

Now that the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone had been snatched away, his only hope to save his father would be obtaining the Dragon Vein Source Stone.

For Chu Feng to tell them to not follow him now, it would mean that he had extinguished the final hope that the youth had.

“It’s too dangerous ahead. It’s not safe for you two to follow me.”

“That said, your father’s illness is actually curable.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he flicked his wrist, and a stone appeared in his hand.

Upon seeing the stone, the grandfather and grandson were pleasantly surprised.

They were able to tell with a single glance that the stone in Chu Feng’s hand was the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone.

“Put it away properly. Do not allow anyone to discover it.”

Chu Feng stuffed the stone in Long Xiao’s hand as he spoke.

“Benefactor, this... what is happening?”

Long Xiao and his grandfather Long Busheng both had confused looks on their faces.

They were at a momentary loss as to what had happened.

After all, they’d witnessed with their very eyes Chu Feng tossing the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone to the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster.

Why would the stone now be in Chu Feng’s possession?

“Actually, those two from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect were deceived by me.”

“The stone I gave them was a fake. The real one was always in my possession.”

“The reason why I didn’t take it out directly is because they were too strong. I didn’t even detect them when they approached us earlier.”

“I feared that they would secretly tail us. That’s why I didn’t dare to reveal the truth.”

“However, on our journey here, I set up many probing techniques. Right now, I am certain that they did not follow us. Because of that, I am able to hand this stone to you two with ease.”

“As for the Dragon Vein Source Stones, the two of you were not interested in them to begin with. Furthermore, it is too dangerous to proceed onward. Thus, let us part ways here,” explained Chu Feng.

“Benefactor, your actions have courted a major disaster.”

“That Nine Principles Dragon Sect is not only powerful, but rumor has it that they also have an extraordinary relationship with the Dragon Clan.”

“Sooner or later they’ll discover that the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone you gave them was a fake. At that time, they will definitely not let you get away with it.”

Long Busheng’s face was covered with worry and fear as he said those words.

However, he was not worried or fearful of himself. Instead, he was worrying and afraid for Chu Feng.

He knew that there was no reason for Chu Feng to do such a thing.

The reason why Chu Feng had done that was because he had wanted to help them.

For the sake of helping them, he had offended the powerful Nine Principles Dragon Sect. The grace that Chu Feng had shown them was simply too heavy for them to shoulder.

“I’ve always been a person who dares to do what I want to do. Since I’ve done what I did, I know what sort of consequences it will entail,” Chu Feng had a smile on his face as he said those words.

Unlike Long Busheng, Chu Feng was not worried in the slightest. Instead, he was extremely relaxed.

“Benefactor, you don’t know what sort of people are in the Nine Principles Dragon Sect. They will definitely take revenge. Furthermore, they’re extremely vicious and merciless,” said Long Busheng.

“Senior, I know that they’re vicious and merciless. I also know that they’re not people to be trifled with.”

“But, must I be afraid of them and exercise tolerance whilst they bully and humiliate me just because they’re not people to be trifled with?”

“If that were the case, the weak would forever remain weak. It would be impossible for them to become strong.”

“Senior, you and Long Xiao do not have to feel any burden from this.”

“Truth is, ever since that Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster spoke rudely to me, this matter no longer concerned the two of you.”

“Ever since that moment, it became a grudge between me and the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.”

“Replacing the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone with a fake was merely my warning to them. It is merely a lesson to that Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster.”

“If they’re willing to drop this matter, I will not make things difficult for them.”

“But, if they are to seek me out to cause trouble for me, I will make them pay an even greater price.”

Chu Feng’s words sounded very much like boasting, but his face was filled with confidence.

It was as if he did not place the Nine Principles Dragon Sect in his eyes regardless of how powerful they might be.

Seeing Chu Feng like that, Long Busheng’s gaze changed enormously.

Suddenly, he took a step back and bowed respectfully towards Chu Feng.

“This old man has underestimated our benefactor.”

“Since that’s the case, this old man will not say anything more.”

“As the saying goes, an enormous grace is not something that can be repaid with words. The grace that benefactor has shown us today has been firmly engraved in the hearts of myself and my grandson.”

After saying those words, Long Busheng looked to Long Xiao. “Xiao’er, you must definitely repay our benefactor for his grace today. Understand?”

“Yes grandpa.” Long Xiao nodded repeatedly.

The grandfather and grandson did not wish to delay Chu Feng anymore, and immediately left. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After the old man and his grandson left, Chu Feng’s facial appearance immediately changed.

His appearance was not that of Chu Feng or Asura. Instead, he had taken on a completely new look.

In fact, when Long Busheng and Long Xian had first met Chu Feng, he was already wearing a disguise.

With how many experts there were in the deep abyss, even if Chu Feng was not afraid for himself, he did not wish to implicate Long Daozhi.

Because of that, for the sake of not causing trouble, Chu Feng had altered his physical appearance the moment he was separated from him.

That was also the reason why Chu Feng was not afraid of the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s retaliation.

After all, they’d only seen him with a disguise, and had no idea who he really was.

Even if they wanted to retaliate against Chu Feng, they would not know where to start.

This was especially true now that Chu Feng had altered his physical appearance again. Even if they ended up encountering him again in the vast Endless Abyss, they wouldn’t know that he was the one who had played them for a fool.

After altering his appearance, Chu Feng continued onward.

Even though the direction the Dragon Vein Source Stone was in was emitting a very dangerous aura, Chu Feng was not someone who would shrink back because of that.

In the end, he arrived at the Dragon Vein Source Stone’s location.

As he had expected, others had already arrived at the location of the Dragon Vein Source Stone before him.

Furthermore, there were quite a few people there, over twenty of them.

Upon seeing one of the individuals present, Chu Feng’s gaze grew dim and vicious.

‘This is truly what is meant by encountering one’s enemy on a narrow road,’ Chu Feng sighed in his heart upon seeing that person.
