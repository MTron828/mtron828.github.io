Chapter 4868: Ploy

“Come here, Jiahao.”

Shengguang Xuanye gestured Shengguang Jiahao over with a wave of his hand.

Despite Shengguang Jiahao’s doltish appearance, he was very obedient to Shengguang Xuanye’s words. He immediately got off his horse, rushed up to Shengguang Xuanye, and bowed respectfully.

“Come, stand beside me,” Shengguang Xuanye said.

Shengguang Jiahao quickly rose up and obediently took his position beside Shengguang Xuanye. Weirdly, he looked quite normal at this moment.

“First and foremost, I’d like to thank all of you for honoring our Holy Light Clan by traveling from far and wide to witness Shengguang Jiahao’s wedding ceremony. Your blessings will surely bring happiness and harmony to his marriage.

“I know that you all don’t know much about Shengguang Jiahao, perhaps hearing some negative rumors about him. Some of you might even think that he’s not worthy of the Dragon Clan’s Princess Xiaoxiao.”

Speaking up to this point, Shengguang Xuanye swept a glance across the crowd.

“Lord Xuanye, how could we possibly harbor such thoughts? Someone as outstanding as young master Jiahao can’t possibly be unworthy of anyone!”

“It’s Princess Xiaoxiao’s blessing to be able to marry young master Jiahao!”

“Indeed! Lord Xuanye, where did you hear those words from? Tell me, and I’ll rip that person’s mouth off!”

The crowd unhesitatingly voiced their support for the Holy Light Clan despite them knowing deep down that Shengguang Jiahoa was indeed unworthy of Long Xiaoxiao. There was no room for the truth in this present circumstance.

Shengguang Xuanye nodded in satisfaction at the crowd’s response. His gaze soon fell upon the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, which caused the latter to jolt in horror.

“Lord Xuanye, it’s Xiaoxiao’s blessing to be able to marry into the Holy Light Clan!” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief declared.

The crowd felt deeply conflicted to hear such words. Some of them felt sympathy for the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief while others only felt contempt.

However, Shengguang Xuanye shook his head and said, “Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, there’s no need to flatter us. I know what you’re thinking. Given Jiahao’s talent, even I don’t think that he is worthy of your Xiaoxiao.”

The face of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief paled in horror. He had no idea what Shengguang Xuanye was playing at, but he had a bad feeling about it. He quickly kneeled to the floor.

“Lord Xuanye...”

But before he could say anything, Shengguang Xuanye had already interjected, “Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, hurry up and get up.”

With a wave of his hand, he exerted a force that pulled the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief back onto his feet before continuing on.

“Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, you know well that I initially intended to betroth Xiaoxiao to our Shengguang Yu. The two of them are truly worthy of one another. Yet, who could have thought that Chu Feng would do something as dastardly as that upon hearing that news? He actually forced himself on Princess Xiaoxiao!

“Unable to stand the humiliation, Princess Xiaoxiao ruined her own face. She felt that she’s no longer worthy of Shengguang Yu now that her body has been sullied, so she adamantly refused to marry him. Even though Shengguang Yu doesn’t mind it, she continues to reject the marriage, even saying that she would rather end her own life. It was out of no choice that I betrothed Princess Xiaoxiao to Jiahao instead.

“No matter what, our Holy Light Clan do have a responsibility to play behind Princess Xiaoxiao’s humiliation. We can’t just turn a blind eye to it.”

Shengguang Xuanye’s words caught everyone present by surprise, including the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

They hadn’t expected to hear such words from him.

According to the rumors, Long Xiaoxiao had rejected the marriage proposal from the Holy Light Clan due to her feelings for Chu Feng, and that was what led to her disfigurement.

Yet, why was Shengguang Xuanye pinning all blame on Chu Feng?

“Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, I have let your Dragon Clan down through this marriage. However, this is the only way that Princess Xiaoxiao is willing to oblige with this wedding ceremony. I hope that you won’t blame us for this,” Shengguang Xuanye said.

“Of course not, Lord Xuanye. I should be thanking you for having such a high opinion of our Xiaoxiao instead.”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief knew what Shengguang Xuanye was up to, but he dared not to expose the latter’s despicable lies. He could only go along with the latter’s play.

Yet, there were some who were unsure of the truth who actually believed what Shengguang Xuanye was saying after hearing the response of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. Indignant looks appeared on their faces as they began to berate Chu Feng.

“That’s impossible. Young friend Chu Feng couldn’t possibly do something like that to Princess Xiaoxiao, right?”

Even the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster began discussing this matter with the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief through voice transmission.

All they had heard were rumors thus far, so they didn’t know the truth of the matter.

“Don’t you know young friend Chu Feng well?” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

Those words affirmed the thoughts of the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster.

“Of course! There’s no way young friend Chu Feng would do something like that. Bloody hell, that Shengguang Xuanye sure is underhanded. He’s using this occasion to throw mud on young friend Chu Feng’s reputation!

“This is bad. It looks like quite a few have started believing Shengguang Xuanye’s story.”

With just a quick glance around, the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster was able to see many shocked and infuriated faces around. It looked like many of them were buying into Shengugang Xuanye’s story.

“Rest assured, Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. Princess Xiaoxiao will be one of us from this day onward, so I’ll make sure to treat her face. As for Chu Feng, not only is he Princess Xiaoxiao’s enemy, he shall also be the enemy of our Holy Light Clan too!” Shengguang Xuanye declared.

“Thank you, Lord Xuanye!”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was put at a spot, but he had no choice but to thank the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief given the current situation.

“You need not thank me. Even if not for Xiaoxiao’s humiliation, I wouldn’t let Chu Feng off either. You must be unaware that the crimes committed by Chu Feng aren’t just limited to Princess Xiaoxiao.

“Men, bring them up!” Shengguang Xuanye said with a grand wave of his sleeves.

A huge war chariot floated out from the main city, and several thousand people slowly made their way out from within. Their clothes showed that they were from different powers, but they were all beautiful young women.

All of them began wailing miserably as they kneeled down before Shengguang Xuanye.

“Lord Xuanye, please redress our grievances!”

Those women cried as if someone had done them a huge injustice, leaving the crowd bewildered.

“Everyone, Princess Xiaoxiao isn’t the only victim of Chu Feng’s tyranny. These are people whom Chu Feng has taken advantage of, and I believe that this is only a small portion of them. There’s bound to be more women who have fallen prey to Chu Feng out there in the galaxy,” Shengguang Xuanye said.

Those words stirred a huge commotion. Shengguang Xuanye was saying that Chu Feng had raped all of these women.

“Truly shameless! He’s trying to paint young friend Chu Feng as a sex fiend!” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster said.

“Something is amiss,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief remarked.

“What’s amiss?” Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster asked.

“Young friend Chu Feng is on close terms with the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. Shengguang Xuanye knows about it given how she saved Chu Feng the other day. It’s weird how far he’s going to provoke Chu Feng now.

“Shengguang Xuanye is definitely not an irrational person. Something must have happened that gave him the confidence to do this,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief deduced. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“There’s no point thinking that far now. Look at those women there; they are all from distinguished backgrounds. That lends credence to Shengguang Xuanye’s claim. Look, more and more people are getting convinced by him. He must have prepared this hand for quite some time now,” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster said.

“You’re saying that they are in cahoots with Shengguang Xuanye?” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Cahoots? That would leave behind evidence. Shengguang Xuanye wouldn’t put himself in a vulnerable position. I reckon that he sent someone disguised as young friend Chu Feng to commit those atrocities,” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster replied.

“That’s indeed possible.”

The Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief took a closer look at those women and saw that their anguish was real. It didn’t seem like they were putting on an act here.

Considering how vicious Shengguang Xuanye was, it was not beneath him to do something like that.

“He really is a despicable man. I still don’t understand. What gives him the confidence to do something like this?” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief murmured in confusion.

“Everyone, please rest easy. No matter how talented Chu Feng might be, our Holy Light Clan won’t condone such acts. We’ll use everything at our disposal to eradicate him so as to return you justice!” Shengguang Xuanye declared.

“Kill Chu Feng! Kill Chu Feng!”

The crowd roared in agreement, displaying their support for Shengguang Xuanye. There were quite a number of people who had been duped by his speech.

“We’ll deal with Chu Feng in due time, but let’s not forget the reason why we’re here. Today is the day of Princess Xiaoxiao and Jiahao’s wedding. Jiahao, go and fetch your bride,” Shengguang Xuanye said.

Shengguang Jiahao laughed merrily as he quickly ran toward the carriage.

He was still looking normal a moment ago, but he seemed to have reverted back to his doltish self. He anxiously rushed to the carriage and opened the doors.

“Aiya!”

The moment the doors to the carriage were opened, Shengguang Jiahao suddenly recoiled in horror.

Perplexed, the crowd glanced into the carriage, only to be shocked by what they had seen too.

Shengguang Xuanye’s face turned completely livid.
