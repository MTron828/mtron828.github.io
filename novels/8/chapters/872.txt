MGA: Chapter 873 - Good Brothers

When they were closely examining Chu Feng, Chu Feng too discovered Zhang Tianyi’s and Jiang Wushang’s cultivation had risen to the ninth level of the Heaven realm.

Actually, before refining the Sacred Entity, Chu Feng’s actual cultivation was also the ninth level of the Heaven realm. The reason the world thought he was a rank three Martial Lord was all because Chu Feng used the power of the three lightnings to raise his cultivation to rank three Martial Lord. Thus, the actual cultivation level he revealed to the world was merely an illusion.

Jiang Wushang and Zhang Tianyi also knew this, so that was why they felt as long as they entered the ninth level of the Heaven realm, they would have caught up to Chu Feng.

However, after Chu Feng refined the Sacred Entity, there was a change in essence regarding his cultivation. The three lightnings were no longer external power but one with Chu Feng. Right now, his true cultivation was no longer the ninth level of the Heaven realm, but rank five Martial Lord.

“Heavens! You... you’re too strong, aren’t you? You’ve truly become a rank five Martial Lord, and you haven’t even used the power from the lightning! You... You... You...

“What are we supposed to do now?!”

Suddenly, Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang shouted at the same time. They had looked at Chu Feng’s eyes for a very long time, and discovered there was no lightning. So, they confirmed that not only was his cultivation raised, his cultivation was without the aid of the lightning.

However, even though they were grieving loudly, as though they received a huge blow to their hearts, because Chu Feng once again widened the gap in their cultivations, he could tell that they were actually very happy. They felt happy because Chu Feng was able to improve so greatly.

These were true brothers.

But since Chu Feng had some strength now, he wasn’t willing to see his brothers and lovers travel too slowly on the journey of cultivation.

Although it was very difficult for Chu Feng to help the others, Jiang Wushang now had an Imperial Bloodline! Moreover, there was a single similarity between him and Chu Feng—the rise in cultivation relied on cultivation resources. And... Chu Feng had received quite a few good quality cultivation resources from Lord Yan of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.

Even though to Chu Feng, resources such as Heaven medicines and Martial medicines weren’t of much use to him anymore, to Jiang Wushang, they would likely help greatly.

As such, Chu Feng only left a small portion of the cultivation resources to use as currency, and gave the rest to Jiang Wushang.

“Big Brother Chu Feng, you’ve already given me enough help. I can’t accept these cultivation resources. Just keep them for yourself.” But, who would have expected Jiang Wushang to refuse Chu Feng’s good intentions.

“You’re being so polite even to me? If you don’t take it, then don’t call me ‘Big Brother’ anymore!” Chu Feng forcibly stuffed the cultivation resources to Jiang Wushang.

“Ahh...”

After a long hesitation, Jiang Wushang still took and put away the cultivation resources. However, as he did so, he helplessly heaved a long sigh.

“Brother Wushang, is there something troubling you?” Chu Feng asked.

“Big Brother Chu Feng, after acquiring the Imperial Bloodline, I do have greater requirements for cultivation resources, but my comprehension strength has become stronger as well. Yet, even so, I am still no match for you,” Jiang Wushang said depressingly.

“Brother Wushang, what do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“Big Brother Chu Feng, you said as long as you have enough cultivation resources, you can directly make breakthroughs. For you, the accumulation of power within your dantian is the difficult part, and the comprehension part when making a breakthrough is a piece of cake.

“So, I originally thought after receiving the Imperial Bloodline, I too could be like you. But I’ve discovered I was wrong.

“Even though the Imperial Bloodline has strengthened my fighting power, causing change throughout my body, even making my comprehension strength more powerful, but... if I want to make a breakthrough, I still find it quite difficult.

“Especially right now, when I’m facing the huge gap to become a Martial Lord. I have a premonition that even if I accumulate enough power, and understand the method of breakthrough, it will still be very difficult to succeed on my first try,” Jiang Wushang said.

“You’re saying there are high requirements to make a single breakthrough in regards to comprehension strength?” Chu Feng asked.

“Mm.” Jiang Wushang nodded, then as he looked at Chu Feng, his eyes were full of admiration. He said, “Big Brother Chu Feng, you are truly a genius. A true genius.”

“Brother Wushang, what’s with you now? Why did you suddenly say that?” Chu Feng was confused.

“It’s because I’ve discovered you acquired your cultivation attainments not only because you grasp special power, but also because your innate aptitude is extremely strong.

“The reason you have such powerful comprehension strength is perhaps related to your special power, but it is more so related to yourself. You’ve always had great talent in cultivation, so what’s why you have all these accomplishments.

“As for me, I don’t have your powerful comprehension strength, nor talent as good as yours. So, even though I now have the Imperial Bloodline and sufficient resources, I’m unable to quickly make breakthroughs like you,” Jiang Wushang said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After hearing Jiang Wushang’s words, Chu Feng really didn’t know how to console him. He already knew about that—the Divine Lightning had indeed strengthened his body and brought him powerful strength. On the other hand, his outstanding comprehension power seemed more innate.

Before, when Chu Feng didn’t know much about cultivation, he felt his exceptionality in everything was all brought by the Divine Lightning. But, along with his greater knowledge and experience, he learnt that some aptitude in people was decided when born.

“However, Chu Feng, you don’t need to worry about me. Even if I’m inferior to you, I’m at least superior to others. I will work hard. I will work hard to catch up to you, Big Brother Chu Feng.

“Also, I’ve discovered that the Imperial Bloodline is very powerful. As long as I can become a Martial Lord, my fighting strength will rise again. Perhaps, at that time, it won’t be any weaker than yours!

“Moreover, that doesn’t only apply to me. It also applies to Big Brother Tianyi. Although he doesn’t have an Imperial Bloodline, the Forbidden Mysterious Technique he cultivates is very special. Before you returned, we had sparred and it ended up a tie!

“He also told me he has a faint feeling when he becomes a Martial Lord, he will be able to grasp an entirely new power. So, even if I become a Martial Lord and become stronger, he won’t be afraid of me,” Jiang Wushang said with a smile, as if afraid Chu Feng would worry.

In reality, Chu Feng was indeed much at ease after hearing his words.

Just like that, after Chu Feng had a small gathering with Zi Ling, Su Rou, Su Mei, Jiang Wushang, and Zhang Tianyi at Zi Ling’s residence, Chu Feng headed towards Chun Wu’s residence.

He was preparing to cultivate the Taboo martial skill, the “Earthen Taboo—Firmament Slash”. However, that required a special land of cultivation.
