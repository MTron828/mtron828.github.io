Chapter 2093 - Searching For Physical Bodies

“So a Half Martial Ancestor soul is required? That is great to know. Merely, a soul of that level is extremely difficult to refine,” Chu Feng felt somewhat disappointed. Originally, he had been planning to quickly obtain materials to refine a soul for the weapon. However, it would seem that he could only drop the subject now.

“Actually, it’s a very simple task. After you enter the Outer World, there will definitely be a lot of Half Martial Ancestor-level experts. At that time, you can just use the souls of other cultivators,” The Azure Dragon said.

“Isn’t something like that too cruel?” The Vermilion Bird asked.

“What’s cruel about it? If you are to find evildoers and refine their souls, there would not be anything cruel about that. To them, this might serve as a kind of redemption,” The White Tiger refuted.

“In that case, wouldn’t it do if we were to use the Dark Hall Hall Master’s soul?” The Azure Dragon asked.

“That’s feasible. The Dark Hall’s Hall Master has done all sorts of evil. He is someone that should be killed.”

“Furthermore, he is a Half Martial Ancestor in the Holy Land of Martialism. As long as you are able to refine that man’s soul, you would be able to assimilate it into the Imperial Armament,” At that moment, both the White Tiger and the Vermilion Bird expressed their approval.

“No, I can’t do that,” However, Chu Feng shook his head at that exceptionally good proposal from the Four Great Divine Beasts.

“Why’s that?” The Four Great Divine Beasts asked in a confused manner.

“The Dark Hall’s Hall Master must be killed,” A ruthless expression flashed through Chu Feng’s eyes.

At that moment, the Four Great Divine Beasts all understood Chu Feng’s intentions. Thus, they said no more.

As for Chu Feng, he put that Imperial Armament away and then moved to leave this place.

However, before leaving, Chu Feng sealed this region with his own world spirit techniques.

He was afraid that someone might accidentally enter this place. As he had taken away all of the treasures here, this place was already empty.

If one were to enter this place, one would only be met with danger upon danger. Rather than having the people that enter this place in the future encounter those dangers, he felt that it was better to seal this place off to solve any future troubles.

Through the directions given by the Four Great Divine Beasts, Chu Feng came to find out what had happened back then.

It was as Chu Feng had guessed. Back then, the battle between Qing Xuantian and the Magma Emperor could be said to have been world-shocking. However, with the assistance of the Four Great Divine Beasts, Qing Xuantian had managed to suppress the Magma Emperor completely.

Just when Qing Xuantian was about to obtain absolute dominance in the battle, a spatial crack leading to the Eastern Sea Region had appeared at a place near where the two were fighting.

The Magma Emperor escaped into the spatial crack. As for Qing Xuantian, he followed after the Magma Emperor. Just like that, the two of them had shifted the battlefield from the Holy Land of Martialism to the Eastern Sea Region.

It was also in the Eastern Sea Region that the Four Great Divine Beasts had used their own bodies to seal off the Magma Emperor.

As for what had happened afterwards, Chu Feng already knew about all It.

............

At Present, Chu Feng had arrived at the Eastern Sea Region, secretly flying above the sea waves.

Although Chu Feng’s speed was extremely fast, no one was able to notice his existence. After all, with Chu Feng’s current level of cultivation, he was already an existence akin to god in the Eastern Sea Region.

After making inquiries about the matters regarding Qing Xuantian, Chu Feng asked, “Seniors, I have another question in mind. I don’t know if seniors might be able to tell me the answer to this question?”

“What is it? Ask away,” The Four Great Divine Beasts said in unison. After chatting with Chu Feng, they began to like Chu Feng more and more, and were extremely fond of chatting with him. They would not hold anything back in their chats.

“This junior has obtained the martial skills senior Qing Xuantian left behind in the Gate of Martial Skills. Among them is an extremely powerful martial skill by the name of Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation.”

“The Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation’s power already surpasses those of Heaven Taboo Martial Skills. I wonder, does that Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation belong among Heaven Taboo Martial Skills, or could it be a legendary Divine Taboo Martial Skill?” Chu Feng asked.

“Haha, it turns out that that’s actually what you are wondering about. Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, how could Divine Taboo Martial Skills be that easily obtained? You’re thinking too much,” The White Tiger burst into loud laughter.

“In that case, it’s only a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill then? But, for a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill to be this powerful...” Chu Feng gasped in admiration.

To him, the matter concerning the Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation was no longer a question of quality anymore. Instead, it had completely surpassed all other Heaven Taboo Martial Skills.

It was just like that Imperial Armament that he had fused. It had already surpassed all other Imperial Armaments, and was no longer on the same level as them.

“No, the Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation is neither a Divine Taboo Martial Skill nor a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill,” The Azure Dragon said.

“Then, what is it?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng became even more curious.

“It is an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill. That Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation is also one of the most precious treasures that Qing Xuantian obtained from that Ancient Era’s remnant.”

“Back then, there was a complete record of that Taboo Martial Skill. According to the records, it is a Taboo Martial Skill, an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill, that surpasses Heaven Taboo Martial Skills,” The Azure Dragon explained.

“In that case, above Heaven Taboo Martial Skills is not actually Divine Taboo Martial Skills, but instead the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill?” Chu Feng asked in astonishment.

He had firmly believed in what Eggy said the entire time. Yet now, the Azure Dragon and the others had shattered the words Eggy had told him before.

“We, and even Qing Xuantian, are also uncertain about the specifics. However, we have heard about Divine Taboo Martial Skills. The Divine Taboo Martial Skills that we heard about are legends. We do not even know whether or not they actually exist in this world.”

“Thus, we are certain about one thing: above Heaven Taboo Martial Skills should be the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill. As for whether or not Divine Taboo Martial Skills actually exist or not, you will likely only find out about them after entering the Outer World,” The Azure Dragon said.

“This junior understands,” Chu Feng truly understood. The reason for that was because Eggy also mentioned that Divine Taboo Martial Skills were legends.

Thus, though incomparable to Divine Taboo Martial Skills, it was reasonable to say that Emperor Taboo Martial Skills were existences above Heaven Taboo Martial Skills. After all, Chu Feng had completely grasped that Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation.

Suddenly, the Azure Dragon said, “Chu Feng, we’ve arrived. It’s right ahead.”

Hearing what the Azure Dragon said, Chu Feng immediately stopped in midair and turned his gaze downward.

Upon first glance, he noticed that the region of water down below him did not appear to be any different from the rest of the water in the sea. Other than the fact that the surrounding ten thousand mile radius was completely uninhabited, there was nothing strange about it.

Thus, Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eyes to inspect the sea.

Sure enough, with his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng discovered the abnormality. However, he only discovered it after observing the sea carefully. If he had not observed it carefully, even Chu Feng would not have been able to tell.

“Senior Qing Xuantian’s world spirit techniques are truly exceptional.”

Chu Feng exclaimed in admiration. The reason why this place was so hard to discover was because there was a layer of concealment formations around it. Evidently, the only person who could set up that level of concealment formation would be Qing Xuantian.

“Splash~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s body shifted, and the water on the surface of the sea soared into the sky. Like a dragon, he entered the water.

Chu Feng’s speed was so fast that he instantly arrived at the seafloor, a place where no light could penetrate.

Even though this place was pitch-black, and not a single life form was present, Chu Feng was able to clearly see everything around him with his Heaven’s Eyes.

Chu Feng began to set up a spirit formation that could undo the concealment formation. After some time and effort, Chu Feng soon succeeded.

“This!!!”

When the concealment formation was undone, Chu Feng was astonished. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
