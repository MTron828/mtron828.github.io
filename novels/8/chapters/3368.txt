Chapter 3368 - Screams

With Bai Liluo traveling at her full speed, she and Chu Feng quickly arrived outside the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

Upon arriving, they discovered that the enormous Wuma Heavenly Clan was actually sealed off by a boundless spirit formation.

Even though the territory of the Wuma Heavenly Clan was enormous, the spirit formation actually managed to completely seal it off from both the sky and the ground. The vastness of this spirit formation was simply shocking.

Furthermore, the spirit formation was not hidden. Thus, everyone could clearly see it.

Furthermore, there were Wuma Heavenly Clansmen present all around the outside of the spirit formation.

However, they were not Wuma Heavenly Clansmen from the main clan. Instead, they were all from the branch clan.

As if they were the rulers of the Scarlet Province Upper Realm, those outsiders stood high in the sky and looked down on everything arrogantly.

Such a sight had already caught the attention of the people nearby.

At that moment, the nearby powers had all gathered around the spirit formation. Furthermore, those that had heard of what was happening were all gathering toward that location.

Although they did not know exactly what had happened between the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s main clan and branch clan, the powers of the Scarlet Province Upper Realm all had worried expressions on their faces upon seeing such a sight. Faintly, they had a feeling that something major was about to occur.

“Say, little brother, that spirit formation is a bit difficult to deal with. Unless I am to strongly attack it, it’ll be difficult to get in,” Bai Liluo said.

“Big sister Liluo, please wait a moment. Let me have a look at the situation inside first.”

Chu Feng and Bai Liluo were standing in the sky. Although they were kept out by the sealing formation, Chu Feng was able to see through the spirit formation and the situation inside using his Heaven’s Eyes.

The branch clan and the main clan seemed to be in negotiations. The scene that he had feared had yet to occur. Chu Feng knew that the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief must be thinking of a way to settle the matter.

If Chu Feng were to act rashly at a time like this, he might affect the relationship between the main clan and the branch clan.

Thus, Chu Feng decided to observe first. With his Heaven’s Eyes, even if he was unable to hear the conversation inside, he was able to tell what they were talking about through observations.

Chu Feng wanted to make his decision after determining the situation.

If the Wuma Heavenly Clan failed to settle the crisis, Chu Feng would naturally offer his help.

However, if they could settle the crisis on their own, Chu Feng would not have to involve himself and would not even show himself.

However, the more Chu Feng observed, the more he started to frown. Although the main clan and the branch clan had yet to start fighting, Chu Feng was able to tell that the situation was not very optimistic at all.

“Big sister Liluo, let us prepare to force our way in at any time,” Chu Feng said.

“No problem,” Bai Liluo smiled sweetly and made a mischievous gesture.

Compared to Chu Feng’s seriousness, she was not worried in the slightest.

Whilst the people from the branch clan were able to instill fear into everyone present, Bai Liluo felt that she could easily take care of the bunch of them at any time.

......

Everyone in the Wuma Heavenly Clan, all of the rulers of the Scarlet Province Upper Realm, were currently being driven into an open space like a bunch of prisoners.

Densely packed and gathered in one place, they were truly a sea of people. Regardless of gender or age, they were all gathered in one spot.

At that moment, those proudest people of the Scarlet Province Upper Realm had faces that were filled with worries.

Not only were the children crying, but some of the married women were also crying. Unease and fear filled every corner of the vast sea of people, and filled the bodies of everyone present.

As for the people from the branch clan, they were standing in the sky like gods.

As they looked at the people from the main clan below, there was no trace of pity in their eyes. Instead, there were mocking smiles on their faces.

In their eyes, the people from the main clan had long stopped being their relatives. Instead, they were their enemies, their slaves.

“Lord Clan Chief!”

“No, you must not, you must not!”

At that moment, some elders from the main clan were trying their hardest to keep their Lord Clan Chief from doing something.

However, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief pushed them aside. He said, “I alone shall shoulder the decision today. I know that I will become the disgrace of our Wuma Heavenly Clan. I have failed my ancestors, failed you all. But, for the sake of our clan’s continued survival, I must do this.”

“Lord Clan Chief, please don’t say it like that. It is us who are incompetent. It is us who have failed you,” The elders from the main clan, the people who were originally standing high and above, were all weeping bitter tears.

They all knew what sort of decision their Lord Clan Chief had made.

His decision was a humiliation to the people of their clan. However, they had no choice but to accept it.

Faced with the reaction of the people from the main clan, the people from the branch clan were not only not moved in the slightest, but the sneering smiles on their faces even grew more intense. They reacted as if they were seeing a joke, one that brought great satisfaction to them.

“Wuma Yantian, I accept your condition.”

Suddenly, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked towards a figure in midair.

It was an old man. He was not standing in the sky. Instead, he was sitting on a war chariot and escorted by the branch clan’s peak experts. Like an emperor, he looked down on everything.

That old man was the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s branch clan’s clan chief, Wuma Yantian. He was also a rank eight Exalted-level martial cultivator.

Wuma Yantian reacted as if he did not hear what the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had said. Lazily, he looked at the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and did not respond.

Seeing that, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke again.

“Today, everyone from our Wuma Heavenly Clan will change their surname. You all can rest assured, that there will only be a single Wuma Heavenly Clan in this Ancestral Martial Starfield from now on.”

After he finished saying those words, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s body started to shiver.

The weeping sounds of the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen also intensified.

To change one’s surname was an act of extraordinary shame and humiliation!!!

However, after the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief finished saying those words, Wuma Yantian still had no reaction. It was not only Wuma Yantian; the others from the branch clan also did not react in the slightest.

It was as if they had already anticipated such a decision from the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and were not at all surprised.

“Wuma Yantian, I hope that you can abide by your promise,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief added.

“Hahaha...” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Suddenly, Wuma Yantian started laughing. His laughter was filled with mockery.

This caused the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen to feel even more uneasy.

“Wuma Yantian, why are you laughing?” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

Wuma Yantian slowly sat straight. With his eyes narrowed, he looked to the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, “You are truly foolish. Did you really think that I came here today only for you all to change your surname?”

“Actually, regardless of whether or not you all are willing to change your surname, the result today will still be the same.”

“What do you mean by that?” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief revealed a startled expression. A deep sense of unease appeared in his eyes. Likely, what he worried about the most would occur.

“You don’t understand? Very well, I’ll say it more forthrightly.”

“Today, I have come so that all you trash will forever disappear from this world,” Wuma Yantian revealed a sinister look.

“You! You unfaithful bastard! We are of the same clan, how could you be so devoid of humanity?!”

Hearing those words, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief became enraged. Even though he already had a feeling that this might happen, he was still deeply enraged when such a thing really happened.

No matter what, they were from the same clan.

As for the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen, they’d entered a state of panic.

Some of them were cursing out the branch clan, whilst some kneeling and begging for forgiveness. In that instant, they’d become completely panicked.

However, regardless of whether it might be the curses or the begging of the main clansmen, Wuma Yantian did not show any remorse or self-blame on his face. Instead, the sinister look on his face grew even stronger.

“Begin.”

Suddenly, killing intent emerged in his eyes as he waved his sleeve.

At that very instant, everyone from the branch clan unsheathed their weapons.

Enormous oppressive might and killing intent that filled the sky emerged in an instant, engulfing everyone from the main clan.

At that moment, all of the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen entered a state of despair.

Wuma Yantian was a rank eight Exalted. If he wanted to kill them, none of them would be able to escape death.

They all knew that they would not be able to escape a calamity.

They, the Wuma Heavenly Clan, would be extinguished.

“Bang~~~”

However, right at that moment, a loud sound was suddenly heard.

After that sound was heard, both the people from the main clan and the branch clan revealed a change in expression.

The reason for that was because that loud sound came from outside the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

Furthermore, there seemed to be screams accompanying the loud sound.

At that moment, the expressions of the branch clansmen changed. All of the main clansmen were gathered there.

Thus, wouldn’t that mean that the screams were from the people of their branch clan?
