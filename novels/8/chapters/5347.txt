Chapter 5347: The Target Happens to be Chu Feng

Chapter 5347: The Target Happens to be Chu Feng

The white-haired elder looked at Chu Feng in utter shock. He was only wary of Chu Feng because the latter had won the title of the Totem Galaxy’s strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator, but he didn’t think that the latter would be so skilled in world spiritist techniques too.

It was rarely worthwhile to simultaneously train as a world spiritist and martial cultivator, which was why most top prodigies would choose one to focus on depending on their aptitude. 

This could be seen in how the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had plenty of outstanding world spiritists, but most of them had weak cultivation. Similarly, those from the other powers tended to be stronger in cultivation, but they were weak in terms of spirit power. 

There were very few all-rounders like Chu Feng in the vast world of cultivation.

Talents of his caliber were bound to have powerful backing. No matter how talented he was, there was no way he could have reached his current level in just a few decades without support from others. 

“Hand over the thing,” Chu Feng said.

Young master Bai Yue’s complexion looked awful. He glared at Chu Feng with indignant eyes, refusing to hand over the item even though he had already lost the bet. Chu Feng stared back at him with sharp eyes. 

In this exchange of gaze, young master Bai Yue appeared to have the upper hand at the very start, but he soon started to panic under Chu Feng's chilling and unwavering gaze. Inexplicable fear started to well in his heart, forcing him to avert his gaze. 

“Don’t worry, I’m not a sore loser.” Young master Bai Yue tossed the compass to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng took the compass, but instead of handing it over to the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief right away, he said, “Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief, I’ll return this item to you after I awaken the treasure on the Unageing Peak.”

This served as an additional layer of insurance in case the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief reneged on his promise. He had seen the protection formation and knew that he wouldn’t be able to enter the Unageing Peak unless the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief granted him access. 

The Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief panicked upon hearing those words.

“Young master Chu Feng, that treasure…”

Chu Feng knew that the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief was worried that he wouldn’t return the treasure if he failed to awaken the treasure, so he said, “I know that it’ll be hard to awaken the treasure. I only have myself to blame if I fail in my endeavor. I promise to return your family heirloom as long as you open the protection formation for me, regardless of whether I succeed or fail.”

The Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief breathed a sigh of relief.

After having made an agreement, the Zhou Clan and Chu Feng returned to the Unageing Peak. The crowd learned that Chu Feng was planning to awaken the treasure and decided to tag along too. 

While they knew that it was nigh impossible for the treasure to be awakened, they wanted to join in the commotion. 

Shortly after Chu Feng and the others left, young master Bai Yue returned to the city and flew into a rage. “Screw it!” 

His face turned frighteningly livid, and his eyes were filled with indignation. 

None of those around him dared to utter a word. They were afraid that the slightest noise they made could draw young master Bai Yue’s wrath upon them. 

However, what young master Bai Yue was angry about was not the fact that Chu Feng had defeated him, but that he had tried to intimidate Chu Feng earlier during their exchange of gazes but ended up getting intimidated himself. That made him feel incompetent.

“What made you so angry?” A middle-aged man walked into the room.

“Paying respects to Lord Sectmaster!”

Everyone quickly bowed down to the middle-aged man.

“Father, you’re back.” Young master Bai Yue walked forward to welcome him.

“I’ve been back for a while now. I saw what happened outside. Chu Feng is indeed a highly talented individual. It’s not an embarrassment to lose to someone like him, so there’s no need for you to feel down about it,” the middle-aged man consoled. 

“My apologies, father. I have embarrassed you,” young master Bai Yue said with a lowered head.

“Why would I be embarrassed about my outstanding son?” the middle-aged man replied. 

“It’s a little displeasing how I publicly lost to Chu Feng and still had to let him off safely,” young master Bai Yue remarked with a sigh.

“If that is what’s bothering you, there’s no need to be frustrated. You’ll be able to get back at him very soon,” the middle-aged man said.

“Father, what do you mean by that?” Young master Bai Yue lifted his head and looked at the middle-aged man. 

“I just received news that Chu Feng doesn’t have any backing whatsoever. He just happens to be more talented than most others. In other words, there’s no need to fear him. Speaking of which, it really is a coincidence. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect has just issued me an order to eliminate Chu Feng,” the middle-aged man said.

“Eliminate Chu Feng? Does that mean that we’ll be able to make a comeback once more as long as we eliminate Chu Feng?” young master Bai Yue asked.

“As long as we eliminate Chu Feng and acquire the treasure on the Unageing Peak, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect will back us and allow our sect to see the light of day. We won’t have to bury our names any longer. You’ll also no longer have to suffer such grievances,” the middle-aged man said.

“That’s wonderful!” Young master Bai Yue was overjoyed. He already had enough of having to live his life humbly.

It was then that the white-haired elder suddenly spoke up, “Lord Sectmaster, why did the Pill Dao Immortal Sect suddenly order us to eliminate Chu Feng? Does Chu Feng have any past conflict with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?”

“That’s beyond my knowledge, but that’s not something we have to be concerned about. As long as we can accomplish the two tasks the Pill Dao Immortal Sect has set for us, we’ll be able to make a comeback. Old Man Zhou is currently severely ill, which means that the only thing that stands between us and the treasure is the protection formation. I was still thinking about how I should go about dealing with that protection formation, but it looks like Chu Feng has already helped us deal with that,” the middle-aged man said in excitement. 

“Father, let’s make a move right now. I can’t wait to see Chu Feng’s frightened look,” young master Bai Yue said.

“Relay my orders. We’ll be setting out soon!” the middle-aged man said.

… 

Chu Feng was unaware of what young master Bai Yue and the others were up to. His mind was solely focused on returning to the Unageing Peak and awakening the treasure. 

It didn’t take him long to return to the Unageing Peak. 

The Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief unlocked the protection formation, allowing everyone to scale the Unageing Peak. At the top of the Unageing Peak, Chu Feng finally got to see the treasure in person. 

It was a crystal harnessing potent recovery energy that could heal world spirits and cultivators alike, though its healing properties were much better when used on world spirits instead. Chu Feng could tell that the crystal would definitely be of help to Eggy.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief, how do I awaken the treasure?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young master Chu Feng, I’m afraid that I don’t have the answer to your question. All I know is that only someone qualified will be able to awaken the treasure, but no one, including me, has been able to induce a response from it thus far. According to my father, the treasure will emit a mysterious glow once it is awakened,” the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief explained.

“I see,” Chu Feng replied.

He started making his way toward the crystal.

Weng!

Before Chu Feng could even get close, the crystal had already begun glowing. This shocked everyone, especially those from the Zhou Clan. 

Countless people have tried to approach the treasure over the years, but it has never reacted to anyone. Yet, here it was, glowing in response to Chu Feng’s approach. Its luminosity further intensified with each step closer he took, making clear the reason behind the phenomenon.

“Is this… a true prodigy?”

Zhou Zhi looked at Chu Feng in admiration. He could feel the huge gap between him and Chu Feng even though he was deemed to be a prodigy too, and it was this feeling of being utterly overwhelmed that filled him with respect for the latter. 

“Chu Feng, how did you do it?” Eggy asked in astonishment.

“I don’t know either. It just happened. I didn’t do anything at all, “Chu Feng replied.

“Hahaha! It truly is a treasure. It must be reacting in such a manner after sensing how extraordinary you are,” Eggy exclaimed.

“Elder, does this mean that the treasure is mine now?” Chu Feng asked the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief.

The Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief snapped out of his shock and replied, “Yes, yes! The treasure now belongs to young master Chu Feng!”

Chu Feng was delighted to have heard the confirmation.

Shoosh!

All of a sudden, the crystal shot into the sky and flew into a person’s grasp. Unbeknownst to the crowd, a group of people had appeared in the sky at some point in time. Following that, a powerful surge of spirit power enveloped the Unageing Peak.

“It’s them?”

The crowd widened their eyes in shock.

The person standing at the forefront of the group was young master Bai Yue’s father, and the crystal was currently held in his hand. Chu Feng didn’t recognize young master Bai Yue’s father, but he could sense that the latter was a Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, comparable to a pinnacle Half-God level cultivator.

The crowd paled in horror. Not even the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief dared to utter a word in this situation. They could already tell that the other party had come with hostile intentions.
