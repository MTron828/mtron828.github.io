Chapter 3221 - Help One More Time

“Young master Chu Feng, it’s all our fault for trusting the Linghu Heavenly Clan. We had thought that they would really keep their promise and let bygones be bygones. Never did we expect that they’d break their promise. What are we to do now?”

The crowd began to look at Chu Feng with gazes pleading for help.

However, Chu Feng remained completely indifferent to their pleas. He said, “Everyone, there’s one thing that I need you all to understand.”

“Apart from my brothers and sister from the Chu Heavenly Clan, I, Chu Feng, don’t have any relationship with any of you.”

“In fact, earlier, when the Puyang Heavenly Clansmen decided to attack me, not a single one of you stood forth to stop them. In fact, none of you even bothered to utter a single word of dissuasion to them.”

“If the Puyang Heavenly Clansmen possessed strength above my own, then I, Chu Feng, would’ve already been ruthlessly taken care of by them. As for you all, not only would you all not show any pity for me, but it would already be pretty good if you all did not ridicule me, isn’t that so?” Chu Feng looked to the crowd and spoke with a sneer.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd silently lowered their heads. To a greater or lesser degree, an ashamed expression appeared on their faces. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After all, what Chu Feng said was very reasonable.

It was as Chu Feng had said, if he were truly defeated by Puyang Han, the great majority of them would have ridiculed him.

The reason why the crowd was so respectful and obedient toward Chu Feng was merely because they realized how powerful he was, and that they could rely on him.

“There are no relationships between us all to begin with. I, Chu Feng, have been extremely benevolent to agree to bring you all into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.”

“Thus, forgive me for speaking forthrightly. Right now, regardless of whether or not the Linghu Heavenly Clan plans to attack you or not, it’s none of my concern.”

“Furthermore, I also wish to remind you all this; the one that brought you all in here is me, Chu Feng. The one that the Linghu Heavenly Clan detests the most is also me, Chu Feng. Besides me, what they detest the most would be the people from my Chu Heavenly Clan. Actually, compared to us, you’re not in that much danger.”

“Thus, if you all do not follow me, it might instead be safer,” Chu Feng said.

“Young master Chu Feng, although we indeed did not possess any friendships in the past, we could be considered to have gone through a tribulation of life and death together. You cannot just...”

Hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd became nervous, and all started to speak to urge Chu Feng to reconsider. Many among them even began to bring up how pitiful their situation was in the hopes of changing Chu Feng’s mind and having him help them.

“What Chu Feng said is actually very correct. If the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s newcomers are truly planning to come take care of us, then Chu Feng would be their main target. Following him might be more dangerous,” right at that moment, Li Anzhi spoke.

Hearing what Li Anzhi said, the crowd became somewhat at a loss at to what to do.

When it was only Chu Feng who said those words, they felt that Chu Feng was merely saying that to get rid of them.

However, after hearing Li Anzhi say the same thing, they began to feel that what Chu Feng said was the truth.

After carefully analyzing it themselves, the crowd felt it to be quite reasonable.

At that moment, the crowd became trapped in a dilemma, and did not know what they should do.

“I will offer you all another word of advice. If you all wish to leave this place safely, it’s best to not touch the cultivation resources here. Should you encounter the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, you should say something good to them, and they will likely not make things too difficult for you all.”

“However, if you all wish to obtain cultivation resources, then prepare yourselves to confront the Linghu Heavenly Clan.”

“After all, the world of martial cultivators is like this. Not to mention the fact that we have already clashed with the Linghu Heavenly Clan, even if we didn’t have any conflicts with them, it would be inevitable for struggles to occur after entering a place filled with cultivation resources together,” Chu Feng said.

“What young master Chu Feng said is very correct. However... since we’ve already entered this place, if we are to return empty-handed, it will be truly too difficult to bear.”

“That’s right. After all, this place is the legendary Holy Spirit Formation of Light.”

“That vile Linghu Heavenly Clan is simply too tyrannical!”

“They are capable of concealing the sky with one hand. They simply do not plan to give us a path to survival.”

“If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have come to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

At that moment, the crowd was completely tangled, and sighing and voicing their complaints repeatedly.

They naturally did not wish to confront the Linghu Heavenly Clan. After all, they felt from the bottom of their hearts that they would not be able to win against the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

However, on the other hand, they did not wish to return empty-handed. At that moment, they were left in a dilemma.

“There’s no such thing as being able to enjoy the best of both worlds. You all want to obtain cultivation resources, yet still want to be safe. That’s not only something that’d be impossible here, but it would also be equally unobtainable elsewhere,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, more and more people began to sigh.

Apart from Chu Feng, Li Anzhi and a select few others, the great majority of the crowd were all feeling very downcast.

Seeing the reaction of the crowd, Chu Feng felt a bit moved.

“Everyone, although we’re mere strangers that came together by chance, we do have a common ground. All of us stood in opposition against the Linghu Heavenly Clan.”

“Don’t say that I, Chu Feng, am not planning to lend you all a helping hand. If you all really wish to come out of this unscathed, do as I suggested earlier, and do not touch any of the cultivation resources here. Should you encounter the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, apologize to them and admit your mistake.”

“However, if you don’t wish to have come here in vain, and wish to obtain some harvest in this Holy Spirit Formation of Light, you all can follow me, Chu Feng.”

“I, Chu Feng, am able to bring you all to a place with cultivation resources. Everyone can train there. However, I will not concern myself with what happens after the training.”

“Is there anyone that is willing to follow me?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am, I am willing.”

Once Chu Feng asked that question, someone immediately voiced their desire to follow him.

“I am also willing. Since I’ve already come here, I cannot return empty-handed.”

“That’s right. Your daddy, I, am also a brave and manly man. At the very most, it’ll be a battle should I return empty-handed.”

Surprisingly, the great majority of the people present all expressed their desire to follow Chu Feng.

This came as a slight surprise to Chu Feng. Originally, he had felt that the great majority of the people would elect to give up on the cultivation resources to save themselves.

He did not expect that, apart from the people from the Li Heavenly Clan, the others present were all willing to risk their lives for the sake of cultivation resources.

At that moment, Chu Feng turned his eyes to Li Anzhi.

After all, only the people from the Li Heavenly Clan had yet to express their position.
