MGA: Chapter 1877 - Purple Flames Blackmountain

“Ah?!!!”

Baili Xuankong and the others were immediately stunned upon hearing what Nangong Longjian said. This was especially true for the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain. They simply did not dare to believe what they had just heard, and suspected that they might have misheard it.

Nangong Longjian, this Holy Land of Martialism’s absolute expert, actually also wanted to be their Cyanwood Mountain’s guest elder?

“Could it be that you are not willing?” Nangong Longjian asked with a smile. He who generally never smiled actually started to joke around.

“Willing, we’re willing of course. Not to mention our Cyanwood Mountain, even the Three Palaces would be wild with joy should they be able to have you as their guest elder,” Baili Xuankong was truly extremely excited. He who was extremely experienced with the world was actually speaking with a trembling voice right now.

This was not because Baili Xuankong’s endurance was weak. Rather, it was because Nangong Longjian was simply too heavy of a matter. It was not only to him. Nangong Longjian possessed an extremely heavy weight about him to the entire Holy Land of Martialism. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Since I’ve become the Cyanwood Mountain’s guest elder, I am now part of the Cyanwood Mountain. If anyone dares to make the Cyanwood Mountain their enemy, they will have made me, Nangong Longjian, their enemy too. Regardless of who they might be, I, Nangong Longjian, will not let them get away with it,” Nangong Longjian said.

“Your words are already sufficient,” Hearing those words, Baili Xuankong was extremely overjoyed. Originally, he was feeling very sad to have personally killed Yin Chengkong. However, after all these people decided to make relations with their Cyanwood Mountain, the happiness that he felt had drowned his sadness.

“With all these grand experts having already become the Cyanwood Mountain’s guest elders, senior Baili, might you be willing to accept me should I also be willing to become a guest elder of the Cyanwood Mountain?” Hong Qiang asked with a beaming smile.

“Brother Hong Qiang, what are you saying? If you are willing to become our Cyanwood Mountain’s guest elder, it will definitely be our Cyanwood Mountain’s fortune,” Baili Xuankong said. Not only was Hong Qiang a Martial Emperor, the various things that he had done for Chu Feng had already caused Baili Xuankong to have a deep respect for him.

“If you really do not mind, I will return to the Cyanwood Mountain together with you. I hope that I will be able to use my power to help the Cyanwood Mountain,” Hong Qiang said.

“Very well. Welcome, welcome. Hahaha,” Baili Xuankong, Dugu Xingfeng and the others were all overjoyed.

Although a single Yin Chengkong had died, they had, in exchange, obtained many powerful experts as allies. In the future, not to mention the Nine Powers, even the Four Great Imperial Clans would not dare to look down on the Cyanwood Mountain. From this day on, the title of the strongest among the Nine Powers was destined to be the Cyanwood Mountain’s.

At that moment, Chu Feng felt sour in his heart upon hearing Hong Qiang saying that he would return to the Cyanwood Mountain alongside Baili Xuankong.

Hong Qiang had accompanied Chu Feng closely to protect him. Now that he was unable to protect Chu Feng anymore and needed Chu Feng’s protection instead, he most likely felt that it would be useless for him to accompany Chu Feng, and that he would become Chu Feng’s burden. Thus, he had decided to leave.

When Chu Feng was weak and small, he had insisted on protecting Chu Feng with his life. Now that Chu Feng had became powerful, he immediately decided to leave so that he would not drag Chu Feng down.

This... was what a true friend was. This... was the behavior of someone who was truly concerned for Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, guest elders, in that case, we shall take our leave,” Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang turned to leave.

The upper echelons of the Cyanwood Mountain like Dugu Xingfeng and the disciples like Jiang Furong also followed them.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly caught up to Jiang Furong and handed her a letter. He quietly said, “Senior sister Jiang, after you all have traveled far, please hand this letter to Ancestor.”

“Okay,” Jiang Furong nodded her head with a smile. She carefully put the letter Chu Feng handed her away.

Chu Feng stopped his footsteps and watched the figures of the people from the Cyanwood Mountain gradually disappearing into the distance. He was feeling very complicated.

When he had just arrived in the Holy Land of Martialism, not to mention the Cyanwood Mountain, even the Southern Cyanwood Forest was a huge monster to Chu Feng.

Yet, in a mere few years, Chu Feng had experienced a lot of things. The majority of them were related to the Cyanwood Mountain. The people that were extremely grand and powerful before were all surpassed by him. With the speed of his growth, Chu Feng had proved himself. Yet, he was feeling very depressed.

Chu Feng had to continue becoming stronger. This was a path that he had to take. However, as Chu Feng had decided to take this path, he was destined to gradually cast many of his friends, companions and benefactors far behind him. The path that he was taking was too difficult. For many of his companions, they were simply incapable of accompanying him.

Upon thinking of how the friends that he had shared trials and tribulations with were destined to be cast further and further behind by him in the future, Chu Feng felt very uncomfortable.

However, there was nothing that he could do about it. The path of a powerful expert was destined to be a lonely path.

After the people from the Cyanwood Mountain left, Yaojiao Guang led the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts and left too. At that moment, only Chu Feng, Nangong Longjian and the Compass Immortal remained.

“Senior Nangong Longjian, what is it that you want me to stay for?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.

It turned out that it was not Chu Feng that wanted to go and see Bai Ruochen. Rather, it was Nangong Longjian who had sent a voice transmission to him, telling him to stay. It was Nangong Longjian that had something he needed to tell Chu Feng.

At that moment, in addition to Chu Feng, the Compass Immortal also did not show any intention of leaving. Likely, Nangong Longjian had also sent him a voice transmission requesting that he stay.

“Two sirs, please follow me,” Nangong Longjian’s body shifted. Then, he began to travel at a very fast speed. At the same time, a gentle power covered Chu Feng and the Compass Immortal. That gentle power allowed the two of them to travel rapidly with Nangong Longjian. It turned out that Nangong Longjian was using his power to bring Chu Feng and the Compass Immortal with him.

............

The Cyanwood Mountain’s crowd.

Baili Xuankong was still leading everyone and traveling back to the Cyanwood Mountain when suddenly, Jiang Furong approached him. She half kneeled in mid-air and presented a sealed letter to Baili Xuankong with her hands. She said, “Ancestor, this is what Chu Feng wanted me to hand to you.”

“Oh?” Hearing the name ‘Chu Feng’, everyone’s gazes turned to the letter. They all wanted to know exactly what Chu Feng wanted to tell Baili Xuankong in the letter. However, they did not speak their mind.

Baili Xuankong was also very curious. Thus, he accepted the letter from Jiang Furong.

“Woosh~~~”

Right after the letter entered his hand, it started to shine with light and actually began to change. In a blink of an eye, the letter in Baili Xuankong’s hand disappeared, and was replaced with a Cosmos Sack.

Baili Xuankong inspected the Cosmos Sack. Immediately, his brows frowned slightly. That Cosmos Sack was filled with treasures, and even contained many Incomplete Imperial Armaments.

“Oh, that Chu Feng. He refused to accept my gift, and instead gave me a gift,” Baili Xuankong shook his head. However, the frown on his face had been replaced with a smile.

Chu Feng already possessed the Heavenly Immortal Sword. Thus, these Incomplete Imperial Armaments and other treasures were truly useless to him. However, to the Cyanwood Mountain, they were extremely useful. Thus, Baili Xuankong calmly accepted the contents of the Cosmos Sack.

“Milord, exactly what was that?” Dugu Xingfeng and the others asked curiously.

“Look for yourselves,” As Baili Xuankong said that, he waved his sleeve. Then, several rays of light shot out from his hand. They were the treasures in the Cosmos Sack. It was a dazzling lineup.

“Heavens?!” As the crowd saw the various treasures that were floating before them, not to mention the disciples of the younger generation, even Dugu Xingfeng and the others were gasping in admiration repeatedly. They were so shocked that their mouths were agape. After all, the items that had appeared before them were all priceless treasures.

............

After traveling for some time, Chu Feng, the Compass Immortal and Nangong Longjian arrived at a mountain range.

This mountain range was no ordinary mountain range. It was completely pitch black. Furthermore, there were purple gaseous flames soaring into the skies. Without even bothering to sense this place, one could tell with one’s naked eyes that this was an extremely dangerous place. This place... simply resembled a ghost mountain.

“Purple Flames Blackmountain? This is a forbidden area,” The Compass Immortal said as he looked to the borderless and frightening-looking mountains before them.

“That might be so. But it will not stop Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists,” Nangong Longjian said.

“Of course. Not to mention Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, this place will not be able to stop any Martial Emperor. Merely, other than possessing a frightening pressure, this place does not possess any treasure. Why did you bring us here?” The Compass Immortal asked curiously.

“What I needed is precisely the pressure of this place,” Nangong Longjian smiled slightly. Then, he leapt into the Purple Flames Blackmountain.

Chu Feng and the Compass Immortal looked to one another. Then, they both leapt into the Purple Flames Blackmountain to follow Nangong Longjian. They wanted to know what Nangong Longjian’s true intentions were.
