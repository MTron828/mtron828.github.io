Chapter 5817: Stepping into the Land of Dao Creation

Chapter 5817: Stepping into the Land of Dao Creation

“Let’s go.”

Chu Feng rose into the air, and Little Fishy followed closely behind. The others raised their heads to look at them; it was not because they were worried about the two of them but because they wanted to learn from their experience.

“This...”

They quickly realized there was no way to learn from their experience.

Chu Feng and Little Fishy ascended at a speed neither too fast nor slow, but their flight was smooth and unimpeded. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had reached the depth of the sky, where the golden light shone.

As they came into contact with the golden light, a golden door appeared. With it came a pressure that was even greater than before.

The hearts of the juniors clenched up when they sensed the pressure, as they could sense its destructive prowess. Fortunately, the pressure was only exerted on Chu Feng and Little Fishy.

Chu Feng could withstand the pressure, but even he had to concede it was a formidable force. He reflexively glanced at Little Fishy, only to see her looking over with eyes brimming with worry. They were both worried about each other.

The two of them understood each other’s intentions and burst into laughter.

“Big brother, you’re amazing. Even my brother struggles to catch up with me,” Little Fishy said.

Chu Feng understood her drift. Xianhai Shaoyu must have often been with her during her cultivation, but there were often times he couldn’t catch up with her. Her words were intended to tease her brother, but they also hinted at her terrifying talent.

After all, Xianhai Shaoyu was known to be the most talented prodigy in the world of cultivation before Little Fishy.

Just then, a voice echoed from below, “Little sister, why are you talking bad about me in public? Did you forget to switch to voice transmission?”

It was Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Nonsense. I’m merely speaking the truth,” Little Fishy retorted.

“See! It looks like older brothers mean nothing in the face of love!” Xianhai Shaoyu exclaimed.

He even glanced at Long Chengyu and the others, but no one dared to say a word, except for one person.

“M-m-makes sense. Brother Shaoyu, d-d-don’t be sad. It’s not that you aren’t good but that Brother Chu Feng is too o-o-outstanding,” Wang Qiang replied with a grin.

However, Xianhai Shaoyu didn’t continue teasing his little sister, as Chu Feng and Little Fishy had already advanced deeper into the golden light.

The powerful silhouettes in the golden light retreated to the sides, opening a path of the two of them. At the same time, the golden door opened.

Chu Feng and Little Fishy entered the golden door.

“It doesn’t look as difficult as I thought,” Qin Xuan said.

“Are you sure? I think it only looks easy because it’s the two of them.” Feng Ling looked at Qin Xuan in disdain.

“Ah...” Qin Xuan scratched his head awkwardly, as he thought Feng Ling’s words made sense.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Little Fishy found themselves entering a vast world filled with little firefly-sized specks of light that blocked their vision. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

These specks of light charged over and attacked the two of them. While their attacks didn’t leave behind injuries or damage their clothes, they still inflicted pain, making it mental torture.

Chu Feng was able to swiftly adapt to the pain, but it was only because he had a strong mind. He worriedly looked at Little Fishy, and to his relief, the latter was fine even though she didn’t look as relaxed as before.

“Look there, big brother,” Little Fishy called out.

Chu Feng looked over and saw a floating white tower not too far away. A plaque hanging above the white tower’s entrance revealed its beautiful name—Cloud Crane Tower. However, there was a formation around the white tower that prevented him from peering in or approaching it.

“There’s another one there,” Little Fishy said as she gestured toward another tower.

“There’s a palace there too!” Little Fishy exclaimed.

The specks of light limited their vision, but they could still roughly spot seven to eight buildings in their vicinity. These buildings varied in their sizes and forms—some were towers, some were pavilions, and some were palaces. They had different names and formations around them.

“They appear to have been left behind by the other dao creators,” Chu Feng said.

“It looks like we’ll have to construct our own structure. Big brother, are these specks of light materials for our building?” Little Fishy asked.

“I think so.” Chu Feng nodded.

They had previously learned the way to build structures with their bloodline powers from the runes they had deciphered before entering the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation. The main material was their bloodline power, but they needed to use the specks of light too.

Through his observation, Chu Feng noticed that the specks of light were gathered in clusters of different colors. The specks of light attacking him and Little Fishy were white, but he could spot specks of light of other colors in the distance too. They had their own domains and didn’t cross in each other's.

Different colored specks of light had different levels of potency.

“There are tiers to the materials too. The black and golden specks of light should be the best materials,” Chu Feng said. He could tell that the black and golden specks of light were of the same tier.

“Big brother, which one do you prefer?” Little Fishy asked.

“The golden speck of light is great, but I’m more interested in the black specks of light,” Chu Feng replied.

“I’ll choose the same one as you.”

“All right. Come with me.”

The black specks of light were a distance away from them.

Along the way, they encountered other-colored specks of light. They learned that the specks of light had a specific attack range. For instance, the white specks of light stopped attacking them once they were a distance away, but the other-colored specks of light attacked them when they stepped into their territory.

Chu Feng and Little Fishy chose to slowly make their way through the territories of the other-colored specks of light to adapt to their attacks. The golden and black specks of light were the strongest energies here, and it would be dangerous to directly challenge them without getting accustomed to the other powers.

Chu Feng was initially worried about Little Fishy, but he soon realized that she was able to keep up with his tempo. While he relied on his mental fortitude to withstand the pain, Little Fishy had a unique way of breathing to cope with the pain.

That being said, her mental fortitude was amazing too, as the specks of light attacked not just their souls but their minds too.
