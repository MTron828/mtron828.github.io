Chapter 5600: Good Begets Good

“I’m not an ordinary Gold Dragon God-cloak,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

The old man tossed away the Exalted Armament saber with a flick of his sleeves and kneeled on the floor, crying, “Milord, spare my life! Please spare my life! I was foolish and deserve to die a thousand times over for my sins, but please be magnanimous and spare me this once!”

Seeing that he was outmatched here, the old man chose to beg for his life, knowing that he would die if they continued fighting. At the very least, there might still be a sliver of hope if he begged for mercy.

The other clansmen kneeled down to kowtow to Chu Feng too. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Two pieces of news. One, I’m not from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, so you don’t have to worry about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Chu Feng said.

“Thank you, milord. Thank you, milord!” The old man kowtowed even harder, thinking that Chu Feng was planning to spare him.

However, Chu Feng spoke up yet again, “Two, you tried to kill me earlier. And I don’t have a habit of sparing the lives of those who have made an attempt on my life.”

Chu Feng manifested a formation sword and pushed it toward the old man.

The old man quickly activated his movement skill to dodge Chu Feng’s attack.

Pu!

Fresh blood spurted. Chu Feng’s sword still pierced through his chest and pinned him to the ground. The gap in their fighting prowess was so massive that the old man stood no chance against Chu Feng at all.

Chu Feng pulled out his sword, causing blood to splatter once more. He intended to kill the old man, but he wasn’t planning to let the latter die that easily because he still had questions to ask.

Just as Chu Feng was about to make his move, a small hand grabbed his leg. It was the bullied boy.

“Big brother, please don’t kill our clan chief. Please, there wouldn’t be my father if there is no clan chief, and I wouldn’t have been here if not for my father. Please spare Lord Clan Chief!” the boy cried.

“Milord, please show mercy and spare my grandfather. I’m begging you,” the middle-aged man kneeled down and begged on the old man’s behalf.

“You want to beg for them despite what they have done to you?” Chu Feng asked.

“No matter what, he’s still my grandfather. Today’s affairs happened because of me and my son. We’ll never be able to live in peace if you kill him. Milord, if you have to kill someone, please kill me instead and spare my grandfather,” the middle-aged man cried.

His words struck a chord in Chu Feng’s heart. Not everyone could be as vicious-hearted as to kill their family members just because they had let them down. Even Chu Feng had chosen to forgive the Chu Clan too.

Chu Feng didn’t doubt the middle-aged man when he said that he would feel guilt-ridden for his entire life if he killed the old man, and that wasn’t what Chu Feng intended.

“Fine. I’ll make an exception and spare you this once on your grandson’s account, but my exceptions come at a price,” Chu Feng said as he cast a glance at the copper mirror.

“Milord, this treasure is beyond my means to deal with, not to mention that I have erred greatly today. I’m more than willing to offer this treasure to milord as compensation for the folly I have committed today.” Despite his injuries, the old man kneeled before Chu Feng and presented the copper mirror to the latter with both hands.

Upon receiving the copper mirror, Chu Feng tried its effects on the surrounding crowd. The copper mirror revealed the protective formations they had, be it spirit power formations or martial power formations. The chances were that Chu Feng’s protective formation didn’t appear because the one his father had left in him was concealed too well.

However, Chu Feng noticed that the treasure was in an inactive state and could be activated, just that the activation method was difficult for even world spiritists to grasp, let alone cultivators. Nevertheless, he was still able to see through it with his Heaven’s Eyes.

He quickly grasped the activation method and tried out the copper mirror once more. There was no difference for those without protective formations, but those with protective formations were now divided into different intensities of light.

He then turned the mirror toward himself.

Weng!

The mirror emanated a powerful beam of light that instantaneously caught everyone’s attention. The crowd’s faces turned as pale as a sheet of paper. Some of their lower jaws fell slackened. In particular, the old man’s body trembled so much that it looked like he was going to shake his own skin out.

Seeing how brilliant Chu Feng looked through the mirror, he couldn’t believe that he actually thought Chu Feng didn’t have a protective formation? Chu Feng’s protective formation was so strong that it was beyond his wildest imagination!

“I was blind! I was blind!” The old man burst into tears, knowing that he had committed a grievous mistake by daring to offend someone like that.

Chu Feng was in a good mood.

On the one hand, he verified how powerful the protective formation his father planted in him was, though he had known about it all this while. What delighted him more was how he had acquired such a useful copper mirror while attempting to do a good deed.

This was a true treasure!

Perhaps this is what they meant by good begets good, Chu Feng thought as he stowed away the copper mirror. He turned to the old man and asked, “Where did you obtain this treasure?”

“Milord, I stumbled upon this treasure at a vendor while roaming the lands many years ago. The copper mirror was sealed by a power, and the seller was a weak cultivator who failed to recognize the value of the treasure, so I was able to get it for cheap,” the old man said.

As if fearing that Chu Feng wouldn’t believe his words, he raised his hand and vowed, “Milord, I swear that my words are the absolute truth. May lightning strike on me if there’s any falsehood in my words.”

Chu Feng turned his attention away from the old man and began constructing a formation. Three bundles of light revolved in his palm, and he flicked them into the heads of the old man, the middle-aged man, and the boy.

“Your souls are tied together from this day onward. Should any of you die, the other two will suffer the same fate,” Chu Feng told the old man.

“Milord, please be assured that I’ll treat Hai’er and Qiang’er well from this day onward. I won’t allow any grievances to befall them!” The old man knew that Chu Feng had constructed the formation to curb him, so he quickly made a vow.

“I hope that you can keep your promise. If I ever learn that the two of them are still being bullied by the other clansmen, I’ll massacre your entire clan. I am aware that your clan has committed many atrocities over the years. It’d be my sin if I spared you, only for you to do more evildoings in the future, so I suggest you do more kind acts in the future to make up for your sins.

“I am a busybody, so I have already left imprints in your bodies. I’ll be checking on you from time to time. If you don’t do as I have told you, your good days will come to an end,” Chu Feng said.

“Milord, I am grateful to you for sparing our lives. I’ll surely do as you have told us to and do good for the rest of our lives,” the old man promised.

Chu Feng turned to the boy standing beside him. The latter looked at him with eyes brimming with tears as he said, “Thank you, big brother.”

The boy understood that Chu Feng had stepped in because of him despite his young age, and he vaguely sensed that his destiny was going to change as a result of this encounter.

“Be filial to your father.” Chu Feng patted the boy’s head before rising into the air and disappearing from the crowd’s sight.

As soon as he was gone, the clansmen quickly gathered around their clan chief and cried.

“Lord Clan Chief, did you see it? That man has such a powerful protective formation! Given the strength he has displayed, he must have a frightening background. What should we do? Will he really destroy our clan?”

They were afraid that Chu Feng would go after them in the future, especially since they knew that he could easily deal with them.

“What are you crying for? Useless things!” the old man howled, but his legs suddenly caved in and he fell on his bum. In truth, there was no one more frightened than him here. “Relay my orders. From this day onward, Hai’er and Qiang’er are the most important people in our clan. Anyone who dares to take even a single strand of their hair will be executed by me!”

The old man’s voice was tinged with killing intent, but no one was surprised to hear that. They knew that Chu Feng would blame them if any mishap befell the father or the son, which would then spell the end of their clan.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was witnessing the sight from the sky.

“You have really managed to intimidate them. I reckon that the two of them will live much better lives from this day onward. This world really only looks at strength. A simple gesture from you can easily change another person’s fate,” Eggy said.

Chu Feng chuckled under his breath. While he had interfered out of kindness, he had made an unexpected gain as a result of that.

Just as he was about to head to where Long Xiaoxiao was, he suddenly halted his footsteps and turned around.

“Hm?”

A far distance away from him, a pillar of light surged into the sky before spreading outward to reveal a starry sky. The starry sky looked reminiscent of the vast world of cultivation, showing the beauty of the Nine Galaxies.

“What’s that? Is it a phenomenon?” Eggy asked.

“It doesn’t look like a phenomenon. It looks more like some kind of special place has opened, and that’s the announcement for its opening,” Chu Feng said.

“Special place? Is it a remnant?”

“That’s possible.” Chu Feng gazed down and saw that the clansmen beneath were drawn to the phenomenon too. “They might know a thing or two about this.”
