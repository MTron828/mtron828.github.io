Chapter 4949: Chu Feng’s Means

The crowd fell silent upon seeing the sight inside the palace. Everyone was shocked.

Wasn’t Chu Feng supposed to be dead? Why was he still up and moving?

More importantly, the formation dagger he was holding in his hand was clearly no ordinary dagger. Despite its ordinary appearance, it was actually an extremely powerful formation. A formation of such caliber couldn’t be manifested at a whim. It was bound to take a lot of time and effort. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“How did Chu Feng do it?” Princess Xiaoxiao asked after a moment of silence.

“Could it be that his earlier mistakes were made intentionally? He was trying to mislead his enemy into thinking that he had screwed up, but in truth, he was setting up a concealment and dagger formation. That’s the only way the earlier situation could be explained,” Daoist Niantian remarked in astonishment.

If what he said was true, Chu Feng’s proficiency in world spiritist techniques would be far stronger than they had imagined. The difficulty of pulling that off was even higher than what they thought he was attempting earlier.

“That’s likely to be the case. Chu Feng truly is a bundle of surprise,” Master Yin Ren added.&nbsp;

He stared at Chu Feng with a deep gaze filled with amazement and another hidden emotion. No one could tell for sure what was on his mind.&nbsp;

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief arrived at the same conjecture too.&nbsp;

Their guesses were spot-on.

Chu Feng had planned to set up three formations from the very start. One was a disguise formation, one was a concealment formation, and the final one was a dagger formation.&nbsp;

The intention of the concealment formation was to deceive everyone into thinking that Chu Feng was a goner, thus making them put their guard down. In fact, the delicate formation that he constructed at the very start was none other than the concealment formation.&nbsp;

It was not that Chu Feng was unable to continuously construct such a delicate formation for 45 minutes straight. It did pose a challenge to him, but it was definitely within his means to pull off. It was just that he had observed Situ Gouyue’s means, and he knew that even if he constructed the strongest formation he had on hand, he still wouldn’t be a match for the latter.&nbsp;

He would have to rely on his wits if he wished to win the duel.&nbsp;

Thus, under the cover of the concealment formation, he secretly set up a dagger formation. He waited patiently till everyone thought that he was dead to secretly approach Situ Gouyue and land a critical hit.&nbsp;

The silhouette that was burned to cinders earlier was nothing but a substitute.

It was through this set of maneuvers that Chu Feng managed to sever Situ Gouyue’s arm without alarming anyone.

“Despicable brat from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, you’re courting death!”

The crowd from the Situ World Spiritist Clan managed to figure out what Chu Feng had done, but it only angered them. At the same time, the look of pain reflected on Situ Gouyue’s face started to fade as well.&nbsp;

Even though Chu Feng had severed his arm, he was able to easily suppress the pain and regrow a new one using his spirit power.&nbsp;

“An assault? Did you think that you can defeat me with just this?”&nbsp;

Situ Gouyue glared at Chu Feng with frosty eyes.

“You have already lost. I’ll play with you if you wish to continue the battle… but are you sure about it? You’ll only further embarrass yourself at this rate,” Chu Feng said.

“Further embarrass myself? Who gave you the guts to say such words? I, Situ Gouyue, will show you the huge gap between us today!”&nbsp;

Situ Gouyue raised his arm and released a huge ripple of aura. Even the mere shockwave from the release of the ripple was enough to push Chu Feng back.&nbsp;

Knowing that the situation wasn’t to his advantage, Chu Feng quickly retreated to the corner of the palace. Even though the space in the palace was larger than what it appeared on the outside, there was still a boundary to it.&nbsp;

Situ Gouyue watched leisurely as Chu Feng backed away. He wasn’t in a hurry to chase the latter. He was confident that everything was still in his grasp.&nbsp;

In his view, Chu Feng was already as good as a dead man.&nbsp;

“Is that the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s bloodline? But how is his bloodline that powerful? It’s even more terrifying than the formation he has constructed earlier on!”&nbsp;

The crowd from the Zhuge Clan, Daoist Niantian, and the others were shocked.&nbsp;

As world spiritists themselves, they could sense just how terrifying the power exerted by Situ Gouyue was. It was a massive power-up.&nbsp;

Situ Gouyue’s formation was already terrifying in its own rights, but the aura he emanated was even more frightening, to the point where it brought about despair.&nbsp;

The despairing aura seemed to represent Situ Gouyue’s anger as it swiftly suffused the palace, drowning out a tenth of its vast space within moments.&nbsp;

“This is too scary! Is this how powerful the prodigies from the other galaxies are? Is there such a huge gap between us?”&nbsp;

Putting aside outstanding prodigies like Princess Xiaoxiao and Zhuge Feiluan, even Shengguang Buyu and Shengguang Baimei felt despaired too.&nbsp;

If such was the gap between them, it would be impossible for their Holy Light Galaxy to catch up with the others.&nbsp;

“Is this the prowess of this palace? Truly amazing.”

While everyone was intimidated by Situ Gouyue’s powers, Chu Feng let out a soft chuckle. One could easily hear the derision in his voice.&nbsp;

Everyone immediately turned their gaze toward Chu Feng. They couldn’t understand how Chu Feng was able to remain composed despite the situation he was in.

Then, Chu Feng did something utterly baffling.&nbsp;

All this while, he was holding onto Situ Gouyue’s severed arm, even as if retreated to the corner of the palace. He stabbed his formation dagger into the arm and slit an opening in it. Then, he plunged his hand into the arm.&nbsp;

“What’s Chu Feng doing? Is he out of his mind?”

The crowd couldn’t understand what Chu Feng was up to.

However, when Chu Feng finally pulled his hand out of the severed arm, the eyes of the crowd widened in realization. Putting aside Daoist Niantian and the others, even Situ Gouyue, the blue-cloaked woman, and everyone from the Situ World Spiritist Clan was astounded.&nbsp;

There was an additional item in Chu Feng’s hands. It was a miniature white crystal that was even smaller than a pearl. It gave off an aura identical to that of the palace, just even purer.&nbsp;

But what was more important was that no one had noticed it previously. It was only when Chu Feng tore it out of Situ Gouyue’s severed arm that the crowd was finally able to sense its aura.
