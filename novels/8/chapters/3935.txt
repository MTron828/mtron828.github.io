Chapter 3935 - Fighting Over Him?

As they continued onward, the oppression grew stronger and stronger. Pang Bo found it more and more difficult to endure it.

Chu Feng suggested for Pang Bo to leave him and continue on his own.

However, Pang Bo was beyond stubborn. He insisted on journeying with Chu Feng. He declared that he would drag Chu Feng with him if he must, and would only stop should he himself not be able to move anymore.

Suddenly, a mocking voice was heard, “Oh my, if this isn’t young master Pang?”

“You’re really helping that boy?”

“Could it be that you think he’ll reward you with an Immortal Armament?”

Looking to the voice, it was the baldy and his group.

They were all sitting ahead, panting and drenched in sweat. It would appear that they were unable to go any further themselves.

The person who’d spoken those mocking words was that baldy.

That baldy actually did not fear Pang Bo. When he said that he was going to give him face earlier, he only did so to give himself a way out of the difficult situation. The person he was actually afraid of was Chu Feng.

Even though he was unable to understand why a True Immortal would cause him to feel so uneasy, cause him to feel instinctive fear and make him cower, he became more and more sullen the more he thought about things after cowering to Chu Feng.

That was the reason why he decided to taunt Chu Feng and Pang Bo again when he saw them.

He was venting his displeasure.

As for Pang Bo, he completely ignored the baldy’s taunts. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, as you can see, it’s not you who’s burdening me. Instead, all of us are unable to proceed any further.”

“There’s still quite some distance to reach the Spirit Spring Water from here. I think that not even peak Heavenly Immortals will be able to reach it. Only Martial Immortals will be able to.”

Pang Bo decided to stop trying to move forward. With a ‘putt’ he sat on the ground. Seeing how Pang Bo was panting heavily, Chu Feng knew that he was truly exhausted.

“As matters stand, there’s no other choice.”

Chu Feng did not sit down. Instead, he stood perfectly straight, cleared his throat and shouted loudly, “Everyone! As the saying goes, one depends on one’s parents at home, and on one’s friends away from home. I am Asura. Today, my body is unwell, and my cultivation ended up suffering. Because of that, I am trapped here, and unable to proceed further.”

“If anyone is willing to help me, I will definitely express my gratitude properly.”

Chu Feng’s words immediately caught the attention of many people.

However, the ones to react the most were the baldy’s group.

“Motherfucker! That scammer! He’s starting it again!” cursed the baldy.

That being said, his curse was spoken very quietly. It was like a quiet mutter.

“That guy is simply too shameless. If he continues to act this way, he will definitely receive a beating.”

“Beating? The way I see it, he wouldn’t even have the chance to receive a beating. After all, no one will pay attention to him.”

The baldy’s friends began to mock Chu Feng repeatedly.

Compared to the baldy, his friends were much louder.

However, Chu Feng completely ignored their ridicule. No matter what sort of discussion the bystanders were having, he continued to shout loudly.

Even though people were passing by him in succession and, apart from sneering and ridiculing him, showed no signs of being interested in helping him, Chu Feng was not discouraged.

Although he was not discouraged, Pang Bo was unable to continue looking on.

“Brother Asura, the people of this place are always cold and detached towards others. No one will help you,” said Pang Bo.

“Who said that? Didn’t you help me?” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“It is not that I, Pang Bo, am boasting. However, I am indeed different from them. However, I’ve grown up here. Thus, I know them better than anyone else.”

Pang Bo’s ‘I know them better than anyone else’ revealed how disappointed he was in those people..

“Brother Asura, let’s just wait. My father will definitely come to my assistance after finding that I still didn’t return after so long,” said Pang Bo.

“Very well. Let’s wait awhile then,” as Chu Feng spoke, he sat down too.

Chu Feng was actually not panicking. After all, he knew what his cultivation was.

Furthermore, Chu Feng knew very well that even though the enormous lightning beasts and Sacred Tree Seed were battling, it was only temporary. Sooner or later, they would come to a halt. At that time, he would be able to regain his cultivation.

However, right after Chu Feng sat down, a woman’s voice sounded from behind him.

“Young master, are you planning to give up?”

Chu Feng turned around and looked behind him. He discovered that a woman was standing behind him and looking at him with a beaming smile.

That woman was not particularly good-looking. However, her smile was very sweet. That smile gave off a feeling of amiability.

“Senior sister, we’re total strangers. It’s better that we ignore him,” at that moment, another voice was heard from behind that woman.

A group of people arrived behind her. There were both men and women in the group. They all wore the same attire. It appeared that they were from the same sect.

Furthermore, regardless of their gender, they were all very young. They should all be people of the younger generation.

“They’re people from the Scarlet Wind Pavilion.”

“That person, she couldn’t possibly be the Scarlet Wind Pavilion’s Mu Ziwei, right?”

“Mu Ziwei? It really does seem to be Mu Ziwei.”

That woman immediately caused a commotion with her appearance.

Chu Feng learned from the crowd’s conversations that the Scarlet Wind Pavilion was a very strong power in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

As for Mu Ziwei, she was a genius younger generation renowned throughout the entire Reincarnation Upper Realm.

It was no wonder that she, a person of the younger generation, was able to reach them without any change in her expression.

Chu Feng suspected that Mu Ziwei’s cultivation was most definitely not that of an ordinary Martial Immortal. He felt that it was very possible that her cultivation was approaching peak Martial Immortal.

At that moment, Mu Ziwei’s fellow disciples were all urging her to not meddle in other people’s business.

However, Mu Ziwei merely waved her hand to indicate to her fellow disciples to quiet down.

This Mu Ziwei most definitely possessed a great deterrence power amongst the crowd. Thus, after her signal, although the people behind her were very unwilling, they still shut their mouths.

“Young master, you still didn’t answer me. Why did you sit down? Are you planning to give up?”

With a smile on her face, Mu Ziwei blinked her large eyes as she questioned Chu Feng.

Seeing that, Chu Feng stood back up and asked, “If I didn’t give up, young lady, are you willing to help me?”

“They said that you’re a scammer. If young master scams me, what will happen then?” asked Mu Ziwiei.

“If I am to scam young lady, young lady can kill me. Would that work?” said Chu Feng.

“Truly? I will not be lenient with you,” said Mu Ziwei.

“Truly,” Chu Feng spoke with a look of determination.

“Very well. Straightforward and frank, I like young master’s personality. Since that’s the case, I will help you,” said Mu Ziwei.

“In that case, may I know what sort of reward young lady desires?” asked Chu Feng.

“I admire your courage. Thus, I will not demand a reward. I am helping you for free.” Mu Ziwei laughed.

“What? For free?”

Hearing those words, the crowd all revealed looks of shock.

It turned out that Mu Ziwei had been testing Chu Feng earlier. She had never planned to demand a reward from him.

‘That scammer is simply too lucky.’

‘That scammer actually managed to obtain the renowned Mu Ziwei’s help so easily?’

‘Could it be that superbly talented women are all so easily deceived?’

At that moment, the crowd began to discuss this spiritedly. More than anything, they felt envious and jealous of Chu Feng. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This was especially true for that baldy and his friends, who were unable to proceed onward like Chu Feng would now be able to. They felt so envious that they looked like they were about to cry.

“There’s no need to trouble young lady, I will help him.”

Right at that moment, another woman’s voice sounded.

Looking towards the voice, two figures were approaching. Even Chu Feng was surprised to see those people. The reason for that was because he knew them.

They were Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an.

However, compared to Chu Feng, the bystanders were completely shocked.

This was especially true for the men. They were all looking very unwell.

After all, compared to Mu Ziwei, Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an were real beauties.

Especially Linghu Yueyue. It would not be excessive to say that she was a devastating beauty capable of causing the downfall of a city or state.

However, beauty was not the most important aspect. Most importantly, Linghu Yueyue also showed no signs of difficulty on her face.

Even though the crowd didn’t know who she was, they were able to guess from her relaxed appearance that she was someone with an outstanding cultivation.

Most likely, she was a genius that was not inferior to Mu Ziwei.

“Young lady, could it be that you’re planning to fight over him with me?” Mu Ziwei asked Linghu Yueyue.

“What will you do if I am planning to fight over him with you?” asked Linghu Yueyue.

‘What? Fighting over him?’

‘These two exceptionally talented women are actually fighting over who gets to help that trash, that scammer?’

‘What is this?’

“Fuck! What the hell is this?! Exactly what sort of dog shit luck does that scammer have?!”

The baldy’s face turned green with anger.
