Chapter 5688: Ling Canghai’s Death

Chu Feng would have been in danger if Ling Canghai’s protection formation had activated and drawn attention here. However, he quickly realized that the chains were a sealing formation that had not just sealed off Ling Canghai’s body but his treasures too.

He tried using Protection Bane on the sealing formation, but it was to no avail. Protection Bane only worked on protection formations.

“That cunning old thing is disgusting even after he’s dead,” Chu Feng cursed.

He walked up to the copper cauldron and toppled it with a kick. An incomplete pill carrying an awful blood stench floated out of the cauldron.

This pill had been forged with the bloodlines of countless people over tens of thousands of years. Chu Feng would never consume such a pill, not to mention it was incomplete and he couldn’t tell what it was for.

Even so, he still took away the blood pill and the pill cauldron, not wanting to leave them for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Then, he stowed Ling Canghai’s head into his Cosmos Sack with a wave of his sleeves before quickly leaving the area via Divine Flitting.

“Lord Chu Feng, how can you move so fast?” the Asura King asked in astonishment.

His cultivation was only at rank nine Half-God level, but Chu Feng was moving as fast as normal rank two True God level cultivators.

“It’s a divine skill. It’s a relief that the old man didn’t erect a barrier, else I wouldn’t have been able to take his life that easily,” Chu Feng replied.

“I see. Lord Chu Feng is indeed destined for great things,” the Asura King remarked.

“I’m just lucky, though my luck isn’t good today. If not for that old man’s sealing formation, I’d have been able to gather quite some treasures from him,” Chu Feng said regretfully.

…

Meanwhile, Ling Mouzi, Jie Zhenfu, Jie Qinghe, and a few other high-standing elders were gathered in a bamboo forest.

“I’ve kept all of you waiting.”

A person descended from the sky. It was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

“Paying respects to Lord Mansion Master!” The important figures of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion gathered here quickly greeted him with a bow.

“I took some time to settle the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster. Is something up?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Lord Mansion Master, it’s about Chu Feng,” Ling Mouzi said.

“What’s there to talk about Chu Feng?”

“Lord Mansion Master, Ling Xinian brought Chu Feng into the Sacred Mansion today…”

“Are you talking about him clearing the Seven Stars Gravity Towers?”

“Yes, Lord Mansion Master. I didn’t know you were aware of it.”

“Is there a problem with that?”

“Lord Mansion Master, no one has cleared the Seven Stars Gravity Towers before Chu Feng, and Chu Feng is an outsider. We’re worried that our juniors will be affected by this matter, so we wish to consult you on how we should deal with it,” Ling Mouzi said.

“Chu Feng has obtained the black imprint that even Ranqing failed to in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Granted that he has benefited from Ranqing’s sealing formation, he has still achieved what no one else has. In comparison, the Seven Stars Gravity Towers isn’t a big deal. Our juniors have been slacking off recently, so it’s a good thing for Chu Feng to stress them a little. You may leave this matter be,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

“We understand,” Ling Mouzi replied.

Both Elder Zhenfu and Elder Qinghe smiled.

“Elder Ling, I’ve already told you that there’s no need to alarm Lord Mansion Master on this. Lord Mansion Master knows Chu Feng’s talent better than you do,” Elder Zhenfu remarked.

“Nevertheless, I still think it’s necessary to consult Lord Mansion Master on this. This concerns how our juniors view Chu Feng in the future, after all,” Ling Mouzi said.

“That’s true,” Elder Zhenfu agreed.

“You need not intervene in Chu Feng’s relationship with our juniors. He might be talented, but there’s no guarantee about his future. Just let things be,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“We understand,” the elders replied.

“Lord Mansion Master.” An elder suddenly ran over with a look of fluster.

“What happened?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Something bad has happened!” The elder whipped out a life token inscribed with the name ‘Ling Canghai’, but the token had shattered and was devoid of any hints of life.

“Lord Canghai has passed away?”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and his elders were taken aback.

“That isn’t right. We just met Lord Canghai earlier in the day, and he was doing well. Why would he pass away all of a sudden?” Ling Mouzi sensed that something was amiss.

Shoosh!

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master vanished from the spot.

The other elders quickly followed him, but they were nowhere as fast. When they arrived at Ling Canghai’s residence, they were surprised to find an underground palace. Their faces scrunched up when they entered the underground palace and smelled the strong blood stench within.

Their shocked expressions indicated that they weren’t aware of this underground palace.

They went deeper into the underground palace, and it didn’t take them long to reach its end. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was already standing there with Ling Canghai’s corpse.

“Lord Canghai.”

The crowd was taken aback. Some of them even burst into tears. Those from the older generation understood Ling Canghai’s significance to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“It’s a cultivator,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master touched Ling Canghai’s neck and remarked. His eyebrows shot up as he coldly ordered, “Investigate all of the True God level cultivators who have recently entered or are currently residing in the mansion!”

“Understood!” the elders replied as they prepared to leave. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master suddenly spoke up, “Wait. Don’t spread news about Lord Canghai’s death yet. Make sure you don’t mention anything about this underground palace to the others too. I won’t show any mercy to any of you if you dare sully Lord Canghai’s reputation.”

Those words carried killing intent.

“We understand!”

The elders implicitly sensed that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master might have known about this underground palace beforehand, but they dared not to ask about it.

They would have feigned ignorance too if they had known that Ling Canghai was committing atrocities.
