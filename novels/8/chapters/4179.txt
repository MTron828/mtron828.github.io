Chapter 4179 - No Choice But To Concede

Seeing the reaction from Long Shengbu, Long Nanxun became even more pleased with himself.

However, Long Xiaoxiao did not give the two genius world spiritists a good evaluation. In fact, she didn’t even bother to look at them.

As for Chu Feng, he was unfamiliar with the structure of the Holy Light Galaxy.

The All-heaven Heavenly Master, Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted and that Lu Jie were all people that he had heard about.

But, Chu Feng had never heard of those two genius world spiritists or their masters.

“Whilst they are indeed quite famous, I wonder if their fame is well-deserved or not,” Long Xiaoxiao mocked.

Whilst the two genius world spiritists looked down on Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao also looked down on them.

“Two brothers, teach this kid a lesson.”

“Let Xiaoxiao know who really has true abilities,” Long Nanxun said as he pointed at Chu Feng.

Long Nanxun disliked Chu Feng to begin with. He was itching for someone to teach him a ruthless lesson.

Thus, after saying those words, he looked at the fair-skinned playboy and the dark-skinned fatty. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The fair-skinned playboy by the name of Chen Guang understood his intentions. Thus, he immediately stepped forward.

“Brother, I’ve heard that you’re also a world spiritist at rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation?”

“To obtain such an accomplishment at such a young age, besides possessing exceptional talent, you must also have a renowned master providing you with guidance.”

“May I know who brother’s master is?” asked Chen Guang.

“I do not have a master,” said Chu Feng.

“No master?” Chu Feng’s answer not only surprised Chen Guang, it also surprised the others present.

However, soon, a mocking smile appeared on their faces.

“In that case, it would mean that brother is a self-made genius. That’s truly remarkable”

“Come, brother. Allow me to experience exactly how strong your world spirit techniques are.”

As Chen Guang spoke, he began to set up a spirit formation. Soon, he was finished.

What he had created was a very exquisite protective formation.

It had taken Chen Guang only half an incense stick’s worth of time to complete his spirit formation.

From this, it could be seen that he was indeed quite capable.

The people present were all able to tell how powerful Chen Guang’s spirit formation was.

Unavoidably, some praises were heard.

This made Chen Guang even more pleased with himself.

“Brother, you can set up a spirit formation in half an incense stick’s worth of time. If your spirit formation is capable of breaching this defensive formation of mine, it means that your attainments in world spirit techniques are stronger than mine,” said Chen Guang.

“Very well,” Chu Feng agreed. With that, he planned to set up his spirit formation.

However, once he began, he was immediately stunned.

Chu Feng had underestimated the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk had been in Chu Feng’s world spirit space and steadily devouring his spirit power the entire time.

Without spirit power, Chu Feng would not be able to form spirit formations.

Chu Feng thought about putting a halt to the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk to regain his spirit power, however, he was shocked to discover that he was actually unable to put a halt to the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

This was completely unexpected.

If Chu Feng could not stop the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, he would not be able to utilize any spirit power to set up a spirit formation. No matter how outstanding his abilities might be, he would not be able to put them to use.

Seeing that Chu Feng was not releasing his spirit power after so long, and that he even had an awkward expression on his face, Long Xiaoxiao asked, “Little benefactor, what’s wrong?”

“Your Highness, I am truly sorry.”

“I am currently fusing with a world spiritist treasure in my world spirit space. Because of that, my spirit power has been sealed. I am unable to use any world spirit techniques,” said Chu Feng.

“What? Unable to use any world spirit techniques?”

“If you’re unable to use any world spirit techniques, why are you here?”

“You damned scammer! I knew you were deceiving Xiaoxiao! Watch how I’ll tear you to shreds!” As Long Nanxun spoke, he planned to attack Chu Feng.

“You dare?!”

However, before Long Nanxun could do anything, Long Xiaoxiao glared at him fiercely.

Faced with Long Xiaoxiao’s anger-filled gaze, Long Nanxun immediately cowered. No matter how much he disliked Chu Feng, he did not dare to attack him.

He ended up retrieving his clenched fist in a very displeased manner, and then glared at Chu Feng again.

“Nanxun, Princess Xiaoxiao and I have personally witnessed young friend Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques. He is definitely not a scammer.”

“Since he says he’s fusing with a world spiritist treasure, he must be doing that,” added Long Shengbu.

“If you’re fusing with a world spiritist treasure, why didn’t you say so earlier? Why did you agree to the contest?”

“Isn’t he deliberately trying to embarrass Xiaoxiao here?” said Long Nanxun.

“Shut your mouth! I’m the one that’s going to embarass you!” shouted Long Xiaoxiao.

“I...”

Long Nanxun turned red with anger. However, he didn’t dare to explode at Long Xiaoxiao. As such, he ended up glaring angrily at Chu Feng again.

“It is my fault. I thought that I could put a stop to the process at any time.”

“Never did I imagine that this world spiritist treasure can’t be forcibly stopped,” said Chu Feng.

“Nonsense. When has there ever been a case where one cannot forcibly stop the fusing process with a world spiritist treasure?”

“That’s right. That’s simply unheard of.”

The fair-skinned playboy Chen Guang and the dark-skinned fatty Yue Yang both refuted Chu Feng.

Their intentions were clear; they were stating that Chu Feng was lying.

But, Chu Feng didn’t know how to explain things.

After all, in normal cases, a world spiritist could indeed put a stop to the process at any time.

That was something that all world spiritists knew. It was simply common knowledge.

It was precisely because it was common knowledge that Chu Feng had neglected it.

“Your Highness, I am truly sorry.”

“Lord Supreme Elder, I am sorry.”

“I, Chu Feng, was careless.”

Chu Feng’s heart was filled with guilt and shame.

Long Xiaoxiao had placed high hopes on him, and Long Shengbu also thought highly of him.

If that wasn’t the case, there wouldn’t be a contest of world spiritist techniques.

Although the current outcome was not what he had intended, it still greatly embarrassed Long Xiaoxiao and Long Shengbu.

Because of that, Chu Feng felt extremely guilty.

“Little benefactor, in that case, how long will it take for your treasure to finish fusing?” asked Long Xiaoxiao.

“This world spiritist treasure has surpassed my expectations. As such, even I am uncertain,” said Chu Feng.

“Uncertain? What a great excuse,” mocked Long Nanxun.

“It is understandable that you’re unable to use your world spirit techniques.”

“However, the strength of a world spiritist is actually embodied through the strength of their world spirits.”

“After all, powerful world spirits will only follow powerful masters.”

“How about this. Brother, allow this Yue Yang to compete with you,” said the dark-skinned fatty.

As he spoke, he activated his world spirit gate.

Soon, a world spirit emerged from the world spirit gate.

It was a male world spirit. He had a tall and robust build, and a handsome and grim appearance.

Most importantly, he emitted a very powerful aura.

That was a rank one Utmost Exalted-level world spirit.

‘He’s also an Asura World Spiritist?’

Chu Feng recognized right away that the world spirit was an Asura World Spirit.

After all, only an Asura World Spirit would possess that sort of aura and airs.

“Competing in world spirits? That’s a great proposal.”

“Little benefactor, call out your world spirit and teach him a lesson,” Long Xiaoxiao said with a look of expectation.

She was not the only one. Even Long Shengbu had an expectant gaze.

Even though they had witnessed Chu Feng’s martial cultivation talent and world spirit techniques, they had not yet seen his world spirits.

They wanted to know exactly what sort of world spirits Chu Feng possessed.

“Regarding that, I wouldn’t be able to compete in that either,” Chu Feng said with embarrassment.

“You can’t compete in this either? Don’t you tell me your world spirits are all in closed-door training, and thus you’re unable to call them,” said Yue Yang.

“That just so happens to be the case,” Chu Feng said with embarrassment.

“This...”

At that moment, even Long Shengbu and Fumo Xin’er were feeling embarrassed.

“Little benefactor, you couldn’t possibly be doing this on purpose, right?” Long Xiaoxiao looked to Chu Feng with suspicion.

“I’m truly not doing this on purpose. It’s simply that the timing of things are just bad,” said Chu Feng helplessly.

Due to special reasons, Chu Feng had only ever had three world spirits in his world spirit space.

Xue Ji had long departed his world spirit space. She had then ended up being captured by the Old Cat.

As for Her Lady Queen, she had entered closed-door training and hadn’t woken up since they’d found the Asura God Stone.

As for Yu Sha, she had entered closed-door training in the Reincarnation Upper Realm and still hadn’t woken up either.

“Xiaoxiao, I’m not going to say anything this time around.”

“You tell me, what are we to do about this?” said Long Nanxun.

“My apologies Princess, my apologies Lord Supreme Elder.”

“I, Chu Feng, am incompetent this time around. I admit defeat,” said Chu Feng helplessly.

He had wanted to use the opportunity to help Long Daozhi return to the Dragon Clan.

Never did he expect to end up failing so much at such a crucial time.

With the situation as it was, Chu Feng did not wish to make things difficult for Long Xiaoxiao, and thus decided to concede.
