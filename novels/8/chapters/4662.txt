Chapter 4662: The Wretched Black Demon’s True Face

“Hahaha! It looks like all of the planning I’ve done hasn’t gone to waste. In the end, it still fell into my hands!”

A gleeful smile appeared on the face of the Wretched Black Demon.

This reaction made Chu Feng realize that the amicable image the Wretched Black Demon put on previously was truly just an act. He was indeed not a trustworthy individual.

“Milord, Lord Yunliang has told us to inform you to not let down the Asura World Spirit Army. If I may ask, why do those Asura Evil Spirits value the box so much?” Chu Feng asked.

He wanted to know more about the box.

“Chu Feng, there sure are many things that you would like to know. Unfortunately, someone from the Holy Light Galaxy isn’t worthy of knowing so much!”

The Wretched Black Demon looked at Chu Feng with a malicious smile on his lips. His attitude had changed so quickly that even Gongsun Yuntian was taken aback.

Earlier, the Wretched Black Demon had shown such a high opinion of Chu Feng, even speaking up for him on many occasions. Why would he suddenly act in such a manner now?

On the other hand, Chu Feng didn’t seem too surprised by the Wretched Black Demon’s change in attitude.

“Wretched Black Demon, are you finally showing your true face after making use of me?” Chu Feng asked with a cold sneer.

“Oh? Judging from what you’re saying, you seem to know that I wouldn’t let you off?”

The Wretched Black Demon was a little surprised to see how calm Chu Feng was regarding this.

“Well, how should I put this? I did speculate the worst-case scenario, but I didn’t think that things would really proceed in this direction. It seems like you have no intention of letting me get out of here alive, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Indeed. Your very existence is a threat to our Nine Souls Galaxy. As someone from the Nine Souls Galaxy, it’s my duty to eliminate those who threaten us,” the Wretched Black Demon unhesitatingly revealed the true reason why he wanted to kill Chu Feng.

“Since I’m someone doomed for death, why don’t you satisfy my curiosity one last time? Can you tell me what’s inside the box?” Chu Feng asked.

“Like I’ve said, someone from the Holy Light Galaxy isn’t worthy of knowing that much.”

Right after saying those words, the Wretched Black Demon’s terrifying oppressive might immediately enveloped the entire hall. All it took was just a thought from him now to vanquish Chu Feng’s soul. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Seeing this, Chu Feng spat coldly and shot up his middle finger toward the Wretched Black Demon.

“Wretched Black Demon, you sure are useless trash. You didn’t even have the courage to enter the Asura Graveyard yourself, so you ended up entrusting it to me instead. Remember this, if not for me, you wouldn’t have been able to do anything at all!

“Do you dare to enter the Asura Graveyard openly? No, you don’t dare. That’s because you’re trash and a coward! To think that people call you the Wretched Black Demon! They should call you the Wretched Black Coward instead!

“And you dare to look down on our Ancestral Martial Galaxy, huh? Do you think that you’re worthy?”

Since they had already fallen out with one another, there was no need for Chu Feng to watch his mouth anymore. He immediately began hurling insults at the Wretched Black Demon without any hesitation.

Those words from Chu Feng shocked even Gongsun Yuntian. His mouth widened in sheer horror. This was the first time that a junior actually dared to insult the Wretched Black Demon in such a manner!

It was truly an audacious act!

“You rascal! You might have become something great had you been allowed to grow, but how unfortunate that you’ll never get the chance to do so!”

The enraged Wretched Black Demon flung his sleeves and channeled his oppressive might toward Chu Feng to crush him.

Weng!

However, the splatter of blood that everyone was anticipating never happened. Instead, with a slight glimmer of light, Chu Feng suddenly vanished into thin air.

“That is... a teleportation formation? He actually had such a formidable teleportation formation in his body? It’s no wonder why he dares to act so arrogantly as to insult Lord Black Demon!” Gongsun Yuntian remarked.

“Shut your mouth! Do I need you to explain what happened to me? Do you think I can’t tell that he escaped with a teleportation formation?” the Wretched Black Demon howled at Gongsun Yuntian.

Hearing that, Gongsun Yuntian quickly zipped up his mouth.

The Wretched Black Demon’s face was simply too livid at the moment that it made him feel extremely afraid that the other party would simply end his life there and then.

“How dare that darned rascal pull a fast one over me? Even if I have to flip over the entire Holy Light Galaxy, I’m going to find you!” the Wretched Black Demon spat through clenched teeth.

However, he didn’t head off to search for Chu Feng right away because he knew that the teleportation formation Chu Feng used was extraordinary. It didn’t leave behind any traces at all, such that the Wretched Black Demon had no clues where he could find Chu Feng at all.

Even though he was furious at being made a fool by Chu Feng, he knew that he had more important matters on hand right now—removing the formation on the box.

In truth, the Wretched Black Demon could have broken the box open with just a mere thought with his strength, but he dared not to do so. So, he could only slowly decipher the formation on the box bit by bit.

However, he wasn’t too worried. He had waited for many years for this, so he had more than enough patience for this.

Besides, even though the formation on the box was complicated, it didn’t pose a challenge to the Wretched Black Demon at all. It would take some time, but it would eventually be deciphered in due time.

...

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had appeared somewhere else. It was a dark cavern.

“Chu Feng, you sure are gutsy to dare insult the Wretched Black Demon like this. Aren’t you afraid of the teleportation formation in your body failing once more?” Eggy asked with a hint of fright still lingering in her voice.

She did know that Chu Feng’s body had a formation left behind by that mysterious elder, but he had failed to activate it once back at the Asura Graveyard. Given so, it was not confirmed whether Chu Feng’s teleportation formation would work in the earlier humongous hall either.

“Hahaha, rewards and risks come hand in hand,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

“Rewards and risks my ass. Your mouth is just itchy.”

Eggy was a little angry. She felt that Chu Feng was taking his life too lightly here.

“Alright alright, Milady Queen. Don’t get mad. Actually, I did try activating the formation beforehand, and it was after confirming that it was working that I provoked the Wretched Black Demon. I’m not that foolish,’ Chu Feng replied with a smile.

After that, he began to scan his surroundings.

“Eggy, why does this place feel a bit amiss?”

The reason why Chu Feng was saying this was because he realized that the cavern he was in was man made. In fact, it had inscriptions that were typically used for smelting.

This wasn’t a cavern at all. It was more like a furnace!
