Chapter 3906 - Truly Picked Up A Treasure

That said, Chu Feng had turned his head as he asked the question. He simply did not dare to look at that woman.

He was afraid that he would be charmed even more should he continue to look at her. If he were to lose control of himself, it was possible for him to be controlled by that woman.

Whilst he had no idea what the woman’s origin was, he had to stay clear-headed.

“How strange. You continue to call me senior, yet you’re unwilling to even look at me. Are you being polite, or are you lacking in manners?” asked the woman.

“This junior does not dare to be rude toward senior. That is why I do not dare to look at senior’s face,” said Chu Feng.

“The way I see it, you’re afraid of falling for me, right?”

After saying those words, the woman arrived before Chu Feng again.

However, Chu Feng was still opposing her.

“Boy, could it be that you have someone you’re fond of?”

“Could it be that that person is even more beautiful than this god?” asked the woman.

“Senior, this junior does not dare be rude. Thus, I hope that senior will conduct herself with dignity too.” Chu Feng stepped backwards again.

“Truly never would I have imagined that there’s actually a man in this world that’s not interested in this god’s beauty.”

The woman felt very surprised to see that Chu Feng was insisting on keeping his distance.

“Senior, this junior still doesn’t know who you are. Could senior tell this junior who you are?”

“Furthermore, senior, can you tell me what this junior might be able to help senior with?” asked Chu Feng.

“I indeed need your help. I need you to embrace me.”

The woman arrived before Chu Feng again. This time around, she even hugged him tightly.

No matter how much Chu Feng struggled, he was unable to break away from her.

“Senior, please don’t act this way. Senior, please respect yourself.”

Chu Feng closed his eyes and turned his head away. He tried his hardest not to be in contact with the woman.

Facing Chu Feng acting like that, the gentle expression on the woman’s face disappeared from her face.

“You’re truly not interested in this god?” she asked.

“This junior does not dare to show disrespect to senior,” said Chu Feng.

“Interesting.”

Hearing those words, the woman actually released Chu Feng and stepped back.

“You’ve passed the first trial.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng could sense the woman’s aura growing further and further away from him.

Chu Feng finally opened his eyes. Upon doing so, he discovered that the beautiful woman had transformed back into a beautiful deer. Furthermore, when Chu Feng saw her, she was already very far away from him.

The deer walked in the sky, and appeared particularly dazzling and sacred being illuminated by the sun.

Soon, the deer disappeared from Chu Feng’s sight.

“Senior, exactly who are you?!” Chu Feng asked loudly.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, his surroundings started to sway violently.

Following that, with a putt, Chu Feng fell onto his butt.

By the time Chu Feng reacted to what had happened, he discovered he had returned to Gou Za’s residence.

He was sitting on the ground. Gou Za and his grandmother were both crouched beside him, and looking at him with concern.

“Milord, what happened to you?”

Gou Za asked with a look of worry all over his face.

“I, I also want to know what happened,” said Chu Feng.

“You, you don’t know what happened to you?”

“After you put away the secret skill my grandmother handed to you, you sat down on the ground in a completely powerless manner,” said Gou Za.

“You’re saying that I sat on the ground the moment I put away the secret skill?”

“Like how I’m sitting on the ground now?”

“I was sitting on the ground earlier?” Chu Feng asked with great shock.

“That’s, that’s right.”

Gou Za was confused after being questioned repeatedly by Chu Feng.

‘Could it be, time didn’t pass in this world even though I entered that strange space earlier?’

There was basis behind why Chu Feng thought that way.

Although he had entered that strange world for a short period of time, he had still been in there for a while.

However, according to Gou Za, Chu Feng had just sat down on the ground. Furthermore, before sitting down, he had not shown any signs of abnormality.

At that moment, Chu Feng immediately put his hand on his chest.

‘Sure enough, it disappeared.’

A complicated emotion filled Chu Feng’s heart.

Actually, with his perception, he had already detected that the paper he had placed on his chest had disappeared.

The reason why he bothered to touch his chest with his hand was merely to confirm it.

Chu Feng then lowered his head and looked to his chest.

He discovered that there was no sign of any changes to his chest.

Following that, Chu Feng used his gaze to see through his chest. He wanted to check out his soul.

Upon doing so, he discovered that there was indeed something on his chest.

It was located where his heart was. There was a painting on his heart.

The painting was that of the deer he had encountered in that strange world. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The only difference was that this painting was no longer a scribble. Instead, it was identical to the deer, and extremely beautiful.

“Ssss~~~”

Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from breathing in a mouthful of cold air.

He felt rather disoriented. Even his reaction had slowed somewhat.

As matters stood, he was able to confirm a few things.

Gou Za’s grandmother had not lied. That paper was indeed extremely extraordinary. However, it was not a simple secret skill.

Besides that, the deer Chu Feng had encountered in that mysterious space; the deer that was able to transform into that beauty, was even more extraordinary.

Even though she hadn’t unleashed any oppressive might at Chu Feng, he was able to sense how powerful she was.

Otherwise, it would be impossible for her to be able to charm Chu Feng so intangibly like that.

If it wasn’t for Chu Feng’s firm willpower, he would likely have made a mistake.

If he were to have made that sort of mistake, the outcome would have definitely been very bad.

After all, the woman had stated that Chu Feng had passed the first trial.

This meant that her intimate behavior towards him had been nothing more than a test.

Fortunately, he had remained composed, and was not someone who took advantage of others.

Otherwise, he definitely would have failed the trial.

Who knew what sort of outcome failing the trial would have?

Chu Feng was able to confirm that he was no match for the woman. In fact, he could tell that there was an enormous difference between him and that woman.

Most importantly, that woman had declared herself to be a ‘god’, and had denied that she was a secret skill.

In that case, exactly what was she?

Confused, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Gou Za’s grandmother. “Grandma, exactly what is the origin of the Ancient Era’s secret skill you gave me earlier?”

As matters stood, Gou Za’s grandmother was the only person who could give him answers.

Since she had said that the paper was their family’s generational treasure, she must know of its origin.

Seeing the curiosity on Chu Feng’s face, Gou Za’s grandmother did not hesitate, and immediately began to tell him about the paper.

After hearing her explanations, Chu Feng became endlessly overjoyed and excited.

He had confirmed that he had picked up a treasure.

Indeed, he had truly picked up a treasure without paying any price. It was like he’d just been casually walking on the street when he came across a priceless treasure.

How could anyone not be ecstatic if such a thing were to happen to them?
