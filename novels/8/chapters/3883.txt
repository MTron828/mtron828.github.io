Chapter 3883 - The Dusky Palace Hall

Seeing the person lying on the ground, the crowd’s expressions all changed.

Tuoba Chengan and others were all carefully observing that person.

They wanted to know exactly what sort of person someone who dared to make an enemy of them was like.

However, as light was revolving around the body of the person lying on the ground, they were simply unable to see his appearance.

Soon, many elders from the All-heaven Sect shouted furiously, “It’s him! Lord Supreme Elder, this is the guy who stole our treasures!”

Through their words. Tuoba Chengan confirmed his guess. Sure enough, this was one of their enemies.

“Who are you?! What is your relationship with that Asura?!” asked Tuoba Chengan.

“Humph. This Exalted is Young Master Asura’s subordinate, one of the Eighteen Saintly Exalted,” said the person lying on the ground.

Even though he had a very sorry appearance, his voice was extremely tough and overbearing.

It was as if he was a ruler of the world.

“Eighteen Saintly Exalted?”

The expressions of the All-heaven Sect’s elders grew tense upon hearing that title.

Then, they looked at each other in dismay. Deep unease appeared in their eyes.

What were they afraid of?

What they were most afraid of was that Asura being supported by powerful experts.

After hearing what that person said, they realized that the situation was rather bad.

“You dare touch this Exalted? It seems that you don’t know how powerful this Exalted is!”

Right at that moment, the person that was originally lying on the ground suddenly stood up.

After standing up, his body began to float upward.

At the same time, the light that was revolving around him grew brighter. That light was actually able to affect his surroundings.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, the mountains started to crumble, and the earth started to shatter. Even space itself was shaking violently. Facing that immense power, even Tuoba Chengan started frowning.

He was able to tell that their opponent possessed enormous power.

Not even he was certain he would be able to defeat him.

Most importantly, his opponent’s power was extremely strange. It was not martial power, nor was it purely world spirit power. However, it was still extremely powerful, and gave off a very sacred sensation.

It seemed like a power that was capable of ruling over everything and altering fate.

Seeing that power, one would feel reverence toward it, and not dare blaspheme it.

“Wuuuahh~~~”

However, all of a sudden, that person who had floated into the sky let out a scream. Then, like a broken kite, he lost the ability to fly and fell straight down, crashing firmly into the ground.

The crowd were all confused to see this scene.

That fellow was clearly extremely powerful and planning to take care of them earlier. Why would he suddenly fall so miserably to the ground?

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

At the moment when everyone was confused, many blood-colored pillars appeared out of thin air. Like sharp swords, the pillars shot down from the sky and pierced through that man’s body in succession, pinning him to the ground.

“Eeeahh~~~”

With his body pierced, that man with light revolving around his body started to scream in miserable pain.

At that moment, the crowd were finally able to tell who it was that had done all this.

It was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had appeared at the spirit formation entrance.

He had used the power of his treasures to easily restrict that fellow with the sacred light revolving around him.

Seeing that, the crowd all felt great admiration.

The power emitted by that man earlier had been so very powerful. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It had brought unease to even Tuoba Chengan.

Yet, he had been so easily subdued by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

At that moment, they seemed to finally realize why someone as conceited as Grandmaster Huang would show such esteem for Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was simply too powerful; terrifyingly powerful.

He simply resembled a freak, a monster.

“Bastard! You dare injure this Exalted?! My brothers will definitely not spare you!” that person pinned down by the blood-red pillars shouted angrily.

“This Exalted?”

“Mystic Cave Saints, don’t try to mystify things before this Exalted.”

“With your mere bit of ability, you dare address yourself as Exalted?” mocked the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

“Mystic Cave Saints?”

The crowd were all stunned upon hearing those words.

The people from the All-heaven Sect had all heard of the Mystic Cave Saints.

Could it be that the person lying on the ground, the person that had robbed them of their treasures, was one of the Mystic Cave Saints?

But, that shouldn’t be the case. The Mystic Cave Saints shouldn’t be that powerful.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, a horsetail whisk appeared in that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s hand.

That horsetail whisk was extremely strange. It was actually blood-colored.

“Woosh~~~”

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted suddenly waved the horsetail whisk.

Immediately, a blood-red gale was sent forth toward the man with light revolving around him.

“Eeahhh~~~”

Being hit by the blood-red gale, that man’s voice grew even more miserable.

After the blood-red gale swept past him, the crowd were able to see that the light revolving around his body had disappeared.

At this moment, a person wearing a gown was lying on the ground.

His outfit was precisely that of the Mystic Cave Saints.

This person was the Seventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“It’s actually the Mystic Cave Saints!”

“What audacity! You bunch dare to plunder the treasures of our All-heaven Sect?! Have you grown tired of living?!”

Upon realizing that they had indeed been robbed by the Mystic Cave Saints, the fear that the people from the All-heaven Sect felt immediately disappeared into thin air, and was replaced with endless anger.

After all, in their eyes, even though the Mystic Cave Saints were rather capable, they were nothing more than a bunch of low-tier scoundrels.

They believed the Mystic Cave Saints to be far inferior to Grandmaster Huang and that Grandmaster Ouyang who had fled earlier. Naturally, they would not attach any importance to them.

However, upon thinking that they were actually toyed around with by the Mystic Cave Saints earlier, the anger in their hearts naturally increased manifold.

At that moment, their eyes had turned blood-red, and their killing intent was surging everywhere.

They were itching to tear all the Mystic Cave Saints to pieces.

Even if they were to skin them alive, pull out their tendons and drink their blood, they would not be able to appease their anger.

“Don’t be in such a rush to take care of him.”

“There’s still ten more of these little rats.”

“It would not be too late for you all to take care of them once this Exalted captures all of them.”

After the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted said those words, he turned around and entered the spirit formation entrance again.

“Damn it!”

Seeing the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s confident look as he entered the spirit formation entrance, the Seventh of the Mystic Cave Saints disregarded his own injuries and pain. Worry filled his eyes.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was simply too terrifying.

He had clearly already obtained the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s acknowledgement, and gained great power both inside and outside the tomb.

Yet, he was completely powerless to retaliate against the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

This made him worry greatly for his brothers. He was afraid his brothers would all be captured by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

......

The Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb was extremely mysterious.

Even though the Mystic Cave Saints had obtained the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s acknowledge and gained special powers, there were still many places that they could not reach.

In fact, there were places that even the mysterious and extremely powerful Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted could not reach.

One such example would be a dusky palace hall.
