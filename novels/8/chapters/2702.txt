Chapter 2702 - Poisonous Beauty

“Why didn’t you say those words when he was here?” Chu Xianshou asked.

“I...” That Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation revealed an awkward expression.

“That’s because he would be able to completely obliterate all of us with a single point of his hand.”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that we’re people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, he would definitely not have left the matter at that,” Chu Xianshuo said.

“Then what should we do? Are we to spare that brat just like this?” Someone asked.

“Heh...” Chu Xianshuo chuckled. He said, “There are countless ants like him in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. If we want to eliminate him, no one will be able to protect him.”

“Remember, even if we’re in the Starfall Holy Land’s territory, no one will dare to do anything to us as long as we don’t kill him,” Chu Xianshuo said.

“Big brother Xianshuo is truly wise. We understand what to do now,” At that moment, those members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation all revealed smiles on their faces.

Chu Feng had been returned to that mountain peak’s summit.

Merely, the people below the mountain peak were already gone. Mist had covered the entire mountain peak. Thus, the people below were no longer able to see the situation at the top.

Chu Feng felt that it might be because of the fact that they were unable to see what was happening at the top of the mountain peak that they left.

Of course, it was also possible that the people from the Starfall Holy Land had sent them away.

Regardless, only the Starfall Eight Immortals, Chu Feng and Song Xi were on the top of the mountain peak at that moment.

Once again, that old man opened the entrance to the palace. He turned to Chu Feng and said, “Young master, please enter.”

Chu Feng was smiling faintly. He wanted to say ‘exactly what sort of game is your Holy Daughter playing?’

However, before he could speak, a gentle power pushed him into the palace. Then, the entrance behind him closed.

At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that the first level of the palace, that vast hall, was no longer completely empty.

A woman wearing a white skirt was standing at the corner of the palace hall and looking at Chu Feng.

That woman was very beautiful. However, there was a cruel, toying expression in her eyes.

“It’s you!” Chu Feng cried out in surprise. There was a great amount of displeasure in his tone.

The reason for that was because he recognized the woman. She was that exceptional beauty Chu Feng had encountered in the Sacred Mountain.

When he saw the woman, Chu Feng understood everything.

“That’s right, it’s me,” the woman still had a smile on her face. That smile was very sweet and charming.

“So you are the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun’er?” Chu Feng asked.

He had actually already managed to guess her identity. Merely, he wanted to verify it.

“Didn’t I say that you’ll know who I am? Look, you know who I am now, no? There is simply no need for me to introduce myself,” Xia Yun’er said to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.

Then, she asked, “Those people from the Chu Heavenly Clan didn’t do anything to you, right?”

“Aren’t you asking a question that you already know the answer to?” Chu Feng cast a cold side-eye at Xia Yun’er.

“Oh? You’re speaking as if it’s because of me that they did something to you,” Xia Yun’er said.

“No, it’s unrelated to you. I was merely too weak,” Chu Feng said.

“I actually don’t know how to respond when you put it that way,” Xia Yun’er smiled charmingly and shrugged her shoulders helplessly.

“Don’t beat around the bush anymore. Tell me, exactly what do you want from me?” Chu Feng said.

“What I want is very simple. I merely want you to know that you’ve arrived in my territory now.”

“Thus, how are you going to settle the debt of stealing my natural energies on the Sacred Mountain?” Xia Yun’er said.

“I’ve already told you that I will make up for it in the future,” Chu Feng said.

“How long into the future?” Xia Yun’er asked.

“Within two years,” Chu Feng said.

“How am I to trust you?” Xia Yun’er said.

“If you don’t trust me, you can kill me directly,” Chu Feng said.

“You are truly interesting.”

“Forget about it. Two years it is then. However, you don’t have to necessarily make it up to me with natural energies. It would be fine for you to give me treasures of equal value.”

“Of course, I am the one to decide what sort of treasures I want,” Xia Yun’er said.

“That’s fine. It’s settled then. If there’s nothing else, I will take my leave now,” Chu Feng turned around after saying those words. He planned to leave.

“You have come here for the Immortal Armament Villa’s hunt, right?” Xia Yun’er asked.

“What if I have and what if I haven’t?” Chu Feng replied in a very cold manner.

After what had happened, Chu Feng was able to ascertain that the so-called Holy Daughter Xia Yun’er was a poison-hearted woman.

She was extremely dangerous. Even though she was not planning to kill him at the moment, she might have some ulterior motive.

Thus, Chu Feng must be cautious of a woman like her.

“There is a special World Spirit Beast in the Immortal Armament Villa’s hunting ground this year. That World Spirit Beast contains a sufficient amount of World Spirit Bones to allow you to reach first place. It also contains a large amount of treasures.”

“It possesses a very distinctive characteristic. It is completely red in color, a hundred meters tall and a thousand meters long.”

“It is located at the Southeastern region of the hunting ground. After entering the hunting ground, you merely need to continue walking toward the Southeastern region and you’ll find it once you reach the deepest region.”

“However, that World Spirit Beast is very powerful. It would be very difficult to defeat it using brute force.”

“As for its weakness, it is the center of its brows. As long as you continue to aim at the center of its brows, you will be able to kill it,” Xia Yun’er said.

“Are you helping me?” Chu Feng asked.

“You can consider it me making up for my prank earlier,” Xia Yun’er said with a smile.

What Xia Yun’er meant by prank would naturally be her deliberately calling Chu Feng to meet her so that Chu Xianshuo and the others end up attacking him.

“If what you say is true, I will return to thank you,” Chu Feng said.

“Oh, that’s right. Be careful if you encounter Chu Xianshuo and the others again. Even though I’ve had Elder Xingyi warn them, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations have always been undisciplined and out of control. This is especially true for that Chu Xianshuo because he possesses a powerful background.”

“Thus, I also cannot guarantee whether or not they will try to attack you again,” Xia Yun’er said.

“You don’t have to worry about that,” Chu Feng said.

After he said those words, the palace hall’s exit opened. Then, Chu Feng walked out of the palace.

Right after Chu Feng walked out of the palace, he felt his surrounding turning fuzzy.

It was that old man, the person that Xia Yun’er called Elder Xingyi.

He was bringing Chu Feng and Song Xi with him while traveling in the sky. His speed was astonishingly fast.

“Our Holy Daughter possesses the temperament of a child. She does not have any malice in her actions. I hope that young master will not take things to heart,” Elder Xingyi said to Chu Feng.

“Regardless of how things happened, I must still thank senior for helping me today,” Chu Feng said.

“Haha, it was our Holy Daughter’s intention to have this old man help you,” Elder Xingyi said.

“This junior understands,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng knew very well that Elder Xingyi had only gone to help him because of Xia Yun’er’s orders.

However, regardless, it was thanks to his prompt arrival that he was prevented from having to kneel to Chu Xianshuo.

To Chu Feng, this was an enormous favor.

“Well then, below is the Immortal Armament Villa. This old man will only see you two off to here.”

“Young masters, the future is long, I hope that we will meet again,” Elder Xingyi clasped his fist at Chu Feng and Song Xi.

Chu Feng and Song Xi both clasped their fists back at Elder Xingyi.

Elder Xingyi once again clasped his fists at Chu Feng and Song Xi. Then, he turned around and left.

“Heavens! That is one of the Starfall Eight Immortals. Not only did he personally help me heal my injuries, but he even personally brought us to the Immortal Armament Villa. Furthermore, he’s been so courteous toward us the entire time.”

“This is something that I would never have even dreamed of happening in the past. Yet now... it actually happened.”

“Chu Feng, you are truly too amazing. It is all thanks to you that I managed to receive such treatment.”

Song Xi was extremely excited. The injury he received from Chu Xianshuo earlier had been completely healed.

“Properly train yourself. Nothing is impossible,” Chu Feng said.

“If it’s me, then forget about it. I know very well how talented I am.”

“If it’s reaching the True Immortal realm, I am confident in being able to do so. However, I do not even dare to think about the Heavenly Immortal realm, much less the Martial Immortal realm.”

Song Xi shook his head with a smile. Although Song Xi was smiling when he said those words, Chu Feng noticed disappointment in Song Xi’s eyes.

Song Xi was someone who put great effort into his martial cultivation. Chu Feng knew that he also hoped that he would be able to reach even higher levels of martial cultivation. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

It was not because Song Xi wanted to be revered and respected by others. Instead, it was purely because he wanted to reach a higher level in the path of martial cultivation.

“While it is true that one’s talent is very important on the path of martial cultivation, fortune and luck are even more important than talent.”

“I feel that you’ve yet to encounter your fortune and luck. However, sooner or later, you will definitely encounter them.”

“That said, don’t be discouraged. You must persist. Otherwise... the fortunate opportunity that belongs to you will never come,” Chu Feng encouraged Song Xi.

“Mn, I will definitely persist,” Song Xi laughed.

It would appear that Chu Feng had managed to successfully encourage him. At least, Chu Feng had provided him with confidence.

After that, Chu Feng and Song Xi flew down from the sky and arrived at the Immortal Armament Villa.

The Immortal Armament Villa was actually really a villa. Furthermore, all of its constructions were extremely simple and unadorned. It even looked a bit worn.

That said, the Immortal Armament Villa was very large. Furthermore, they treated their guests extremely well. Practically all those that arrived to participate in the hunt were given places to live.

Even the friends and family that they’d brought with them were enthusiastically received by the Immortal Armament Villa. They simply did not possess the arrogance of a major power at all. Chu Feng found this to be very satisfactory.

The reason for that was because very few powers in the world of martial cultivation would act like the Immortal Armament Villa.

This was even more so after he experienced how oppressive those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were. By comparison, the way the Immortal Armament Villa treated their guests was even more praiseworthy.
