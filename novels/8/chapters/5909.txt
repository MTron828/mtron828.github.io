Chapter 5910: Overpowered Bloodline Power

Chu Feng revealed his aura, allowing everyone else to sense his successful breakthrough.

“Can we set off now?” Wen Xue asked.

“I need a moment more. I’ll call you when we’re setting off.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Under the pretext of preparation, Chu Feng bade farewell to Wen Xue and the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster before bringing Zi Ling to his residence in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

The first thing he did was to construct a sealing formation around his residence, followed by a recovery formation, before taking out a couple of recovery pills.

“Big brother Chu Feng, what are you doing?” Zi Ling frowned in confusion.

“It’s nothing. I just want to try my means,” Chu Feng replied.

Lightning crackled in the room. He had simultaneously activated his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, raising his cultivation by three ranks to rank nine Half-God level.

However, his true strength was not just at rank nine Half-God level. Unbeknownst to others, he had a hidden heaven-defying battle power of one that was undetectable to others.

Back when he was at rank five Half-God level, after utilizing all of his bloodline powers and God Lightning Bestowment, he was able to fight toe to toe with a rank one True God level cultivator. This defied the common sense of martial cultivation, but he still pulled it off.

Chu Feng wanted to know what the limitation of his strength was now that his cultivation had risen to rank six Half-God level. Was his fighting prowess capped at rank one True God level, or would it go a step higher to rank two True God level?

Tzlala!

The lightning around Chu Feng suddenly changed. Eight colors of the nine-colored lightning receded, leaving behind just the red lightning. Yet, his Lightning Armor felt more domineering, and his Lightning Wings felt even greater than before. Even his eyes were filled with red lightning.

His disposition felt very different from before. He felt both like a god, as well as a demon.

Even though he only had the red lightning left, he felt even stronger than when he was with the nine-colored lightning. Even Zi Ling felt intimidated by his presence.

Chu Feng revealed an excited smile, for the outcome was what he had wished for.

“Big brother Chu Feng, what’s that?” Zi Ling couldn’t help but ask.

She felt like Chu Feng had undergone a metamorphosis, but his cultivation still looked to be rank nine Half-God level to her.

“Zi Ling, this is my strongest means at the moment. It shatters the restrictions of my cultivation. My base cultivation level is rank six Half-God. Unleashing the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings raise my cultivation to rank nine Half-God, but I have an additional hidden heaven-defying battle power that others can’t discern.

“This red lightning skill is known as God Lightning Bestowment, and it also grants me a hidden heaven-defying battle power. Under normal circumstances, I’d still be at Half-God level even if I gained an additional heaven-defying battle power of two. That would only give me an advantage when fighting against fellow Half-God level cultivators. Against a True God-level cultivator, my only options are to run or die.

“However, God Lightning Bestowment defies that common sense by shattering that restriction that limits me to Half-God level. Right now, I have the strength to rival rank two True God level cultivators. In fact, I’d say ordinary rank two True God level cultivators aren’t my match.”

Chu Feng explained the true prowess of his bloodline power.

He had confirmed that he was a match for rank two True God level cultivators, which was why he was so excited in the first place.

“It’s unheard of for a rank six Half-God to rival a rank two True God! Big brother Chu Feng, you’re getting more and more overpowered!” Zi Ling was not stingy with her compliments.

She had come a long way too, but Chu Feng’s means still astounded her.

“However, there’s a downside to this means,” Chu Feng said. He took the recovery pill in advance and settled down in the recovery formation. “I’ll become extremely weak after the effects of God Lightning Bestowment die down and even faint, but you don’t need to worry. I’ll wake up shortly after, and there is no lasting damage.”

With that, Chu Feng dispelled his bloodline power and other means, reverting his cultivation to its original level. The feeling of weakness immediately assaulted him, and he swiftly fainted.

However, he quickly woke up shortly after.

He had consumed the recovery pills and constructed the recovery formation in advance to deal with the side effects of God Lightning Bestowment. Thus, he wasn’t as weak as before when he woke up this time around.

However, Zi Ling still looked at Chu Feng nervously and asked, “Big brother Chu Feng, how are you feeling?”

“I’m fine. I’m just a little weakened,” Chu Feng replied.

“Just a little weakened?” Zi Ling was skeptical.

Great power often came at a great price, such as in the case of forbidden medicine. Chu Feng’s bloodline power exceeded the means of any forbidden medicine, so its danger should have been correspondingly great as well.

“Yes, that’s all. You can take a look if you doubt me,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

Zi Ling quickly inspected his body and found that he was indeed just weakened. She remarked in awe,” Big brother Chu Feng, your bloodline power is ridiculously powerful.”

She found it unbelievable how such a powerful means only required a disproportionately minor price. “Is this your awakened Heavenly Lightning Bloodline?”

“Not entirely so. This is indeed a means bestowed to me by my Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, but I’m not sure if others can grasp it,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Will your fighting prowess continue to rise when your cultivation advances to rank seven Half-God level?” Zi Ling asked out of curiosity.

“I’m not sure about that. I’d have to first reach rank seven Half-God level to know,” Chu Feng replied.

At this point, he turned to the golden mark morphed by the Heaven-devouring Qilin. The latter had claimed to be able to raise his cultivation level after assimilating the dragon essence, but he ended up sleeping till now.

“Say, Qilin, are you sleeping or just faking it? If you’re faking it, I’ll forgive you if you get out right now and raise my cultivation.”

“Big brother Chu Feng, who are you talking to?” Zi Ling asked out of curiosity.

“It is a pet I’m raising. You’ll see him in the future,” Chu Feng pointed to the golden mark on his chest as he said.

Zi Ling closely observed the golden mark. “What kind of pet is it? A pig?”

“You can say so,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.
