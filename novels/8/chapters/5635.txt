A person suddenly appeared in the sky. It was the saint-tier elder who had previously stood up for him, Elder Zhenfu.

“Congratulations for coming this far, but it’s not easy to join our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. You’ll be undergoing three trials, and you’ll have to clear them to qualify for the combat exam. The participants of the combat exam will be ranked according to their results, and only those in the top ten will be welcomed in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Their descendants will also be automatically considered to be one of our own.

“The champion of the combat exam will be bestowed with the title of the Sacred Mansion’s Rising Star, and they will be entitled to a Saint-tier treasure,” Elder Zhenfu said.

Those words stirred a huge commotion.

There were only ten slots even though there were tens of millions of junior world spiritists gathered in this space, and this was after a large number of people had been eliminated in the prior trial.

The ten people would truly have to be the cream of the crop, the prodigies amongst the prodigies. However, no one voiced their complaints, as they knew from the start that it would be no easy feat to enter the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

As a matter of fact, most of the participants didn’t harbor any hope about it. They simply wanted to be part of his momentous event, thinking that it would be interesting to see how far they could get and that they could brag about this in the future.

“You may begin,” Elder Zhenfu said as the three spirit formation gates opened.

All of the prodigious world spiritists randomly rushed into one of the three spirit formation gates, knowing that it didn’t matter which one they started with since they had to clear all three in order to qualify for the combat exam.

Chu Feng’s first choice was the psyche trial.

Upon passing through the spirit formation gate, he found himself inside a formation palace. Everything in this formation palace was made out of spirit power. It was beautiful, but it wasn’t too big.

He scanned his surroundings, but there was no one around. This suggested that everyone who walked through the ‘Psyche’ spirit formation gate would enter an independent formation palace.

At the other end of the formation palace was an open spirit formation gate, which was likely to be the exit. At the center of the palace was a pillar manifested out of spirit power with a stream of light flowing within it, making it look holy and beautiful.

What drew Chu Feng’s attention were the six words inscribed on the top of the pillar: Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Jie Ranqing.

His heart jolted upon seeing those words. Those words were inscribed with a gentle and beautiful calligraphy typical of a woman, which contrasted with the imposing calligraphy outside. Without a doubt, these inscriptions were from his mother.

Chu Feng rose into the air and touched those inscriptions. He could feel a lump in his throat. Through his sharp senses as a world spiritist, he could sense a lingering aura in the inscriptions. These were indeed his mother’s words.

…

In a palace located in the heart of Spring Upper Realm, there was a formation reminiscent of a lake. Two figures floated above the lake. One of them was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, and the other one was someone with a height of only 1.3 meters.

The latter emanated a brilliant light that obscured their appearance, making it hard to discern whether they were a man or a woman. However, their constitution made them look like a child.

Countless bubbles rose from the lake formation. Each of these bubbles reflected what was happening inside the trials.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had his eyes locked on Chu Feng’s bubble. Through the bubble, he could see everything Chu Feng did in the formation palace. When other bubbles blocked his line of sight, he would use his spirit power to shift them away.

“Why do you bear such high hopes for that child? What’s his background?” the short person emanating a brilliant light spoke with a hoarse, elderly voice.

“Milord, that person is Chu Feng. In my view, he’s the most likely person to become the champion of the entrance examination,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master spoke with a respectful voice.

“What do you think his result for that test would be?” the elder asked.

“Based on his past performance, I believe that he could manifest the Immortal Dragon Mark’s silhouette in the psyche trial,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Heh…” The elder chuckled teasingly. “Tianran, it looks like you really have high hopes for him.”

“Milord, I used to think that there can be no junior world spiritist as talented as those in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but that child has achieved feats surpassing my expectations. His talent is the real deal,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Some words of reminder, Tianran. Don’t expect too much out of those outsiders. You’ll only be disappointed,” the elder said.

Weng!

Chu Feng’s formation palace suddenly emanated a brilliant light. He had started fusing his psyche into the pillar, thus commencing the test. Dragon silhouettes started rushing out of the pillar.

White Dragon Mark…

Gray Dragon Mark…

Blue Dragon Mark…

Purple Dragon Mark…

Gold Dragon Mark…

Royal Dragon Mark…

Immortal Dragon Mark…

Seven different dragon silhouettes surged out of the pillar and coiled within the palace.

“Hoh, he really triggered the Immortal Dragon Mark’s silhouette in the trial. Tianran, you have a good eye for people,” the elder remarked, though his tone remained arrogant.

Grar!

Another dragon’s howl echoed, as the Exalted Dragon Mark’s silhouette surged out of the pillar. By now, there were eight dragon silhouettes coiling in the formation palace.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was taken aback. The elder also fell silent, as he focused his gaze on Chu Feng.

Grar!

Another dragon’s roar echoed.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master clenched his fists, as nervousness seeped in his eyes. However, the trial concluded before the Saint Dragon Mark’s silhouette appeared.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master heaved a sigh of relief.

“Tianran, you can’t really be worried about it, are you?” the elder asked with a smile.

“Milord, you should also know that my unfilial daughter has been the only one to trigger the Saint Dragon Mark’s silhouette since my master constructed this formation. While Chu Feng is talented, he ultimately isn’t nurtured by our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It wouldn’t reflect well on us if he obtains the mark,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Hahaha…” The elder burst into laughter. “Tianran, I know what you’re worried about, but your worry is unfounded. I don’t know what has gone wrong with the formation that nearly allowed that lad to trigger the Saint Dragon Mark’s silhouette, but you shouldn’t forget that one has to trigger the Saint Dragon Mark’s silhouette in all three of the trials in order to obtain your master’s mark. He won’t be so lucky as to trigger all three Saint Dragon Mark’s silhouettes and obtain the mark,” the elder said confidently.

“You’re right, milord,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master agreed.

Little did they know that Chu Feng could have triggered the Saint Dragon Mark’s silhouette if he wanted to, but he gave up because he didn’t want to break his mother’s record and remove her name. He knew that someone could outdo his mother in the future, but he didn’t want to be the one to do so.

There were hardly any traces of his mother around, so how could he bear to remove her mark?
