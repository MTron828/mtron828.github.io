Chapter 3140 - Never Before Seen

Chu Feng was originally being ravaged by that monster. Even though he was already unconscious, his soul was still enduring unbearable pain.

However, suddenly, the pain began to subside. It was as if that monster had stopped its torture.

This change had puzzled Chu Feng.

That said, what confused Chu Feng even more was that....

...not long afterward, a very gentle force began to fill his body.

It was natural energies. Furthermore, those were no ordinary natural energies. The natural energies entering Chu Feng were extremely gentle, and were capable of fusing with Chu Feng’s body perfectly. Furthermore, the natural energies contained worldly profoundness and martial comprehension.

As long as Chu Feng could comprehend it, he would be able to gain martial comprehension and break through the martial cultivation barriers in his path.

This sort of change greatly shocked Chu Feng. Even though Chu Feng did not know the reason why such a change was happening in his body, Chu Feng began to comprehend the power flowing into his body.

The reason for that was because this power was very easy to comprehend to begin with. Furthermore, with Chu Feng’s comprehension ability, he soon managed to comprehend the profoundness within it.

Chu Feng even felt that with the martial comprehension that he had already comprehended and the natural energies that he had already gathered, as well as the power of his bloodline, it would not be difficult for him to make a breakthrough to even rank eight Heavenly Immortal.

However, he was clearly being tortured by a monster. Why would he suddenly gain so much martial comprehension and natural energy?

Chu Feng was very confused and surprised. In fact, he was even suspecting all of this to be a dream.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng was startled awake. He discovered that he was lying on the cave floor.

Even though the fog had dissipated, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that it was the place where he was defeated by the monsters.

But... where were the monsters?

Where was that little girl?

Moreover, that Immortal Crystal Ore had also disappeared.

Chu Feng began to inspect the martial comprehension in his head, and discovered that they really existed in his head.

Furthermore, if Chu Feng wanted to, he could immediately attempt a breakthrough. In fact, Chu Feng was even confident in being able to successfully make a breakthrough. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This caused Chu Feng to become overjoyed.

All of this was not a dream.

Overwhelmed with excitement, Chu Feng actually shouted “This is actually real, actually real!!!”

“Chu Feng, you’re awake? How are you feeling? Are you alright?”

Right at that moment, Her Lady Queen’s gentle and beautiful voice was heard.

Her Lady Queen’s tone was filled with concern for Chu Feng’s well-being.

“Eggy, I am fine. Not only that, but something good has happened,” Chu Feng was wild with joy. Contained within his voice was unconcealable joy.

“Something good? What is it?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“Eggy... could it be that you do not know what happened earlier?” Chu Feng asked.

“What happened earlier?”

“Have you forgotten what happened earlier?”

“Weren’t you tortured to a state of losing consciousness by that monster earlier?”

Her Lady Queen had a confused expression on her face. She was confused by Chu Feng’s words.

Her Lady Queen was capable of sharing Chu Feng’s vision and hearing. However, when Chu Feng lost consciousness and was having his soul attacked by the monster earlier, Her Lady Queen was unable to see or hear anything at all.

Thus, even though Her Lady Queen was still awake when Chu Feng was unconscious, she actually had no clue as to what had happened earlier.

All she knew was what Chu Feng knew.

“Eggy, something’s amiss,” Chu Feng said.

“What’s amiss?” Her Lady Queen asked.

Chu Feng began to inform Her Lady Queen about what had happened to him.

“There’s such a good thing?” Hearing Chu Feng’s story, Her Lady Queen revealed a joyous expression. That said, her beautiful eyes were also flickering nonstop. She seemed to be pondering the cause of all this.

“Could it be that little girl?” Her Lady Queen said.

Once Her Lady Queen said those words, Chu Feng suddenly recalled that the little girl had disappeared, and the Immortal Crystal Ore had disappeared with her. Indeed, all of this seemed to be related to her.

“Eggy, you’re saying that it was that little girl that saved me?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s hard to say. However, I feel that the power that you’ve obtained must be related to that Immortal Crystal Ore.”

“Thus, while I do not know if it’s that little girl that saved you, she must’ve given you a portion of the Immortal Crystal Ore’s power. That was the cause of the change that you’re currently experiencing,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Eggy, what you said is very true. It would appear that what you’ve said is most likely the case. Never would i have expected that I’d end up enjoying that little girl’s good fortune.”

At that moment, Chu Feng was practically certain that the power he had obtained was given to him by the little girl.

With how powerful that little girl was, the people behind her should be even more powerful.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that it might be possible that the person that had saved him and that little girl might be someone related to that little girl.

Afterwards, that little girl fulfilled her promise to him, and forcibly imbued a portion of the Immortal Crystal Ore’s power into him.

“You can consider it that your virtuous behavior had been rewarded. After all, if it wasn’t for you stepping in to help, that little girl would not have been able to escape either,” Her Lady Queen said.

“But I failed to bring her out of the fog safely. In fact, I was saved because of her. We were merely strangers, yet she was willing to share such cultivation resources with me. In the future, if an opportunity presents itself, I will definitely repay her.”

“That said, right now, I must quickly find big sis Shuangshuang.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he immediately set off, and began flying toward the direction he had come from.

When Chu Feng mentioned Chu Shuangshuang, intense worry flashed through his eyes.

After all, Chu Feng had learned from the little girl that Chu Shuangshuang had been captured by people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.

The most crucial aspect regarding this was that Chu Shuangshuang was in great danger now that she had been captured by the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.

“No, Chu Feng. I know that you are extremely worried about Chu Shuangshuang, but there is one thing that I must remind you of. If you are able to find her now, and find out that she has only been captured by ordinary Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen, you can attempt to save her.”

“However, if she is captured by experts from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, or that expert they hired, what are you to do?”

“Thus, I think that you should attempt to make a breakthrough first. If you are able to increase your cultivation, you will have greater certainty in being able to rescue Chu Shuangshuang,” Her Lady Queen said.

Chu Feng felt what Her Lady Queen said to be reasonable too.

After all, Chu Feng was still unclear as to what the cultivation of the strongest individual among the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen was. He also did not know the cultivation of the expert the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan had requested help from.

“Very well, I will listen to you Eggy.”

Although Chu Feng had decided to make a breakthrough in cultivation, he did not attempt to do so immediately. Instead, he sought out a remote location and spent great effort in setting up a concealing formation.

Although the cave was enormous and resembled a world in itself, Chu Feng knew that the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan were searching for the Immortal Crystal Ore within the cave.

Thus, Chu Feng needed to conceal himself. Otherwise, if he was discovered by the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen during a crucial moment in his breakthrough, it would definitely be disastrous.

Meanwhile, while Chu Feng was attempting to make a breakthrough. In the Chu Heavenly Clan’s southwestern region.

That place was a continuous mountain range. Deep in the mountain range were Chu Hongyi and the others.

At that moment, they all had satisfied expressions on their faces.

“Big brother Hongyi, this is all thanks to you.”

The crowd were all expressing their thanks to Chu Hongyi. The reason for that was because they had successfully discovered an Immortal River there. Although the Immortal River would only last for a short period of time, they had gained bountifully from it.

“There’s no need for the modesty. We are all brothers of the same family,” Chu Hongyi said with a smile.

“Big brother Hongyi treated us so very well. Yet, those guys that just came actually did not believe in big brother Hongyi. It’s truly irritating.”

“What’s there to be irritated about? To refuse to trust big brother Hongyi is their own loss. Take this time as an example. If they had followed us, they would’ve been able to train in the Immortal River. Right now... I bet they’re regretting it enormously.”

“Don’t say it like that. Didn’t that Chu Feng say that he would be able to find an undercurrent of the Immortal River? Perhaps they’re training inside the undercurrent right now.”

“Merely with that brat? Who did he think he was? If he could find an undercurrent of the Immortal River, I will eat feces.”

“If you say it like that, I will think that there’s no chance of that happening. After all, that brat might not be able to find it.”

“Hahaha...”

The crowd were all mocking and ridiculing Chu Feng for the sake of currying favor with Chu Hongyi.

Hearing the crowd’s words, Chu Hongyi revealed a pleased smile.

This was precisely the result that he wanted. He wanted everyone to acknowledge allegiance to him and despise Chu Feng.

“It’s enough. They’re nothing more than a couple of clowns. However, brothers and sisters, seeing that they’re our fellow clansmen, we should not lower ourselves to their level,” Chu Hongyi said.

“Big brother Hongyi is truly magnanimous.”

“That’s right. In the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, only big brother Hongyi is capable of being our leader.”

The crowd continued to flatter Chu Hongyi nonstop. They were all expressing their desire to follow him.

Seeing the crowd like that, the smile on Chu Hongyi’s face grew even denser.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, thunder exploded in the sky.

As they looked in the direction of the thunder, the expressions of the crowd present all changed. Shock appeared in their eyes.

They discovered that lightning was gathering high in the sky.

The lightning resembled giant dragons and ferocious beasts. It was so very mighty that it was simply something that they had never before seen or heard of.
