Chapter 3693 - The Killer’s Weakness

“Is your father really not here anymore?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

“Senior, I feel that my father has not died,” Chu Feng said what he truly felt.

Chu Feng felt that he did not have to conceal anything from her.

“I got it then.”

Gu Mingyuan did not ask anything more after hearing those words. However, she revealed a smile of relief on her face.

Chu Feng was able to tell that Gu Mingyuan might not know his father very well. However, their relationship should be pretty decent.

At least, she was worried about his father’s well-being.

Then, together with Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan, Chu Feng arrived at the place where the Blood-devouring Hall’s members were being interrogated.

When they arrived at the interrogation site, they discovered that Chu Xuanzhengfa and the experts of the Law Enforcement Hall, the experts of interrogation, were actually at their wits’ end.

Interrogation was nothing more than torturing someone to force them to reveal what one wanted to know.

Although the nine experts from the Blood-devouring Hall were all very powerful, they were chained by Gu Mingyuan’s special chains. Thus, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others’ interrogation methods were useful against them.

Unfortunately, although the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master and eight experts were all evildoers, they were extremely tough and unyielding.

No matter what sort of methods Chu Xuanzhengfa used, they were unwilling to utter a word.

Seeing this, it appeared that they would be unwilling to speak of who the mastermind was even in death.

“Chu Feng, Lingxi, what brought you two here?”

Chu Xuanzhengfa was rather surprised to see Chu Feng and the others.

Evidently, he did not wish for Chu Feng, Chu Lingxi and especially Gu Mingyuan to see his powerless appearance.

However, Gu Mingyuan did not care about what Chu Xuanzhengfa was thinking. She directly entered the interrogation site and waved her hand. “All of you can leave.”

Her tone was as ice-cold as before. She looked like a completely different person than when she was talking with Chu Feng.

When she was talking with Chu Feng, she was like an amiable and gentle senior.

However, she now appeared extremely arrogant and cold, like a ruthless queen.

Although she was not from the Chu Heavenly Clan, not even Chu Xuanzhengfa dared to neglect her. As for the others, it was even more so.

Thus, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not even bother to ask anything, and directly led all of the people from the Law Enforcement Hall out of the interrogation site.

He handed over the hall that they used for interrogation to Gu Mingyuan.

With this, apart from the imprisoned experts of the Blood-devouring Hall, only Chu Feng, Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan remained in the dark and moist interrogation hall.

“Never would I have imagined that you scum would actually possess occupational professionalism.”

“Your mouths are quite tightly sealed,” Gu Mingyuan spoke with an extremely mocking tone.

“Heh, what sort of torture are you planning to use on this old man?” the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master asked.

“Torture? It’s extremely boring to torture you,” said Gu Mingyuan.

“If you want to torture them, this old man would not care in the slightest,” said the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I naturally knew that you would not care if I tortured them. However, what if I am to torture your grandson?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

“Grandson? That’s but a rumor. You actually believe in such a rumor?”

“I might as well tell you the truth. It is this old man who spread that rumor. I did that precisely because I wanted to baffle scum like you.”

“This old man doesn’t even have a son, how could I have a grandson?”

The Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master laughed and shook his head. He had an extremely mocking look on his face.

It was as if Gu Mingyuan mentioning his grandson was truly ridiculous.

“If that were truly a rumor that you spread out to baffle others, wouldn’t it be even better that you managed to deceive me with it? Why bother explaining it to me here?” said Gu Mingyuan.

“Truth be told, since I’ve fallen in your hands, I’ve never thought about being able to live. Because of that, I didn’t want you to waste your time.”

“Gu Mingyuan, you can be considered to be a top individual in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. To be able to die by your hands, my death is worth it.”

“How about you allow this old man a delightful death?” asked the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

“You wish to die? That’s fine.”

“Tell me who it was that ordered you to attack the Chu Heavenly Clan,” said Gu Mingyuan.

“I wasn’t ordered by anyone. This old man has a personal grievance against Chu Xuanyuan,” said the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

“Do you think that I’m easily deceived?”

“Let me tell you this. It’s fine that you wish to die.”

“However, you will only be allowed to die after you reveal who the mastermind is.”

“Before that, you will not be allowed to die. Just you wait, I’ll go and personally bring over that grandson of yours,” said Gu Mingyuan.

“Hahaha. Never would I have imagined Gu MIngyuan to be this foolish. You’re actually going to waste your time on a mere rumor?”

“Since you want to waste your time, go ahead and do that.”

The Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master burst into loud laughter. His laughter was filled with mockery.

“Hahaha...” However, right at that moment, Gu Mingyuan also burst into sudden laughter. Her laughter was even louder than the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s laughter.

“Stay alive. Don’t think about killing yourself. If you die on me, I guarantee that your grandson will suffer more than you.”

“Chu Feng, Lingxi, let’s go.” After saying those words, Gu Mingyuan left with Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi.

Although Chu Feng was no longer looking at the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master, he, with his world spirit techniques, was able to see his expression even with his back to him.

A trace of panic flashed past the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s face.

Seeing that, Chu Feng concluded that what Gu Mingyuan said might be true. The Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master might really have a grandson.

As for that grandson, it was clearly the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s weakness.

Even though he had tried his hardest to conceal it, it was still discovered by Chu Feng.
