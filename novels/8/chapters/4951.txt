Chapter 4951: Say

The pressure swiftly filled the floating palace.&nbsp;

The palace was a treasure that felt indestructible, but it was shaking nonstop as if it would shatter anytime now. It was not because it was weak but that Chu Feng’s world spiritist bloodline was simply too powerful.

“How could there be such a powerful world spiritist bloodline in the world?”

The crowd was shocked.

“Chu Feng, is this your world spiritist bloodline? I didn’t know you were this formidable.”

Yu Sha’s sweet voice was quivering a little as she said those words. Even she was shocked by Chu Feng’s world spiritist bloodline.

Those outside could only feel the pressure from his world spiritist bloodline through the aura, but only those inside the palace could sense just how terrifying it truly was.&nbsp;

Situ Gouyue was utterly dumbstruck.

He was still feeling indignant over his loss, but at this point, he was already fully cognizant of the gap between him and Chu Feng. It was as huge as the distance between heaven and earth!

To be honest, Chu Feng himself was astonished too.

“This is the world spiritist bloodline I’ve inherited from my mother?”

Chu Feng could sense that his world spiritist bloodline was like a trapped beast that was trying to break out of its confinement, and it delighted him. It was so powerful that he couldn’t gauge what kind of level it was at. He felt invincible!

To make a comparison, the feeling he was getting from his world spiritist bloodline wouldn’t be any weaker than the nine-colored lightning in his body at all. It was an indomitable existence!

Chu Feng had known all along that his world spiritist bloodline was incredibly powerful, but he had never thought that it would be to such an extent.

Pah!

Pah!

Pah!

Clapping could be heard outside the palace. It was from the blue-cloaked woman.

“Chu Feng, you have indeed not disappointed me. Your world spiritist bloodline is truly incredible. Even though there’s no guarantee that you’ll match up to your future potential, I must say that I do admire your talent greatly. You’re qualified to join our Situ World Spiritist Clan.

“I’ll allow you to become my disciple. In days to come, you’ll become the true overlord of the eastern region, second to none,” the blue-cloaked woman said.&nbsp;

Her words sounded pretty, but her tone was forceful. Rather than an invitation, it sounded like an order.&nbsp;

“Become your disciple?”&nbsp;

Chu Feng looked at the blue-cloaked woman with eyes filled with scorn.

“Reluctant?”

The blue-cloaked woman narrowed her eyes sharply, making it clear that there was no ground for negotiation here.&nbsp;

Chu Feng understood the meaning behind the blue-cloaked woman’s attitude, but he simply laughed it off.&nbsp;

“Do you think that you’re qualified to have me as your disciple?” Chu Feng asked.

Boom!

Those words shocked everyone.

The crowd did imagine the possibility that Chu Feng might reject the blue-cloaked woman’s offer, but they didn’t think that he would do it in such a manner. That was as good as courting death!

The blue-cloaked woman didn’t lose her temper at Chu Feng’s rejection. Instead, she smiled to herself.&nbsp;

Weng!

With a wave of her hand, a layer of spirit power appeared in the palace and enveloped Situ Gouyue. The next moment, Situ Gouyue was vanished from the palace, only to appear by her side. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Chu Feng noticed the seals formed by the blue-cloaked woman’s hand and knew that it was her doing. The palace was her treasure, so she had to know how to tap into its powers and bring those inside it out.&nbsp;

“I don’t think that you have fully understood what I’m saying. For your sake, I’ll make things clearer. You and those from the Zhuge Clan deserve death, but in view of the outstanding talent you have displayed, I’m willing to spare your life. You can choose to join our Situ World Spiritist Clan and serve us like a dog, or else you can die here!

“Think it carefully and make our choice.”

The blue-cloaked woman looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with murderous intent. Those words were supposed to be threats directed toward Chu Feng, but the Zhuge Clan could no longer keep their calm after hearing those words.&nbsp;

It turned out that the blue-cloaked woman had never intended to let them off. They felt like executioner’s blades were floating above each and every one of their necks, waiting for the blue-cloaked woman’s command to fall and lop off their heads.&nbsp;

“Lord Clan Chief…”

The crowd from the Zhuge Clan turned to look at the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, but the latter told them not to panic with a wave of his hand.&nbsp;

There was a slight change in his attitude, hinting that he had already come to a decision.&nbsp;

“I knew that it would turn out like this.”

Chu Feng wasn’t surprised by the blue-cloaked woman’s change in attitude. He dared to reject the blue-cloaked woman with such rude words because he knew that there was no turning back from the moment he stepped out to challenge Situ Gouyue.&nbsp;

Even if he agreed to become a dog of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, there was no guarantee that the latter would really let him off. Since his paths were already sealed off, he might as well stand his ground and fight.&nbsp;

There might just be a sliver of hope that way.&nbsp;

“What arrogant words. Did you think that you can govern my fate?”&nbsp;

Chu Feng looked at the blue-cloaked woman with provocative eyes.&nbsp;

“Hahaha! You must be thinking that I can’t do anything to you as long as you hide inside that palace. Have you forgotten that it’s my treasure?”

The blue-cloaked woman formed a series of hand seals, and a spirit power swiftly manifested inside the palace. This time, it appeared around Chu Feng’s vicinity.

This spirit power wielded the power of teleportation. If it successfully wrapped around Chu Feng, he would be brought to the blue-cloaked woman’s side, just like Situ Gouyue.

There was nothing for Chu Feng to fear within the palace since he had his indomitable bloodline power to back him up. However, outside of the palace, his bloodline power would lose its potency. He’ll be helpless before all of the much more powerful experts outside.

However, the spirit power quivered upon approaching Chu Feng.

Pah!

It dissipated.

It was Chu Feng’s bloodline power. He had forcefully dispelled the spirit power with the sheer prowess of his bloodline power.

“Hm?”

The blue-cloaked woman frowned, not expecting such an outcome.

On the other hand, Chu Feng remained perfectly calm. He sensed that he had gained the recognition of the palace the moment he released his bloodline power. With the sheer power of his bloodline power, he was able to breach the rules of the treasure and even govern it.

As much as the palace was the blue-cloaked woman’s treasure, it was also Chu Feng’s protective umbrella now.&nbsp;

He wielded great say here, and that was why he didn’t fear the blue-cloaked woman’s threat.
