Chapter 5842: Settling the Scores

Chapter 5842: Settling the Scores

Chu Feng looked at the 24 items. He took out three of the items he had previously stowed away and placed them back before picking three of the talismans. These talismans contained different formations—a body reinforcement formation, a speed enhancement formation, and a powerful concealment formation.

“Elder, why are you helping me?” Chu Feng asked the guild leader.

“Settle the problem first. We’ll chat later,” the guild leader replied.

“Thank you, elder.”

Chu Feng crushed the three talismans and fused it into him before leaping off the floating warship. He flitted across space as he made his way toward the black light pillar. With the enhancement of his formations, he was able to travel at a speed comparable to Divine Flitting.

As he traveled, he quickly constructed a formation.

“Elder, lend me your cultivation,” Chu Feng told the Asura King.

He only had one more use of the Asura World Spirit Army. After this, the Asura World Spirit Army would be sealed off, and he would have to unseal it once more.

Chu Feng felt that this battle would likely drag on for quite a bit. He could use his bloodline ability to attain power comparable to a rank one True God level cultivator too, but he would suffer a backlash afterward. No matter how he looked at it, it would be safer for him to rely on the Asura King’s power first.

“All right.” The Asura King answered Chu Feng’s request and imbued his power onto him.

By the time Chu Feng finished constructing his formation, he had already arrived before the black light pillar. This black light pillar was extremely powerful, capable of even breaching the powerful protective barrier to open a path into the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. However, there was a downside to the formation—it focused on offense and nothing else.

Chu Feng was able to slip into the black light pillar by fusing the formation he had created into it, and there was no risk of him being noticed too.

He had already planned things out, which was why he chose those three talismans—speed enhancement, concealment, and body reinforcement.

Body reinforcement formations were different from protective formations in the sense that they strengthened one’s constitution. Chu Feng had noticed that while the black light pillar was fast it was incomplete. Traveling through it would result in strong side effects. The body reinforcement formation served to minimize the side effects as far as possible

Meanwhile, Zi Ling was fighting with Zhao Gongyi and the other five prodigies. She had weakened five of them, but the blood-red chain’s failure to bind Zhao Gongyi meant that he could still exert his full strength, making him the most troublesome opponent at the moment.

She wouldn’t have had a problem dealing with him under normal circumstances, but the injuries hindered her from exerting full strength and fighting for a prolonged period of time.

She emerged from a clash and dodged another formation attack. However, she couldn’t suppress her old injuries and ended up spewing blood. She was forced to slow down and condition her state.

“Halt!” Zhao Gongyi raised his hand and told the others to stop their attacks.

The others were confused, but they did as they were told. They were aware that Zhao Gongyi was their main fighting force right now.

Zhao Gongyi looked at Zi Ling with a licentious smile, “Young miss, you have some means. I didn’t expect to meet someone as talented as you at a backward place like this. Your talent is buried here. I can also tell that your face is natural; you have never altered it in any way. I like natural beauties like you. Be mine, and I’ll spare you.”

Oblivious to the truth, he thought that Zi Ling had spat blood due to the shockwave of his attack.

Zi Ling could tell that he was making light of her, and that made her seeth with killing intent.

Boom!

A loud explosion suddenly echoed.

“Someone else is here?”

As the sound had come from the black light pillar, their first thought was that someone else was here. However, Zhao Gongyi and the others couldn’t fathom who it was. All of the juniors from their six Ancient Era’s clans had entered the formation core; there shouldn’t have been anyone else.

With confused eyes, they turned toward the black light pillar, and a person soon emerged.

It was Chu Feng.

“Big brother Chu Feng!”

As Chu Feng had taken off his cloak, Zi Ling was able to recognize him right away. Overjoyed, she immediately rushed over to his side despite knowing that this was a life-and-death battle.

“Who’s that?” Zhao Gongyi asked.

“Chu Feng, that Chu Feng. The one who defeated Huangfu Shengyu in the Nine Heavens Zenith.” The woman from the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan recognized Chu Feng.

“It really is him! Why did he come out from our formation?”

This was their first time meeting Chu Feng, but the happenings of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith had already spread far and wide, along with Chu Feng’s portrait.

“The rumors are true. I can rely on you again, big brother Chu Feng,” Zi Ling said with a smile.

Her appearance was the same, but the demeanor had completely changed from before. If she was a murderous war goddess a moment ago, she had transformed into a virtuous woman who had found her harbor.

However, Chu Feng couldn’t bring himself to smile. He wiped off the blood trail from Zi Ling’s lips with a heavy heart.

“Chu Feng? The one who’s said to have defeated Huangfu Shengyu?” Zhao Gongyi asked.

He didn’t believe that Chu Feng could have really defeated Huangfu Shengyu.

“Don’t underestimate your enemy, Zhao Gongyi. It’s not a rumor. That person is extremely powerful,” the woman from the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan reminded.

“Impossible. It has to be a rumor. How could a present-era cultivator possibly defeat Huangfu Shengyu?” Zhao Gongyi insisted. He turned to Chu Feng and said in contempt, “I’d have never thought she had a lover. It’s no wonder she doesn’t want to be mine. However, I don’t blame her. It shows that she’s devoted. It only makes me want her more.”

Zhao Gongyi then turned to Zi Ling. “Young miss, even animals choose their wood to rest on. I’ll kill your lover in front of you today so that you’ll know... Uwa!”

Zhao Gongyi collapsed on the floor before he could finish his words. Fresh blood spurted from his mouth, as he felt all of his bones shattering. He couldn’t even move. The same happened to the other five prodigies too.

Chu Feng had exerted his oppressive might!

“How could this be...” Zhao Gongyi trembled not due to his injuries but out of fear.

It was only now that he realized the rumor was true. Chu Feng did possess strength comparable to a True God level cultivator. Huangfu Shengyu wouldn’t have been a match for him.

But as much as he felt fear, he couldn’t accept the situation too. How could there be such a terrifying existence among the present-era cultivator?

Ta!

Ta!

Ta!

While he was struggling to make sense of the situation, Chu Feng walked up to Zhao Gongyi and pulled him up by his hair to assess his face. He recognized Zhao Gongyi’s voice to be the sucker he had screwed over in the auction that day.

“D-don’t kill me!” Zhao Gongyi’s eyes flickered. He dared not to face Chu Feng.

“You spoke so arrogantly. I wouldn’t think you feared death.” Chu Feng altered his voice to the one he had used in the auction hall that day.

Zhao Gongyi’s eyes widened, and he stared at Chu Feng in disbelief. “You...”

How could he forget the man who had screwed him over? He was so angry that he couldn’t sleep for days. Each time, he would dream about how he had gotten screwed over and woke up in a fit of anger.

“That’s right, it’s me. There’s no one to stop us now that we’re out of the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild. Let’s settle our scores,” Chu Feng said.

“W-w-wait! I’m sorry. I was ignorant. I got ahead of myself. Please spare me! I’m begging you, please spare me! Besides, I didn’t do anything to you. You were the one who screwed me over! I also didn’t lay a finger on that young miss either. I admit my words weren’t pretty, but you have already beaten me up over it. There’s no grudge between us anymore. Let me off, all right?”

Zhao Gongyi’s tears and snot flowed down his face, as his body trembled in fear. There was even a soft pattering sound that was coming not just from his face but his crotch.

The other five prodigies, despite their severe injuries, opened their mouths in shock. They had never expected the arrogant Zhao Gongyi to fear death so much as to pee his pants. Even they had more spunk than that!
