MGA: Chapter 1741 - A Mountain Of Corpses, A Sea Of Blood

“How would we know whether or not you are making this sort of thing up?” The Beitang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“I would not deceive you two in something as serious as this. That Chu Feng’s Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings are capable of increasing his cultivation by two levels. The abnormal sign caused by Chu Feng was also formed by lightning.”

“Furthermore, you all have seen with your own eyes how heaven-defying that child’s talent is. The speed at which his cultivation increases is simply unimaginable. How could you all still not understand what he is with that sort of performance?” Nangong Beidou said.

“I believe what Brother Nangong has said,” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said those words and then stood up. He looked to the Beitang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief and the Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief. Then, he said, “The one you all are afraid of right now is that man who possessed the Death Kill Brush. However, I can tell you all this with certainty. The greatest threat is definitely Chu Feng.”

“No matter how strong that other man is, he is only a rank three Martial Emperor. Taking care of him would not be hard.”

“However, Chu Feng will be much more difficult to manage. If he is to mature, our Four Great Imperial Clans will not be able to retain a footing in the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“Even if our Four Great Imperial Clans are able to continue to exist, we will only be like the numerous Royal Clans that have struggled on at death’s door.”

“If you all truly plan to bury your descendants’ future outlook and ruin the foundation set up by your ancestors for the sake of your own cowardice, then you can continue to remain silent like this.”

“Moreover, Brother Nangong and I have called you two here not for the sake of obtaining your assistance. We merely wished to warn you two out of kindness.”

“No matter how our Four Great Imperial Clans have fought with one another in the past, we still possess the same roots. I only hope that our Four Great Imperial Clans will be able to continue to prosper. I do not wish for us to, one day, become inferior to even the Nine Powers.”

“I’ve said all that I needed to say. Everyone, farewell,” After the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, he prepared to leave.

“Brother Ximen, wait a moment,” Right at this moment, the Beitang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly spoke to stop him. He sucked in a mouthful of air and then, as if he had made a great resolution, said, “This matter is extremely important. I’ll return and consult with the Utmost Exalted Elders first.”

“I will do the same,” The Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief also said.

Hearing those words, light smiles appeared on the faces of Nangong Beidou and the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief.

The two of them knew very well that, to those old monsters, the future of their Imperial Clans surpassed everything. If they knew of Chu Feng’s existence, they would definitely not let him live.

Afterward, the Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief and the Beitang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief both left. However, the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief did not leave. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, only the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief and Nangong Beidou remained.

“Chu Feng’s strength has started to appear. Even if our Four Clans are to join hands, it will still be quite difficult to take care of him.”

“All of this was caused by you. I wish to ask, as matters stand, have you once regretted your decision back then?” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief asked Nangong Beidou.

“Originally, you were able to be like them and not become Chu Feng’s enemy. Yet, you decided to join me. I also wish to ask, have you ever regretted your decision?” Nangong Beidou asked instead of answering.

“I, Ximen Chuanliu, am never one to regret,” When the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, coldness shined through his eyes. It was the determination to absolutely kill Chu Feng.

Afterward, the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief left. Nangong Beidou personally saw him off. However, when he looked to the direction where the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief left, a sorrowful expression appeared on Nangong Beidou’s face.

Actually, he had been regretting his actions since long ago. However, as matters stood, there was already no other choice left for him.

.........

At the moment when the Four Great Imperial Clans were plotting how to take care of Chu Feng, Chu Feng was completely ignorant as to what was happening. In fact, he didn’t even know about any of the recent things that had happened in the world.

After receiving the backlash from the Evil God Sword, Chu Feng had lost consciousness for a long time. It was only recently that he had woken up.

“Where is this?” Seeing the scene before him, Chu Feng’s heart tightened.

What appeared before him were countless bones. There were human bones and monstrous beast bones that were all gathered in one location and piled so high that it reached the clouds.

What appeared before him was the fishy smell of blood. There was so much blood that the depths could not be seen. With a gentle breeze, waves of blood that reached the heavens could be formed.

This place was truly a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood!!!

The reeking smell of blood was truly too strong. It had covered all of heaven and earth and dyed even the sky crimson. This place was simply hell.

Especially those bones; the larger ones among them could reach the skies. Even though they had been dead for a long time, their bones still contained their might, and gave Chu Feng an enormous pressure.

Those bones, even after death they were this frightening. How frightening must they have been when they were alive? Why would they all have died here?

Suddenly, a deep and gloomy voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ears. “You will not be able to conquer me. You’ll only end up being used by me.”

Hearing that voice, Chu Feng took several steps back in succession and, with a ‘putt,’ fell into the sea of blood.

From head to toe, and even the depths of his soul, Chu Feng started to tremble violently. Fear. This was the first time in his life that Chu Feng had felt this sort of fear.

“Who are you?” Chu Feng looked to his surroundings in the hopes of finding the person who had spoken those words.

“Wuu~~~” However, right at this moment, a sting of pain suddenly came from Chu Feng’s head. It was so painful that Chu Feng was unable to open his eyes.

“Chu Feng, Chu Feng, what happened to you?” At this moment, shouts could be heard. Following the shouts, the pain that Chu Feng felt began to dull.

Chu Feng opened his eyes again and discovered that he was lying in the middle of a forest. Baili Xuankong was before him and looking at him with a nervous expression on his face.

“Chu Feng, you’ve finally woken up,” Seeing that Chu Feng had woken up, Baili Xuankong finally managed to heave a sigh of relief. A slight smile appeared on his nervous face.

Chu Feng rubbed his still pained head and asked, “Ancestor, how long have I slept for?”

“Nearly two months,” Baili Xuankong said.

“That long?” Chu Feng was shocked.

Back then, he had left the Cyanwood Domain to go to the Cursed Soil Sect to save Tantai Xue, had gone to the Immortal Island, made his way to the Heavenly Law Auction, went to the Nangong Imperial Clan to stay as a guest, been chased into the Poison Demon’s Valley, and then arrived at Mooncloud City to cause troubles. Even though he had experienced all of those things and places, the time he had spent doing all of that was not long at all; it was only over ten months.

Chu Feng had never expected that he would sleep for nearly two months.

To the Chu Feng who was urgently trying to become stronger, this was truly an enormous waste of time.

“It has been a total of a year and twenty one days since you left the Cyanwood Mountain that day. However, your progress has been truly enormous,” Baili Xuankong praised.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled lightly. He knew that his Ancestor was praising him.

Indeed, who would dare to say that becoming a rank three Half Martial Emperor from a rank eight Martial King in the period of a year was not fast?

However, Chu Feng was not pleased with himself. He knew very well that in the vast Outer World, his talent might not be considered to be much at all. He most definitely could not slack off.

Suddenly, Baili Xuankong said with a very serious expression. “Oh, that’s right. Chu Feng, you absolutely must not use that Evil God Sword again.”

“Ancestor, exactly where did you obtain that Evil God Sword? How are you that certain that it’s the Evil God Sword?” Chu Feng asked with a serious expression. The reason for that was because that Evil God Sword was truly too strange and evil.

As Baili Xuankong sighed, he stood up and said, “You also know that our Cyanwood Mountain possesses an Ancient Era’s Remnant. Over the period of tens of thousand of years, our Cyanwood Mountain has explored that Ancient Era’s Remnants countless times. We have experienced countless casualties. Many of our great talents have died in there.”

“Everyone felt that Ancient Era’s Remnant to be a dangerous location of death. The truth is otherwise. Our Cyanwood Mountain has managed to obtain harvests from there. My Death Kill Brush and your Evil God Sword are both from there.”

“However, although these two weapons are very powerful, they’re truly too abnormal,” After speaking those words, a strong sense of worry appeared in Baili Xuankong’s eyes.
