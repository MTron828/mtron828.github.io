Chapter 2764 - Another Beauty

Chu Feng had actually already anticipated all of this. After all, real gold feared no fire. Chu Feng possessed actual ability. Sooner or later, he would reveal that.

Thus, Chu Feng was not only not angry about the matter, but he did not take it to heart at all.

While Chu Feng did not respond to Elder Xingyi after he received his apology, Chu Feng did return a smile to Elder Xingyi.

He was telling Elder Xingyi that he did not have to burden himself with this matter because he, Chu Feng, had not taken this matter to heart.

That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder inspected the glass ball in Xia Yun’er’s hand. After he discovered that it was real, he was very surprised.

He felt that while Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists being able to turn the glass ball golden within the time limit was something within expectations, it would be extremely difficult for a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to turn the glass ball golden within the time limit.

“Am I able to go in now?” Xia Yun’er asked that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder.

“Go on ahead,” That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder nodded.

Seeing that, Han Yu hurriedly walked up to that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder and took out his own glass ball.

He truly did not wish to miss out on the opportunity to interact with Xia Yun’er at a close distance.

After he got closer to Xia Yun’er, he even revealed an amiable smile at her.

Truth be told, with Han Yu’s status and strength, that sort of smile would be able to woo any of the other young women present.

However, Han Yu was extremely lacking in confidence when facing Xia Yun’er. After all, he had attempted to converse with Xia Yun’er many times already. Yet, she did not even bother to pay the slightest bit of attention to him.

However, this time around, Han Yu was surprised.

The reason for that was because after Han Yu cast his charming and handsome smile at Xia Yun’er, Xia Yun’er actually returned a charming smile back at him.

At that moment, it would not even be excessive to say that Han Yu was bursting with joy.

He thought to himself that his efforts had finally paid off, that he had finally managed to achieve something, managed to obtain a return.

He felt that Xia Yun’er must be smiling with such love toward him because of his golden glass ball.

He determined that he would definitely continue to perform properly. He felt that as long as his performance was sufficient, Xia Yun’er would one day fall in love with him.

However, right at the moment when Han Yu was thinking about the future nonstop, at the moment when he was truly thinking that Xia Yun’er had a change in attitude for the better toward him, Xia Yun’er turned around and looked toward Chu Feng.

“Young master Chu Feng, let us enter together.”

“Buzz~~~”

Once those words were said, Han Yu felt a buzz in his head. He nearly exploded on the spot. He was about to be infuriated to death.

He was not angry because of Xia Yun’er. Instead, his anger was completely aimed toward Chu Feng.

He felt that if it wasn’t for Chu Feng, Xia Yun’er would not be treating him like this.

After all, he had met with Xia Yun’er several times already in the past. At that time, the two of them were getting along with one another very well.

Thinking about this, Han Yu did not say anything else. Instead, he took a fierce glance at Chu Feng before directly entering the path to the maze.

As for Chu Feng, he did not hesitate either. With his glass ball in hand, he, together with Li Xiang and the others, proceeded to walk toward that path.

Originally, Chu Feng and the others had thought that they would be able to ascend the mountain directly. However, as they continued to walk down the spirit formation path, they soon discovered an enormous palace before them.

That palace stopped their path forward.

Furthermore, the entrance to the palace was open. There were even guards from the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan standing by the entrance. It was as if they were waiting for their arrival.

This made Chu Feng and the others realize that it seemed to be quite difficult to enter that maze formation.

Even though they already held guesses in their hearts, Chu Feng and the others did not ask too much about this. Instead, they directly entered the palace before them.

Upon entering the palace, they discovered that there were a lot of people gathered in the palace. Furthermore, they were all members of the younger generation.

They were people from all different powers. It could be said that all of the major powers within the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were represented here.

At that moment, even Chu Feng gasped with admiration. He gasped at the fact that there were truly a lot of people who had arrived at the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.

After all, the people of the younger generation gathered here would only be a portion of all of them. After all, there should be a lot of people that chose to enter that training formation.

That said, Chu Feng also noticed that the people there were all holding a glass ball in their hand.

However, the glass balls that the majority of the people here held were all in their original transparent, colorless state.

“It would appear that what that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder said was the truth. They were really deliberately making things difficult for you all,” Her Lady Queen said with joy at others’ misfortune.

If it wasn’t for the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan deliberately making things difficult, then those Starfall Holy Land’s younger generation would not have been unable to enter this place.

It was precisely because of this deliberate difficulty that those Starfall Holy Land’s younger generations failed to enter the palace.

They were careless and did not set up a spirit formation. Instead, they began to instill their spirit power into the glass balls directly.

Because of that, they all ended up failing, and were unable to even attain the cyan color. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Han Yu. Look, it’s young master Han Yu!”

“Isn’t that Chu Feng? Brother Chu Feng, you’ve also come?”

“Who is that beauty? She’s so beautiful. Heavens, she’s simply too beautiful. Her beauty is likely comparable to Lady Chu Lingxi’s beauty.”

After Chu Feng and the others arrived, they soon caught the attention of the crowd present there. Practically everyone’s gaze was focused on the eight of them.

A lot of people present recognized Han Yu. From this, it could be seen that Han Yu was truly renowned in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

However, there were also a small portion of people that recognized Chu Feng. The great majority of them were people from the Immortal Armament Villa. They had seen Chu Feng in the hunting competition.

That being said, the people present, regardless of gender or age, were mostly focused on Xia Yun’er.

From this, it could be seen that regardless of where one might be, beauties would always be popular.

Merely, as Xia Yun’er rarely showed herself, very few people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm had seen her before.

Thus, the majority of the crowd did not know who she was.

“Shhh, don’t make random remarks. That is the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun’er.”

That being said, there were quite a few knowledgeable individuals in the palace. One such individual revealed Xia Yun’er’s identity.

“It’s actually one of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Three Great Beauties, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun’er?”

“No wonder, no wonder she’s so beautiful and resembles a celestial fairy.”

Upon finding out Xia Yun’er identity, the crowd’s gaze grew even more heated.

After all, the title of the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter was extremely dazzling. Thus, upon finding out Xia Yun’er’s identity, she became even more noble in their eyes.

Even though Xia Yun’er had nothing on her, her body seemed to be radiating a halo of light in the eyes of the crowd. It was extremely sparkling.

“Move aside!”

Right at that moment, a shout suddenly sounded from deep within the palace hall.

When that shout was heard, a powerful oppressive might could be felt.

The next moment, the crowd immediately moved to either side and revealed a path before Chu Feng and the others’ field of view.

Looking through that path, one could see deep inside the palace hall. At that place were gathered over a hundred individuals.

Those people were all wearing gorgeous clothing. Furthermore, they were all from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, when they cast their eyes over, the crowd were unable to help themselves from having their attention captured by a figure.

It was a young woman. Her appearance was very youthful, like that of a young girl.

Beautiful, extremely beautiful.

If Xia Yun’er’s beauty was akin to that of a celestial fairy, that this woman’s beauty was filled with ingeniousness and purity. Her skin was extremely fair. She gave off a single sensation -- neat and clean.

At that moment, she was sitting on top of something that resembled a table. Her beautiful legs were rocking back and forth nonstop. This made her seem very attractive, cute and fascinating.
