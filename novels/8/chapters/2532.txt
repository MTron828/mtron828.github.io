Chapter 2532 - Heaven Level Lightning Mark

“Roar~~~”

That secret skill was extremely powerful. Although it had yet to reach the power of the Ancient Era’s War Axe, being so powerful that it could surpass an entire level of cultivation, it was still extremely powerful.

As Young Master Li Ming possessed cultivation a level above Chu Feng, it allowed Young Master Li Ming’s secret skill to beat back Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe repeatedly.

“Chu Feng, you were correct, this girl possesses numerous abilities. She cannot be looked down upon.”

“Sure enough, she cannot be discussed alongside someone like Kong Doumoyuan.”

Her Lady Queen was growing more and more high-spirited the more she watched. As she saw the numerous abilities Young Master Li Ming had grasped, she was not only not worried, she even grew excited.

The reason why she was not worried for Chu Feng was because she knew that Chu Feng still possessed three abilities that he had not used.

Firstly, there was Chu Feng’s Divine Mark. The power of his Divine Mark was far superior to other Lightning Marks. Although Chu Feng was at a disadvantage now, Her Lady Queen felt that Chu Feng would be able to turn the battle around the moment he used his Divine Mark.

Apart from the Lightning Mark, Chu Feng also possessed another secret skill from the Ancient Era’s War Clan, the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

The Ancient Era’s War Sword was the strongest of the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Three Great Secret Skills. It was a secret skill that even Zhan Haichuan had failed to subdue.

Not only was the Ancient Era’s War Sword stronger than the Ancient Era’s War Axe, but it was even stronger than Zhan Haichuan’s Ancient Era’s War Spear.

Merely, the Ancient Era’s War Sword was too powerful. As such, it was very hard to control it.

Chu Feng was currently still unable to use the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

However, After Chu Feng’s cultivation reached rank eight Martial Ancestor and he used his Lightning Mark, he had mentioned to Her Lady Queen that although he was unable to completely control the Ancient Era’s War Sword, he would be able to use it when absolutely necessary.

Merely, using the Ancient Era’s War Sword would definitely overload his body. He would inevitably be affected by it.

To put it simply, if Chu Feng were to go all-out, he would be able to unleash a portion of the Ancient Era’s War Sword’s power.

Merely, like using the Evil God Sword, using the Ancient Era’s War Sword would tax his body enormously, and he might even receive a backlash after using it.

Thus, as long as Chu Feng was able to not use the Ancient Era’s War Sword, he would not use it. In the end, the Ancient Era’s War Sword was a technique to preserve Chu Feng’s life. It was a trump card that Chu Feng would only use when he had no other options.

Of course, apart from the Ancient Era’s War Sword, Chu Feng still possessed one final ability, the Evil God Sword.

If Chu Feng were to use the Ancient Era’s War Axe, he would still not necessarily be able to escape from True Immortals.

However, should he use the Evil God Sword, even ordinary True Immortals would not be able to escape from it alive.

This was the strongest trump card that Chu Feng possessed at the moment. However, it was also the ability that Chu Feng possessed that would cause the greatest amount of trouble, the trump card that he did not dare to use the most. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Her Lady Queen felt that as long as Chu Feng possessed those three trump cards, he would possess boundless possibilities.

During crucial moments, Chu Feng would not fear even True Immortals. As such, how could he possibly fear a Martial Ancestor?

That was the reason why Her Lady Queen was able to remain this calm. She knew that Chu Feng would definitely win.

“Girl, exactly what is your origin? How could you possess this many abilities?”

“However, I must say that even though your little golden lion is bold and powerful, it’s actually still weaker than my Ancient Era’s War Axe.”

“Your little golden lion is only able to contend against my Ancient Era’s War Axe because your cultivation is a level above mine.”

“Thus, girl, if you really detest me to the bones, then you should kill me right away.”

“Else, once my cultivation catches up to yours, once I become a rank nine Martial Ancestor like you, at that time... you will no longer be able to contend against me.”

Chu Feng was confident. Although he was in a disadvantaged situation right now, he was still teasing, mocking and provoking Young Master Li Ming nonstop.

Young Master Li Ming was originally a very calm individual. She was someone that would simply not be affected by ordinary provocations. This could be seen in her match against Chu Feng on Mount Cloud Crane.

However, Chu Feng had infringed upon Young Master Li Ming’s baseline when he accidently touched her breasts.

Everyone possessed a baseline, something that could not be infringed upon. If one were to infringe upon it, one would not be spared.

Thus, as long as Chu Feng continued to provoke Young Master Li Ming using that, she would definitely be enraged.

“Very well, since you wish to die this much, I will grant you your wish and kill you right away.”

Young Master Li Ming’s tonce grew increasingly ice-cold. Then, lightning began to gather on her forehead.

“Are you going to use your Lightning Mark?”

“Very well, I am quite interested in seeing what sort of Lightning Mark you will have.”

Seeing this scene, Chu Feng revealed a serious and anticipating expression.

Chu Feng subconsciously felt that Young Master Li Ming’s Lightning Mark was most likely not the lowest Mortal level Lightning Mark.

That was the reason why he was anticipating so much. He wanted to know exactly what sort of Lightning Mark a genius like her would possess.

He wanted to know whether it would be an Earthen level Lightning Mark or a Mortal level Lightning Mark.

Under Chu Feng’s serious gaze, Young Master Li Ming’s Lightning Mark finally condensed on her forehead.

At the moment the Lightning Mark was formed, a boundless aura began to emit from Young Master Li Ming’s body.

At that moment, not only was Young Master Li Ming’s body covered with lightning, but there was also nine-colored lightning present all over the sky. Like lightning dragons, they would appear and disappear from time to time and let out thunderous roars.

“It’s actually this level!!!”

At that moment, Chu Feng’s expression changed. Even though he had prepared himself beforehand, Chu Feng still never expected Young Master Li Ming’s Lightning Mark to be at this level.

On Young Master Li Ming’s forehead was the character ‘Heaven’, condensed with nine-colored lightning.

Heaven level Lightning Mark, this was the Lightning Mark that Young Master Li Ming had grasped.

Young Master Li Ming had actually trained in the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique, a Self-Punishing Mysterious Technique second to only the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

“It’s too late to be scared now.”

As Young Master Li Ming spoke, she unleashed her power that she had received from her Heaven level Lightning Mark.

“Rooarr~~~”

At that moment, that golden lion reacted as if it was shot with hormones and let out a loud, ear-piercing roar.

At that moment, it seemed like that lion’s body had grown much bigger. The aura it emitted also grew much more powerful.

If Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe was still able to withstand the lion’s attack even though it was being beaten back, then, at that moment, Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe was no longer able to withstand the golden lion’s attacks.

That said, even though he was being absolutely suppressed and the golden lion was soon to breach the Ancient Era’s War Axe and reach him, Chu Feng still did not reveal any fear. Instead, he shook his head helplessly and said with a sigh, “There’s nothing I can do about it. It would seem that if I do not beat you into submission, you will not give up.”

“Beat me into submission? What makes you think you can do that?” A ridiculing gaze appeared in Young Master Li Ming’s eyes.

She felt that as long as she used the power of her Heaven level Lightning Mark, she would grasp absolute victory.

Even if Chu Feng were to use his Lightning Mark, he would still not be able to contend against her. After all, she had used the most powerful Heaven level Lightning Mark.

She felt that Chu Feng was overestimating his capabilities, that he was indulging in fantasy by saying those words.

“Zzzzz~~~”

Right at that moment, dazzling nine-colored lightning suddenly appeared around Chu Feng.

The nine-colored lightning began to spiral around Chu Feng as it soared into the sky. Both their quantity and size were many times greater than Young Master Li Ming’s lightning.

Most importantly, a character had appeared on Chu Feng’s forehead.

It was a character condensed by nine-colored lightning, it was the character ‘Divine.’
