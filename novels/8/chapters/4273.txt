Chapter 4273 - Immemorial Cosmos Map

“Did you think your master I do not wish to reveal my true identity and disclose what happened back then?”

“It’s just that it’s still not time yet.”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that you were being bullied by those people and your master I am unable to watch with folded arms, if it wasn’t for obtaining the inheritance, your master I would not choose to reveal myself today,” sighed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“It’s still not time yet?”

“Master, what do you mean by that?” asked Chu Feng.

“If my guess is correct, Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted should’ve comprehended rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation.”

“As for me, I am still only rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation. I am still some distance away from reaching rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“He had comprehended rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation?”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized everything. He also knew why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was unwilling to reveal his true identity.

After all, rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation possess a battle power on par with rank six Martial Exalted.

That strength would rank one among the top level existences in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.

If the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had truly reached rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation, Ox-nosed Old Daoist would not be a match for him.

As long as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist doesn’t reveal his identity, even if the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted sought him out to cause troubles for him, he would not necessarily insist on killing him.

But, if he was to reveal his identity and let the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted realize that he was Zhuge Yuankong, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted will put forth all efforts to eliminate him.

“Wait. Master, something’s amiss. How did you know that I knew you’re Zhuge Yuankong?” asked Chu Feng all of a sudden.

“This old man knows a lot of things. This includes the fact that you’ve already grasped the grand formation this old man set up and could teleport to various locations connected to that grand formation.”

Ox-nosed Old Daoist stroked his head and spoke with pride.

“Master, could it be that you’ve placed a spy beside me?”

“Or could it be that you’ve been secretly monitoring me yourself?” asked Chu Feng. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You don’t have to worry about that.”

“Handle this inheritance first. After this, I will bring you to the Galewind Hunting Clan to make inquiries about your three little companions,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Master, you’re willing to bring me to the Galewind Hunting Clan?”

“But, didn’t senior Tang Chen say that the Galewind Hunting Clan’s powers are unfathomable, that one must not rashly enter into their territory?” Chu Feng was pleasantly surprised.

He was delighted to learn that someone was able to bring him to the Galewind Hunting Clan to seek out the secrets regarding Yan Ruyu and others.

But, he was also worried. After all, Grandmaster Tang Chen mentioned the Galewind Hunting Clan was very dangerous.

“While it is indeed dangerous, how could a master disregard the matters of his disciple?”

“But, you don’t have to worry. Your master is confident in being able to enter the Galewind Hunting Clan.”

“Let’s not bother with superfluous words now. Let’s handle this inheritance first.”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he arrived before the stele.

“Buzz---”

Once his palm touched the stele, light began to circulate through the stele.

The power within the stele seemed to be seeking out an exit. It entered the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s body through his palm.

Soon, the light on the stele disappeared completely. The sacred aura also disappeared.

The stele seemed to have been reduced to a completely useless stone.

“Snap---”

“Snap---”

Soon, the stele shattered and scattered into dust.

Even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s isolation formation was around the area and there was no wind at all, the dust drifted away.

Chu Feng knew that the inheritance of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain has been obtained by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Merely, the method of inheritance was much smoother than Chu Feng anticipated.

Because of that, he felt very happy.

“Master, how’s the inheritance?” Chu Feng asked in high spirits.

But, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not respond.

Upon closer inspection, Chu Feng discovered light was roaming through the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s body. That light seemed very sacred.

As for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he stood completely motionless as if he had been petrified.

Even his eyes were not blinking at all.

Seeing this, Chu Feng no longer attempted to bother the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

He felt that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s spirit and consciousness might be projected elsewhere right now.

Perhaps he was seeing the master of this Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

Or perhaps he was seeing the owner of that ancient voice.

He must be undergoing some sort of conversation right now.

No matter what Chu Feng says at a time like this, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would not be able to hear him.

The only thing Chu Feng could do was to wait patiently.

This situation lasted for two entire hours.

After two hours passed, the light roaming through the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s body began to enter his body. Finally, he woke up.

“Hehe. My good disciple, this inheritance is truly extraordinary. This is simply a big treasure. Your master I have benefited from your good fortune.”

Ox-nosed Old Daoist was unable to conceal his happiness after regaining consciousness. One could tell how joyous he was just by seeing the yellow teeth that covered his face.

But, perhaps because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s appearance was truly too wretched, his smile resembled the smile of a vile character who succeeded in their scheme. It does not resemble the smile of a good man.

But, Chu Feng was not concerned about whether the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s smile was good-looking or not. He was only curious about the inheritance.

“Master, exactly what sort of inheritance was it?” asked Chu Feng curiously.

Seeing how the Ox-nosed Old Daoist praised it, Chu Feng knew that the inheritance must be remarkable.

“This inheritance is related to world spirit techniques. Master will not tell you what it is right now. In the future, when I impart it to you, you will know what it is.”

“That said, Chu Feng, your master I am a world spiritist. As this inheritance is of use to world spiritists, is it possible for you to allow master to learn it for the time being? Once I mastered it, I will then impart it to you.”

“You can rest assured. This inheritance is not a cultivation resource. Thus, when master imparts it to you, it will be completely intact. Your usage of it will not be affected,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He was quite a realistic person.

He was totally capable of making up a reason as to why he will not impart the inheritance to Chu Feng right now. After all, the inheritance was with him. Only he knew what was going on with that inheritance.

But, he did not try to deceive Chu Feng. Instead, he chose to tell Chu Feng the truth.

He wanted to train with the inheritance and thus did not wish to hand it to Chu Feng yet.

“Master, go ahead and train with it. Once you master it, you can then impart it to this disciple.”

“This disciple is in no rush.”

Chu Feng did not oppose it at all.

He knew that even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was smiling gleefully, he was carrying a heavy hatred.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist needed to seek revenge. The best method for him to obtain revenge would not be through martial power. Rather, it would be through world spirit techniques. He needed to thoroughly defeat the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted with his world spirit techniques.

Since this inheritance was useful for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu feng would naturally not be stingy with it.

Truth be told, if the choice was given to him, he would’ve chosen to have the Ox-nosed Old Daoist train with the inheritance first.

“You’re truly my good disciple. Master has benefitted from your good fortune.”

Seeing that Chu Feng did not object, Ox-nosed Old Daoist became even more happy.

“Master, earlier, did you manage to meet with the senior of this place?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was not overly interested in the inheritance.

The reason for that was because he trusted the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

He knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist will impart the inheritance to him sooner or later. Regardless of what the inheritance might be, he will learn of its identity then.

What Chu Feng was very curious about was that ancient voice. He wanted to know exactly who the owner of that voice was.

The owner of that voice was most definitely someone very powerful. Why would someone as powerful as that decide to stay in this place?

Furthermore, why would that person be imparting the inheritance of this place to others?

“That is someone grand. I didn’t manage to meet that person either. As such, I have no idea who that person is.”

“My good disciple, master knows that you’re very curious. But, since that grand lord is unwilling to reveal his identity, we can’t do anything about it either.”

“The world of martial cultivation is truly vast. There are a lot of hidden experts. Their way of thoughts are also completely different from each other.”

“Some set up remnants for the sake of passing on their abilities to others because they feared that their abilities will be lost with them.”

“Some would bluntly manifest their abilities so that the people of the world would know how powerful they are.”

“As for some others, they do these sort of things merely as a pastime activity.”

“They simply felt things to be amusing to watch as others breach the situations and formations they’ve arranged.”

“You don’t have to worry about what they were thinking. As long as it’s not someone that caused you harm, they’re good people.”

“As for us, all that matters is that we receive benefits from them.”

“With your talent, as long as you continue to train, you will one day reach their heights. Even surpassing them would not be difficult.”

“Thus, why bother to be concerned about them?”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke those words very naturally. He doesn’t seem to be overly encouraging Chu Feng. Instead, it seemed like he firmly believed that Chu Feng would be able to reach that level of success.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist thought very highly of Chu Feng’s future.

“Mn. What master said is very true,” Chu Feng nodded his head in agreement.

He felt that before he reached that level, there were indeed things that he cannot touch upon.

“Sigh. My good disciple, are you truly not curious as to what sort of inheritance master received?”

“Why did you decide to not ask just because I decide to not tell you about it?”

Suddenly, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist looked to Chu Feng with a mischievous smile.

“I’m not curious. After all, master will be imparting it to me sooner or later,” said Chu Feng.

“Kid, your heart is truly broad.”

“But, the less curious you are, the more I wanted to tell you about it.”

“This inheritance is extremely exceptional. It is called the Immemorial Cosmos Map.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was radiating with delight and extremely proud of himself as he said those words.
