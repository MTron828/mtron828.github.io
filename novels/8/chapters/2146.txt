Chapter 2146 - Resurrection Again

“Hahaha, great, this is truly great. I had originally thought that Chu Feng being able to ascend to the eighth step was already pretty decent.”

“But it turns out this Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was actually strengthened. Chu Feng’s performance actually surpassed even yours.”

“Haha, surpassing the old, this is most definitely surpassing the old. Great, this is truly great,” The Old Ape was extremely excited, and smiling widely from being incapable of concealing his happiness. In fact, he was even slapping his thigh.

At that moment, Zi Ling had managed to understand what had happened from the dialogue. At that moment, she was also smiling sweetly. She was truly feeling happy for Chu Feng.

“Zi Ling, Feng’er will meet great hardships after entering the Outer World. However, you will not necessarily be able to live more comfortably than him here.”

“Likely, you will not be able to rest for all of the following days. The intensity of the training that I’ve prepared for you will surpass everything that you’ve ever experienced.”

“However, this is the only path that you can take to become stronger. I will remold your Divine Power. It will be a pain that you’ve never experienced before.”

“If you wish to attain a rebirth, you must first transform yourself. If you wish to transform yourself, this is the only method.”

“Are you prepared?” Chu Xuanyuan said as he looked to Zi Ling.

“Mn,” Zi Ling nodded her head resolutely. Unwavering determination flashed through her beautiful eyes.

After journeying for some time, Chu Feng finally arrived at the Eastern Sea Region’s Nine Provinces Continent.

He once again arrived at the Golden-purple City. He discovered that all the people present that day did not proceed to the Azure Dragon School to rest. Instead, they all remained in the Golden-purple City to wait for Chu Feng’s return.

The reason for that was because after they saw Chu Feng’s return, the expressions of the crowd all turned serious.

After seeing Chu Feng returning by himself, Xian Miaomiao stepped forward and asked, “Chu Feng, where are the Four Great Divine Beasts?”

Thus, as Chu Feng explained what happened, he revealed the Four Great Supreme Secret Skills.

“This... they were turned into secret skills?” Xian Miaomiao asked in astonishment. The others also revealed expressions of shock.

“To be exact, they’ve returned to being secret skills. They were only resurrected for the sake of helping me. However, they were unable to keep that sort of state for an extended period of time. Returning to being secret skills is currently for the best,” Chu Feng explained.

“So that’s the case,” Hearing Chu Feng’s explaination, the crowd revealed relieved expressions.

“Chu Feng, this is strange, your aura!!!” Right at that moment, Xian Miaomiao looked at Chu Feng with an astonished expression. Her beautiful eyes were opened extremely wide .

“Chu Feng, you... you’re actually a rank one Half Martial Ancestor now?” At the very next moment, all of the crowd were astonished. They discovered that Chu Feng’s aura was no longer that of a rank seven Martial Emperor. Instead, he had became an actual rank one Half Martial Ancestor.

“W-W-What the hell is w-w-with this? You w-w-were away f-for only a s-short period of time, y-yet you gained three l-levels of c-cultivation. A-Are y-you trying to k-k-kill me here?” Wang Qiang also had an expression filled with astonishment. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Originally, as Wang Qiang was already a rank one Half Martial Ancestor, he was much more powerful than Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng had now managed to catch up to him.

“It is because of my father’s help,” Chu Feng did not conceal this matter from the crowd. After all, they all knew that he had entered the Heavenly Road to meet his father.

“Ssss~~~” At this moment, everyone sucked in a mouthful of cold air.

Those that knew Chu Feng all knew how difficult it was for him to reach a single breakthrough in his cultivation. It was already extremely unimaginable that Chu Feng was able to become a rank seven Martial Emperor.

However, Chu Feng’s father had managed to let him become a rank one Half Martial Ancestor that easily. From that, the crowd were able to conclude how powerful of a person Chu Feng’s father was.

“Chu Feng, what kind of fun did you enjoy in the Heavenly Road? Quickly, tell me about it. I have never been through the Heavenly Road before,” Xian Miaomiao asked with a curious expression. Of course, she was mainly asking that because she wanted to know about Chu Feng’s father. This girl was truly filled with curiosity.

As for Chu Feng, he did not bother to conceal anything. He answered all the questions from the crowd. After all, the people here were all people he trusted. Although they were not related to him by blood, they were, to Chu Feng, no different from relatives.

Suddenly, Bai Ruochen asked, “Chu Feng, in that case... are you planning to leave for the Outer World now?”

Once Bai Ruochen’s question was heard, the entire crowd grew quiet. Regardless of whether they were men or women, young or old, they all revealed expressions of reluctance to part.

Chu Feng was not someone that could be kept in this pond. Entering the Outer World was something he would do sooner or later. Furthermore, he had already done all that he should do here. As such, it was indeed time for him to leave for the Outer World.

“Yes, I’ll be leaving. However, before leaving, I must first revive my family members,” As Chu Feng spoke, he landed in Golden-purple City.

Seeing that, the crowd all revealed serious expressions. Worry could be seen in their eyes. At that moment, everyone turned their gazes toward Chu Guyu, Chu Yue and the others from the Chu Family.

“Little brother, don’t bother attempting it again,” Chu Guyu arrived beside Chu Feng.

“Little brother Chu Feng, the dead cannot be revived. You shouldn’t cling to the dead like this. It will end up holding you back.”

“Chu Feng, you still have a lot of things that you must do. Furthermore, everyone’s deaths cannot be blamed on you. Thus, you don’t have to continue to blame yourself.”

Chu Yue, Chu Zhen and the others also arrived beside Chu Feng and began to persuade Chu Feng against it in succession.

It turned out that everyone was worried that Chu Feng would harm himself and even die by insisting on using the resurrection secret technique repeatedly.

After all, everyone had noticed how determined Chu Feng was when he used the secret resurrection technique last time around.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the Heavenly Road was about to open before, it was likely that no one would be able to persuade Chu Feng to stop. Thus, they truly did not wish for Chu Feng to continue to attempt using the secret resurrection technique to revive the Chu Family.

They were all afraid that Chu Feng would fail again should he try once more, that he would refuse to give up and ruin his grand future prospects here.

“I know what you all are thinking,” Seeing the worried expressions of the crowd, Chu Feng started to smile.

“However, you all can rest assured, because it is definitely going to succeed this time around. The reason for that is because this resurrection technique is something that my father gave me,” As Chu Feng spoke, he flipped his palm and revealed the spirit formation that was presented to him by his father.

“That is?” Seeing that spirit formation, everyone’s gazes started to shine.

However, Chu Feng did not give the crowd the time to ponder it. Instead, he directly activated the spirit formation. The reason for that was because he was extremely determined to resurrect the Chu Family as quickly as possible.

“Buzz~~~”

Once the spirit formation was activated, a dazzling light immediately covered the entire region. Following that light, layer upon layer of ripples visible to the naked eye began to be emitted from the spirit formation.

The ripples were very strong. Everyone was able to sense that the spirit formation Chu Feng was using right now was many times more powerful than the secret resurrection technique Chu Feng had used before.

However, the extremely powerful energy ripples did not affect any object or harm any of the people present.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Not long after the ripples began to spread, transparent bodies of light soon began to fly toward it.

The bodies of light grew more and more numerous. Furthermore, they started to fuse with one another. Soon, they formed many complete bodies of light.

To be exact, those were spirit bodies.
