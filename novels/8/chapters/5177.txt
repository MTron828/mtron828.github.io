Chapter 5177: The Talented Young Master Wolf

With a thrust of his palm, the master’s spirit power manifested into a golden palm print that swiftly expanded as it ascended into the sky. Within moments, it had already grown to tens of thousands of meters.

He had made an example out of the person who dared to challenge them so that the others wouldn’t dare to fight back. This was how the strong dealt with the weak.

Weng!

Astonishingly, the palm print suddenly halted before the source of the voice.

Boom!

The palm print exploded, and the spirit power within it scattered into the surroundings as specks of light. The spirit power encircling those from the Nine Levels Pavilion dissipated as well.

Even the two masters had to retreat several steps before they were able to regain their balance.

They clutched their chest, and blood was flowing from their seven apertures. Clearly, they had suffered severe internal injuries.

This sight shocked the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster and Yue Ling’s master.

Those two masters were rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation World Spiritists, but they were already injured before a fight could break out!

“Useless old things. You speak big words for mere weaklings,” the voice from earlier sneered.

A person started descending from the sky, eventually landing in front of the Nine Level Pavilion’s sectmaster. It was a plump young man dressed in black. He had a human body, but he had the head of a wolf.

He was emanating the aura of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator, a fairly powerful one at that. That explained how he was able to easily injure the two rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation World Spiritists.

“My gosh. Is it possible that he is…?”

The faces of the two masters paled in horror upon seeing the wolf-headed young man.

The eyes of Yue Ling, her master, and the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster also widened in despair.

“What’s wrong, you two old things? Do you recognize me now?” the wolf-headed young man asked in derision.

“Of course we do. How could we possibly have not heard about young master Wolf?” the two masters replied subserviently.

“He… really is young master Wolf?” Yue Ling blurted out.

Yue Ling’s master and the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster were dumbfounded by the confirmation too.

The Nine Levels Pavilion’s army and the witnessing powers revealed looks of glee. They looked at those from the Nameless Sect almost as if they were looking at clowns.

This made Chu Feng realize that young master Wolf was likely to be a famous cultivator with a formidable background, or else the others wouldn’t have reacted in such a manner.

Nevertheless, he still sent a voice transmission to ask Yue Ling about it, “Yue Ling, what’s that guy’s background?”

Yue Ling quickly explained young master Wolf’s background to Chu Feng.

Young master Wolf had suddenly appeared in the Bittershore Starfield three years ago. No one knew where he was from, but with his tremendous strength, he swiftly built a reputation for himself. People came to dub him as one of the most talented juniors of the Bittershore Starfield.

In fact, it was out of respect for the other powers that he was only dubbed as ‘one of the most talented juniors’. If not for his unknown background, no one would dare question his credential as the most talented junior of the Bittershore Starfield.

Naturally, this was not a person they could offend. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Benefactor, you shouldn’t get involved in this matter. This is not a person we can get on the bad side of,” Yue Ling said.

Chu Feng didn’t respond to her words, choosing instead to observe the situation.

He was here to help them. It would be meaningless if his intervention brought them future problems instead, so he had to be prudent.

While he was trying to get a grasp on young master Wolf’s background, the two masters continued their conversation with the latter, though ‘begging for mercy’ might be more apt here.

“Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster, how do you wish to deal with them? Shall I kill them?” young master Wolf asked.

“Young master Wolf, you call the shots here,” the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster replied fawningly.

He was delighted with the situation since he was planning to eradicate the Nameless Sect right from the start. He was just worried that going to such lengths would sully his reputation, so he was planning to deal with them secretly later on.

However, if young master Wolf was willing to do them this favor, he would be spared from the additional trouble. After all, who would dare to oppose young master Wolf in this Lower Realm?

“How loyal are the two of you?” young master Wolf asked the two masters.

“Young master Wolf, the two of us are as loyal as dogs. We won’t forget your grace if you spare us today!” the two masters exclaimed.

Those words brought a frown to young master Wolf’s face.

“How regretful. I could have considered sparing the two of you today if you aren’t loyal. If you insist on clinging onto your allegiance, I’m afraid that I can’t let you go,” young master Wolf said.

“Young master Wolf, what do you mean by that?” the two masters were confused.

“We’re all here for the conflict between the Nine Levels Pavilion and the Nameless Sect. I have no interest in oppressing those as weak as the Nameless Sect; that’d only sully my reputation. It would make things much easier for me if you were disloyal bastards who turn on their own people. What do you think?” young master Wolf asked with narrowed eyes.

The two masters immediately understood what he was getting at. They turned around and directed chilling looks toward the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster.

“Masters, you can’t do that!”

The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster panicked. He knew that those two masters were selfish people who had no qualms turning on him for their survival.

“Nameless Sect’s sectmaster, this is simply the way the world is. What’s most important in the world of cultivation is one’s life. I hope that you won’t blame us for this; we don’t have a choice either.”

The two masters sneered. They released their spirit power and sealed off the escape routes of the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster and the others.

“Hold on,” young master Wolf suddenly spoke up.

He turned his eyes to Yue Ling and said, “Young miss, you seem to be a disciple of the Nameless Sect. I don’t want to implicate the innocent here. It just so happens that I am without a female companion recently. If you’re willing to come with me, I’ll not only ensure your safety but also handsomely compensate you.”

Young master Wolf was interested in Yue Ling, hoping for the latter to serve him.

“You… Dream on!” Yue Ling bellowed in response.

“What a pity.”

Young master Wolf wasn’t bothered by Yue Ling’s rejection. Yue Ling was indeed pretty, but she couldn’t compare with top-notch beauties such as Long Xiaoxiao, Xian Miaomiao, and the others.

Thus, he turned to the two masters and ordered, “Do it.”

“Young master Wolf, how should we kill them?” the two masters asked.

“That’s up to you. Just make it as interesting as possible,” young master Wolf replied.

“Understood.”

With malevolent smiles, the two masters channeled their spirit power and manifested millions of swords around those from the Nameless Sect, encircling them. To appease young master Wolf, they planned to slice those from the Nameless Sect into shreds in the most brutal way possible!

Those from the Nine Levels Pavilion showed vile smiles upon seeing the formation.

Yue Ling closed her eyes. Having already told Chu Feng not to intervene in this matter, she was prepared to meet her end.

Yue Ling’s master thought that Chu Feng had already left too, especially when he thought about the awful attitude of the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster earlier on.

“Sectmaster, are those the helpers you’ve found to help us?” Yue Ling’s master sneered.

He would have never dared to disrespect the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster under normal circumstances, but after all that had happened, he didn’t think that the latter was worth his respect anymore.

The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster also knew that he was at fault here. He could only vent his anger at the two masters.

“You beasts! To think I trusted you! I’ll haunt you till the end of time! I won’t allow you to have peace of mind!”

The howls of the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster sounded awfully weak.
