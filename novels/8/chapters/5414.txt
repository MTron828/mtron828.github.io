Chapter 5414: Martial Power Formation

Feng Ling’s cultivation eventually stopped at rank four Half-God level.

Chu Feng was also able to raise his cultivation by three ranks, but he knew that this was a feat beyond most cultivators. Most prodigies he knew could only raise their cultivation by two ranks at Half-God level.

“That girl is pretty interesting. It doesn’t look like a Divine Power. Is it her bloodline power?” Eggy asked.

“It does look like her bloodline power, but I can’t be sure about that,” Chu Feng replied.

The ghastly wails were already very close by then, allowing Chu Feng to see their true nature. They were coming from a flood of martial power containing souls manifesting in the form of humanoid beings. These souls were the ones releasing the ghastly wails.

The souls quickly surrounded the pedestal, but they were staved off by the protective formation. Chu Feng tried to sense how powerful the flood of martial power and the souls were, but he failed to pick up anything.

Meanwhile, Feng Ling walked out into the spirit formation gate, which transported her out of the protective formation. The souls immediately noticed her and charged at her.

“Rank four Half-God! That’s a martial power formation!” Chu Feng exclaimed.

He hadn’t been able to sense how powerful the souls were, but they were immediately revealed to be at rank four Half-God level as soon as Feng Ling stepped out, the same cultivation level as her. Based on that, he deduced that this was a martial power formation that adjusted its difficulty to the challenger’s cultivation level.

Watching as Feng Ling clashed with the souls in the martial power formation, Eggy remarked, “That girl is pretty formidable.”

Each of these souls was comparable to a rank four Half-God level cultivator, and there was practically no end to them. These souls were releasing a relentless barrage of attacks on Feng Ling, but the latter was able to subdue them one after another despite them being at the same cultivation level.

“She’s indeed quite powerful,” Chu Feng agreed.

Feng Ling’s combat sense was so sharp that he didn’t have absolute confidence that he would be able to beat her.

“Why isn’t she using any martial skills?” Eggy asked.

“A restriction was probably imposed on her,” Chu Feng said.

Using a weapon and powerful martial skills could have greatly enhanced Feng Ling’s fighting prowess, allowing her to better subdue her opponent. Some time had already passed since she stepped out of the protective formation, and she was starting to struggle against her enemies due to exhaustion, but she still didn’t draw a weapon or resort to her martial skills.

This hinted that some kind of force might be restraining her.

“As formidable as she is, she won’t last long at this rate,” Eggy remarked.

Feng Ling’s fighting prowess had already started to plummet, but there was still no end to the souls in the martial power formation. At this rate, it was only before Feng Ling fell in defeat.

“Chu Feng, what do you plan to do? Are you going to step in and help her, or take this opportunity to eliminate a potential rival?” Eggy asked.

“I don’t think I can leave her to the lurch,” Chu Feng said.

“Why?” Eggy asked.

“I don’t have any concrete evidence, but I don’t think that this remnant’s master is fond of those who betray their comrade,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s possible. That woman did set a test to see if you would save that young man earlier. However, this might come back to bite you. That woman is no pushover, and she can potentially become your rival here,” Eggy said.

“That’s something to consider later. We need to solve this problem first.”

While Chu Feng had decided to help Feng Ling, he chose to first examine the situation before intervening.

“Young master Chu Feng, I need your help!” Feng Ling finally requested help.

Realizing that she was near her limit, she tried retreating to the safety of the protective formation, only to find that her path back to the spirit formation gate was covered with enemies. She wouldn’t be able to make her journey back in her current state.

It was at this crucial moment that Chu Feng made his move. He drew his Immemorial Hero’s Sword and stepped into the spirit formation gate.

The martial power formation adjusted to him right away. Swords appeared in the hands of the souls charging at him, but their cultivation levels plummeted from rank four Half-God level to rank one Half-God level. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It was just as Chu Feng had thought.

These souls were part of a martial power formation that adjusted its difficulty in accordance with its challengers. For instance, his decision to draw the Immemorial Hero’s Sword before entering the spirit formation gate resulted in the souls charging at him being equipped with a weapon too, thus canceling out any advantage he had.

However, it was only the souls that were going after him that had changed to rank one Half-God level. Those attacking Feng Ling were still at rank four Half-God level.

Chu Feng brandished his sword, and the soul around him dissipated with a flash of cold light. More souls rushed in to take the place of their deceased comrades, but he was able to keep them at bay by continuously swinging his sword.

That thinned the souls’ encirclement of Feng Ling, giving her an opportunity to force her way over to the spirit formation gate, where Chu Feng was. Her approach caused the rank one Half-God level souls around Chu Feng to slowly strengthen to rank four Half-God level.

“Young master Chu Feng, there are too many enemies here. Let’s return to the protective formation first,” Feng Ling said before rushing through the spirit formation gate.

To her astonishment, Chu Feng didn’t come along with her. He could have easily turned around and returned to the protective formation, but instead, he began charging into the depths of the martial power formation.

With Feng Ling’s departure, the souls in the martial power formation were all readjusted to rank one Half-God level. None of them were strong enough to stand in Chu Feng’s way, and he was easily able to create a path forward.

However, Feng Ling’s eyes filled with worry. “Is that fellow out of his mind?”

It was just moments ago that she had experienced the horrors of the martial power formation. Those souls weren’t particularly strong, but there was no end to them. No matter how powerful Chu Feng was, it was only a matter of time before he was run down by them.

She had nearly lost her life just by venturing a little deeper!

Chu Feng should have seen the difficulties she had faced inside the martial formation, but he still obstinately chose to fly deeper than she did. He was practically courting his own death!

Woo!

Piercing howls echoed outside the pedestal.

All of the souls cried at the same time as their bodies began to dissipate. The powerful martial power formation was swiftly unraveling!
