Chapter 5094: The Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s Identity

In the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, Chu Feng had freed all of those cultivators who had been imprisoned by Sima Xiangtu. It didn’t take long for the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to revert back to its original state.

Xian Miaomiao’s mother was freed. The Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief was still unconscious since he had suffered quite a bit of torture. It would take him a while before he regained consciousness.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was standing in the sky of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, looking upon his surroundings with a conflicted feeling in his heart. He still remembered how much he hated the Nine Souls Sacred Clan when he first learned about the mishap that had befallen Xian Miaomiao. In fact, he even considered destroying the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

But after everything that had happened, his anger had mostly disappeared. At the very least, he didn’t intend to make things difficult for the Nine Souls Sacred Clan anymore.

Of course, if Xian Miaomiao wanted to exact vengeance on the Nine Souls Sacred Clan after being freed from Princess Xiaoxiao’s body, Chu Feng would help her.

With the rapid advancement in his spirit power, he had already learned of a method to free Xian Miaomiao from Princess Xiaoxiao, just that he needed a lot of materials for it. He chose to hand over the material list to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan as an opportunity for them to make up for their mistake.

How could those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan possibly dare to offend Chu Feng after witnessing what he was capable of? They immediately started gathering the materials.

“Look, it’s Lord Chu Feng!”

“Lord Chu Feng, Lord Chu Feng!”

Resounding cheers started echoing from all around. Those voices were loud and filled with admiration. There were even some who kneeled down and kowtowed deeply toward Chu Feng.

These were all of the cultivators who had been previously trapped by Sima Xiangtu. They had been loitering around the Nine Souls Sacred Clan because they wanted to express their gratitude toward Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s heroic deed had imprinted deeply in their hearts.

However, Chu Feng only felt sorrowful upon seeing all these. He had saved so many people, but he failed to save the single person he wanted to save.

He looked at the starry night sky above him and solemnly prayed that his master would survive being in Sima Xiangtu’s clutches. At the same time, he thought about everything that had happened thus far.

Far too many things had happened over the last few days that it felt like it had all been a dream.

“I remember it now.”

Chu Feng suddenly thought of something and took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. When his eyes fell upon the treasure, he became more certain of his deduction.

He had felt a sense of familiarity from the barrier and the puppets back when he was at the Monstrous Spirit Clan, but he couldn’t figure out where this sense of familiarity was coming from. It was actually from the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

“Could it be that the lord worshiped by the Monstrous Spirit Clan is related to the Celestial Master’s Sacred Clan?”

Chu Feng thought that there must be some kind of relationship between the two.

Weng!

A brilliant white light suddenly enveloped the night sky, lighting up the world as if a new day had come. Soon after, the earth started shaking.

Boom!

A piercing explosion ensued, rattling the entire world.

“Oh my lord, what in the world is going on here?”

All of the cultivators were horrified by the extent of the shaking. It felt as if the world was coming to an end.

Innumerable figures quickly rose from the ground and headed toward Chu Feng’s side, whether they were on close terms with Chu Feng or not. They realized that a terrifying power had emerged in the world, and Chu Feng was the only one who could give them a sense of security.

However, the truth was that even Chu Feng felt uneasy too.

It was fortunate that the light didn’t last for too long before it dissipated, and the shaking soon alleviated too. Everything reverted back to normal as if it was all their imagination.

“What was that?”

Chu Feng looked at the night sky, hoping to figure out the source of the light. The crowd did the same too.

“It has disappeared,” Princess Xiaoxiao suddenly remarked.

Everyone could see that the light had disappeared, so no one paid any heed to her words. However, Princess Xiaoxiao headed over to Chu Feng’s side and pointed toward the place where the light had initially appeared from.

“Chu Feng, there used to be a realm there, but it vanished after the light,” Princess Xiaoxiao elaborated.

“Ah?!”

The crowd was astonished upon hearing that, especially those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. They had been living here from a young age, and many of them had the experience of counting the stars in the sky. These stars were actually realms from both within the Nine Souls Galaxy and beyond.

Not all realms were recognizable to them, but they were at least able to identify the closer ones.

Thus, they could tell that Princess Xiaoxiao was right; one of the realms had disappeared. It was the Nine Souls Galaxy’s Fogtree Lower Realm.

“What could have happened?”

“Fogtree Lower Realm really vanished!!!”

…

Sima Xiangtu was still standing in the same place as before, but his face was covered in fear like never before. Despite not having moved a step, the ground beneath his feet had vanished without a trace. He was in space.

The fragmented bits all around him made one thing clear to him: the world he was in earlier had been destroyed.

“What are you zoning out for, Xiangtu?” a voice sounded.

Sima Xiangtu turned around and saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. The latter held a tattered corpse in his hand. Needless to say, the tattered corpse was Shentu Haoting.

“You… did this?” Sima Xiangtu asked.

“Who else could it be?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied mockingly.

“I’m referring to the Fogtree Lower Realm,” Sima Xiangtu added.

“Ah. I accidentally used too much force. It isn’t that bad since there aren’t many cultivators there,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“W-what kind of monster are you?” Sima Xiangtu’s voice was trembling.

“Me? I can tell you if you really wish to know,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said with a smile.

He took out a Cosmos Sack and flung it to the side. A person fell out from within.

It was the Wretched Black Demon.

There were no wounds on the Wretched Black Demon, but his face was pale and his eyes looked vacuous. His body wouldn’t stop trembling, and he couldn’t utter a word at all. He seemed to be in a traumatized state.

The Wretched Black Demon had tried to steal the Zhuge Clan’s treasure under Sima Xiangtu’s order, but Zhuge Feiluan managed to slip away under his eyelid with the treasure. He managed to capture the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief alive though, so Sima Xiangtu told him to force Zhuge Feiluan out by using the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief as a hostage.

The Wretched Black Demon promised to capture Zhuge Feiluan, but he vanished into thin air since then.

Sima Xiangtu thought that the Wretched Black Demon had betrayed him, but it turned out that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had captured him. He was certain that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been inside his confinement formation all this while, so when did the latter do it?

Sima Xiangtu soon shook his head with a bitter smile.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was able to easily destroy a realm and even nab a legendary figure like Shentu Haoting, so how difficult could it be for him to nab the Wretched Black Demon without him knowing?

“Why did you capture him? Is it because he offended Chu Feng?” Sima Xiangtu asked.

He knew that he was already a goner, so he simply wanted to clarify the doubts lingering in his heart now.

“It’s not because of Chu Feng. I simply didn’t wish to see the destruction of the Zhuge Clan,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“You’re acquainted with the Zhuge Clan?” Sima Xiangtu asked in surprise.

“Of course. The treasure you were hoping to obtain from the Zhuge Clan was something I left them with,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“You’re lying. I know that the Zhuge Clan obtained the treasure from Zhuge Guangyao… Wait a moment, could it be?!”

Sima Xiangtu was initially doubtful of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words, but he suddenly realized something.

“You are Zhuge Guangyao?” he exclaimed. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhuge Guangyao was the most powerful world spiritist that had ever appeared in the Zhuge Clan. He was the one who brought the Zhuge Clan to the peak of its height. It was just that Zhuge Guangyao had already died for many years, so how could the Ox-nosed Old Daoist be him?

In the first place, their ages weren’t right. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was around the same age as him, which made Zhuge Guangyao much older than him.

Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist reacted nonchalantly to the deduction.

“I did spend a lifetime under the alias of Zhuge Guangyao, but that isn’t my real name. What’s my real name again? It has been far too long, and I have used too many names since then. I’ll have to think for a while.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist started thinking hard.

Meanwhile, Sima Xiangtu looked at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with eyes filled with fear. He realized that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist wasn’t from the same generation as him but an old monster who had lived through the ages.

Even Zhuge Guangyao was nothing more than an identity he had assumed.

“Ah, I remember. The very first name should be Dugu Lingtian,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.
