MGA: Chapter 1258 - Bai Suyan’s Strength

“A grand management elder of the Cyanwood Mountain’s Punishment Department, is this bit of skill all that you possess?”

After Bai Suyan blocked that management elder’s attack, a light smile emerged on her face. Her smile was filled with disdain and mockery.

As for that management elder, his expression turned ugly. He was no fool; from Bai Suyan’s previous counterattack, he was able to tell that she was most definitely not someone simple. At the very least, she greatly surpassed his imagination.

He had truly underestimated his opponent this time around and encountered a troublesome character.

Yet, he had already accepted Crazed Killer Tuoba’s orders and said that he would eliminate Bai Suyan, Chu Feng and the others.

If he were to retreat now and allow Bai Suyan and the others to leave, he would most definitely be punished upon his return.

Thinking till this point, the management elder clenched his teeth and a ruthless light flashed through his eyes. With one hand, he began to form hand seals. Then he snarled, and a layer of blue gaseous substance began to emerge from his body.

That gaseous substance appeared like a vapor as it drifted out from his body. It then distorted the surrounding space and began to revolve around him.

Following the appearance of that gaseous substance, the Punishment Department management elder’s skin also started to turn blue in color.

Furthermore, the change was not only limited to his skin; his body also started to slightly change. At this moment, his body appeared like steel and gave off an indestructible sensation.

Most importantly, his current aura was several times stronger than before, and his battle power have been greatly increased.

“Forbidden Mysterious Technique?” Bai Suyan managed to determine what her opponent was doing.

“This is a Forbidden Mysterious Technique?” After hearing what Bai Suyan said, Chu Feng and the others were also startled. Even though they knew that Forbidden Mysterious Techniques were powerful, it was the first time they had ever seen someone able to use a Forbidden Mysterious Technique to such a powerful degree, comparable to that of a Divine Body.

“Woosh.” However, at the moment when Chu Feng and the others were startled, that Punishment Department’s management elder flipped his wrist, and a palm-sized blue colored bowl appeared in his hand.

At this moment, runes and symbols were circulating through that bowl, causing it to flicker with light. In the moment when that bowl appeared, the Punishment Department management elder’s battle power actually increased again.

It turned out that was no ordinary bowl, it was actually a top quality Royal Armament.

With a wave of his sleeve, the management elder actually threw that Royal Armament into the air.

Once that Royal Armament bowl was tossed into the air, the light on it immediately increased by many times. A strange blue-colored light, along with countless symbols and runes, shone in the sky like the sun, illuminating everything below it.

That light actually contained an extremely destructive power. Whenever it passed, even space actually began to shatter and then melt; the space was actually being refined by the light.

“What sort of power is that?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“That is a Half Martial Emperor, the existence closest to Martial Emperors.”

At this moment, even Chu Feng was unable to contain himself from sucking in a mouthful of cold air. An expression of shock appeared on his previously calm and determined face.

He was able to tell that the attack that the management elder used was a Taboo Martial Skill. That Punishment Elder had combined the forces of a Forbidden Mysterious Technique, a Taboo Martial Skill and a top quality Royal Armament to attack.

As for that attack, it was truly powerful, and capable of easily destroying a region, instantly killing all of the people in that place.

In fact, it was not only Chu Feng that was startled. Both Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying were even more shocked than Chu Feng. Merely, when compared to Chu Feng, they were so shocked that they did not even have the time to gasp. By the time they managed to react, their faces were already covered with fear.

“Woosh.”

Right at this moment, a gale appeared before the three of them. Bai Suyan had already leaped higher into the air. Like a sharp arrow, she rushed to the blue light in the sky.

Her speed was extremely fast. By the time Chu Feng and the others noticed that she had moved, she had already reached the blue light.

“Boom~~~~”

Suddenly, a loud explosion sounded in the sky. At the same time, that strange blue light stopped expanding and actually started to dissipate.

In the blink of an eye, the blue light completely disappeared. At the same time, a beautiful figure appeared before Chu Feng and the others.

It was Bai Suyan. She was standing in the sky with her red skirt fluttering in the air. She was so stunningly beautiful.

However, the matter that was the most amazing was that there was an item in her lily-white hand. It was actually that Punishment Department management elder’s bowl-shaped Royal Armament.

“It would seem that your strength is only at this level. Truly a disappointment.”

Bai Suyan shook her head in a disappointed manner. After that, she lightly clenched her hand and several rays of light began to spiral forth like little snakes, flowing into the bowl.

“Puu~~~~”

Once the light entered the bowl, the Punishment Department’s management elder immediately vomited a mouthful of aged blood, covered his chest with his hand and half knelt in the air.

In merely an instant, his aged face grew much paler. It was as if he had aged tens of years in an instant. Even his aura became much weaker. It was as if something very important in his body had been removed.

“So powerful,” When he saw Bai Suyan’s strength, Chu Feng was shocked from the bottom of his heart.

That blue-colored bowl was a Royal Armament that recognized its master. Yet, at this moment, the connection between that Royal Armament and the Punishment Department’s elder had been forcibly cut off by Bai Suyan. This was why that Punishment Department’s management elder vomited a mouthful of blood and sustained major injury to his life force.

“Who, who, who exactly are you?”

After being seriously injured, that Punishment Department’s management elder no longer had the confidence he had before. Instead, all of his confidence was replaced with shock and a deep sense of unease. The gaze with which he looked at Bai Suyan was filled with fear.

As matters stood, he finally realized that Bai Suyan was extraordinary, that the damned bitch was actually an unfathomable and frightening existence.

“Who I am is not important. What is important is that you actually dared to come assassinate me. With that, you are destined to encounter a great calamity.”

Bai Suyan slowly walked toward the Punishment Department’s management elder. She arrived in front of him, raised her lily-white hand and lightly placed it on top of the Punishment Department management elder’s head.

“What, what, what are you planning to do?”

“I am a management elder of the Cyanwood Mountain’s Punishment Department. If you dare to do anything to me, the Cyanwood Mountain will definitely not let you get away with it.”

At this moment, that Punishment Department’s management elder had completely lost his calm. Even his aged body began to shiver violently.

“Do you truly think your Cyanwood Mountain is all that? It’s nothing more than one of the Nine Powers. Do you truly think that it’s invincible?”

“To the ignorant, they might think that you all are one of the apex powers in the Holy Land of Martialism. However, before the true experts, the Nine Powers are nothing more than a bunch of second-rate powers.”

Bai Suyan smiled disdainfully. She completely disregarded the Punishment Department management elder’s threat. After that, a flash of coldness shone past her eyes. She suddenly spread her hand that was on that Punishment Department management elder’s head and grabbed it. After that, a very frantic suction began to emit from her palm, covering that Punishment Department management elder’s entire body.

“Eeeahhhh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~”

In an instant, a scream that sounded like the howling of wolves and the wailing of ghosts resounded throughout the entire region. Even the space around them was being violently distorted by the voice from that Half Martial Emperor. The distant mountains and rivers started to collapse and the earth began to shatter. Countless birds soared into the sky, and countless creatures fled from that scream.

However, compared to these, Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying were all stunned speechless.

That was because, at this very moment, that Punishment Department’s management elder’s cultivation and source energy were leaving his body following that suction energy. They were being absorbed by Bai Suyan.

Not only did Bai Suyan absorb that Punishment Department’s management elder’s source energy, she was even absorbing his cultivation. This sort of method was extremely frightening.
