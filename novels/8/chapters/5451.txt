Chapter 5451: Do You Finally Know Who I Am Now?

Long Rui kneeled on the floor, trembling nonstop.

Jia Lingyi was petrified. Her arrogance vanished without a trace. Her face went completely pale from fright.

The same went for the others from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect too. As if the apocalypse had befallen them, none of them dared to breathe loudly out of fear that it would spell their death. They knew that they had crossed the wrong person today.

That was how influential Long Muxi was.

“Jia Lingyi, didn’t you say that I’d have to pay the price for siding with Chu Feng? Do you know what kind of price you have to pay for slapping me earlier then?” Long Muxi asked Jia Lingyi.

Jia Lingyi fell silent. She gulped down a mouthful of saliva as her complexion turned increasingly worse.

“What happened, Jia Lingyi?” Long Rui suddenly roared.

He knew about the grudge between Jia Lingyi and Chu Feng, but he didn’t know that there was something between her and Long Muxi too. It was clear that something was off from what Long Muxi had just said.

“Lord Long Rui, I didn’t know this lady is the Totem Dragon Clan’s Miss Muxi! She kidnapped my son and declared that she would help Chu Feng deal with me, so I gave her a slap,” Jia Lingyi confessed the truth.

“You actually struck Miss Muxi… Are you out of your mind?!”

Long Rui was shocked beyond words. As a member of the Totem Dragon Clan, he knew how much the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief doted on Long Muxi. Putting aside Jia Lingyi, there was hardly anyone inside the Totem Dragon Clan who would dare touch Long Muxi!

“What are you standing in a daze for? Kowtow and admit your mistakes to Miss Muxi! Snap off whatever hand you used to strike her!” Long Rui angrily ordered.

However, Jia Lingyi didn’t do as she was told. Rather, her eyes glowed with a dangerous glint upon hearing those words. Her air changed as she made her decision. Her fear remained, but she wasn’t flustered any longer.

She turned to Long Rui and said, “Lord Long Rui, you know nothing about my relationship with Miss Muxi and Chu Feng. She was after me right from the start. She kidnapped my son to lure me here. It doesn’t matter whether I apologize or not; she doesn’t intend to let me off. My fate is sealed. But Lord Long Rui, your young miss is on close terms with Chu Feng, and she now knows that you are in cahoots with me. Do you know what that means?”

“Stop spouting nonsense, Jia Lingyi! When have I ever been in cahoots with you?” Long Rui hurriedly drew a line between him and Jia Lingyi before subserviently turning to Long Muxi. “Miss Muxi, don’t listen to that woman’s words. I don’t have any private ties with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect! I only retracted the protective formation because Chu Feng has clearly done wrong by killing the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. I was foolish for not getting to the bottom of the matter. I never should have trusted Jia Lingyi so much…”

“Enough!”

Shockingly, it was not Long Muxi but Jia Lingyi who interrupted Long Rui with a roar.

Shoosh!

Jia Lingyi’s hand shot forth to grab Long Muxi’s neck.

Everyone, including those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, was taken aback. Was Jia Lingyi out of her mind? How could she make a move on Long Muxi after learning of the latter’s identity?

“What are you doing, Jia Lingyi?!” Long Rui roared.

“Lord Long Rui, do you still not get it? Your young miss is on close terms with Chu Feng! Begging for mercy and explaining yourself won’t work here. There’s only one way for us to survive, and that’s to ensure that no one learns about what happens here!” Jia Lingyi exclaimed while clutching Long Muxi’s neck.

The faces of everyone except for those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect turned pale. It was clear that Jia Lingyi was planning to kill all of them. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Lord Long Rui, I’ll be the one to carry out this task. All you have to do is to feign ignorance!” Jia Lingyi said.

“Long Rui, I won’t pursue this matter today. If I die, you are to report this matter to my father and have the entire Pill Dao Immortal Sect destroyed!” Long Muxi said.

She knew that the reason Jia Lingyi hadn’t made a move on her yet was that she was waiting for Long Rui’s answer. If Long Rui refused to collude with her, the ones to suffer were not just Jia Lingyi but the entire Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

The Pill Dao Immortal Sect might still get away with offending the princess of the Totem Dragon Clan, but there was no way the Totem Dragon Clan would spare them if they killed Long Muxi.

“Trust me, Lord Long Rui. You’ll be safe as long as this matter is kept under wraps. If you spare Long Muxi right now, the two of us will be doomed. It won’t be just you but your kin as well!” Jia Lingyi exclaimed.

“Long Rui, don’t listen to her. You know what kind of person I, Long Muxi, am. I have given you my word,” Long Muxi said.

Even though Long Rui wasn’t here, he was the key to deciding whether she and Chu Feng could survive this crisis. Jia Lingyi wouldn’t dare to make a move as long as Long Rui decided to back them.

“Heh…”

Long Rui suddenly smiled. His disposition suddenly changed altogether.

Chu Feng immediately understood what Long Rui’s decision was. He glanced at the All Lives Are Equal palace with a hint of anxiety in his eyes.

“Miss Muxi, Lord Suqing isn’t with you, right?” The subservience in Long Rui’s voice had vanished without a trace.

“My aunt is here,” Long Muxi replied.

“Miss Muxi, look at the state you are in. How could Lord Suqing allow you to suffer like this?”

“What do you mean by this, Long Rui? Are you staging a rebellion now?”

“Miss Muxi, I don’t wish to stage a rebellion. I just want to survive.”

“Audacious, Long Rui! My aunt is in Painter Mountain right now! She’s just… Wu…”

Before Long Muxi could finish her words, Jia Lingyi had already tightened her grasp on her throat to stop her from talking.

“Lord Long Rui, we can’t turn back anymore. Issue your order. I’ll end this as soon as you give your word,” Jia Lingyi said.

“Jia Lingyi, your grudge against me has nothing to do with Miss Bai. Come at me instead,” Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.

“Calm down, Chu Feng. You’re next. I won’t let you die an easy death,” Jia Lingyi sneered before turning her attention back to Long Muxi. “Long Muxi, I knew from the start that you were from the Totem Dragon Clan, but I didn’t think that you would be Long Muxi. But so what if you are Long Muxi? You’re still going to die in my hands anyway.”

Killing intent flared in Jia Lingyi’s eyes.

Pu!

Fresh blood suddenly spurted all over the air. The crowd was stunned.

Long Muxi remained completely unharmed. Jia Lingyi’s hand was still clutching onto her neck, but the hand had been severed from the body. Someone had sliced off Jia Lingyi’s arm!

Jia Lingyi stared at her broken arm with a look of absolute horror. She knew right away that things had gone horribly wrong.

“The audacity of you, Long Rui!” an old voice echoed.

A powerful oppressive might enveloped the area, shattering Jia Lingyi’s formation while binding everyone from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, including Jia Lingyi. The crowd quickly looked toward where the voice was coming from, and their eyes widened in shock.

In particular, the faces of Jia Lingyi, Long Rui, and the others crumbled in despair.

It was a pair of an old and a young man.

The old man was built like a hill, boasting a brawny physique that towered at a height of over thirty meters. His presence was imposing.

However, Chu Feng was much more surprised to see the young man beside him.

“That’s Lord Long Kui of the Dragon Flags Nine Warriors!”

“The Totem Dragon Clan’s young master, Long Chengyu!”

“We’re saved! We’re saved!”

Cheers filled the surroundings. The crowd who thought that they were doomed was filled with relief when they saw those two figures.

Long Chengyu flitted over to Long Muxi’s side and concernedly asked, “Big sister, are you fine?”

Long Muxi tossed away the broken hand clutching onto her neck, but she didn’t respond to Long Chengyu’s words of concern. Rather, she maintained her cold attitude.

Long Chengyu didn’t pay it any heed and instead glared at Jia Lingyi, spewing, “You wench! How dare you harm my big sister!”

He whipped out a dagger in preparation to take Jia Lingyi’s life.

“Stop!” Long Muxi suddenly spoke up.

Long Chengyu looked at Long Muxi in confusion.

“Leave her to Chu Feng,” Long Muxi ordered.

Long Chengyu was surprised, but he held back on killing Jia Lingyi. Instead, he turned around and began walking toward Chu Feng with a grim look.

The crowd felt worried for Chu Feng.

Long Chengyu was the young master of the Totem Dragon Clan. His influence was far greater than the elusive Long Muxi. The crowd thought that he was going to blame Chu Feng for this incident since Long Muxi nearly lost her life trying to help him.

No matter how strong Chu Feng was, there was no way he stood a chance against Long Chengyu, both in terms of cultivation and background.

But just as everyone thought that Chu Feng was going to suffer a horrible fate, Long Chengyu suddenly patted Chu Feng’s shoulder and flashed a brilliant grin.

“Heh! Brother, do you finally know who I am now?”
