Chapter 4294 - Do Not Court Death

“Chu Feng?”

Xianhai Gusu and Xianhai Xin’er were surprised to hear Chu Feng’s name. But, they were soon able to understand why Xianhai Shaoyu said Chu Feng.

After all, both of them knew that while the black case was very powerful, it was something that concerned one’s talent.

The two of them both acknowledged Chu Feng’s talent.

“While Chu Feng’s current cultivation is still lacking, his talent is beyond measure.”

“Opening this artifact required talent. Furthermore, people could take it on together.”

“If I encounter dangers trying to open it myself, Chu Feng will be able to help me shoulder that danger.”

“But, Chu Feng must be called to my help the moment I encounter danger to my life. Else, we wouldn’t be able to make it in time to save me,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Lord young master, would I be able to share the burden if I enter it?” asked Xianhai Xin’er.

“Xin’er, you are definitely talented. But, your talent would not be enough to open this item.”

“As such, you should not accompany me.”

“It will be too dangerous for you,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Young master, why don’t you have Chu Feng open that case together with you from the start?” asked Xianhai Xin’er.

“My purpose is to challenge myself.”

“If I have Chu Feng share the burden from the start, it would be completely meaningless.”

“Asking for Chu Feng’s help would be if I had no alternative. Personally, I do not wish for that to happen.”

“But... I also do not wish to die trying to challenge this thing. Thus, it is better to be prepared than sorry,” said Xianhai Shaoyu with a smile.

“Oh, that’s right. If you are to seek out Chu Feng’s help, you must inform him how dangerous this case is. You cannot deceive him to make him enter it,” Xianhai Shaoyu said to Lady Gusu.

The meaning behind those words were very clear.

He wanted Chu Feng to know that he might end up losing his life challenging that case.

He wanted to give Chu Feng the choice as to whether or not to enter the case.

If Chu Feng refused to enter, Xianhai Gusu was not to force him.

“Senior Gusu, you must promise me that you will not force Chu Feng if he’s unwilling,” emphasized Xianhai Shaoyu.

The reason why he deliberately said that was because he understood Xianhai Gusu’s personality.

He knew that Xianhai Gusu would be capable of doing anything for the sake of his safety.

If Chu Feng didn’t go in to help him voluntarily, it would be of no use even if he went in.

“This subordinate understands.”

Lady Gusu accepted Xianhai Shaoyu’s request.

She knew what he was thinking.

“But young master, if Lady Gusu is to go and seek for Chu Feng’s help, wouldn’t we end up exposing our identities?” asked Xianhai Xin’er.

“If things come to that...”

As he said those words, Xianhai Shaoyu looked to Lady Gusu.

“Senior Gusu, you don’t have to explain anything to Chu Feng. I will personally explain things to him myself,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

Then, Xianhai Shaoyu began to forcibly open the black case.

The method he used was very special.

He was using various special treasures.

As the opening of the black case will cause a massive commotion, he needed to shift that commotion to the Outer World.

He cannot allow for that commotion to occur on the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

After all, he already knew that there were many powerful creatures hidden in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

For example, there was that terrifying existence that covered the entire sky.

If he ended up luring that existence over here, he wouldn’t know if it would be a blessing or a disaster.

After all, before their own interests, cultivators... would oftentimes reveal their greed.

Shifting such a massive commotion to the Outer World was an impossible task for Xianhai Shaoyu if he was to utilize his own strength.

That was why he needed to borrow the strength of powerful treasures.

After some time, the black case finally successfully opened.

But, neither Xianhai Gusu or Xianhai Xin’er knew what the opened case looked like.

The reason for that was because only a spirit formation gate remained after the black case opened.

Only by entering that spirit formation gate would one know how powerful the black case was.

But, Xianhai Shaoyu did not permit Xianhai Xin’er to follow him inside.

Furthermore, as there was an age restriction, Lady Gusu was unable to enter either.

But, that black case’s spirit formation gate appeared extremely terrifying.

Merely seeing that spirit formation gate brought them great unease.

This made Xianhai Gusu and Xianhai Xin’er extremely worried.

“Xin’er, take this.”

“If the situation turns bad, enter it immediately and help Lord young master withstand that power.”

“Remember, you cannot wait until the time when Lord young master is in fatal dager to eter. If there’s any sign of danger, you are to enter immediately.”

Xianhai Gusu handed Xianhai Shaoyu’s Life Talisman paper to Xianhai Xin’er.

“Lady Gusu, where are you going?” asked Xianhai Xin’er.

But, she actually already had a guess. She was asking a question she already knew the answer to.

“Naturally to find Chu Feng,” said Xianhai Gusu.

“But Lady Gusu, young master said that we cannot seek out Chu Feng unless there’s no other alternative,” said Xianhai Xin’er.

“Silly girl. Is young master’s life more important or are those rules more important?” said Xianhai Gusu.

“Xin’er understands.”

Xianhai Xin’er reached terms. She too felt that Xianhai Shaoyu’s life was more important.

Even though they will be going against his order, they would at most be punished.

Furthermore, Xianhai Shaoyu, with her personality, rarely punishes others. At most he would only scold them.

But, if they were to follow his rules and ended up killing him, not only will their Lord Clan Chief blame them, they will not be able to forgive themselves either. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Xin’er, remember this. If there’s any sign of fluctuation with young master’s life, you are to enter right away.”

“You absolutely cannot delay.”

Xianhai Gusu reemphasized sternly.

“Lady Gusu, please rest assured. Xin’er will definitely act accordingly,” ensured Xianhai Xin’er.

Then, Xianhai Gusu entered the Seven Suns Mountain Range to seek out Chu Feng.

The protective formation around the Seven Suns Mountain Range was personally set up by Grandmaster Tang Chen.

But, even Grandmaster Tang Chen’s spirit formation was unable to stop Xianhai Gusu.

Currently, Chu Feng was inside a forbidden region of the Seven Suns Mountain Range. Together with him were Grandmaster Tang Chen, Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting.

Suddenly, a figure landed in this forbidden region.

Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu were immediately alerted.

And, upon seeing who it was that arrived, even Chu Feng revealed a shocked look.

“Senior, it’s you?”

“But why would you...”

Seeing Xianhai Gusu who appeared all of a sudden, Chu Feng was extremely surprised.

As he doesn’t know the truth, he still thought her to be Shaoyu and Xin’er’s grandmother.

According to his knowledge, this senior shouldn’t appear in this place.

“Chu Feng, Shaoyu is in trouble. I need your help.”

Xianhai Gusu immediately grabbed Chu Feng and was about to bring him away.

“Halt! Who are you?!”

Grandmaster Tang Chen immediately unleashed his oppressive might to stop her.

After all, he doesn’t know who Xianhai Gusu was. He couldn’t allow for a strange to forcibly bring Chu Feng away.

“Do not court death!”

Once Grandmaster Tang Chen unleashed his oppressive might, Xianhai Gusu’s gaze turned cold.

She merely took a glance at Grandmaster Tang Chen before his complexion turned deathly pale. As if petrified, he stood completely frozen.

Even though Xianhai Gusu did not unleash her oppressive might at all, her gaze was enough to completely crumble Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Merely from a single gaze, Grandmaster Tang Chen realized that there was an enormous disparity between their strength.

At the instant he was frozen in place, Xianhai Gusu disappeared with Chu Feng.
