Chapter 4875: Advice

Everyone’s eyes locked onto the elder standing behind Shengguang Xuanye, and the entire world fell silent.

The crowd chose to keep their mouths tightly shut, not daring to let out a squeak at all.

There were even some elders who feared that their juniors would be unable to read the atmosphere, so they clasped their hands around their juniors’ mouths to stop them from saying anything.

They could all sense the elder possessed terrifying strength that surpassed that of Shengguang Xuanye. Even the lightning beast in the sky was suppressed by him.

It was as if he had become the ruler of this land.

Even if he wasn’t at the pinnacle of Martial Exalted level yet, it was likely that he had already reached rank eight Martial Exalted level at the very minimum, or else he wouldn’t have been so overwhelmingly powerful.

That was a level that countless people dreamed of reaching!

But even powerhouses like the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and the Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s sectmaster would likely never reach such a height in their lifetime, let alone the others.

They wouldn’t even dare speak up in front of such a figure, let alone offend him. Just a single wrong word could very well plunge their respective powers into a calamity.

“Is this the Holy Valley they spoke of? Why have we never heard of it before?”

“Is there some sort of connection between the Holy Valley and the Holy Light Clan?”

This was the first time that the crowd was hearing of the power named Holy Valley. Earlier, Daoist Niantian was able to instill deep fear into Shengguang Xuanye just by revealing his Holy Valley token, and now, someone from the Holy Valley had made his appearance.

The result didn’t disappoint. The Holy Valley was as powerful as the crowd imagined it to be.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng opened his left hand, releasing a blinding light that swiftly enveloped the land.

At the same time, a formation emerged from the light. It was a teleportation formation.

Chu Feng was confident that he could defeat Shengguang Xuanye with the Second Slash, but to be safe, he still prepared a teleportation formation in case he needed to escape.

“This is bad!”

But as soon as he activated the teleportation formation, he knew that things had gone awry.

The teleportation formation should have brought him out right away, but he still remained where he was despite having activated it. This meant that the teleportation had failed.

“Why are you in such a rush to leave when you’re already here?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The white-browed elder from the Holy Valley smiled at Chu Feng, but it was clear that it was a smile filled with sinister intention.

“You were the one who stopped the formation?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why ask the obvious? Shengguang Xuanye is protected by our Holy Valley. Your act of challenging Shengguang Xuanye is equivalent to insulting us!” the white-browed elder said.

It was clear to everyone that Chu Feng had landed himself in a bad spot.

“Lord Baimei, young friend Chu Feng doesn’t know that the Holy Valley is backing the Holy Light Clan. The ignorant shouldn’t be blamed for their misdeeds. Shouldn’t we discuss this matter carefully?”

A figure suddenly appeared beside Chu Feng. It was Daoist Niantian.

“Niantian, you might be an honorary elder of our Holy Valley, but I advise you not to meddle too much in our affairs,” the white-browed elder replied.

Tzlala!

The lightning in the sky started to dissipate.

“Chu Feng!!!”

Following that, a silhouette suddenly rushed toward Chu Feng’s side.

“Hmph!”

The white-browed elder waved his sleeves, and a surge of power rushed toward the person approaching Chu Feng. The surge of power caused the person’s clothes and appearance to morph, revealing an unexpected person beneath the disguise.

“Princess Xiaoxiao?!”

The crowd could recognize right away that it was Long Xiaoxiao. They didn’t expect Long Xiaoxiao to be here too.

“Xiaoxiao.”

As soon as Long Xiaoxiao was curbed by the white-browed elder, another figure quickly rushed toward where Long Xiaoxiao was. It was just that the figure had her disguise stripped off and was forcefully frozen in mid-air too.

She was no other than Long Xiaoxiao’s mother.

“Shengguang Xuanye, I’ll leave things to you here.”

The white-browed elder from the Holy Valley vanished after stopping Long Xiaoxiao and her mother in place. The next moment, he was already standing right beside Chu Feng.

Daoist Niantian was currently treating him.

“How is it? Will he lose his life?” the white-browed elder asked.

“It doesn’t look optimistic,” Daoist Niantian replied.

“It’ll suffice as long as he doesn’t die. He can’t die yet.”

The white-browed elder stretched his hand forth to grab Chu Feng, but Daoist Niantian also grabbed Chu Feng at the same time.

“Niantian, are you really intending to make an enemy out of me?” the white-browed elder asked with a menacing glare.

“Lord Baimei, some words of advice. Don’t threaten Chu Feng’s life.”

It was only after saying those words that he finally released his grip on Chu Feng.

“Heh...”

However, the white-browed elder let out a cold sneer and scoffed, “Niantian, to think that you’re an honorary elder of our Holy Valley. Shouldn’t you know the power of our Holy Valley better tahn anyone else? It’s one thing if our Holy Valley didn’t make an appearance, but now that we have come out of our seclusion, we’ll be the only overlords of the Holy Light Galaxy.

“He’s nothing more than a mere junior, and you’re advising me not to touch him? Are you saying that his background is something that even our Holy Valley needs to tread carefully around?”

In his eyes, Daoist Niantian’s words were nothing more than a joke.

“Lord Baimei, I’ve already said my piece. It’s up to you to decide whether you wish to heed my advice or not,” Daoist Niantian replied.

“It looks like you have gone senile from practicing your world spiritist techniques!”

The white-browed elder sneered coldly before leaving the scene, taking Chu Feng away with him.

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief turned pale upon seeing that Chu Feng had been taken away by the white-browed elder. He had chosen to stand with Chu Feng, but the circumstances clearly showed that Chu Feng had been defeated.

Didn’t this spell a calamity for the Dragon Clan?

Speak of the devil, Shengguang Xuanye directed cold eyes on him the next moment.

“The members of the Dragon Clan have colluded with Chu Feng to betray our Holy Light Galaxy. Men, round up the members of the Dragon Clan!” Shengguang Xuanye spat through gritted teeth.

He had recovered a fair bit, but he was still in a frail condition. While Chu Feng’s First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance failed to kill him, it did inflict considerable damage on him.

Shengguang Xuanye felt incredibly humiliated that he was actually injured by a mere junior, but what was unacceptable was how he nearly lost his life if not for Lord Baimei’ intervention.

And such a sight was witnessed by everyone present.

What would become of his dignity?

Since Chu Feng was taken away by Lord Baimei, it meant that he couldn’t kill Chu Feng himself to exact vengeance. Given so, he could only vent his anger on the Dragon Clan.

It turned out that Shengguang Xuanye wasn’t the only angry one here. The entire Holy Light Clan was infuriated by Chu Feng’s transgression.

The moment he gave his order, the members from the Holy Light Clan drew their weapons and began charging at the members of the Dragon Clan.

“Formation, activate!”

However, Daoist Niantian suddenly let out a bellow. There was a flash of brilliant light right after.

By the time the light vanished, Daoist Niantian, Long Xiaoxiao and her mother, and everyone from the Dragon Clan had disappeared.

“Daoist Niantian, are you intending to betray our Holy Light Galaxy too?!” Shengguang Xuanye roared.

Unexpectedly, he received a response from Daoist Niantian from an immeasurable distance away.

“Lord Xuanye, I’m not doing this to protect the Dragon Clan but your Holy Light Clan. If you really destroyed the Dragon Clan today, not even the Holy Valley will be able to protect you when Chu Feng returns.”
