MGA: Chapter 1671 - Challenge Again

Not only did the connections the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword, the two Incomplete Imperial Armaments, had with Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi been severed, they had also acknowledged Chu Feng.

This was not a simple acknowledgement, the two Incomplete Imperial Armaments had entered absolute submission.

At this moment, with the two Incomplete Imperial Armaments in his hands, Chu Feng was able to clearly sense two streams of energy entering his body.

As this continued, Chu Feng’s cultivation was no longer that of rank one Half Martial Emperor. Instead, he had reached a breakthrough and become a rank two Half Martial Emperor.

“It would seem that I underestimated myself,” Chu Feng laughed at himself.

Earlier, he had been worried that the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword would not acknowledge him. However, now it would seem that his worries were completely unnecessary.

The reason for that was because the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword were extremely urgent to serve him. It was as if they had been waiting for the opportunity to do so.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword started to tremble. This sort of trembling was not the trembling of resistance. Instead, it was as if they were requesting orders from Chu Feng to fight for him.

Sure enough, the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword were extraordinary items. The two of them possessed their own intelligence.

“I know that the two of you have been wronged, to be forced to be used by Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi.”

“Now that the two of you are willing to be used by me, I will definitely not fail to live up to your expectations.”

Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he put away the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword that he was holding in his hands, and his figure suddenly shifted. With a speed akin to a phantom’s, Chu Feng left the cave and arrived outside.

After arriving outside of the cave, Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he placed his hands on his waist and shouted, “The Poison Demon’s descendants are without morals and virtue. They bully and humiliate commoners. As such, they shall be beheaded.”

“All of you, scram out and come over here. Allow me to properly teach you all how to conduct yourselves.”

The Poison Demon’s descendants were all shocked and frightened to hear this shout. That was because this voice was very familiar to them, as it sounded very much like Chu Feng’s voice.

“Heavens, this...”

Upon reaching the entrance and seeing the person standing out there shouting those words, some of the people that came out were so frightened that their legs grew weak, they fell onto their butts and began to piss their pants.

Like Chu Feng? No, this simply was Chu Feng! But, Chu Feng should be in the Poison Refinement Formation, he should be being refined by the Poison Refinement Formation. Why would he be standing before the entrance of their cave completely unscathed?

Thus, they immediately went to call their elders. When Elder Xiuyuan and the others arrived and saw Chu Feng standing outside the cave, they all immediately displayed expressions of shock.

They never would have expected that Chu Feng would truly escape from the Poison Refinement Formation. Furthermore, not only did he escape, he had actually escaped this quickly. They had simply left the Poison Refinement Formation just moments ago. Yet, Chu Feng had also come out from the Poison Refinement Formation right after.

At this moment, the person with the most unsightly expression would naturally be Elder Xiuyuan. In order to guard against Chu Feng escaping from the Poison Refinement Formation, he had specially set up a spirit formation.

However, Chu Feng was already standing before their entrance and challenging them. Yet, he had not detected Chu Feng escaping from his spirit formation at all. As such, how could he possibly accept this? Could it be that his spirit formation was completely useless?

“Stop making a fuss while looking at me. Go and call your Clan Chief out. Don’t tell me you all really plan to make me kill all of you,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

Hearing those words, Elder Xiuyuan and the others did not dare to hesitate. They immediately went to call their Lord Clan Chief Du Wanwu out.

After Du Wanwu came out, he was a lot calmer than Elder Xiuyuan and the others. However, he still had a very shocked expression on his face.

Evidently, even he did not expect that Chu Feng would be able to escape from the Poison Refinement Formation. Not only did he escape, Chu Feng was completely unscathed. In fact, his condition appeared to be even better than before.

“It would appear that I have underestimated you.”

“To be able to stay in the Poison Refinement Formation and escape unscathed, you are the first. You should possess a body immune to poisons, right?” Du Wanwu said.

“Immune to poisons? You are truly overpraising me.”

“I do not think that I possess a body immune to poisons. Merely, it’s just that your poisons do not work on me,” Chu Feng said while smiling beamingly. However, his words were filled with mockery.

The poisons used by the Poison Demon’s descendants were most definitely not ordinary poisons. However, Chu Feng had such a low opinion of their poisons. This was simply an undisguised insult.

“What arrogance! You actually dared to insult our Du Clan. Today, I shall use poison to kill you!”

Du Wanwu shouted coldly. Then, surging green gaseous flames were emitted from his body and swept towards Chu Feng. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

This was no ordinary poison gas. Instead, this was the poison gas that was innate to him. When that green gaseous flame appeared, the sky started to change color, and Du Wanwu’s cultivation instantly increased from rank four Half Martial Emperor to rank five Half Martial Emperor.

In other words, the Divine Power that Du Wanwu possessed was a kind of poison gas. This child was a natural born poison expert.

Furthermore, his poisons were extremely fierce. It could be said that Du Wanwu had used a fatal attack right away. It would appear that Du Wanwu had realized that Chu Feng could not be left alive. Thus, he had the intention to kill Chu Feng in order to prevent future troubles.

However, facing Du Wanwu’s surging poison gas that was capable of refining all living things, Chu Feng stood there without even bothering to dodge or defend.

Earlier, Du Wanwu had defeated him through the use of martial power. However, this time around, Du Wanwu had been provoked by Chu Feng and decided to attack him with only poison gas.

Chu Feng had been fearful of Du Wanwu’s poison gas before. However, after being immersed in the Poison Refinement Formation for a total of twenty days, Chu Feng no longer feared it.

Chu Feng believed in one thing; that it was definitely not a coincidence that he had managed to pass through the Poison Mist Formation unscathed. Likely, the method that the Snow-haired Immortal had used on him was effective.

Right now, Chu Feng did indeed possess a body that was immune to poisons. At the very least, his body was immune to the majority of extremely poisonous things. Even the Poison Demon’s poison and Du Wanwu’s Divine Poison would not be able to affect him.

“Boom~~~”

At this moment, Du Wanwu’s Divine Poison had completely covered Chu Feng in many layers. They were entering through Chu Feng’s body from all of his orifices to corrode and refine his body from within and without.

At this moment, Chu Feng’s surroundings were filled with green poison gas. That poison gas was emitting an extremely stinky odor.

Du Wanwu’s Divine Poison was truly unpleasant to smell. After the surrounding air around Chu Feng was all covered by the poison gas, the unpleasant odor became even more intense.

However, Chu Feng was standing there completely unscathed. Even though the poison gas was violently surging and assailing him, Chu Feng was not affected by the poison gas in the slightest.

“Heh...” Suddenly, Chu Feng laughed. If he had been skeptical that he possessed a body immune to poisons before, then he fully believed it now.

Chu Feng firmly believed that he now possessed a body that was immune to poisons.

“Du Wanwu, your poison is useless against me. No matter how many times you try, the result will be the same.”

“If you wish to kill me, you should use your martial power,” Chu Feng sneered. Then, with a thought, Chu Feng’s Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared.

At the same time, a stream of water shot out from Chu Feng toward Du Wanwu.
