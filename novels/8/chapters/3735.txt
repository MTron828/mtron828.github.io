Chapter 3735 - Rank Five Exalted

It was inevitable that Chu Feng would reminisce about the past with the Four Symbols Divine Beasts.

That said, Chu Feng merely reminisced for a short while. After all, he had an urgent matter that he must take care of.

Meanwhile, Grandmaster Liangqiu was still watching the sky attentively. He was still watching the image of the Four Symbols Divine Beasts. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, the Four Symbols Divine Beasts in the sky began to change. Soon, the golden light that filled the sky began to enter Chu Feng’s body.

That region finally began to return to normal.

As for Chu Feng, he opened his eyes.

“Chu Feng, your cultivation.”

At the instant Chu Feng opened his eyes, Grandmaster Liangqiu revealed a look of shock.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s cultivation was no longer that of a rank three Exalted. Instead, it was that of a rank five Exalted.

Chu Feng actually managed to make two successive breakthroughs without actually causing any Heavenly Tribulation Lightning.

This meant that Chu Feng’s breakthrough in cultivation was unrelated to his bloodline power.

If it was unrelated to his bloodline power, there could only be one possible explanation. Likely, this was the benefit Chu Feng obtained from fusing with his Divine Power.

“Senior, I’ve succeeded," Chu Feng said to Grandmaster Liangqiu with a wide smile on his face. Then, he looked to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and bowed respectfully. “Thank you senior.”

Compared to Grandmaster Liangqiu’s excitement and joy, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist reacted rather calm and collected. It was as if he had anticipated it all.

“Don’t bother thanking me. If you really want to repay me, it’s better that you do it with actions," said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Senior, if there’s anything that you need this junior’s assistance with, please do not hesitate to tell me,” said Chu Feng.

“There is indeed one thing that I need your help with."

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words, he looked to Grandmaster Liangqiu and revealed a vile smile on his face.

“Cough, cough...”

“Old thing, if you want me to leave, just say it.”

Grandmaster Liangqiu understood the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s intention and rolled his eyes at him. Then, he looked to Chu Feng. “Chu Feng, this old man will wait for you at the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation.”

After he finished saying those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu leapt forth and flew towards the the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation.

After Grandmaster Liangqiu left, only Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist remained.

“Senior, what matter could this junior help you with?” asked Chu Feng.

“I have an old friend in the All-heaven Starfield.”

“While that old friend of mine is a friend, he is also an old enemy. Thus, the two of us have an agreement.”

“We will each take on a disciple and nurture that person. When the time is right, he will send forth his disciple to challenge me. I, on the other hand, will send forth my disciple to challenge him.”

“If my disciple successfully defeats his, it would mean that I’ve won.”

“If his disciple successfully defeats mine, it would mean that he has won.”

“If our disciples fail to defeat each other, it would mean that we’ve tied.”

“However, as I’ve been unable to find a suitable disciple the entire time, we’ve been unable to honor this agreement.”

“Now that I have you as my disciple, you should help me finish this agreement.”

“After you finish settling your dispute with the Linghu Heavenly Clan, go to the All-heaven Starfield.”

“That is the place where that old codger is located. Once you reach that place, just inform him that you’re the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he tossed a map to Chu Feng.

“But senior, this junior is not your disciple,” said Chu Feng.

“What’s this? You spoke as if you would help me with anything earlier, yet now you’re refusing to help me with something this minor?”

“Even if you do not wish to become this old man’s disciple, you can pretend to be this old man’s disciple. You can do that, no?”

“This old man has not accepted a single disciple in all these years. It is not that this old man cannot find a disciple, it’s simply that my requirements are too high.”

“However, that old codger felt that it’s because this old man is incompetent. He felt that it’s because this old man is unable to get anyone to become his disciple. I’ve been ridiculed by him for many hundreds of years because of this matter.”

“You should also know how much this old man cares about his reputation. Yet, I’ve been ridiculed for so many years.”

“How could I possibly tolerate this?”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist narrowed his brows and was looking at Chu Feng with glaring wide eyes.

From his look, it seemed like Chu Feng would be extremely disgraceful and unfilial should he refuse to agree to help him.

Helpless, Chu Feng agreed to it, “Very well. Senior, this junior will help you with that.”

“After this junior is finished with taking care of the matter with the Linghu Heavenly Clan, I will immediately proceed for the All-heaven Starfield.”

“That’s more like it.”

Seeing that Chu Feng had agreed to help, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s expression immediately changed. He not only took back his look of anger, but he even smiled gleefully.

“That said, senior, how are you so confident in this junior?”

“What this junior is planning to challenge is the Linghu Heavenly Clan.”

“How are you so certain that this junior will be able to return safe and alive?” asked Chu Feng.

“It’s merely a Linghu Heavenly Clan, what is there to fear?”

“If you’re unable to even handle them, you’ll be unqualified to be this old man’s disciple.”

“Chu Feng, remember this. The disciple of this old man is someone who will stand atop the Holy Light Galaxy, stand atop the vast martial cultivation world.”

“If a small place like the Ancestral Martial Starfield is capable of restraining you, even if you want to become this old man’s disciple in the future, I will not accept you,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Senior, judging from your tone, the Ancestral Martial Starfield is an extremely weak place?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s precisely so,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“In that case senior, how does the Ancestral Martial Starfield compared to all the starfields of the Holy Light Galaxy?” Chu Feng asked with great curiosity.

Even though Chu Feng had learned about the structure of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he was still very unfamiliar with the Holy Light Galaxy.

Even though he was in the Holy Light Galaxy, it remained an unknown place to him.

It was unknown, mysterious and dangerous. Yet... it also gave off an enormous sense of enticement.

“How does the Ancestral Martial Starfield compare?”

“In the Holy Light Galaxy, the status of the Ancestral Martial Starfield is akin to the status of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Ancestral Martial Lower Realm,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The Ancestral Martial Lower Realm could not even compare to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. How could it possibly compare to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?

Thus, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words had revealed to Chu Feng how enormous the disparity between the Ancestral Martial Starfield and the top starfields of the Holy Light Galaxy was.

That said, Chu Feng was feeling slightly skeptical. Thus, he asked, “Being all starfields, could the disparity really be that vast?”

“Of course it’ll be vast. There are a total of ninety-six starfields in the Holy Light Galaxy.”

“Among them, fifty are known as Lower Starfields.”

“Thirty are Middle Starfields.”

“And six are Upper Starfields.”

“From their names, you should know the disparity between the starfields, no?” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“I am able to have a rough idea,” Chu Feng nodded. However, he soon asked, “In that case, what about the remaining ten starfields?”

“The final ten starfields, due to being too weak, are known as the Abandoned Starfields.”

“Those ten starfields are unqualified to even participate in the gathering for the grand occasions of the Holy Light Galaxy. As for the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it is the weakest of of the ten Abandoned Starfields,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.
