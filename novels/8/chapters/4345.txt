Chapter 4345: Master Is Going To Die?

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist began setting up a formation in order to manipulate the divine energy in the air.

Even though Chu Feng was some distance away, through his Heaven’s Eyes, he was still able to see the situation the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was in clearly.

The energy released by the Qilin’s egg grew stronger and stronger, such that the situation was swiftly becoming more and more precarious.

On the other hand, however, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was no longer shoved aside by the pulses of energy anymore. He had begun working on setting up a double-layered formation simultaneously.

The first layer of the formation served to fend away the energy that was being released by the Qilin’s egg, and the second layer was to channel the divine energy in the air to suppress the Qilin’s egg.

It was just that the formation that was used to suppress the Qilin’s egg was extremely difficult to set up. Even someone of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s caliber was unable to do it within a short span of time.

As time ticked by, Chu Feng noticed that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s face had not only turned pale, but blood was even flowing out of his seven apertures.

Following that, cracks began appearing all over his body, and blood seeped out from those cracks too.

Seeing the state of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, words couldn’t begin to describe just how worried Chu Feng was.

But before Chu Feng could even make a move, the voice of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had already sounded in the air. “Don’t come over, or else everything will be in vain! Both you and I will die!”

Given the current situation, no matter how worried Chu Feng was, he had no choice but to hide in a corner. There was nothing he could do to help at all.

Soon, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was completely cloaked in a layer of blood, and lacerations could be seen all over his body. His aura was beginning to wither as well.

Time seemed to go by extremely slowly in a situation like this.

Chu Feng really couldn’t tell how long the Ox-nosed Old Daoist could hold on in his current state.

Weng!

However, after three hours that felt like an eternity, a ray of hope finally arrived.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had successfully set up the formation to suppress the Qilin’s egg.

The powerful formation enveloped large swathes of land after forming before abruptly contracting on the Qilin’s egg, pouring its energy into it.

In an instant, the pulsations of energy from the Qilin’s egg stopped altogether, and runes and symbols appeared on its surface.

“Chu Feng, come here.”

It was only when the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words that Chu Feng dared to head back to where the Qilin’s egg was.

“Infuse your energy into the Qilin’s egg,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

Not daring to hesitate for even the slightest moment, he quickly carried out the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s instructions and infused his energy into the Qilin’s egg.

As soon as he infused his energy, he could feel a unique connection being forged between him and the Qilin’s egg.

It was just that this connection felt a little bizarre and unnatural to him. It was very different from the connection he had with his world spirits.

“Release formation!”

After Chu Feng infused his energy into the Qilin’s egg, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist bellowed loudly, and that divine yet powerful formation that was sealing off the Qilin’s egg vanished without a trace.

It was just that the Qilin’s egg no longer rampaged as it did before. In fact, it seemed to be even quieter than before.

On the other hand, however, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist fell backward and collapsed to the floor on his bottom.

“Master!”

Chu Feng immediately rushed forward and used his spirit power to treat the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

But to his shock, he found himself utterly helpless before the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s current condition.

“It’s nothing much. I just need to rest for a while.”

Even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist claimed that he was fine, blood was still trickling down his face and body. He looked like a severely injured individual who was already standing before death’s door.

Chu Feng couldn’t help but feel his heart ache watching such a sight.

“Chu Feng, that Qilin won’t break out of its egg for the time being under the effects of the formation. Even if it does so, under the effects of the formation, it won’t be able to hurt you either. However, this formation only prevents it from hurting you. You still won’t be able to control it yet.

“This Qilin will surely become a formidable beast in the future. Even if it doesn’t become a Divine Beast, it won’t be too much weaker than them. If you could use it well, it’ll surely become a powerful aid to you in the future,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Master, I didn’t know that you’d have to pay such a heavy price to set up this formation. If only I had known, I would have thrown this Qilin’s egg away a long time ago!”

Chu Feng felt deeply guilty inside. He didn’t expect that this matter would deal such a heavy blow to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The entire time, he could only stare helplessly by the side as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist grew weaker and weaker.

“This has nothing to do with you. My old wounds are simply relapsing. Your master is, after all, a person who has died once before. The body I’m currently in is incomplete, so whenever I set up overly powerful formations, my body will tear open.

“I know that it might look painful to you, but in truth... Yeah, it’s actually that painful. Hahaha...”

Speaking up to this point, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into laughter.

Even though it might seem like he was joking, Chu Feng could tell that he wasn’t kidding around when he said those words.

“Master, I’ll avenge you. I’ll make the Dao Enlightenment Sage Exalted and Sima Xiangtu experience the pain you felt a thousand times over,” Chu Feng said determinedly.

“Good. As expected of my good disciple! I believe that you’ll definitely do it one day. It’s just a pity that I might not be there when that day comes,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Master, you... What are you saying?”

Chu Feng felt a clench in his heart when he heard those words from his master. An ominous premonition loomed in his heart.

“My incomplete body won’t be able to hold on for too long. Perhaps suppressing that egg might be the last thing I’ll ever do for you as your master,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said with a light smile.

But Chu Feng felt a sour feeling in his nose when he saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s smile, and his eyes grew a little moist.

There was a trace of bitterness on the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s smile. It was a smile filled with helplessness and powerlessness. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This drove in the fact for Chu Feng that his master really wasn’t kidding around. His master’s days were truly numbered...
