Chapter 4398: A Heavy Price

“Elder, it’s you?”

Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed in astonishment upon seeing the true appearance of the mysterious expert.

Standing before him was a middle-aged woman who commanded an imposing disposition. He recognized this woman—she was the one who saved him, Wang Yuxian, and the others back when they were trapped in the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s Pill Concoction Pavilion.

She was the good friend of the Lady of Dao Sea.

“Take a look again.”

The middle-aged woman chuckled as her appearance began changing once more. This time, it wasn’t just her face but even her clothes too.

And when she was done transforming, the look of shock in Chu Feng’s eyes grew even deeper.

She had turned into an entirely different person, but despite so, Chu Feng still recognized her. She was the Lady of Dao Sea.

“Elder, does this mean to say that... it has been you all along?”

Chu Feng widened his eyes in realization as he came to understand what was going on.

The truth was that the ones who saved him, Wang Yuxian, and the others had been the Lady of Dao Sea all along. That was also why the Lady of Dao Sea would know about the vile actions of the Soaring Flower Gazebo.

That would also explain why his tracking compass would suddenly turn awry. Most likely, the Lady of Dao Sea had already caught the black streak back then.

It was the Lady of Dao Sea who lured him over to this city.

Or to be more exact, from the first time Chu Feng met Wang Yuxian and the others, the Lady of Dao Sea was already present. It was just that she was concealing herself, such that no one knew that she was there.

“Un.”

The Lady of Dao Sea nodded her head slightly, affirming Chu Feng’s thoughts.

“Elder, why did you conceal your identity back at the Soaring Flower Gazebo? Why didn’t you want your disciples to know that you were there?”

Chu Feng could understand why the Lady of Dao Sea might have been guarded against him, but he couldn’t make sense of why the Lady of Dao Sea would want to deceive her disciples too.

“I commanded them to leave the Dao Sea to accrue some experiences and temper themselves, so I didn’t want them to have the impression that there’s someone around to protect them in times of danger. However, they are still my disciples in the end, so how can I really bear to let any harm come unto them?” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

Chu Feng immediately understood.

The reason why Wang Yuxian and the others were hunting down demonic beings was most likely due to the orders from the Lady of Dao Sea. However, the Lady of Dao Sea didn’t feel assured leaving them by themselves, so she followed them from the shadows.

But at the same time, she couldn’t let Wang Yuxian and the others know that she was around, or else they would simply come to rely on her instead. If so, the purpose of the mission would have been rendered meaningless.

That was also why the Lady of Dao Sea had disguised herself as someone else when she saved them at the Soaring Flower Gazebo.

“Elder, did you lure me here just because you wanted me to obtain the treasure from the Sagacious Grandmaster from you?”

Somehow, Chu Feng felt that this wasn’t the end of the matter yet.

Someone of the Lady of Dao Sea’s standing wouldn’t need to resort to such trouble just to obtain a treasure. Besides, even going by Chu Feng’s standards, the treasure wasn’t particularly valuable either.

“This item is useful to Lele,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.(Lele also means Joyful in Chinese.)

“Lele? Is she your disciple too?” Chu Feng asked.

“I mean that lass, Wang Yuxian. Her little name is Lele,” the Lady of Dao Sea replied.

“I see,” Chu Feng nodded in understanding.

Wang Yuxian was a highly talented individual, and based on how those around her acted, it was apparent that she was very doted by the Lady of Dao Sea too.

It was understandable why the Lady of Dao Sea would go so far if it was for Wang Yuxian.

“Chu Feng, you were very intent to obtain this item because you have some use for it, right?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked Chu Feng.

“Yes, elder. It’s of utmost importance to me,” Chu Feng admitted to it.

The Lady of Dao Sea had seen the lengths he went in order to procure this item, so it was pointless to deny it right now. He might as well admit it so as to showcase his sincerity.

“I won’t probe into why you require it, and I can even help you to eliminate the dangerous edge of this item so as to ensure that you’ll be able to safely use it. However, you’ll need to do me a favor. As long as you help me with it, I’ll give it to you,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

“Elder, please feel free to say what you require my help on,” Chu Feng said.

“What I’m going to ask of you bears some risk, and it can damage your soul too. Your life won’t be in danger, but you’ll have to pay a heavy price for it. Even so, are you willing to do it?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked.

“Yes, I’m willing to give it a try,” Chu Feng replied.

The black streak was necessary to save the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, and it was for this that he had put his life on the line again and again to obtain it.

Since he was willing to risk his life for this, there was no way he would turn down the Lady of Dao Sea’s request.

“Follow me to the Dao Sea.”

After saying those words, the Lady of Dao Sea immediately brought Chu Feng out of the hidden world.

Surprisingly, the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea didn’t come along with them. It was only Chu Feng and the Lady of Dao Sea journeying together.

Along the way, Chu Feng learned what the request the Lady of Dao Sea had for him was.

The Lady of Dao Sea had specially prepared a training spot for Wang Yuxian, and the training spot could enhance Wang Yuxian’s bloodline, raising her capabilities from a fundamental level.

This training spot was a relic from the ancient times, and it was set up by the experts of the Ancient Era.

The Lady of Dao Sea had claimed possession of the training spot, but nevertheless, she was unable to gain full control of it. This meant that Wang Yuxian would have to count on herself if she wanted to make a breakthrough.

Nevertheless, Wang Yuxian was a smart and talented person, so making breakthroughs in her cultivation didn’t pose a problem to her at all. Under her relentless hard work, she was able to continuously enhance her bloodline, which eventually resulted in her becoming a renowned genius of the Nine Souls Galaxy.

Currently, she was already at the final trial in the training spot.

As long as Wang Yuxian could overcome the final trial, her bloodline would undergo a metamorphosis. However, the problem was that the final trial had Wang Yuxian stumbled too.

She had tried challenging it multiple times, only to end in failure every single time.

She was unable to clear this trial because it necessitated the use of world spiritist techniques. However, due to Wang Yuxian’s unique constitution, she was unable to grasp world spiritist techniques.

Due to this limitation, it was very likely that she wouldn’t be able to overcome the final trial in her lifetime unless they were to resort to special means.

And it was due to that that the Lady of Dao Sea had engaged Chu Feng’s help.

Just like Wang Yuxian, Chu Feng was of the younger generation, and he was skilled in world spiritist techniques.

The Lady of Dao Sea wanted him to help her overcome this final trial.

It was just that the training spot had already become interconnected with Wang Yuxian’s bloodline, such that outsiders, including Chu Feng, wouldn’t be able to enter it.

There was one way around it though, and that was to alter Chu Feng’s body in a specific manner so that he was able to resonate with Wang Yuxian’s bloodline. As long as he could earn the acknowledgment of the training spot, he would be able to enter the grounds.

However, this alteration was not completely harmless, and Chu Feng would have to pay a heavy price for it.
