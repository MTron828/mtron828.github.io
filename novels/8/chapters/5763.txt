Chapter 5763: Huangfu Heavenly Clan’s Past

“I’ll have to draw it out?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re the one who awakened the Genesis Bloodline. Who else but you?” Liu Kuo asked.

“Could the Nine Heavens’ Zenith be related to the Genesis Bloodline?” Chu Feng asked.

“Spot-on, Brother Chu Feng. The Genesis Bloodline is the reason the Nine Heavens’ Zenith is hosted here this time around.”

“Are you looking to awaken the Genesis Bloodline?”

“You’re thinking too much. We don’t have the power to do that. Even my master is only serving the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, let alone me. We can control a portion of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation, but we don’t know what’s going on at a deeper level. Everything that happens here is the will of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith; we are just carrying out its orders. Even the assessment formation in the cultivation ground is not a trial prepared by me and my master; it was from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Liu Kuo said.

“Are there other people in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, or is the Nine Heavens’ Zenith itself sentient? I don’t know much about the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Chu Feng said.

“It was by coincidence that my master stumbled upon a fortuitous encounter and came to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. It’s unknown whether me and my junior can continue staying in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith after my master leaves.

“To be honest, I don’t know much about the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. I only know that there is an extremely powerful formation here. We do benefit from staying at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, and we can grasp a portion of the formation’s power, but we don’t know much other than that.

“However, my master did tell me he suspects that the Nine Heavens’ Zenith has specifically chosen this place due to the Genesis Bloodline. I didn’t think he would get it right. Of course, Brother Chu Feng, you also played a huge role in this too. If not for you, I doubt anyone could have awakened the Genesis Bloodline even if the Nine Heavens’ Zenith commences,” Liu Kuo said.

At this point, Liu Kuo suddenly turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Do you know why there are no records about the Genesis Bloodline’s effects?”

“Why?” Chu Feng asked.

“In the ancient records, it’s said that a large group of a thousand people, comprising powerful cultivators and world spiritists, came together to awaken the Genesis Bloodline. The Soul Fog can be used by multiple people, but the Genesis Bloodline only recognizes one person. Thus, they came to an agreement that whoever wins the Genesis Bloodline’s recognition will receive it.

“They did manage to awaken the Genesis Bloodline, but none of them was able to conquer it. Naturally, no one knows what the power of the Genesis Bloodline was. They could only fathom a guess about it,” Liu Kuo explained.

“The Genesis Bloodline has quite the personality,” Chu Feng remarked.

“It does, which is why you’ll have to work hard, Brother Chu Feng. If you conquer the Genesis Bloodline, I’ll follow you from this day onward. Screw God’s Era and everything else. It’s just a matter of time before the person who has the Genesis Bloodline’s recognition becomes the strongest person in the world. Even those from the Ancient Era can’t compete,” Liu Kuo said.

“I’ll do my best, but what do I have to do?” Chu Feng asked.

He didn’t want to miss this fortuitous encounter, but he had no idea what he had to do since he knew next to nothing about the Genesis Bloodline.

“How am I supposed to know? What do you think?” Liu Kuo replied.

“Since the Nine Heavens’ Zenith has commenced, I’d guess that the secret lies in the trials we’ll be undergoing next,” Chu Feng deduced.

“That’s possible, but there’s no guarantee that’s it,” Liu Kuo replied.

“We’ll see. I’ll pay attention to it.”

“Keep an eye on the five Huangfus too.”

They had openly chatted about the Genesis Bloodline as they were the only ones here but for some reason, Liu Kuo switched to voice transmission upon mentioning the Huangfu Heavenly Clan.

“You know something about them?” Chu Feng replied via voice transmission.

He had previously heard from the Totem Dragon Clan that a Heavenly God level cultivator had once wreaked havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and he suspected that person was from the same Huangfu Heavenly Clan as the five Huangfus.

The ancient cultivators were still alive in the present era, but they were trapped underground or in some kind of forbidden land or remnant. They weren’t allowed to freely roam the world like the cultivators of the present era.

Yet, someone from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan emerged from wherever he was trapped in and wreaked havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. While he went missing afterward, it was perplexing how he had regained his freedom in the first place.

It was also perplexing how the five juniors from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan had come to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

This suggested that the Huangfu Heavenly Clan had devised some kind of special method to free themselves from their restraints. Alternatively, it could also mean that they had always been free, just that they had kept a low profile thus far.

Regardless, the fact that five juniors from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan had appeared during God’s Era meant that the Huangfu Heavenly Clan wasn’t planning to stay in hiding anymore. They wanted to share the day with the present-day cultivators.

Or perhaps, their ambitions might be even greater.

Chu Feng thought that he had to find out more about the Huangfu Heavenly Clan.

“As someone from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, I shouldn’t be telling you about the history of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, as it might compromise the fairness of the trial, but it wouldn’t do for me to remain silent given our relationship. However, you mustn’t share what I’m going to tell you with anyone else,” Liu Kuo replied via voice transmission.

“I’ll keep it a secret,” Chu Feng replied.

“I don’t know the current situation in the Huangfu Heavenly Clan, but I heard that they once had a formidable prodigy named Huangfu Yutian. Huangfu Yutian came to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith at a young age back then, and it was an era with many outstanding juniors. It might be lacking compared to the current era, but it doesn’t pale much in comparison.

“Huangfu Yutian rose above all other prodigies in that tournament and claimed the title of the strongest. We don’t have any records about the reward he received from the tournament, but the reward is said to grant his descendants an advantage in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“The Huangfu Heavenly Clan did participate in the following iterations of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, but they never did win anything again. This hints that they are still hoarding the reward Huangfu Yutian received from his victory. The Huangfu Heavenly Clan then went missing, and this is the first time they appeared in the present era.

“I suspect that Huangfu Shengyu and the others came prepared. They are probably equipped with the reward Huangfu Yutian won back then,” Liu Kuo said via voice transmission.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“The five Huangfus did well for the entrance trial because they had the experience of their predecessors’ experience to fall back on?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course,” Liu Kuo replied.

“How convenient it is for them, but it’s fine. I like it when the opponent is stronger,” Chu Feng said.

“Hehe! I like this personality of yours!” Liu Kuo remarked with a chuckle.

“Brother Liu Kuo, is it possible for you to check on Wang Qiang?” Chu Feng asked.

“Brother Chu Feng, I don’t have the power to do as I please in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. I know what’s happening in your residence because you triggered the formation through the cultivation ground, but I can’t peek into what’s happening in the other residences,” Liu Kuo explained.

“Can you bring me into Wang Qiang’s residence?” Chu Feng asked.

“I can do that. You’re good brothers anyway, so I don’t think he’d have a problem with that. When do you want to head over?” Liu Kuo asked.

“Right now.”

“Let’s go.”

Liu Kuo quickly brought Chu Feng over, but the two of them froze up upon arriving at the entrance of Wang Qiang’s residence.
