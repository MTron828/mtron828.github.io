Chapter 3524 - The Arrival Of Numerous Experts Offering Congratulations

Why would the Tang Heavenly Clan, one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, suddenly appear here? Furthermore, why would they be beating their gong as if they were celebrating something?

Everyone was confused by the Tang Heavenly Clan’s arrival. Even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were no exception.

That said, no one dared to show any disrespect to the Tang Heavenly Clansmen. Even the majestic armies of the Hong Beast Clan and Goldenstone Royal Clan moved to either side to open up a path when they saw the incoming Tang Heavenly Clansmen. They were deeply afraid of blocking their path.

Finally, the Tang Heavenly Clansmen stopped.

The people outside the war chariot all stood in a refined, orderly and courteous manner. The people that walked out from the war chariot behaved in the same manner as those standing outside.

Among the people that walked out from the war chariot, an old man with a head of gray hair was the most eye-catching.

“It’s Tang Guohui.”

The crowd grew even more curious upon seeing that old man.

Tang Guohui was not only a Supreme Elder of the Tang Heavenly Clan, but he was also the second strongest person in the Tang Heavenly Clan. He possessed extremely powerful strength.

Even in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, Tang Guohui was someone who wielded some weight.

Even the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief was much weaker compared to him.

Why would a person like Tang Guohui appear in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm? Why would he come to the Chu Heavenly Clan?

Furthermore, what were they celebrating by striking the gong?

The crowd became more and more puzzled.

“I, Tang Guohui, have came to congratulate the Chu Heavenly Clan on behalf of our Tang Heavenly Clan.”

Tang Guohui clasped his fist respectfully before the crowd.

“Congratulate? Congratulate what?”

The crowd were all confused.

It was not only the crowd. Even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were confused.

“We pay our respects to Elder Tang. Elder Tang, you’ve traveled a great distance to come here. Please excuse our Chu Heavenly Clan for not going out to meet you.”

Although they were confused, the elders in charge of guarding the Chu Heavenly Clan’s borders, when faced with someone like Tang Guohui, had all emerged, and were trembling with fear. They were so afraid that they were unable to hide the fear on their faces. They feared that they would end up being killed should they say something wrong.

“We have arrived unsolicited. It’s us who are acting impudently,” Tang Guohui said with a smile. His attitude was very good-natured.

At that moment, it was not only the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were completely confused; the various powers from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were also completely lost. The Goldenstone Royal Clan and Hong Beast Clan were also completely puzzled.

The Tang Heavenly Clan was stronger than the Li Heavenly Clan. Compared to the Li Heavenly Clan, the Tang Heavenly Clan was even more overbearing. Normally, they would act very rude, unreasonable, arrogant and despotic.

Thus, why would they be so courteous when facing minor elders of the Chu Heavenly Clan?

“Look! That’s the Puyang Heavenly Clan!”

“There’s also the Wuma Heavenly Clan!”

Suddenly, people noticed that there were two more groups of people rushing over together.

Those two groups were respectively the Puyang Heavenly Clan and the Wuma Heavenly Clan. Of course, that Wuma Heavenly Clan was the one ranked among the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, the branch clan. Had it been the main clan, the crowd would not have such a major reaction to their arrival.

Soon, the Puyang Heavenly Clansmen and Wuma Heavenly Clansmen arrived before the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory. Two individuals emerged from the two groups.

“I am Puyang Dongliu.”

“I am Wuma Chuansong.”

“We have come to congratulate the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

Come to offer congratulations again?

Exactly what was the matter worthy of congratulations?

Confusion filled the crowd’s faces. At the same time, they became endlessly curious. Both Puyang Dongliu and Wuma Chuansong were Supreme Elders of their respective clans.

With even the two of them arriving to congratulate the Chu Heavenly Clan, exactly what sort of happy occasion had happened to the Chu Heavenly Clan?

That said, what astonished the crowd the most was that there were more and more powerful individuals from various powers arriving nonstop.

After a short period of time passed, over a hundred different powers had gathered there in succession. Some wanted to pay a visit to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Some came to offer congratulations.

Furthermore, among those powers were the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, Shangfang Heavenly Clan and Moyi Heavenly Clan. They were all part of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans.

With the situation being like that, the elders of the Chu Heavenly Clan were sweating cold sweat unceasingly.

Although those people were all here to offer congratulations, they did not mention what it was that they wanted to congratulate them for. Thus, the elders had no idea if their arrival was a blessing or a calamity.

That said, those elders found themselves in a truly difficult situation when faced with all those grand characters. They did not know how to face them.

“Friends, may I know what sort of happy occasion worthy of congratulations has happened to our Chu Heavenly Clan?”

Finally, a voice was heard. Then, several figures appeared.

It was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the peak experts of the Chu Heavenly Clan. They had all arrived.

“It would appear that Clan Chief Chu still doesn’t know what has happened in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm,” a voice was heard. That voice sounded from far away.

Looking toward the direction of the voice, another group of people could be seen flying over. It was the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

The person leading that group of people was one of the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders, Tantai Yinjian, a peak Exalted-level expert!!!

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief advanced and greeted Tantai Yinjian respectfully. After showing his respects, he asked, “Elder Tantai, have you also come to our clan to offer congratulations?”

“Precisely,” Tantai Yinjian smiled.

At that moment, the people from the other powers that had come to offer congratulations all looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with smiles on their faces.

It was as if they had all discussed it with each other beforehand, and had all decided to beat around the bush. They were all speaking of coming to offer congratulations, yet were refusing to speak of what the matter worthy of congratulations was.

“Exactly what sort of happy occasion has happened to our clan?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was very puzzled.

“Brother Chu, that Chu Feng... obtained the first ranked spot in this year’s selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars. Is this not a happy occasion worthy of congratulations?” asked Tantai Yinjian.

“Ah?!!!!!!”

It was not only the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief; even the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief, the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief and all the experts of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm present were all completely astonished. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They naturally all knew that Chu Feng was from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Merely, to have become the first ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, was this... truly real?

Seemingly understanding the crowd’s current state of mind, Tantai Yinjian smiled. He said to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, “It would appear that even Brother Chu is unable to accept this matter. However, that’s alright. You’ll soon get used to it. After all, it’s the truth.”

“Elder Tantai, could it be that our clan’s Chu Feng has really managed to obtain the first ranked spot of the Ancestral Martial Decastars?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Tantai Yinjian with a flickering gaze. He became very emotional.

“All of us present here personally witnessed it. How could it be a lie?”

“Not only did Chu Feng obtain the first ranked spot, but he also battled Linghu Hongfei for ten days and nights without a clear winner or loser.”

“In the end, the Starfield Master Realm announced that Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei were to... be ranked first together,” said Tantai Yinjian.

“Not only did he gain the first ranked spot of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, but he even managed to reach a stalemate with Linghu Hongfei to jointly be ranked first?” The crowd looked to one another. They simply did not dare to believe their ears.

Chu Feng obtaining the Ancestral Martial Decastars’s first ranked spot was already something that they found very difficult to believe. Upon hearing that he actually shared the first ranked spot with Linghu Hongfei, they felt even greater disbelief.

After all, Linghu Hongfei was the current strongest genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. He was so powerful that others from the younger generation were simply incomparable to him.

Chu Feng was actually able to reach a draw with him?!!!!

“This is real? This matter is real?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief became extremely emotional. Even his voice was trembling.

He only knew that Chu Feng had proceeded for the Nine Dragons Upper Realm together with the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He had no idea if Chu Feng had participated in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

The sudden arrival of such news struck him like a dream. He felt it to be so unrealistic.

“Brother Chu, I understand what you’re feeling. Had we not witnessed it ourselves, we would not have believed it to be true either. However, it is the truth. Your clan’s Chu Feng is so powerful that even Linghu Hongfei was unable to defeat him. The other people of the younger generation are simply powerless to even contend against him.”

“With such a member of the younger generation in your clan, there’s simply no need to worry about future prospects,” as Tantai Yinjian said those words, he was staring at the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with envy-filled eyes.

Following him, the elders from the other powers also began to speak to verify what Tantai Yinjian said to be the truth.

Some even began to vividly describe what had happened back then.

With the situation being like that, the crowd simply could not refuse to believe the matter to be true.

All of a sudden, the entire region burst into an uproar. It was not only the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were all shouting loudly with excitement, with some of them crying bitterly too, but even the various powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were endlessly excited.

As martial cultivators from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they also felt proud of Chu Feng.

That said, while the rest of the crowd were overjoyed, there were two groups of people that found themselves in a very awkward situation.

They were... the Goldenstone Royal Clan and the Hong Beast Clan.
