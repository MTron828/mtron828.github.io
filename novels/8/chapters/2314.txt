Chapter 2314 - Emperor Taboo: Highlord’s Seal

“Heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation!!!” An experienced and knowledgeable old man among the crowd shouted. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What? He actually possesses a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation?”

Upon hearing those words, the crowd came to a sudden realization as to why Chu Feng was able to easily defeat that Highlord’s Mansion’s disciple even though they were both rank five Half Martial Ancestors.

A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, that was no ordinary heaven-defying battle power.

Thus, upon knowing Chu Feng’s strength, the crowd had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng. Once again, they revealed gazes of reverence.

In fact, many people started to feel lingering fear over the fact that they had insulted Chu Feng earlier due to their ignorance. They were afraid that Chu Feng would find them for retaliation.

“Heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation? The two of you both possess quite decent battle power. Unfortunately, your cultivations are too weak,” Di Jiuzhou smiled indifferently. Compared to the others, he remained completely calm.

“Release my junior brother immediately, then kneel and beg for forgiveness. If you are to do that, I can consider sparing your life,” Di Jiuzhou ordered Chu Feng.

Although his tone was very arrogant, the crowd did not feel that Di Jiuzhou was boasting.

After all, Di Jiuzhou’s cultivation was before them, and his strength was also present to them. Even if Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, even if Chu Feng was a rank five Half Martial Ancestor, the crowd still did not think that Chu Feng would be Di Jiuzhou’s match.

However, right at this moment when everyone felt that this battle would end with Chu Feng’s defeat, Chu Feng made an action that stunned the crowd.

Chu Feng suddenly tightened his grip. Then, with a muffled ‘bang,’ the Highlord’s Mansion’s disciple that he had grabbed exploded and splattered everywhere. He was completely dead.

“You!!!”

“You dare kill someone from our Highlord’s Mansion?!”

At this moment, the disciples from the Highlord’s Mansion all revealed dumbstruck expressions. While they were furious, they were more astonished.

They truly never expected that Chu Feng would actually dare to kill their fellow disciple. After all, the person who Chu Feng had killed was a core disciple of the Highlord’s Mansion, one of their management elder’s personal disciples. Chu Feng’s killing of him was equivalent to him stating that he would make an enemy of the Highlord’s Mansion.

However, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged after killing that man.

With a cold voice, he said, “I am able to tolerate those who humiliate me, Chu Feng.”

“However, I absolutely will not spare those that humiliate my brother!”

“Boom~~~”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd were all startled. Some people even felt as if their heads were exploding. They were truly shocked.

It was not that they were cowards. Rather, Chu Feng’s reputation was truly too renowned.

He was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, an exceptional genius.

Most importantly, he was someone who dared to kill even Ying Liangchen.

“You said that you are Chu Feng?” At this moment, even Di Jiuzhou had a change in expression. The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng turned serious.

“Precisely,” As Chu Feng spoke, he removed his conical bamboo hat and put it away in his Cosmos Sack.

“It really is him?!”

Upon seeing Chu Feng’s actual appearance, the already alarmed crowd were shocked shivering.

The reason for that was because the Ying Heavenly Clan had already publicly displayed Chu Feng’s portrait to the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Practically everyone knew what Chu Feng looked like.

Upon thinking that the person before them was truly that malignant star who dared to kill even Ying Liangchen, how could the crowd not be scared?

Not to mention the others, the complexions of even the disciples from the Highlord’s Mansion had turned pale. Involuntarily, they took several steps back. Not to mention strength, merely Chu Feng’s past achievements were already enough to cause them fear.

“Hahaha!!!”

Right at the moment when the great majority of the people were frightened by Chu Feng, that Di Jiuzhou burst into loud laughter.

“Very well. Chu Feng, the person that I am searching for is none other than you,” As Di Jiuzhou spoke, he unleashed his Divine Power. Immediately, his cultivation increased from rank seven Half Martial Ancestor to rank eight Half Martial Ancestor. At the same time, he also revealed his heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation.

At this moment, Di Jiuzhou’s actual battle power was on par with ordinary rank one Martial Ancestors.

Even though Di Jiuzhou was not afraid of Chu Feng, he had unleashed his full strength from the very beginning.

The reason for that was because he knew that Chu Feng was a wielder of a Heavenly Bloodline. His true strength was most definitely not as simple as the rank five Half Martial Ancestor cultivation he was currently displaying.

“Zzzzz~~~”

Right at this moment, Chu Feng unleashed both his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings. In an instant, Chu Feng’s cultivation increased from rank five Half Martial Ancestor to rank seven Half Martial Ancestor.

Furthermore, Chu Feng completely revealed his heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.

The current Chu Feng was the same as Di Jiuzhou. His true battle power was on par with ordinary rank one Martial Ancestors.

“Crash~~~”

Sensing the aura being emitted by the two men, the bystanders immediately soared into the sky and escaped far away.

Even though Chu Feng and Di Jiuzhou’s cultivations were only those of Half Martial Ancestors, everyone felt that they were no longer ordinary Half Martial Ancestors. After all, the two of them possessed strength comparable to that of ordinary rank one Martial Ancestors.

Although they might still not be able to beat rank one Martial Ancestors, they were already capable of fighting against rank one Martial Ancestors without immediately dying.

A battle between people like them was not something that the crowd could bear to watch at a close distance. Even when watching from afar, they must maintain their distance.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at this moment, ear-piercing rumbles were heard. Chu Feng and Di Jiuzhou had started fighting.

Immediately, powerful energy ripples soon engulfed their surroundings.

Those with a low level of cultivation were unable to escape in time, and were engulfed by the energy ripples. Those that were lucky were blown away, whereas those that were unlucky ended up being seriously injured.

As for that tavern formed with a spirit formation, it was completely razed to the ground.

“Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”

The rumbles grew more and more ear-piercing. It was as if ten thousand thunderbolts were striking. The energy ripples grew more and more powerful. It was as if they would destroy the entire region.

“What do we do? That Chu Feng is too powerful. Senior brother Di will likely not be a match for him. We should quickly return to find reinforcements,” At this moment, the disciples from the Highlord’s Mansion started to panic. Finding reinforcements was merely an excuse. They actually just wanted to flee.

“Can you all not act with some integrity? Right now, senior brother Di is fighting a bloody battle against that Chu Feng. How could we flee at a time like this?” Another disciple from the Highlord’s Mansion said.

“Rest assured, senior brother Di will definitely be able to defeat Chu Feng. Do not forget that our senior brother Di is the strongest genius among the tier two powers.”

“There’s only those couple geniuses in the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm that could contend against senior brother Di. Furthermore, those geniuses are all the super geniuses of the tier one powers.”

“You all couldn’t possibly be thinking that this Chu Feng, who has an unidentified origin and might be a bastard child from a Heavenly Clan, will really be able to compare with the tier one powers’ super geniuses, right?” A female disciple said.

She was the person who had declared Chu Feng to be a trash and received a slap from Wang Qiang.

“That’s true. We should be confident in senior brother Di,” After hearing what that female disciple said, the disciples from the Highlord’s Mansion grew confident again.

“Roar~~~”

Right at this moment, a strange roar sounded from Chu Feng and Di Jiuzhou’s battlefield.

Turning toward the direction of the crowd, toward that region covered with energy ripples, a strange purple light could be seen. At the same time, an enormously powerful aura began to be emitted.

“Look! That is our Highlord’s Mansion’s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill, the Emperor Taboo: Highlord’s Seal!!!”

“Heavens! Senior brother Di, he... he actually managed to successfully master the Emperor Taboo: Highlord’s Seal!”

“Haha, this is truly great. That Chu Feng is truly unlucky to have encountered our senior brother Di.”

At this moment, the disciples from the Highlord’s Mansion all revealed overjoyed expressions. As disciples of the Highlord’s Mansion, they knew very well how powerful the Emperor Taboo: Highlord’s Seal was.

In their Highlord’s Mansion, there was a saying: ‘The Highlord’s Seal is unequalled in this world.’
