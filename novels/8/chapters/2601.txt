Chapter 2601 - Overcome All Obstacles

As if it was chewing, that spirit formation continued to wiggle for quite a while before calming down.

However, after that spirit formation calmed down, the exit-like gate did not open.

With the situation like this, even though the spirit formation had calmed down, the crowd present were unable to calm themselves.

“Chu Feng, Chu Feng, it’s me, Ying Mingchao. Can you hear me?”

“Chu Feng, it’s me, Zi Xunyi. If you’re fine, can you give us a response?”

Ying Mingchao, Zi Xunyi, the guardian clan’s clan chief and many other grand characters all started to panic.

That spirit formation was extremely strange. Even though this spirit formation that Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were controlling should be able to connect with Chu Feng, it was still unable to see the situation inside that healing formation, unable to catch an image of Chu Feng.

At this moment, everyone felt that Chu Feng had suffered a mishap. As such, how could they not panic?

After all, that was the Unknown Burial Ground, that frightening place where countless geniuses had lost their lives.

After Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi called out for Chu Feng repeatedly with no response from the spirit formation that Chu Feng was in, the crowd felt that Chu Feng might’ve already died. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Little friend Chu Feng was simply too stubborn. Why didn’t he listen to Lord City Master? Now he has suffered the consequences of his own actions.”

“It is truly a pity. An generation’s exceptional genius has fallen just like this. This is a major loss to our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”

At this moment, the crowd burst into an uproar. Some felt pity for Chu Feng, whereas others felt distress. Some even started to blame Chu Feng for his actions, saying that he had caused this because he refused to listen to Ying Mingchao.

“All of you, shut up!”

“If anyone dares criticize Chu Feng again, I will cut out their tongues!”

Zi Xunyi suddenly shouted. Her furious voice not only resonated through the heaven and earth, it also permeated into the hearts and souls of the crowd present, scaring many of them to a state of shivering.

At this moment, everyone shut their mouths. Even those that felt regret for Chu Feng’s death no longer dared utter another word.

The reason for that was because Zi Xunyi’s current expression was truly frightening. If they dared to provoke her again, they would likely not get off as easy as having only their tongues cut off. Instead, she might take their lives.

As for Zi Xunyi’s current reaction, it was actually understandable too. Although she had only known Chu Feng for a very short period of time, she thought very highly of Chu Feng. Else, she would not have come all the way here to save him.

And now, Chu Feng had most likely suffered a mishap. Yet, these people here were making cynical remarks. Naturally, she would not be able to tolerate it.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at the moment when everyone felt that Chu Feng had suffered a mishap, that spirit formation that Chu Feng had entered suddenly started to blossom with a strange light.

The next moment, that tightly closed gate actually opened.

After the gate opened, everyone revealed joyous gazes and all cast their eyes toward that opened gate.

A figure was currently walking out from that gate.

As for that person, he was none other than Chu Feng.

Merely, the current Chu Feng appeared completely different from before he entered the formation.

The current Chu Feng was actually wearing golden armor. Although that armor was a sort of body of light, it was not formed with spirit power. The crowd were unable to determine exactly what that armor was made of.

On Chu Feng’s left hand was a golden compass. Light was spinning above that compass. It was very dazzling and extraordinary.

In Chu Feng’s right hand was a large golden blade. Although the crowd were unable to feel the mighty aura of that blade, they were able to tell merely by looking at it that that golden blade was extremely powerful.

Most importantly, Chu Feng currently appeared to be extremely spirited. In fact, he appeared much more spirited compared to the first time the crowd saw him.

Evidently, Chu Feng had made a full recovery.

“Success! Chu Feng actually succeeded!!!”

A tsunami-like cheer sounded from the vast crowd.

Merely, this time around, they were no longer whispering and making their own assessments about Chu Feng’s decision. Instead, it was all cheers.

Everyone was celebrating. They were all cheering for Chu Feng being still alive. They were all cheering for Chu Feng’s success.

“That spirit formation seems to have had an isolation effect. While I was able to hear seniors’ voices, it seemed that seniors were unable to hear my voice. I have made seniors worry for me,” Chu Feng said in an apologetic manner.

It was as Chu Feng said. While he was in the healing formation, he was able to hear the voices of the crowd.

When Ying Mingchao and the others asked Chu Feng if he was fine, Chu Feng had responded to them. However, it was very evident that they were unable to hear his voice.

Even though Chu Feng was clearly fine, he had made everyone worry for him. As such, Chu Feng was feeling apologetic.

“It’s fine, all that matters is that you’re fine. Everything’s good now that you’re fine,” Zi Xunyi had turned into a completely different person compared to before. There was no longer any trace of anger on her face. Instead, it was replaced with a beautiful smile.

“Chu Feng, all those treasures of yours, did you obtain them from that formation?” Ying Mingchao asked.

“Senior Ying, these were indeed obtained from the healing formation. This golden armor, compass and war blade all possess different sorts of power. They were all able to help me pass through this Life and Death Formation,” Chu Feng said.

“Good, good, good. This is truly good.”

“It would seem that you’ve made the correct gamble. The comprehension you’ve obtained from that illusion was indeed feasible.”

“Since that’s the case, Chu Feng, there’s no time to delay. Take advantage of the fact that those treasures are still there to immediately attempt to break through the formation,” Ying Mingchao urged.

Merely by seeing them with his naked eyes, Ying Mingchao was able to tell that Chu Feng’s golden armor, blade and compass were all treasures of an immaterial nature.

As they were not formed from actual materials, they would sooner or later disappear. Ying Mingchao was afraid that those treasures would disappear too quickly and affect Chu Feng’s progress in breaking through the formation.

“That is precisely what this junior planned.”

After Chu Feng said those words, he began to rely on the spirit formations that he had comprehended from that illusion to break through the various grand slaughtering formations.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng felt that there was simply no way out of this so-called Life and Death Formation.

He felt that he would have to break through each and every slaughtering formation present here if he wanted to leave.

Originally, with the comprehension that Chu Feng had obtained from that illusion, he only held a thirty percent certainty in being able to break through this Life and Death Formation.

However, to Chu Feng’s enormous fortune, not only did the healing formation completely heal his injuries, but it also bestowed special powers upon him.

The special powers were naturally the golden armor, war blade and compass.

Those three items were all used for breaking through the Life and Death Formation. With those three items, Chu Feng’s certainty in successfully passing the Life and Death Formation had increased from thirty percent to fifty percent.

Fifty percent, this was a very high probability of success.

Merely, even though it was fifty percent, it still remained that it would mean there was a half and half chance of either death or life.

As such, Chu Feng needed to think meticulously about every step he took. Only then would he attempt to use the methods that he had comprehended to break through the slaughtering formations.

However, no matter how cautious and careful Chu Feng might be, many of the slaughtering formations in the Life and Death Formation still could not be trifled with.

As Chu Feng continued onward, he received many serious injuries. Fortunately, he had that golden armor.

Although that golden armor does not have an effect of blocking attacks, it had a healing effect.

Thus... at this moment, as long as it was not something fatal, Chu Feng would not have to fear.

All sorts of superficial injuries were completely cured by the golden armor.

As for that compass, it was actually a shield that possessed extremely powerful defensive capabilities. Although it was only capable of blocking head-on attacks, Chu Feng felt that it was already an extremely powerful defensive tool.

As for that war blade, it was an offensive weapon. It was capable of slicing through practically everything in the Life and Death Formation.

Merely, the slaughtering formations in the Life and Death Formation were not things that could be defeated merely by slicing through its contents.

If he wanted to break through them, he would have to use world spirit techniques.

Fortunately, as Chu Feng continued to defeat more and more slaughtering formations, the process became much easier, as Chu Feng began much more skilled in defeating the slaughtering formations.

This was especially true in the eyes of the crowd outside. To them, Chu Feng was pushing his way through the various frighteningly powerful slaughtering formations one by one without the slightest amount of fear.

To them, Chu Feng was simply overcoming all of his obstacles in a majestic manner. The airs of a king were completely prominent.
