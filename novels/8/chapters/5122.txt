Chapter 5122: What a Strong Secret Skill

“Go! Capture them!”

At his command, the tens of millions of guards immediately charged across the dried up river.

Lord Yuwei waved her sleeves, and a whirlpool of martial power formed in front of her. It swiftly expanded into a martial power barrier that sealed off the land.

Seeing that, the guards quickly screeched to a halt.

They could feel just how resilient the martial power barrier was. At the very least, it was impossible for them to overcome it. Nevertheless, they didn’t lose their composure but instead turned their sights to their leader.

“Rank one Half-God? How surprising. You managed to achieve a breakthrough?”

The leader of the guards looked at Lord Yuwei in astonishment.

“We’ll continue offering the Demonsoul Grass to you as previously promised, but you aren’t allowed to take away our people anymore. I won’t allow a single one of our people to go to your side from now onward!” Lord Yuwei said.

“Hahaha!”

The leader of the guards burst into laughter.

“Song Yuwei, did your head get kicked by a donkey? What made you think that a rank one Half-God like you could stand against a rank two Half-God like me? You have no chances against me at all,” the leader of the guards scoffed.

He released a burst of martial power at the barrier constructed by Lord Yuwei.

Whoosh!

The two forces collided, and Lord Yuwei’s barrier immediately crumbled like a mirror.

“What’s that?”

Despite his successful attack, the leader of the guards didn’t break out in glee. Instead, he was stunned. His attack was intended not just to break the martial power barrier but to take down Lord Yuwei too, but despite shattering of the barrier, the martial power he had released was still unable to close in on Lord Yuwei.

There was another layer of force in front of Lord Yuwei that had stopped the martial power he had exerted.

It was then that everyone noticed that Lord Yuwei was emanating a divine golden glow.

“It’s indeed impossible for a rank one Half-God to oppose a rank two Half-God, but I know something that can.”

Lord Yuwei pushed her palm forward, inducing violent spatial tremors where the leader of the guards were. Soon, a golden barrier surfaced.

Everyone was startled, including Chu Feng.

Whoosh!

Calls of phoenixes could be heard from the barrier. The barrier was actually composed of over a hundred gigantic phoenixes that circled around the area. What a majestic sight it was!

Most important of all, the aura given off by the barrier had already reached rank two Half-God.

“What a formidable secret skill. To think that it is able to overcome the gap of an entire cultivation rank!” Chu Feng exclaimed.

A secret skill would have to be incredibly powerful to be able to overcome the gap of a single cultivation rank at Half-God level. At the very least, Chu Feng had never seen such a powerful secret skill before.

“Elder Yuwei possesses such formidable means?”

Chu Feng knew that Lord Yuwei was unlikely to be too weak, but he didn’t think that she possessed such means. This was far beyond his expectations.

“I’ve underestimated you. I didn’t think that you would have this in you. What’s that?” the leader of the guards asked.

“You need not care what it is. You have already gotten the Demonsoul Grass, so our deal is already done. Take your men and leave right now,” Lord Yuwei persuaded.

“Song Yuwei, do you really think that something of this caliber can stop me? In the end, you’re only at rank one Half-God. No matter how powerful your means is, there’s no way you could stand against a rank two Half-God.

“I advise you to give up right now. If I have to break this barrier myself, you won’t be the only one suffering here. All of you will die here,” the leader of the guards said.

He released a burst of oppressive might mixed with frightening killing intent.

Even though Lord Yuwei’s barrier had blocked the force from the oppressive might, those present were still able to sense its terrifying pressure. More importantly, they could sense the killing intent coming from the leader of the guards.

“W-what did he just say?”

“He said that he’s going to kill us all?”

Many of those on Lord Yuwei’s side started shuddering. Fear was apparent on their faces.

“You didn’t hear wrong. I said that I’m going to massacre all of you because Song Yuwei’s actions have angered me. Do you honestly think that we wouldn’t be able to survive without you? You servants are overestimating your own value! The world will still run its course even without you!

“It’s out of compassion and pity that I kept you alive thus far, but you dare to oppose me? Disobedient servants deserve to be killed!” the leader of the guards bellowed fiercely.

“Lord Yuwei, why don’t you let them in?”

“Yeah, Lord Yuwei. It’s better to sacrifice some of us than to have all of us killed.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A few people started to persuade Lord Yuwei to step down. The words from the leader of the guards had truly left them frightened. For their survival, they were willing to sacrifice some of their brethren.

“Don’t listen to his words! He’s only trying to tempt you because he’s unable to break my barrier. Otherwise, he would have made a move straight away instead of wasting his breath on words,” Lord Yuwei told the crowd.

The crowd thought that Lord Yuwei’s words made perfect sense. The leader of the guards had always acted domineeringly, never hesitating to kill anyone who dared to cross him.

“Hahahaha…”

The leader of the guards suddenly burst into laughter.

“How foolish must you be to believe her words? Don’t you know our strength better than anyone else? If we wish to massacre all of you, do you think that you would still be standing before me right now?”

The leader of the guards turned his sights to Lord Yuwei.

“Song Yuwei, don’t say that I’m heartless. I’ll give you fifteen minutes to consider. Are you going to surrender yourself or let these people be buried together with you? You better think it through properly!”

After saying those words, the leader of the guards reached for the saber hanging on his waist. The tens of millions of guards behind him mirrored his movement.

All of them simultaneously released their killing intent, creating an aura so powerful that it distorted space. It looked sinister and terrifying, as if hell had manifested in the mortal world.

Clearly, they were prepared for slaughter.
