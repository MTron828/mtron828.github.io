Chapter 3168 - Asura God Stone

Although Chu Feng was also inside the main city, he had no idea that Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys had come and received Chu Ping’s forgiveness and been admitted into the main city.

After all, Chu Feng was currently completely focused on assimilating that spirit formation.

Sure enough, heaven does not disappoint he who tries hard enough. After Chu Feng’s efforts, he finally managed to assimilate with that spirit formation and learned the method to activate it.

“This was truly not an easy task.”

After succeeding, Chu Feng stood up with a smile on his face. Unknowingly, he was already covered in sweat. In fact, Chu Feng’s clothes were completely wet with sweat. Furthermore, his sweat was cold sweat from fear.

Although he had succeeded, Chu Feng knew very well how difficult his success had been to achieve.

It was very difficult for him to assimilate with the spirit formation. Even though it was a spirit formation set up by his grandfather and polished by his father, the spirit formation was not at all friendly toward Chu Feng. In fact, Chu Feng had almost received a backlash from the spirit formation on multiple occasions. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

If Chu Feng were to really end up sustaining a backlash, it would not be as simple as a bit of pain. Chu Feng’s consciousness would be sucked into the spirit formation, and he would be caught in an endless cycle of dreams.

Fortunately, Chu Feng ended up succeeding in the end. That was the reason why he was in such a joyous mood at that moment.

Even though that spirit formation was the weakest defensive formation there, it was still extremely powerful.

Chu Feng felt that unless one was a rank five Martial Immortal or stronger, they would simply not be able to breach the grand defensive formation.

Chu Feng did not feel that the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan had a rank five Martial Immortal among their ranks. After all, no matter how talented they might be, they were only martial cultivators within three hundred years of age.

When compared to people a thousand or even ten thousand years old, an age of three hundred and under was simply akin to a child.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that the grand defensive formation was enough to handle the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.

That said, Chu Feng did not immerse himself in a state of joy. Instead, he immediately set off to search for Her Lady Queen. He wanted to share the joyous news with her.

Upon finding Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng discovered that Her Lady Queen was sitting cross-legged on the ground and forming hand seals with both hands. She was also breathing according to a specific rhythm. She appeared to be training. Furthermore, she appeared to be very focused.

Very rarely had Chu Feng ever seen Her Lady Queen like that.

To Chu Feng’s great surprise, there was a spirit formation before Her Lady Queen. That spirit formation was very special. Firstly, it was very small. Furthermore, it was not a defensive formation, nor was it a slaughtering formation or a healing formation.

It looked like a display cabinet. As for the item that it was displaying, it was a piece of stone.

The stone was located at the center of the spirit formation, and hovering off the display cabinet.

The stone was the size of a goose egg. It was completely pitch-black, and sleek like jade.

However, regardless of whether one looked at it using one’s naked eye or inspected it using one’s special perception abilities, the stone did not appear to be special at all; it was extremely ordinary.

The spirit formation was an ordinary looking spirit formation. The stone inside the spirit formation was an ordinary looking stone. Chu Feng was unable to understand why his grandfather and his father would leave them in such an important place.

Most importantly, Her Lady Queen was so very earnest in her training. Although Chu Feng was unable to sense anything, he was able to tell that Her Lady Queen’s training was related to that spirit formation, and the stone within it.

Confused, Chu Feng crouched down beside Her Lady Queen and asked with a smile on his face. “Milady Queen, what are you doing?”

Her Lady Queen was extremely focused, so focused that she did not notice Chu Feng approaching her. It was only when Chu Feng’s voice was heard that she abruptly opened her eyes.

“Chu Feng, you’ve succeeded?” Her Lady Queen stood up and asked Chu Feng concernedly.

“It’s done,” Chu Feng said.

“My, not bad,” Seeing that Chu Feng had succeeded, Her Lady Queen revealed a joyous smile. Then, she asked, “Is that defensive formation capable of defending against the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan?”

“In my opinion, that should be no issue,” Chu Feng said.

“If that’s the case, the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan will not be able to do anything to you. Not bad, not bad,” Hearing those words, the joyous expression on Her Lady Queen’s face blossomed even more.

Originally, she was worried about Chu Feng. After all, they were able to guess that the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan would soon come to suppress them.

As for the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, they were likely not a group that Chu Feng could handle at present.

However, with the grand defensive formation, Chu Feng became confident.

“My dear Eggy, what are you doing? I saw that you were very focused earlier, it’s like you were training?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right, Chu Feng. This Queen is indeed training. That’s because this Queen has discovered a treasure,” Her Lady Queen pointed to the stone in the center of that spirit formation, “Chu Feng, do you know what that is?”

“I’ve been wanting to ask you about it. What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ll tell you this, that item is of extraordinary origin.”

“That is an Asura God Stone. In our Asura Spirit World, it is a sacred cultivation resource, and extremely rare.”

“I do not know why it would appear here of all places.”

“Although this Asura God Sword does not have a lot of power left, it is enough for this Queen to train with.”

“With it, this Queen’s cultivation will definitely be able to increase. I might even be able to break free from your mother’s restriction and surpass the current you,” Her Lady Queen said.

“That stone is actually that powerful?!” Chu Feng revealed an astonished expression. After all, the way he saw it, that simple stone appeared too ordinary, and did not resemble the ungodly nature that Her Lady Queen spoke of.

“You don’t understand. Asura God Stones are all like this. When looking at them with one’s naked eye, they will appear extremely common.”

“Not to mention you all, even the people from our Asura Spirit World will find it very difficult to distinguish an Asura God Stone’s authenticity without using special abilities.”

“However, this Queen felt it the moment I entered this place. I never expected it to truly be an Asura God Stone. Haha, this Queen has picked up a treasure this time around,” Her Lady Queen was so overjoyed that she started to act like a child.

As for Chu Feng, he became certain that Her Lady Queen was indeed training earlier. However, Chu Feng was unable to sense any power from that stone, nor was he able to sense if Her Lady Queen had gained anything from it.

“Eggy, are you certain?” Chu Feng asked again.

“Of course I’m certain, I’m absolutely certain. This Queen has most definitely not misjudged it.”

“Furthermore, whilst training earlier, I also obtained some results.”

“Merely... due to the existence of that spirit formation, it is very difficult for be to absorb power from the Asura God Stone. I will have to use a great amount of time in order to use it to train.”

“Furthermore, as I am your world spirit and we have a contract with one another, I will have to maintain a certain distance from you should I leave your world spirit space.”

“Thus, I’m afraid that you will have to spend some more time accompanying me in this place to allow me to train,” Her Lady Queen said.

“That’s not an issue. Merely...” Chu Feng revealed a confused expression.

“Merely what?” Seeing that Chu Feng was somewhat hesitant, Her Lady Queen became slightly nervous.

She wanted to increase her cultivation quickly. Thus, she wanted Chu Feng to accompany her some more.

“Merely, why must we absolutely train here? Wouldn’t it be fine to retrieve it and bring it back to my world spirit space to train there? Wouldn’t that be even better?” Chu Feng said.

“Hahahaha...” Her Lady Queen burst into sudden laughter. She was grabbing her stomach as she laughed uproariously.

Then, she pointed to Chu Feng and spoke with a mocking tone, “Chu Feng, what did you think that to be? That is an Asura God Stone! Although its power is very weak now, it is still an Asura God Stone as long as even a trace of its power still remains. As an Asura God Stone, it is not something that ordinary mortals can violate.”

“One can only move it through special formations. Otherwise, it is simply near-impossible to move. At the very least, it will be impossible for your current level of cultivation.”

Her Lady Queen was speaking on in this manner when her little face suddenly froze. She then stood there in a stunned manner.

The reason for that was because she discovered that Chu Feng had not only extended his hand into the spirit formation, he had also grabbed the Asura God Stone.

Most importantly, after grabbing the Asura God Stone, Chu Feng actually pulled the Asura God Stone from the spirit formation effortlessly.

Witnessing this with her own eyes, a never-before-seen expression of shock appeared on Her Lady Queen’s exceptionally beautiful little face.
