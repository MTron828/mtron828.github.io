Chapter 5977: Utmost Concern

“Elders, please don’t say that. If not for your help, I would have been trapped by the sealing formation and eventually captured.

“Also, Jie Tiannian promised not to tell the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that you helped me. She just wanted to save those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion; she doesn’t intend to make things difficult for us. However, I didn’t trust her, so I slipped away with my escape means despite her promise.

“Elders, do you think her words are credible?” Chu Feng asked.

“Jie Tiannian is a trustworthy person. Her words should be credible,” Daoist First Dragon said.

The other daoists agreed.

From the daoists, Chu Feng learned that Jie Tiannian had been on close terms with Jie Ranqing. She also observed propriety; she wouldn’t oppress or tyrannize others just because she was stronger than them. She had a good character.

That convinced Chu Feng to look for Jie Tiannian. He thought that he could learn more about his mother through her.

However, he didn’t tell the Totem Nine Daoists about it. It was not that he didn’t trust them, but he simply thought there was no need to share this piece of information with them.

Besides, the Totem Nine Daoists had suffered injuries despite having escaped from the remnants, so they would need time to recuperate. Fortunately, they had many hidden bases spread across the world of cultivation.

They told Chu Feng the location of the base they intended to recuperate in seclusion.

“Young hero Chu Feng, we, nine brothers, owe you a favor. Feel free to reach out to us if you need us.” Daoist First Dragon entrusted an ancient talisman to Chu Feng containing his aura. “You’ll be able to communicate with me through this talisman no matter where you are.”

“Thank you.” Chu Feng accepted the talisman.

His cultivation was still lacking, and the Totem Nine Daoists were a force to be reckoned with. There was no saying he might need them in the future.

With that, the Totem Nine Daoists took their leave.

Chu Feng also began making his way elsewhere. He didn’t leave the realm, for this was the realm Jie Tiannian had pointed him to.

Following the coordinates, he soon arrived on a barren land devoid of life. Jie Tiannian was nowhere to be seen.

However, he soon noticed that the area was layered in an exquisite concealment formation. Despite being able to see through it, it would take him significant time to unravel it, even if he used the Initiate Tome.

Weng!

Just then, a spatial rift appeared. On the other side of the rift was a bamboo forest.

Chu Feng stepped into the spatial rift, and the rift closed behind him.

His psyche and vision were severely restricted in the bamboo forest, but it was not due to a formation but a unique scent coming from the bamboo forest. This restriction didn’t make him nervous; instead, it excited him.

This restriction was beneficial to a world spiritist’s training. That explained why Jie Tiannian invited him here. She probably wanted him to train here.

His psyche and vision were limited, but there was only one path ahead of him. So, he walked down the path and soon arrived at a bamboo house. Even though his psyche and vision were limited, there was only one path ahead of him.

Outside the house, a slender figure was boiling water through a formation. She was none other than Jie Tiannian.

“You’re here.” Jie Tiannian raised her head and looked at Chu Feng with a gentle smile.

Chu Feng hadn’t noticed it because he had been guarded against her during their first meeting, but now that he had dropped his vigilance a little, he felt a surge of warmth from her gentle gaze. She really saw him as kin.

The usually fearless Chu Feng was unsure how he should treat his aunt.

Jie Tiannian sensed Chu Feng’s internal struggle. She lifted the kettle and poured it into a bowl before offering it to him.

“Drink this and train in the bamboo forest.”

This bowl of water emanated a faint fragrance, as it was boiled with countless natural oddities. Jie Tiannian had specially prepared it for him.

She also had a lot of confidence in Chu Feng, as she hadn’t bothered to explain about the bamboo forest. It was as if she had expected him to see through it.

“Thanks.” Chu Feng took the bowl and gulped the water down.

Now that he had drunk the water, he could better smell the scent coming from the bamboo forest. The scent was indeed an excellent cultivation resource.

“Go on, but don’t go overboard. Training and rest must go hand in hand. Return here in a day,” Jie Tiannian instructed.

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded before walking into the bamboo forest.

He headed to the area where the scent was the most concentrated. He sat down with crossed legs before taking out the cultivation resources she had previously given him.

He could also use the Totem Nine Daoists’ cultivation resources here, but the ones given by Jie Tiannian better complemented the environment here.

Chu Feng took in the scent of the bamboo forest while assimilating the cultivation resources.

A day passed.

He hadn’t even assimilated a tenth of the cultivation resources he had obtained from Jie Tiannian, but he had already made a breakthrough, advancing from Immortal Dragon God-cloak to Exalted Dragon God-cloak. He was just a step away from reaching pinnacle God-cloak.

Chu Feng sensed that he could reach pinnacle God-cloak, Saint Dragon God-cloak with the cultivation resources he had acquired, but he didn’t continue cultivating as he recalled Jie Tiannian’s reminder for him to rest after training for a day.

Thus, he opened his eyes.

Now that he was in a more relaxed state, he was surprised to notice that he was feeling weak. This could have been a side effect of him taking in the bamboo forest’s aura. On top of that, he realized that a huge portion of the previously lush bamboo forest had started to wither.

“Is this due to my cultivation?”

Chu Feng finally understood why Jie Tiannian had instructed him to rest. Neither the side effect from cultivating here nor the withering of the bamboo leaves was desirable.

If he continued cultivating, all of the bamboo trees around him might have died.

Whoosh!

A purple torrential rain suddenly fell from the sky, and the withered bamboo slowly recovered.

Chu Feng knew that this was Jie Tiannian’s means. He could tell that the purple torrential rain was made out of invaluable treasures. Thus, he stood up and dragged his weakened body back to the bamboo hut.

It took time for his fatigue to settle in. He didn’t feel that tired at first, but his footsteps grew heavier and heavier. It should have been a short journey back to the bamboo hut, but he felt like he had walked for a long time.

Fortunately, he finally arrived at the bamboo hut.

The doors to the bamboo hut were open, allowing him to see inside from a distance away.

The bamboo hut wasn’t big. There was a small bamboo table with several delicious-looking dishes placed in the middle of the hut.

Jie Tiannian was cooking more dishes, but she was cooking like a mortal instead of using formations.

“You’re on time. I’m about to be done with my final dish.” Jie Tiannian flashed a radiant smile at Chu Feng before resuming her frying.

As he sat down on one of the chairs around the table, the final dish was plated and brought out.

Jie Tiannian’s cooking skills were impressive. The fragrance was enough to stoke Chu Feng’s appetite. It could have been because he was exhausted, but the delicacies looked particularly alluring. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At the same time, Chu Feng was left feeling rather conflicted. It was warm.

Many people had shown him goodwill throughout his long journey, but none had stoked the same feeling as what Jie Tiannian gave him. He felt like he was thoroughly taken care of.

“I don’t know about your preferences, but your mother loved these dishes, so I thought you might enjoy them too,” Jie Tiannian said.

“Aunt, is my mother doing well?” Chu Feng finally asked the question that had been lingering on his mind.
