Chapter 3868 - Seeking Riches From Danger

Although Chu Feng’s spirit power and perseverance were indeed outstanding, his body also began to tremble as time continued to pass.

Finally, Chu Feng opened his eyes.

At the instant Chu Feng opened his eyes, his strand of spirit power that was tied to the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast was severed.

“Huu~~~”

After severing the connection, Chu Feng took several deep breaths to stabilize his condition. His body then gradually stopped trembling.

At the same time as Chu Feng was doing that, the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast began to shatter. Then, it turned into a pile of dust and soil that scattered all over the ground.

Evidently, the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast had lost its effect, and had turned into useless soil.

That said, the Mystic Cave Saints were completely unaffected by what had happened to the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast. Instead, they surrounded Chu Feng. “Brother Asura, are you alright? Did you manage to sense anything?”

“Sure enough, this place is extremely dangerous,” said Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, exactly what did you manage to sense?” asked the Mystic Cave Saints again.

“The reek of blood, killing intent and overwhelming power. Those things fill both sides of the cave,” said Chu Feng.

“Sure enough, this place is too dangerous. It’s not a place we can handle. Big brother, we should quickly leave this place,” the others from the Mystic Cave Saints all began to urge their eldest brother to retreat from the tomb.

Even though they had not been able to differentiate the dangers of the tomb as clearly as Chu Feng had, they had still managed to sense the terrifying aura emitted by it during their short period of connection with the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast.

Because of that, they were already very certain of how dangerous it was.

Within this place was power they could not conquer. If they continued to stay here, they might encounter fatal dangers.

“We’ve gone through great difficulty to enter this place, are you all willing to leave just like this?” asked Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, as the saying goes, should the green mountain remain, there will always be wood to burn. It is better to preserve our lives.” [1. This chinese idiom is equivalent to the saying ‘where there’s life, there’s hope.’]

“While it’s true that we also want the treasures of this place, no matter how important those treasures might be, they will not be as important as our lives," said the Mystic Cave Saints.

“But it is also said that riches can only be sought from dangers. Since we’ve entered this place, we should at least scout it out, no? Are you all really planning to leave empty-handed like this?” asked Chu Feng.

“This...”

The Mystic Cave Saints started to hesitate. They did not know how to respond to Chu Feng’s question.

After being quiet for a long while, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints finally asked, “Brother Asura, how confident are you in your concealment formation?”

He asked that question so that he could know what the odds were of them not being discovered by the terrifying existences in this place.

If the odds were high, they would be able to stay. If the odds were low, they would naturally have to leave at once.

“I don’t have any confidence. I can only say that it’s a gamble.”

“Furthermore, although both paths are filled with dangerous auras, they’re different.”

“One side’s dangerous aura is weaker. In other words, that side should be relatively less dangerous. We can proceed towards that side.”

“Are you all willing to accompany me? If not, you can return to that world spirit space and wait for me. I will return to find you later,” Chu Feng said to the Mystic Cave Saints.

“I will accompany you,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“What about you all?” Chu Feng looked to the others from the Mystic Cave Saints.

They sighed. “Since our big brother has decided to accompany you, we no longer have a choice. Regardless of life or death, we’ll have to go on this journey together,” the others from the Mystic Cave Saints appeared somewhat helpless as they said those words.

Chu Feng was able to sense that they were truly unwilling to continue with the exploration. It was only because their eldest brother was willing to accompany him that they had decided to continue onward too.

They really did appear like a bunch that would rather stick together in hard times and go through trials and tribulations together.

Because of that, Chu Feng’s impression of the Mystic Cave Saints slightly improved again.

After making their decision, they immediately set off towards the direction indicated by Chu Feng.

They had only journeyed for a short while when they discovered a gigantic complete skeleton.

The bones were incomparably enormous. That skeleton was over a thousand meters tall, and reached several tens of thousands of meters in length.

Needless to say, it was a truly colossal skeleton.

Through the skeleton, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were able to have a rough impression of what that colossus looked like when it was alive.

It was an extremely ugly yet ferocious giant beast.

As for that giant beast, it was a sort of beast that neither Chu Feng or the Mystic Cave Saints had ever seen.

Furthermore, the giant beast’s skeleton emitted the aura of the Ancient Era.

Yet, it was clear that that giant beast had died not too long ago.

All of its bones were badly damaged. All of its flesh had been gnawed clean. Even its Source Energy had been absorbed completely.

All of this served to show that that enormous beast from the Ancient Era, that beast that had managed to live all the way until that moment, had been eaten by someone or something.

However, as its Source Energy had simply been absorbed too cleanly, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to determine how powerful the enormous beast had been when it was alive.

That said, they were certain that it had been extremely powerful. Thus, what sort of existence could possibly eat it?

A human? The possibility of that being the case seemed to be rather slim.

“Roar~~~”

At the moment when they were pondering, a roar was suddenly heard.

That was the roar of a ferocious beast. It was so loud and resounding that it shook the entire region, and caused the cave to tremble violently.

Furthermore, that ferocious beast was very far from their location. This meant that it was very powerful.

But, the roar that it had emitted was a blood-curdling screech, a miserable shriek.

“Boom~~~”

Following that, clamors sounded nonstop. Like a torrential storm, the clamoring rushed towards Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints from far away.

The intense wind wreaked havoc in its path, and lifted piles of debris composed of rocks and dust. Those were energy ripples!

Those were energy ripples caused by a battle.

“Damn it!”

Seeing the incoming energy ripples, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints immediately stood before Chu Feng and others.

Chu Feng noticed that a shield had appeared in his hand.

That shield flickered with a golden light. After he tossed it out, the shield immediately grew in size. Like a bastion of steel, it sealed away the entire cave, shielding Chu Feng and the others behind it.

That shield was a treasure from the Ancient Era. Chu Feng could tell that the shield possessed an extremely powerful defense.

Likely, not even the attack of a rank one Utmost Exalted would be able to cause any damage to it.

“Clank~~~”

However, in the next moment, a loud sound was heard, and that incomparably powerful shield instantly changed shape.

It was the impact from the energy ripples.

Following that, enormous cracks extended throughout the shield.

Seeing that, panic appeared on Chu Feng’s face.

It seemed that even that extremely powerful shield would not be able to hold back the energy ripples.

“Boom~~~”

In the next instant, the shield shattered.

Sure enough, that shield, powerful as it was, was unable to withstand the energy ripples that came from far away.

However, the shield was, after all, a treasure.

After it shattered, it turned into light that enveloped Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints.

Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were soon engulfed by the energy ripples. Like ants that had fallen into surging river waters, they were powerless to resist, and could only drift with the flow.

After being sent flying for a very long time, the energy ripples finally dissipated. It was only then that Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints landed on the ground and regained the freedom to move.

Although the energy ripples were extremely powerful, they were fortunate to have been protected by the light that the shield had turned into. Because of that, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were uninjured.

“Let’s go.”

After standing up, Chu Feng turned around without any hesitation and ran towards the direction they’d come from.

“Brother Asura, where are you going?”

The voices of the Mystic Cave Saints sounded from behind him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“We cannot stay here. We must quickly return to that spirit formation world,” panic was present in Chu Feng’s voice.

“Brother Asura, didn’t you say that riches could only be sought from dangers?” asked the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Sought my ass! Should the green mountain remain, there will always be wood to burn! We can talk further after preserving our lives first!” shouted Chu Feng.
