Chapter 4996: Gaze

There were two silhouettes standing opposite to the humanoid monster, one tall and one short. They wore a red robe and a red veil, which seemed to possess the ability to blur their appearances.

“It looks like you have left the underground world for far too long. Is it because you have possessed that wolf beast’s body? From the looks of it now, it must have been due to you that the wolf beast was able to make a name for itself in the Nine Souls Galaxy,” the tall man said.

“Since you have heard everything I’ve said, I shan’t beat around the bush. Indeed, the wolf beast was only able to reach where he was due to my guidance,” the humanoid monster replied.

He had noticed that the two red-robed figures were incredibly powerful, so he chose to adopt a respectful attitude.

“You sure know how to make things sound nice. I’ve taken a closer look at it earlier, and the wolf beast’s soul power only became assimilable due to external intervention. You claimed possession of his body and took over his everything. He was nothing but your puppet.

“Your possession not only robbed him of his freedom but his life as well. That’s why his soul was reduced to such a state. You needed a puppet to travel freely in the world of cultivation. If your puppet dies, you have no choice but to revert to your original body.

“You knew that there were beings from the Ancient Era living here, so you chose to travel here. You were the one who spread the story about the wolf beast, hoping to attract those whom you deem qualified to become your next puppet,” the tall red-robed man said.

“Why are you asserting such falsehoods on me? We don’t know each other, so why are you painting me out to be the evil one here? What proof do you have?” the humanoid monster asked.

“Heh… Well, I don’t have any proof. It’s all my conjecture, but I believe in my judgment,” the tall red-robed man said.

“What’s your motive?” the humanoid monster asked.

“I guess I can tell you as much. I came here specifically to look for you, and as for my motive…” The tall red-robed man chuckled softly before continuing on,”… it’s to take your life.”

“You!!!”

The humanoid monster immediately backed away upon hearing those words. Killing intent raged in its eyes.

Shoosh!

The short red-robed man raised his hand and opened his palm. Crimson gaseous flames poured out of his hand, surging toward the sky. It then started spreading to form a crimson dome to seal off the surroundings.

The humanoid monster looked at the crimson dome and frowned.

“I have no grudge with you, and we have never met each other. Why do you want to kill me?” the humanoid monster asked with a pitiful voice.

What he had said was the truth. He had never met the two red-robed men before.

“Do I need a reason to kill you? Just accept your death. Don’t make your final moments look too unseemly,” the tall red-robed man said.

“I was giving you some room to back off, but it looks like you don’t know how to appreciate it!”

Green light gleamed in the eyes of the humanoid monster, and a black aura started surging from his body. Eventually, the humanoid monster turned into a thousand-meters large spider. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He wasn’t anything in the world of cultivation, where humongous beasts could easily reach over ten thousand meters in size. Nevertheless, his size was still towering compared to the two humans.

More importantly, he was giving off overwhelming killing intent and an aura that exceeded that of Martial Exalted level.

If not for the red dome barrier sealing off its aura, Chu Feng and the others would have been shocked by it.

“Do you really think that this Exalted will allow you to trample all over me? I’ll kill you for daring to mess with me!”

The monster flung his tail, and black spider threads shot out off the tip of its tail toward the two red-robed figures. These threads were extremely tough, clearly not made out of ordinary materials.

But when those threads approached those two red-robed figures, they suddenly screeched to a halt, as if they had collided with something. Then, they started falling to the ground.

Upon seeing that, the monster opened its gaping mouth and unleashed a flurry of sharp black teeth that were reminiscent of daggers. Yet, just like the spider threads, they were stopped in mid-air.

“You…”

The monster was taken aback. He finally realized that something was amiss.

“It looks like you don’t want to die a dignified death. There’s no other choice then.”

The tall red-robed man raised his arm and began releasing the same crimson aura as before. It gathered on the surface of his palm and eventually morphed into a compass.

“Sh*t!”

Seeing that the other party was going to launch an attack, the monster quickly dashed toward the red dome barrier, hoping to make a getaway.

Shoosh!

But before he could get far, innumerable crimson hands started pouring out of the compass held by the tall red-robed man. These hands expanded the moment they were released from the compass, and they moved at a terrifying speed. It didn’t take long for them to wrap their hands around the monster.

“Gah!”

The monster let out a bone-chilling cry, but it only lasted for a split moment. Those crimson hands tore his thousand meters wide physique into two mercilessly.

Seeing that, the short red-robed man took out a gourd and uncorked it. The gourd released a powerful suction force that dragged the tattered carcass of the monster into it.

“Young master Feng, looks like it isn’t a wasted trip. The fellow we secured this time around seems pretty unusual,” the short red-robed man remarked.

Meanwhile, the tall red-robed man turned to look at Chu Feng. It just so happened that the latter was looking in their direction, making it seem as if they were exchanging looks.

“Elder Xuan, do you think that man over there is able to see us?” the tall red-robed man asked.

“That man possesses great luck. I wouldn’t be surprised if he wields unusual means. He might be weak at the moment, but there’s a possibility that he might have grasped skills that allows him to see us. Even if that isn’t the case, it’s possible that he might have just sensed something,” the short red-robed man said.

“Interesting.”

The tall red-robed man chuckled with a meaningful smile before turning around to leave, The short red-robed man named Elder Xuan also quickly followed suit.

“Chu Feng, what are you looking at?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster suddenly asked.

She noticed that Chu Feng kept turning his eyes toward a certain direction.

“It’s nothing much. I just feel like… something has happened over there,” Chu Feng said.

He hadn’t discovered anything yet, but his intuition told him that something had happened in that direction. He tried observing it with Heaven’s Eye, but he wasn’t able to find anything.

“You must be exhausted. Take a rest, don’t force yourself,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

“I’m fine,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster didn’t harp on the matter anymore, but she suddenly raised her head to look into the distance. It wasn’t the direction where Chu Feng was looking at earlier but somewhere even further.

It was where the two red-robed figures had disappeared toward earlier.
