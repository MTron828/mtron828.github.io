Chapter 5367: Making a Fool of Myself

“I have never heard about him either, but he must be a highly powerful cultivator, considering how he was able to see through the crux of young miss’ martial skill. Is he from the Bloodline Galaxy?”

The woman in the purple dress voiced her thoughts aloud. She had become curious about Chu Feng as well.

“Didn’t he mention earlier that he’s going to cultivate? Why don’t we go take a look?” the young woman suggested.

“That’s a great idea! Young miss, let’s go!”

The woman in the purple dress nodded in agreement. She opened up her palm, revealing a huge bunch of bamboo slips that practically had every floor number.

…

Meanwhile, Jie Yu had also entered the first floor of the tower.

“I saw Yao Luo earlier. Is Ling Sheng’er here too?” Jie Yu asked.

“That’s right, young master Jie Yu. Young miss Ling Sheng’er is cultivating a martial skill,” the elder said.

“That little demon king is here too?” Jie Yu worriedly frowned. “It’ll be troublesome if Chu Feng bumps into her.”

“That isn’t a problem. Young miss Ling Sheng’er is cultivating on the 24th floor, whereas young master Chu Feng can only access up to the 20th floor,” the elder said.

“That’s a relief,” Jie Yu replied.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already reached the 30th floor. It was not that he was satisfied with the 30th floor, but this was the highest floor that facilitated the cultivation of martial skills. The floors beyond that were reserved for learning formations and world spiritist techniques.

Chu Feng walked up to a row of copper figurines and drew the Immemorial Hero’s Sword. Then, he closed his eyes.

The spirit formation gate behind him flickered, and two silhouettes walked out. They were the young woman and the woman in the purple dress.

The young woman was none other than Ling Sheng’er, whereas the woman in the purple dress was her personal maid, Yao Luo.

It would be a grave mistake to underestimate Yao Luo just because she was Ling Sheng’er’s personal maid. Her clan wielded tremendous say in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and she was a prodigy too. She only willingly served Ling Sheng’er because the latter was far more outstanding than her in terms of talent and standing.

“He really is here to cultivate a martial skill,” Yao Luo remarked.

“Shh!”

Ling Sheng’er placed her forefinger before her mouth, signaling Yao Luo to keep quiet. She quietly made her way to the corner of the room, and Yao Luo followed her.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Of the two, Yao Luo appeared much more excited. She thought that only a formidable prodigy could have offered useful advice to her young miss within such a short period of time.

“Young miss, do you think that he’ll succeed?” Yao Luo asked.

Even Ling Sheng’er, despite being a prodigious martial cultivator, could only cultivate on the 24th floor, but Chu Feng actually came all the way up to the 30th floor. If he really could absorb the energy on the 30th floor, it could only mean that he was an incredible cultivator.

“Who knows? Let’s wait and see,” Ling Sheng’er said.

Time ticked by, but Chu Feng remained motionless on the spot.

“Why isn’t he moving?” Yao Luo asked.

“Let me take a look.” Ling Sheng’er’s eyes turned purple.

Moments later, she exclaimed in shock, “He’s rapidly absorbing the energy here!”

“What? Is he able to take in that much energy?” Yao Luo was stunned.

There was no question that the energy on the 30th floor was highly beneficial to cultivating martial skills, but the cultivator would have to be powerful enough to exert control over it. Otherwise, they would risk losing control of their cultivation and go berserk.

Most cultivators would have controlled the rate at which they absorbed the energy lest they endangered themselves, but Chu Feng neglected to exercise any self-restraint here. Just how strong must his control be to actually harness so much power at once?

That only further stoked Yao Luo’s anticipation.

She even made sure to remain absolutely silent lest she disturb him, a contrast from how she had behaved when they first met.

Two hours passed in a flash.

Chu Feng had already stopped absorbing the surrounding energy an hour ago, but even so, he hadn’t budged at all since then.

“Young miss, could it be that he isn’t cultivating a martial skill but some kind of special cultivation skill?” Yao Luo asked.

“He should be cultivating a martial skill, or else there’s no reason for him to wield a sword,” Ling Sheng’er replied.

“But why isn’t he moving at all? No one in the world cultivates a martial skill like that.” Yao Luo was confused.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng’s aura began to flow out.

“He’s a rank one Half-God level cultivator?” Yao Luo remarked in disappointment.

To be fair, it was formidable for someone as young as Chu Feng to reach rank one Half-God level, but it was nothing much to boast about in powerhouses like the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Such a level was far from enough to meet Yao Luo’s expectations.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng suddenly opened his eyes and swung his sword, releasing a sword qi.

A second later, the sword qi suddenly vanished.

“He failed?” Yao Luo asked in confusion.

Bam bam bam bam!

The copper figurines lined up in front of Chu Feng suddenly exploded. As it turned out, the sword qi had reappeared and even multiplied severalfold. This was the rank nine Exalted Taboo, Exalted Taboo Shadow Severing Hack!

It was powerful, discreet, and could be used on multiple targets at once. If used well, it could catch the opponent by surprise and breach their defense.

“Young misses, I’m surprised that you’re free to spend so much time watching me.”

Chu Feng turned to look at the two women. He had already noticed them from the moment they stepped out of the spirit formation gate.

“You’re Chu Feng, right? Did you just grasp that martial skill or are you training it?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

“I have only just grasped it,” Chu Feng replied.

“Liar! How could you have only just grasped it?”

Yao Luo refused to believe Chu Feng’s words. She could sense just how powerful the martial skill he had executed was. The fact that it was much more powerful than most rank nine Exalted Taboos she had seen before meant that he must have already mastered it.

How could someone master a martial skill that quickly?

“If you don’t believe me, you may assume that I have already practiced it for a long time.”

Chu Feng couldn’t be bothered to argue with Yao Luo, especially since he didn’t have a good impression of her.

Ling Sheng’er eyes glimmered in contemplation. Moments later, she looked at Chu Feng with widened eyes and asked, “Could it be that you simulated the martial skill in your mind till you mastered it?”

“Young miss, you sure are knowledgeable,” Chu Feng replied.

Yao Luo clicked her tongue and scoffed, “Braggart. Only someone with vast experience can possibly simulate a martial skill in his mind till he masters it. No junior can possibly do that, even with the help of this tower. I might believe it if you’re tens of thousands of years old, but you’re just taking us for fools here!”

Ignoring Yao Luo, Chu Feng turned to Ling Sheng’er and asked, “Young miss, did you try out my advice?”

“I did, and it worked out well. I came here to thank you for that. I am Ling Sheng’er. May I know who invited you here?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

“So, it’s Miss Ling Sheng’er. Well… you can say that I came uninvited,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

It was the truth, considering that he wouldn’t have been able to enter the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s territory if not for Old Man Zhou’s broken sword.

“You are a humorous guy,” Ling Sheng’er replied.

She didn’t believe Chu Feng’s words, for she knew that outsiders couldn’t have entered this place without any connections.

“Are you a world spiritist too?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

“I am,” Chu Feng replied.

“What level are you at?”

“White Dragon God-cloak.”

“White Dragon God-cloak?” Yao Luo widened her eyes in astonishment.

She didn’t think that it was a big deal for Chu Feng to be a rank one Half-God level cultivator, but it would be a different matter if he was a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist on top of that.

“I don’t like to owe favors. I am pretty skilled at world spiritist techniques. Since you offered me pointers for my martial skill earlier, I’ll offer you some pointers on your world spiritist techniques too. Follow me,” Ling Sheng’er said.

Without waiting for Chu Feng’s reply, she stepped into the spirit formation gate.

“Haha! That girl actually wants to teach you world spiritist techniques!” Eggy burst into laughter. After all, she had never seen anyone more talented than Chu Feng in world spiritist techniques.

Chu Feng was already rendered speechless. He didn’t think that Ling Sheng’er would be this confident in herself despite her docile appearance.

“What are you waiting for? Let’s go!” Yao Luo urged.

“I’ll pass on it,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you a fool? It’s our young miss we’re talking about here, Ling Sheng’er! It can’t be that you have never heard of our young miss?” Yao Luo asked.

“I’m afraid not,” Chu Feng replied.

“You… How much of a bumpkin are you to have actually never heard of our young miss? You should have at least heard of Lord Jie Ranqing, right?” Yao Luo asked.

“I have,” Chu Feng replied.

“In terms of talents as a world spiritist, our young miss is only second to Lord Jie Ranqing in the history of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion! If you know what’s better for you, you wouldn’t miss out on this opportunity!”

Yao Luo grabbed Chu Feng’s arm and dragged him through the spirit formation gate. While she was doing so, she flashed Chu Feng a smile and said, “I haven’t introduced myself yet. I am Yao Luo.”

The abrupt change in attitude caught Chu Feng off guard, but given how strongly the other party insisted on it, he thought that it would be rude of him to continue turning them down. Besides, it was clear now that Ling Sheng’er was of high standing in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Even though he didn’t need her pointers, there was no harm in getting on good terms with her. She might just know of a way for him to acquire more Life Crystals.

Thus, he stepped into the spirit formation gate and ascended to the 31st floor.

Chu Feng had been to this floor earlier, which was how he knew that it was reserved for practicing formations and world spiritist techniques. Ling Sheng’er was already waiting for him there.

“Chu Feng, construct a formation,” Ling Sheng’er said.

Yao Luo excused herself to the side, though her eyes remained focused on Chu Feng. She was keen to offer him some advice too.

“What formation should I construct?” Chu Feng asked.

“Anything will do,” Ling Sheng’er replied.

Chu Feng waved his hand and instantaneously constructed an offensive formation.

Both Yao Luo and Ling Sheng’er froze in place. They could tell just how powerful the offensive formation Chu Feng had constructed at a whim was.

There was a brief moment of silence before Ling Sheng’er’s lips curled into a sweet smile. “What a close shave. I nearly made a fool of myself.”
