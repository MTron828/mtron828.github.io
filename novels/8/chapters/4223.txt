Chapter 4223 - Aiming For Chu Feng?

The inside of the palace hall was a complete mess. But, there didn’t seem to have been a fierce battle.

It looked more like an enormous power had swept through the palace hall.

As for Zhao Hong, she was nowhere to be seen.

“Lady Zhao Hong?!”

Han Xiu was so terrified that her face had turned deathly pale. She was at a complete loss.

Han Xiu started shouting for Zhao Hong, and began searching everywhere.

However, she was unable to find any sign of Zhao Hong. Only her aura was still present in the palace hall.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that even though there were signs of destruction inside the palace hall, there was no blood to be seen.

“Senior, you can stop searching. Zhao Hong must’ve been captured by someone,” said Chu Feng.

“Captured?”

“But, who would capture Lady Zhao Hong?”

“Since Lady Zhao Hong has just returned, she does not have any major enemies.”

“As for the enemies that she had, they are simply no match for her.”

It wasn’t that Han Xiu had never thought of Zhao Hong being captured.

It was simply that she was unable to think of a person who would capture her.

After all, the people that had the motive to do so were all no match for her.

“Could it be those people?”

“Could it be the Cloudsky Immortal Sect?” Han Xiu asked all of a sudden.

The Cloudsky Immortal Sect were the people that had captured Yin Zhuanghong back then.

Furthermore, the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had some conflict with the Red-dress Holy Land that day.

“It would seem that senior has also investigated the identity of those people,” said Chu Feng.

When the people from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had arrived at the Red-dress Holy Land, they had not shown their faces.

Han Xiu, Chu Feng and that others had had no idea who they were.

Chu Feng had only learned who they were after asking Long Daozhi.

It was then that he had learned that it had been people from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect that had captured Yin Zhuanghong.

Since Han Xiu also knew their identity, it meant that she had also investigated them.

“They’ve captured Zhuanghong. I cannot sit and watch whilst remaining indifferent.”

“If it was truly them who did this, why did they only capture Lady Zhao Hong? Why didn’t they take care of all of us?”

“They were clearly capable of eradicating our entire Red-dress Holy Land.”

Han Xiu was frowning and pondering nonstop.

“Could it be that Lian Xi?”

“Could he have come for retaliation out of personal motives?”

After pondering for a long while, that was the only person Zhao Hong could think of.

Lian Xi was also from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.

When the people from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had come to capture Yin Zhuanghong, Lian Xi had been the one standing at the forefront.

His contempt toward the Red-dress Holy Land and the others had been the most obvious.

Furthermore, he had fought against Zhao Hong.

In their simple match, Zhao Hong had held an absolute advantage.

If it wasn’t for the interference of other experts from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Lian Xi would have continued to fight Zhao Hong.

As such, everyone was able to tell that he harbored a grudge against her.

The Cloudsky Immortal Sect had been capable of flattening the entire Red-dress Holy Land that day. But, they didn’t do so. Instead, they had only captured Yin Zhuanghong. That showed that the Cloudsky Immortal Sect did not have any desire to wipe out the Red-dress Holy Land.

As such, Lian Xi would be the only person who could possibly want to take care of Zhao Hong.

“Indeed, it’s possible that he was the one that did this.”

“But, that doesn’t eliminate other possibilities either.”

Chu Feng had thought the same thing as Han Xiu.

But, he was more worried about Zhao Hong’s safety.

If Zhao Hong had truly fallen into the hands of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s Lian Xi, things would definitely end disastrously considering Lian Xi’s personality.

Because of that, Chu Feng began to carefully examine the palace hall using his Heaven’s Eyes.

He wanted to find some clues.

If he wanted to find Zhao Hong, he needed substantial proof and clues. He couldn’t rely on mere guesses.

His top priority was to find Zhao Hong.

“There’s a spirit formation?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

He had detected something.

It was a sort of power hidden within the palace hall.

However, after examining it closely, Chu Feng discovered that it was not a spirit formation, but rather a gathering of martial power.

Once Chu Feng detected it, that power immediately bubbled out. It turned into several large characters that floated in midair in the palace hall.

“Chu Feng, from today on, you are not allowed to disguise yourself.”

“Else, not only will Zhao Hong die, all of your Chu Heavenly Clansmen will die too!”

Those words lasted but an instant before disappearing.

After disappearing, they turned into frantic power that engulfed the entire palace hall.

That power did not attack Chu Feng and Han Xiu.

But, they were able to clearly sense how powerful it was.

That power was capable of obliterating everything.

Not only was it able to easily kill Chu Feng and Han Xiu, it was also able to level the entire Red-dress Holy Land in an instant.

It was capable of making everyone in the Red-dress Holy Land disappear from the world.

The power was warning Chu Feng and Han Xiu that it was capable of acting on its threat.

As the power was only a warning, it did not last long before disappearing.

Although the words had only been present for a short instant, they were caught by both Chu Feng and Han Xiu, and were engraved into their hearts. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Especially Chu Feng. The sudden sense of guilt and astonishment made him unable to calm his emotions.

Never would he have imagined that Zhao Hong’s calamity had been caused by him.

It was so much so that even the Chu Heavenly Clan was being threatened!

But, exactly who was the culprit?

Furthermore, why were they doing such a thing?

Regardless of who it might be, the possibility of it having been done by the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had grown very small.

Chu Feng was also able to confirm that the person who had captured Zhao Hong was extremely powerful.

“Chu Feng, did you offend someone?” Han Xiu asked Chu Feng.

Likely because she had been terrified by the power from earlier, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster’s voice was actually trembling with fear.

Her reaction was understandable.

The power that had appeared earlier was simply too terrifying.

Even for Han Xiu, she had rarely ever felt something so powerful.

“I have indeed offended people. However, among the people that I’ve offended, there shouldn’t be anyone that knows of my relationship with Zhao Hong.”

“This person seems to know me very well.”

“Exactly who could it be?”

Chu Feng pondered nonstop. However, he was unable to think of a person that was capable of doing such a thing among the people that he had offended.

Furthermore, he couldn’t find anyone that powerful among those people either.

“Regardless of who did it, it at least means that Lady Zhao Hong is still alive.”

“This could be considered to be great fortune within misfortune.”

“Chu Feng, you shouldn’t blame yourself either. If it’s a blessing, it wouldn’t be a disaster. If it is a disaster, we wouldn’t be able to avoid it either.”

“Since this person was aiming for you, they will definitely seek you out sooner or later.”

“Furthermore, somehow I feel that this person does not possess an extremely deep hostility toward you.”

“Else, they could’ve just killed you directly. There was no reason for them to threaten you.”

Han Xiu did not blame Chu Feng after learning of Zhao Hong’s disappearance. Instead, she began to comfort him.

As for Chu Feng, he didn’t say anything. He was still pondering.

He actually also felt the situation to be very strange.

It was as Han Xiu had said. Since that person knew him so well, they could’ve easily taken care of him themself.

If they wanted to make Chu Feng blame himself, they could’ve directly killed Zhao Hong. The result of doing that would be clearly better than what they’d done.

Thus, why would they insist on doing it?

What benefit was there for them in doing it?

“Regardless of who it might be and what their purpose might be, you cannot use the disguise of Asura from now on.”

“You can only face the world as Chu Feng,” said Han Xiu.

“Mn. Truth be told, it was not my intention to disguise myself.”

“I was afraid that the people close to me would be implicated by me. That was the reason for my disguise.”

“Now that I can only protect those I care for by using my true identity, I will naturally no longer disguise myself.”

Even though he knew that Zhao Hong was not dead and had only been captured to threaten him, Chu Feng still felt uneasy. His heart had been suspended the entire time.

It was unknown what the person who had captured Zhao Hong planned to do. But, they possessed strength capable of obliterating Chu Feng instantly.

Chu Feng felt as if he was being controlled by that person. Should they be willing, he would become their plaything.

Regardless of whether that person might be a friend or a foe, the feeling of being controlled by someone else was extremely uncomfortable for Chu Feng.
