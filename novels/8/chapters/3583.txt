Chapter 3583 - The Furious Clan Chief

At the beginning, the crowd abided by the rules, and the bodies of light went to the person who was closest to where they appeared.

However, soon, people became discontent, and started to scramble for the bodies of light.

Who would possibly be willing to allow what belonged to them to be snatched away by others? Thus, it was unavoidable that people would begin fighting.

Tantai Yinjian, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief had all entered a special training state. Thus, they were simply unable to hear what was happening outside.

On top of that, the elders from the other powers were also filled with selfishness, and wanted to obtain more cultivation opportunities. Thus, they too joined the fray.

Because of that, the previously peaceful Sacred Palace Hall became completely chaotic.

It was one thing for people from the other powers to join this fray. After all, the world of martial cultivators was a world where the weak were prey to the strong. They were all already accustomed to it.

However, when such a scramble reached the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen reacted with enormous discontent.

After all, it was all thanks to Chu Feng that the crowd were able to enter that place. Not only were they not showing gratefulness, but they even came to snatch cultivation resources from their Chu Heavenly Clan.

With the situation being like that, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen exploded with anger.

However, after their greed was completely invoked and clouded their sense of reason, what the Chu Heavenly Clansmen obtained was not gratefulness. Instead, they received a bitter lesson.

“Damn it, damn it...”

Furious shouts were sounding nonstop. Unfortunately, no one heard them. The reason for that was because that voice came from Chu Feng.

Although Chu Feng was in a place of nothingness, he was able to see everything that was occurring in the palace hall.

All of it was being fully witnessed by Chu Feng.

Seeing his clansmen being bullied and humiliated, Chu Feng felt endless anger.

Unfortunately for him, with the current state that he was in, he was unable to do anything. He also did not know how to leave that place of nothingness and enter the Sacred Palace Hall.

This caused him to feel extremely furious and powerless. Because of that, his mood was extremely bad.

“What are you being so emotional for? Our fusion will soon be complete. Just tolerate it for a bit longer,” right at that moment, the little girl’s voice sounded by Chu Feng’s ears.

Chu Feng reacted as if he had seen his savior upon hearing the little girl’s voice. Immediately, he said, “Child, let me get in there. I cannot look on indifferently as my clansmen are bullied and humiliated by others.”

Chu Feng knew very well that the little girl was not only able to let him enter the Sacred Palace Hall, but she was also able to stop it all. After all, the little girl was so very strong.

“That wouldn’t do. I am currently fusing with you. You’re not allowed to move at this time. Otherwise, all my effort will have gone to waste,” the little girl’s voice sounded again.

“Child, I beg of you,” Chu Feng spoke with a deeply requesting tone.

“There’s really nothing I can do about you,” the little girl sighed helplessly.

“Rumble~~~”

After the little girl said those words, the Sacred Palace Hall started to tremble.

To be exact, it was an overwhelmingly violent shake. It was like a very powerful earthquake.

The violent tremble startled many of the people in the Sacred Palace Hall.

The completely chaotic crowd all stopped their scrambling and stood there, stunned.

One must know that the fighting between the crowd had grown fiercer and fiercer as they fought over the cultivation resources. However, no matter what sort of attack they used, they were unable to shake the Sacred Palace Hall.

And now, the Sacred Palace Hall had trembled violently. This made them realize that the situation was very possibly not simple at all.

Most importantly of all, the violent trembling startled the people that were completely focused on training on the stone chairs awake.

“What are you all doing?!”

When the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief saw the situation in the Sacred Palace Hall, his expression immediately changed. Abruptly, he stood up from the stone chair.

“Utter impudence!!!”

It was not only the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Tantai Yinjian also abruptly stood up as anger filled his face.

They were all people that had experienced a lot of hardships, and witnessed all sorts of things. With merely a glance at the scene below, they knew right away that it was caused by a scramble for cultivation resources.

“Clan Chief Chu, a golden fruit is only able to allow you to ascend onto a Void Seat once. Unless you possess another golden fruit, I’d urge you not to leave your seat.”

A warning voice sounded. It was the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

Hearing those words, the face of Tantai Yinjian, who was originally planning to leave his seat, grew stiff. Then, he quietly pulled back his already extended foot.

However, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief reacted as if he did not hear the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief, and directly flew down from the stone chair.

“Lord Clan Chief, you must uphold justice for us!”

After seeing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan immediately rushed over to his side, howling in grief.

At that moment, anger filled the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s face.

Many Chu Heavenly Clansmen were injured. Chu Xuanzhengfa was even seriously injured, covered in blood and extremely weak. He looked like he was on the verge of dying.

However, he was not the one that was most seriously injured.

Most seriously of all, there were Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were already dead. Some corpses could be seen, whereas some others did not even have corpses remaining. They were beaten so badly that their bodies and souls had been destroyed!!!

“Who is it that injured my clansmen?! Get the hell out here right now!!!”

A voice many times more ear-piercing than thunder exploded in the Sacred Palace Hall.

That voice was so terrifying, so ear-piercing, that many people showed pained looks on their faces.

They all knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was truly enraged.

“This...”

At that moment, no one dared to say anything. After all, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was a peak Exalted-level expert.

“Our clan’s Chu Feng, for the sake of allowing you all to enter this place, went as far as to sacrifice himself. Is this how you repay our clan?!”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked with a stern voice.

The crowd lowered their heads quietly...

They knew that what they had done was wrong. Unfortunately, human nature was a terrifying thing. Not everyone knew how to be grateful, not everyone knew how to repay the kindness given to them...

Before one’s self interest, there were more people that would choose to bite the hand that fed them... Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

To know right from wrong was one thing. To know how to behave was another thing.

In terms of morality, the people that had attacked the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all knew that what they had done was wrong. However, they still did it.

After all, if one looked at it from another point of view, if one looked at how one should always look out for oneself, them doing this sort of thing for the sake of their self-interest was also correct.
