Chapter 3707 - Fusion

“I have never seen anyone returning alive after entering the Mirror Sea’s Gate of Death,” said that old man.

“Gate of Death?”

Grandmaster Liangqiu’s expression changed greatly upon hearing that name.

He’d known that old man for many years. Thus, he had learned some secrets unknown to anyone else from the old man.

The reason why the Mirror Sea was dangerous was not limited to only the undercurrents that attacked one’s willpower and soul.

The Mirror Sea also possessed many spirit formations.

Some spirit formations possessed the power of isolation, and some possessed enormous destructiveness.

Reportedly, the most dangerous formation among them was a spirit formation gate that emitted an enormous suction force.

Old man Zhu had once called that spirit formation gate the Gate of Death.

The reason for that was because the people that fell into that spirit formation gate would never return.

“Could it be that Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa were sucked into that Gate of Death?” asked Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“That girl’s father was sucked into it. As for that boy, he voluntarily entered it. Likely, he’s trying to save her father.”

“He’s actually truly one of intense loyalty. Unfortunately, he doesn’t know how terrifying the Gate of Death is,” said old man Zhu.

“Because of that, Gu Mingyuan is entering the Mirror Sea again to save them?” Grandmaster Liangqiu came to a sudden realization.

“Naturally. Never would I have imagined for Gu Mingyuan to be such a loyal individual too.”

“It is truly great to be young. You don’t have to fear anything,” the old man said with a faint smile.

“Why didn’t you stop her when you knew what she was intending to do?” Grandmaster Liangqiu had a slight look of blame on his face.

“Did this old man not try to dissuade her against it earlier?” old man Zhu asked.

“What use is dissuasion? You should’ve stopped her. Why didn’t you stop her when you’re clearly capable of doing so? That’s a life!” Grandmaster Liangqiu questioned in a somewhat angry manner.

“Rest assured, with that Battering Gate present, she’s simply unable to approach the Gate of Death.”

“Earlier when I tried to dissuade her, I was merely trying to test her out to see if she was as brave as that boy; if she really dared to attempt to enter the Gate of Death to save them.”

The ‘Battering Gate’ the old man spoke of was the gate that emitted waves nonstop.

What the old man said was completely correct. Without Chu Feng sealing off that Battering Gate, the Battering Gate was once again active.

It was capable of pushing Chu Feng to the seafloor and the Gate of Death.

Likewise, it was capable of pushing Gu Mingyuan back up, making it impossible for her to reach the Gate of Death.

No matter how much she wanted to save Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa, she was unable to do anything.

Most importantly, although the Battering Gate was active the entire time, the Gate of Death had closed.

“Damn it! Damn it!”

Seeing that the Gate of Death had closed and that she was unable to approach it, Gu Mingyuan started to shout with grief and indignation.

Her shouts resonated loudly; even Grandmaster Liangqiu, who was above the Mirror Sea, was able to hear her clearly.

That said, he had no time to concern with Gu Mingyuan. He knew very well that Chu Lingxi did not have much time.

Thus, he must quickly assimilate the Deepsea Pupils with Chu Lingxi’s soul.

However, after trying it for some time, he started to frown.

“Brother Zhu, this seems to be much more complicated than I’ve imagined. Forgive me, but I will have to request your assistance.”

Grandmaster Liangqiu had placed the Deepsea Pupils into Chu Lingxi’s eye sockets.

He was using his abilities to try to fuse them with her. Unfortunately, he discovered that he was unable to fuse them.

Helpless, he turned to old man Zhu for assistance.

“Liangqiu, although you’ve become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, you’re not up to the level of a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist at all.”

Seeing that scene, old man Zhu let out a mocking laugh.

“Please don’t make cutting remarks towards me for now. We must save her first.”

“For the sake of obtaining these Deepsea Pupils, we’ve already paid such an enormous price. If this girl cannot be cured...”

“This old man would not be able to live up to Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa’s sacrifice.”

Compared to the calm and indifference from old man Zhu, Grandmaster Liangqiu became so anxious that he was sweating cold sweat.

Furthermore, he had a look of shame and guilt on his face.

He was the one who had proposed finding the Deepsea Pupils. Thus, he felt that if Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa truly ended up encountering some sort of mishap, he would be the one who had caused it.

Even if no one blamed him for it, his own conscience would still make him feel extremely guilty.

“Whether they live or die has nothing to do with me.”

“Forget it. I’ll give you face and help you this once.”

Old man Zhu laughed. Then, he arrived before Chu Lingxi and placed his palm on her eyes.

When his palm moved away from her eyes, her eyes were closed.

Even though nothing special appeared to have happened to Chu Lingxi, Grandmaster Liangqiu had a stunned expression.

He was able to tell that she had fused with the Deepsea Pupils. Even though their fusion was still not complete, it would only take a short while to complete.

Something that he felt to be very difficult to accomplish was easily accomplished by old man Zhu.

“Old fellow, exactly how powerful are you?” Grandmaster Liangqiu looked to old man Zhu with a complicated expression.

“I’m afraid that my strength will surpass your imagination,” old man Zhu was not at all modest towards Grandmaster Liangqiu’s praise.

“Since you’re so powerful, why don’t you go save Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa?”

Grandmaster Liangqiu’s tone lowered a lot when he said those words. He seemed to be pleading.

He truly did not wish for them to die.

“Liangqiu, that’s being excessive. No matter what, we’ve known each other for many years. You want me to take on such risks just because you don’t want them to die?”

“If I am to enter that Gate of Death and become unable to return, what then?”

“Besides, that Gate of Death has already closed. It’s not so simple to save them,” said old man Zhu.

“Sigh~~~”

Grandmaster Liangqiu had a look of regret on his face.

He felt what old man Zhu said to be very reasonable. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Even though he very much wanted Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa to be saved, he should not ask old man Zhu to brave such risks.

“Liangqiu, you seem to be very fond of that boy? Is he your disciple?” asked old man Zhu.

“That’s what I had hoped for. Unfortunately, Chu Feng is unwilling to become my disciple,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“What? He actually refused you, the strongest world spiritist in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield?” exclaimed old man Zhu.

“Stop with your cutting remarks. You’re the strongest world spiritist,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“I’m not from the Ancestral Martial Starfield. I cannot be counted. Thus, you’re the strongest," said old man Zhu.

Grandmaster Liangqiu had a look of deep concern and worry. He was in no mood to bicker with old man Zhu. Thus, he merely rolled his eyes at him and said no more.

However, old man Zhu was unwilling to let him off the hook, “Liangqiu, stop with all the sighing. That kid is unable to differentiate good from bad, why be so concerned with his life and death?”
