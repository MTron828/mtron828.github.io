Chapter 3719 - Emotional Quarrel

“Those things?!!!”

Seeing such a thing, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Chu Xuanzhengfa were immediately stunned. At the same time, complicated emotions of astonishment and fear mixed together on their faces.

Even Gu Mingyuan had the same look on her face.

After all, those were over ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences.

As people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they all knew what over ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences represented.

Most importantly, not only were the ten thousand plus Utmost Exalted-level existences all behind the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, but they were also half-kneeling in a manner akin to subordinates, where the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was their master.

Most importantly of all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was holding a silver halberd.

The aura of that halberd filled heaven and earth and swept through everything. After the halberd appeared, everything in the world appeared very small and insignificant.

Even a martial cultivator as conceited as Gu Mingyuan felt completely suppressed.

It was as if a ruler had descended upon the world!!!

“Ox-nose, could it be, you’ve obtained the Battle God’s Halberd?” Grandmaster Liangqiu asked with a startled voice.

Even though he was unwilling to believe it, the truth was right before his eyes. Thus, he had no choice but to believe it.

Merely, he was very puzzled as to how the Ox-nosed Old Daoist could possibly obtain such a precious weapon.

“Hehe. To be exact, it was obtained by that boy.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not attempt to take credit for Chu Feng’s achievement, and pointed to Chu Feng, who stood beside him.

“Chu Feng?!”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s answer astonished Grandmaster Liangqiu, Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa even more.

Immediately, their eyes all turned to Chu Feng.

“Actually, I only helped slightly. It was mainly senior Daoist’s contribution.” Chu Feng said in a very modest manner.

Gu Mingyuan suddenly revealed a look of anger. She pointed at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and asked angrily, “Ox-nosed Old Daoist, did you exploit Chu Feng?!”

“Alas, what do you mean by that? How could I exploit him?”

“I merely came into an agreement with him beforehand where the Battle God’s Halberd would belong to me should he successfully retrieve it.”

“Of course... I wouldn’t have him exert himself for free. I will be presenting him with benefits too.” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“What sort of benefit could you possibly give him?!” Gu Mingyuan asked angrily. She was very emotional and very furious. She was acting like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had done something to take advantage of Chu Feng.

“Senior Daoist has agreed to help me fuse with my Divine Power,” said Chu Feng.

“What?!”

Hearing those words, both Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu revealed an identical expression.

It was an expression of feeling things turning very bad.

“Ox-nosed Old Daoist, you dared to deceive Chu Feng?! I’m going to kill you!”

Not only did Gu Mingyuan become even more furious, but she had also released her own Utmost Exalted-level oppressive might. Judging from her appearance, she was planning to fight the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Rooooarrr~~~”

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

At practically the same time, the ten thousand plus Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits all moved. They took on an offensive posture and surrounded Gu Mingyuan.

It seemed like the ten thousand plus Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits would immediately unleash full-on attacks at her should she attempt anything.

“Gu Mingyuan, I know that you’re very arrogant, despotic and unreasonable.”

“However, I currently hold the Battle God’s Halberd in my hand.”

“This Battle God’s Halberd is capable of controlling these guardian spirits. If you plan to fight me, you’d best make careful considerations.” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he raised the Battle God’s Halberd.

“Humph, you think trash like these could stop me?”

However, faced with over ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits, Gu Mingyuan showed no sign of fear.

“Senior, I voluntarily agreed to cooperate with senior Daoist. He did not force me, and did not deceive me.”

Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng hurriedly stood before Gu Mingyuan to stop her. He was afraid that they would really end up fighting.

“Chu Feng, if this Ox-nosed Old Daoist is truly capable of granting you Divine Power, I will naturally have no complaints.”

“However, you don’t understand him. This Ox-nosed Old Daoist is simply incapable of fusing Divine Power into anyone’s body at all. No one could possibly be capable of that.”

“This Ox-nosed bastard has deceived others using this sort of thing countless times.”

“It is one thing for him to deceive others, yet he’s actually deceiving you too. With this, how could I possibly tolerate him?” said Gu Mingyuan.

“Young friend Chu Feng, what Gu Mingyuan said is correct.”

At that moment, even Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke. Then, he looked to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. With anger, he said, “Ox-nose, no matter what, you are young friend Chu Feng’s senior, how could you deceive him like this?”

“Deceive? This old man has never deceived anyone.”

“Merely, fusing with Divine Power is going against the rule of nature to begin with. It is extremely difficult to accomplish.”

“For those people to fail to accomplish it, it could only mean that they lacked aptitude. However, this old man has indeed helped someone fuse with Divine Power before.” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“You said you’d succeeded. Very well, why don’t you tell us who you helped with fuse Divine Power successfully?” said Gu Mingyuan.

“That person refused to let me say his name. Thus, I am unable to tell you who that person is.” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“You’re unable to successfully fuse Divine Power with anyone, and are unable to provide a single case of success. Are you still refusing to admit that you’re a scam?” asked Gu Mingyuan. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I myself know my own skills best. Why would I bother to make you all understand what I’m capable of?”

Faced with Gu Mingyuan’s repeated questions, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist revealed a look of indifference. He seemed to be indicating that she could think of him however she wished.

“You damned scam, you’re looking for a beating!”

Gu Mingyuan was so furious that her face had turned completely red. As she spoke, she prepared to attack the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Grandmaster Liangqiu, Senior Gu, I know that the two of you are thinking for my good.”

“However, I feel that senior Daoist will not deceive me. I believe him.”

Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng spoke again.

Even if Chu Feng didn’t believe anyone else, he wouldn’t possibly refuse to believe his father.

Since it was his father who had mentioned to him that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was capable of fusing Divine Power into one’s body, Chu Feng firmly believed that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was capable of such a feat.

Chu Feng even felt that the reason why others did not believe the Ox-nosed Old Daoist must be because they had some sort of misunderstanding about him.

“Chu Feng, you...”

Seeing that Chu Feng was so firm in believing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and not them, Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu both felt very helpless and even slightly angry.

“Chu Feng, since you’re unwilling to listen, you can give it a try yourself.”

“I will supervise this old thing for you so that he will not attempt to run away.”

“Have him teach you how to fuse with Divine Power before my eyes.”

“Once you discover that he has deceived you, tell me about it.”

“At that time, I will help you teach him a lesson.”

Although she was angry, Gu Mingyuan did not give up on Chu Feng, and was still planning to stand up for him.

Seeing Gu Mingyuan like that, Chu Feng felt very moved.

Whether or not she believed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was her business.

However, Gu Mingyuan was making considerations for Chu Feng’s good from the bottom of her heart.
