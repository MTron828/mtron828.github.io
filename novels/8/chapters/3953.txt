Chapter 3953 - The Correct Path

Chu Feng was fleeing far away with Linghu Yueyue and the others.

He only stopped when he felt like he had reached a relatively safe location.

En route, he informed Linghu An’an and the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster of the situation inside the lake. Because of that, they knew that Mount Ivory Valley was currently very dangerous, and that they could not return there.

“What’s your plan from here?” Chu Feng asked Linghu Yueyue.

“I plan to follow Lady Headmaster and reestablish the Whiteclothes Nunnery,” said Linghu Yueyue.

“Yueyue, An’an, there’s no need to reestablish the Whiteclothes Nunnery. I’m already tired. I want to spend the rest of my life on my own,” said the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster.

Even though she had escaped death, she was evidently traumatized by being nearly poisoned to death by her disciples.

“In that case, Lady Headmaster, I will accompany you,” said Linghu Yueyue.

“I’ll also accompany you,” Linghu An’an echoed.

“You may not.”

“The two of you are still very young. You still have great prospects ahead of you. How could you waste your lives following me?” said the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster.

“Lady Headmaster, after I was harmed by my closest kin, I no longer have any hope for this world,” Linghu Yueyue said with a forced smile.

Hearing those words, the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster was unable to contain her pain for her. She didn’t know how to advise Linghu Yueyue to not follow her.

She still remembered her absent-minded look when she had first saved her and Linghu An’an.

She knew very well what sort of injury she had received.

At that moment, Chu Feng was the one who suddenly spoke, “There are all sorts of people in this world. You couldn’t possibly be giving up on all the good people of this world because you’ve encountered extremely evil individuals, no?”

“Although you were harmed, didn’t An’an continue to stand by you? Although you were mere strangers, didn’t the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster save you? If you are to give up hope for this world like that, you would’ve truly let down those people that love you.”

Chu Feng continued, “Everyone’s paths are chosen by themselves. Linghu Yueyue, think carefully. Are you planning to escape like this, or do you plan to continue to be brave for the people that love you?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng clasped his fist at them and then turned to leave.

However, even after Chu Feng disappeared from their sight, Linghu Yueyue was still standing there. She continued to stare at the location where he had left, unwilling to leave.

“Young miss, Lord Asura has already left,” said Linghu An’an.

“An’an, do you not feel that Lord Asura resembles someone?” asked Linghu Yueyue.

“Resembles someone? Who? I’ve never felt that way.”

Linghu An’an thought carefully about the people that resembled Asura, but was ultimately unable to think of anyone.

“That guy from the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng,” said Linghu Yueyue.

“Him? How could he possibly be able to compare to Lord Asura? Ignoring the fact that Lord Asura’s talent far surpasses his, their moral character is also millions of miles apart.”

“Lord Asura not only has exceptional talent, but he also cares for the people of the world. How could a vile individual like that Chu Feng possibly be able to compare to Lord Asura?” Linghu An’an praised Asura nonstop, but was also belittling Chu Feng thoroughly.

“An’an, don’t say it like that. We cannot belittle him like that just because he was our enemy. Although I’ve not interacted with him much, I’ve never heard of him doing anything befitting of a vile character. Instead, all the rumors about him were that he is righteous and loyal,” said Linghu Yueyue.

“But, young miss, if it wasn’t for that Chu Feng, our Linghu Heavenly Clan would not have fallen apart. We would not have been reduced to our current state,” said Linghu An’an.

“Those were all the decisions made by my father. It was his ambition that led to the downfall of our Linghu Heavenly Clan. An’an, you cannot blame this matter on others. After all, the Chu Heavenly Clan never provoked us. It was us who forced them into desperate straits.”

“Otherwise, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master Long Daozhi would not have appeared either,” said Linghu Yueyue.

“Young miss, I actually understand everything you say. But...”

Linghu An’an didn’t know what to say. When she recalled what the Linghu Heavenly Clan had been reduced to, grief appeared on her face.

“Lady headmaster, where do you plan to go?” Linghu Yueyue looked to the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster.

“I’m still undecided. I might wander and see.”

“Yueyue, what that Lord Asura said earlier is very true. You should pull yourself together. You should not be escaping,” the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster urged Linghu Yueyue.

“Thank you for looking after me, Lady Headmaster. Please rest assured, I will not continue to sink into depression.”

Then, Linghu Yueyue took out the bottle gourd and intended to return it to the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster.

However, upon doing so, she discovered that the bottle gourd had actually shattered.

“Lady Headmaster, I... my fault deserves ten thousand deaths. I’ve actually destroyed such a precious treasure.”

Seeing the shattered bottle gourd, Linghu Yueyue started to panic and blame herself incessantly.

However, the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster merely chuckled. “When that mysterious expert gave me the bottle gourd, he told me that it isn’t something that can be used repeatedly. Its usage was limited. That was the reason why he told me that I must not use it unless it’s during a time of crisis.”

“Otherwise, why would I not have used the bottle gourd even though I’ve had it for so long?”

“Thus, Lady Headmaster, this bottle gourd is useless now?” asked Linghu An’an.

“Whether or not it can still be used can be determined by the imprint. If the imprint has disappeared, the bottle gourd will be completely useless,” said the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster.

Hearing those words, Linghu Yueyue immediately looked to the imprint on her body. It was then that she discovered that the imprint had really disappeared.

“Yueyue, you and An’an keep this.”

“To me, it is already useless. However, it is still of use for the two of you.”

As the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster spoke, she took out the green porcelain bowl.

Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an tried their hardest to refuse.

After all, they knew that the green porcelain bowl was even more precious than the bottle gourd, as it was a treasure that could be used to train.

However, in the end, their stubbornness lost to that of the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster, and they ended up accepting the green porcelain bowl.

Then, the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster left.

Seeing her back view, Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an felt extremely emotional.

With how vast the world was, it was very possible that this would be the final meeting between them and the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster.

“Young miss, where should we go?” asked Linghu An’an.

Hearing that question, Linghu Yueyue began to ponder. She also didn’t know where she should go.

“There’s someone!”

Suddenly, Linghu Yueyue’s expression changed. She immediately pulled Linghu An’an and hid.

Soon, several figures appeared in the distant sky.

They were people from the All-heaven Sect.

Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an were unable to determine the cultivation of those people.

Those people from the All-heaven Sect were walking in midair, and traveling at a rather slow pace. They also did not have any guards.

Because of that, the contents of their conversation were heard by both Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an.

As those people from the All-heaven Sect were merely passing by and did not discover Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an, they soon left the vicinity.

However, after they left, Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an were violently trembling. The two of them stood there stunned for a very long time.

The reason for that was because what those people from the All-heaven Sect had spoken about was the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

The news of the deaths of all the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen had reached Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an’s ears.

Even though Linghu Yueyue had already anticipated that the Linghu Heavenly Clan would have such a day under the leadership of her brutal and heartless father, she still teared up emotionally when the day had truly arrived. She was crying so hard that her body was twitching.

She was only able to regain her composure after crying for a very long time.

“Young miss, we must avenge Lord Clan Chief and others,” said Linghu An’an.

“Avenge? Don’t tell me that you want to follow in my father’s footsteps.”

“The Red-dress Holy Land, the Chu Heavenly Clan and even the Wuming Clan, what sort of hatred or grievance did they have with our Linghu Heavenly Clan? There’s simply none to speak of. It has always been us who provoked them.”

“And now, being inferior to others, we ended up being wiped out. How could we possibly have the shame to speak of revenge?” asked Linghu Yueyue.

“In that case, young miss, what sort of path should we take?” asked Linghu An’an while crying.

She actually didn’t really want to seek revenge. Merely, as she was still a member of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, she was truly lost as to what to do after learning that many of her clansmen had been killed.

“Let’s return home. The Linghu Heavenly Clan needs us,” said Linghu Yueyue.

“Okay! We’ll return home. Young miss, I’ve long wanted to return home.”

Linghu An’an cried even louder after hearing the words ‘return home.’

After making their decision, the two of them left.

What the two of them didn’t know was that there was actually a pair of eyes hidden in the void watching the two of them attentively.

That person was Chu Feng.

Actually, the people from the All-heaven Sect that had passed by in midair earlier were not real people at all.

They had been created by Chu Feng using his world spirit techniques.

Chu Feng wanted to let Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An’an learn of their clansmen’s death.

The reason why he did that was because he wanted Linghu Yueyue to return to the Linghu Heavenly Clan. He didn’t want the two of them to continue to wander the world.

Of course, there were two possible outcomes of letting Linghu Yueyue learn of her clansmen’s death.

One, Linghu Yueyue would try her hardest to get revenge.

As for the other, it was what had just happened.

It wasn’t that Chu Feng did not have any apprehensions that the first outcome would occur. The reason why he ultimately decided to do this was because he knew that it was impossible to keep the matter of the Linghu Heavenly clansmen’s deaths from Linghu Yueyue.

That said, Chu Feng was glad that Linghu Yueyue did not choose revenge. Instead, she was someone who knew how to look at things from a wider view, know what was right and what was wrong.

Seeing Linghu Yueyue like that, Chu Feng was very happy. After all, she had actually been going to die. It was him who had saved her.

If Linghu Yueyue were to become an avenger and decide to go harm those Chu Feng cared about, he would also feel burdened by his actions of saving her.

Fortunately, Linghu Yueyue had chosen the correct path.
