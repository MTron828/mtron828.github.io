Chapter 4885: Invasion of a Powerful Enemy

Shortly after the juniors entered, the Saint Lotus Tree began glowing brightly. This delighted Shengguang Baimei and the other elders of the Holy Valley.

Such a phenomenon had never occurred before.

It was such a warm glow that they felt that young miss Menglai and the others’ cultivation must have been smooth-sailing.

“It really is at full bloom. Young miss Menglai is truly extraordinary.”

A peal of hearty laughter suddenly sounded from the distance.

The crowd turned over to take a look and saw two men, one old and one young, heading in their direction. Their faces immediately lit up, and everyone except for Shengguang Baimei rushed over.

The young man had a thin but suave appearance, just that his complexion looked a little too pale. It was not that he wasn’t good-looking, but it felt a little eerie, as if he wasn’t a living human.

The old man had luxuriant white hair that was puffed up like a lion’s fur. He had sharp eyebrows that made his eyes look imposing. If one didn’t know better, one would have thought that he was a Lion Demon who had successfully cultivated into its human form.

The young man was around two meters in height, making him taller than an average human. However, the old man was over nine meters in height, causing him to tower over anyone in his presence. Coupled with his brawny figure, he did look quite frightening.

“Lord Shishen, young master Qianyu, you’re finally back!”

The crowd was overjoyed to see the two of them.

Lord Shishen was the other person who was of equal standing to Shengguang Baimei, second to only the Holy Monarch himself. As for the young man, Shengguang Qianyu, he was Shengguang Shishen’s disciple, and he was of distinguished background too.

Shengguang Shishen had brought Shengguang Qianyu out to train, and they ought to have been back a long time ago. Yet, there were no signs of them around. As a result, there were many in the Holy Valley who worried about their plight.

As such, it was a huge relief to see them returning safe and sound.

“Lord Shishen, why were you gone for so long?” Shengguang Buyu asked worriedly.

“Haa, let’s not talk about that. I could have returned earlier, but I stumbled onto some trouble along the way. It’s only fortunate that it was just a scare. Quick, tell me about the full bloom. How did it happen? Speaking of which, can my disciple enter the Saint Lotus Tree too?” Shengguang Shishen asked.

“Lord Shishen, I’m afraid that young master Qianyu won’t be able to enter the Saint Lotus Tree anymore. The spirit formation gate has already closed up,” Shengguang Buyu replied.

“Closed up? We should be able to open it up once more, right? Our Qianyu should be qualified to receive such a privilege!” Shengguang Shishen argued indignantly.

“Actually, this full bloom wasn’t triggered by our own people. It was the doing of an outsider,” Shengguang Buyu replied.

“An outsider?”

Shengguang Shishen and Shengguang Qianyu looked at one another in astonishment.

“Elder Buyu, fill me in on the details,” Shengguang Shishen said out of curiosity.

Shengguang Buyu quickly told everything that had transpired to Shengguang Shishen.

“There’s actually such a formidable prodigy in our Holy Light Clan? Are the juniors out there that formidable nowadays?”

Shengguang Shishen was astounded.

“Teacher, I might just be thinking too much into it, but the person whom Elder Buyu spoke of seems to resemble the person whom we met back then,” Shengguang Qianyu remarked contemplatively.

“You’re referring to the one we met at the Whitesky Star River?” Shengguang Shishen asked.

“Yes, that’s what I’m thinking,” Shengguang Qianyu replied.

“Elder Buyu, I need you to draw that junior out for me. I want to see his appearance,” Shengguang Shishen urged.

Shengguang Buyu quickly drew out Chu Feng’s appearance using his spirit power.

“Ssss! It really is him!”

The looks on Shengguang Shishen and Shengguang Qianyu’s faces turned complicated.

“Lord Shishen, do you recognize Chu Feng?” Shengguang Buyu asked.

Shengguang Baimei looked at the teacher and disciple duo with a contemplative frown.

“We do. Of course we do. Elder Buyu, you said that we were the ones who captured Chu Feng into the Holy Valley?” Shengguang Shishen asked.

“Yes, it was Lord Baimei who captured him,” Shengguang Buyu replied.

“Aiya! Baimei, you have really gotten yourself into trouble this time around!”

Shengguang Shishen walked up to Shengguang Baimei and slapped his arm.

“What are you getting so agitated for? He’s a mere junior of the Holy Light Clan. Someone like that actually dares to undermine the honor of our Holy Valley. Isn’t it only normal for me to capture and deal with him?” Shengguang Baimei spoke with a displeased tone.

“A mere junior? You must be kidding me! That fellow has formidable experts backing him!”

Shengguang Shishen quickly told Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, and the others about their encounter with Chu Feng.

Upon hearing the recount, Shengguang Buyu fell into deep thought. He had guessed that Chu Feng was no ordinary junior, but he didn’t think that his backing would be this formidable.

To think that even someone of Shengguang Shishen’s caliber would be helpless before Chu Feng’s backing!

The other elders also looked uneasy too. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Only Shengguang Baimei looked more composed in comparison. He shot doubtful looked at Shengguang Shishen and Shengguang Buyu.

“Shengguang Buyu, it looks like I’ve underestimated your influence. I didn’t expect you to be abel to convince Shengguang Shishen to help you in protecting Chu Feng. If you wish to save him, you can just say it outright. There’s no need for you to spout such lies.”

Shengguang Baimei didn’t believe what Shengguang Shishen had said. Instead, he thought that Shengguang Shishen had colluded with Shengguang Buyu and was spouting lies so as to convince him to spare Chu Feng.

“Shengguang Baimei, did you get hit on the head? You really think that I’m uttering lies here? Let me tell you, I’m saying all of this with the welfare of the Holy Valley at heart, not you! If you intend to continue messing with Chu Feng, you should leave the Holy Valley right now. Don’t implicate the rest of us with the trouble you’ve caused!” Shengguang Shishen snapped.

The others might be afraid of Shengguang Baimei, but not him.

“So what if what you’ve said is real? We have the Holy Monarch to hold the fort. Why would we need to fear a mere outsider? I never thought that you, Shengguang Shishen, would be so cowardly. It looks like I’ve overestimated you!”

Shengguang Baimei thought little of Shengguang Shishen’s warning.

“You don’t know anything at all!” Shengguang Shishen bellowed furiously.

However, Shengguang Baimei simply directed a disdainful smile toward Shengguang Shishen.

“Lord Baimei, bad news!”

Several elders dressed in world spiritist cloaks and a veiled bamboo hat suddenly rushed over.

Shengguang Baimei couldn’t help but nervously frown upon seeing them.

These elders held considerable positions in the Holy Valley. If someone of their standing were declaring that there was bad news, something big must have happened.

“What happened?” Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Shishen asked.

The elders landed in front of the two of them and kneeled on the ground. The crowd could see the horror and unease on their faces. Their hands wouldn’t stop trembling even while they were bowing to Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Shishen.

“Lord Baimei, Lord Shishen, bad news! A powerful enemy has infiltrated our Holy Valley. We need to inform Lord Holy Monarch right away!” the elders said.

“What?”

The crowd was appalled to hear those words.
