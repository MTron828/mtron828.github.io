Chapter 4034 - Awakened Bloodline

“Asura, you really shouldn’t have come here,” Tuoba Chengan said to Chu Feng.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, Tuoba Chengan attacked.

With a wave of his sleeve, boundless oppressive might was released from within him, and surged forth to suppress Chu Feng.

His oppressive might was different from normal oppressive mights; it was visible to the naked eye.

His oppressive might turned into countless giant sickles. He intended to dismember Chu Feng into ten thousand pieces.

However, facing the incoming oppressive might, Chu Feng showed no signs of avoidance. Instead, the corners of his lips rose into a faint smile.

It was such a relaxed and confident smile.

Tuoba Chengan did not notice the smile on Chu Feng’s face at all. He believed that he would be able to easily kill him, and that Chu Feng was not dodging his oppressive might because he was powerless to do so, not because he didn’t attempt to do so.

It was only when the sickles arrived before Chu Feng and passed through his body that Tuoba Chengan discovered that things were not so simple.

Even though the power of the sickles did not decrease at all, even though they had sliced through even space itself. Even though sparks flew all around Chu Feng as they arrived before him. They were, no matter how mighty they appeared to be, unable to affect him in the slightest.

After all those sickles had swept past Chu Feng’s body, not a single strand of Chu Feng’s hair was cut by them.

“You... managed to block my oppressive might?”

Tuoba Chengan frowned. He began to examine his surroundings in panic.

He didn’t believe that it was Chu Feng who had blocked his oppressive might.

He felt that it was very possible that there was an expert protecting him. He also felt that that expert was very likely Zhao Hong.

“What’s inappropriate about me blocking your oppressive might?”

“Since I dared to show myself, it means that I am confident in my ability to handle you.”

“How could I possibly fear you when I did not even place the leaders of the five great powers in my eyes?”

As Chu Feng spoke, he began walking slowly towards Tuoba Chengan.

“Could it be that you have more treasures on you?”

“Exactly how many treasures do you have?”

Tuoba Chengan started to panic. As he spoke, he began to move backwards.

At the same time, an Incomplete Exalted Armament appeared in his hand.

“There is no need for me to use treasures to take care of you,” said Chu Feng.

“Arrogance.”

“Clank~~~”

Suddenly, Tuoba Chengan’s arm swept upwards. His Incomplete Exalted Armament had turned into a ray of light that shot straight towards Chu Feng.

It was a sword, a completely silver sword. Purple flames could be seen rising from that silver sword.

That was an Immortal Technique. It was an Immortal Technique that was perfectly matched with the Incomplete Exalted Armament.

Once the sword appeared, violent trembling immediately filled the surrounding space. Many of the monstrous beasts present started bleeding from all seven of their facial orifices due to the intense pressure emitted by the sword.

However, even though that sword was so very powerful, Chu Feng merely shifted his body and easily dodged it.

Then, he extended his hand and made a grabbing motion.

“Clank,” Chu Feng actually grabbed the sword with his hand.

“You... you actually possess battle power that surpasses my own?”

“Exactly how did you achieve that?”

“Were you concealing your strength?”

“No, that’s impossible. You couldn’t possibly have concealed your strength.”

“If you had, you wouldn’t have used that treasure to increase your battle power with great difficulty all so that you could take on our All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.”

“Treasure! That’s it! You must be using a treasure!”

Tuoba Chengan completely panicked at that moment.

He had originally thought that someone might be secretly protecting Chu Feng.

It was only at that moment that he discovered that Chu Feng was relying on his own strength.

Yet, even at that moment, he was unable to sense Chu Feng’s cultivation.

“Treasure?”

Chu Feng chuckled with contempt. Then, he said, “Since you’re going to die, I might as well let you die knowing.”

“Buzz~~~”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, his body began to change.

It turned out that there was armor covering him. It was that armor that had protected him and made it so that Tuoba Chengan’s attacks were unable to injure him.

As for that armor, it was a spirit formation.

“Spirit power. You actually blocked my attacks with your spirit power?”

“No, that’s impossible! That is definitely impossible! This old man is no ignorant fool, I’ve heard of the battle power of world spiritists.”

“Even if your battle power has greatly increased because you’re a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, you’ll only be comparable to a rank one Utmost Exalted.”

“This old man is a rank three Utmost Exalted. How could you possibly suppress this old man using world spirit techniques?”

“To use a treasure, Asura, even if you are able to win, you’re enjoying an unfair advantage.”

Tuoba Chengan was convinced that Chu Feng was using the power of a treasure to suppress him.

Chu Feng let out a faint chuckle. He had no desire to bother explaining things.

He felt that there was no reason for him to explain things, and that it would do as long as Tuoba Chengan knew what was happening.

What Tuoba Chengan had said was actually correct. Ordinary Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists indeed only possessed battle power capable of contending against rank one Utmost Exalteds.

Chu Feng was only able to gain a battle power capable of contending against rank two Utmost Exalteds by using the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

As for being able to contend against rank three Utmost Exalteds, it had to do with Grandmaster Tang Chen’s spirit formation.

Although Chu Feng had ultimately failed at breaching the spirit formation, during the process of attempting to breach the spirit formation, during the time he’d been suppressed by the spirit formation, his bloodline power had undergone a transformation.

Perhaps it was his concealed power that had awakened. Or perhaps his bloodline had evolved.

However, one thing was certain -- his bloodline power had risen to a higher level.

Because of that, Chu Feng had gained strength far superior to other world spiritists.

Ordinary Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists only possessed battle power comparable to rank one Utmost Exalteds.

In the past, that was also the case for Chu Feng.

However, ever since his bloodline power had grown to a higher level, Chu Feng had gained power comparable to rank two Utmost Exalted.

Adding on the power of his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, Chu Feng now possessed the battle power of a rank three Utmost Exalted.

Furthermore, both the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and Chu Feng’s bloodline power were very strong. As such, Chu Feng’s battle power was far superior to ordinary rank three Utmost Exalted.

That was the reason why he had dared to show himself even after finding out Tuoba Chengan was there.

It was also the reason why he was able to so easily block Tuoba Chengan’s attacks.

Lastly, it was the reason why Chu Feng had wanted to thank Grandmaster Tang Chen even though he had failed at breaching the spirit formation.

“Tuoba Chengan, you are a vicious and merciless evildoer.”

“The way I see it, the amount of evil you’ve committed might not necessarily be less than that of Liu Shuo.”

“Someone like you should not continue to exist in this world.”

“Today, I shall end you.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he grabbed Tuoba Chengan’s Incomplete Exalted Armament and began walking slowly towards him.

Tuoba Chengan turned pale with fear.

He began stepping backwards repeatedly. With every step Chu Feng took, he felt death coming a step closer to him.

The slowly approaching fear nearly drove him insane.

Finally, he was unable to contain himself, and began to cry bitterly.

That Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect, someone who stood below a single person and above tens of thousands, was actually weeping bitter tears before Chu Feng.

“Asura, I won’t lie. I have indeed committed many wrongs. However, I was forced to commit them. It has always been Liu Shuo who forced me to do those things.”

“There is no reason for you to go this far for the conflict between us.”

“As for the grudges between Liu Shuo and Zhao Hong, it also has nothing to do with me.”

“Asura, give me another chance. Please give me another chance to turn over a new leaf.”

“I’m willing to give you all the treasures I have on me. I, Tuoba Chengan, am willing to become your servant, your slave.”

“Asura, I beg of you, please give me another chance.”

“I guarantee that I, Tuoba Chengan, will start fresh, and no longer commit anymore atrocities.”

Desperate, Tuoba Chengan began to beg for forgiveness.

“Wuahh~~~”

However, before he could even finish his words, a scream was heard.

Chu Feng had arrived before Tuoba Chengan. The sword he held in his hand had pierced into Tuoba Chengan’s dantian.

“Woosh~~~”

Blood splattered everywhere as Chu Feng pulled out the sword.

Tuoba Chengan immediately fell to his knees. Even though he had a look of pain, he still held his dantian with his hands.

Chu Feng was able to tell that there was a special sort of medicinal pellet in his hands. That pellet turned into power that was entering his dantian nonstop.

Tuoba Chengan was attempting to restore his pierced dantian and keep his cultivation from seeping out.

Even though he was faced with a calamity, he was still trying his hardest to keep his cultivation.

Seeing Tuoba Chengan like that, Chu Feng let out a sneer. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Don’t be afraid. I, Asura, am always one to know how severe I want my attacks to be.”

“This time around, you will most definitely not be able to keep your cultivation.”
