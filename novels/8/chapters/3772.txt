Chapter 3772 - Havoc

“I’ve decided,” Chu Lingxi had a look of determination as she answered Gu Mingyuan.

“Great. This is truly great. My dear daughter, you should’ve made this decision long ago.”

After hearing Chu Lingxi’s answer, Gu Mingyuan became even more joyous. She was smiling like a blooming flower. She was so excited that she actually hugged Chu Lingxi, picked her up and spun her around.

One must know that Gu Mingyuan was a very composed and even cold individual.

From this, one could imagine how astonishing of a thing it was for Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others to see how excited she currently was.

“Lingxi, exactly what did you agree to with your mother?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked curiously.

“Mother, put me down,” Chu Lingxi said to Gu Mingyuan.

Gu Mingyuan actually did as Chu Lingxi said and put her down.

After being put down, Chu Lingxi walked over to Chu Xuanzhengfa. She actually had a difficult look on her face.

“Putt~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Lingxi kneeled on the ground. She then kowtowed to Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Lingxi, what are you doing?”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief hurriedly stepped forward and helped Chu Lingxi back up.

“Lord Clan Chief, I have let down the Chu Heavenly Clan. I am unqualified to be a member of the clan.”

After being helped up, Chu Lingxi started to tremble. She was weeping so much that her face was completely covered in tears.

“Lingxi, exactly what is going on?”

Seeing Chu Lingxi like that, Chu Xuanzhengfa became very worried.

In a panic, Chu Xuanzhengfa turned his gaze to Gu Mingyuan. He was seeking an answer from her.

Compared to the nervous Chu Xuanzhengfa, Gu Mingyuan was extremely calm.

“Lingxi, just tell it as it is. I believe the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others will be able to understand too," Gu Mingyuan said to Chu Lingxi.

Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi began to wipe away her tears and adjust her state of mind.

Then, she began to explain things to Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Chu Lingxi had two different bloodline powers -- the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Heavenly Bloodline and the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan’s inherited bloodline.

For the sake of allowing Chu Lingxi to surpass her in the future, Gu Mingyuan had used a secret technique to seal away her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan’s bloodline power when she was born.

In fact, rather than saying sealed, it would be more accurate to say that her bloodline power was being reforged; being refined.

The reason why Chu Lingxi was able to grasp two different bloodline powers with great proficiency was due to what Gu Mingyuan had done back then.

And now, the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan’s bloodline power within Chu Lingxi’s body was even stronger than that of Gu Mingyuan’s.

However, Chu Lingxi was unable to control that bloodline power. She was only able to unleash a very limited portion of its power.

In fact, she needed to utilize the power of a treasure in order to increase her cultivation by a level.

This was simply an enormous waste of the powerful bloodline power within her.

The reason why this was happening was due to the existence of the Heavenly Bloodline.

Due to the fact that she was controlling two different sorts of bloodline powers and putting a greater focus on her Heavenly Bloodline, it led to Chu Lingxi being unable to fully unleash the power of her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan’s bloodline, even though it was stronger.

Because of that, Gu Mingyuan had proposed to have Chu Lingxi renounce her Heavenly Bloodline.

She wanted Chu Lingxi to suppress her Heavenly Bloodline and put all her focus into the cultivation of her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan’s bloodline.

With that, Chu Lingxi’s cultivation speed would accelerate.

However, at the time the proposal was raised, Chu Lingxi refused it.

She would rather her cultivation speed be slower than to suppress her Heavenly Bloodline. To Chu Lingxi, she felt that her Heavenly Bloodline was her true bloodline, her roots.

However, for the sake of catching up to Chu Feng, Chu Lingxi decided to suppress her Heavenly Bloodline and focus wholly on cultivating her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan’s bloodline.

That was why she’d knelt, kowtowed and had cried so hard earlier.

“Foolish girl, you are only suppressing it temporarily, not sealing it forever. There is no need to react like this.”

“Besides, even if you decided to permanently seal away your Heavenly Bloodline, if you are able to increase your cultivation by doing that, your father will also support you.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“As long as you’re surnamed Chu, you will forever be my daughter, forever be a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan.” Chu Xuanzhengfa heaved a sigh of relief upon learning what was going on.

To him, this was a trifling matter.

“Lingxi, what your father said is correct. Go ahead and focus on training.”

“Although familial love and friendships are important in this world, you’ve also witnessed how dangerous the martial cultivation world is. If you want to be able to live your life peacefully in this world, you must have a strong cultivation.”

“Thus, increasing your cultivation quickly is more important than anything else.”

“As for bloodline powers, they are trivial matters,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled and comforted Chu Lingxi as well.

Hearing those words from her father and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the burden was lifted from Chu Lingxi’s heart.

“Mother, in that case, when shall we set off?” Chu Lingxi looked to Gu Mingyuan.

“When do you want to set off?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

“Right away,” said Chu Lingxi.

......

Even if two starfields were adjacent to one another, there was still a considerable amount of distance between them.

Traveling from the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm to the All-heaven Starfield’s Reincarnation Upper Realm was destined to be a long journey.

Even though Chu Feng had Grandmaster Liangqiu’s treasure, it still took him over a dozen days to arrive at the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

At the moment Chu Feng stepped out of the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation, what appeared before him was a world in another starfield.

That place was the All-heaven Starfield’s Reincarnation Upper Realm.

“This feeling, it’s truly been a long time.”

Chu Feng had a look of excitement on his face. It was an excitement that he had not had for a long time.

Everything there was new to him. The flowers, plants, trees and even the air felt fresh and unfamiliar.

Arriving in an unfamiliar land would always be a journey filled with unknowns.

Everything was so very unfamiliar, and waiting for Chu Feng to explore.

Chu Feng was actually very fond of this sort of feeling.

After all, he was destined to be someone that disliked comfort.

Besides, the All-heaven Starfield was also the territory of the All-heaven Sect.

The All-heaven Sect had attempted to subjugate the Ancestral Martial Starfield to be under their rule, and had nearly succeeded.

As someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Chu Feng felt very displeased by that.

Because of that, Chu Feng had never thought about simply returning to the Ancestral Martial Starfield after arriving there.

Chu Feng had decided to cause havoc in the All-heaven Starfield.

Otherwise, he would not be able to appease his resentment.
