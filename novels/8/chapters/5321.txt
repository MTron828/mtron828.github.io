Chapter 5321: Danger

“Enough. You’re still suffering from the backlash. You ought to rest a little. Leave the rest to me,” Chu Feng said before heading deeper into the cavern by himself.

The test was still ongoing, and they had wasted quite a bit of time at the start. They had to make haste now if they wanted to clear the test on time. 

“Chu Feng, there’s a different look in Bai Yunqing’s eyes when he looks at you now. You have tamed him,” Eggy said.

“Saying that I tamed him is an exaggeration. He might be a little arrogant, but he’s not a bad person at heart,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s hard to say. I’ll put it out here now. It’s one thing if he earnestly hopes to get along with you, but if he dares pull any tricks, you can be certain that I won’t go easy on him,” Eggy said.

“Of course. Milady Queen is always right. You can deal with him however you please,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Tsk. Don’t try to bootlick me.” Eggy clicked her tongue. 

She was always worried about Chu Feng whenever he made new friends. As much as he was merciless toward his enemies, he was also willing to go all out for his friends. In her view, it was Chu Feng’s friends, rather than his enemies, who were more likely to put him in danger.

Chu Feng continued venturing deeper into the cavern. Soon, he reached a dead end. The wall blocking his path was covered in complicated runes, and a message was hidden in them. 

The message contained two formation deciphering methods. 

One of them was much simpler than the other. If he could employ this formation deciphering method, he would be able to regenerate the spirit formation gate and leave the area. 

The second one was much harder, but if he successfully pulled it off, not only would they escape from this cavern, but the Ancient Realm’s juniors who entered this place together with them would receive great benefits too. On top of that, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing would also receive world spiritist techniques that could enlighten them.  

However, Chu Feng uncovered an even more obscurely hidden message on top of that.

Unlike the two formation deciphering methods, which he had uncovered using his spirit power, this obscurely hidden message was discovered through his own intelligence. It was so obscure that Chu Feng couldn’t fully comprehend it, but he did feel a dangerous vibe from it. 

Danger? Where could the danger be from? Is it referring to the cavern or the Ancient Realm as a whole?

This message felt like a warning. Chu Feng wondered if this was related to why his father had left the Ancient Realm back then. Did his father give up on the subsequent tests because he sensed the dangerous vibe too?

Chu Feng told Eggy about the matter before asking, “What do you think about it?”

“You’re saying that your father might have left because he sensed the dangerous vibe from the message?” Eggy asked.

“That’s what I’m thinking,” Chu Feng replied.

“Are you intending to back out?” Eggy asked.

“I believe that my father has his own reasons for backing out, but I don’t want to miss the opportunity to obtain the two Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads. Eggy, what do you think I should do?” Chu Feng was in a dilemma. 

“Everyone has their own path to walk on. You shouldn’t feel compelled to walk in your father’s footsteps. You should ignore your father’s past decision and make your own choice based on the current circumstances laid out before you,” Eggy said.

“If I have to choose, I’d want to continue challenging the tests,” Chu Feng replied.

“There is your answer. What are you afraid of? You have the Totem Dragon Clan’s token protecting you. Worse comes to worst, you have your father’s protection formation inside of you! There’s nothing for you to worry about! Besides, I’m here too,” Eggy confidently said.

“All right, let’s go through with this then!” Having made up his mind, Chu Feng began employing the formation deciphering method he had just learned.

Not too long later, he successfully constructed his formation and infused it into the underground cavern. The underground cavern started to tremble right away.

Teleportation energy shrouded Chu Feng and transported him to where the Ancient Realm’s juniors were. Shortly after, Bai Yunqing was also teleported to the same location. 

“What happened, big brother?” 

Bai Yunqing was in a much better state than before, but he looked baffled. He didn’t understand why he was suddenly transported here when he was still recuperating a moment ago. 

The Ancient Realm’s juniors also looked confused too.

Boom!

The walls suddenly shook intensely. A peculiar surge of energy flowed out. 

Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing weren’t too affected by the energy, but the Ancient Realm’s juniors paled in horror.

“Young hero Chu Feng, save us!”

The Ancient Realm’s juniors rushed over to Chu Feng’s side to seek his protection. Inside the surge of energy, they sensed a frightening power that would devastate their bloodline. 

“Don’t be afraid. This energy is beneficial to your bloodline,” Chu Feng said.

“You can’t really mean that, young hero Chu Feng. How could this energy be beneficial to us?”

The Ancient Realm’s juniors found Chu Feng’s words hard to believe, especially when they felt a grievous threat from the energy. 

“Trust me. Sit down and cultivate using that surge of energy,” Chu Feng instructed.

Despite their skepticism, there was still one person who did as she was told—Lai Tiantian. A beaming smile soon emerged on her face.

“Young hero Chu Feng is right! We can cultivate with that energy. Quick, you should do it too!” Lai Tiantian urged the crowd.

The others might have still hesitated if Lai Tiantian’s words had only been empty talk, but she had started emanating a golden aura that clearly originated from her bloodline. This prompted the other juniors to follow suit, and bright smiles quickly appeared on their faces too.

Chu Feng really hadn’t lied to them. 

“What are you standing in a daze for? Use your heart to feel the world spiritist technique hidden inside the energy. It’ll be beneficial to your development as a world spiritist,” Chu Feng told Bai Yunqing. 

Bai Yunqing quickly did as he was told.

When the energy finally dissipated, everyone opened their eyes at the same time.

“My gosh! Big brother, were you the one who did that? You must have deciphered the test and brought such a huge benefit to us!” Bai Yunqing looked at Chu Feng with ravenous joy.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He had just received some invaluable insights into world spiritist techniques. Admittedly, it wasn't much at all, but it was always delightful to receive a freebie.

Chu Feng turned to the Ancient Realm’s juniors and saw that their bodies were glowing golden.

“Looks like you have benefited quite a bit out of this,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“It’s all thanks to young hero Chu Feng!” The Ancient Realm’s juniors bowed to Chu Feng out of gratitude. 

“I won’t let you regret your decision to go with me. You can be assured that I’ll try my best to acquire anything that’s beneficial to you. Now that you have gotten your fair share of the benefit, it’s about time for us to return. Otherwise, Bai Yunqing and I will really be disqualified from the test,” Chu Feng said before heading back in the same direction where they had come from. 

The Ancient Realm’s juniors obediently followed him without asking any questions. It was the same for Bai Yunqing too. After witnessing everything Chu Feng had accomplished, they had absolute confidence in him.

Chu Feng was heading back because he knew that the spirit formation gate they had entered this underground cavern through had reappeared at the same location. 

… 

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Zhou Dong and the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Qin Shu, and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s Jia Chengying had already returned to the square. 

It was worth mentioning that the juniors following Zhou Dong and Jia Chengying were emanating white light. This was a sign that they had received benefits from the test.

In comparison, Qin Shu’s complexion looked awful. 

The juniors who had entered the underground cavern with him hadn’t received any benefits at all. It couldn’t be helped since he was disadvantaged in this test due to his lack of proficiency as a world spiritist. Clearing the test already posed a huge challenge to him. 

It was just that the contrast with the other challengers made him appear weak, which left him feeling embarrassed.

“Young hero Chu Feng isn’t out yet? I’m curious to know what benefits those who went with young hero Chu Feng received,” a junior asked.

“Benefits? What a joke. Look at the time! Your young hero Chu Feng might not even be able to clear the test, let alone secure any benefits for the juniors!” Jia Chengying scorned.

It was only then that the crowd realized that the test would be coming to an end within fifteen minutes’ time. Chu Feng would be eliminated if he didn’t come out soon.

Weng!

The spirit formation gate that Chu Feng’s team had entered at the very start of the test shimmered, and Chu Feng’s team walked out. 

Jia Chengying’s face darkened. Just another fifteen minutes and Chu Feng would have been eliminated, but he managed to make it right before the clock ticked down. What happened next caused his complexion to turn even worse.

All of the Ancient Realm’s juniors following Chu Feng were emanating a golden glow. Despite being an outsider, Jia Chengying could feel the pulsating bloodline power coming from them. 

The Ancient Realm’s chief and elders widened their eyes in astonishment. The eyes of the other juniors reddened in envy.

“Damn it! I could have been on a team with young hero Chu Feng if I just ran a tab bit faster! Why was I so slow?” a junior standing behind Jia Chengying sighed in lamentation.

This caused Jia Chengying’s gaze to turn cold. How can you say those words when I acquired this benefit for you? What an ingrate you are!

What Jia Chengying heard next nearly caused him to choke.

“Big brother Chu Feng, did we make it in time?” Bai Yunqing stepped out of the spirit formation gate and asked Chu Feng with a smile.

His amiable attitude toward Chu Feng surprised not just Jia Chengying but everyone else too. All this while, he had been treating Chu Feng with hostility, but all of a sudden, he had become so subservient as if he was Chu Feng’s lackey.

Bai Yunqing himself didn’t seem to care about how others viewed him. He kept following Chu Feng around although the test had come to an end, intimately addressing the latter ‘big brother’. Even the white-haired woman, who didn’t attend the test, was surprised by his attitude.

Did this fellow eat the wrong medicine or something?
