MGA: Chapter 1440 - One Word, Weak

“Rank three Half Martial Emperor. With his cultivation, even Lin Yezhou and Qin Lingyun would not be worthy of mention before him.”

“Likely, there are no disciple’s among all of the Nine Power’s disciples who could contend against him.”

“However, the Dongfang Imperial Clan was able to cultivate such a genius. From this, it could be seen that the Nine Powers are truly inferior to the Four Great Imperial Clans.”

Chu Feng sensed Dongfang Zexuan’s cultivation. Rank three Half Martial Emperor, this was the strongest person of his generation that Chu Feng had met so far. It could be said that this Dongfang Zexuan would truly reign superior among all of the members of the younger generation.

To be able to become a rank three Half Martial Emperor at such a young age, if he were to be given several more decades or centuries, what sort of level would his cultivation reach?

Perhaps in less than a hundred years he would be able to surpass all of the experts present right now, step into the realm that countless other people had failed to, and become a grand Martial Emperor.

Upon thinking about it like that, although this Dongfang Zexuan might be arrogant, he was qualified to be arrogant. This qualification that he possessed was something that neither Lin Yezhou nor Qin Lingyun possessed.

Other than the people from the Dongfang Imperial Clan, Chu Feng also noticed three other groups of people. Each group wasn’t very large, and only possessed a couple of people. However, each and every one of them were grand characters with very powerful strength.

These three groups of people were naturally the people from the Jadewater Temple, Firerain Hall and the Eight Desolate Mountain Ranges.

Even though they had come as visitors, everyone knew that they had only come to help the Dongfang Imperial Clan.

As for the assistance that they were providing, it was definitely not only an assistance of their martial power. No, they were helping to spread the news. Without doing anything, they had become a source of oppression for the World Spiritist Alliance.

In other words, if Dongfang Zexuan’s challenge were to end in failure, it would all be fine.

However, if Dongfang Zexuan were to achieve victory, they would not only become the witnesses to this competition, they would also become the people to spread the news of this competition to the outside world

They would use their grand statuses to spread this matter. They would let everyone know that Dongfang Zexuan had defeated the World Spiritist Alliance’s geniuses using only world spirit techniques.

At that time, Dongfang Zexuan would become famous. At the same time, the World Spiritist Alliance’s status would also receive a blow.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Dongfang Zexuan’s figure moved. He turned into a golden ray of light and soared into the sky like a golden dragon. Immediately afterward, he rapidly landed on the ground. He had left the spectator’s viewing platform and arrived at the fighting platform at the center of the plaza.

Even though Dongfang Zexuan’s movements were extremely simple, they were sufficient to display his absolute strength and make all of the other members of the younger generation present feel inferior and the older generation experts present praise him nonstop.

Even though this plaza was filled with talents, Dongfang Zexuan was still a dragon among all the people present, someone who no one could compare with.

“I’ll speak frankly. I, Dongfang Zexuan, do not enjoy wasting time. While you all can come at me one at a time, it would still be better for you to bring your strongest disciples out to fight against me right away. After all, the result will be the same, I will be the one who will win.” Dongfang Zexuan spoke with a calm voice. His tone was the same as his appearance -- filled with arrogance.

“Alliance Master, allow me to deal with that Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Third Prince,” Lin Yezhou, who was standing behind the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master, stepped forward.

In truth, the World Spiritist Alliance was unable to take out many disciples from the younger generation who were able to contend against Dongfang Zexuan. As for Lin Yezhou, he was their best choice. After all, he held the reputation as the number one genius of the World Spiritist Alliance.

“Go ahead. It’s merely a spar to swap pointers. It will suffice to stop when victory and defeat is determined.”

The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master had high hopes for Lin Yezhou. Even though Lin Yezhou was definitely unable to contend against Dongfang Zexuan in terms of cultivation, in fact, it could even be said that the gap between their cultivations was so far away that it was akin to the distance between heaven and earth, Lin Yezhou still held absolute superiority in terms of world spirit techniques.

After all, the Dongfang Imperial Clan were not experts with world spirit techniques. However, the World Spiritist Alliance was the publicly renowned top power in terms of world spirit techniques.

“As you wish,” After Lin Yezhou received permission, he soared onto the platform at the center of the plaza. He stood at a place less than a hundred meters away from Dongfang Zexuan.

“Third Prince, please,” After landing, Lin Yezhou clasped his fist respectfully toward Dongfang Zexuan. Even though this was only proper etiquette, he was neither servile nor overbearing. It could be said that he had properly displayed his status as the number one disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance.

“Heh...” Dongfang Zexuan took a glance to size up Lin Yezhou. He did not say anything. However, a smile of contempt emerged on his face.

He was looking down on Lin Yezhou. Absolutely looking down on him. Regardless of how much of a great existence Lin Yezhou might be in the World Spiritist Alliance, he was unable to even be placed in Dongfang Zexuans’ eyes.

“Dongfang Zexuan, I know that you’re very powerful, however, what you are going to compete with me in are world spirit techniques. In terms of world spirit techniques, you are not necessarily going to be my match.”

Being looked down on by his opponent in such a manner, Lin Yezhou displayed dissatisfaction. With a single thought from him, boundless Royal level spirit power surged forth from his body and lingered around him like golden flames.

“Royal-cloak world spiritist?!” When the experts of the Jadewater Temple, Firerain Hall and the Eight Desolate Mountain Ranges saw the spirit power emitted by Lin Yezhou, their eyes all started to shine with surprise. Clearly, none of them had expected such a genius to appear in the World Spiritist Alliance.

However, compared to them, the people from the Dongfang Imperial Clan were abnormally calm. They were not at all stunned by Lin Yezhou being a royal-cloak world spiritist.

“What use is there to speak all those superfluous words? Might as well start the match,” Dongfang Zexuan sneered.

“How do you wish to compete?” Lin Yezhou asked.

“As men, we should not bother with those useless things. I’ll defend and you’ll attack. After that, you’ll defend and I’ll attack. Let’s see who will be able to break apart the other person’s spirit formation. The victor will be the one who breaks the other’s spirit formation.”

As Dongfang Zexuan spoke, he gave a thought, and a boundless amount of spirit power surged forth from him. Then, it turned into a ten-meter-tall golden shield that flickered with radiance.

When they saw this shield, many people from the World Spiritist Alliance started to frown. Without mentioning how powerful the shield might be, merely the world spirit power that Dongfang Zexuan emitted was royal level.

It turned out that the Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Third Prince was also a royal-cloak world spiritist. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

While the World Spiritist Alliance cultivating a young royal-cloak world spiritist was only natural, the Dongfang Imperial Clan cultivating a young royal-cloak world spiritist was an unbelievable feat.

“Very well, in that case, I’ll be attacking.”

Although Lin Yezhou realized that his opponent was not simple, he was not at all discouraged. He who had always been confident in himself did not think much, and directly unleashed an attack.

“Boom~~~”

The boundless golden spirit power started to surge like a golden wave. It smashed directly into Dongfang Zexuans’ shield.

When the golden wave smashed into the shield, it turned into surging energy ripples and bombarded the shield. However, that shield did not move, and was not damaged in the slightest.

“One word, weak,” Dongfang Zexuans’ lips raised upwards and he then let out this sentence of ridicule.
