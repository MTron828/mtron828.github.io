Chapter 4986: Song Luoyi

Upon hearing the voice, Situ Zhonglan immediately gathered every last bit of strength she had to flee from the area. Yet, she discovered that she was unable to move at all.

An incredibly powerful oppressive might had sealed off her movements.

Knowing that it was impossible for her to escape, she turned around to face the person standing behind her. She wanted to know who in the Eastern Region was so audacious as to dare make a move against their Situ World Spiritist Clan.

It was an old grandmother floating in mid-air.

If Chu Feng was present, he would have been excited to see the old grandmother. It was the mysterious grandmother he had encountered when he headed to Reincarnation Upper Realm’s Mount Ivory Valley to gather a huge amount of Spirit Spring Water to enhance his spirit power.

The old grandmother was neatly dressed and had a dignified presence, but her face was filled with scars. She had been disfigured.

That old woman wanted to cleanse her face with poisonous water, so Chu Feng stepped in and stopped her. In their brief encounter, he learned that the old grandmother wasn’t sound of mind, but she was an incredibly powerful cultivator.

Later on, when Chu Feng encountered Xian Miaomiao, the latter told him that a mysterious expert had appeared in the Nine Souls Galaxy. The mysterious expert wielded extremely great power, such that she could easily defeat even the top experts of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

No one knew where the mysterious expert was, but they did notice that she kept chanting a name wherever she went—Hanxian.

That led Chu Feng into wondering if that mysterious expert could have been his grandmother.

Xian Miaomiao happened to have a portrait of the mysterious expert as well. Upon closer examination, Chu Feng realized that she was the mysterious grandmother whom he had encountered at Reincarnation Upper Realm’s Mount Ivory Valley. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He thought about how he felt a sense of intimacy toward the old grandmother during their brief meeting. He had thought of looking for her, but he was unable to find any traces of her.

He would have never imagined that the old grandmother whom he suspected to be his grandmother would actually be in a place like this.

The old grandmother was currently eyeing Situ Zhonglan with eyes filled with terrifying killing intent.

But what caught Situ Zhonglan’s attention wasn’t the old grandmother’s wrath but the golden flame rising from her body.

The golden flame contained seven streams of light that resembled seven majestic dragons. It was peculiar how it didn’t burn the old grandmother’s clothes or hair.

“Seven Levels Golden Dragon Flame! It’s the Seven Levels Golden Dragon Flame! You’re the daughter of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect’s sectmaster, Song Luoyi? You’re alive?!”

It was just a doubt at the start, but Situ Zhonglan quickly grew more and more certain of it.

Despite the old grandmother’s aged appearance, it was still possible to see faint traces of that woman in her memories through her facial features.

In truth, the old grandmother was actually much younger than her.

Back in those years, she was known as the prodigious daughter of Golden Dragon Flame Sect’s sectmaster, Song Luoyi.

The Golden Dragon Flame Sect was located in the same starfield as the Situ World Spiritist Clan. It was initially just the third strongest power of the starfield, nothing more than a puppet of the Situ World Spirit Clan, but everything started to change from the moment Song Luoyi revealed her talent.

She grew at such a swift speed that the Situ World Spiritist Clan felt threatened by her existence. So, they set up a ploy to frame the Golden Dragon Flame Sect before confronting them.

Needless to say, their goal was to get rid of Song Luoyi.

The Golden Dragon Flame Sect’s sectmaster had hidden Song Luoyi, so the Situ World Spiritist Clan inflicted cruel torture on every single sect member of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect in order to force her to appear.

The torture was none other than what the members of the Situ World Spiritist Clan were suffering at the moment.

Eventually, Song Luoyi did appear. It turned out that they had underestimated Song Luoyi’s strength.

She managed to hold her ground against the preceding patriarch and many experts of the Situ World Spiritist Clan for quite a while. She eventually fell in defeat, but she managed to inflict grievous injuries on the preceding patriarch as well.

Shortly after returning to the Situ World Spiritist Clan, the preceding patriarch passed away.

It just so happened that Situ Zhonglan had participated in that battle as well.

She was nothing more than a small fry back then, but the astounding prowess Song Luoyi had displayed that day was deeply imprinted in her head.

That day, the entire sky was covered in golden flames.

It burned countless of their experts to death, inflicting huge damage to the Situ World Spiritist Clan. Even to this day, they still hadn’t recovered from the blow they had suffered back then.

And this was all Song Luoyi’s doing.

Situ Zhonglan was certain that the person before her was none other than Song Luoyi. Despite her aged appearance, there was no mistaking her facial features.

Furthermore, the golden flame she was using was known as the Seven Levels Golden Dragon Flame. There was only one person who had managed to reach the highest level of the Seven Levels Golden Dragon Flame ever since the founding of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect, and that person was none other than Song Luoyi.

“How are you still alive? You’re supposed to be dead!” Situ Zhonglan exclaimed in horror.

Song Luoyi was someone whom the preceding patriarch had to put his life on the line in order to defeat. Her survival was a nightmare to the Situ World Spiritist Clan. There was no one in the current Situ World Spiritist Clan who would be a match for her.

Not to mention, there was no way Song Luoyi’s cultivation would have stagnated given her talents. She was bound to have become much stronger than before.

If Song Luoyi chose to exact vengeance on them, the Situ World Spiritist Clan would be doomed.

She also finally understood why Situ Duanyu would sense the guardian treasure of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect here in the Nine Souls Galaxy the other day. She thought that he had sensed wrongly since it didn’t seem plausible for the guardian treasure to appear here, but it seemed like his senses were spot-on.

The only problem was that the guardian treasure was on Song Luoyi.

“How could I die when your Situ World Spiritist Clan is still alive and kicking in this world?” the old grandmother spoke with a tone dripping with animosity.

She waved her hand.

Pupu!

Fresh blood splattered all around as Situ Zhonglan had her limbs severed and eyeballs dug out, just like her other clan members. Soon, she was tied to a tree with her head facing downward.

These members of the Situ World Spiritist Clan wouldn’t be dying any time soon, but their fate was already sealed. It was only a matter of time before the flicker of life was extinguished in them.

“I’ll obliterate the Situ World Spiritist Clan.”

Despite having punished Situ Zhonglan, the old grandmother’s hatred didn’t alleviate in the slightest. She spat with gritted teeth before leaving the area.

But shortly after, she suddenly slowed to a halt.

Her eyes that were initially blazing with anger and killing intent suddenly became empty, as if she had forgotten about her hatred and everything else.

A moment later, she began advancing at an unhurried pace, reminiscent of a soulless individual traveling aimlessly around the world. She was constantly murmuring a name.

“Hanxian… Hanxian…”
