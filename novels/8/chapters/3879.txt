Chapter 3879 - Sacrifice

The Mystic Cave Saints were a bunch that valued wealth as much as their lives. Especially treasures. For them, treasures held enormous enticement.

One could see how many remnants they’d entered, how many mystic places they’d explored, and how many treasures they’d obtained from how many strange treasures they had on them.

It would not be excessive to say that they’d entered all sorts of remnants and mystic places.

Doing that, it was inevitable that they would encounter many opponents. However, very few people were capable of causing them to fail to obtain any treasures.

That said, they’d encountered an extremely powerful opponent in the past too. As for that person, he was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted could be said to be a true expert.

His strength lay not merely in his cultivation and world spirit techniques.

He was also extremely experienced in exploring remnants and utilizing treasures.

It could be said that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was an expert tomb robber, an expert tomb robber superior even to the Mystic Cave Saints.

He was able to discover the remnant’s main formation’s formation core in a very short period of time, and gain control over the remnant’s power.

Practically all the remnants that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted appeared in meant that others had lost their chance to gain anything from them.

Even the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to compete with him in the slightest.

Back then, the Mystic Cave Saints had suffered miserably at his hands.

That was the reason why they were so shocked and frightened when they saw the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted again.

Their defeat from back then was still vivid in their minds. That defeat had left an enormous shadow in their hearts.

“Who would’ve known that the All-heaven Sect would actually manage to invite that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.”

“Big brother, what are we supposed to do now?” asked Eleventh.

“Don’t panic. When we were defeated by him last time, even I, was only an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.”

“Things are completely different now. We brothers have increased our world spirit techniques, and we’ve also gained a decisive opportunity by obtaining the acknowledgement of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor. We now possess the power of this tomb’s grand formation.”

“For him to show up here today, it will serve as the best opportunity for us to get our revenge," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“That’s right. We’ve been acknowledged by the Great Monster Slayer Emperor. We possess the power of this place’s grand formation.”

“Haha. Truly the heavens help us. For that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted to show up here now. The heavens have truly prepared a perfect opportunity for us brothers to get our revenge.”

The others of the Mystic Cave Saints came to a sudden realization after hearing what their eldest brother said.

They no longer felt any fear. Instead, they began to look forward to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s arrival. One by one, they became extremely excited.

“The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted came to our All-heaven Sect as a guest. He has merely come here to check things out today. He will not be doing anything.”

“Thus, we will have to trouble grandmasters with breaching the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb,” said Tuoba Chengan.

“I’ve long heard of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s famed name. It is my honor to meet him today. But, am I not able to see the famed Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted face-to-face?” as Grandmaster Ouyang spoke, he had a slight tone of regret.

“Humph.”

As for Grandmaster Huang, he let out a cold snort. There was a different sort of connotation in his snort.

Furthermore, after letting out that cold snort, he seemed to want to say something. However, in the end, he hesitated, and didn’t say anything.

“Forget about it. Since we’ve taken the money, we’ll naturally have to complete the task.”

“I will not concern myself with other things.”

“Brother Ouyang, let us begin.” Grandmaster Huang held the compass in his hand and looked towards Grandmaster Ouyang, who nodded.

Following that, the two of them began to utilize the compass to search for flaws in the spirit formation around the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

Soon, they discovered a flaw. Using their world spirit techniques, they breached that flaw.

A spirit formation entrance appeared before the crowd.

“Success! Lord Supreme Elder, we’ve finally succeeded!”

Seeing the spirit formation gate that appeared before them, the elders of the All-heaven Sect were all overwhelmingly excited.

After all, they’d tried to breach the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb multiple times over the years. However, without exception, they’d always conclude in failure.

And now, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb had really been breached. It would only be natural for them to be endlessly excited.

At that moment, the people from the All-heaven Sect were all eager to move. Should Tuoba Chengan give the order, they would immediately enter the spirit formation entrance.

They were all itching to see exactly what sort of treasures were in the mysterious Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

“The compass’ pointer is swaying nonstop. It is impossible to determine if the entrance is safe.”

“I suggest we explore things.”

As Grandmaster Huang spoke, he opened his palm, and a total of one hundred talismans appeared in his hand.

“Stick the talisman paper onto your dantians and enter. Regardless of life or death, I will be able to sense it.”

Grandmaster Huang handed the talismans to Tuoba Chengan.

Seeing that, the people of the All-heaven Sect that were extremely excited and eager to enter the opened entrance were immediately dumbfounded.

Even a fool could tell that Grandmaster Huang wanted Tuoba Chengan to find some people to enter the spirit formation entrance.

Why would he want people to enter the spirit formation entrance?

The purpose was very simple—to die. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As it was impossible to determine if the interior was safe, he wanted people to go in and explore things.

If it was safe, they would be able to return safely. However, if it wasn’t safe, they would be throwing their lives away.

“Grandmaster Huang, we asked you to come here so that you could breach this spirit formation and determine the dangers.”

“How could you have us go in and explore the path?” complained a Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect.

“The compass is unstable. It is unknown if there are dangers inside, yet you want us to go in and explore things?”

“Disregarding the rewards, if something is to happen to us, who would dare help you all breach this Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb?” asked Grandmaster Huang.

“This...” The elders of the All-heaven Sect were all at a loss as for how to respond.

“Lingxiong.” [1. Lingxiong could mean either Brother Ling or Esteemed Brother. Or... it could be the dude’s name.]

Right at that moment, Tuoba Chengan turned his gaze behind him to the bunch wearing black gowns and masks.

Once Tuoba Chengan spoke, a person immediately passed through the crowd and arrived beside Tuoba Chengan.

“Milord.”

That person immediately clasped his fist respectfully after arriving beside Tuoba Chengan.

That said, he merely clasped his fist, and did not bend his back or get on his knees.

“Lingxiong, you heard what Grandmaster Huang said earlier, no?” asked Tuoba Chengan.

“I have. But...” That person hesitated.

After all, this was a matter that concerned life and death. No one would be willing to do such a risky thing.

Knowing what Tuoba Chengan wanted him to do, he would naturally not be willing to accept the mission.

“The help you needed from us is quite extensive.”

“Could it be that you all are unwilling to even pay such a small price?” asked Tuoba Chengan.

“Milord, I understand,” that man came to a decision.

He accepted the hundred talisman papers, selected a hundred people from the group of black-clothed mask-wearing men, and told them to place the talismans on their dantians.

The men he selected were very obedient. Even though they knew they might die, no one voiced any complaints.

Then, at the same time, those people entered the spirit formation entrance opened by the two grandmaster world spiritists.

However, they had only entered the spirit formation entrance for a short period of time when the compass started trembling violently.

Seeing that, the two grandmaster world spiritists started frowning. A look of alarm appeared on their faces.

“It’s this dangerous?!”

“We couldn’t possibly shoulder such a task.”

“I’ll return you your reward.”

Grandmaster Ouyang took out the reward he had accepted earlier and tossed it to Tuoba Chengan.

No matter how Tuoba Chengan tried to urge him to stay, it was useless.

That Grandmaster Ouyang soared into the sky and, in the blink of an eye, disappeared far away.

He had fled extremely quickly.

However, that was not what was important. What was important was how panicked he was. That was something witnessed by everyone present.

From his reaction, the crowd knew that the hundred people that had entered the entrance earlier must’ve all died.

Furthermore, the danger level of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb was much greater than they’d anticipated. Otherwise, how could a grandmaster world spiritist bolt like that?

“Elder Tuoba, I am not trying to make things difficult for you.”

“However, the level of danger this time has far exceeded my anticipation.”

“Even if we have the assistance of the compass, it will still be very difficult to open the true entrance.”

“You will have to increase the reward,” said Grandmaster Huang.

“Grandmaster, go ahead and tell me how much more you want,” said Tuoba Chengan.

“Ten times more,” said Grandmaster Huang.
