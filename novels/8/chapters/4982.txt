Chapter 4982: Qualified

After a quick conversation, Chu Feng learned that the Godwish Grandmother and the others had successfully opened the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound, and they discovered treasures in it.&nbsp;

Those from the Totem Galaxy got greedy and wanted to take the treasures for themselves, so they tried to get rid of the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea.

Fortunately, the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea were prepared for that, which was why they had Song Xue’er stay behind to protect the juniors.

However, they had underestimated the prowess of the elders. They didn’t think that Song Xue’er would be tied down by them.&nbsp;

In any case, the others who had tried to make a move on the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea had all been slaughtered, and they had successfully secured the treasures they had found in the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound too.&nbsp;

The treasures were relics of the Monstrous King, and they were mostly martial skills and Exalted Armaments.&nbsp;

It was possible that there were other more treasures in the depths of the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound, but it was impossible to tell because they were unable to enter its depths.

“Why aren’t you able to enter its depths? Could it be that the seal hasn’t been fully lifted?” Song Yun asked, clearly concerned about the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound.&nbsp;

“We’re not sure either, but the entrance to the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound reacted when Lele came close to it. There might be some kind of restriction allowing only juniors to enter its depths, but it’s a little weird since Lele wasn’t able to pass through its entrance too.&nbsp;

“I think that it would be best for you all to head there and take a look. Young friend Chu Feng, you should come along as well,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.&nbsp;

The ‘Lele’ she spoke of was none other than Wang Yuxian. It was her pet name. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Elder, I brought another person with me here, and she’s a junior too. Could she come with us as well?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. Young friend Chu Feng’s friend is our friend too,” the Lady of Dao Sea replied.

“Zi Ling, come out,” Chu Feng said.

The moment Zi Ling revealed herself, everyone’s eyes were naturally drawn to her. Chu Feng was the only man in the vicinity, but somehow, everyone was still mesmerized by her beauty. Even amongst all of the ravishing women gathered here, she still stood out like a goddess amongst mortals.&nbsp;

“What a beautiful big sister! Big brother Chu Feng, where did you meet her?”&nbsp;

Song Yun ran over to Zi Ling’s side and looked at her with twinkling eyes filled with fondness. Zi Ling responded to the compliment with a polite smile.&nbsp;

It was apparent to her from Song Yun’s earlier gaze that she was no ordinary person.

“Allow me to introduce her to you. She’s Zi Ling, my fiancee.”

Chu Feng reached out to pull Zi Ling into his embrace as he spoke.&nbsp;

Those words astonished the crowd, especially Song Yun.

“Big brother Chu Feng, how are you so lucky as to be able to snag such a gorgeous big sister? I swear that I’ve never seen anyone as beautiful as she is. You must have accrued lots of good karma in your previous lives!” Song Yun exclaimed.&nbsp;

The others also lavished compliments on Zi Ling, though it was clear that it was just pleasantries. Most of them weren’t too concerned about Chu Feng’s relationship with Zi Ling.

After a short chat, they made their way toward the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound.&nbsp;

Throughout the entire duration, Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian remained hidden in the shadows. It was not that Chu Feng was guarded against the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea but the two of them didn’t want to show themselves.&nbsp;

After a short journey, Chu Feng finally arrived at the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound.&nbsp;

Rather than to say that it was an ancient remnant, it resembled a buried underground city more. It was hidden beneath the ground before, but the thick layer of soil above it had been removed, thus exposing its true form.&nbsp;

As a result, Chu Feng and the others could see the massive underground city in its full splendor from above.&nbsp;

It was apparent that the Monstrous King was prepared to make this place his tomb from the very start.&nbsp;

There was something in the heart of the massive underground city that caught Chu Feng’s eyes. It was a pair of gates leading into an underground passageway. There was a layer of black mist shrouding it, preventing entry.

The black mist wasn’t spirit power or martial power, but it wielded strong defensive prowess. It felt like only those who had reached Half God level would have a chance at breaking it.&nbsp;

“It doesn’t seem likely for there to be a restriction specifically for juniors,” Chu Feng said.

It shouldn’t be possible to impose restrictions on it since it wasn’t a formation.

“The black mist reacted earlier when Lele came close to it. I know that it isn’t a formation, but I think it’s built specifically for juniors. Young friend Chu Feng, you should try approaching it with Lele and the others and see what happens. Don’t worry, we’re here to protect you,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng and the others stepped forth and made their way toward the heart of the underground city.

Weng!

The black mist started reacting as soon as Chu Feng and the others approached the city. Out of cautiousness, the group halted their footsteps.

“Don’t worry, we’ll protect you,” the Lady of Dao Sea urged them to continue on.

Thus, Chu Feng and the others continued advancing toward the heart of the city.&nbsp;

Bam!

The black mist suddenly gushed into the sky, causing the crowd to eye it warily.

It morphed into the form of a humanoid monster that was around ten meters tall with a brawny body. There were massive horns on its head, but it was hard to properly discern its appearance.

Both the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea immediately rushed forward to stand in front of Chu Feng and the others.

The black mist didn’t emanate any threatening aura, but the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea were still on their guard. They couldn’t break through the black mist earlier, so the humanoid monster manifested from it was bound to something dangerous.&nbsp;

While everyone was feeling nervous, the humanoid monster made out of black mist began speaking.

“Only the most talented juniors are allowed to enter Lord Monstrous King’s Soul Mound. In your group, there are only three people who qualify.”
