MGA: Chapter 1830 - Slaughter With A Point Of One’s Finger

“This... what is this?” At this moment, the War Faction’s Martial Emperor was panicking. Although they were both red gaseous substances, the fiery red gaseous substance that formed the Bloodline King Monstrous Dragon had actually become an entire size smaller. Not only that, it was actually also trembling violently. It was as if it was afraid of thee crimson gaseous substance that Chu Feng had emitted.

Furthermore, he himself was also able to sense how frightening the crimson gaseous substance that Chu Feng had emitted was.

The sensation he felt made it seem as if that crimson gaseous substance was simply not something of this world. Rather, it was a gaseous substance that had originated from the depths of the underworld. It was like a devil from the underworld that had been unleashed to exterminate all living things in the world. Thus, the killing intent being emitted by that crimson gaseous substance was simply incomparable.

Indeed, the crimson gaseous substance was much more frightening than the Bloodline King Monstrous Dragon that he had summoned.

Most importantly, at this moment, that crimson gaseous substance had completely surrounded him. Even if he wanted to escape, he was already unable to do so.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, two enormous beams of light appeared on either side of Chu Feng.

“No!!!” Upon seeing those beams of light, the War Faction’s Martial Emperor cried out in surprise. He was extremely terrified.

The reason for that was because those two enormous beams of light were not merely composed of light. Rather, they were two enormous eyes. They were the eyes of that crimson gaseous substance. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, when the eyes appeared, a crescent-shaped enormous crack appeared underneath the crimson gaseous substance. The crack began to distort back and forth. It was extremely frightening and sinister to look at.

It was only when that pair of eyes appeared that the War Faction’s Martial Emperor noticed, upon looking at the crack again, that it was not simply a crack. Instead, it was an opened mouth. It was the mouth of that crimson gaseous substance.

That crimson gaseous substance was not only a gaseous substance. Rather, it possessed life. It did not resemble a devil. Rather, it was the devil itself.

“Today, I shall let you experience a true Heaven Taboo Martial Skill,” Chu Feng said.

“Heaven Taboo Martial Skill?! This is a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill?!”

“How are you capable of unleashing such a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill?!” The War Faction’s Martial Emperor let out an incomparably frightened voice and revealed a gaze of disbelief.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly raised his hand and pointed at the War Faction’s Martial Emperor.

“Boom~~~”

A loud sound was heard. The Bloodline King Monstrous Dragon that the War Faction’s Martial Emperor had turned into was destroyed instantly. He had been utterly killed.

Seeing this scene, Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor were unable to contain themselves from gulping down a mouthful of saliva.

With merely a point of his finger, Chu Feng had eliminated the Bloodline King Monstrous Beast that the War Faction’s Martial Emperor unleashed with the price of his life.

They knew that it was not that their King Monstrous Dragon Race’s taboo technique, the Bloodline King Monstrous Dragon, was too weak. Rather, it was that Chu Feng’s Heaven Taboo Martial Skill was too powerful.

“Is that really a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill?” Yaojiao Tingyu muttered in shock.

She had seen Heaven Taboo Martial Skills before. However, the one that Chu Feng had unleashed seemed to be even more frightening than the ones that she had seen.

“Indeed, it’s a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill. Merely, although they’re all Heaven Taboo Martial Skills, their strengths are dependent on their user. It could only be said that Chu Feng’s mastery of martial skills is simply too powerful. Under the same level of cultivation, even if his opponents also possess Heaven Taboo Martial Skills, they will likely still be no match for him,” the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor said.

“That guy, he is truly excessively powerful,” Although Yaojiao Tingyu was saying it like that, the gaze that her beautiful eyes were looking at Chu Feng with were filled with adoration.

As fellow members of the younger generation, she was not envious of Chu Feng’s talent. Rather, she felt pride because of Chu Feng, and viewed him as her idol.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly waved his sleeve. He casually sprinkled a spirit formation below him. The spirit formation actually turned into limbs and dispersed onto the ground. Then, Chu Feng leapt, and arrived beside Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor.

After he landed, Chu Feng raised his hand and covered the three of them with a concealment formation.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing?” Yaojiao Tingyu asked in a very surprised manner.

Although what Chu Feng had formed with his spirit formation were mutilated body parts, Yaojiao Tingyu was able to recognize that the mutilated body parts were those of Chu Feng, the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor and herself.

“You’ll know soon enough. Just patiently wait a bit,” Chu Feng said in a deliberately mystifying manner.

After hearing what Chu Feng said, Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor became even more curious. Thus, they no longer asked questions, and turned their gazes to the scene of devastation that Chu Feng had set up.

The following moments were eerily silent. After an entire hour passed, a figure cautiously appeared.

After that figure appeared, Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor were both surprised. The reason for that was because the person that had appeared was Yaojiao Xueran.

Although Yaojiao Xueran’s body possessed scars from being burned, he was not badly injured. Likely, the War Faction’s Martial Emperor had protected him. Else, with his abilities, it would have been impossible for him to survive being besieged by a flock of Underworld Fire Bugs.

“Humph!!!”

Yaojiao Xueran was actually extremely cautious. It was only when he saw the mutilated body parts scattered all over the ground that he revealed a complacent smile. Then, he turned around and began to quickly leave the tomb.

“Chu Feng, why are you not killing him?” Yaojiao Tingyu asked.

“Why should we kill him?” Chu Feng asked.

“Isn’t this the best opportunity to eliminate Yaojiao Xueran? If he is to escape, we would not be able to eliminate him anymore,” Yaojiao Tingyu said.

“No. If we are to kill him now, we would have given them a chance to escape,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, what are you talking about? Why is it that I don’t understand?” Yaojiao Tingyu looked to Chu Feng with a confused expression. The Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor beside her had the same expression as her.

“While I can kill Yaojiao Xueran, how are we to report what had happened here to the elders? If we are to speak the truth, Yaojiao Ba will definitely refuse to admit it. In fact, he might even bite back at us.”

“Without any proof, even if the elders knew that something had happened, they would, for the sake of the King Monstrous Dragon Race, cover up this matter. Afterall, Yaojiao Xueran and the three Martial Emperors from the War Faction had all been killed. They would not wish for more lives to be sacrificed,” Chu Feng explained.

“Then, your intention is?” After hearing what Chu Feng said and thinking about it herself, Yaojiao Tingyu seemed to have realized something. Merely, she was not certain.

“Just wait to watch a show. Follow me,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he undid the concealment formation and removed the mutilated corpses on the ground. After finishing all his preparations, he then walked toward the direction in which Yaojiao Xueran had left.

Truth be told, Chu Feng was actually very tempted upon seeing the Incomplete Imperial Armament and the Cosmos Sack on the floor. Merely, as they belonged to the King Monstrous Dragon Race, Chu Feng could not touch them.

..................

At this moment, outside of the Dragon King’s Tomb, Yaojiao Guang, Yaojiao Ba, the elders of the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the top experts of the King Monstrous Dragon Race, as well as Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang, were all present.

Other than Yaojiao Guang and the others that were using all their strength to continue to keep the entrance of the tomb open, the rest of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang were staring at the entrance of the tomb with fixed eyes. They were awaiting the return of Yaojiao Tingyu and the others.

“Woosh~~~”

Finally, a figure flew out from the entrance.

Seeing that someone had come out, the crowd were all in joy. However, the very next moment, their expressions all turned stiff, and revealed panic and worry.

The person that came out was Yaojiao Xueran. Merely, at this moment, not only was Yaojiao Xueran’s face covered with tears, he was also wounded all over. After coming out, without saying anything, he kneeled before the elders with a ‘putt.’

With a weeping and shivering voice, Yaojiao Xueran said, “Lord Elders, Lord Father, Lord Clan Chief, the situation is extremely bad!”

“Xueran, what happened to you? What happened in there?” At this moment, the first to react was Yaojiao Xueran’s father, Yaojiao Ba. Without worrying about anything else, he stood up and began to examine his son’s body. It was only when he discovered that there were no fatal wounds that he heaved a sigh of relief.

“Xueyan, who caused you to be in such a state?” The four elders asked.

“It’s Chu Feng. Chu Feng was trying to plunder Lord Dragon King’s inheritance. Not only did he kill Princess Tingyu, he also killed the seniors. If it wasn’t for the fact that the seniors protected me with their lives, even I would not have been able to return alive.”

“I was useless. I was incompetent. I was too weak. It was all because of the seniors protecting me that they ended up losing their lives,” Saying those words, Yaojiao Xueran appeared to be grieving even more.
