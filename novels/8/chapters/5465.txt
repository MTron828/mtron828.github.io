Chapter 5465: I’ll Bring You to a Good Place

“Lord Qin Jiu didn’t leave behind many treasures, but each of them is an incredible item that can be passed down as a family heirloom even for powerhouses like our Totem Dragon Clan. There’s no doubt that he must have been a great world spiritist in the Ancient Era,” Long Kuitian said respectfully.

Chu Feng was not surprised upon hearing the name ‘Qin Jiu’. After all, that was the strongest world spiritist in the Ancient Era. He rose above the others with his world spiritist techniques and even came to be known as the World Spiritist Emperor. His world spirits were also formidable, as could be seen from Taowu.

In fact, Chu Feng could be said to be Qin Jiu’s successor. It was only after inheriting Qin Jiu’s legacy that his world spiritist techniques rose to their current height.

Long Kuitian took out a token.

A whiff of teleportation energy flowed out from the realm and enveloped the group, pulling them into the realm. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When the teleportation energy dispersed, Chu Feng and the others were already on a pedestal surrounded by towers that rose into the sky and floating palaces. It was a magnificent sight.

A group of people was already waiting for them upon their arrival. They first bowed to Long Kuitian, Long Chengyu, and Long Suqing before the leader humbly reported a matter to them. The one who had conspired with Jia Lingyi back at the World Spiritist Mountain to kill Chu Feng and Long Muxi, Long Rui, had escaped.

“I informed you of it right away. How could you allow him to flee?”

Long Kuitian was infuriated. He thought that he could punish Long Rui as soon as he returned, but the latter actually got away. He felt insulted to be given the slip by someone like that.

“Lord Long Kui, we quickly moved in on Long Rui as soon as we received your orders, but that scoundrel was prepared. He had already escaped through a teleportation formation by the time we arrived. We tried tracking his teleportation formation, but we couldn’t figure out where it led,” the leader replied indignantly.

“You’re saying that he was already prepared for that,” Long Kuitian asked.

If that was truly the case, there was likely more to this matter than he had initially thought.

“It’s only normal. That scoundrel must have received benefits from not just the Pill Dao Immortal Sect but the other powers too. I reckon that he must have done many things to sully our name even before this incident. He must have known that such a day would come.” Long Chengyu was surprisingly much calmer about this matter.

He proceeded to inform the leader of Chu Feng’s identity and instructed him to prepare accommodations.

However, Long Muxi quickly interjected and said, “There’s no need for that. I’ll house him.”

“This person is?” The Totem Dragon Clansmen turned to look at Long Muxi.

“This is Miss Muxi. Greet her,” Long Kuitian replied.

Astonished, the others quickly bowed deeply to Long Muxi and said, “Paying respects to Miss Muxi! We were foolish to have not recognized and greeted Miss Muxi right away. Please punish us for our lapse in etiquette!”

There weren’t many people who recognized Long Muxi, as she rarely showed herself before others, even within the Totem Dragon Clan. They were aware that the people accompanying Long Chengyu were likely to be esteemed guests, but their pride as Totem Dragon Clansmen hindered them from humbly greeting outsiders.

It was only now that they realized that they had committed a fatal mistake, which was why they flew into a fluster.

“Forget it. You didn’t know better. Bring Miss Muxi and young master Chu Feng to their palace to rest,” Long Suqing said with a wave of her hand.

The Totem Dragon Clansmen did as they were told.

With them leading the way, Chu Feng and Long Muxi were able to reach Long Muxi’s territory with no impediment despite very few people recognizing her. Her territory was huge, boasting a size even larger than the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

Even so, Chu Feng and Long Muxi could swiftly travel anywhere within the territory with their current level of cultivation, not to mention that there were many teleportation formations around.

Long Muxi assigned a bamboo hut at a mountain peak for Chu Feng’s accommodation.

“Chu Feng, you take a rest here first. I have some matters to attend to. I’ll look for you later,” Long Muxi said.

Even though she didn’t explain why she assigned Chu Feng to the bamboo hut, he still grasped her goodwill. Her territory was a land blessed with rich natural energies, but the mountain peak had the highest concentration of natural energies, and this was regulated by a formation.

When Chu Feng stepped into the bamboo hut, he felt the rich natural energies becoming much tamer. It nourished his mind and revitalized him. Cultivating inside the bamboo hut would have been many times more efficient than doing so outside.

Powerhouses really had far better cultivation resources than ordinary cultivators.

“Long Muxi isn’t good at expressing herself, but she really treats you well,” Eggy said.

Chu Feng didn’t deny that. It was evident from how she was willing to set up a scheme against Jia Lingyi to stand up for him. Someone of her standing wouldn’t do something like that unless she truly saw him as a friend.

Chu Feng didn’t cultivate even though this place was extremely suitable for cultivation.

Such a place would have been a dream for him in his younger years, but to the current him, it was only of minimal help. He crossed his legs and started examining the protection formation his father had left inside him.

His trip to Painter Mountain had been a fruitful one. He had found a medium for his Dao of Absolute Darkness and forged the powerful secret art, Dark Plunder, but aside from that, he had also obtained a powerful formation named Protection Bane.

Right now, he was using Protection Bane to examine his father’s protection formation.

His cultivation was already strong enough for him to become a powerhouse in the Eastern Region, but he was still too weak compared to the vast world of cultivation. It would take time for him to raise his cultivation, so he needed to find a means to protect himself in the meantime.

Controlling his father’s protection formation was one way to go about it.

However, Long Muxi returned shortly after and said, “Chu Feng, I’ll bring you to a place.”

“All right,” Chu Feng replied.

“Aren’t you going to ask me where I’m taking you to?”

“Since I’m the guest here, I’ll follow you wherever you wish to take me to.”

“Aren’t you worried that I might harm you?”

“There’s no need for you to do it in such a roundabout fashion if you truly harbor such intention. We’re currently in your turf,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

Long Muxi laughed as well. “It’s a good place. You might get something good out of it.”
