MGA: Chapter 870 - Returning to the Misty Peak

“Lord Chu Feng, have mercy! Lord Chu Feng, have mercy!”

Suddenly, a person at the peak of the palace knelt onto the ground, and started kowtowing at Chu Feng, begging for forgiveness.

Chu Feng had already shown his power. Even Lord Yan of the Immortal Execution Archipelago was no match for him, so naturally it was impossible for any of them to defeat Chu Feng.

“Lord Chu Feng, have mercy! We haven’t joined the Immortal Execution Archipelago yet! We were forced to show up here! Lord Chu Feng, I ask for a clear judgement! We truly wouldn’t dare to impudently make an enemy out of the Crippling Night Demon Sect!”

After that person, many others atop the palace knelt orderly. Other than Monk Pingjing, who refuted the head of the Stone Sword Sect, everyone else knelt on the ground.

“HAVE MERCY—”

The most famous people in the Winter Plains knelt and asked for forgiveness. No matter if it was the elders or disciples from the Stone Sword Sect, or the elders or disciples from other places, all of them kowtowed and begged for mercy.

Seeing the terrified crowd, Chu Feng lightly smiled, then said, “I know you were forced here, so I won’t do anything to you. But, remember this well. If there is anyone who dares to make the Crippling Night Demon Sect an enemy, or join the Immortal Execution Archipelago, these two are how your life will end.”

Suddenly, a hint of fierceness emerged into his eyes. A special power was sent from his palm, and like a flame, enveloped the bodies of Shi Jingtian’s and Lord Yan’s Consciousness, starting to burn and refine them.

“AHH—”

“Chu Feng, you bastard! I curse you! Even as a ghost, I will not forgive you!

“AHH—”

When they were set ablaze by such special flames, Lord Yan and Shi Jingtian felt endless pain. Even though they had already lost their physical bodies, they were still able to feel the pain of their Consciousness being refined.

Just like that, as they crowd gazed upon them, they were refined, slowly. It only ended when they completely disappeared from this world.

After refining their Consciousness, Chu Feng suddenly waved his sleeve. An invisible shock wave spread out and enveloped the entire Stone Sword Sect.

Quickly after, upon another wave of his sleeve, several cries of terror rang out from the crowd. At the same time, several people flew over towards Chu Feng as they rolled around in the air.

However, before they reached Chu Feng, they were turned into pools of blood amidst muffled explosions resembling firecrackers.

“These are those who followed that old bastard Shi Jingtian and killed members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. They deserve death.

“But the rest of you... are very innocent. So, I will spare all of you today. However, I advise you to do what’s good for you.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After Chu Feng spoke, he moved and became a stream of light, flying towards the Teleportation Array.

“Thank you Lord Chu Feng for your mercy, thank you Lord Chu Feng for your mercy!”

Even after Chu Feng left, the people in the Stone Sword Sect still didn’t dare to rise. They continued to kneel and kowtow while giving their thanks. One could tell they were truly quite frightened by Chu Feng.

Only after a good while, after confirming Chu Feng had left, did they dare to fly up like frightened group of birds.

No matter if it was the people from the Stone Sword Sect, or the people from other forces, they were escaping with everything they had. They wanted to quickly leave this dangerous zone of disaster.

After finishing that up, Chu Feng immediately went towards the Misty Peak through the Teleportation Array.

As he travelled, Eggy had asked Chu Feng why he didn’t kill everyone from the Stone Sword Sect as a warning.

Chu Feng said that the head of the Stone Sword Sect deserved to be killed, and that Lord Yan deserved to be killed. However, there were some people who could not be killed.

Right now, he was a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. His very actions represented not only himself, but also the entire Crippling Night Demon Sect.

Thus, even though the people had indeed gathered at the Stone Sword Sect’s plaza, and technically speaking they were slightly related to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, they had, as they said, yet to truly join the Immortal Execution Archipelago. So, they could be killed, yet could also not be killed.

Rather than commencing a massacre, which would frighten the world, why not make a clear line between grudges and favours? That would also let the world know the people of the Crippling Night Demon Sect were not insane, nor would they kill the innocent.

With that, it could avoid evoking fury from the population, and it could also, to a certain degree, prevent more and more forces from joining the Immortal Execution Archipelago.

Moreover, Chu Feng anticipated after today, the people from the Stone Sword Sect would leave the Stone Sword Sect. Not only would they leave, it was likely they wouldn’t even dare to continue living in the Winter Plains and would scatter to various areas in the Eastern Sea Region.

And, as they were interspersed amongst the Eastern Sea Region, they would also spread today’s events to various places. They would let those who wished to join the Immortal Execution Archipelago know the result was death if they were to make the Crippling Night Demon Sect an enemy.

It would also let the people who misunderstood the Crippling Night Demon Sect know that they weren’t as ferocious as they had imagined. In reality, they were just a sect who knew the line between favours and grudges. They only treated their enemies fiercely.

After a while of hurrying, Chu Feng finally returned to the Misty Peak. After he did, he discovered that Chun Wu had returned as well.

He knew because she was currently standing at the entrance to the Misty Peak.

Chun Wu wasn’t the only one there. Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei were also standing at the entrance. Those four, as they stood there, were chatting quite merrily.

As for the reason, it was quite simple. Clearly, they were waiting here for Chu Feng because after they noticed he was there, they all revealed joyous expressions. They flew up and welcomed him.

“Chu Feng, you’ve finally returned!”

When they saw Chu Feng, they were very happy, especially so for Zi ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei. On their faces, there was not only happiness, there was also peace. One could tell when Chu Feng had left, these three fiancées had worried about Chu Feng quite a bit.

“Junior Chu Feng, your cultivation! You’ve actually...” On the other hand, Chun Wu had noticed Chu Feng’s change in cultivation. He had made breakthroughs, and it was even two levels continuously. He had caught up to Chun Wu.

“Waa, Chu Feng, you’ve made a breakthrough again?” After hearing Chun Wu’s words, Zi Ling and the others also noticed Chu Feng’s rise in cultivation. Right now, he had become a rank five Martial Lord.

“Heh, I have indeed gotten some unexpected harvests at the Burning Heaven Church.” Chu Feng nodded with a light smile.

“Ha, this is truly good news! However, after Senior Zhang and Brother Wushang, who’ve impatiently awaited your return, learn of this, I wonder if they will be a bit dispirited,” Su Mei said with a smile. Moreover, there was a smirk on her face.

“Little Mei, what do you mean?” Chu Feng’s face was full of confusion.

“Heh, Chu Feng, after you left, Senior Zhang and Brother Wushang went in seclusion for training. They wanted to catch up to your level, and right now, they have already made a breakthrough. Both have entered the ninth level of the Heaven realm.

“But, looking at it now, I’m afraid their wish will be denied because our Chu Feng hadn’t stopped improving and instead, improved at an even quicker speed than them!” Su Mei said with giggles.

“Eh... This...” There was some shame on Chu Feng’s face after he heard that.
