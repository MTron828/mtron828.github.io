Chapter 4225 - Mysterious Three

A mountain stood like a sharp sword and pierced through layers of white clouds into the clear sky.

This mountain was so tall that not even martial cultivators could see the tip with their naked eyes.

At the bottom of the mountain was an enormous stone gate.

A signboard was suspended above the stone gate. Four words were written on the signboard. They were especially eye-catching.

‘Dao Comprehension Cave Dwelling!’

[1. Cave Dwelling is where immortals live.]

A person was sitting cross-legged outside the Dao Comprehension Cave Dwelling’s stone gate.

Before the enormous stone gate, that person appeared extremely small. There was no need to mention how small they were when compared to the giant mountain.

However, that person was emitting an extremely astonishing disposition of might.

Multicolored light filled the sky. The abnormal sign formed by the light covered even the clouds in the sky.

That person was the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s most distinguished disciple, the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

The All-seeing Heavenly Master had used a special type of treasure to set up an extraordinary spirit formation.

This was a prophecy ceremony.

The All-seeing Heavenly Master was using her gift to perform a prophecy.

“Puu---”

Suddenly, the All-seeing Heavenly Master’s expression turned ugly. Then, without any indication, she sprayed out a mouthful of blood.

Once she vomited the blood, the multicolored light disappeared from the sky. Her grand disposition of might had also begun to disappear.

The accident had forced the half-completed prophecy ceremony to a halt.

“Disciple, what happened?”

An aged yet powerful voice sounded from inside the stone gate.

“Master, this disciple was incompetent. I failed to successfully prophesy the result of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain,” the All-seeing Heavenly Master replied.

Her voice was extremely humble and filled with reverence. There was even a slight amount of fear present.

The reason for that was because the person she was speaking with, the person inside the stone gate, was the strongest world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s cultivation was most definitely not the strongest in the Holy Light Galaxy.

But, his world spirit techniques were without a doubt the strongest.

Whilst the battle power of his world spirit techniques could not match the top martial cultivators, his world spirit techniques were capable of accomplishing things that martial cultivators could not.

Because of that, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted held an extremely high status in the Holy Light Galaxy.

The All-seeing Heavenly Master also held a high status in the Holy Light Galaxy because of her prophecies.

But, compared to her master, her status and reputation were far inferior.

“Why would such a thing happen?” The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s voice sounded from behind the stone gate again.

“Master, there’s likely some sort of power protecting it.”

“Or perhaps there’s an even stronger prophecy covering the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain,” replied the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

“Even stronger prophecy?”

“You mean to say that someone has prophesied the results of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain?” asked the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“Master, that is very possible.”

“Unfortunately, this disciple’s ability is limited. I am unable to say so with certainty,” said the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

“Are you truly unable to do anything?” asked the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“This disciple is incompetent,” the All-seeing Heavenly Master lowered her head. She expressed how powerless she was.

“Forget it. Since we’re unable to make a prophecy, it simply means that everyone will have to rely on their own abilities.”

“Your junior brother and others have left ahead of time. It’s about time for us to set off too,” said the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“But master, this disciple...” The All-seeing Heavenly Master was slightly hesitant.

“You’re worried about that little girl from the Dragon Clan?” asked the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“This disciple was incompetent. I coveted riches but failed to kill them. Instead, I exposed my intentions to them. They definitely won’t be willing to leave the matter alone.”

“It is one thing for this disciple to incur trouble upon myself. But, this disciple has also affected master’s reputation. This disciple is guilty,” said the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

“Heh...” The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted chuckled, “What would they dare do to me?”

“Disciple, there’s no need to fear.”

“You are the disciple of this Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted. Whilst they might be from the Dragon Clan, they’re nobodies. How could they possibly dare to touch you?”

“I’m telling you to accompany me. Go ahead and prepare yourself,” said the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“Yes, master.”

As the All-seeing Heavenly Master spoke, she stood up. A smile had finally appeared on her face.

Those were exactly the words she had been waiting for.

Whilst the Dragon Clan was very powerful, Long Xiaoxiao had lost her influence.

As long as the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted was willing to protect her, neither Long Xiaoxiao nor Long Shengbu would be able to do anything to her.

But, after the All-seeing Heavenly Master turned around, she was suddenly stunned.

Not only did her smile suddenly freeze, but a frightened look also appeared in her eyes.

She was shocked to discover that there were three figures standing behind her.

Those three people were all enveloped by treasures with light circulating through their bodies. Thus, she was unable to see their appearances.

But, that wasn’t what was important. What was important was that the All-seeing Heavenly Master had not noticed their appearance at all.

They had appeared behind her without her detecting them at all.

But, even if the All-seeing Heavenly Master possessed world spirit techniques inferior to her master, she was still a renowned world spiritist with extremely powerful perception!

Her failure to detect them made her realize that they were extraordinary individuals.

Whilst she was terrified by them, the All-seeing Heavenly Master soon composed herself, and asked with a furious tone, “Who are you all?”

“You dare trespass upon my master’s cave dwelling?!”

Even if their strengths surpassed her own, her master, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted was present. Thus, she was not afraid of them.

After all, she knew very well how powerful her master was.

“What sort of place this is doesn’t matter. What matters is... that you’re here,” said the mysterious person standing in the middle. That person had a male voice. Judging from his voice, he was very young, and could even be a person of the younger generation.

“Master!”

The All-seeing Heavenly Master began to panic.

She not only discovered that those three people had come for her, she also noticed that they didn’t seem to be afraid of her master.

The All-seeing Heavenly Master immediately fell back and backed herself onto the stone gate.

She was requesting her master’s help.

“What are you panicking for? No matter what, you’re someone with status.”

“Besides, with this Exalted here, who would possibly dare to do anything to you?”

The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s voice sounded. His voice caused the foot of the mountain to tremble slightly. Then, with a rumble, the heavy stone gate began slowly opening.

Soon, an aged figure appeared.

The old man that appeared was rather tall. He wore noble attire.

Yet, he still gave off the air of an immortal.

That said, he did not look like a benevolent individual at all.

Especially between his eyebrows. One could clearly see a look of viciousness.

He was the renowned Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“All-seeing Heavenly Master, we did not come here with malice.”

“We’ve merely heard that you’re proficient in making prophecies, and came to seek your assistance with something,” the young man among the three mysterious individuals said.

His eyes were fixed onto the All-seeing Heavenly Master the entire time, and completely ignoring the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

This caused the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted to feel great displeasure.

The three mysterious individuals hadn’t placed him in their eyes from the very start.

Since when did someone of his caliber receive such contempt?

“Did the three of you know that intruding upon this Exalted’s cave dwelling is a capital offense?!”

“Apart from the people from the Holy Light Clan, no one dares come here unsolicited!”

The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted spoke with a stern voice. His tone was extremely hostile.

The three mysterious people were all clad in the power of a treasure. That treasure was extremely strong. Not even he could see through it.

He knew that the three people must possess grand origins. But, even so, he was not afraid. Instead, he was determined to make a scene should the three of them refuse to provide him with a proper explanation for their behavior.

This was the stubbornness of the strongest world spiritist.

“Holy Light Clan? Who do you think they are?” said the young man.

When the Holy Light Clan was mentioned, visible contempt was present in his attitude.

Hearing those words, the All-seeing Heavenly Master and Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted were in complete disbelief.

No one would dare disregard the Holy Light Clan in the Holy Light Galaxy. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After all, the Holy Light Clan was the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy. Who would dare blaspheme the overlord?

Suddenly, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted shouted angrily, “You dare disrespect the Holy Light Clan?! You have committed a capital offense!”

Following that, the surrounding space started to distort as enormous power erupted from his body and flew straight towards the three mysterious individuals.

The power was no small matter.

It was the power of a Martial Exalted.

A rank one Martial Exalted!

That was the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s cultivation.

Very few people in the Holy Light Galaxy could bring fear to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

But, the Holy Light Clan was capable of making him afraid.

Those three people had dared to insult the Holy Light Clan. Naturally, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted could not put up with them.

That was the reason why he had unleashed his might to attack them.
