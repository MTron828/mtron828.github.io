Chapter 5620: Destined For Fame, Zhang Yingxiong

Chu Feng quickly snapped out of his peculiar state, and his fighting prowess reverted to normal. He noticed two flaws with his breakthrough.

One: His relative fighting prowess within the cultivation rank had slipped.

For instance, when he raised his cultivation to rank six Half-God level, his fighting prowess was far stronger than his peers, such that few rank six Half-God level cultivators could put up a fight against him. However, when he further raised his fighting prowess to rank seven Half-God level, his strength was only comparable to an average rank seven Half-God level cultivator.

It was one thing if he was fighting against those from the older generations, but none of the juniors who had reached his cultivation level were pushovers. If his opponent was a rank seven Half-God level junior instead, he would have struggled much more or even lost the match.

Two: He noticed that he became exceptionally cold, emotionless, and even bloodthirsty when he raised his fighting prowess. It was possible for him to do something irrational in such a state.

He was anxious to save Eggy, but he also knew that haste makes waste. He needed to become stronger so that he could better save her. Thus, he continued exploring the mountain.

Soon, by circumventing all of the slaughter formations, he arrived at the innermost depth of the mountain range. On the peak of a relatively smaller mountain was a small lake filled with water from the Immortal Stream.

Chu Feng dived into the lake and used the method Zhang Yingxiong had imparted to him to absorb the energy inside the lake. It didn’t take him long to assimilate all of it.

The wounded portion of his soul started to heal due to the influx of energy from the Immortal Stream’s water.

“It looks like the fortuitous encounters in this place are all related to the Immortal Stream,” Chu Feng remarked.

He left the mountain range to look for another fortuitous encounter. It wasn’t long before he cleared another trial and arrived at another lake filled with water from the Immortal Stream.

All of the rewards in this place appeared to be the Immortal Stream’s water. While its quantity was nowhere compared to the boundless lake realm, it was still useful to the tempering of his body and soul.

Chu Feng proceeded to seek a more fortuitous encounter, and thanks to his careful selection, he was rewarded every single time. This continued until a surge of teleportation energy enveloped him and brought him out of the Nine Realms Immortal Region.

He wasn’t the only one teleported out, as more and more figures appeared around him. These were the people who had entered the Nine Realms Immortal Region with him, and they looked dazed due to how abrupt the eviction was.

However, they soon noticed some changes with the Nine Realms Immortal Region.

The Nine Realms Immortal Region dissipated in a whiff of aura before forming massive words in the sky.

The Nine Realms Immortal Region was created out of the Immortal Stream’s water to nurture the strongest prodigies and bring blessing to the world.

Should a choice arise between nurturing a top-notch prodigy and the masses, the Nine Realms Immortal Region chooses the former.

Thus, when someone achieved the feat of opening all eight gates, the Nine Realms Immortal Region opened its hidden realm, which contains over nine-tenth of the Immortal Stream’s water.

The record holder has stepped into the hidden realm and depleted the Immortal Stream’s water. This concludes the Nine Realms Immortal Region’s mission.

The one who has achieved this feat is the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s Zhang Yingxiong.

“Zhang Yingxiong? Who’s that?”

“I have never heard of him before.”

“Such a prodigy actually came out of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?”

The crowd was taken aback. While they knew a junior from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy had opened all eight gates of the Nine Realms Immortal Region, they didn’t think that he would be this formidable as to completely deplete the Nine Realms Immortal Region.

This feat was enough to forge Zhang Yingxiong’s name in the world of cultivation. It wouldn’t be long before everyone heard about his name.

“Chu Feng,” a sweet voice suddenly echoed.

Chu Feng turned over and saw Long Xiaoxiao. She was accompanied by her master, Ningyu Shangren.

“Xiaoxiao,” Qin Hang called out and walked over.

Behind him were the experts from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.

Weng!

Before Qin Hang could say a word, they were wrapped by a powerful surge of martial power and dragged to a remote location. This was Ningyu Shangren’s doing. She didn’t want too many people to know about their existence.

“Chu Feng, how are your gains?” Qin Hang asked with a warm smile.

Ningyu Shangren and the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect Members were stunned. They thought that Qin Hang would be hostile toward Chu Feng given his feelings for Long Xiaoxiao, or at the very least, he wouldn’t have been this warm.

After all, Qin Hang had even berated Chu Feng before this.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It was not bad. What about you?” Chu Feng asked.

“Mine is not bad too,” Qin Hang thumped his chest out and spoke gleefully. However, he quickly asked, “You’re from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy too. Have you heard of Zhang Yingxiong?”

“I’m afraid not,” Chu Feng replied, not wanting to divulge Zhang Yingxiong’s identity.

“What about you, Junior Xiaoxiao?” Qin Hang asked.

“I’ve never heard about him either,” Long Xiaoxiao shook her head and replied.

She had met Zhang Yingxiong and even crossed blows with the latter, but she wasn’t aware of his name, so it was impossible for her to tie the two together.

“Elder, do you have a good understanding of Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Chu Feng asked Ningyu Shangren.

“I do, but just on a superficial level. Is there anything you wish to know?” Ningyu Shangren asked.

“I heard that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has plenty of Saint-level treasures that can strengthen one’s world spiritist techniques. Is there anything that is beneficial to world spirits, such as enhancing their physical body or soul?” Chu Feng asked.

What Eggy needed right now was something that could reinforce her body and soul, something similar to the Immortal Stream’s water but even more potent and effective on world spirits.

“Saint-level treasures are the highest level of resources for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. I have no doubt that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has treasures similar to what you have described, but I’m not sure if they are Saint-level treasures,” Ningyu Shangren said.
