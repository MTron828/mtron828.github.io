Chapter 3609 - The Immemorial Era

“You wish to die in understanding?”

“Very well, even if I don’t take that little stutterer into consideration, taking the fact that you’ve helped this old man into consideration, this old man should allow you to die in understanding.”

“Likely, you’ve heard a lot of legends. However, legends are merely legends. They do not represent the truth.”

“What this old man will tell you is the truth. They are things that truly happened in the past.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Our era is known as the Ancient Era by you all. However, there is actually an even older era than our era. That era was the true era that cultivators originated from.”

“We call that era the Immemorial Era.”

“Immemorial Era?” Hearing that name, Chu Feng’s heart trembled.

It was as the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had said, Chu Feng had heard a lot of legends regarding the Ancient Era. However, those were only legends. No one knew if they were real or not.

However, this Blood-devouring Demon Exalted came from the Ancient Era. His words were most likely true.

To Chu Feng and the others, the Ancient Era was a very mysterious period of time.

Due to the fact that very rarely were traces of experts from the Ancient Era discovered, the people of the world did not know much about the Ancient Era.

They only knew that there were a lot of powerful martial cultivators in the Ancient Era. Furthermore, a lot of powerful treasures, martial techniques and weapons all originated from the Ancient Era.

Thus, it was publicly accepted that the martial cultivators from the Ancient Era were stronger than those of the present era.

However, never would Chu Feng have imagined that before the Ancient Era was an Immemorial Era.

“Actually, many things regarding the Immemorial Era are merely legends too. However, some of those things were verified to be true.”

“Wuu~~~”

After saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted suddenly placed his hand on his head. Even though Chu Feng could not see his expression, he was able to tell that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was in great pain.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s painful situation lasted for a long while before he finally started to gain relief.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted sighed. Then, he continued, “This head of mine, it’s forgotten again.”

“Young friend Chu Feng, to tell you the truth, this old man has been wounded. I will frequently forget my memories of the Ancient Era. Because of that, there are a lot of things that I cannot remember.”

“Even if I am able to recall them when my head is fine, I will soon forget about them.”

“Thus, I am sorry. Young friend Chu Feng, I am unable to help you die with clarity,” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said.

“Senior, please allow me to die with understanding. I don’t need you to tell me about the Immemorial Era, you don’t even have to tell me about the Ancient Era. But, at the very least, you should tell me exactly what it is that’s in my body, no?” Chu Feng said.

“It’s not that I don’t want to tell you. It’s just that I am truly unable to recall it. This old man has no reason to lie to you,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

Seeing the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted acting like this, Chu Feng was unable to determine if he had truly forgotten about it, or if he suddenly didn’t wish to tell him about it.

However, he was certain of one thing. Likely, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was going to attack him.

“Woosh~~~”

Thinking up to that point, Chu Feng suddenly waved his arm.

The Evil God Sword in his hand moved with his wave and streaked across the sky.

“Woosh~~~”

Crimson sword rays formed a crescent. It was like wind and light. However, it was extremely sharp. It made a straight line for the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

However, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted did not even move when confronting the sword ray. He merely waved his hand.

“Clamor~~~”

Suddenly, a strong wind swept forth.

The sword ray Chu Feng had shot forth immediately vanished on impact with the wind. As for Chu Feng himself, he was shot flying.

The wind shattered all things before its path. As for Chu Feng, he was knocked into the wall, leaving a deep crater in the thick stone wall.

“This power?”

Chu Feng cried out in his heart. The power of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted far surpassed his imagination.

Likely, he was even more difficult to handle than that Demon King in the world created by the little girl.

“Is this all you’re capable of? If this is all you’re capable of, how did you pass the trial?”

“Could it be that, after all these years have passed, that thing has decided to lower the standards of its trial?”

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted spoke again. He seemed to be talking to himself, but was actually ridiculing Chu Feng.

He was ridiculing Chu Feng for being so weak.

“Zzzzz~~~”

Suddenly, crimson lightning appeared. Chu Feng unleashed another attack. This time around, crimson lightning was present in the sword ray.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted sighed. He once again waved his hand and sent forth another gale.

Although the gale appeared to be very ordinary, it was completely unrivaled.

Even with an all-out attack from Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword, it was unable to match the gale.

The imposing sword ray was once again dispersed.

Chu Feng, who was already pushed into the wall was once again battered by the violent wind. He felt the bones of his body shattering. Even his soul was injured by the attack.

“Puu~~~”

Blood sprayed forth. Chu Feng felt that he had lost his ability to continue fighting. Even though he was still holding onto the Evil God Sword, he was unable to fight anymore.

Chu Feng had imagined that he might lose. Merely, he had not expected to lose so quickly.

“Paa~~~”

However, Chu Feng had no time to lament as a hand appeared before him.

It was the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had arrived before Chu Feng. His distance from Chu Feng was less than three meters.

“Drop dead.”

Chu Feng clenched his teeth. He unleashed all the power within him and brandished the Evil God Sword again, thrusting it toward the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

This thrust was extremely fast. The light of the sword flashed through. It was aimed straight at the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s dantian.

It landed!!!

However, when the thrust landed on the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, Chu Feng felt that he had hit an invulnerable barrier. Not only did he fail to injure the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, but the impact of the thrust left his palm dripping with blood.

No, it was not only his palm. Instead, it was his entire arm. His entire arm was completely lacerated, and seemingly destroyed.

“It’s better that you don’t use that sword anymore.”

“The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted grabbed Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword.

At the instant when the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted grabbed the Evil God Sword, Chu Feng was able to see power visible to the naked eye flowing out from the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s palm to cover and infuse into the Evil God Sword.

That was spirit power!!!

Extremely powerful spirit power. It was spirit power that surpassed Saint-level spirit power.

With eyes filled with shock, Chu Feng blurted out, “Divine-cloak World Spiritist?!”

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted smiled gently. He said, “True Dragon.”

“True Dragon?!!!!”

Hearing those two words, enormous alarm overwhelmed Chu Feng’s heart. Shortly afterward, he asked, “True Dragon World Spiritist?”

“It would appear that you possess some knowledge,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

Upon learning the answer from the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, Chu Feng felt completely defeated.

Despair. It was truly despair.

In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Saint-cloak World Spiritists were the strongest.

The Utmost Exalted level of cultivation was also the strongest.

However, before him was a True Dragon World Spiritist.

Chu Feng knew about True Dragon World Spiritists.

When he was interacting with Grandmaster Long Xuan, Chu Feng had chatted with him a lot.

During their chats, he had asked about world spiritists.

From Grandmaster Long Xuan, Chu Feng had learned that Divine-cloak World Spiritist was not the strongest realm world spiritists could reach.

Above Divine-cloak World Spiritist was an even stronger realm, the True Dragon World Spiritist.
