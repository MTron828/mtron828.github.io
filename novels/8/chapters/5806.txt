“All right.”

The others in the group answered. Some formed hand seals, and some took out treasures. Their eyes started revealing special traits, as they resorted to their detection means.

It was not just Chu Feng, Ling Xiao, and Jie Baobao who had detection means. In truth, most cultivators had their own detection means too.

“Did you find anything?” Chu Feng asked.

“I sense spirit power in the sand. It’s so faint that it’s almost imperceptible, but it can induce illusions when at the scale of this vast desert, though it’s unlikely to work on us. Also, there are likely secrets hidden inside this desert. That should be what we’re looking for,” Ling Xiao said.

“You have said as good as nothing,” Long Chengyu remarked with a sigh.

“He did at least point out the presence of an illusion formation in the desert, though it doesn’t work on us,” Qin Xuan tried to help.

“...” Ling Xiao was at a loss for words. He was simply saying what he had observed thus far, though they seemed to be of no help.

“W-w-what about the two of you? Did you notice anything?” Wang Qiang asked.

“We aren’t world spiritists. We didn’t notice anything,” Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan replied.

“Yy-you’re worse than Ling Xiao,” Wang Qiang remarked.

“What about you, Brother Wang Qiang? Did you notice anything?” Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan asked.

“Heh! I-I-I am different from you l-l-lot. I am decent at w-w-world spiritist techniques, but my analysis is the same as Ling Xiao’s,” Wang Qiang said.

“...” Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan rolled their eyes. You might as well just keep quiet. Besides, who knows whether what you said is true? You might just be copying Ling Xiao here.

In the end, Wang Qiang was the same as the rest of them—useless.

“Miss Jie, what about you?” Chu Feng asked Jie Baobao.

Chu Feng noticed that most people simply casually looked around the area before giving up. There were only three people aside from him who earnestly scanned the area, and two of them were Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao. Thus, he figured it’d suffice to ask the three of them.

“My conclusion is the same as Ling Xiao. I’ll need to conduct a more thorough investigation of the entire desert to uncover more. It’ll be time-consuming, but it should be fruitful,” Jie Baobao said.

“All right.” Chu Feng nodded before finally turning his attention to Little Fishy. “What about you? Found anything?”

Little Fishy held a fistful of sand in her hand, moving it around as if she was fooling around. She was the last person who was earnestly scanning the area aside from Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao.

“Ah? Big brother, did you say something?” Little Fishy was so focused on the sand that she was startled when Chu Feng called out to her.

“Yes. You were so focused on the sand. Did you notice anything?” Chu Feng asked.

“Big brother, I think there are three remnants here. These three remnants may appear independent, but in truth, they serve as locks. If we can clear these three remnants, we’ll be able to uncover what’s hidden in the desert,” Little Fishy said.

“Miss Yu’er, have you been here before?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I haven’t.” Little Fishy shook her head.

“Have you read any records about this place?” Qin Xuan asked.

“I haven’t.” Little Fishy shook her head again.

“D-d-did you figure that out from your earlier observation?” Wang Qiang asked.

“That’s right.” Little Fishy nodded.

“Are you serious? Miss Yu’er, how did you figure out so much?”

The group was in disbelief, especially Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao. Little Fishy’s analysis was so thorough that it felt as if she had read a record about this place before. If she was right, it would mean that her senses were much keener than theirs.

“I didn’t expect you to have such sharp eyes. That makes things easier,” Chu Feng said.

“Big brother, is my observation right?” Little Fishy asked.

The group’s astonishment deepened. Little Fishy’s analysis was likely mostly correct, or else Chu Feng wouldn’t have complimented her.

“You’re spot-on,” Chu Feng replied. He quickly drew out a complete painting of the blood-colored desert and indicated three locations on it.

“These are where the remnants are hidden. Little Fishy is right. These remnants serve as a lock. We’ll have to remove these locks to uncover the true secret behind the desert. However, there’s a sequence to removing the locks. First and foremost, these two remnants.”

Chu Feng pointed to two of the remnants before adding, “We’ll have to simultaneously clear these two remnants before clearing the third one. Only then will the true secret surface. What makes things more difficult is that these remnants begin their countdown as soon as we step into their premises.”

“From the moment we step in?” The group was confused.

“These remnants each have a formation. A countdown will begin as soon as we step into the detection area of the formation,” Chu Feng replied.

“Does that mean we’ll have to split ways?” Ling Xiao asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“I’ll go with big brother.” Little Fishy immediately walked over to Chu Feng’s side.

“That won’t do, Little Fishy. You’ll have to go with Ling Xiao and the others. You'll be able to help them with your sharp eyes,” Chu Feng replied.

“Fine.” Little Fishy was reluctant to part ways with Chu Feng, but she compromised and deferred to his judgment.

Chu Feng took one remnant by himself, whereas the others headed for the other remnant. Both groups would have to enter and clear the remnant at the same time as each other for it to count as a clear. To do so, they agreed on the times they should enter and clear the remnant.

Chu Feng was only worried that Ling Xiao and the others couldn’t clear the remnant on time.

Once they cleared the two remnants, they would head to the third remnant and unite there.

“Chu Feng, I have a question,” Ling Xiao suddenly spoke up.

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I trust you when you said that you don’t know this place well, but how did you figure out so many clues within such a short period of time? It’s almost as if everything is within your grasp.” Ling Xiao was baffled.
