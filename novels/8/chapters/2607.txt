Chapter 2607 - The Formation Cleared, The Treasures Gone

“Rumble~~~”

The rumbling was not only happening inside the Unknown Burial Ground; even the desert outside was rumbling violently.

“What is happening?!”

At that moment, the expressions of Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, who were standing before the grand formation, changed.

Their change in their expressions was due to their worry toward Chu Feng’s safety. After all, they were all able to tell that the Unknown Burial Ground would not rumble like that without a reason or cause. Something abnormal must’ve happened.

However, not only did the rumbling show no sign of stopping, but it instead grew more and more ear-piercing. Furthermore, they were able to clearly sense that the desert was trembling violently.

“Xunyi, move back.”

Seeing that the situation was amiss, Ying Mingchao immediately grabbed Zi Xunyi and moved away from the grand formation.

“Rumble~~~”

At practically the same moment the two of them left the grand formation, the Unknown Burial Ground that was covered by the grand formation immediately surged with smoke.

After that, the Unknown Burial Ground sunk in, forming an enormous pit.

Furthermore, the radius of that sunken pit was still expanding nonstop. It greatly surpassed the area covered by the grand formation.

With the situation being like that, the crowd all soared into the sky and began to move away from that region.

The reason for that was because they were filled with dense fear toward the Unknown Burial Ground.

Even though it was merely the desert caving in, they still did not dare to linger in the sky above it. Only by escaping to a distance where they felt safe would they be at ease.

“Why would this be happening? Could it be that Chu Feng failed?”

Zi Xunyi was extremely nervous. In truth, it was not only her. Many others present also felt that Chu Feng might have failed.

After all, this was the first time that they had ever seen such an abnormality. Subconsciously, they started to think that it was a crisis.

“No, I must go down and save Chu Feng,” At that moment when everyone was cowering away from the Unknown Burial Ground, Ying Mingchao suddenly changed directions and arrived above the sky of the Unknown Burial Ground. He was planning to enter the Unknown Burial Ground.

“Mingchao, have you gone insane?” Right at the moment when Ying Mingchao turned around, Zi Xunyi also followed after him. She stopped him.

“Xunyi, Chu Feng saved my life. Now that he’s in trouble, I cannot ignore it,” Ying Mingchao said.

“Chu Feng had already broken through the Life and Death Formation. He is most likely not in danger. If he is fine, yet something is to happen to you because you wanted to save him, how would Chu Feng feel? He would most definitely blame himself,” Zi Xunyi urged.

“Xunyi, you can rest assured, I will definitely pay attention to my own safety. If I encounter something unexpected, I will immediately leave,” Ying Mingchao said.

“Very well. In that case, I will accompany you,” Zi Xunyi said.

“Xunyi, you...” Ying Mingchao felt lost as to what to do upon hearing what Zi Xunyi said.

After all, all the things he had said earlier were lies. For the sake of saving Chu Feng, he would be willing to bear any danger.

As such, he would naturally not be willing to have Zi Xunyi accompany him down.

While he could bear dangers, he did not want Zi Xunyi to bear dangers together with him.

At the same time inside the Unknown Burial Ground. The collapse was still ongoing. Merely, the collapse did not affect Chu Feng and the others inside.

A power had sealed off the region. Thus, that region did not collapse.

“Senior, exactly what is happening here?” Chu Feng asked the yellow-gowned old man.

“Back then, I made a bet with a person. Because of that bet, we created this game.”

“To clear this game, one cannot just pass through all three checkpoints. Instead, one must first pass through all three checkpoints, and then give to another what one has obtained afterwards.”

“Back then, I felt this to be impossible. How could anyone be willing to give what they had obtained with their life to another?”

“However, never would I have expected that she was right, never would I have expected that there really would be a foolish boy like you.”

“Thus, boy, you have made this old man lose the bet,” After the yellow-gowned old man said these words, his gaze suddenly changed.

Sensing the gaze from the yellow-gowned old man, Chu Feng’s heart immediately grew tense. A chill emerged in his heart.

Killing intent. In that one moment, Chu Feng actually felt killing intent.

However, that sort of sensation only lasted for an instant. It arrived so rapidly and left so rapidly that Chu Feng felt that it might be his misperception.

This was especially true when Chu Feng saw the yellow-gowned old man beaming with a smile on his face. He became even more uncertain as to whether the killing intent he had felt in that one instant was real or fake.

“Senior, may I know your distinguished name, and who created this game along with senior?” Chu Feng asked. He knew that as the Unknown Burial Ground was collapsing, the yellow-gowned old man would soon leave too. Likely, if he did not ask those questions now, it would be very difficult for him to obtain an answer to those questions in the future.

Actually, Chu Feng merely wanted to remember their names so that he could repay them should the opportunity present itself in the future. After all, no matter what, if it wasn’t for this game of theirs, he would not have obtained the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.

Although the journey was difficult, and he was indeed seen as a chess piece in another’s game, Chu Feng was someone who was grateful toward those that helped him.

“Knowing too much will serve no benefit to you. Go on and leave this place. Also, do not mention the things regarding me to anyone.”

As the yellow-gowned old man spoke, a faint light emerged in his eyes. The next moment, Chu Feng felt that he was covered by some sort of power. He turned around and discovered that Zhao Hong was in the same situation as him.

The light grew brighter and brighter. It grew so intense that Chu Feng was no longer capable of seeing his surroundings.

However, the intense light soon started to gradually vanish. When the light vanished, Chu Feng discovered that he was outside of the Unknown Burial Ground.

A vast crowd was present there. They numbered in the tens of thousands. Furthermore, they were all cultivation experts. They were all from different sects and powers.

That group of people were looking at the Unknown Burial Ground that had already caved in and were in utter panic.

“Chu Feng! Look, it’s Chu Feng!!!”

As there were many people, someone soon discovered Chu Feng.

Once the news of Chu Feng being seen was spread, everyone turned their gazes toward Chu Feng.

“Success! He succeeded!”

The guardian clan’s clan chief, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua were all overjoyed.

The reason for that was because not only did they see Chu Feng, but they also saw the person beside Chu Feng, Zhao Hong. Both of them... were safe and sound.

“Chu Feng, is it really you?”

Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi arrived before Chu Feng together. Ying Mingchao was extremely emotional. He was so emotional that he did not dare to believe his eyes.

“Senior Ying, Senior Zi, I have made you two worry,” Chu Feng said.

“How did you two get out? What happened to the Unknown Burial Ground?” Ying Mingchao asked.

Once his questions were asked, the crowd present all grew quiet. They all started to silently look toward Chu Feng, awaiting his answer.

They were all very curious as to what had happened after Chu Feng broke through the Life and Death Formation. They wanted to know why the Unknown Burial Ground ended up disappearing.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, a ray of light suddenly emerged from the center of the Unknown Burial Ground and shot straight toward the sky.

Soon, the light started to spread and formed six large characters.

‘The formation cleared, the treasures gone!!!’

Seeing the six enormous words in the sky, everyone’s heart tightened.

When they looked to Chu Feng again, the crowd, to a greater or lesser degree, all revealed gazes of admiration. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

There was no longer a need for them to ask Chu Feng anymore. The reason for that was because those six large characters had already given them the answer.
