Chapter 3842 - Unfair

“Little brat, you think someone like you is capable of contending against us?”

“With your mere ability as an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, any one of us can beat you up till you’re looking for your teeth all over the floor now."to said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Is that so?”

Chu Feng smiled. As he spoke, he released his spirit power.

Seeing the spirit power released by Chu Feng, the expressions of the crowd present, with the exception of Yin Zhuanghong, all changed.

It was only at that moment, that they realized Chu Feng was actually a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

“Little brat, you actually managed to make a breakthrough?!”

Even the eleven men of the Mystic Cave Saints felt extremely surprised.

“Do you dare to fight against me?” asked Chu Feng.

“This is a gambling match. If you want to compete against us, that’s fine too. However, you’ll have to put forth a gambling stake of value first,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“I will use my life as the gambling stake," said Chu Feng.

Once Chu Feng said those words, the expressions of the crowd all changed enormously.

This was especially true for Yin Zhuanghong. She looked at Chu Feng with an extremely complicated gaze. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She had never expected Chu Feng to be willing to gamble with his life because of the business of their Red-dress Holy Land.

“Little brat, you said you’re going to use your life as the gambling stake?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“That’s right, I’m putting forth my life. If you all are to lose, you merely have to hand over that rope. However, if you are to win, not only will you be able to obtain this bead, but you can also take my life," said Chu Feng.

“Little brat, never would I have imagined that you’re actually quite bold.”

“I don’t know if you’re really that confident in yourself, or if you truly don’t fear death.”

“But, little brat, we are only interested in treasures. We are not interested in your life at all," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Even if you agreed to it, our Red-dress Holy Land would not have allowed young master Asura’s life to be the gambling stake," said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“After she finished saying those words, she looked to Chu Feng. “Young master Asura, are you truly willing to fight on behalf of our Red-dress Holy Land?”

“Lady Headmaster, Miss Yin Zhuanghong is my friend. Her business is my business.”

“Besides, I have grievances with these Mystic Cave Saints to begin with.”

“Back in the World Spirit Mansion Gate, I used the power of my spirit formation to suppress them. Because of that, I actually won with an unfair advantage.”

“Today, I wish to use my own ability to teach them a lesson,” said Chu Feng.

“Very well. Young master Asura is truly courageous and insightful. I, Han Xiu, admire you.”

After the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster finished saying those words, she cast her gaze to the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Woosh~~~”

As she spoke, she tossed the case she held in her hand to the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

This scene brought great distress and heartache to the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land.

As for the Mystic Cave Saints, they were wild with joy.

Even though their facial appearances were covered, one could imagine how overjoyed they must look.

After all, inside that case was the Red-dress Holy Land’s Holy Land Protection Treasure, something the Mystic Cave Saints yearned for day and night.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right at that moment, a dazzling light soared into the sky.

That light was rainbow-colored. The dazzling rainbow light dyed the entire sky rainbow.

That light came from the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster’s hand.

A gem had appeared in her hand.

The gem seemed to contain seven different living creatures. Each living creature was a specific color, and they could be seen spiraling in the gem.

Most importantly, the aura emitted by that gem was incomparably strong.

That gem was a rare treasure. Not only was it capable of being used to train, but it was also a rare treasure that could be used to refine weapons.

Even though Chu Feng was unable to see the faces of the Mystic Cave Saints, he was able to sense their gazes.

Chu Feng was able to sense how excited and overjoyed they were when their gazes landed on the gem.

“Ancient Era’s Rainbow Stone.”

“That’s a treasure even more precious than that Spirit Formation Cultivation Bead.”

“Headmaster Red-dress, what is your intention behind taking out that Ancient Era’s Rainbow Stone?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Mystic Cave Saints, do you all dare to gamble once more?”

“If you all are willing to gamble once more, I am willing to use this Ancient Era’s Rainbow Stone as the gambling stake," said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“If you want to gamble again, that’s fine too. However, I will not use the YinYang Soulsealing Rope as the gambling stake again.”

“If you are to win, you will only be able to win back your Spirit Formation Cultivation Bead. However, if you are to lose, that Ancient Era’s Rainbow Stone shall belong to us,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Despicable! Shameless!”

“That’s right! You yourself declared the Ancient Era’s Rainbow Stone to be more valuable than the Spirit Formation Cultivation Bead.”

“Even if it’s a gamble, you should use a treasure of equivalent value to gamble, or allow us to put forth conditions. How could you decide to use anything as the gambling stake just because you feel like it?”

The elders of the Red-dress Holy Land expressed their discontent.

“Everyone, you need to understand your situation. It is you all who want to gamble with us again.”

“It is not us who are forcing you to gamble with us again.”

“Regardless, that is my condition. If you are willing to gamble with that condition, then we will gamble. If you’re unwilling, we can forget about gambling," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints in a very indifferent manner.

“You...”

The Red-dress Holy Land’s elders all gnashed their teeth furiously after hearing those words. However, they were helpless to do anything.

After all, what the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints had said was reasonable too.

“Young master Asura, we’ll have to trouble you.”

The Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster looked to Chu Feng. There was a slightly questioning look on her face.

Seeing that, Chu Feng understood that the YinYang Soulsealing Rope must be extremely important to the Red-dress Holy Land.

Otherwise, they would not have spent such effort for the sake of obtaining it, even going as far as to gamble with the badly reputed Mystic Cave Saints.

Even after the Mystic Cave Saints put forth an unfair agreement, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster was still willing to accept it.
