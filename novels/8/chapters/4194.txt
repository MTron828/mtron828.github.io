Chapter 4194 - She’s My Woman

In the upcoming days, Chu Feng was unable to avoid chatting with the Golden Crane True Immortal.

Chu Feng learned that the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk were good friends of many years and had been exploring a remnant together. It was in that remnant that they’d gotten sucked into the sealed world.

Furthermore, they’d arrived there not long after they’d left the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

As for Chu Feng, he told the Golden Crane True Immortal some things about himself.

For example, he’d mentioned how he was Chu Xuanyuan’s son, and that he had returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The Golden Crane True Immortal was very surprised to learn those things.

As Chu Feng had not wished to expose his identity as Chu Xuanyuan’s son, neither the Golden Crane True Immortal nor the plain-clothed old monk had known about it.

Whilst they might have suspected it to be a possibility, they had given up on the idea after seeing how adamantly Chu Feng had refused to admit it.

As such, it was only natural for the Golden Crane True Immortal to feel shocked after learning that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan’s son, and that he had been acknowledged by the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After all, Chu Xuanyuan was someone that held a special status in the Golden Crane True Immortal’s heart.

Back then, Chu Xuanyuan had been known as the genius of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

It was not only the Chu Heavenly Clan. The Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed monk had also placed high hopes on Chu Xuanyuan.

However, later on Chu Xuanyuan had ended up being imprisoned by the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Because of that, the Golden Crane True Immortal and others had felt very sad and pained.

If Chu Feng was truly Chu Xuanyuan’s son, the status he held in the Golden Crane True Immortal’s heart and the expectations the Golden Crane True Immortal had for him would change too.

That said, the Golden Crane True Immortal did not dare believe in Chu Feng’s claims too much.

He still suspected that he had suffered some shock after finding himself in the sealed world.

After all, he had even proclaimed himself to be an Utmost Exalted-level expert.

Because of that, the Golden Crane True Immortal was skeptical about Chu Feng’s proclamations that he was a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan and Chu Xuanyuan’s son.

That said, he was not anxious either. He believed that Chu Feng would return to normal sooner or later.

At that time, the truth would be revealed.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that Zhao Menglu would visit Chu Feng every day.

Furthermore, she would prepare dimsum and meticulously brewed soup for Chu Feng.

At times, she would even take the initiative to bring Chu Feng around and teach him about different places.

In short, she was showing meticulous consideration for Chu Feng like a considerate little servant girl.

Unfortunately, Zhao Menglu was not Chu Feng’s type. Furthermore, Chu Feng knew what her intentions were.

In order to make sure she did not become delusional, Chu Feng kept his distance from her the entire time.

Just like that, time passed quickly.

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.

During those five days, Chu Feng had not been able to use his martial power or spirit power.

In fact, he was incapable of even training.

However, when the people outside saw him, they would immediately swarm him excitedly.

Because of that, Chu Feng had decided not to go to places with a lot of people. He had decided to find a quiet place to stroll around.

At that moment, Chu Feng had arrived at a forest. He happened to find some fruits in the forest.

After taking a bite of a fruit, he found it to be extremely bitter, so much so that he immediately tossed it away.

But soon, he was shocked to discover that the bitter fruit he had swallowed had caused his cultivation to recover slightly.

“This fruit is able to accelerate the speed at which my cultivation returns!”

Soon, Chu Feng confirmed his guess.

He became wild with joy, and started searching for more such fruits. Just like that, he continued further and further into the forest.

However, as he continued to walk further into the forest, Chu Feng heard some voices. Amongst them was Zhao Menglu’s voice.

He also heard other voices besides hers.

But, if that were all, Chu Feng wouldn’t bother to pay attention. After all, he didn’t like Zhao Menglu to begin with, and didn’t want to interact with her too much.

If it wasn’t for her coming over to find him and being excessively forward, so much so that Chu Feng found it impossible to refuse her, he would simply not bother with her at all.

However, it just so happened that Zhao Menglu and the others were discussing him.

This made Chu Feng extremely curious. Because of that, he stealthily approached them.

After approaching, Chu Feng discovered that two women and five men were standing together with Zhao Menglu.

Amongst them was a man with a tall and robust build. He seemed to have a very intimate relationship with Zhao Menglu, as he was actually holding her in his chest.

The others did not show any signs of discomfort towards this sight.

Evidently, they all knew that Zhao Menglu had an extraordinary relationship with the man.

“Menglu, you couldn’t have possibly really fallen for that Chu Feng, right?”

“It’s been a long time since I last saw you.”

“I heard that you’ve been preparing dimsum for him every day?”

The man’s voice was filled with jealousy.

“Big brother Xiao Yu, didn’t I just tell you that I was forced to do so by my grandpa?”

“How could I fancy a fool like him?” said Zhao Menglu.

“Fool? Didn’t Lord Golden Crane say that Chu Feng is a genius cultivator?” asked a woman standing on the side.

“Genius cultivator? Pah! More like a genius boaster.”

“You all don’t know about this, but when my grandpa asked him what his cultivation is right now, guess what he said?” said Zhao Menglu.

“What did he say?”

The crowd were all curious.

“He said he’s actually an Utmost Exalted,” said Zhao Menglu.

“What?!”

“Utmost Exalted?”

“Hahaha. He’s a fool alright.”

The people burst into roaring laughter.

“Menglu, perhaps I should go and tell your grandpa about our relationship?”

“No matter what, I, Xiao Yu, am a peak Martial Ancestor. How could your grandpa not agree to our relationship?” said the man hugging Zhao Menglu.

“Big brother Xiao Yu, if you were a peak Martial Ancestor that was also less than a hundred years old my grandpa would definitely agree to it.”

“But big brother Xiao Yu, you’re over a thousand years old already. As for me, I’m only five hundred years old. My grandpa might not agree to it,” said Zhao Menglu.

“So you’re actually five hundred years old. That’s the age of an old woman.”

Suddenly, a voice sounded. The tone of the voice was extremely mocking.

The sudden voice instantly shocked Zhao Menglu and the others.

After all, they were discussing secret matters there and did not wish anyone else to know about their discussions.

“Who is it?! Get out here!” Xiao Yu shouted loudly at the forest.

“It’s me. What about it?”

Holding a thin branch and a bitter fruit, Chu Feng swaggered out from the forest.

“Chu Feng?!”

Although Chu Feng had only been there for five days, he was already a celebrity.

As such, they all recognized him.

When they saw Chu Feng, Zhao Menglu and the others were all shocked.

After all, they had been speaking ill of him earlier.

“Chu Feng, it was a misunderstanding, this was all a misunderstanding.”

Zhao Menglu was the person that panicked the most. She actually threw off Xiao Yu’s embrace and ran over to Chu Feng.

She was very afraid of Chu Feng. Rather, she was very afraid of the Golden Crane True Immortal and her grandpa. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Especially the Golden Crane True Immortal. He had the cultivation of a peak Martial Immortal, and was the strongest person there.

With how highly the Golden Crane True Immortal thought of Chu Feng, she would naturally not dare to offend him.

However, after seeing Zhao Menglu’s fearful look and how she ran toward him, a look of ruthlessness flashed through Xiao Yu’s eyes.

“Misunderstanding my ass!”

As Xiao Yu spoke, he stepped forward and stopped Zhao Menglu by hugging her. He then pointed at Chu Feng, “Trash, you’ve come at the perfect time. Today, I will have you understand one thing.”

“What?” asked Chu Feng.

“Menglu is my woman. You’d best keep your distance from her from now on,” said Xiao Yu.
