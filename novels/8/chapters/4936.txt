Chapter 4936: A Gentle Gaze

“I heard that the Zhuge Clan’s defensive formation is activated all year round. Only those who possess the Zhuge Bloodline will be able to pass through it. Does Master Yin Ren know a way to bypass it?” Daoist Niantian asked.

“I’m afraid not. However, I had a duel with the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief a while back, and I was fortunate to win the duel. As a reward, I’ll be allowed to bring a junior into the Zhuge Clan’s legacy formation once.

“I was thinking of bringing a disciple of my liking there in the future, but it’s a pity that I haven’t been able to find anyone who catches my eye thus far. I don’t want this opportunity to go to waste.&nbsp;

“Even though I was only obeying the orders of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief when I extracted Princess Miaomiao’s soul from her body, there’s no denying that I have caused her harm. I am deeply ashamed of my actions. Since young friend Chu Feng is intending to save Princess Miaomiao, I’m willing to present this opportunity to you.

“That being said, whether you’ll be able to benefit from the legacy formation or not depends on your own capabilities. The Zhuge Clan might have fallen into decline in recent years, but they are still the most powerful world spiritist clan in our Nine Souls Galaxy. Their talents are not to be looked down on.&nbsp;

“Yet, none of those talents have been able to clear the legacy formation. Even the renowned Zhuge Feiluan has challenged the legacy formation multiple times to date but to no avail,” Master Yin Ren said.

“Zhuge Feiluan?”

Chu Feng had heard this name before.

It was said that there were two talented junior world spiritists in the Nine Souls Galaxy. One was the Gongsun Clan’s Gongsun Yuntian and the other was the Zhuge Clan’s Zhuge Feiluan.

Chu Feng had crossed hands with Gongsun Yuntian once back at the Graveyard Realm. He was able to emerge victorious in the end, but if they had competed strictly on the grounds of spirit power, he would have likely lost to the latter.&nbsp;

It was likely that Zhuge Feiluan was on the same level as Gongsun Yuntian at the very minimum, perhaps even surpassing the latter.

“Chu Feng, what do you think?” Daoist Niantian asked.

“Elders, would you be willing to accompany me to the Zhuge Clan?”&nbsp;

Chu Feng looked at Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Buyu, and Shengguang Baimei.

Those three had been a great help to him, but they weren’t Chu Feng’s subordinates. Rather, they were powerhouses in their own rights, and they were bound to have many matters to deal with. He couldn’t expect them to follow him all around like bodyguards.

“Young hero Chu Feng, there’s no need to be so courteous. We’re here to ensure your safety. Since we have come here together, it’s only right for us to return together as well,” Shengguang Baimei said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, we share the same thoughts as Lord Baimei,” Shengguang Buyu said.

“Thank you for your help, elders. I’ll remember this debt.”

Chu Feng clasped his fist out of gratitude. He felt a surge of warmth into his heart.&nbsp;

He was still weak and needed their help right now. He had previously thought that they were helping him just to fawn on him, but those thoughts had already been vanquished from his mind by this point.

The group of them began making their way to the Zhuge Clan.&nbsp;

The Nine Souls Galaxy was massive, and they had to traverse across multiple starfields in order to reach the Zhuge Clan. Even if they utilized some of the ancient teleportation formations, they would still have to travel for quite some distance.&nbsp;

Fortunately, Daoist Niantian had a treasure shaped like a silver boat that allowed them to travel at hastened speed in the ancient teleportation formation, thus shortening the length of their journey.&nbsp;

Chu Feng didn’t want to waste his time along the way, so he constructed a spirit formation world and entered it to cultivate.&nbsp;

He couldn’t rely on his Heavenly Lightning Nine Levels Slash anymore, so he had to find other means to strengthen himself. It just so happened that he had obtained powerful Exalted Taboos from the Holy Valley not too long ago.

Chu Feng had a high intelligence that allowed him to master any martial skills with ease, especially after he acquired the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip. If it was a simpler martial skill, he could even grasp them with a mere glance. There were very few cultivators who could match him on that aspect.&nbsp;

However, those manuals he had obtained from the Holy Valley were high-ranked Exalted Taboos. Even he would require some time to fully comprehend them. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

While Chu Feng was working hard, the others weren’t slacking off either.&nbsp;

Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Baimei, and Shengguang Buyu made use of this time to cultivate in their own ways too. Of course, in order to prevent Princess Xiaoxiao and Master Yin Ren from getting away, Shengguang Baimei had sealed off the area around the silver boat with his oppressive might.&nbsp;

Master Yin Ren sat with closed eyes, and it was hard to tell whether he was cultivating or not. As for Princess Xiaoxiao, she stared at the spirit space swiftly passing them by with a pensive look on her face. It was hard to tell what she was thinking.

All of a sudden, she heard a voice transmission.

“Princess, surely you can’t be intending to let Chu Feng extract Princess Miaomiao from your body? That’ll worsen your affliction. Your days will be numbered. If you’re just going along with them out of fear, there’s no need for that. I have ways to escape from them.”

It was from Master Yin Ren.

Princess Xiaoxiao turned to look at Master Yin Ren, only to see that the latter’s eyes were closed. However, she was certain that he was the one who had just spoken to her.

It was with his powerful spirit power that Master Yin Ren was able to gain great support from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. It would be no exaggeration to call him the strongest world spiritist of the Nine Souls Galaxy.&nbsp;

As such, Princess Xiaoxiao didn’t doubt his words at all.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, I’ll point out a path for you. As long as you follow the path, they won’t be able to find you,” Master Yin Ren said.

The next moment, Princess Xiaoxiao felt inexplicable guidance leading her in a certain direction. As a world spiritist herself, she could easily follow the guidance and make a getaway.

“Master Yin Ren, would Miaomiao really be able to recover once she’s extracted from my body?” Princess Xiaoxiao asked.&nbsp;

“If Chu Feng is able to reach rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation, it won’t be too difficult to bring Princess Miaomiao back to life. However, that’s assuming that he’s able to clear the legacy formation. His chances of success are slim at best, so I don’t think you should bear too much hope for this.&nbsp;

“Besides, you should have already seen that white-browed old man’s attitude. If Chu Feng is unable to reach rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation, there’s no way they would let us off,” Master Yin Ren replied.

Princess Xiaoxiao hesitated upon hearing those words, but after careful consideration, she still shook her head and replied, “I don’t wish to betray Chu Feng.”

“Princess Xiaoxiao, he won’t necessarily reciprocate your feelings. Nevertheless, I’ll heed your will,” Master Yin Ren replied with a sigh.

Princess Xiaoxiao turned to look at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng’s body was completely hidden behind a formation, but even looking at the formation he constructed was enough to fill her usually cold eyes with tenderness.&nbsp;
