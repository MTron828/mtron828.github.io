Chapter 4474: Just Try Touching Me

“Should I take it that you have come here intentionally to go against our Zhao Clan, or are you aiming for the spirit beast?” Zhao Yuzhuo glanced at the spirit beast in Chu Feng’s hand as he spoke with a frosty tone.

“I don’t want to waste my words on you. Let her go, and I’ll give you this spirit beast,” Chu Feng said.

“Let the spirit beast go, and we’ll return her,” Zhao Yuzhuo replied.

“Don’t try to negotiate with me. I have no intentions of talking terms with you,” Chu Feng said as he tightened his grip around the spirit beast, causing it to squeak even more desperately.

“You bastard! Who do you think you are to threaten the two of us? You must be tired of living!”

Seeing how arrogant Chu Feng was acting, Zhao Batian finally lost his patience and roared at Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng didn’t even bother responding to Zhao Batian’s furious roar. He simply nonchalantly tightened his grip further, causing the spirit beast to struggle more and more violently.

“Big brother, let that lass go.”

Seeing that the current situation wasn’t to their advantage, Zhao Yuzhuo finally gave in with a frown.

Zhao Yuzhuo’s willingness to compromise surprised the crowd. Those who had heard of him knew him to be a domineering and unreasonable individual. He had always been the one to threaten others, and never had anyone dared to turn the tables on him before.

Such a haughty person was being threatened at the moment, and he actually chose to give in?

But in truth, Zhao Yuzhuo was simply weighing the pros and cons in his mind. The reason why he wanted to capture the spirit beast so much was because the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan fancied it. This humiliation was a small price to pay if he could please the princess in return.

“Scram, you nasty lass!”

Even though Zhao Batian was unhappy at the current turn of events, he didn’t dare to go against Zhao Yuzhuo. Thus, he reluctantly released Long Xiaoxiao from his grasp.

As soon as Long Xiaoxiao regained her freedom, she obediently headed over to Chu Feng’s side instead of settling the score with Zhao Batian.

“Little benefactor, I’m sorry. I...”

Long Xiaoxiao took a glance at Chu Feng before her head drooped down in guilt. She felt deeply ashamed of herself.

Just as Chu Feng had guessed, she continued to linger inside the barrier after Chu Feng had left, which resulted in Zhao Batian noticing her. If only she had chosen to heed Chu Feng’s instruction, she wouldn’t have gotten into this mess.

“It’s fine as long as you have learned your lesson. Are you alright? Are you injured anywhere?” Chu Feng looked at Long Xiaoxiao concernedly.

Sensing Chu Feng’s warm gaze, Long Xiaoxiao couldn’t hold her emotions back anymore, and tears began pattering from her eyes.

She didn’t respond to Chu Feng’s question because she knew that she couldn’t conceal her crying if she were to speak, and she didn’t want to bother Chu Feng any more than this. So, she shook her head to indicate that she was fine.

“It’s good that you’re fine. Leave the rest to me,” Chu Feng said as he fondled Long Xiaoxiao’s head dotingly.

“So she’s your lover? It’s no wonder why you dare to stand against us to save her!” Zhao Batian sneered coldly.

“It’s time for you to fulfill your promise!” Zhao Yuzhuo urged as he looked at the spirit beast in Chu Feng’s hand.

Take it!”

With a flick of his wrist, Chu Feng tossed the spirit beast over to Zhao Yuzhuo.

Even though it looked like Chu Feng had been torturing the spirit beast earlier by gripping its vitals, in truth, it was all a facade he had created using his spirit power.

The spirit beast was still prancing around exuberantly, completely free of harm.

After verifying that nothing was wrong with the spirit beast, Zhao Yuzhuo nodded his head in satisfaction. Then, he turned to look at Chu Feng with fury burning in his eyes.

“Big brother!” Zhao Yuzhuo ordered Zhao Batian.

Boom!

In the next moment, the oppressive might of a rank seven Utmost Exalted level cultivator shrouded the sky, sealing off the area around Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao to prevent them from escaping.

It was from Zhao Batian!

It didn’t just stop at that. Like a ferocious beast, the oppressive might collapsed inward onto Chu Feng without any hesitation to claim his life.

“This is...”

But the sight that followed caused everyone to stagger backward in shock. Even Zhao Batian and Zhao Yuzhuo were forced to look at Chu Feng in new light.

A Divine-level Lightning Mark had appeared on Chu Feng’s forehead, and a Lightning Armor had formed around his body too.

Chu Feng’s original cultivation was at rank five Utmost Exalted level, but as he exerted his means, his cultivation rose instantaneously to rank seven Utmost Exalted level.

With this enhanced strength, he fended off Zhao Batian’s oppressive might with ease.

One must know cultivators that had managed to grasp the Divine-level Lightning Mark was already extremely rare in the world, but Chu Feng was actually able to use the Lightning Armor on top of that.

The power of the Lightning Armor should have never appeared on a cultivator that was of Chu Feng’s level.

“It’s no wonder why you’re so arrogant. It seems like you still have some capabilities. Which Heavenly Clan are you from?” Zhao Yuzhuo asked Chu Feng.

“Where I came from has nothing to do with you. I’d just like to give you a word of advice here. I’m in a very terrible mood at the moment, so don’t block my way. Otherwise, don’t expect me to have mercy on you!” Chu Feng growled at Zhao Yuzhuo and Zhao Batian.

“Mercy on us? Hahaha! If anyone is going to lose their life here, it would be you and that lover of yours!”

Boom!

With a furious roar, blue flames sprouted from Zhao Batian’s body. The blue flames fused together with the clouds and covered the entire skyline.

This was a Divine Power.

Through the prowess of the Divine Power, Zhao Batian’s cultivation rose a rank up to rank eight Utmost Exalted level.

“Lad, what are you going to do now? Are you going to have your woman fight with me once more?” Zhao Batian asked Chu Feng smugly.

He had crossed hands with Long Xiaoxiao earlier, so he knew how powerful she was. Even though he had won the battle in the end, he knew that she wasn’t an opponent whom he could afford to underestimate. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As for Chu Feng, while his means were indeed impressive, his base cultivation was only at rank five Utmost Exalted level. With that, Zhao Batian knew that as long as he were to raise his cultivation up to rank eight Utmost Exalted level, Chu Feng wouldn’t stand a chance against him at all.

In other words, the only one who could pose a threat to him here as Long Xiaoxiao. That being said, since he was able to defeat Long Xiaoxiao once earlier, he was confident that he could do it again.

Everything was within his control.

“Your enemy is me!” Chu Feng replied coldly.

“Little benefactor, you mustn’t get careless against him. He possesses mysterious means!” Long Xiaoxiao sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng to warn him.

“Don’t worry,” Chu Feng told Long Xiaoxiao as he patted her head.

“You want to fight with me? Do you think that you’re worthy of being my opponent?” Zhao Batian asked with a voice filled with sarcasm.

“You’re just a mere rank five Utmost Exalted level cultivator! Even after raising your cultivation, you’re still only at rank seven Utmost Exalted level. Do you think that someone of your caliber would stand a chance against me?”

It wasn’t just Zhao Batian here who looked down on Chu Feng. All those who were unfamiliar with Chu Feng’s means were all looking at him in skepticism.

There was no way a rank seven Utmost Exalted level cultivator could stand a chance against a rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivator. The crowd wanted to know just what in the world was giving this young man the confidence to dare to challenge Zhao Batian to a fight.

But faced with everyone’s doubt, Chu Feng simply chuckled softly and said, “You’re asking me whether I stand a chance against you? Hah! I should be the one asking you that question instead! Someone of your strength wouldn’t even be able to touch a single strand of my hair!”
