Chapter 3788 - Watermirror Paradise

The attendant was carried away by the other workers of the teahouse. Luo Zhi took his seat again.

The others all stepped forward and began to urge Luo Zhi to not be angry.

From time to time, Luo Zhi would glance at Chu Feng.

As matters stood, he knew that none of this was the attendant’s fault. Instead, it was all due to Chu Feng.

Luo Zhi did not bother to think about how Chu Feng had managed to accomplish it. He merely knew that Chu Feng was the person who had screwed him over and made him humiliate himself in such a manner before all those people.

Thus, he was looking at Chu Feng with killing intent in his eyes.

As for Chu Feng, he completely disregarded Luo Zhi’s killing-intent-filled gaze.

In his eyes, Luo Zhi was despicable and shameless, someone who had committed all sorts of evil.

Of course, as there were too many evil people in the world, he had no intention to take care of all of them.

Thus, for people like Luo Zhi, if their evildoings were not encountered by him, Chu Feng would not have bothered to pay any attention to them.

However, if they dared to direct their evildoings at him, he would have them know what was meant by ’there’s no pill for regret’.

“What’s going on?”

“Young master Luo, what happened earlier?”

Not long afterward, a very fat middle-aged man walked in.

That man wore gorgeous clothes, and was completely bedecked in jewelry. He looked exactly like a wealthy local landlord.

Hearing the conversation, Chu Feng learned that the fat middle-aged man was actually the manager of the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse.

Seeing the middle-aged fatty, and then seeing the somewhat stylish teahouse, Chu Feng suddenly realized that the design of the teahouse was most likely unrelated to the fat manager. Chu Feng felt that the fat manager would not have the aesthetic taste to create such a design. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Senior, that attendant of yours actually poisoned us with poisoned tea. You must uphold justice for us in this matter.”

Seeing the manager, the previously arrogant Luo Zhi grew much gentler.

He was nothing more than a person who feared the strong and bullied the weak.

He had bullied the attendant, and shouted about smashing the teahouse to the attendant.

However, when faced with the Martial Immortal-level manager, he immediately addressed him as ‘senior’ and spoke very respectfully.

“You don’t have to worry about this matter. I will definitely provide a proper explanation for you.”

“That said, is that Peace Gauze Monastery’s elder with you all?” asked the manager.

“Who?” asked Luo Zhi.

“That woman who’s very tall and thin, with very light skin and a black ponytail,” said the teahouse’s manager.

“That would be Li Chuchu. Now that you mention it, where’s Li Chuchu?” Luo Zhi turned his gaze to the crowd present.

“You were stinking too much earlier, and Li Chuchu is obsessed with cleanliness. Thus, she ran out," said someone.

“Oh, then it would be her. What’s wrong, senior? Did she get into some sort of trouble?” asked Luo Zhi.

“She didn’t cause any trouble. However, I’ve heard from an attendant that she was captured and brought into a private room by some people. Furthermore, it seemed like she was rather unwilling to enter the room. That’s why I came over to ask you all about it,” said the manager.

“What?! Someone dared to mess with my friend?! They’re simply courting death!”

Luo Zhi and the others were immediately enraged upon hearing those words. They asked, “Senior, which private room is it?”

“Men, lead the way for young master Luo,” said the manager.

Soon, an attendant arrived and began to lead the way for Luo Zhi and the others.

Furiously, Luo Zhi and the others followed the attendant to the private room.

However, no one noticed that the manager revealed a cold smile on his face after Luo Zhi and the others had left.

Seeing that cold smile, Chu Feng knew that the manager had done this on purpose.

Likely, the manager harbored ill feelings for Luo Zhi after he beat up that attendant earlier.

That was why he had deliberately set them up. If Chu Feng guessed correctly, the people in the other private room were most definitely people that Luo Zhi and his friends could not afford to offend.

“Asura, let us go and have a look too," Song Ge said to Chu Feng with a quiet voice.

“You don’t seem like someone fond of watching a show,” said Chu Feng.

“I’m not going to watch a show. It’s just that Li Chuchu is someone that I know too.”

“She’s a woman, and has been captured by a bunch of people and been taken into a private room. I do not know what might happen to her. That’s why I’m worried about her," said Song Ge.

“Very well. Then let us follow them too,” as Chu Feng spoke, he began to lead Song Ge.

Luo Zhi and the others had arrived before the entrance of that private room angrily.

“Bang!” Luo Zhi smashed through the entrance door with a kick.

“Motherfuckers! Which eyeless bastard dared touch the friend of this Luo Zhi?!”

“Today, I shall break all of your legs!!!”

Luo Zhi cursed out angrily after smashing through the gate. As he cursed, he brought his men and rushed inside.

The lackeys behind Luo Zhi rushed into the door with confidence and impressive demeanors.

However, upon rushing inside, the fierceness on their faces disappeared. They all stood there as if they were petrified.

Replacing the fierceness that was previously present on their face was endless panic and fear.

“Crap! It’s trouble! Song Ge, we must leave immediately!”

Chu Feng noticed that Wang Lian was pulling Song Ge away and urging her to quickly leave through voice transmission.

At the same time, Chu Feng noticed the situation inside.

That private room was not only much larger than the one Luo Zhi and his friends had been in, but it was also much more meticulously decorated. Evidently, it was a higher quality private room.

Earlier, Luo Zhi had declared that the private room they were in was the highest quality one. Evidently, he had been boasting.

Of course, that wasn’t what was important. What was important was what could possibly bring such fear to Luo Zhi and the others.

Naturally, that would be the people.

Besides Luo Zhi and his friends, there were over a dozen people inside the private room.

They all wore the same type of outfit. Evidently, they belonged to the same power.

Speaking of it, it was quite a coincidence. Chu Feng recognized their outfit.

The reason for that was because the old man and young woman he had encountered in the vicinity of the Seven Suns Mountain Range had also worn that outfit.

Through the title plates on their waists, Chu Feng knew who those people were.

They were disciples from Watermirror Paradise.

Chu Feng was able to sense that the strongest among those Watermirror Paradise disciples were only rank one Heavenly Immortals.

Ignoring Song Ge, there were many in Luo Zhi’s group that possessed the cultivation of rank one Heavenly Immortal. As for Luo Zhi himself, his cultivation was that of a rank two Heavenly Immortal.

That said, Luo Zhi possessing his level of cultivation was actually very normal.

Although Luo Zhi lived a very carefree and loose life, he was actually over a thousand years old. Although he was trying to get Song Ge, he was actually as old as her mother.

That said, that was not what was important. What was important was that Luo Zhi, even though he clearly possessed the cultivation of a rank two Heavenly Immortal, was scared witless by a bunch of rank one Heavenly Immortals.

Evidently, he was not afraid of them because of their strength. Rather, it was because of their identity.

The identity of those people brought fear deep fear to Luo Zhi.

“Where did this bunch of shits come from?! You dared to kick through this young master’s door?!” said a man who seemed to be the leader of the group. His tone was very cold.

The woman by the name of Li Chuchu was currently being held by that man.

It could be seen that she wanted to resist him. Yet, she was both powerless and scared of resisting.
