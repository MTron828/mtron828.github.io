Chapter 5456: Nothing But Misery Awaits You

“Why should I tell you? Chu Feng, who do you think you are? So what if you have the Totem Dragon Clan’s backing? So what if you kill me today? The Golden Dragon Flame Sect has been destroyed. Even if your grandmother is still alive, I reckon that she’s living in agony. You had to struggle in desperation up to this day in order to complete your vengeance, whereas I enjoyed all of the luxuries I could. It has been a fruitful life for me! Hahahahaha…”

Jia Lingyi laughed arrogantly.

Even the onlookers gritted their teeth from how hateful she was, but Chu Feng remained calm as if what she had said had nothing to do with him at all.

“It’s rare to see a junior with Chu Feng’s level of maturity.”

Long Suqing looked at Chu Feng with eyes of admiration. She could tell that he was angry, but he had chosen to conceal his fury inside his heart. This was an important skill that even those from the older generation struggled with, let alone a junior.

“You’re running your mouth in hopes that I’d give you an easy death. Do you think that I’d let you have your way?”

Chu Feng channeled his spirit power to construct a formation. The formation was black in color, and the crowd could already sense that there was something extraordinary about it even before it had been completed.

Even the face of the arrogant Jia Lingyi started twitching. She seemed to know what Chu Feng was going to do next.

The formation was soon completed. A punishment stand appeared beneath Jia Lingyi.

Whoosh!

Black chains covered in spikes shot out and bound Jia Lingyi, causing her body to instantly become bloodied. Once she had been held in place, many torture tools and venomous worms rose from the formation.

Under Chu Feng’s command, those torture tools and venomous worms were hurtled toward Jia Lingyi. Even though his cultivation was far beneath Jia Lingyi’s, he was able to deal damage to her thanks to the monster suppressing her.

He had never been one to go easy on others, especially not his enemies. In just a few moments, Jia Lingyi had already begun screaming her head off.

“I would have never known that Chu Feng was capable of something like that despite his young age.”

Even Long Suqing and the others felt placated seeing the torture Jia Lingyi was put under.

Yet, even though Jia Lingyi was put through so much agony that she hardly had the strength to scream anymore, she still refused to confess the identity of the woman. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Who could have thought that woman is so loyal? She’s still remaining tight-lipped even now!” Eggy spat.

“It’s not loyalty that’s driving her. People like her value themselves more than anything else in the world. She knows that she’s already dead meat. Even if I spare her, the Totem Dragon Clan would never let her off. She just wants to disgust me by concealing the identity of that woman to the very end,” Chu Feng said.

“Is that so? How repulsive. Chu Feng, let me out,” Eggy said.

She wanted to personally torture Jia Lingyi.

“She’s already at her limit. She’ll be dead if you make a move too,” Chu Feng said.

“Let her die then. Aren’t you planning to kill her?” Eggy asked.

“No, I’ve changed my mind. Since she isn’t afraid of death, I’ll let her live.”

“You’ll let her live?”

“I’ll be letting her off too easily by killing her like that. I want her to live a life worse than death,” Chu Feng said.

With a wave of his sleeves, he dispelled the formation around Jia Lingyi.

The crowd was impressed by Jia Lingyi’s tight lips. They had thought that someone who had lived a privileged life like her would quickly succumb to Chu Feng’s torture, but she actually held on till now, refusing to even beg for mercy.

It didn’t seem likely that Chu Feng could make her submit anymore.

Just as everyone thought that Chu Feng was going to kill Jia Lingyi and end things here, he suddenly said, “I know that you want to die, Jia Lingyi. I won’t let you have your wish. You said that you have enjoyed all kinds of luxuries thus far, and that it has been a fruitful life for you? I’ll show you a life devoid of any semblance of happiness from this point onward. Nothing but misery awaits you.”

Chu Feng pointed his finger at Jia Lingyi, and the monster stepped forward and pierced her body with its sharp claws. Jia Lingyi screamed in agony as her cultivation and origin energies slipped away from her. All she was left with was barely enough to sustain her.

At the same time, Jia Lingyi’s appearance started to change. Despite her wretched state, the crowd could see that her bones and flesh were reforming to become uglier. Everything that she was proud of was being taken away from her.

Now that the Totem Dragon Clan had gotten involved, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect couldn’t protect her anymore. If anything, they would be praying hard not to get implicated by this. Even if she survived this ordeal, she could only live in misery for the rest of her life.

“Are you fine with this?” Chu Feng asked Long Muxi, Long Chengyu, and the others.

“We’ll follow you,” Long Chengyu said.

Long Kuitian and Long Suqing didn’t say a word, but Long Chengyu’s words held enough weight.

“Let her live then.”

Chu Feng waved his sleeves, and a powerful suction force took away all of the origin energies and treasures of those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Following that, he waved at the monster, and the latter transformed into a wisp of black aura that dove into his palm.

The crowd was taken aback.

They hadn’t thought that Chu Feng could control that terrifying monster to this extent. Their impression of him was elevated to exalted heights. This transcended the boundaries of what could be considered the feat of a prodigious junior.

Those who previously failed to understand why the Totem Nine Daoists, Long Muxi, and Long Chengyu were willing to stand up for Chu Feng finally understood why those people did what they did.

Chu Feng was simply worthy of their favors!
