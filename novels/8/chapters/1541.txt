MGA: Chapter 1542 - Battle Between Martial Emperors

“Those who dare to intrude into our Cursed Soil Sect shall die!!!”

Suddenly, an ear-piercing voice sounded from that person’s mouth.

That voice was extremely loud and clear, and actually managed to resound through the entire Cursed Soil Sect. Even Chu Feng and the others were able to hear this voice, which was clearly filled with killing intent and anger.

“This voice, it’s a Martial Emperor, it’s the Fiend Emperor. What’s going on, how did he manage to discover us?”

After hearing that voice, Dugu Xingfeng and the others became uneasy. They were all able to sense how tyrannical the might contained in that angry shout was. It had already surpassed the Half Martial Emperor level. The source of that voice was clearly a Martial Emperor-level expert.

“Dugu Xingfeng, did you really think that you would be able to trap us here by putting up a spirit formation? If you did, you’d really be underestimating me, Sang Kun, too enormously.”

“I might as well tell you the truth. Through using a certain secret paper talisman technique, I created a clone. That clone of mine possesses only a single purpose. That is, when I am in danger, I can control my clone to have it signal for help.”

“While your world spirit techniques might be able to trap me, you will not be able to trap my thoughts. I have already used my clone and gone to request help from Lord Fiend Emperor.”

“As for you all, you can wait for death here,” The Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster spoke with great pride.

Hearing that explanation, Dugu Xingfeng and the others all came to understand what had happened. It turned out that the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster Sang Kun already had a backup plan, and he actually hid a clone somewhere else in the Cursed Soil Sect.

It was no wonder that the Fiend Emperor would discover them even after they had already trapped Sang Kun and the others and prevented them from sending a signal for help.

“Are you certain that the ones who’ll die are us?”

However, even with this being the case, Dugu Xingfeng and the others were still not afraid. That was because it was not only the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster who possessed a backup plan, they too possessed a backup plan.

“Rumble, rumble~~~”

At this moment, the sky outside of the Cursed Soil Sect’s forbidden area was trembling violently. Even the surrounding space was being distorted. As emperor-level martial power wreaked havoc through the region, everything in the world seemed to have to bow before it.

That stream of emperor-level martial power was being emitted by an old man wearing a black gown. That old man possessed a pair of dark green eyes. Furthermore, his face was covered with runes and symbols. His appearance was very frightening, and at a glance, he looked like a demon, a very sinister and frightening demon, in a human’s body.

When this person appeared, all of the elders and disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect immediately kneeled onto the ground and began to bow in salute. They did not even dare to raise their heads. It was as if they were ordinary commoners worshipping a god.

Even though they already knew that it was very likely that someone had intruded into their Cursed Soil Sect, none of them bothered to find the intruder.

That was because the appearance of this individual signified that they did not have to worry about anything. This person before them was a Martial Emperor, a powerful existence akin to a god in their hearts. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

With the appearance of this person, regardless of who it was who had intruded into their Cursed Soil Sect, there would only be a single end for them -- death.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Suddenly, an item flew over from the distance with an extremely rapid speed.

The appearance of that item caused all of heaven and earth to tremble violently. Practically everyone in the entire Cursed Soil Sect was able to experience how powerful that item was. Even though they could not see it, they were able to sense that there was an exceptionally powerful oppressive might crushing down from the sky.

“Wuuwaa~~~”

“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”

After that item appeared, many of the Cursed Soil Sect’s disciples became unable to resist its oppressive might and started to vomit blood. As for those with weak levels of cultivation, they even exploded on the spot.

“Paa~~~”

However, the Fiend Emperor did not try to dodge the item that was rapidly flying to attack him. Instead, he extended his palm and grabbed that item.

After that item entered his hand, all of the might and force that it was displaying disappeared. When the Fiend Emperor opened his hand, he discovered that what was in his hand was actually a very ordinary little rock.

A little rock was able to carry such might, and bring about such devastation. This meant that it was not that this little rock was that powerful. Rather, it was the person who had thrown it who was powerful.

“Since you’ve come, why not show yourself?” The Fiend Emperor turned to the direction from which the little rock had been thrown from and asked with a sinister tone.

“Hahaha...” An aged laugh sounded. Then, a figure appeared in the sky. Merely, this figure was covered in a layer of golden light. With that golden light surrounding him, it was impossible to see who that person was. In fact, one could not even tell if that person was a human or not.

“Since you’ve come, why not show your true form? Without even this bit of courage, you actually dare to stir up trouble in our Cursed Soil Sect?” The Fiend Emperor asked coldly.

“Hahaha...” The golden figure did not answer the Fiend Emperor. Instead, he laughed once again. While that laughter was filled with mockery, it had been altered.

That was because this golden figure was the Yan Clan’s Ancestor. He could not expose himself. Thus, he could only act in such a manner. In fact, all he had to do was hinder the Fiend Emperor and allow Dugu Xingfeng and the others to quickly finish their rescue.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, the Fiend Emperor’s body shifted. He turned into a black ray and flew toward the forbidden area with rapid speed. He was truly too fast, so fast that ordinary people would not be able to see his silhouette at all.

“Woosh~~~”

At the moment when the Fiend Emperor moved, the Yan Clan’s Ancestor also moved. He followed closely behind the Fiend Emperor and started to unleash attacks toward him.

His attack was a palm strike. Although the palm strike appeared to be a normal palm strike, it contained absolutely threatening power. Even the Fiend Emperor would not dare to ignore it.

The Fiend Emperor did not dodge the incoming palm strike. Rather, he waved his sleeve and brought forth a frantic whirlwind that dissolved the power of the incoming palm strike.

“You’re planning to hinder me?” It turned out that the Fiend Emperor was testing what the purpose of this unknown guest was. His test was a success. He had managed to determine that the purpose of this person was to stall him.

“Hahahaha......” Like before, the Yan Clan’s Ancestor only laughed and did not say anything. While the Fiend Emperor didn’t move, he too would not do anything.

“You wish to stop me? That will depend on whether or not you have the skills to do so,” The Fiend Emperor did not bother with superfluous words. He suddenly flipped his palm, took out a paper talisman and shot it toward the Yan Clan’s Ancestor.

The Yan Clan’s Ancestor was already prepared. He opened his palm and rapidly streaked it across the air. As his palm tore through the air again and again, countless palm strikes formed of emperor-level martial power appeared. One after another, they all shot toward the paper talisman cast by the Fiend Emperor.

“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”

In an instant, the sky and earth began to shake and tremble. Energy ripples began to wreak havoc. These energy ripples were no ordinary energy ripples. No one in the entire Cursed Soil Sect was capable of withstanding those energy ripples. As for the Yan Clan’s Ancestor, he also did not allow the Fiend Emperor the opportunity to block those energy ripples for the Cursed Soil Sect’s members.

Thus, as the energy ripples wreaked havoc and spread, they left behind a frightening level of devastation. In merely an instant, heaven and earth had been overturned. All of the buildings underneath the two fighters were shaken into dust. As for those elders and disciples, they all exploded from the devastating might of the energy ripples. They were dead beyond dead.

Even at a radius of thousands of miles away from where the battle was, the energy ripples still caused the destruction of buildings. Crushed rocks and stones were swirling in the air, and countless elders and disciples began to vomit blood before falling to the ground.

This was the frightening power of Martial Emperors. Even though they did not have the intention to involve others, merely the aftermath of their attacks were capable of destroying all constructions and scenery, as well as slaughtering all living creatures within a range of thousands of miles.
