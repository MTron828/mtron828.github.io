Chapter 2872 - The Proud Zhao Kun

“Our Nine Profound Sect specializes in martial cultivation and abandons our study of world spirit techniques. As such, we’ve only managed to produce three Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists in the last hundred years. Brother Tuoba, please excuse our poor performance,” the Nine Profound Sect’s silver-haired old man sighed and smiled as he spoke.

“You’re flattering me. Our Starfall Holy Land has also only managed to produce three Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists the last hundred years as well,” Elder Tuoba said.

The two of them continued to compliment one another. Under these circumstances, Zhao Kuangfengyi was unable to stand by idly.

He seemed to be extremely anxious to have his grandson reveal his strength.

Thus, he said, “Brother Tuoba, may I know how much longer till the Inheritance Cave opens?”

“I’m afraid it will take another six hours,” Elder Tuoba replied.

“Six hours is a long time. Since we have nothing to do in the meantime, how about we have the people of the younger generation spar with one another?” Zhao Kuangfengyi said.

“That is a great suggestion. Brother Li, what do you think about it?” Elder Tuoba turned to ask the Nine Profound Sect’s silver-haired old man.

“That’s naturally not an issue. Merely, how are they going to spar?” The Nine Profound Sect’s silver-haired old man asked.

“Since the sparring would be in terms of world spirit techniques, it would naturally have to be one on one. Let’s make the sparring the simplest sort, a match between offensive and defensive spirit techniques.”

“One party will defend, and the other party will attack. After that, the two parties will switch sides. The first side to defeat one’s opponent’s spirit formation shall be the victor.”

“The time for setting up spirit formations should be an incense stick’s worth of time. What do you all think about it?” Zhao Kuangfengyi said.

“Very well, it’s decided then,” that Nine Profound Sect’s silver-haired old man accepted without hesitation.

At that moment, Asura Zhao Kun immediately stood forth. He was extremely confident. It was as if he were a ruler before ordinary people.

Although they were all Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, Asura Zhao Kun evidently did not place any of the five people from the Nine Profound Sect’s side in his eyes.

“Which among you will take me on first?” Asura Zhao Kun asked.

“I will,” the disciples from the Nine Profound Sect did not hesitate. Immediately, one of their disciples stood forth to confront Asura Zhao Kun.

“If it’s you, I will be able to defeat you with a single attack,” Asura Zhao Kun examined his opponent with contempt in his eyes.

Asura Zhao Kun was extremely arrogant. He was so arrogant that he did not even care about his opponent’s identity.

His opponent was someone from the Nine Profound Sect. As for the Nine Profound Sect, it was the overlord of the Nine Profound Upper Realm. In terms of strength, even the Starfall Holy Land would not be a match for them.

Thus, once Asura Zhao Kun said those words, not only was the Nine Profound Sect’s disciple that stood forth to confront him extremely displeased, but even the Nine Profound Sect’s elders were feeling extremely displeased.

“Little friend, you seem to be very confident. May I know who you are?” The Nine Profound Sect’s silver-haired old man asked.

“Oh, Brother Li, I’ve forgotten to introduce you. This person here is our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s renowned world spiritist, Zhao Kuangfengyi.”

“As for that little friend, he is Zhao Kuangfengyi’s grandson, Asura Zhao Kun,” Elder Tuoba introduced.

“Oh? He is that legendary Asura World Spiritist?”

Upon hearing the names ‘Zhao Kuangfengyi’ and ‘Asura Zhao Kun’, it was not only the disciples from the Nine Profound Realm, but even the elders revealed a change in their expressions.

It would appear that Asura World Spiritists truly possessed enormous reputations. Not only was Asura Zhao Kun known by the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he was known by even the people from the Nine Profound Upper Realm.

Perhaps because the reputation of Asura World Spiritists was simply too enormous, but that Nine Profound Sect’s disciple that was originally furious after being berated by Asura Zhao Kun actually revealed an expression of fear upon learning that the person before him was that legendary Asura World Spiritist.

He looked over to the two women wearing multi-colored skirts repeatedly. However, those two women completely ignored him. Because of this, that Nine Profound Sect’s disciple ended up being trapped in a dilemma with no way out.

At that moment, Asura Zhao Kun was even more pleased with himself.

Not only was he extremely pleased, but even his grandfather Zhao Kuangfengyi had a pleased expression on his face.

In fact, that Elder Tuoba even deliberately took a glance at Chu Feng, Elder Xingyi and Xia Yun’er.

His gaze seemed to be saying, ‘Did you all see that? The person I’ve invited was able to cow his opponent without even doing anything. Look at the person you’ve brought. What is that?’

Faced with that sort of gaze, Elder Xingyi could only force a smile. As for Xia Yun’er, she was slightly angry.

As for Chu Feng, he was still extremely calm. He was in no rush to act. As the saying goes, know yourself, know your enemy, and you will emerge victorious in every battle. Chu Feng wanted to see exactly how strong Asura Zhao Kun was.

Thus, he decided to allow Asura Zhao Kun to fight first while he stood on the sidelines to observe.

“Brother Zhao, you are too powerful. If you are to act directly, I fear that I, your brother will not have the opportunity to reveal my abilities.”

“How about you relax first and allow me, your brother to reveal my abilities first?”

Right at that moment, a male disciple from the Starfall Holy Land walked out.

“If you are to lose, do not blame me,” Asura Zhao Kun said with contempt.

“It’s alright if I lose. After all, there’s still you, brother Zhao,” that man seemed to be very afraid of Asura Zhao Kun. He was smiling apologetically and not angry even though Asura Zhao Kun had mocked him.

This was the first time Chu Feng saw a disciple from the Starfall Holy Land acting so subservient toward another member of the younger generation.

This indirectly illustrated that that Asura Zhao Kun was someone who possessed a certain degree of status among the people of the younger generation.

“Now that you’ve mentioned it. Go on ahead then,” as Asura Zhao Kun spoke, he began to swagger back. In fact, he even took a deliberate glance at Chu Feng.

His gaze was filled with contempt. The contempt in his eyes was even stronger than when he was facing that Starfall Holy Land’s disciple.

“I am the Starfall Holy Land’s disciple Jiang Lezhi. it is my pleasure to spar with you”

“I am the Nine Profound Sect’s disciple Mu An. My pleasure to spar with you.”

The two of them greeted one another respectfully. Then, they immediately began to set up their spirit formations.

The two of them seemed to have a tacit understanding with one another, as the disciple from the Starfall Holy Land began to set up a slaughtering formation, whereas the disciple from the Nine Profound Sect began to set up a defensive formation.

When the time limit of an incense stick’s worth of time arrived, the two of them had both finished setting up their spirit formations.

The spirit formation that the Starfall Holy Land’s disciple had set up was an enormous golden dragon. However, Chu Feng felt that while it appeared impressive, it did not possess sufficient power.

As for the Nine Profound Sect’s disciple, he had set up a circular defensive formation that shielded him completely within it. It did not have an elegant appearance, and was extremely plain-looking. However, its defensive ability was extremely powerful.

“That Starfall Holy Land’s disciple will lose,” Chu Feng said.

“I think so too,” Her Lady Queen said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Roar~~~”

The dazzling enormous golden dragon started to roar as it moved to attack that spherical defensive formation.

“Boom~~~”

A loud explosion was heard. Golden energy ripples began to wreak havoc, filling the entire remnant.

However, the elders from the Starfall Holy Land were all frowning.

They were all able to clearly see that the Nine Profound Sect’s disciple’s defensive formation was completely unmoved from the attack of their own disciple. Only a few small cracks had appeared on that spheroid defensive formation.

Although they were both Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, the disparity between them was not small at all.
