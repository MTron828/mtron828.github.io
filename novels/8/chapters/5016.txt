Chapter 5016: Lord Mucheng

“You can make the choice on your own. I won’t force you to join the Netherworld Sect anymore. Still, I should remind you that the other members of the Netherworld Sect might have different thoughts from mine,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

“Elder, what kind of power is your Netherworld Sect?” Chu Feng asked.

He had asked this question many times along the way. He did hate the Netherworld Sect at the very start, thinking that it was an evil organization that resorted to all means to achieve its goals. He thought that its hands were tainted with the blood of countless innocent people.

However, he later realized that the Netherworld Sect wasn’t as evil as he thought. There was no denying that their act of implanting Netherworld Embryos into children was vile, but they rarely killed the innocent.

Other than that, the Netherworld Envoy had been taking an amicable attitude toward Chu Feng thus far. Shengguang Baimei had also insolently confronted the Netherworld Envoy at one point in time, but the latter didn’t punish him at all.

In fact, Chu Feng had also directly questioned the Netherworld Envoy during their first meeting, but the latter patiently explained the goals of their sect to him.

Similar situations also happened along the way.

In any case, the Netherworld Envoy did seem like quite a peculiar guy to Chu Feng. He wouldn’t go as far as to say that the Netherworld Envoy was a good person, but he didn’t think that the latter was the worst of villains either.

“Our Netherworld Sect serves to bring prosperity to the world. If you wish to probe into the secrets of our sect, I’ll advise you to stop there.”

That was the standard answer offered by the Netherworld Envoy each and every time, no matter what Chu Feng asked. He even tried asking if the Undying Starfield was taken away by the Netherworld Sect.

Before the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor completely lost his consciousness, he once told Chu Feng that his true heritage was located in the Undying Starfield’s Flowersea Ordinary Realm.

Back then, Chu Feng was still too weak to obtain the heritage. When he felt that he was finally strong enough, he attempted to make his way there, only to find that the entire Undying Starfield had vanished.

The series of clues afterward pointed the Netherworld Sect out as the culprit. Chu Feng thought that he could find out more about it by asking the Netherworld Envoy, but the latter simply answered with three words: I don’t know.

Even though the Netherworld Envoy chatted with Chu Feng like a friend, his lips were tightly sealed when it came to important matters. Thus far, he hadn’t even revealed a single clue about the Netherworld Sect.

….

While Chu Feng was rushing the way together with the Netherworld Envoy, the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber finally came to the end of their business hours.

They would be resting for an entire year after this before opening their shop once more at an unknown location. That was their unique business model.

In truth, there were many people who were curious to know what the waiters of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber did in their resting time.

At this very moment, the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber had departed from the cliffside, but it was still floating above the mountain range. All eight of its waiters had already taken off their clothes to don similar armor.

Their armor was covered in scales similar to their own, and the aura it emanated was also similar to that of their people. Without a doubt, the armor was created specifically for them.

No one else could bring out the full prowess of the armor other than them.

As the saying went, ‘clothes make the men’.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

These words were simply too fitting on the waiters of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber. Now that they were in armor, not a single person would think of them as mere waiters. Some might even be intimidated to the point where they dared not to speak up in their presence.

The presence of the eight waiters was simply too powerful. They felt like heavenly generals who naturally commanded an air of authority, making it hard to look them in the eye.

They were all extremely powerful cultivators.

Creak!

The tightly shut doors of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber finally opened, and a middle-aged woman with a curvaceous figure walked in. She had alluring fox eyes and an irresistible figure which she didn’t hesitate to flaunt.

It was hard for any man to turn a blind eye to her. Her presence demanded attention.

“Lord Mucheng, you’re back.”

The waiters of the shop revealed smiles, but their heads were all respectfully lowered. They hadn’t been so humble even when they dealt with the customers earlier.

“You have all worked hard. Our Dragon Breath Spring Chamber might be closed now, but something even more tiring awaits you,” Lord Mucheng said.

“Lord Mucheng, we have no qualms operating the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber, but asking us to passionately serve those beneath us is simply too taxing. It has only been a day, but I feel like many years have already passed me by!”

“Yeah! It’s so hard to tolerate it!”

The waiters chirped in agreement.

“I know that you have worked hard. Here is the gift I’ve prepared for you.”

Lord Mucheng tossed a Cosmos Sack to each of the eight waiters with a seductive smile. The waiters immediately opened the Cosmos Sack to take a look, and delighted smiles emerged on their lips.

“Thank you, Lord Mucheng!!!”

Lord Mucheng’s smile deepened upon seeing how happy the waiters were. However, she quickly noticed the completed True Dragon Chessboard.

“That is? How did the True Dragon Chessboard turn into such a state?”

Her voice was quivering as she said those words.

“Lord Mucheng, we forgot to tell you that someone has managed to decipher the True Dragon Chessboard,” one of the waiters stepped forward and answered.

“Someone deciphered it? Who? Where is he?”

Lord Mucheng’s body started to tremble as she said those words as if something huge was going to happen next.

“It’s a junior named Chu Feng, but he has already left the area,” a waiter replied.

“What? He has left the area? How could you let him go? Find him! Find him right now, or else I’ll hold you responsible!”

It was just a moment that Lord Mucheng was addressing them amicably, but her face had already warped in rage.

“W-we’ll go right now!”

The waiters of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber paled in fright. This was the first time they saw Lord Mucheng revealing such an infuriated look. In truth, they did feel a little indignant since no one had told them to retain the person who solved the True Dragon Chessboard.

However, they dared not argue against the infuriated Lord Mucheng.

“Wait a moment. Tell me what that young man looks like,” Lord Mucheng said.

The waiter quickly drew our Chu Feng and the Netherworld Envoy’s appearance for her.

“Lord Mucheng, the young man is Chu Feng, the one who deciphered the True Dragon Chessboard. The one wearing the veil is his companion,” the waiter replied.

“What are you waiting for? Hurry up and find them! Don’t bother coming back if you can’t find them!” Lord Mucheng roared furiously.

The waiters quickly rushed out to look for Chu Feng.

Shortly after the waiters left, Lord Mucheng took out a box that was filled with scaled worms.

“Take a good look at these portraits. No matter what it takes, I want you to capture these two people alive,” Lord Mucheng pointed to the portraits of Chu Feng and the Netherworld Envoy as she spoke.

“Jip jip jip!”

The worms in the boxes immediately answered her order.

Lord Mucheng then tossed the box outward, causing the worms to swiftly fly out of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber. These worms expanded as soon as they left the box, and they started morphing into beings with a human body and a dragon tail. They swiftly scattered in all directions.

They moved at incredible speeds, such that it only took the blink of an eye for them to disappear into the surroundings.

Meanwhile, Lord Mucheng sat down at the entrance of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber and stared in a daze. She took out a token from her robe.

The words, ‘Qing Clan’, were inscribed on the token.

The token didn’t appear to be a treasure, but Lord Mucheng looked at it with wistful eyes.

“Lord Xuantian, don’t worry. The person who possesses the Heaven’s Eye has appeared in the world. I, Long Mucheng, will surely find him for you,” Lord Mucheng said.
