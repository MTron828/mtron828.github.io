Chapter 4539: Love Rival

“There’s no need to worry about that. There’s still the upcoming tournament, remember? It’ll be far more exciting to see Chu Feng facing up against the strongest juniors in the Holy Light Galaxy,” said Long Ning.

“Yes, you’re right. Given Chu Feng’s current prowess, he would surely be able to make a name for himself through this tournament. Looks like it won’t be long before the name ‘Chu Feng’ is known throughout the entire Holy Light Galaxy!

“While I knew that he would eventually achieve great things in the future, I must say that I didn’t expect him to accomplish so much within such a short span of time. The last time I saw him, he was still fighting against the juniors in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but in the blink of an eye, he had already risen to the top of the Holy Light Galaxy.”

Master Long Xuan remarked deeply.

He could still remember the sight of Chu Feng vying for a position amongst the Ancestral Martial Decastars back in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

Back then, Chu Feng was still struggling to match Linghu Hongfei in a direct battle. Had it not been for Chu Feng’s world spirit intervening in the battle, he could have very well lost the battle.

But now that he was looking at Chu Feng once more, he was no longer the same person he was from before. Putting aside Linghu Hongfei, there were probably not many juniors in the entire Holy Light Galaxy who could stand against Chu Feng!

The rate at which Chu Feng was growing had far surpassed Master Long Xuan’s expectations.

“It’s no wonder why this lad refused to become my disciple. I was indeed unworthy of it,” muttered Master Long Xuan with a voice so soft that only he could hear.

“Young hero Chu Feng is truly a man destined for greatness. Even his father and grandfather are no match for him. Long Ning, I believe that young hero Chu Feng is still quite fond of you. You must make sure to grasp his opportunity well. If young hero Chu Feng could really become our son-in-law, that would truly be...”

An elder from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City told Long Ning.

Long Ning didn’t respond to those words, but her face still turned a little red.

Women tended to fancy competent men, and Chu Feng was the cream of the crop.

Furthermore, he was also the one who had helped them return to the Dragon Clan, such that it was no exaggeration to say that he was the benefactor of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

It would be a lie if Long Ning said that she had no feelings for Chu Feng.

“Don’t talk nonsense.”

Yet, who could have thought that Long Daozhi would immediately berate the elder who said those words.

“Can’t you tell that Princess Xiaoxiao fancies young friend Chu Feng too?” Long Daozhi added.

And those words were like a thorn stabbing into Long Ning’s heart.

That’s right. She might have been compatible for Chu Feng back then, but things were no longer the same as before.

Even if Chu Feng didn’t scorn her, she didn’t have the courage to fight with Long Xiaoxiao for Chu Feng. It was no longer possible for her and Chu Feng to get together anymore.

With such thoughts in mind, Long Ning’s face drooped down in disappointment.

...

Meanwhile, Long Xiaoxiao had pulled Chu Feng onto another war chariot. There was no one else on this war chariot as it was Long Xiaoxiao’s personal vehicle.

“What’s wrong, Xiaoxiao?” asked Chu Feng.

“I have a question for you. Are you in love with that Long Ning?”

As Long Xiaoxiao asked that question, her eyes were completely focused on Chu Feng, almost as if she was trying to discern if he was lying.

“I don’t. Long Ning is a friend to me, just like Kong Tianhui,” replied Chu Feng.

“What about Xian Yun then?”

“She’s a friend too.”

“T-then... Kong Ci?”

“They are all friends."

“Alright. I have no more questions.”

A satisfied smile suddenly blossomed on Long Xiaoxiao’s face.

“Say, Your Highness, did you really pull me here just to ask me these questions?” asked Chu Feng.

“Hey! What do you mean by ‘these questions’? These aren’t minor issues. I have to verify whether they are my love rivals or not!” exclaimed Long Xiaoxiao indignantly.

“Love rivals? What are you talking about?” asked Chu Feng.

“Are you really refuting that? Haven’t you noticed how the three of them look at you? It’s obvious that they have feelings for you!” Long Xiaoxiao insisted.

“Even so, they aren’t love rivals. They are my friends,” said Chu Feng.

“I...” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Long Xiaoxiao still wanted to argue on this matter, but she was unable to find the words to convey her emotions.

And in the next moment, her face suddenly turned gloomy, looking almost like a deflated ball. The atmosphere grew heavy along with her mood.

Looking at the usually lively Long Xiaoxiao suddenly turning like that made Chu Feng’s heart ache a little. He wanted to say something to console her, but after some thought, he decided against it.

Chu Feng admitted that he was not a loyal person, or else he wouldn’t have fallen in love with Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei together. However, he had no intention of becoming a philanderer either. He wouldn’t get close to any woman just because she was outstanding or beautiful.

He did have a good impression of Long Xiaoxiao, but he had always regarded her as a good friend. He was aware that he didn’t carry any romantic feelings for her.

He could tell that Long Xiaoxiao fancied him, and that really put him in a spot. He didn’t want to hurt Long Xiaoxiao, but at the same time, he didn’t want to deceive her either. If he forced himself to be with her, it would only be unfair to the two of them.

“Alright, I’ve finished saying what I want to. I’ll be leaving now.”

Long Xiaoxiao broke the silence as he prepared to leave the area.

“Xiaoxiao, wait a moment,” Chu Feng suddenly called out.

“What? Are you going to emphasize that we’re friends now too?” Long Xiaoxiao replied grudgingly.

Her words made Chu Feng realize that he had hurt her through her insistence that they were friends earlier.

Sensing that Chu Feng was placed in an awkward position, Long Xiaoxiao, who was still indignant a moment ago, suddenly put out a smile and said, “Have you forgotten? We aren’t just ordinary friends. You’re my little benefactor too! So, what did you call me for?”

Long Xiaoxiao’s reaction only made Chu Feng’s heart hurt a bit more. This lass was truly good to him. Just so not to put him in a spot, she suppressed the indignance and sorrow she felt to smile to him.

Faced with such a Long Xiaoxiao, Chu Feng felt deeply hesitant whether he should really say those words aloud. But in the end, he felt that it was still necessary to do so.

“Xiaoxiao, can you... promise me one thing?” Chu Feng asked.

“My little benefactor, feel free to ask anything of me!” Long Xiaoxiao replied heartily.

“Be it Long Ning, Kong Ci, or Xian Yun, they are all my friends. The strength and standing of my friends mean nothing to me; as long as I consider them as my friends, I’ll do everything I can to protect them. So, can I ask you not to hurt them?”

Chu Feng knew deep down that even though Long Xiaoxiao looked no different from a docile sheep before him, she was actually a vicious person deep down. This was apparent from how she had chosen to deal with the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.

He felt that it was necessary to say these words aloud because he was worried that Long Xiaoxiao would view Long Ning and the others as a threat and attempt to harm them.
