Chapter 5526: Chu Feng’s Plan

“What a waste.”

Chu Feng looked at the ash remains of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen as he shook his head. He would have considered going easy on them if not for them injuring Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, and the others.

He had already grasped the proper way to invoke the Lightning Flame Token back at the Totem Dragon Clan, so he knew how powerful it was. He had been keeping it as a survival means, but he ended up using it here.

But when he looked at the gleaming treasures lying on the ground, especially the huge saber covered in blue scales, he thought that the exchange was worth it. That was a God Armament, after all.

“Feel free to pick any treasures you like. There’s no need to stand on ceremony,” Chu Feng told the Totem Dragon Clansmen.

“Chu Feng, you should keep them instead,” Long Chengyu replied weakly.

“Indeed, young hero Chu Feng. You should take them. We don’t lack treasures,” the other Totem Dragon Clansmen chirped in as well.

“Very well. I shall help myself then.”

Chu Feng stowed away all of the treasures into his Cosmos Sack with a wave of his sleeves, except for the God Armament. He had currently reached Half-God level, but he still didn’t have a God Armament yet.

He did receive a God Armament from the Totem Dragon Clan’s Armory Hall, but the Silver Dragon Spear had used a seal to ensure that none of the other God Armaments could submit to him.

The earlier battle between Long Chengyu and the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman showed him that the top prodigies of the world of cultivation were not to be looked down on. Knowing that it would be highly disadvantageous for him to fight an enemy with a God Armament when he didn’t have one, he knew that he needed to urgently obtain one.

“I can’t use this God Armament?” Chu Feng murmured with a frown.

He realized that the blue-scaled saber could only be activated by a specific bloodline, which meant that only Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen could wield it.

“That God Armament should be one of the God Armaments forged by the mysterious world spiritist for the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan back then. Our Totem Dragon Clan did acquire quite a few weapons from the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan during the war, but all of their God Armaments had a restriction that prevented them from being wielded by anyone aside from Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen. As such, they are worth much less than other God Armaments,” Long Chengyu explained.

“The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan sure is disgusting!” Chu Feng exclaimed in annoyance, though he still stowed the God Armament into his Cosmos Sack.

It was still worth something even though he couldn’t wield it, after all.

“Brother Chu Feng, what happened earlier? The prowess of your Lightning Flame Token surpasses that of Half-God level,” Long Chengyu asked.

“That’s right. The prowess of the Lightning Flame Token has reached rank one True God level,” Chu Feng replied.

“How are you doing that? You brought out the full prowess of the Lightning Flame Token!” Long Chengyu widened his eyes in envy.

“Let’s talk later. I’ll treat you first.”

Chu Feng constructed a formation to treat Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, and others. Their physical body recovered swiftly with the help of pills and Chu Feng’s formation, though the wounds on their souls would take a bit more time to recover.

Weng!

Just then, a distant formation was completed by the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan.

“How are they completing the formations that quickly?” Long Zhizhi exclaimed in confusion.

The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan’s progress should have slowed down with the death of the strongest cultivator.

“That fellow Qi Weidao from the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan is unlikely to be anyone normal too. Gather all of the cultivating Totem Dragon Clansmen and tell them to wait for me here,” Chu Feng said as he drew out a map.

He didn’t know the layout of this realm; it was just a deduction based on the formations around the place. He had marked out the place that he thought was likely to be the safest here.

The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan would surely attempt to exact vengeance upon realizing that they had lost so many of their clansmen, making it important to gather the Totem Dragon Clansmen together lest they get preyed on.

After all, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had already said that the completion of the formation was of secondary concern; their safety should be prioritized.

“What are you going to do, Chu Feng?” Long Muxi asked.

She sensed that Chu Feng wasn’t planning to travel together with them.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan was planning to dominate this formation, right?”

Chu Feng looked at the incomplete formation not too far away. That formation was the reason behind the outbreak of conflict between the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan and the Totem Dragon Clan.

“Those deranged monsters are the same as their ancestors, unreasonable and barbarous. They deserve to be killed a thousand times over!” Long Chengyu spat with gritted teeth.

“I’ll take over that formation. The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan will surely send some men over to investigate the matter. If the group that comes is weak, I’ll make sure that all of them die here. Otherwise, I’ll at least scout out their strength. In any case, you should just wait for me at the place I have pointed out. I’ll meet you there once I’m done with my business here,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll stay with you. We can at least cover each other,” Long Chengyu said.

“You should stay with your clansmen to protect them in case they encounter any Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen. Don’t worry about me. I can run away even if I’m no match for them,” Chu Feng replied.

“Indeed! Young hero Chu Feng can run at speeds comparable to rank nine Half-God level cultivators!” Long Zhizhi said.

“Are you sure? Aren’t you… a rank three Half-God level cultivator?” Long Chengyu was taken aback.

Even Long Muxi was stunned as well. She was the one who knew Chu Feng the best, but she didn’t know that he could run that quickly.

“I have a treasure that significantly boosts my speed. No Half-God level cultivator will be able to catch up with me if I raise my cultivation to rank six Half-God level. I’ll be safe as long as there are no True God level cultivators amongst the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen,” Chu Feng said.

“You don’t have to worry about that. There’s no True God level junior in the vast world of cultivation,” Long Chengyu said with a smile. “Brother Chu Feng, I didn’t think that you would have so many tricks hidden up your sleeves, though it’s not that surprising considering that it’s you. You were able to draw out even the true prowess of the Lightning Flame Token. I always thought that it was other people’s honor to receive my acknowledgment, but I have to say that it’s my utmost fortune to have met a friend like you.”

“Let’s not talk about these now lest we waste Chu Feng’s time. Let’s get moving,” Long Muxi urged.

“Ah…” Long Chengyu felt a bit indignant. It was from the bottom of his heart that he was complimenting Chu Feng. However, he obediently nodded and replied, “All right.”
