Chapter 2734 - Spreading Of Information

While Chu Xuanyuan, with his age, could only be considered to be a member of the younger generation before the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master and Elder Tuoba, he held an extremely high status in their hearts.

The status he held in their hearts even surpassed that of the current strongest individual in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Being excessively overeager will instead produce the opposite of the desired result. Rest assured, I have done all that should be done.”

“If this Chu Feng is someone that will repay kindness and grace, then what I’ve done is enough to leave a good impression on him.”

“If he’s an ungrateful individual, even if do more, it will all be futile.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Moreover, it’s merely a guess of ours that Chu Feng is Chu Xuanyuan’s son. We have no way to verify it,” the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

“What Lord Villa Master says is very correct,” Elder Tuoba nodded.

......

Chu Feng had already left. However, due to the fact that he had left secretly, the people, apart from those of the Immortal Armament Villa, did not know that he had already left.

They were all waiting for Chu Feng. They wanted to use the opportunity to become acquainted with him.

Although Chu Feng’s cultivation could be said to be very weak in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, his potential was inestimable.

The crowd all knew very well what Chu Feng was worth.

At the same time that they were waiting for Chu Feng, they were also discussing among themselves and making guesses regarding Chu Feng’s identity incessantly.

Naturally, there were people that thought of whether or not Chu Feng might be Chu Xuanyuan’s son.

After all, Chu Feng had the same name as Chu Xuanyuan’s son.

Furthermore, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was a signature of Chu Xuanyuan and Chu Hanxian.

Of course, the crowd only dared to keep this sort of guess in their own hearts. No one dared to speak their guesses aloud.

Regardless, Chu Feng’s famed name would spread throughout the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm from that day forward.

......

Information spread very quickly. Even the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan started to find out about Chu Feng.

In the Chu Heavenly Clan. In a luxurious palace chamber. Chu Xianshuo was kneeling on the ground. Bloody wounds filled his body and face.

Those were clearly new wounds. Furthermore, they were whip lashes.

A man was sitting in the main seat of that palace chamber.

That man should normally be quite short and very ugly.

The reason for the word ‘should’ was because he was even uglier at that moment.

He was a blind man. His eyeballs were gone. They seemed to have been dug out by someone.

Furthermore, his body was also badly damaged. He had no legs, and even his palms were not intact. He only had a single finger left.

As for that man, his name was Chu Kongtong.

He was the same man who arrived at the Ancestral Lower Martial Realm, entered the Heavenly Road, insulted the Old Ape and dug out Chu Feng’s tomb.

Chu Kongtong’s actions ended up infuriating Chu Xuanyuan. That was how he had ended up in his current state.

After Chu Kongtong was injured by Chu Xuanyuan, he returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and sought countless treatments. Unfortunately, no one was able to help him.

At that moment, not only was he badly mutilated, but even his cultivation was much inferior to before. Not only was he unable to make progress in his cultivation, but his cultivation was also decreasing nonstop. No matter how he tried to train, it was all useless.

As his cultivation continued to decrease, he grew weaker and weaker.

Furthermore, that Chu Kongtong was actually Chu Xianshuo’s father.

“Useless trash! You actually had your first place in the hunt snatched away by an outsider?!”

“Furthermore, as a rank four True Immortal, you were actually defeated by a rank two True Immortal?!”

“You still have the face to return here?! If I were you, I would’ve killed myself!”

Chu Kongtong shouted furiously. As he spoke, he lashed the whip in his hand. “Paa, paa,” whipping noises began to sound repeatedly. The whip was hitting Chu Xianshuo’s body nonstop.

As for Chu Xianshuo, he endured the pain from the whipping. He continued to kneel on the ground without saying a single word.

He was shivering, but not because of the pain. Rather, it was because of fear. It could be seen that he was very afraid of his father.

“Aiyah, what are you doing?! Xianshuo has suffered enough! You, as his father, instead of consoling him, how could you add even more pressure on him like this?!”

Right at that moment, a young woman walked in. While that woman had a youthful appearance, she was actually Chu Xianshuo’s mother, Chu Kongtong’s wife.

“Why was he able to obtain first place in the hunting competition for nine years in a row? Was it really because there was no one in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that could match up to him?”

“Not to mention our Chu Heavenly Clan, even for the other powers, they possessed younger generations stronger than him.”

“Why was he able to continue to obtain first place nine years in a row? That’s because those actual geniuses simply looked down on that hunting competition, and were disinclined to even participate.”

“Yet, even in these sorts of circumstances, he actually lost! He is utter trash!”

“Trash like him has completely disgraced me, Chu Kongtong. So what if I reprimand him? If I still had the temperament I had back then, I would’ve beaten him to death!” Chu Kongtong spoke very furiously.

“Father, it’s enough. Stop reprimanding big brother. Isn’t it a mere brat that just appeared out of nowhere? I will take care of him for big brother in the future. I will have everyone in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm know that your, Chu Kongtong’s, son is not a trash.”

Right at that moment, another voice was heard. A young man walked in.

That man’s appearance resembled Chu Xianshuo’s a lot. Merely, he was much younger.

While his age might be younger than Chu Xianshuo’s, his cultivation was much stronger.

Although he was young, he was actually a rank seven True Immortal.

His cultivation could be said to be very frightening among the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generations.

That person was one of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s five demon-level geniuses, Chu Hanyu.

That Chu Hanyu was also Chu Xianshuo’s biological younger brother, Chu Kongtong’s son.

“Hanyu, you’ve returned? Hanyu, you’ve finally returned.”

“Come, come to your father’s side.”

Chu Kongtong immediately became excited upon hearing Chu Hanyu’s voice. He was overjoyed. Even his furious mood disappeared in an instant.

“Lord Father,” Chu Hanyu walked over to Chu Kongtong. He had a very respectful expression on his face.

“You, take your trash of a son and get the hell out of here,” Chu Kongtong pointed to his wife.

At that moment, Chu Kongtong’s wife revealed an awkward expression. However, in the end, she smiled politely at Chu Hanyu and then took Chu Xianshuo with her and left.

It would appear that while Chu Xianshuo and Chu Hanyu were born from the same father, they were not born from the same mother.

They were half brothers.

“Hanyu, you have been gone for an entire year to train. Have you managed to obtain a good harvest? What cultivation are you at now?”

Chu Kongtong gently caressed Chu Hanyu beside him in a very excited manner. From his actions, one could tell how much he pampered him.

“Father... you’re no longer able to sense what level of cultivation your son has?”

“Father, your cultivation?” Suddenly, Chu Hanyu was stunned. Grief and pain filled his eyes.

His father’s cultivation had been decreasing nonstop. And now, it had actually decreased to a level where he was no longer able to sense his son’s cultivation.

One should know that his father used to be a Martial Immortal-level expert. However... his cultivation had now decreased to that of a rank six True Immortal.

“Your father is useless. I’m afraid that my cultivation is inferior to Hanyu’s now.”

“In that case, Hanyu, you’re a rank seven True Immortal then? Great. As expected of my, Chu Kongtong’s, son. You’ve done very well,” Chu Kongtong said.

“No, it’s not that father is useless. Rather, it’s that Chu Xuanyuan. He’s simply too vicious and merciless.”

“Father, please rest assured. Your son will definitely do his best to train. I will one day make that Chu Xuanyuan pay the price.”

“I will return the pain that he has caused you a hundredfold, a thousandfold.”

Chu Hanyu spoke with rage between gritted teeth. From this, it could be seen how much he hated Chu Xuanyuan.

“Very good. You are truly my son. Hanyu, if your father wants revenge, I can only rely on you.”

“You’ve also seen that trash older brother of yours. I have painstakingly nurtured him for all these years. Yet he still ended up being such a disappointment, still ended up being trash.”

“He failed to even take care of a mere Immortal Armament Villa’s hunting competition. What could he possibly accomplish?”

“Right now, all of father’s hopes and wishes are on you. You are the only hope for father now,” Chu Kongtong said.

“Father, please rest assured. Your son will definitely not disappoint you,” Chu Hanyu said.

“I trust you, I trust you.”

“Hanyu, now that you’ve returned, are you planning to go out again?” Chu Kongtong asked concernedly.
