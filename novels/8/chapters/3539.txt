Chapter 3539 - Mysterious Black-cloaked Person

Actually, Moyi Qing knew very well what their Moyi Heavenly Clan’s opinion of the Chu Heavenly Clan was.

Their Moyi Heavenly Clan was merely observing Chu Feng’s talent. The person that they truly wanted to curry favor with was Chu Xuanyuan.

The reason for that was because there was a rumor that Chu Xuanyuan’s cultivation had not declined, but had instead progressed to an even more tyrannical level. Furthermore, it was very likely that he had already returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

With the situation being like that, Moyi Qing actually also felt that he should not make an enemy out of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, faced with the enticement of the golden fruit, he ended up losing his sense of propriety. And now, although he had given up on plundering the golden fruit, he... was feeling extremely unreconciled for being humiliated before so many people.

Thus, he pointed to the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and shouted angrily, “You speak of respecting the rules in such a righteous manner, but in the end, aren’t you merely bullying the weak and fearing the strong? Otherwise... when that Divine Body Royal City’s brat was plundering other fruits all over the place, why didn’t you step forth to stop him?”

“That’s very simple. That’s because the people he was plundering the fruits from were all people like you and I, guests who came to this place.”

“As for you, you were trying to snatch away a fruit that belonged to the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“This place is the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. The owner of this place is the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“The Chu Heavenly Clan is already being extremely magnanimous to allow us to enter this place. They have given us enough face. Thus, how could you attempt to plunder their possessions?” said the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

Suddenly, a series of claps could be heard. Following the applause, a resounding voice was heard, “Well said!”

Looking in the direction of the voice, the crowd noticed that it was said by an individual clad in a black cloak.

The black-cloaked individual appeared very mysterious. The crowd was unable to see his face, and had no idea who he was. In fact, even his aura was completely concealed.

“Who are you?” the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Who I am is not important. However, I will have to speak out for the injustice this Elder Moyi suffered.”

“The words you said earlier could be said to be devoted to righteousness, and inspired by reverence. You were speaking as if you were the emissary of justice. However, as far as I know, your Li Heavenly Clan is not righteous at all. Earlier, when the Upper Realm Gate opened, I seemed to recall that you all had wanted to seize the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, no?”

“And now, you’re here speaking so righteously, do you feel no shame?”

That black-cloaked individual’s words were filled with mockery.

“That’s right. Neither of us are good people, why are you trying to pretend here?” Moyi Qing began to clap his hands in a very pleased manner.

“You...” The Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief became extremely furious. However, he could not find a way to refute the claim. After all, it was true that their Li Heavenly Clan had wanted to take care of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Furthermore, Li Taiyi had even tried to kill the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Many people had witnessed what had happened back then too.

Their Li Heavenly Clan was indeed in the wrong. He could not find a way to refute that.

“As for Clan Chief Chu, I will also have to say something to you,” That black-cloaked individual turned his gaze to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Good brother, go ahead and say what you wish to say,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief clasped his fist. His attitude was very respectful.

However, that black-cloaked individual did not appreciate the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s gesture of courtesy. With an extremely mocking tone, he said, “So many people have arrived in your Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm with the intention to befriend your clan right now. But did you really think that they are doing that because they respect your Chu Heavenly Clan?”

“The only thing they care about is the strength of Chu Xuanyuan, and his son Chu Feng. As for you all, you are nothing more than trash in their eyes.”

“One must be able to conduct oneself with self-awareness.”

“That golden fruit is something that should be obtained by he who is capable. Ask yourself this, do you really think you’re qualified to obtain it?”

After hearing the black-cloaked individual’s words, the people from the various powers all turned their eyes to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Although they did not say anything, their gazes revealed that they agreed with that black-cloaked individual’s words.

They all felt that if the golden fruit was obtained by one who was capable, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief really would not be qualified to obtain it.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief showed no signs of displeasure toward the black-cloaked individual’s words and the crowd’s gazes. Instead, he revealed a faint smile.

“If the golden fruit is something that should be obtained by the capable, then, this old man feels that, amongst everyone here, I really do possess the qualifications to obtain this golden fruit,” he said.

Once his words were spoken, the crowd’s expressions all changed. They were all looking to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief strangely.

Evidently, they had not expect him to say that sort of thing.

Who gave him that confidence?

With his strength, how could he be qualified to obtain the golden fruit?

He was simply delusional.

“Hahaha...” The black-cloaked individual directly burst into laughter.

“Truly, never would I have imagined you to be this thick-skinned at your age,” That black-cloaked man’s laughter was very mocking.

“After saying all of this, didn’t you come here for the golden fruit yourself?”

“However, with I, Dragon King Li, here, you will definitely not be able to have your way with it.”

As the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he walked toward the black-cloaked individual aggressively.

“Putt~~~”

Suddenly, the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief fell at his knees.

It was oppressive might. At that moment, everyone present was able to sense an enormous oppressive might being released, forcing the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to his knees.

As for that oppressive might, it was that of a rank nine Exalted.

The person who released that oppressive might was that mysterious black-cloaked individual. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Peak Exalted, Tantai Yinjian, never would I have expected you to be this despicable,” The Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to the black-cloaked man furiously.

He was not the only person who thought this way. Many people present also immediately thought of Tantai Yinjian.

After all, although there were a lot of experts present, Tantai Yinjian was the only peak Exalted-level expert.

Since that black-cloaked individual was unwilling to reveal himself, it meant that he was deliberately concealing his identity so that he could plunder the golden fruit.

But, why would he be unwilling to reveal his face? That was rather simple, it was because he was afraid that he would expose his identity.

After thinking about it, apart from Tantai Yinjian, the crowd were unable to think of another person.

“Tantai Yinjian? Don’t compare me with that sort of trash,” That black-cloaked individual felt extremely displeased by the crowd’s guess.

“If you’re not Tantai Yinjian, then remove that black cloak and reveal your identity,” said the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Since you all are so inclined to see my face, I’ll let you all have a look.”

“However, I will have to tell you all this first. Those who see my face will all have to die.”

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, the black-cloaked individual waved his sleeve. He really removed the black cloak covering him.

“You!!!”

Upon seeing the true identity of the black-cloak individual, the expressions of the crowd all changed enormously. For many people, fear appeared on their faces.
