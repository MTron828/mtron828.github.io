Chapter 5176: Backing of the Two Masters

“Nameless Sect’s sectmaster, who are those two? Are they helpers you have brought here? Haven’t we agreed to talk things through? Are you planning on resorting to violence here?” an elder stood up from the war chariot and questioned the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster.

He was the city lord of Greenpeace City, one of the powers that had witnessed the alliance between the Nine Levels Pavilion and the World Spiritist Techniques Sect.

“City Lord Li, I have come with the intention to negotiate, but I’m not very sure about your impartiality anymore. Why have you come with those from the Nine Levels Pavilion? Are you colluding together?” the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster scoffed.

He wouldn’t have dared take such an attitude toward those people had it been in the past. After all, he was counting on them to take back control of the ancient remnant. However, he wasn’t afraid now because he had the two masters with him.

His change of attitude incurred the displeasure of the witnessing powers. Of course, they also understood the reason behind that.

“Nameless Sect’s sectmaster, we did attend a gathering in the Nine Levels Pavilion prior to coming here, but our friendship with the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster will not affect our stance in this negotiation. Our ancestors have entrusted us with the duty of upholding the sanctity of your alliance, so you can be assured of our neutrality.

“On the other hand, I have to question your intention behind bringing two outsiders here. Don’t you think that it’s inappropriate for you to do so?” City Lord Li asked.

“Indeed. You can just tell us straight if you aren’t planning to negotiate at all.”

The others chirped in agreement.

The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster was annoyed to see how the witnessing powers were siding with the Nine Levels Pavilion right from the start, but he swallowed his anger.

“I did invite these two masters here, but you can be assured that they won’t interfere in this matter as long as you maintain a neutral stance. Let’s not waste any time and get straight to the point.

“Back then, the ancestors of our Nameless Sect and the Nine Levels Pavilion discovered this ancient remnant together. They agreed to harvest the Exalted Stones together until it runs out. However, the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster is demanding our Nameless Sect to give up our rights to harvest the Exalted Stones now. Are you going to do anything about it?” the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster asked.

“Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster, tell us your reason for chasing the Nameless Sect out of the ancient remnant.”

The witnessing powers turned to the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster.

“My reason is simple. The ancestors of our Nine Levels Pavilion did make such an agreement with the ancestors of the Nameless Sect back then, but we shouldn’t forget the very basis of the agreement. We only chose to split it fairly because our ancestors were equally matched.

“However, our Nine Levels Pavilion has already surpassed the Nameless Sect during the era of our previous sectmaster. At that point, the Nameless Sect is already unqualified to be considered as our equal. It’s out of respect for the preceding sectmaster, who is also my benefactor, that I allowed the agreement to continue up to this point.

“My sympathy clearly didn’t allow the Nameless Sect to return to its peak. If anything, it has only been further spiraling into decline. I believe that it’s a waste to allow them to continue dominating the supply of Exalted Stones. To be more direct, I don’t think that the Nameless Sect has the right to continue harvesting Exalted Stones. I won’t allow our ancestors’ treasure to be squandered away by the Nameless Sect,” the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster said.

“You heard what he said. That’s the ridiculous reason he has come up with. Obviously, he has no intention of upholding our agreement!” the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster said.

Those from the witnessing powers shook their heads.

“Well… I actually think that there’s some sense in what the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster said. Cultivation resources are hard to come by, and it’s only right for it to go to the capable. It’s not as if the supply of Exalted Stones is unlimited; it’s only a matter of time before it runs out. It ought to be allocated to those deserving of it,” one of the elders from the witnessing powers said.

“You!!!”

Yue Ling’s master was infuriated to hear those words. Yue Ling also clenched her fists tightly in anger.

The witnessing powers were actually affirming the ridiculous logic of the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster. They were clearly taking advantage of them. There was indeed no such thing as justice in the world of cultivation. It was the strongest who had the loudest voice.

“Hahaha!”

The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster burst into laughter.

“I knew that the negotiations would not favor us right from the start, but I thought that you would at least find a less brazen excuse when you side with the Nine Levels Pavilion. It looks like you aren’t even bothering to keep up with the pretense anymore. It’s fortunate that I came prepared.”

The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster turned to the two masters behind him and said, “Masters, you heard what they said. They have completely no regard for our Nameless Sect at all. I ask you to redress our grievances.”

In contrast to the infuriated Nameless Sect’s sectmaster, the two masters looked much more relaxed. They first stroked their beard before replying, “Rest assured, Nameless Sect’s sectmaster. We brothers will fulfill the end of our bargain. Those trash actually dared to act so arrogantly when you’re under our protection; there’s no way we would turn a blind eye to this.”

The two masters walked in front of the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster.

“Are the two of you planning to stand up for the Nameless Sect?” the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster asked.

Boom!

Brilliant light suddenly shone from the two masters, completely covering the sky. It was spirit power comparable to that of peak Martial Exalted level cultivators. This was the prowess of rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists.

Under the pressure of the spirit power, the faces of those from the Nine Levels Pavilion warped in pain. Even their sectmaster was only at rank eight Martial Exalted level, so how could the rest of them possibly withstand such pressure. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“That’s right. What are you going to do about it?”

“Kneel down, kowtow, admit your fault to the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster, cripple your own cultivation, and get out of this realm right now. If you do that, I’ll at least spare your lives. Otherwise…”

“Otherwise what?”

Before the two masters could finish their words, a voice suddenly boomed from the sky. Someone was hiding in the sky.

It was obvious that the hiding person had hostile intent, but the two masters were unfazed.

“What else? I’ll massacre your entire clan,” one of the masters replied before striking his palm toward the direction of the voice.
