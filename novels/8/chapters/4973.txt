Chapter 4973: Godwish Grandmother’s Daughter

Wang Yuxian was here too, but she wasn’t in the city at the moment. She had followed the Lady of Dao Sea and the others into the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound.

Other than that, Chu Feng also looked into the strength of the elders.

The strongest of them all was the elder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. On top of being a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator, she was also a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation World Spiritist.&nbsp;

The elder from the Silver Crane Hall was at rank eight Martial Exalted level, and the remaining ones were all beneath rank eight.&nbsp;

They weren’t the strongest in terms of cultivation, but they were skilled world spiritists. In fact, thirteen of them had reached rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation.

Song Feifei didn’t know the Godwish Grandmother’s cultivator, but she did know her own master’s cultivation. The Lady of Dao Sea was a rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivator.

That was good news to Chu Feng since this meant that no one was a threat to Shengguang Baimei other than the elder from the Situ World Spiritist Clan.&nbsp;

He didn’t expect to meet the Lady of Dao Sea and the others here, but they should be able to enter the ancient remnant without a hitch too.&nbsp;

“Senior Feifei, our martial aunt’s daughter is asking us over,” a female disciple of the Lady of Dao Sea suddenly called out from the doorway.

“I’m coming over!”

Song Feifei quickly rose to her feet as she said, “Chu Feng, you rest here first. I’ll call you once my master and Lele return.”

However, the female disciple outside said, “Senior Song, our martial aunt’s daughter asks us to bring Chu Feng along as well.”

Song Feifei was surprised to hear those words.&nbsp;

“I have to go too?”&nbsp;

Chu Feng was equally surprised too.

Seeing Chu Feng’s reluctant expression, Song Feifei put on a sweet smile and said, “Let’s go. Since she’s asking us over, let’s go together. She’s a beauty.”

“I’m not interested in beauties. However, if she’s your martial aunt’s daughter, does that mean that she’s the daughter of the Godwish Grandmother?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

‘Indeed. She’s the sole daughter of my martial aunt,” Song Feifei replied.

“Then I ought to head over to take a look.”

Chu Feng had never heard that the Godwish Grandmother had a daughter, so he was quite intrigued to hear that. He was a little curious as to what the Godwish Grandmother’s daughter would look like.

So, he rose to his feet and headed off together with Song Feifei.

They arrived at a majestic palace located at the heart of the city. Senior Qiu and the others whom Chu Feng had met earlier were present, and there were a few new faces too. However, it was worth noting that they were all juniors.&nbsp;

Chu Feng deduced that all of the juniors were currently gathered in this city.&nbsp;

As soon as he entered the vicinity, Senior Qiu from Starspecter Valley directed him a look of hostility. It was just that there were too many people around, so he quickly retracted his gaze afterward and continued his conversation with his fellow peers.

Chu Feng noticed that there was a look of anticipation in their eyes, and he soon found out the reason for it.

They were looking forward to meeting the daughter of the Godwish Grandmother. Most of them appeared to harbor goodwill toward her, including Senior Qiu.

This left Chu Feng even more curious as to how beautiful the Godwish Grandmother’s daughter was that even the juniors of the Totem Galaxy were moved by her appearance. After all, there were many beauties in the Dao Sea as well, including Wang Yuxian and Song Feifei.

Creak!

The doors to the majestic palace finally opened, and a person walked out from within. The crowd immediately turned their eyes over, only to be disappointed by what they had seen.

Senior Qiu and the others were rolled their eyes and sighed in disappointment, expressing their displeasure.

The person who had just walked out wasn’t the gorgeous daughter of the Godwish Grandmother but an old hag. She was the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother.

“Elder.”

In contrast, Chu Feng clasped his fist and greeted the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple with a smile. The latter did free him from the quandary he was in earlier on.

Shoosh!

A flash of light suddenly whizzed across the side of the Godwish Grandmother’s side and rushed for Chu Feng. Chu Feng subconsciously tried to dodge it, but he froze up upon seeing the other party’s appearance.

He recognized the other party.

It was Song Yun.

“Big brother Chu Feng!”

While Chu Feng was still overwhelmed by shock, Song Yun leaped into Chu Feng’s embrace and hugged him tightly. She buried her beautiful face into his chest. The excitement and intimacy she displayed wouldn’t pale in comparison to Yaoyao when she encountered Chu Feng earlier.&nbsp;

Yaoyao was only a child and treated Chu Feng as her father, so her intimate actions were understandable, but the same couldn’t be said about Song Yun. Song Yun was a beautiful woman at the peak of her youth, so the crowd couldn’t help but be startled by her actions.&nbsp; Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This was especially so for the male disciples from Starspecter Valley, Silver Crane Hall, and Soaringflow Heaven Sect

Their mouths opened in shock, and envy and enmity could be seen reflected in their eyes. It looked like they would want nothing more than to slice Chu Feng into countless pieces.

Song Feifei and the other disciples of the Lady of Dao Sea were taken aback too.

However, Chu Feng chose not to pay them any heed. He pulled Song Yun out of his embrace before locking his eyes on her face.

“Lass, what brings you here?”

Chu Feng was overjoyed to be able to reunite with Song Yun. The last time they parted ways, they were on the Wretched Black Demon’s turf, where Song Yun fed him a pearl that enhanced his spirit power. That proved to be of great help to him.&nbsp;

He wanted to find an opportunity to properly thank her, but who could have thought that they would cross paths here?

“No, that’s not right. You…”

It was a little slow, but Chu Feng soon connected the dots together. He was able to verify his deduction with a quick glance at the faces around him. Nevertheless, he still asked the question to confirm it.&nbsp;

“Lass, you can’t possibly be… the daughter of the Godwish Grandmother, are you?”

“I am!”

Song Yun nodded her head with a happy smile.

Chu Feng was left at a loss for words after hearing Song Yun confirm her identity. It was a huge surprise.&nbsp;

He remembered the lass telling him that her parents were dead, and she only had an older sister to rely on. But all of a sudden, he found out that her mother was still alive, and she was none other than the renowned Godwish Grandmother.&nbsp;

It was a little too much to digest at the moment.

Older sister?

Chu Feng suddenly recalled another person, which made him cast his gaze on the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple. It just so happened that the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple was looking at Chu Feng with a teasing smile, contrary to her usual cold attitude.&nbsp;

It was only then that Chu Feng finally made sense of things.&nbsp;
