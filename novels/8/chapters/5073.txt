Chapter 5073: Entering the Asura Graveyard Once More

“Yaoyao, are you really able to control those Asura Evil Spirits? Can you tell me what you know?” Chu Feng asked.

He wanted to first clarify the situation before diving into it.

“Of course. I wouldn’t tell anyone else but daddy!”

Yaoyao quickly recounted what she knew.

She wasn’t too sure about how she came about, and her memories traced back to a time before Chu Feng entered the Asura Graveyard. She said that the Asura Evil Spirits identified themselves as the Asura World Spirit Army, and they were currently trapped inside the Asura Graveyard.

They had created Yaoyao with the intent to free themselves from the Asura Graveyard, and their plan was a success. Yaoyao had the power to free them and control the Asura World Spirit Army.

In fact, the ritual they had conducted back then around Yaoyao was to free them from the Asura Graveyard. That was why they shouted: Once we destroy all obstacles in our way, we shall dye the blue sky red with blood!

They had simply been trapped and suppressed for far too long.

Who could have thought that Chu Feng would steal Yaoyao from the Asura Graveyard before the ritual started? It could be said that Chu Feng had ruined their plan.

“But why did Lord Yunliang help the Wretched Black Demon?” Chu Feng asked.

He sensed that Lord Yunliang was a good person, so he likely had his own reason for betraying the Asura Evil Spirits.

“Ahh… I don’t know either. Daddy, you should take me to the Asura Graveyard. As long as I’m here, they won’t dare to hurt you!” Yaoyao said.

“Who could have thought that I would end up getting saved by my daughter?”

Chu Feng patted Yaoyao’s little head as ravenous joy burst from his heart. He took Yaoyao to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s teleportation formation and made his way toward the Nine Souls Galaxy’s Asura Graveyard.

Oblivious to Chu Feng, a person suddenly appeared right in front of the teleportation formation just a moment after the two of them stepped into it. It was the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

She eyed the teleportation formation before heading back to her palace. Along the way, she encountered Duan Liufeng.

“Lord Sectmaster, please reconsider this matter. I know that you have a high opinion of Chu Feng, and…”

Before Duan Liufeng could finish his words, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster raised his hand, indicating for him to stop talking.

“Your younger brother Chu Feng has already left the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. He’ll be safe,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

A smile broke out on Duan Liufeng’s face upon hearing those words. He thought that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was going to help Chu Feng. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Lord Sectmaster, I knew that you wouldn’t leave Chu Feng to the lurch!”

However, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster shook her head.

“He doesn’t need my help.”

“Ah?”

Duan Liufeng was taken aback by those words. Before he could react, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster had already vanished from sight, leaving just a couple of words in her wake.

“You won’t be able to help Chu Feng. Focus on your own affairs instead.”

…

After traveling for a while, Chu Feng and Yaoyao finally arrived at the Graveyard Realm.

The Asura Graveyard also happened to be the Wretched Black Demon’s territory, so the two of them had made sure to conceal themselves through a formation. Fortunately, they were able to get to the entrance of the Asura Graveyard without alerting anyone.

Just like before, the Asura Graveyard exerted tremendous pressure on Chu Feng. He felt both anticipation and fear. He never thought a day would come where the Asura Evil Spirits inside the Asura Graveyard would become his saviors.

“Yaoyao, will they really listen to you?” Chu Feng asked once more.

He knew just how terrifying and powerful those Asura Evil Spirits were. There was no turning back once they entered the Asura Graveyard, so he sought another confirmation from Yaoyao.

“Just like how daddy protects me, I’ll protect you in the Asura Graveyard!” Yaoyao nodded confidently.

She looked particularly adorable when she said those words.

“Alright, let’s head in then.”

Chu Feng dispelled his concealment formation and leaped down the entrance of the Asura Graveyard together with Yaoyao. They passed through several powerful barriers along the way, but these barriers didn’t stop their path since they were intended to keep those Asura Evil Spirits from escaping.

Just like that, he successfully entered the Asura Graveyard.

“Intruders!”

But barely after he entered the area, he encountered a group of towering Asura Evil Spirits. They were armored and armed, and the aura they were emanating indicated that they were at least at rank six Martial Exalted level.

There were initially only a hundred of them, but with a mere shout, another thousand immediately rushed to the scene. To make things worse, more and more of them were heading in their direction, and the pressure they exerted increased correspondingly.

The Asura Evil Spirits who encircled them at the start were only at rank six Martial Exalted level, but the reinforcements had plenty who were at pinnacle Martial Exalted level. Furthermore, their dress-up indicated that they were only footsoldiers.

It was likely that those who held leadership positions amongst the Asura Evil Spirits were at Half-God level at the very least.

“Intruders? Who are you saying are intruders?” Yaoyao said with a displeased tone.

She emanated a black aura as she spoke. It was asura power.

“This!!!”

Chu Feng and the surrounding Asura Evil Spirits were stunned upon sensing the asura power.

Yaoyao’s cultivation was still low, but the asura power she summoned was extraordinarily powerful. It exerted a natural pressure on the Asura Evil Spirits present, compelling their obedience. This made them realize that Yaoyao was not just anyone.

“Call your Asura King here. Tell him that the person who can bring you out of the Asura Graveyard has arrived!” Yaoyao said.

Despite being a child, her attitude was extremely haughty. She behaved as if she was truly the master of these Asura Evil Spirits.

The Asura Evil Spirits were doubtful of Yaoyao’s words, but they didn’t dare to make a move on her out of apprehension of her powerful asura power. Some of the Asura Evil Spirits quickly headed off to inform their leaders of the current happenings.
