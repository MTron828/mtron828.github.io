MGA: Chapter 872 - Unrelated to You

“Senior Qiushui, you’ve heard about it?” Chu Feng couldn’t help but be taken aback by those words.

He had never told her that Huangfu Haoyue went mad. He only said he saw him in the continent of the Nine Provinces. Reasonably speaking, Qiushui Fuyan shouldn’t know that Huangfu Haoyue went insane, unless...

“Answer me first. Has Huangfu Haoyue gone insane?” Qiushui Fuyan quickly asked.

“This...” Chu Feng was in a bit of an awkward situation while facing that question. To a certain degree, the reason of Huangfu Haoyue’s insanity was related to his father. At least, he assumed he was.

But even so, Chu Feng couldn’t bear hiding the truth from Qiushui Fuyan because she had truly treated himself well. Ever since she saved him from Ya Fei, she had given Chu Feng much help.

So, in the end, Chu Feng still said, “Senior Qiushui, when I saw Huangfu Haoyue for the first time, he had already went insane.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“As I thought... As I thought, it’s him.” Qiushui Fuyan instantly felt downcast.

“Senior Qiushui, what’s wrong? Yo-you didn’t see Senior Huangfu, right?” Chu Feng thought of a possibility when he heard her words.

“I saw him. The reason I returned so late from the Winter Plains is because I saw him there.

“However, he doesn’t even recognize me anymore. I chased after him for a long time, and passed through several regions, yet in the end, I still lost him. Even though he had changed a lot, that feeling of his would never change. I knew he was Huangfu Haoyue.” Qiushui Fuyan even choked a bit when she said that.

“Senior Qiushui, sorry I hid it from you. I should have told you earlier.

“Also...”

“Chu Feng, you don’t need to say anything, nor do you need to feel any shame. I know why you didn’t tell be at the very beginning, and I also know why Huangfu Haoyue has turned into this.

“How would I discover nothing after following him for so long? I could tell he was afraid of something, and if I’m not mistaken, the existence he’s afraid of is related to you, right?” Qiushui Fuyan’s tone was very soft. It could be seen she didn’t resent Chu Feng.

“Senior Qiushui, I can’t give you a definite answer either. I’ve also been thinking that the ones Huangfu Haoyue is afraid of is my family,” Chu Feng replied truthfully. Only then could the shame he felt diminish a bit.

“Chu Feng, you don’t need to be like this. Back then, when Huangfu Haoyue carried you here, you were still a baby. No matter what he experienced—and even if your family did something to him—it’s your family’s fault. None of it is related to you, so you don’t need to feel ashamed.

“Moreover, it’s already a matter of the past. What we should do right now is think of a way to cure him. Although he’s gone mad, it’s only madness. As a World Spiritist, you should know there’s nothing a World Spiritist can’t do, especially related to deficiencies of one’s body. We can heal that as well,” Qiushui Fuyan said.

“Mm, Senior Qiushui, you’re right. But, what are you planning to do?” Chu Feng felt quite a bit better after hearing Qiushui Fuyan’s words,

“Right now, the most important thing is to first find Huangfu Haoyue. I’ve prepared to leave today in order to search for him,” Qiushui Fuyan said.

“But do you know where Senior Huangfu is right now?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know, but even if I don’t know, I must still look for him. Even if I need to search the entire world I must still find him. I can’t let him live a beggar’s life in insanity,” Qiushui Fuyan resolutely said.

“Senior Qiushui, how about I contact the Crippling Night Demon Sect and ask them to help you?” Chu Feng said.

“No need. As they say, rather than asking others, why not ask oneself? Putting aside the fact they aren’t that close to you, so not everyone will believe you, I also don’t trust them too much.

“I’m not too friendly with the higher-ups of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, so how can I hope for them to help me?” Qiushui Fuyan shook her head, firmly rejecting Chu Feng’s thought.

“Senior is correct.” Chu Feng nodded after hearing Qiushui Fuyan’s words. Although she was a bit too cautious, her considerations were absolutely reasonable.

Even though the Crippling Night Demon Sect was treating Chu Feng quite well, they still didn’t completely trust Chu Feng yet. At least, the Crippling Night Demon Sect still emphasized the gains of the sect; Chu Feng was merely a member.

If there were truly one day when Chu Feng’s existence threatened the benefit of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, who knew if they would deal with him in the future or not.

Chu Feng would not forget the gazes of the Earth King and the others when he attempted to pull out the Royal Armament, the Demon Sealing Sword. At that time, Chu Feng truly felt if he had pulled it out, the Earth King would have killed Chu Feng with no hesitation because that was a weapon only usable by the head of the Demon Sect.

The Crippling Night Demon Sect wouldn’t hand such an armament over to Chu Feng.

“Okay, Chu Feng, then it’s decided. As of now, just let me look for Huangfu Haoyue.

“At present, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is still searching for you. Unless absolutely necessary, for safety’s sake, it’s best that you stay in the Misty Peak and avoid leaving,” Qiushui Fuyan reminded.

“Senior, thank you for the reminder. I understand.” Chu Feng nodded.

“Remember, don’t feel ashamed because of Huangfu Haoyue. Even if it’s related to your family, it’s not related to you.

“Also, I’ve chatted with your three fiancées and found out they are quite decent in many places. Most importantly, they do truly love you.

“So, do not disappoint them. You should take care of yourself even if just for their sake. Don’t do overly risky things and take your life as a joke.”

After speaking, Qiushui Fuyan lightly smiled, then rose into the air, flying towards the Teleportation Array.

From this, one could tell she was truly concerned with Huangfu Haoyue. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have headed out so quickly to search for him.

After Qiushui Fuyan left, Chu Feng entered the Misty Peak. He first went to Zi Ling’s residence, and when he came, not only were Su Rou and Su Mei there, even Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang were there.

“Junior Chu Feng, I’ve heard you’re now a rank five Martial Lord. Is that true?” After seeing Chu Feng, Zhang Tian and Jiang Wushang quickly surrounded him. From head to toe, they carefully examined him.
