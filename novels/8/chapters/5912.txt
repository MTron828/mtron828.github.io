Chapter 5913: It Happened Two Hundred Years Ago

Chu Feng and Zi Ling had already concealed themselves after emerging from the teleportation formation, so others couldn’t see them unless they allowed it. Thus, no one knew that they had been there even though they were the first ones to arrive there.

As the crowd had fled out of fear, everyone thought that this city was emptied.

“Big brother Chu Feng, do you think what’s inside the formation is the key fragment?” Zi Ling asked.

“There’s such a possibility,” Chu Feng replied.

“I didn’t expect the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to be so vicious. They could have just taken the formation away with them; there’s no need to massacre the entire Tan Clan.” Zi Ling was getting more and more certain this was the doing of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Based on what they had heard, normal people couldn’t hope to faze or move the formation here away, but it had disappeared now. Who else other than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had the means to do that?

Not to mention the formation was the very goal of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“I don’t get it,” Zi Ling said.

Chu Feng had been observing the area when he heard Zi Ling’s words, so he asked, “What don’t you get?”

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had the means to silently take whatever they wanted with them; did they have to go on a massacre?” Zi Ling asked.

“They do it because they are strong enough,” Chu Feng replied.

“Strong enough?” Zi Ling thought that the reason was ridiculous. How could being strong enough be a reason to massacre tens of millions?

“They saw those as mere ants, and they wanted to do a clean job as this matter concerns the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasure. They couldn’t allow anything to go wrong. Yes, the Tan Clan wouldn’t have been an obstacle to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but the latter felt more at ease with their deaths. If trampling on a bunch of ants could bring you ease of mind, how many people would be willing to do it?” Chu Feng replied.

“But they aren’t ants like living people!” Zi Ling exclaimed.

“That’s why I said they are strong enough. And they have been strong for far too long a time. That bred their arrogance and coldness. They think that they have truly become gods, so they started seeing the rest of the world as ants,” Chu Feng replied.

“I would never do such a thing even if I became strong,” Zi Ling replied.

“That’s because my Zi Ling is a good person, but this is a world that follows the survival of the fittest. How many good people can there be in this world? However, I agree that someone with principles should call the shots, and that person should at least not massacre the innocent and be willing to stand up for the weak. If all of the galaxy overlords were good people, the world of cultivation need not be how it is now.” Chu Feng said on a whim.

Zi Ling nodded vehemently in agreement.

She had worked hard on her cultivation in hopes that she could help Chu Feng instead of pulling him back. She wanted to be able to fight alongside him the way they first met. However, she had now found a new reason for her to become strong.

The world shouldn’t be the way it was.

The strong should use their powers to help the world instead of being self-entitled and squeezing everything they lorded over dry. If she ever governed a land, she would make sure to establish order and protect the weak.

“Big brother Chu Feng, what are you looking for?” Zi Ling asked.

She realized that Chu Feng had been looking around amid their chatter, even taking out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. And the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk had provided him with its guidance too. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, she was unable to discern anything at all.

“I’m looking for clues,” Chu Feng replied.

“Did you find anything?” Zi Ling asked.

“Jie Tianran likely sent one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elders here instead of coming down himself,” Chu Feng replied.

“What makes you say that?” Zi Ling asked.

“The formation they took might not be the real one. There’s another unfathomable formation hidden here. I can sense it, but I’m unable to put my finger on it. It’s an ingenious creation. I’ll need to find the key to activate it.

“This hidden formation is extremely important. If Jie Tianran was here, he would have noticed it, and he wouldn’t have left this place just like that,” Chu Feng replied.

“So, the formation that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion took away might not have the treasure at all?” Zi Ling asked.

“That’s hard to say, but the hidden formation is formidable. I guess that the hidden formation is the real formation, whereas what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion took away is just bait. Even so, the bait formation is still incredibly powerful. They shouldn’t have been able to take it away under normal means. Something must have happened here,” Chu Feng said.

“What happened?” Zi Ling asked.

“I can only tell that it happened two hundred years ago. It was due to that incident that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was able to take away the unmovable formation.”

Chu Feng continued examining the area, but those were all the clues here. He figured that if there was truly a key fragment here, it was likely to still be here.

“Let’s go, Zi Ling.” Chu Feng took Zi Ling away with him.

While they were flying away, he began constructing a formation. Zi Ling was initially confused until an old man appeared in front of them. It was the old man who discovered that the formation inside the underground chamber had vanished.

The old man was a close friend of the Tan Clan, so he should be familiar with their affairs.

It turned out that Chu Feng had left a mark on the old man, but Zi Ling didn’t even notice it.

Weng!

Chu Feng raised his arm, and the formation in his hand fell from the sky like a giant bell, trapping the old man in place. The old man found his surroundings shrouded in a fog.

Chu Feng stepped into the old man’s line of sight, but he had altered his appearance.

“Milord, you are?” The old man looked at Chu Feng, but he didn’t recognize the latter. Nevertheless, he could tell that Chu Feng was stronger than him.

“You’re in close ties with the Tan Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

The old man quickly bowed and replied, “Listen to me, milord. I’m just acquaintances with the Tan Clan. We aren’t that close at all!”

He was terrified, thinking that Chu Feng was the culprit who massacred the Tan Clan.

“Calm down. I had ties with the Tan Clan too, just that I don’t know much about them. I wish to avenge the Tan Clan, but I need to gather more information first,” Chu Feng replied.

The old man heaved a sigh of relief. “Milord, what do you want to know?”

“Did something happen to the Tan Clan two hundred years ago?” Chu Feng asked.
