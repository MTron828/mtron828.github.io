Chapter 5101: Departure

“My master?”

Chu Feng was baffled. Wasn’t his master kidnapped by Sima Xiangtu?

He took the envelope from Xian Miaomiao’s hand and opened it. He realized that there was no letter inside, but there was a surge of energy that seeped into his head. That was the real letter from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Chu Feng, I would have already left the Eastern Region by the time you received this letter. I have spent a long time thinking about it before I decided to tell you the truth.

“I wasn’t kidnapped by Sima Xiangtu. Rather, I chose to follow him on my own accord. I have already killed him, so you don’t need to worry about my safety or the possibility of Sima Xiangtu making a comeback.

“By this point, you should be aware that I’m not as weak as I appear. Of course, I wouldn’t be qualified to be your master if I was really that weak. Don’t blame me for deceiving you or not clearing away the thorns on your path. I chose not to make a move because I wanted to stimulate your potential. This is the only way you can speed up your growth. You didn’t disappoint me. I am heartened by what you have accomplished. As expected of my disciple.

“While Sima Xiangtu is dead, his disciple, Prince Brightsun of the Asura World Spirit Army, is still out on the loose. He possesses a powerful bloodline that surpasses the comprehension of even his own father. He harbors a deep hatred for you, so it’s inevitable that he’ll attempt to exact vengeance on you. You must tread carefully.

“You might be sharp-witted, but you value relationships too much. That’s your greatest weakness. I know that I won’t be able to change you, so you do you. That being said, you need to at least ensure your own safety at all costs. As long as you continue growing, there’ll come a day when we’ll be able to reunite with each other. That’s why you must survive. Also, don’t forget about your Immemorial Cosmos Map. I’m still holding onto it for you.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t say much, but his words left Chu Feng feeling deeply relieved.

He could tell that this letter was indeed from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, and he was surprised that his master had actually been hiding his true strength. That explained why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist felt unfathomable to him even after he had reached Martial Exalted level.

He felt relieved not because he had a powerful backing now but that Sima Xiangtu was dead and his master wasn’t in danger anymore. That had been a thorn in his heart all this while.

It was a surprise to hear that Prince Brightsun was Sima Xiangtu’s disciple, but he didn’t think that it was a big deal since he had the Asura World Spirit Army under his command now. Prince Brightsun was unlikely to be able to pose a threat to him at the moment.

“What a bright smile you have on your face. Chu Feng, what did your master say?” Xian Miaomiao asked curiously.

“I shan’t tell you, but it’s something good.”

Chu Feng chose to keep her in suspense as he slipped the envelope into his robe. The envelope was nothing but an empty accessory now that he had received the letter, but he decided to keep it anyway since it was from his master.

“Petty,” Xian Miaomiao grumbled with a pout.

“I can tell you, but only if you tell me why my master’s letter was in your master’s hand. Do the two of them know each other?” Chu Feng asked.

“They are old acquaintances, but I don’t know anything else other than that,” Xian Miaomiao replied.

“What else did your master say?” Chu Feng asked.

“My master said that you can ask the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief if you wish to know who he is. He requests for you not to make a big fuss out of it; it’ll suffice for you to know,” Xian MIaomiao said.

“Got it.”

Chu Feng stared at Xian Miaomiao as he suddenly sensed something.

“Miaomiao, are you going to leave now?” he asked.

“Mm. I’m going to leave with my master in a moment’s time…” Xian Miaomiao replied.

“Oh… Aren’t you going to bid your mother farewell? She has been worried about you,” Chu Feng said.

“My master only allowed me to bid you farewell. You’ll have to talk to her on my behalf. Just tell her that I’m fine and I found myself a master. That’ll suffice. My master doesn’t allow me to tell her anything else,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Alright. Help me thank your master,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng,” Xian Miaomiao suddenly called out with a serious tone.

“What’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked.

Xian Miaomiao hesitated for a moment, but she eventually showed a bright smile.

“Let me hug you.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xian Miaomiao walked up to Chu Feng. Chu Feng opened his arms wide and pulled her into a hug.

“Miaomiao, you must take care of yourself,” Chu Feng said.

“I might suffer a bit with my master, but I won’t be in any danger. The one who needs to take care of himself is you. You aren’t a child anymore, so you need to stop being so reckless,” Xian Miaomiao said.

Chu Feng smiled upon hearing those words.

Indeed, they weren’t children anymore even though they were still juniors.

Weng!

A spirit formation gate suddenly appeared behind Xian Miaomiao.

“It looks like your master is rushing you,” Chu Feng said.

“Seems so. I’ll be leaving then, Chu Feng. You need to work hard. My master is pretty formidable, so I might just leave you in the lurch. Take care of yourself.”

With those words, Xian Miaomiao stepped away from Chu Feng and started walking toward the spirit formation gate. Even though she turned away quickly, Chu Feng still noticed tears in her eyes.

She had intentionally turned around in hopes that he wouldn’t see her tears.

Chu Feng felt a little sorrowful about their separation too since he valued Xian Miaomiao a lot.

“Speaking of which, Miaomiao,” Chu Feng suddenly shouted. “How do you intend to deal with the Nine Souls Sacred Clan? Tell me and I’ll settle it for you.”

“My mother and I are fine, so let’s let bygones be bygones. Chu Feng, you don’t need to worry about me,” Xian MIaomiao said before stepping into the spirit formation gate.

The spirit formation gate swiftly disappeared behind her. At the same time, the pillar of light enveloping the sleeping chamber vanished.

The members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan quickly rushed in, and they were surprised to see that Chu Feng and Princess Xiaoxiao were unharmed. It was different from what they had expected.

Coincidentally, Princess Xiaoxiao roused from her sleep then.

“Chu Feng, what brings you all here?”

She was astounded by the crowd in her palace.

Chu Feng quickly filled the crowd in on the details, but he only said that a passing expert had helped Xian Miaomiao and taken her in as his disciple. As for the rest, he knew nothing at all.

It sounded unbelievable, but the crowd still believed it since it was coming from Chu Feng.

“My body?”

Princess Xiaoxiao inspected her own body, and her expression soon turned complicated.

“What’s wrong, Your Highness?”

The crowd from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan asked nervously.

“My illness. It’s gone,” Princess Xiaoxiao replied incredulously.
