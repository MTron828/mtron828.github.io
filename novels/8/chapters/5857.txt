Chapter 5858: The Praying Mantis Prey on the Cicada, Not Knowing the Oriole is Behind

“Damn it! It’s the fault of Puppeteer Exalted. We would have easily curbed her if we hadn't exhausted ourselves channeling his goddamned formation!” the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief spat with gritted teeth.

“Stop talking and kill her, or else the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect is going to disappear,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master said,

Uwa!

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master suddenly froze up. A white dagger covered in glowing blue runes had been plunged into his chest from behind.

The fight abruptly screeched to a halt.

It turned out that the fighting seven each had a white dagger plunged into their chests. Even the woman in a white dress wasn’t spared from it, and she, too, was taken aback.

This wasn’t any of their doing. Someone else had assaulted them.

Weng!

While the crowd was confused as to what was going on, a spirit formation gate opened. A white-robed person stepped out. He wore a spirit formation cloak covered in blue runes that resembled those on the white dagger.

He was the culprit who attacked them.

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders wanted to make a move on him, but they found themselves unable to move at all.

“There’s a binding formation in the dagger,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master said.

The white-robed man turned his eyes toward the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city and began constructing a formation.

“Who’s that?”

“I don’t know. How can I recognize him when he’s covered from head to toe?”

“Regardless, he has to be a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to simultaneously suppress seven Heavenly God level cultivators.”

The spectators were more concerned about the white-robed man’s background, whether he was from the Ancient Era or the present era.

Of course, they hoped that the latter was from the present era as those from the Ancient Era were simply too powerful. Other than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, the remaining galaxy overlords of the present era were still at pinnacle True God level. They were currently lagging behind the Ancient Era’s clans.

As a present-era cultivator, that was not something they hoped to see.

Pu!

Pu!

Pu!

Blood suddenly splattered all around. Those who were still chatting a moment ago exploded into bits. Those who had chosen to stay behind and watch the spectacle had been killed.

The white-robed man was channeling a strong surge of energy toward the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. The energy was so strong that it surpassed that of the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders and the white-robed woman. Even a whiff of it that leaked out was enough to kill all of the spectating cultivators in the distance.

“Young friend, it looks like you have been biding your time, waiting for an opportunity to swoop in and benefit from their labor. Little did you know that there’s still us.”

Another six figures appeared on the scene. They were incredibly old, so much so that there were no more than a hundred strands of hair on their heads. Their skin was wrinkly as if they had been folded many times. They were dressed in the clothes of the six Ancient Era’s clans.

“Lord Grand Elders!”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders were surprised to see the six elders, but their presence greatly reassured them. Despite being powerhouses, at this moment, they looked like a bunch of children whose parents had arrived on the scene to support them.

Clearly, they didn’t know that their clans’ grand elders had come too.

“Ancient things, I shall retreat for today, but let it be known that I’ll take back whatever that belongs to our era,” the white-robed man spoke with an altered, hoarse voice.

A spirit formation gate appeared in front of him, and he stepped into it.

“Trying to escape?”

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder raised his hand and released a sealing formation that sealed off the surrounding space, but moments later, he frowned.

“Did you capture him?” the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s grand elder asked.

“I didn’t. He has a strong teleportation treasure,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder replied.

“It doesn’t matter. The important thing is that the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city is still here.”

The six grand elders flitted toward the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, only to pass right through it. It turned out that what they saw before them was just an illusion.

“What’s going on?”

The five grand elders turned to the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder. He boasted the greatest knowledge in formations among them.

“It hasn’t fully manifested yet,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder replied.

“Milords, I have a way. You can make it fully manifest through my formation core,” the bound Puppeteer Exalted said.

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder flitted over to Puppeteer Exalted and removed the sealing formation from him. At the same time, the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s grand elder removed the black dagger from the bodies of the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders.

Shockingly, the black daggers morphed into slaughter formations and released massive explosions upon being pulled out. Fortunately, the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder noticed it in advance and constructed a sealing formation to seal off the explosions.

“Be careful. Don’t look down on the present-era world spiritists,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder said.

“The present-day world spiritists are despicable,” the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s grand elder remarked as he looked at Puppeteer Exalted, expressing his distrust in the latter. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A killing intent suddenly flared. The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s grand elder wanted to kill the woman in a white dress.

Puppeteer Exalted hurriedly said, “Milord, please spare them. They still have value. They are important pieces for us to manifest the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect.”

“Puppeteer Exalted, you deserve to die for withholding the truth from us,” the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s grand elder said.

“I know, I know. That’s why I’m making up for it now,” Puppeteer Exalted replied with a grin.

“Cut the crap. Hurry up and stabilize the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. If it disappears, I’ll take your life,” the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s grand elder sneered.

“All right, all right. I’ll do it now.”

Puppeteer Exalted first constructed a huge formation. With a wave of his sleeves, he took out a spherical formation, which swiftly expanded and enveloped the woman in a white dress and the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. He tossed the spherical formation along with the two women into the formation core.

He then stepped into the formation core himself and began channeling the huge formation.

The huge formation lit up. A ray of light shot out and fell on the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city. This stabilized the fading city.

However, the woman in a white dress and the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster let out pained groans despite being unconscious. Their life force was visibly slipping away from them, and they would soon die at this rate.
