Chapter 4930: The Empty Throne

“Young friend Chu Feng, you lack understanding of this place. I’ve heard about your affairs, and I know that you’re a prodigy with formidable means. Be it in terms of martial cultivation or spirit power, you can’t be compared to those of your generation. However, this place is extremely dangerous.&nbsp;

“If you do clear the trial and meet Princess Xiaoxiao, you must make sure to listen to her words. Otherwise, if you get yourself involved in trouble, Daoist Niantian and I might not necessarily be able to save you even with our combined efforts,” Master Yin Ren said.

Chu Feng glanced at Master Yin Ren before entering the spirit formation gate without saying a word.

He was immediately swept away by a whirlwind the moment he passed through the spirit formation gate. It was so powerful that he felt like countless blades of wind were sweeping around him. He was only able to withstand the impact due to his high cultivation.

Had it been anyone beneath Martial Exalted level, they would have been torn to shreds right away.&nbsp;

As powerful as the whirlwind was, Chu Feng was still able to quickly stabilize himself.&nbsp;

The whirlwind was coming from a formation, so there was naturally a way to decipher it. Chu Feng swiftly found an opening, allowing him to stand unfazed amidst the whirlwind.&nbsp;

It was just that the area of the whirlwind was so huge that it covered the entire world. To make things worse, there was more than a single whirlwind around.&nbsp;

They were pressing against each other, but their might differed. Some of them were so powerful that even Chu Feng would be immediately torn into shreds if he carelessly entered them.

While he had managed to get a footing in this foreign land, he would still have to tread carefully if he didn’t want to lose his life.

He had to make sure to pass through only the whirlwinds he could withstand. If he were to make even the slightest judgment error, it could potentially spell his end. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

So, he activated Heaven’s Eye, which allowed him to discern his surroundings and uncover some openings. Given enough time, he should be able to find an absolutely safe path through Heaven's Eye.

It was just that he didn’t want to waste any time. He was in a rush right now.

He could tell from the formation outside that Princess Xiaoxiao was trapped somewhere inside this hidden realm, and it was likely that she was facing grave danger. If Princess Xiaoxiao were to lose her life, Xian Miaomiao would die together with her.&nbsp;

That was the reason why Chu Feng insisted on entering the spirit formation gate. He wanted to save Princess Xiaoxiao as soon as possible so as to avoid any risks.&nbsp;

For this reason, he chose to take out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk pointed out a direction to Chu Feng right away. On top of that, it was pulsating with great power, suggesting that it was willing to lend him a helping hand for this matter.&nbsp;

“You’re finally willing to help me.”

Chu Feng felt a sliver of relief.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk was a powerful treasure that he had been wanting to control for a long time now. It was just that it was incredibly unstable, choosing only to offer him help at certain times.&nbsp;

It was truly fortunate that the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk was on his side this time around.

Under the guidance of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, he was able to pass through this field of whirlwinds with ease. It didn’t take him long to spot Princess Xiaoxiao’s figure.

Just as he had expected, she was trapped in the midst of a particularly dangerous whirlwind. There was a formation wrapped around her that warded off the destructive might of the whirlwind, allowing her to hold on for the time being.

This formation was likely to be the one activated by Master Yin Ren.

The current Princess Xiaoxiao wasn’t dressed as the male Yu Xiao but the woman whom Chu Feng had unintentionally stumbled upon back then. Putting all things aside, she was truly a gorgeous woman.

Her cold and reticent disposition was exceptionally attractive. Even in times of danger, she kept her absolute calm and assessed her surroundings rationally, trying to find a way out.&nbsp;

However, she suddenly jerked to a halt. She had finally caught sight of Chu Feng.

It was at that very moment that her composure broke.

Unease and guilt could be seen on her face.&nbsp;

Due to her intense fluctuation in emotions, even the barrier around her ended up weakening.

Hu!

The whirlwind around her exploited the opportunity and attacked her with even greater fervor. The weakened barrier around her struggled to hold on against the assault.&nbsp;

Seeing this, Princess Xiaoxiao quickly attempted to stabilize the barrier, but it was already too late. It was going to shatter at this rate, and she would lose her life as a result.&nbsp;

It was all due to Chu Feng’s presence distracting her, resulting in an error in her control.

Seeing that things were taking a bad turn, Chu Feng quickly activated the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. A powerful surge of spirit power rushed through the whirlwind and wrapped itself around Princess Xiaoxiao like a rope.&nbsp;

With a tug, Chu Feng pulled Princess Xiaoxiao out of the whirlwind and over to his side.

“Chu Feng, what… are you doing here? Could it be…”

Princess Xiaoxiao looked at Chu Feng hesitantly before lowering her head. She felt guilt-ridden, and that was why she dared not to face him.

“Is Miaomiao still alive?”&nbsp;

Chu Feng got straight to the point.

“You should be able to feel it yourself.”

Princess Xiaoxiao stretched her right hand forward and pulled up her sleeves, revealing her fair arm. Chu Feng placed his finger on her pulse and directed his spirit power in. He was able to clearly discern her condition due to Princess Xiaoxiao not hindering the flow of his spirit energy at all.

There was a formation in Princess Xiaoxiao’s soul that imprisoned a soul. It was Xian Miaomiao’s soul.&nbsp;

Xian Miaomiao’s soul was lying unconscious inside the prison, but it appeared to be unharmed. This meant that she was indeed still alive.

Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief, but at the same time, his heart also grew a little heavy.&nbsp;

As Princess Xiaoxiao hadn’t put up any defenses, he also noticed that the devastated state her soul was in. Just as he had heard from others, she was indeed terminally ill. This illness would claim her life if not treated, but Chu Feng couldn’t think of a single way to resolve her condition at all.&nbsp;

This left him with a heavy feeling in his heart.&nbsp;

If he were to save Xian Miaomiao, what would become of Princess Xiaoxiao?

It was only a matter of time before she succumbed to the illness.

“Regardless of the circumstances, what you did isn’t right. How could you harm others just to sustain your own life?” Chu Feng criticized her.&nbsp;

“Would you believe me if I say that I was forced into this? If I was truly a willing party, I could have assimilated Miaomiao’s soul by now and recovered from my illness,” Princess Xioaxiao said.&nbsp;

Her eyes were filled with so much indignation that Chu Feng was forced to avert his eyes.&nbsp;

To be honest, he knew that he wasn’t in a position to criticize her. The world of cultivation was a place where the strong thrived. No one was necessarily morally superior to others; everyone was just doing what they could to survive.&nbsp;

“Did you come here for the secret skill?” Chu Feng asked.&nbsp;

“It isn’t just that. There’s something important I need to take from here too,” Princess Xiaoxiao replied.

“Something important?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes. Master Yin Ren needs it,” Princess Xiaoxiao replied.

“Let’s go then.”

Chu Feng led the way forward. With the power of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, he was able to pass through the whirlwinds without any fear. It didn’t take them long to arrive at a spirit formation gate.

The two of them passed through the spirit formation gate and entered a vast palace. This palace was massive; just the ceiling was over a hundred thousand meters above them!

An ordinary mortal would have thought that this was a world in itself.&nbsp;

At the heart of the palace was a massive throne that towered at over a thousand meters. It was forged out of gold, giving it a magnificent and domineering aura. It was just that the throne was empty.

“How could this be?”

Princess Xiaoxiao was shocked.

“Is there something wrong?” Chu Feng asked.

“The secret skill should have been on the throne,” Princess Xiaoxiao said as she unrolled a painting that emanated the aura of the Ancient Era.&nbsp;

The painting depicted the palace they were in, just that there was an armored sculpture with a beast head sitting on the throne. The sculpture was the secret skill.&nbsp;

However, the sculpture was nowhere to be seen at all.

Chu Feng quickly activated the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, hoping to check if the secret art had been hidden.&nbsp;

Ssss!

A frown formed on his face.&nbsp;

Chu Feng realized that the secret skill had been taken away… and to make things worse, it was taken away not too long ago.&nbsp;
