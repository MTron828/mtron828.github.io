Chapter 2182 - Massacring The City

With merely a single strike, the two Family Heads’ bodies were hacked in two from the blazing slash.

The two bodies were destroyed. However, the two Family Heads were not actually dead. Instead, they turned into two spirit bodies and flew to escape.

However, Chu Feng spread open his hand, and a boundless attractive force spread forth.

The two spirit bodies were rapidly sucked toward Chu Feng’s palm. Furthermore, they were rapidly decreasing in size. Finally, like two rats, they were being firmly held by Chu Feng.

At this moment, the two Family Heads were struggling nonstop. However, they were simply unable to escape Chu Feng’s grasp. This caused their faces to be filled with panic.

“Tang Family’s Family Head, when you decided to kick your benefactor in the teeth and attack me that day, did you think that you would see this day?” Chu Feng asked with a cold voice. Dense killing intent emerged in his eyes.

“Little friend Chu Feng, please spare me, please spare me. Please take Lil’ Ying into consideration and spare my life,” The Tang Family’s Family Head began to beg Chu Feng for forgiveness nonstop.

“You still have the nerve to mention Tang Ying to me?” Upon hearing him mention Tang Ying, the killing intent in Chu Feng’s eyes increased instead of decreasing.

“Elder Yuan Zhen! Elder Yuan Zhen, save me!!!” Sensing that the situation was amiss, the Tang Family’s Family Head immediately turned to plea Elder Yuan Zhen for help.

“Today, no one will be able to save you.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he clenched his fist. “Puchi,” Tang Haichuan and Cao Kuofeng’s spirit bodies were smashed to pieces. They had been utterly killed.

Seeing this scene, many of the surrounding people were startled. None of them expected Chu Feng to be this powerful, for him to be able to easily kill the two Family Heads.

“So you were hiding your cultivation.”

At this moment, Elder Yuan Zhen’s eyes were shining. He had noticed that Chu Feng’s cultivation was that of a rank four Half Martial Ancestor after activating his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings. However, he had clearly only been a rank three Half Martial Ancestor earlier. This made him realize that Chu Feng had deliberately hidden his cultivation earlier, that he had intentionally let the two Family Heads become careless.

“You only realized that I had concealed my cultivation now? I’m afraid that it’s already too late,” Chu Feng smiled coldly. Then, he swept his gaze over his surroundings and said to the people present, “Today, I, Chu Feng, will massacre this city. Those of you who are unrelated to this, leave immediately.”

Once Chu Feng finished saying those words, surging killing intent sprang forth. The boundless killing intent flowed into the air and turned into black clouds that filled the sky. The black clouds resembled savage ferocious beasts that galloped in the sky. Their frightening aura filled the region.

“Run away!”

Sensing the killing intent and seeing Chu Feng’s abilities, the crowd all realized that Chu Feng was not joking around. Thus, many people began to soar into the sky and fly far away to escape this place. They were deeply afraid that they would be implicated in the battle that was about to take place.

After all, the attacks the Tang and Cao Family Heads had unleashed at Chu Feng earlier had already killed many innocent bystanders.

Although the people had escaped from the Cao Family, they had not actually escaped from the city. After all, they were all curious, and fond of watching lively excitements.

Although this lively excitement could not be viewed from nearby, these people felt that they must still view it from afar.

“People of the Tang and Cao Families, listen up. If you all wish to get away, you can still do so right now.”

“Else, do not blame me, Chu Feng, for being ruthless later. If you must blame someone... you all can only blame yourselves. I have given you all the chance to escape, it is only you all that refused to take it,” Chu Feng said coldly. There was not the slightest trace of emotion in his words.

“You have killed our Family’s Family Head, we will definitely not leave the matter at that. Chu Feng, we will take your dog life!”

“Chu Feng, you son of a bitch, you damned animal, I will dismember your body to ten thousand pieces, I will destroy you!”

“Chu Feng, I will excavate your ancestral tomb and kill all of your descendants! I will end your family line!!!”

As the Family Heads of the Tang and Cao Families had just been killed by Chu Feng, the people from both families were filled with fury. As such, how could they be afraid of Chu Feng? Many among them were pointing their fingers at Chu Feng as they rained curses upon him. Their curses were more and more vulgar and offensive.

“Boom~~~”

Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly waved his sword. Immediately, a slash swept through the void and landed on a group of people that were cursing at him.

Immediately, as the blazing slash flew past, blood sprayed in all directions. The people that were cursing at him earlier were all killed by Chu Feng. Not a single person survived his attack.

“Truly, you are people who refuse the face that is given to you,” After killing those people, Chu Feng snorted coldly. He did not feel the slightest sympathy for them.

Although Chu Feng was not a cold-blooded murderer, he was not a overly-sensitive individual either. He would give people a choice before killing them. However, if his opponents refused to escape, Chu Feng would definitely not spare them.

At this moment, even though there were still a lot of people from the Tang and Cao Families that felt endless hatred for Chu Feng, they were also afraid of Chu Feng after seeing how he had massacred so many of their clansmen. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At this moment, the countless people from the Tang and Cao Families present all turned mute. Very few among them dare to insult Chu Feng again.

In fact, many of them were shivering from fear. Before, they had yet to discover, had yet to realize, that this gentleman-like young man was actually a cold-blooded demon.

His declaration of massacring this city seemed to not be just a farce.

“Chu Feng, did you really think that you would be able to kill everyone present just because you were able to kill Tang Haichuan and Cao Kuofeng?” Elder Yuan Zhen asked with a cold, mocking laugh.

Although Chu Feng had unleashed his overwhelming might earlier, Elder Yuan Zhen still felt Chu Feng to be nothing than a joke.

“I, Chu Feng, am always one who can do what I say. I declared that day that if I, Chu Feng, survived, I would definitely eliminate the Tang and Cao Families,” Chu Feng said.

“Ignorant fool who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. While you can behave atrociously toward the Cao and Tang Families, our Luyang’s Pavilion will not allow for it,” After Elder Yuan Zhen said those words, he flipped his wrist and revealed an Incomplete Ancestral Armament.

It was a giant blue ruler. It was a very good quality Incomplete Ancestral Armament. Compared to the Incomplete Ancestral Armaments that the two Family Heads had, it was much better.

There was no need to mention how powerful that weapon was. Once that weapon was unleashed, it immediately affected the weather with strong wind that moved the clouds.

“Roar~~~”

After the enormous blue ruler appeared, Elder Yuan Zhen tossed it toward the sky. A roar was heard, and then an enormous wave surged into the sky. The wave began to spiral in the sky. Soon, it turned into an enormous water beast.

That monster resembled a giant turtle. However, its size was truly enormous; it was as if it could support both the heavens and the earth. As it lay horizontally in the sky, it was like a Divine Beast had descended upon the world.

“Roar~~~”

Suddenly, that enormous water beast opened its mouth and shot out a stream of water toward Chu Feng. The might of that attack was very powerful.

“Buzz, buzz, buzz~~~”

Seemingly sensing the provocation of that Incomplete Ancestral Armament, the Magma Emperor Sword Chu Feng held in his hand actually began to tremble nonstop.

That was right, it was trembling in excitement to battle. It was impatient to fight against that enormous water beast. It was as if the Magma Emperor Sword was unwilling to allow two tigers to live on the same mountain.

“Go ahead, Magma Emperor.”

Seeing that, Chu Feng lightly tossed the Magma Emperor Sword. “Boom!” The Magma Emperor appeared.

“You dare to hoot before this Emperor? Today, this Emperor shall teach you a proper lesson, you damned turtle bastard.”

The Magma Emperor was like an unchained fierce tiger. It was extremely ferocious, and managed to actually split apart the ferocious stream of water with its body. Then, it began to attack that enormous water beast.

That enormous water beast was not to be outdone. It opened its mouth and began to bite at the Magma Emperor. At the same time, it used its claws to claw at the Magma Emperor.

At this moment, two huge monsters were fighting in the sky. As water and fire were incompatible with one another, the two huge monsters were fighting to determine a victor and loser.
