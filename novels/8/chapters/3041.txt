Chapter 3041 - Unexpected Harvest

“I’ll know if it really is the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector once I test it out,” As Chu Feng spoke, he casually picked up a random ax from the treasury. That ax was no ordinary ax. Instead, it was an Immortal Armament.

Although the quality of that Immortal Armament was very average, it was still an actual Immortal Armament. Unless one possessed the cultivation of Martial Immortal, it would normally be impossible for one to use an Immortal Armament.

In fact, when Chu Feng held the Immortal Armament with his left hand, he was indeed unable to unleash the power of that Immortal Armament.

In fact, when he tried to unleash the power of the Immortal Armament, he felt a power of rejection coming from the Immortal Armament.

It was as if the Immortal Armament was reminding Chu Feng that he could not use it.

However, when Chu Feng tossed the Immortal Armament to his right hand and attempted to unleash its power again, the copper bracelet on his wrist started to emit a blue light. To be precise, it was the symbols on that bracelet that were emitting the blue light.

Chu Feng was able to feel that an enormous power from within the bracelet was currently entering the Immortal Armament.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, the entire treasury started to tremble violently. An enormous power was unleashed from the ax.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s battle power increased. Even though he was clearly a rank four Heavenly Immortal, he now possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation. In other words, the current Chu Feng was capable of contending against rank five Heavenly Immortals.

“Wow! It really is the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector! You’ve picked up a treasure, you’ve truly picked up a treasure.”

“Haha. Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, you did not allow yourself to receive a beating in vain. You also did not put forth a show in vain. To pick up such a treasure, you have truly profited enormously this time,” Her Lady Queen was wild with joy. Her smile was very sweet.

“The only pity is that I am only able to unleash the true power of the Immortal Armament, and incapable of making it recognize me as its master. It would appear that I will have to rely on my own power in order to make Immortal Armaments recognize me as their master,” Chu Feng said.

“That doesn’t matter. It’s enough that you’re able to use their power. Oh, that’s right. Chu Feng, since it is effective for an ordinary Immortal Armament, what about a high quality Immortal Armament? What sort of power will they give you?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“My dear Eggy, we’re thinking the same thing. Let me give it a try,” Chu Feng smiled lightly, and then found a pretty decent quality Immortal Armament from the treasury.

However, upon trying it, Chu Feng felt depressed.

He was simply unable to use the power of that slightly better quality Immortal Armament.

After that, Chu Feng tried some more Immortal Armaments, and even tried the top quality Immortal Armaments he kept within his Cosmos Sack. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Unfortunately, the final result came as a disappointment to Chu Feng.

While it was true that the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector was capable of allowing Chu Feng to use Immortal Armaments at the Heavenly Immortal realm and gain a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation, he was only able to use ordinary Immortal Armaments, and was unable to use any Immortal Aramment of even the slightest better quality, much less the Immortal Archery Bow and the Blackflame Ghost Sword, Immortal Armaments that were considered to be kings among Immortal Armaments.

“It’s alright. Being able to use Immortal Armaments and gain a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation is sufficient,” Seeing Chu Feng feeling dispirited, Her Lady Queen began to comfort him.

“Mn, the reputation of that Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector is already well-justified. Having obtained this treasure, this trip has not been made in vain,” After saying those words, Chu Feng took out a Cosmos Sack and placed all of the treasures around him into it.

Although those treasures were not of much use to Chu Feng, they were still treasures of considerable value. Chu Feng would naturally gather them. Not only would he be able to sell them for decent prices, but they would also serve as decent gifts for his friends.

After Chu Feng gathered all of the treasures in the treasury, Chu Feng carefully inspected the treasury again. After determining that there were truly no other treasures left, Chu Feng left the treasury.

However, after Chu Feng left the treasury, Chu Feng discovered that the entrance of the treasury was changing. It began to decrease in size. Then, it turned into an oval stone.

That oval stone was no ordinary stone. Holding the oval stone in his hand, Chu Feng was actually able to sense the power of the entire hideout.

“Milady Queen, it would appear that I’ve picked up another treasure,” Chu Feng said as he looked at the oval stone in his hand.

“What sort of treasure? Are you talking about the stone that the treasury turned into?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“This stone is not simply something capable of storing treasures. It is also capable of controlling this entire hideout,” Chu Feng said.

“This hideout? In that case, that is truly a treasure,” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Her Lady Queen nodded in agreement.

The hideout was what truly protected the Bandit Beasts. It was so well concealed that not even an expert of Chu Youyuan’s cultivation was able to detect it.

Although it did not possess powerful offensive abilities, it was a definite refuge.

With such a treasure in hand, even if Chu Feng were to be under pursuit by people stronger than him, they would find it very difficult to capture him.

Afterwards, Chu Feng continued to carefully inspect the giant monster’s body. After confirming that there were no other treasures in the giant monster’s body, Chu Feng left it.

After Chu Feng walked out of the giant monster’s body, he discovered that Chu Youyuan, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were standing in the sky above it.

“Seniors, your injuries?” Chu Feng hurriedly walked up to them. Seeing the rosy complexion on Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi’s faces, Chu Feng guessed that Chu Youyuan should’ve healed their injuries completely.

“Chu Feng, thanks to this lord, we are fine now. You don’t have to worry about us anymore,” Ying Mingchao had an extremely grateful tone as he said those words.

He knew very well that if it wasn’t for their relationship with Chu Feng, an expert like Chu Youyuan would not pay attention to them.

After all, in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they were simply too weak.

“Lord Youyuan, thank you,” Chu Feng thanked Chu Youyuan.

“My, we are all family. Boy, if you continue to act like this, this old man will become unhappy,” Chu Youyuan said with a smile.

Chu Feng also smiled.

“How was it? How was your harvest?” Chu Youyuan asked.

“There are a lot of treasures. However, this is the most precious one,” Chu Feng raised his right hand.

“That is the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector?” Chu Youyuan asked. The reason why he asked that was because Chu Feng was clearly wearing a bracelet.

“Lord Youyuan, I’ve already tried it out. This is indeed the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector,” Chu Feng said.

“Good, very good. Boy, you are truly a man of great fortune. You’ve actually managed to obtain a treasure that has been lost for so many years,” Chu Youyuan was very happy.
