Chapter 5767: The Indignant Huangfu Shengyu

While their Immortal Sea Fish Clan was a part of that remnant expedition and obtained a share of the Immemorial Divine Water too, their father didn’t allow them to consume it. He thought that their cultivation was in its nascent stage, and it was too early for them to rely on external means.

They could consume the Immemorial Divine Water later when they reached a bottleneck.

“It’s lucky you didn’t consume it,” Chu Feng said.

“What makes you say that, big brother?” Little Fishy stared at Chu Feng in curiosity.

Chu Feng told her that Wang Qiang had gifted a bottle of Immemorial Divine Water to him, but he sensed that something was amiss while assimilating it. While it was just a gut feeling without concrete evidence, he still shared his conjecture with her.

Of course, he communicated with her via voice transmission, since it was clearly inappropriate for Wang Qiang to give something as valuable as the Immemorial Divine Water to him. He would be punished by the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion if they learned about this.

“To think there’s such a side to the Immemorial Divine Water! I’ll make sure to tell my father!” Little Fishy exclaimed.

“My little sister! Are you sure you’re my little sister? You’ve never been that excited to look for me before,” Xianhai Shaoyu’s voice echoed.

Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, Xian Miaomiao, Feng Ling, and the others also appeared at the same time.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Why would I look for you?” Little Fishy said with a pout.

“Haa, there’s no point doting on little sisters.” Xianhai Shaoyu shrugged in resignation.

Everyone was already used to the two of them, so they simply smiled at their interaction.

Upon seeing Long Chengyu, Chu Feng asked him if he had consumed the Immemorial Divine Water too. To his surprise, the Totem Dragon Clan hadn’t participated in that expedition, so they didn’t receive a share of the Immemorial Divine Water.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief tried to buy some of it for Long Chengyu, but none of the powers were willing to sell it.

Unlike Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy, Long Chengyu intended to consume it, but he was unable to get his hands on it for various reasons. It was truly a blessing in disguise.

Chu Feng proceeded to tell Long Chengyu about his discovery, and the latter was relieved to hear that.

“Thank heaven my father failed to secure any Immemorial Divine Water for me, or else I’d have lagged even more behind the others,” Long Chengyu remarked via voice transmission.

Amidst idle chatter, they made their way into the square. Their entrance caught the crowd’s notice, and it induced speculation about who was the one who sparked the commencement of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

Some guessed it was Xianhai Shaoyu. Some guessed Little Fishy. Some even guessed Chu Feng. However, the popular pick was still Huangfu Shengyu. After all, the five Huangfus were the ones to first talk about the assessment formation in the cultivation ground.

A few people stepped forward to ask Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy if they had been the ones to clear the assessment formation, but the two siblings replied that it wasn’t them. This further convinced the crowd that it was Huangfu Shengyu.

In contrast, not a single person asked Chu Feng if he was the one to clear the assessment formation.

The crowd’s opinion of Chu Feng changed after he defeated Huangfu Shengyu, and they conceded that Chu Feng was indeed a highly talented individual. In fact, many believed that Chu Feng was the likeliest person to claim the title of the strongest in this iteration of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. No one here stood a chance against a True God level world spirit, after all.

Even so, no one dared to get close to Chu Feng, due to his enmity with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. They didn’t dare to greet him, even via voice transmission, let alone ask him about this matter.

“Look, the Huangfus are here!”

Someone in the crowd noticed the five Huangfus entering the square. Shortly after, Liu Kuo arrived at the square too.

“Benefactors, you’re early,” Liu Kuo said with a smile.

“Master, who was the one who cleared the assessment formation?” someone in the crowd immediately asked.

“Benefactors, you still don’t know who did it?” Liu Kuo glanced at Chu Feng and asked, “Benefactor Chu Feng, aren’t you keeping too low of a profile?”

“Chu Feng? It’s actually Chu Feng?”

The crowd was stunned, but there was a tinge of joy and relief on their faces. The last thing they wanted here was for the Huangfu Heavenly Clan to outdo them and make light of the cultivators of the present era, but they, too, understood that the Huangfus were the likeliest to clear the assessment formation, since they were the ones to first mention its existence.

The knowledge that it was Chu Feng who cleared the assessment formation allowed them to raise their heads as cultivators of the present era. He had proven that they were no worse than the cultivators from the Ancient Era.

Some women looked at Chu Feng with seductive eyes. Many directed taunting gazes at Huangfu Shengyu and the others.

“If not for my young master’s hard work, Chu Feng would have never cleared that assessment formation so easily. Chu Feng, you got lucky!” Huangfu Jiangyao pointed at Chu Feng and said.

“Are you looking for a beating?” Little Fishy asked.

“I-I’m just speaking the truth!” Huangfu Jiangyao exclaimed.

Shoosh!

Just then, a surge of light descended from the sky, seeped into the ground, and formed a formation. The formation swiftly expanded, and everyone who was in the range of the formation quickly backed off.

Huangfu Shengyu was the one who had tossed out the formation. The crowd was worried that the formation was dangerous.

“Young master, you…” Huangfu Jiangyao and the others revealed conflicted expressions when they saw the formation.

The formation quickly manifested into an immense stone platform that spanned a huge area despite only being a meter in height. This stone platform was black in color, but it was covered in beautiful runes that resembled lightning. It was the same runes on the cloaks donned by the five Huangfus.

Clearly, this was a treasure from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan.

Huangfu Shengyu leaped onto the stone platform. A surge of energy swiftly flowed from the stone platform into his body, and his face warped in pain.

“What’s going on? What’s he doing?”

“Why does it look like he’s in pain?”

The crowd was confused. They couldn’t tell what was going on.

Huangfu Shengyu looked at Chu Feng with gritted teeth and said, “Chu Feng, come up if you possess the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline too.”

“Don’t go, Brother Chu Feng. He’s up to something,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Long Chengyu, Xian Miaomiao, Feng Ling, and the others also dissuaded him from heading over. They could tell that the formation was an incredible treasure, but they couldn’t tell what its purpose was. It could be dangerous to recklessly step on top of the stone platform.

“Big brother!” Little Fishy grabbed Chu Feng’s arm so as to stop him from heading over
