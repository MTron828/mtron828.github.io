Chapter 3854 - Acting Promptly

After pondering for some time, Chu Feng ultimately decided to join hands with the Mystic Cave Saints.

Even though the Mystic Cave Saints were very unreliable, and cooperating with them would be very dangerous, Chu Feng felt that they were indeed people that had a baseline.

It was as the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints had said, the eleven of them had a very good relationship.

Of course, the most important thing was that the Mystic Cave Saints had a map of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb. If that map was real, it would mean that they would gain a decisive opportunity over the All-heaven Sect.

That was the reason why Chu Feng had decided to take such a risk.

After making his decision, Chu Feng planned to go and find Yin Zhuanghong to bid her farewell.

When the welcoming banquet for the All-heaven Sect concluded, Chu Feng proceeded toward Yin Zhuanghong’s residence.

As the Holy Daughter of the Red-dress Holy Land, Yin Zhuanghong’s residence was remarkable.

Her residence encompassed an entire floating island.

That island was extremely large, and resembled an isolated world. Everything inside the isolated world belonged to Yin Zhuanghong.

As she possessed a very antisocial personality, she did not even have any servant girls on the island.

Thus, she was the only person living on the enormous island. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

To Chu Feng’s surprise, after he arrived at the island, he discovered the auras of two different people on the island.

Apart from Yin Zhuanghong, the other person was... Nangong Yifan.

“Why is this guy here?”

Chu Feng felt that Yin Zhuanghong actually greatly detested Nangong Yifan, and would not have invited him over as a guest unless there was some sort of ulterior motive.

Thus, Chu Feng immediately unleashed his Heaven’s Eyes with the intention to check things out.

With his Heaven’s Eyes activated, Chu Feng’s field of vision immediately increased many times over.

Even though he had only just set foot onto the island, he was able to clearly see everything on it.

As expected, Yin Zhuanghong and Nangong Yifan both appeared in Chu Feng’s field of vision.

Not only was Chu Feng able to see them, but he was also able to read what they were saying through the movement of their lips.

Yin Zhuanghong and Nangong Yifan were both standing outside a palace.

That palace was Yin Zhuanghong’s sleeping palace.

“Nangong Yifan, it is already late, exactly what are you planning to do by coming to my residence without my permission?”

“Leave immediately. Else, do not blame me for becoming impolite.”

Yin Zhuanghong had an ice-cold expression and anger in her eyes as she looked to Nangong Yifan.

Chu Feng gained a rough idea of what was happening from her words.

It turned out that Nangong Yifan had come to Yin Zhuanghong’s residence uninvited.

“Miss Yin, you know of my feelings for you. I only wish to ask you one thing today.”

“I, Nangong Yifan, wish to take you as my wife. Are you willing to marry me?”

“Should you be willing, I can give you anything you want as a betrothal gift. Just tell me what it is and I’ll get it for you.”

“Furthermore, I can guarantee that if you are willing to marry me, I will never take any concubines, and love only you for the rest of my life.”

Nangong Yifan was extremely emotional as he said those words.

That Nangong Yifan was normally very uncommunicative, and extremely proud. Never would Chu Feng have imagined that he would actually be so passionate when facing Yin Zhuanghong.

Chu Feng suspected that as long as she said she was willing, Nangong Yifan would even kneel without any hesitation.

“Nangong Yifan, it’s impossible for you and me.”

“Leave immediately. I am going to rest.”

After saying those words, Yin Zhuanghong turned around with the intention to enter her sleeping palace.

As for Nangong Yifan, he stood there shivering from anger.

Soon afterward, his expression changed completely. His gaze was like that of a crazed ferocious beast.

Nangong Yifan suddenly extended his hand and grabbed Yin Zhuanghong’s wrist.

“Let go of me.”

Yin Zhuanghong turned around. A look of anger filled her ice-cold gaze.

However, Nangong Yifan, who had always been obedient to Yin Zhanghong, did not listen to her this time around. Instead, he stared fiercely at her. “I know why you don’t want to marry me. It’s because there’s someone else in your heart.”

“Did you fall for that Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Chu Feng?”

“That Chu Feng is of low birth. Everything about me is superior to him.”

“Do you believe that I will call my men and extinguish his entire clan tomorrow?”

Nangong Yifan was extremely furious. His tone sounded somewhat crazed.

“I will say it again. Let go of me. Otherwise, I am going to be impolite with you.”

Yin Zhuanghong’s gaze turned even colder. She was not joking around.

“Impolite? I wish to see how you’re going to be impolite with me.”

“You damned bitch who refuses the face that is given to you. Today, I am going to make you mine.”

“After today, even if you want to marry me, I wouldn’t marry you. You’ll only be my plaything.”

Engulfed in rage, how could Nangong Yifan possibly listen to Yin Zhuanghong? As he spoke, he extended his other hand and grabbed her clothes.

Yin Zhuanghong immediately avoided his hand upon seeing that. However, the cuff of her sleeve was still grabbed by Nangong Yifan.

With a tear, one of Yin Zhuanghong’s sleeves was torn apart by Nangong Yifan, revealing her arm.

“Nangong Yifan, have you gone mad?”

“What sort of place did you take this to be? This is the Red-dress Holy Land!”

Yin Zhuanghong’s voice was trembling. Killing intent appeared in her beautiful eyes.

She was truly furious, and really wanted to kill Nangong Yifan.

Unfortunately, she could not. In fact, she did not dare to attack Nangong Yifan.

In reality, Yin Zhuanghong’s strength surpassed Nangong Yifan’s.

However, for some special reason, she had been concealing her cultivation.

Because of that special reason, even though Nangong Yifan had unleashed his beastial nature, Yin Zhuanghong was still exercising restraint, and not attacking him.

As for Nangong Yifan, he had already lost all sense of reasoning due to his anger.

After he saw Yin Zhuanghong’s fair-skinned, beautiful arm, he became even more crazed.

He leapt, and pounced toward Yin Zhuanghong.

“Scram!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.

Following that, Nangong Yifan, who had already leapt into the air, let out a scream and was sent flying.

The next moment, Nangong Yifan who had landed on the ground, had a stunned look. As for Yin Zhuanghong, she was also completely shocked.

The reason for that was because a figure had appeared between the two of them.

Naturally, that person was Chu Feng.
