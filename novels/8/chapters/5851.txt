Chapter 5852: Bestowment of Death

The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief fell silent. It dared not to look its clansmen in the eye, as it silently acknowledged the decision too. However, it still felt a tinge of reluctance, which prompted him to look at Chu Feng with a gentler look.

“Young friend Chu Feng, why does someone of your talent insist on opposing us, Ancient Era’s clans, over a bunch of weaklings? If you join hands with us, I promise you that we’ll only claim the treasure. We won’t hurt your people in the slightest. You’ll also get a share of the treasure too,” the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief offered.

It was offering the carrot since the stick didn’t work.

Those from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy felt their hearts leaping into their throats out of nervousness. Chu Feng was currently in control of their protective formation. With his means, it could destroy it with ease.

If Chu Feng accepted the other party’s offer, they would be doomed.

Chu Feng was a talent; he had value to the Ancient Era’s clans.

But what about the rest of them? What did they count as? In the end, they were mere ants. There was no doubt they would suffer if the Ancient Era’s clans got in.

However, Chu Feng ignored the words of the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and said, “It looks like you have made your decision.”

He glanced at the incense stick he held with his left hand. It had already burned out. Thus, he turned to Zhao Gongyi and the others and said, “Look, your clans have abandoned you.”

Some of the top prodigies lowered their heads and readied themselves for death. They would support their clans’ decision even at the expense of their life. However, Zhao Gongyi cried even louder, as he begged his clansmen to save him with tears and snot on his face. His screams were so desperate that his desire to live resonated through his words.

All of them had a bright future ahead of them. How could they be willing to die just like that?

Chu Feng clenched his hand around the formation blade. He raised his head and looked at the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief with murderous intent in his eyes.

The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief sensed Chu Feng’s desire to kill, and its face darkened. It roared, “Chu Feng, if you dare touch them, there’ll be no place for you in the vast world of cultivation. Everyone in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy will be buried together with you.”

Its saliva rained down on the protective formation, emanating an awful stench that could be smelled even on the other side. Its murderous intent flared like a raging storm.

However, Chu Feng flicked his wrist and swung the formation blade.

A cold gleam flashed across space, and the world fell silent.

All pleas had stopped. All the top juniors from the Ancient Era’s clans had been beheaded in a single swoop.

After the short silence was a furious tirade. The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief frenziedly smashed on the protective formation, roaring, “I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!!!!”

Chu Feng paid no heed to it. He stood up and looked at Old Man Compliance, and the two of them made their way toward the spirit formation gate. At the same time, he clenched his fist, and all of the treasures and origin energies of the top prodigies fell into his grasp.

That further enraged the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, but it didn’t continue on its rampage. Its massive hands fell helplessly to its sides, as it realized that it couldn’t intimidate Chu Feng with its threats.

The fact that Chu Feng dared to kill their top prodigies at all showed that he didn’t fear them.

...

Chu Feng and Old Man Compliance passed through the teleportation formation and headed to where the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and the others were.

A commotion broke out in the realm.

Duan Liufeng, Shengguang Buyu, Daoist Niantian, and the others quickly surrounded Chu Feng and Old Man Compliance. Some of them praised Old Man Compliance for hiding his true capabilities so thoroughly over the years, but most people had their attention on Chu Feng,

Old Man Compliance had contributed greatly too, but Chu Feng was the true hero in their eyes.

Even though the crisis wasn’t over yet, they still revealed heartened smiles upon seeing him. The junior whom they had to protect back then had returned stronger than ever to protect them. Seeing the person whom they had taken care of achieving something great filled them with a sense of exultation.

Their judgment was right. It was the most correct thing they had ever done.

Whoosh!

Clanging echoed from the distance. The crowd parted, as Shengguang Baimei dragged an old man over.

The old man was covered in severe injuries that significantly weakened him, but even so, his body was bound in chains. It was Shengguang Xuanye, the ex-Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief, as well as the ex-galaxy overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy.

Shengguang Xuanye had once seen Chu Feng as a threat and did everything he could to eliminate the latter. He was later imprisoned by the Holy Valley, though a close aide of his helped him to escape.

Chu Feng was surprised to see Shengguang Xuanye, especially the pitiful state he was in.

He had met Shengguang Xuanye together with Long Xiaoxiao in another galaxy.

Someone had insulted the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, which prompted Shengguang Xuanye to step forward and defend its honor. However, he was too weak and was nearly beaten to death. In the end, Chu Feng stepped forward and saved him.

Shengguang Xuanye burst into tears of regret when he saw how he was saved by the people whom he had hurt back then.

It was due to his devotion to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy that Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao decided to let the matter slip.

Long Xiaoxiao told him to return to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy and accept the Holy Valley’s punishment. Those words were mentioned casually, but Shengguang Xuanye did as he was told.

“Young friend Chu Feng, we have captured Shengguang Xuanye and punished him. His sentence isn’t over yet, but he wanted to do his part to protect the Holy Light Galaxy. Out of worry that he would escape, I bound him up with chains. Since you have returned, I’ll entrust him to you,” Shengguang Baimei said.

“You captured him? Where?” Chu Feng asked. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“He was sneaky. He had been hiding in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” Shengguang Baimei said.

Chu Feng immediately understood that Shengguang Xuanye had returned on his own accord to surrender. He turned to the latter and asked, “You didn’t tell them that you met me?”

Shengguang Xuanye lowered his head, not saying a word at all. He knew he had sinned, so he did not try to lighten his punishment.

“He... met you?” Shengguang Baimei and the others were stunned.

“I met him with Xiaoxiao while I was journeying in the other realms. Xiaoxiao told him that if he truly repented his actions, he should return and accept punishment,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah... This means he has long escaped from our Holy Light Galaxy, and he intentionally returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm so that we can capture him?”

The crowd widened their eyes in realization.
