Chapter 2580 - There’s No Path For Regret

“All members of Hero City, listen up. In the future, as long as they are friends of Chu Feng, the entrance to our Hero City will always be open to them,” Ying Mingchao said to the crowd.

Hearing those words, the crowd’s expression changed again.

As long as they were Chu Feng’s friends, they would be allowed to join or become Hero City’s allies. In other words, cultivations would be disregarded.

Hero City was a place that generally only accepted elites. What Ying Mingchao was doing was simply once again telling the crowd how important Chu Feng was to him.

Although Ying Mingchao’s actions had already gone against the rules of Hero City, and it could even be said that he was smashing apart his own reputation, no one dared to voice any word of objection.

In fact, no one felt that what Ying Mingchao did was a mistake.

Chu Feng had saved Ying Mingchao. If it weren’t for Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao might be trapped in the Kong Heavenly Clan for the rest of his life.

While it could be said that Chu Feng had saved Ying Mingchao’s life, it could also be said that Chu Feng had given Ying Mingchao a new lease on life.

With Ying Mingchao’s personality, for him to attach so much importance to Chu Feng was also completely reasonable.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment when Ying Mingchao was declaring the status that Chu Feng held in his heart, a figure quietly blended into the crowd.

As for that person, it was none other than the World Spiritist Saintess.

Although she had failed to reconcile with Chu Feng, she did not plan to give up on joining Hero City.

Merely, upon taking into consideration the relationship between Chu Feng and Ying Mingchao, she did not dare reveal herself when both Chu Feng and Ying Mingchao were present.

After all, if Chu Feng were to speak ill of her, who knew what Ying Mingchao might do?

However, what sort of cultivation did Ying Mingchao possess? He had already noticed the World Spiritist Saintess’s aura the moment she approached.

Furthermore, during the time Chu Feng was gone, Ying Mingchao had made a lot of inquiries regarding Chu Feng.

As such, Ying Mingchao knew to a greater or lesser degree who had helped Chu Feng before and who were Chu Feng’s enemies.

“Have you all caught what I’ve said earlier?” Ying Mingchao asked loudly.

“Yes, Milord,” Thunder-like voices resonated throughout the region. The members of Hero City did not dare to go against Ying Mingchao’s order.

“There’s another thing that you all must remember. Just like how Chu Feng’s friends are our Hero City’s friends, Chu Feng’s enemies are also our Hero City’s enemies. For example, her.”

As Ying Mingchao spoke, he suddenly extended his palm and grabbed the space before him.

“Wuuahh.”

The next moment, a scream was heard. Then, a figure flew from the crowd.

Following the movement of Ying Mingchao’s palm, that figure was raised from the ground and appeared before the crowd’s field of view.

“It’s actually the World Spiritist Saintess?”

The crowd were all greatly shocked. The reason for that was because none of them had detected the World Spiritist Saintess, as she had concealed herself.

Thus, they were all surprised by the sudden appearance of the World Spiritist Saintess. However, what they were more surprised by was the fact that Ying Mingchao actually attacked the World Spiritist Saintess directly.

Although they were all unable to feel Ying Mingchao’s oppressive might, they knew from the painful expression of the World Spiritist Saintess that she was currently enduring enormous pressure.

“City Master Ying, please spare me. City Master Ying, please spare me.”

The World Spiritist Saintess was struggling in midair with a painful expression on her face. Even the voice that she begged with was very weak.

Furthermore, her aura was growing weaker and weaker. Ying Mingchao’s oppressive might was currently entering her body. If it were to continue, she would sooner or later be crushed to death by Ying Mingchao’s oppressive might.

“Senior, just let her go. The things between her and I are things from the past. Just spare her today,” Chu Feng said.

“Since Brother Chu Feng has spoken, I will spare your life,” As Ying Mingchao spoke, he released his hand.

After Ying Mingchao released his grasp, the World Spiritist Saintess fell directly to the ground like a loose kite. She started to gasp for air, and began to cough nonstop.

Although Ying Mingchao had only held her for a short moment, the crowd were able to gain an even clearer realization as to how frightening Ying Mingchao was from how weak the World Spiritist Saintess appeared at that moment.

“Thank you, City Master Ying, for sparing my life. Thank you, Little Friend Chu Feng, for helping me plead for leniency.”

Even though she was already incomparably weak, the World Spiritist Saintess gave all her strength to get up from the ground to express her thanks to Ying Mingchao and Chu Feng nonstop.

Lingering fear filled her face. She herself knew best what Ying Mingchao did to her earlier.

Thus, she knew that she had taken a journey to the gates of hell, and nearly died in the process.

At that moment, she was extremely afraid. The reason for that was because she knew that if Ying Mingchao wanted to kill her, she could die at any moment.

Thus, rather than trying to escape right away, she felt that it would be better to resolve the hostility that Chu Feng and Ying Mingchao held toward her. Only with that would she be able to remain alive in a long-term manner.

“There’s no need to thank me. If you want to thank someone, thank Chu Feng,” Ying Mingchao spoke coldly.

“Little friend Chu Feng, thank you for being a person of great moral stature, and not remembering the offenses committed by this one of low moral stature. Thank you... thank you...” The World Spiritist Saintess hurriedly begged Chu Feng for forgiveness.

Although there was a very deep grievance between Chu Feng and the World Spiritist Saintess, Chu Feng did not particularly dislike the World Spiritist Saintess. At the very least, he had not reached a point where he would insist on taking her life.

The reason for that was because the World Spiritist Saintess had left behind a single good impression on Chu Feng.

No matter how she treated others, the World Spiritist Saintess was most definitely a caring and doting mother.

Chu Feng was emotionally moved by how far the World Spiritist Saintess was willing to go to protect the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

The greatness of maternal love had given Chu Feng a new recognition for the World Spiritist Saintess.

Thus, Chu Feng did not continue to make things difficult for the World Spiritist Saintess. Instead, he merely warned her, “I’ve said it already, the past is the past.”

“However, let me advise you this: it is best that you do more good deeds and fewer malicious deeds in the future.”

“If I am to hear that the World Spiritist Saintess has committed bloody atrocities again, then even without having senior Ying Mingchao do anything, I, Chu Feng, will personally not let you get away with it.”

“I wouldn’t dare, I most definitely wouldn’t dare. I will definitely do good deeds in the future,” The World Spiritist Saintess vowed.

“That’s enough. Leave now. Even if Brother Chu Feng has forgiven you, the entrance to our Hero City will definitely not open to you,” Ying Mingchao said impatiently while waving his hand.

He was disgusted with this World Spiritist Saintess from the bottom of his heart.

The World Spiritist Saintess was very tactful. After she finished guaranteeing her good behavior to Chu Feng, she immediately left.

“Little friends, I hope you all will forgive me for the negligence we’ve shown earlier.”

After the World Spiritist Saintess left, Ying Mingchao spoke to Liu Xiaoli with an apologetic expression.

“Lord City Master, you’re being too courteous. We... we were simply not neglected. We are already extremely delighted to be able to meet you.”

Liu Xiaoli and the others were reacting with overwhelming nervousness. It was as if they were seeing their idol. Even their speech started to stammer.

“I am truly delighted that you all do not blame me. I have already ordered my people to prepare a welcoming banquet. Let’s continue to chat inside the city,” Ying Mingchao said.

“A welcoming banquet? For us?” The expressions of Liu Xiaoli and the others changed enormously. They knew very well what sort of people they were. How could they possibly be qualified for Ying Mingchao to throw them a welcoming banquet? They were truly overwhelmed.

“Lord City Master, there’s no need for that. You are simply being too courteous. We...” Liu Xiaoli’s face had turned red.

“Since you all are already here, you’re guests. As guests, you should go with the decision of the host.”

Ying Mingchao laughed. Then, he waved his sleeve, and Chu Feng, Liu Xiaoli and the others all disappeared together with him.

Even without thinking, the crowd knew that they must’ve entered the city.

Although Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng and the others had left, the remaining crowd were still unable to calm themselves. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The attitude Ying Mingchao had toward the World Spiritist Saintess was simply a night and day difference when compared to the attitude he had toward Liu Xiaoli and the others.

Most importantly, the World Spiritist Saintess was, after all, an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, a top character in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

As for Liu Xiaoli and the others, none of them knew who they were. It could be said that they were only nameless nobodies in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Yet before the entrance of Hero City, that renowned World Spiritist Saintess had nearly died. In the end, she started to plead for mercy.

As for those nameless nobodies, they instead received enthusiastic treatment from Ying Mingchao.

Logically, something like that was simply impossible. Yet, it had happened.

“It would appear that there will only be two types of people in Hero City in the future.”

“One would be Chu Feng’s friends, whereas the other would be Chu Feng’s enemies.”

“As long as they’re Chu Feng’s friends, regardless of how weak their cultivation might be, they will be able to enjoy the treatment of honored guests.”

“However, if they’re Chu Feng’s enemy, regardless of how strong their cultivation might be, they will not be able to escape death.”

Suddenly, an old man from the crowd gasped in admiration repeatedly.

“Indeed. With Ying Mingchao as his backing, all those that have befriended Chu Feng before will enjoy great fortune.”

“As for those who have made an enemy out of Chu Feng, they are most likely in so much regret that even their intestines will have turned green.”

The others present were also gasping with admiration.

Life was a series of choices. With a single correct choice, one could ascend to heaven with a single step. With a single incorrect choice, one could fall into hell with a just one step.

All those that had chosen to befriend Chu Feng had all struck gold.

Those people would become the target of envy for all people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

As for those that had chosen to become Chu Feng’s enemies, they would be pitied by the people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

However, their paths were all chosen by themselves. As such, who could they possibly blame even if they now regretted it?
