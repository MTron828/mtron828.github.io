Chapter 4298 - Mysterious Organization

There were over three hundred people standing in the starry sky and staring at the terrifying lump of clouds.

They were all wearing the same attire -- a dark grey gown. Special sort of black vein lines filled the gowns.

If one pays close attention, one would notice that the black vein lines resemble lightning.

But, as those black colored vein lines was very similar in color to the dark grey colored gown, one would not notice them if one didn’t pay close attention.

Worthy of mentioning...

These people that were all standing orderly in midair, practically every single one of them were emitting an unfathomable aura.

Furthermore, every one of them was wearing hoods. Their hoods were joined to their gowns. Not only did the hoods cover their hair, it also covered half their face.

But, truth was, one could not clearly see their lower half of their faces not covered by the hoods either.

The reason for that was because they were all wearing masks, black colored masks.

Those masks were very strange looking. Not only did it cover their faces, it also covered their eyes.

But, their visions were not blocked by the masks at all.

“Woosh---”

Not long after, a figure flew over from the direction of the terrifying lump of clouds.

That person was wearing the same attire as this group of people. It was evident that the incoming individual belonged to the same group as these people.

After flying over, that person kneeled before the group of three hundred plus.

Turned out, even though this group of people were all emitting unfathomable auras, there was a disparity in status between them.

Among them, the two strongest individuals were standing at the foremost of the group.

These two people were most likely the group’s leaders.

If one didn’t pay extra close attention, one wouldn’t notice there to be any difference in their attire from the rest of the group.

But, paying close attention, one could notice that the black vein lines on their gowns were more concentrated.

But, different from the others, the two of them had revealed a small amount of their hair from under their hoods. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

One possessed white hair and the other possessed red hair.

“Milords, I’ve confirmed that it is two young men that are devouring that power.”

“One of them is the son of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief, Xianhai Shaoyu,” reported the man who flew over from the terrifying lump of clouds.

“So it really was Xianhai Shaoyu?”

Hearing Xianhai Shaoyu’s name, the crowd grew restless.

Subconsciously, they all turned their gazes to the white-haired person of the two leaders.

Even that red-haired leader also looked to the white-haired leader.

But, compared to the others, the white-haired leader was rather calm.

“Who’s the other youngster?” asked the white-haired leader.

“This subordinate is unaware.”

“But, he is likely not a young master of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan,” said the person kneeling before the group.

“You are certain that he’s not from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan?” asked the white-haired leader.

“This subordinate has never seen that man among the people from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan,” said the person kneeling on the ground.

“Continue to monitor,” said the white-haired leader.

“Yes, Milord.”

The person kneeling on the ground stood up and flew toward the terrifying lump of clouds again.

In a blink of an eye, he disappeared into the starry sky...

“Is it really the power that you spoke of?”

At this moment, the red-haired leader turned to ask the white-haired leader.

“There’s no mistake. Although it is the first time I see it too, that is most definitely that power.”

“The Immortal Sea Fish Clan has been searching for that treasure the entire time. They’ve finally found it now,” said the white-haired leader.

“The Immortal Sea Fish Clan has always been a conceited group of people. They would not cooperate with outsiders.”

“But, it seemed like the other youngster was not someone from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Who is he then?” Curiosity filled the voice of the red-haired leader.

“We don’t have to worry about that. After all, the two of them are both within our grasp,” said the white-haired leader.

“Xianhai Shaoyu is the successor to the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief.”

“Since he showed himself, there’s most definitely someone protecting him from the shadows. Are we really going to act?”

“Shouldn’t we return to seek help from Lord Clan Chief and others?” asked the red-haired leader.

“There wouldn’t be anyone protecting him from the shadows,” said the white-haired leader.

“Are you really certain about that?”

“If he is being protected, we’ll end up suffering miserably,” said the red-haired leader.

“Who else could know about the Immortal Sea Fish Clan better than me?” The white-haired leader looked to the red-haired leader.

Even though his face was hidden by a mask and one cannot see his eyes, the red-haired leader could sense his gaze as he was being stared at.

That white-haired leader’s gaze was filled with confidence.

“Indeed, very few people understand the Immortal Sea Fish Clan better than you,” The red-haired leader reached terms.

“Then we’ll proceed according to my plan,” said the white-haired leader.

......

Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu were joining hands to take on the terrifying power.

But, doing so was no easy task. If they were slightly careless, they would be in fatal danger.

But, with the great effort put forth by the two men, the terrifying power that enveloped an entire region in the starry sky were finally all absorbed into their bodies.

At this moment, Xianhai Shaoyu’s complexion was deathly pale and he was gasping for breath. His condition was extremely weak. He resembled someone on the verge of dying.

But, excitement filled his face.

“Finally, success. I, Xianhai Shaoyu, succeeded,” sighed Xianhai Shaoyu emotionally.

When he turned his gaze to Chu Feng, he had a look of concern and distress on his face but also a selfish look of joy.

No matter how weak Xianhai Shaoyu was, he was at least conscious.

Chu Feng, on the other hand, had lost consciousness...
