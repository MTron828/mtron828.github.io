Chapter 5755: Martial Power Formation

Huangfu Shangyang had simultaneously unleashed the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, raising his cultivation to rank nine Half-God level. The aura he emanated was even stronger than that of Huangfu Shangwu.

“He’s very focused. He has been closely observing Long Chengyu despite looking as if he didn't think much of the latter. The moment Long Chengyu raised his cultivation, he did the same and even found an opening to exploit.

“Long Chengyu thought he could turn the tables with a surprise attack, but the truth was that Huangfu Shangwu was in control of the battle from the very start. Long Chengyu lost not because he is weak, but because his opponent is stronger,” Xianhai Shaoyu told Chu Feng via voice transmission.

Chu Feng agreed with Xianhai Shaoyu’s analysis. Long Chengyu didn’t lose due to carelessness; Huangfu Shangyang was simply stronger.

“Damn it!”

Long Chengyu felt indignant. He tried his best to return to his feet, but the power of lightning had numbed his body. He was no longer able to fight.

Huangfu Shangyang glanced at Long Chengyu and sneered, “Do you understand how inferior your bloodline is compared to mine now?”

Chu Feng wanted to step into the dueling ring, but there could only be two people in the dueling ring at any given time due to its formation. As soon as Huangfu Shangyang stepped off the dueling ring, he rushed up to check on Long Chengyu before directing a glance toward Huangfu Shangyang.

Huangfu Shangyang noticed Chu Feng’s glance and responded with an eerie smile. Chu Feng ignored him and leaped off the dueling ring with Long Chengyu.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Brother Chu Feng, was I an embarrassment?” Long Chengyu asked softly.

“Victory and defeat are normal in battles. You just have to win it back the next time,” Chu Feng consoled him.

“True,” Long Chengyu replied with a chuckle. He wasn’t happy with the outcome, but he didn’t descend into self-reproach and instead said, “I have to say that those Huangfus are a force to be reckoned with. I’m indeed unable to match him.”

“They are strong,” Chu Feng agreed.

Huangfu Jiangyao stepped onto the dueling ring next.

Shoosh!

Another person stepped onto the dueling ring right after—it was Little Fishy.

“What are you doing? I didn’t say I was going to challenge you,” Huangfu Jiangyao said.

“Didn’t you say you were planning to challenge me?” Little Fishy asked.

“I-I changed my mind. I’ll challenge one of the world spiritists,” Huangfu Jiangyao replied.

“Tsk. How boring.” Little Fishy pouted in discontentment before leaping off the dueling ring.

“Huangfu Jiangyao, are you afraid?” the white-haired man asked.

“Young master, I’m not afraid. The others have been fighting cultivators, so I thought it’d be more interesting if I fought a world spiritist instead,” Huangfu Jiangyao explained.

“Don’t forget your identity. Don’t bring shame to our Huangfu Heavenly Clan,” the white-haired man warned.

Huangfu Jiangyao’s heart shuddered. He turned to the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and asked aloud, “Where’s Jie Tian?”

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion remained silent, but someone else from the crowd replied, “Jie Tian has already left the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.”

“He left?” Huangfu Jiangyao turned his eyes to Ling Xiao. “Ling Xiao, do you dare to fight me?”

Shoosh!

Ling Xiao leaped onto the dueling ring without any hesitation.

“This will be your reward if you defeat me,” Huangfu Jiangyao said as he whipped out a pearl harnessing strong spirit power.

“Can we begin now?” Ling Xiao coldly asked.

“Of course. I’ll be standing right here. Feel free to make a move whenever you like,” Huangfu Jiangyao replied with a mocking smile. He didn’t think much of Ling Xiao.

Boom boom boom!

Hundreds of formation flood dragons suddenly appeared all around Huangfu Jiangyao and assaulted him. These serpent dragons were comparable to rank eight Half-God level cultivators, which suggested that Ling Xiao was an Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist too.

Huangfu Jiangyao activated his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor, raising his cultivation to rank eight Half-God level in a heartbeat. Instead of dodging the serpent dragons, he stood his ground and unleashed his oppressive might with the intention of unraveling Ling Xiao’s formation.

The next moment, his face turned grave.

He failed to stop the flood dragon formation because Ling Xiao was hiding the true power of the flood dragon formation—it was actually on par with rank nine Half-God level cultivators.

Ling Xiao had a heaven-defying battle power of one cultivation rank.

Tzlala!

Lightning suddenly ravaged the surroundings, and the flood dragons disintegrated.

A pair of Lightning Wings had manifested behind Huangfu Jiangyao, further raising his cultivation to rank nine Half-God level.

“You’re not as weak as I thought you were,” Huangfu Jiangyao remarked.

Ling Xiao didn’t reply. He stood still on the spot, not forming any hand seals at all, as if this battle had nothing to do with him.

Yet, the dueling ring shook intensely as towering waves of water rose out of nowhere and crashed down on Huangfu Jiangyao one after another. This formation was much stronger than the one before.

“What incredible control of spirit power!” Chu Feng was impressed.

Huangfu Jiangyao had the advantage in terms of fighting power, but Ling Xiao was able to stand his ground through his outstanding ability to control his spirit power. As a result, the battle came to a standstill.

“As expected of Ling Xiao.”

The crowd could tell Huangfu Jiangyao’s aura was stronger too, but Ling Xiao was still able to stand his ground. This showed how powerful Ling Xiao was.

The crowd was cheering for Ling Xiao as they didn’t want to see another famed prodigy lose to the little-known Huangfu Heavenly Clan after Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu. To their relief, Ling Xiao’s performance thus far was nothing short of spectacular, to the point they could see a ray of hope for his victory.

“Huangfu Jiangyao, are you here to play?” the white-haired man suddenly asked.

Upon hearing those words, Huangfu Jiangyao quickly retrieved the wooden box he carried on his back and opened it. A black saber suffusing with lightning emerged from within.

Chu Feng’s eyes lit up upon seeing the black saber. It was a God Armament created specifically for those who possessed the Heavenly Bloodline.
