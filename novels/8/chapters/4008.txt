Chapter 4008 - Zhao Hong’s Defeat

Facing the Mystic Cave Saints acting in such a manner, Chu Feng found himself at a loss as to what to do.

Out of desperation, he turned his gaze to the spirit formation gate again.

He wanted to see how much longer it could last.

However, upon doing so, he discovered that Zhao Hong’s silhouette had reappeared in the spirit formation gate.

However, her current condition was not optimistic at all.

Zhao Hong... had lost an arm.

Furthermore, from her pained expression, Chu Feng knew that she was suffering from more than mere physical injuries.

Her soul had been seriously injured.

Looking towards the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster, one could see that he was completely unharmed.

The battle between them was truly world-shaking. From this, one could tell that they were not holding anything back.

Because of that, Zhao Hong’s injuries signified one thing.

Even though both of them were rank four Utmost Exalted, Zhao Hong was no match for the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

“I’m truly sorry. There’s no alternative, please excuse my offense,” as Chu Feng spoke, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak appeared on his body.

Chu Feng released his spirit power and instantly engulfed the Mystic Cave Saints with it.

All of the Mystic Cave Saints were restricted by his spirit power, and were unable to move.

Then, Chu Feng forcibly pulled out the Mystic Cave Saints’ Eldest’s hand and took the little golden person.

“Brother Asura, wait,” the Eldest said hurriedly. He knew that Chu Feng was planning to go.

“Since you insist on going, allow us to accompany you.”

“You will definitely not be able to withstand its backlash should you use it alone. You will definitely die once the backlash arrives.”

“We can help you. We brothers can help you withstand its power, and then transfer everything back to your body.”

“With that, even when the backlash comes, we brothers will be able to take it on together.”

“No matter how strong the backlash might be, you should be able to survive it.”

After hearing the words spoken by the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints, Chu Feng felt a warmth in his heart.

But he didn’t stop. Instead, he said to the Eldest, “My restrictive formation is linked to this spirit formation gate. Once the gate disappears, my restrictive formation will also disappear on its own.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng grasped the little golden person and stepped into the spirit formation gate.

Chu Feng had refused the kind intentions of the Mystic Cave Saints.

It was his own decision to rescue Zhao Hong. This was something that was unrelated to the Mystic Cave Saints to begin with.

As such, he did not wish for the Mystic Cave Saints to endure the risk; the potentially fatal danger, with him.

......

“Zhao Hong, is this all you’re capable of?”

“The you from back then wasn’t this weak.”

“It would appear that although you’ve been reborn, your talent did not increase, but has instead decreased.”

“And here I thought you’d become extremely powerful, seeing that you dared to find me for revenge. You also saw how I was truly terrified by you earlier.”

“Never would I have imagined that you were actually this weak. You’ve thoroughly disappointed me.”

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster looked at Zhao Hong with a mocking expression.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, golden light shone brightly. Zhao Hong had attacked again.

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster rushed forth to take her on without any hesitation.

Their confrontation this time around lasted merely an instant.

When they reappeared in the crowd’s eyes, the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster’s All-heaven Dragon Sword had pierced into Zhao Hong’s body.

That All-heaven Dragon Sword was also emitting lightning that entered Zhao Hong’s body with the sword, covering her completely.

Zhao Hong seemed to have lost the strength to continue fighting as a look of pain covered her face.

She was still enduring it. Even though everyone could tell from her facial expression that she was in immense pain, she did not let out a single groan of pain.

She was gritting her teeth tightly and enduring the pain that engulfed her body.

“Zhao Hong, taking our previous affection into consideration, as long as you hand over the Reincarnation Pearl, I can leave your corpse intact,” said the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

Even at that moment, he was still deeply interested in the Reincarnation Pearl.

“In your dreams.”

A look of determination appeared in Zhao Hong’s eyes. She was unwilling to compromise even if the alternative was death.

“Your temper remains the same. You’re still fond of drinking a forfeit instead of a toast,” the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster said with a cold smile.

“Zzzzz~~~”

The intensity of the lightning unleashed by the All-heaven Dragon Sword increased several-fold.

Like sharp blades, the lightning shuttled through Zhao Hong’s body repeatedly.

In the blink of an eye, Zhao Hong was left completely mutilated and her body completely tattered.

Her miserable appearance caused many female members of the younger generation to turn away in terror.

Not only was Zhao Hong’s body completely covered in wounds, but she had also grown abnormally weak. She was unable to even hold onto her Reincarnation Rune Sword.

However, when the Reincarnation Rune Sword fell from the sky, a hand suddenly appeared and grabbed it.

Then, that person held the Reincarnation Rune Sword and rushed towards the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

It turned out that it was the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster, Han Xiu.

“Liu Shuo, prepare to die!”

Anger filled Han Xiu’s face and killing intent filled her eyes.

Even her body had undergone a special sort of transformation. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

She had used an extremely powerful ability.

Han Xiu had unleashed all her strength with the intention of killing the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, before Han Xiu could even approach the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster, she let out a scream.

It was an oppressive might!

Without even moving, and merely by releasing his oppressive might, the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster had managed to restrict Han Xiu’s movement.

Not only that, but his oppressive might turned into an invisible hand that forcibly tore apart Han Xiu’s dantian.

In unbearable pain, Han Xiu screamed miserably.

“Xiu’er!”

Zhao Hong’s expression changed enormously upon witnessing such a scene, worry immediately filled her eyes.

“My, it would appear that the master and servant have quite a deep relationship.”

“Since that’s the case, you’ll really have to hand over the Reincarnation Pearl.”

“Otherwise, she’ll not only be simply losing her cultivation,” said the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

“Release her. As long as you release her, I will tell you the Reincarnation Pearl’s whereabouts,” said Zhao Hong.

“You’re trying to deceive me again?”

“You’re in no position to haggle with me.”

“Hand over the Reincarnation Pearl right now or else... I will take her life.”

As the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster spoke, he made a grabbing motion towards the void, and a martial power spear appeared in his hand.

He was threatening Zhao Hong.

He planned to kill Han Xiu unless Zhao Hong handed the Reincarnation Pearl over right away.

“Release her first. If you release her, I will definitely give you the Reincarnation Pearl,” said Zhao Hong.

“It would appear that you still don’t understand your current situation.”

With a smile on his face, the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster shook his head.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, he waved his hand, and the spear he held shot straight towards Han Xiu.

That spear was extremely powerful. Everywhere it passed, space crumbled.

Everyone could tell that the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster had not been holding back with his attack at all.

He fully intended to kill Han Xiu.

Actually, the instant she saw the martial power spear, Han Xiu knew that her soul would shatter and she would definitely be killed should the spear reach her.

As such, she closed her eyes the moment she saw the spear being thrown towards her.

She had made her ’preparations’ for death.

Ever since she had decided to accompany Zhao Hong, she had known the consequences of failure.

As such, there was no trace of fear on her face. Instead, she had a relieved expression.

It was as if she were going to return to her final resting place.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, a violent gale swept forth, causing her clothes to flutter violently. The wind was too strong, so strong that she felt a stinging pain on her face.

However, her anticipated death did not come.

Furthermore, to Han Xiu’s greatest surprise, she was able to hear voices of astonishment sounding from the crowd all around.

It seemed like another enormous change had occurred!
