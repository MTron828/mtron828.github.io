MGA: Chapter 1263 - Exploiting One Another

“You cannot stop me,” When she saw the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster blocking her path, a flash of coldness shone through Bai Suyan’s eyes. She did not have the slightest sentiment towards him, despite the fact that she was married to him.

“I am not planning to stop you,” Compared to the enormous coldness displayed by Bai Suyan, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster was considerably calm.

“In that case, what are you doing then?” Bai Suyan asked.

“I merely wish to send you off,” The Ascension Sect’s sectmaster smiled. His smile was very easy-going, it was as if he had already anticipated this day.

“Send me off?” Compared to the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster, Bai Suyan was surprised. She did not understand the Ascension Sect sectmaster’s intention.

“As the saying goes, a day together as husband and wife means endless devotion for the rest of your life. Even if you are to break away from my Ascension Sect, I will still not face you with weapons,” the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster said.

“Husband and wife?”

“Hah, Zhou Zhixian, while you and I are husband and wife in name, we have never actually done the deed between husband and wife.”

“Since you already knew that I was using you, for you to say these things now, don’t you feel dull at all?” Bai Suyan’s words contained a trace of mockery.

However, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster was not angered by Bai Suyan’s words, and the smile on his face remained unchanged. He said, “I anticipated that you had a special purpose to begin with. I do not plan to stop you at all. In fact, I want to thank you.”

“Thank me?” Bai Suyan was dumbfounded by the words spoken by the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“I wish to thank you for taking away that item that threatened our Ascension Sect,” the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster said.

“You knew?” When she heard those words, Bai Suyan’s eyes shone. She was shocked.

“Did you really think that our Ascension Sect’s ancestor constructed the Ascension Sect on this place by mere coincidence?” the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster replied with a smile. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Hearing those words, Bai Suyan came to a sudden realization. She asked, “Since you knew about the dangers of that item, then why didn’t you ask the Cyanwood Mountain for help, or move the Ascension Sect elsewhere?”

“Our ancestor left instructions that we could not move the Ascension Sect elsewhere, nor can we request help from the Cyanwood Mountain. All we could do was wait for the fated one to come and find this object. Thus, the previous generations of seniors from our Ascension Sect have all been waiting their entire lives. Never would I have imagined that during my generation, I actually managed to witness your arrival at long last,” said the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“You actually...” At this moment, the expression of surprise on Bai Suyan’s face grew even more intense.

“That’s right, I had deliberately revealed that jade ornament key to you so that I could lure you to take the bait.”

“Never would I have expected that I truly managed to lure in the person that countless of my successive seniors failed to wait for,” The Ascension Sect’s sectmaster said with a beaming smile on his face. It could be seen that he was very happy. Even though the current Ascension Sect was badly damaged, he was still extremely happy.

“Ha....” At this moment, Bai Suyan started to laugh. She had thought that she had perfectly used the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster to her advantage. Yet, never did she imagine that they were actually exploiting one another. “It would appear that I have underestimated you.”

“No, I was the one that has underestimated you. At the beginning, I merely thought you might be able to accomplish it. However, never did I imagine that you would actually succeed,” replied the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“In that case, I was truly exploited by you?” Bai Suyan seemed to feel a bit unreconciled.

“Neither one of us can be said to have exploited the other. At most, we have only taken what each one of us needed, and we do not owe each other anything. However, Suyan, might you be willing to show me exactly what that thing is to tempt my Ascension Sect’s ancestor like so, yet also bind his hands into being unable to do anything, and forcing us future generations to fear about it nonstop?” The Ascension Sect’s sectmaster asked.

“I’m afraid I can’t,” Bai Suyan shook her head.

“Then forget about it. After all, it does not belong to me. It’s fine if I do not see it. However, you’re injured. Shouldn’t we treat your injuries first before you leave?” The Ascension Sect’s sectmaster said.

“There’s no need. Farewell,” Speaking till this point, Bai Suyan did not wish to speak anymore and wanted to leave.

“Boom.” However, right at this moment, an enormous pressure came crushing down from afar.

While that pressure was invisible, it caused the space around them to twist and tremble. In an instant, the expressions of everyone present changed. That was because that oppressive might was simply too frightening, and was crushing the majority of the people here to death. Even Half Martial Emperors were no exception.

At this moment, even the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster had a grave expression on his face. The only person who was able to remain calm was Bai Ruochen’s mother, Bai Suyan.

“You’ve stayed for two years, why the rush?”

The center of that oppressive might began to faintly wiggle. Gradually, a figure walked out.

It was an old man. However, his appearance was extremely strange, he was ugly like an ape or monkey. However, his aura was extremely powerful. As for who he was, he was one of the Cyanwood Mountain’s management elders, Half Martial Emperor White Ape.

“We pay our respects to Elder White Ape.” When they saw Half Martial Emperor White Ape, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster and the various Ascension Sect management elders all courteously kneeled down to him.

At this moment, the only people who did not courteously greet him were Bai Suyan, Bai Ruochen, Chu Feng and Sima Ying.

Logically, as Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain, they should courteously greet him upon seeing him. However, as they just fought the Cyanwood Mountain to such a state, Chu Feng could not verify whether this Half Martial Emperor White Ape was friend or foe. Thus, he would naturally not courteously greet him.

At this moment, Bai Suyan was enraged. She felt that she had been tricked by the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster. “Zhou Zhixian, you are truly despicable.”

“I knew that you did not have such good intentions to not blame me and instead urge me to stay so as to treat my injuries after turning the Ascension Sect to such a state. After all this, you’ve asked for reinforcements and you were simply stalling for time.”

In her anger, with a thought, she tried to use a martial skill to fight Half Martial Emperor White Ape and then rapidly get away from this place.

However, to her surprise, not only did she receive external injuries, even her internal organs were greatly injured. Not only was she unable to successfully utilize her martial power, it also caused her to vomit a mouthful of blood.

“Mother,” Seeing this scene, Bai Ruochen was greatly frightened. It was the first time that she had seen her mother being so gravely injured.

At this moment, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster hurriedly explained himself. “Suyan, you’ve misjudged me. I did not know of Elder White Ape’s arrival.”

Half Martial Emperor White Ape suddenly spoke. “There’s no need for you to be so nervous. I have not come here for you, nor am I interested in meddling in your business.”

“I have come here for Chu Feng and Sima Ying,” As he spoke, he turned to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, I have heard about what happened with you. I also understand who is in the right and who is in the wrong.”

“I have already released Hong Mo and the other elders from the Punishment Department. I have also disciplined those from the Punishment Department. Come, return to the Cyanwood Mountain with me. I will provide you with a reasonable explanation.”

“Elder Hong Mo and the others are fine now?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was overjoyed. He was able to tell from Half Martial Emperor White Ape’s sincere gaze that he was not lying.

“Absolutely true,” Half Martial Emperor White Ape nodded with a smile. His attitude toward Chu Feng was extremely amiable.

“That’s truly great,” After verifying that Elder Hong Mo and the others were fine, Chu Feng was extremely happy. It was like an enormous knot in his heart was finally untied.

“Thank you Elder White Ape for your assistance. However, Chu Feng is not planning to return to the Cyanwood Mountain right now,” While being happy was one thing, Chu Feng still spoke his opinion.

“Do you plan to leave the Cyanwood Mountain?” After hearing those words, a trace of worry emerged on Half Martial Emperor White Ape’s face.

“Elder White Ape, Chu Feng is not planning to break away from the Cyanwood mountain. However, Chu Feng planned to leave the Cyanwood Mountain temporarily, so as to experience the outside world,” Chu Feng replied.

“So that’s the case. In that case, where do you plan to go?” Half Martial Emperor White Ape asked.

“I planned to request senior Bai to break the Boundary Energy for us. After that, I will send Sima Ying back to the World Spiritist Alliance. As for where to go after that, I have yet to decide.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he deliberately mentioned Bai Suyan and hinted that she was planning to help them. He hoped that Half Martial Emperor White Ape would not make things difficult for Bai Suyan because of what had happened in the Ascension Sect.

“Mn, that is fine.”

“However, before I came here, I had also received Hong Mo’s entrustment to help send Sima Ying back to the World Spiritist Alliance. It would appear that we will be journeying together,” Half Martial Emperor White Ape said.

“There’s no need. It would be fine for me to send them. There’s no need for you to get involved,” Right at this moment, Bai Suyan flatly refused.

Hearing those words, Half Martial Emperor White Ape started to frown and a trace of annoyance flashed through his eyes. Angrily, he shouted, “Truly impudent!”
