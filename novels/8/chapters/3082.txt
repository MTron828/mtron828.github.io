Chapter 3082 - Chu Feng’s Technique

The more the crowd looked at Chu Feng, the more questions emerged in their hearts.

Li Anzhi had already unleashed such a powerful Immortal Taboo Martial Skill. Thus, why would Chu Feng still have such a confident expression on his face?

“Li Anzhi, what are you doing? You’re planning to beat me with a shield?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s mouth moved. He revealed a mocking smile.

“Shield? I’ll have you know exactly what sort of shield this is!”

Li Anzhi let out a sudden shout. Then, from within the wind shield that was revolving around him came many wind blades. Those wind blades swept toward Chu Feng.

Those wind blades were so powerful that the hearts of the experts of the older generation all tensed up upon seeing them.

It was obvious to anyone with discerning eyes that Li Anzhi’s Immortal Taboo: Windblade Shield should be strongest in terms of defense.

That said, the wind blades that Li Anzhi sent forth were very powerful too. At the very least, those wind blades surpassed the might of a rank six Immortal Technique.

After sensing how powerful those wind blades were, many people started to worry deeply for Chu Feng again.

After all, judging from the situation at hand, even if Chu Feng possessed overwhelmingly powerful battle power and was capable of suppressing rank four Immortal Techniques with a rank three Immortal Technique, he would still not be able to block the incoming wind blades even if he were to use a rank five Immortal Technique.

The reason for that was because those wind blades’ power surpassed that of a rank six Immortal Technique.

Thus, Chu Feng must unleash a rank six Immortal Technique in order to block the incoming wind blades.

Merely, it was a general understanding that one had to be at least a rank nine Heavenly Immortal in order to learn rank six Immortal Techniques. With Chu Feng’s current cultivation, he evidently did not know any rank six Immortal Techniques.

With the situation being like that, would Chu Feng really be able to defend against those wind blades?

“Bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”

The next moment, explosions began to sound before Chu Feng. It was the sound of the wind blades shattering before Chu Feng and turning into frighteningly powerful wind that scattered in all directions, ravaging everything in their path.

That said, no matter how powerful the wind blades were, they were unable to cause any harm to Chu Feng at all.

The reason for that was because there was an invisible power shielding Chu Feng.

It was that invisible power that blocked Li Anzhi’s wind blades.

“How could this be?”

The crowd were all astonished. The first thing that came to their mind was that Chu Feng might know a rank six Immortal Technique.

If that were truly the case, then Chu Feng would simply be too frightening.

After all, even for geniuses, their cultivation still had to reach rank nine Heavenly Immortal in order to learn rank six Immortal Techniques.

As for Chu Feng, his actual cultivation was only that of a rank six Heavenly Immortal. That level of cultivation would find it difficult to learn and master even rank five Immortal Techniques; thus, how could he possibly master a rank six Immortal Technique?

“No, that’s not an Immortal Technique, that’s a martial skill, an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill!” Chu Xuanzhengfa suddenly shouted loudly.

“Immortal Taboo Martial Skill? Now that you mention it, that is indeed a martial skill. Chu Feng has actually grasped such a powerful Immortal Taboo Martial Skill?!!!”

The crowd were all alarmed by Chu Xuanzhengfa’s words.

Upon closer inspection, the crowd were able to tell that that the invisible power before Chu Feng was indeed filled with martial power, and did not contain any spirit power. This meant that it was a martial skill, and not an Immortal Technique.

That said, even among Immortal Taboo Martial Skills, there existed a difference in strength. To be able to block Li Anzhi’s wind blades, it naturally meant that Chu Feng’s Immortal Taboo Martial Skill was extremely powerful too.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Li Anzhi narrowed his brows, and wind blades were once again sent flying toward Chu Feng.

This time around, the wind blades were much stronger than before.

However, when those wind blades approached Chu Feng, they were once again neutralized by the invisible power that surrounded Chu Feng.

“How could this be?!”

While the bystanders were still fine, the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, especially Li Tianyou, were completely stunned.

They did not dare to believe that Chu Feng actually managed to block one of their Li Heavenly Clan’s strongest Immortal Taboo Martial Skills, the Immortal Taboo: Windblade Shield.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng revealed a grin on his face. He said to Li Anzhi, “What’s wrong? As one of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, is this all that you’re capable of?”

“Arrogance!” Chu Feng’s words immediately enraged Li Anzhi, and caused him to unleash a frantic barrage of attacks at Chu Feng. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Unfortunately, the earlier attack was evidently the strongest attack Li Anzhi was capable of. Thus, the following waves of attacks were all unable to bring any harm to Chu Feng. All of his attacks were neutralized by the invisible barrier before Chu Feng.

“Amazing! Exactly what sort of martial skill is Chu Feng using? It’s actually capable of blocking such powerful attacks from Li Anzhi?”

After observing for a while, the crowd began to voice their questions.

Compared to the might of Li Anzhi’s Immortal Taboo: Windblade Shield, Chu Feng’s Immortal Taboo Martial Skill appeared to be extremely weak.

However, such a subtle and even formless Immortal Taboo Martial Skill actually managed to block Li Anzhi’s attacks.

Because of this, the crowd began to ponder exactly what sort of Immortal Taboo Martial Skill Chu Feng was using.

It was not only the Li Heavenly Clansmen that were pondering this; the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and even the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, were also pondering this.

Unfortunately, none of them knew the answer to this question.

Suddenly, Chu Xuanzhengfa asked, “Lord Clan Chief, could it be... Chu Feng is using our clan’s Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield?”

“Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield?”

Chu Xuanzhengfa’s words managed to startle quite a few people from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield was originally one of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s clan-protection martial skills.

It was a protective martial skill that would protect its user like the air around them. Its defensive capabilities were extremely strong. Also like the air, it was formless. In fact, if its user were to deliberately conceal its aura, others would not even be able to detect the Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield’s existence.

When mentioning it, it truly resembled the martial skill Chu Feng was using.

That being said, there was a reason as to why the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan never thought about the Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield.

The reason for that was because ever since the Chu Heavenly Clan obtained the Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield, there had never been anyone that managed to successfully learn it.

Later on, they searched for experts to evaluate it. It was then determined that the Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield their Chu Heavenly Clan obtained was incomplete.

Because of that, the Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield had its status as one of their Chu Heavenly Clan’s clan-protection martial skills removed.

As the Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield was incomplete, how could anyone possibly learn and master it?

Could it be that Chu Feng was truly so powerful that he could even learn and master an incomplete Immortal Taboo Martial Skill?

Confused, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all turned their eyes to their Lord Clan Chief.

After all, if Chu Feng was truly using the Immortal Taboo: Atmosphere Shield, then it must’ve been taught to him by their Lord Clan Chief.

Thus, the answer would be revealed by their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief.

Before the focused gazes of the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief revealed a smile on his face, and nodded gently.

He said, “Precisely.”
