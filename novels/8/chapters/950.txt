MGA: Chapter 951 - Two Pieces of Information

Chu Feng soon arrived at the floating palace with Xuan Xiaochao and the others leading the way. Qiu Canfeng had personally built it, and it was an important area for war preparations. Even they didn’t have the qualifications to enter.

But Chu Feng, as the sect head, could naturally enter any place since this was a part of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.

After entering, Chu Feng discovered the Four Protectors—Qiu Canfeng, Xue Xiyue, Fu Liansheng, and You Mingdeng—were there.

Other than those four, there were also two more—Qiushui Fuyan and Taikou.

However, there was an unfamiliar person Chu Feng hadn’t seen before. It was an old man with a powerful aura—rank four Martial King. However, he wore a sickly complexion. It was quite evident he was the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s First Immortal.

After seeing Chu Feng, his expression was very strange. His gaze especially was very strange, as if he knew Chu Feng already.

Chu Feng even saw a hint of near indiscernible fear concealed within the First Immortal’s gaze as he looked at Chu Feng.

That made Chu Feng puzzled. He could not think of anything regarding himself that made a person like him feel fear.

“Everyone, get out. I want to talk to Chu Feng alone,” the First Immortal said after looking at Chu Feng carefully.

“That will not do. What if you intend to harm my sect head?” But You Mingdeng denied him immediately after he spoke.

“Sect head? He’s already become sect head?” The First Immortal felt quite surprised, but he still resolutely said, “If you want to have a discussion, get out. Otherwise, there will be none.”

“You...” Xue Xiyue was a bit displeased. She opened her mouth, about to spit out curses.

“All of you, leave,” Chu Feng interrupted.

“Chu Feng, this...” Qiushui Fuyan hurriedly cast a glance at Chu Feng, telling him to be more careful—the First Immortal was very dangerous.

“No matter. Seniors, head out for a moment. I feel that Senior First Immortal truly hopes to cooperate with us,” Chu Feng said with a faint smile. His face was completely calm.

“Whatever. Since Sect Head has spoken, let’s listen to him. We’ll step outside,” urged Qiu Canfeng as well when Chu Feng insisted.

“This... Then fine.” You Mingdeng reluctantly nodded.

At first, he was very dissatisfied with Chu Feng, and wanted Chu Feng dead no matter what. However, after Chu Feng became sect head, his attitude changed completely, and he became one of Chu Feng’s most loyal subordinates. He was absolutely convinced by his aptitude.

“First Immortal, if you dare to inflict harm upon my sect head, you will wish you were dead.”

But even so, Xue Xiyue and the others did not forget to fiercely warn the First Immortal before leaving. Only then did they head out.

“Senior First Immortal, although we faced each other as enemies before, I still truly feel sorry for what happened to Ya Fei.”

Chu Feng clasped his hands towards the First Immortal after everyone left, representing his apology. He believed the First Immortal had seen Ya Fei already. Even though she was only a Consciousness, if she were still awake, she would still retain her memories. Perhaps she had already told the First Immortal that Murong Xun killed him. And likely also what Chu Feng did to her.

“No need for that. Everything was Murong Xun’s fault. It’s unrelated to you.

“I’ve come here today to ask you only one thing. If I help you deal with the Immortal Execution Archipelago, will you truly be able to help Fei’er rebuild her body? Will you truly revive her?” the First Immortal asked gravely. As he presented that question, he fixed his eyes closely on Chu Feng, his gaze filled with desire.

“Ya Fei’s physical body has been destroyed. Her Source Energy has been cut, and I’m afraid other people’s bodies may not be compatible. Even if a body were created out of nowhere, it will still be very difficult to recombine her Consciousness with the new body.

“From antiquity, there have been countless examples of destroyed bodies but surviving Consciousnesses. However, if it were that easy to recreate a physical body and thus revive, there would be no such thing as death.

“I’ll be honest: I cannot guarantee Ya Fei’s resurrection. However, I will say that there are many profound techniques on the Misty Peak. Since Lady Piaomiao had spoken in such a manner, perhaps she truly does have a way to help Ya Fei,” Chu Feng said truthfully.

“Ahh... My poor Fei’er!” The First Immortal heaved a long sigh as the grief on his face became greater.

However, in the end, he still said, “Chu Feng, I will help you. But I will only help you reach the stone tablet. Whether you’ll be successful is your own business. I have nothing to do with that.

“Moreover, even though it was Murong Xun who killed Fei’er, I will not kill him. Similarly, I will not kill a single person from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.

“I can betray them, but I will not kill them.”

“Thank you, senior.”

Chu Feng rejoiced in his heart. Although the First Immortal held quite a position in the Immortal Execution Archipelago, from his words and actions, Chu Feng didn’t feel he was being lied to.

For Ya Fei, his precious granddaughter, he was truly preparing to help Chu Feng.

After concluding, Chu Feng called in Qiu Canfeng and the others. They started to discuss the specifics regarding their plan to deal with the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Of course, when doing these things, the First Immortal was asked to leave with Taikou accompanying him.

The First Immortal had already promised to help them. However, Chu Feng could tell, regardless of the First Immortal’s hatred towards the Immortal Execution Archipelago, he couldn’t bear attacking them due to his own kindness.

So, when they started planning how to attack the Immortal Execution Archipelago, naturally it’d be better to exclude him from the conversation. Otherwise, even if he could accept doing such things, there would be even greater guilty feelings in his heart.

“Chu Feng, we’ve heard two pieces of information when we were heading here. I feel that we must tell you this,” Qiushui Fuyan suddenly said.

“Sister Fuyan, what are they?” Chu Feng asked.

“A few days ago, an abnormal scene occurred above the Eastern Sea Region’s Fertile Continent. Its usual scalding summer atmosphere became a chilling air full of snow and ice.

“However, the snow and ice only stayed in the sky and didn’t fall down. It stretched outward for several thousands of miles. There were even roars akin to wild beasts that came from the snow,” Qiushui Fuyan said.

“A phenomenon? Does that mean it’s the descent of a Divine Body?” Xue Xiyue asked.

“I’m not sure. But from what I’ve heard, when a Divine Body appears, there will be indications. However, that scene suddenly appeared, then suddenly disappeared. No one knows what it meant. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“However, there’s only been so many occurrences like this that have appeared in the Eastern Sea Region. I feel it’s not normal for something to appear so suddenly,” Qiushui Fuyan said.

“I agree, it’s not normal at all. Sister Fuyan, what’s the second news?” Chu Feng asked.
