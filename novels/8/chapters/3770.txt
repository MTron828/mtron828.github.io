Chapter 3770 - The Specter’s Curse

“Chu Feng, exactly what is going on?” Gu Mingyuan and the others asked in unison.

Chu Feng began to tell them what he had learned from the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

The Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s grandson used to be a genius martial cultivator in his childhood.

He began cultivation at the age of five. At ten, he became a Half Martial Emperor.

Logically, with his talent, he would definitely become a grand and famed individual in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Unfortunately, when the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s grandson was ten years old, he encountered an accident.

He was poisoned. Someone had deliberately poisoned him. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Furthermore, the poisoning was not done by a single person. Instead, it was done by a group of people. Every one of them were very powerful, far more powerful than the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

Those people were wearing red cloaks and white conical bamboo hats. On their red cloaks were black characters with the words ‘Netherworld Envoy.’

The Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master didn’t understand why they had decided to poison his grandson.

However, ever since the poison had entered his grandson, he went from an intelligent and extremely talented individual to a mentally handicapped individual.

The Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master had tried all sorts of methods to cure him. Unfortunately, everything was to no avail.

He had also attempted to find those red-cloaked individuals to avenge his grandson and find a way to treat him.

Because of that, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master had practically traveled through the entire Holy Light Starfield.

Through his efforts, he had encountered those people two times. Unfortunately, he was defeated by them both times.

After being defeated, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall master had no choice but to kneel and beg.

He did not beg them to spare his life. Instead, he begged them to give his grandson the antidote to the poison.

However, those people that were originally planning to kill him actually retrieved their killing intent and spared him after learning about his grandson.

However, without exception, they did not give his grandson the antidote. They also did not inform the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master about why they’d poisoned his grandson.

To date, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master still didn’t understand why they had poisoned his grandson.

Chu Feng and the others, on the other hand, knew why those people had done that.

The reason for that was because it was simply not poison. Instead, it was a sort of monster.

Those red-cloaked individuals were simply not putting the monster in the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s grandson out of kind intentions.

Those red-cloaks individuals had deliberately selected a talented child to be the host for that monster.

According to the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master, that mysterious organization seemed to have a lot of members. Furthermore, they were very powerful, as all their members were top martial cultivation experts.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s grandson was most likely not the only casualty.

There should be a lot of other victims.

No one knew what the purpose of that organization was. However, what they’d done was most definitely not a good thing.

After all, putting that sort of monster into talented children and reducing their mental capability was in itself very vile. In fact, one could even say that that was a heinous and wicked crime.

Merely from that, one could tell how dangerous that organization was.

“Truly vile. They actually did such a despicable thing.”

Learning about it, Gu Mingyuan had a look of anger.

She was not the only one. All the people present were all furious.

That said, they were, at the same time, feeling very worried.

Such a dangerous power was spreading terrifying monsters throughout the Holy Light Galaxy.

Regardless of what they intended to do, it must be something very terrifying.

“We should report this matter to the Holy Light Clan.”

“We cannot allow that sinister power to continue committing crimes in the Holy Light Galaxy,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“Forget about it. Our Ancestral Martial Starfield is an Abandoned Starfield.”

“The Holy Light Clan simply does not care about our life and death. They will not concern themselves with this sort of matter.” Gu Mingyuan smiled bitterly and shook her head.

Hearing those words, Grandmaster went silent.

Although they stood atop the Ancestral Martial Starfield, their status was extremely petty and low in the Holy Light Galaxy.

“Sure enough, there’s no such thing as peace in places where martial cultivators exist. Being in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, we are faced with mutual deception. However, the entire Holy Light Galaxy is actually also equally chaotic and equally dangerous." The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sighed helplessly.

“Everyone, stop overthinking things. If it’s a fortune, it will not be a disaster. If it is a disaster, it cannot be avoided.”

“Rather than thinking about relying on others, it is better to strive hard to improve oneself," said Bai Liluo.

After saying those words, she looked at Chu Feng and smiled. “Little brother Chu Feng, is big sister not correct?”

“Big sister Liluo, what you’ve said is correct. If one is to rely on the mountain, the mountain could collapse. If one is to rely on another person, that person could run away. It is best to rely on oneself,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

Although he had discovered that there was a terrifying power in the Holy Light Galaxy plotting something terrifying, he was simply powerless to stop them.

Rather than having groundless fears, it was better to make the most of the time he had to improve oneself.

Thus, the look of worry disappeared from Chu Feng’s face.

“Wuuu~~~”

Suddenly, Bai Liluo’s exquisite little face started to distort.

She revealed a look of pain.

“Big sister Liluo, are you alright?”

Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately rushed over to Bai Liluo and supported her.

The others also began to examine her condition with worry on their faces.

Bai Liluo’s current condition was very abnormal. Not only did she have a look of pain on her face, but she was also grimacing. Furthermore, black gaseous flames were being emitted from her body.

The black gaseous flames soared into the sky and formed words.

‘Those who dare provoke me shall be cursed for the rest of their life!!!’

“This aura?!”

Seeing the distorted characters in the sky composed of black gaseous flames, Chu Feng and the others all tensed up.

The reason for that was because they were able to sense the aura of the Black-feathered Specter from the black gaseous flames.

“It’s the curse! This young lady has been cursed!” Grandmaster Liangqiu said with a look of alarm.

“The Black-feathered Specter has left a curse on her?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

Bai Liluo did not answer. She was in even more miserable pain.

Not only that, but black feathers also began to sprout from her body.

The black feathers pierced through her skin as they grew. Looking at them, one could tell that they were causing her great pain.

Most importantly, the black feathers were identical to the black feathers of the Black-feathered Specter.

“Big sister Liluo!”

Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu immediately released and enveloped Bai Liluo with their spirit power.

They were trying to alleviate her pain.

However, their actions were simply useless. They were simply unable to alleviate Bai Liluo’s pain.

They could only watch as she continued to suffer in anguish. They were completely powerless to help her.

Bai Liluo’s painful condition persisted for an entire hour before finally alleviating.

After the pain subsided, the black feathers started to ebb, and the black gaseous flames dissipated. The look of pain on Bai Liluo’s face also disappeared.

It seemed like nothing had happened.

“That damned Black-feathered Specter!”

Bai Liluo sat on the ground. She was panting for breath.

However, she reached like she was completely fine. There was no trace of worry on her face.

Suddenly, Bai Liluo looked to Chu Feng. Her little mouth spread open, and she revealed two rows of white teeth. She was actually smiling at him.

“Little brother Chu Feng, it seems like you’ve all witnessed that.”

“It’s alright. This is a minor issue. Such a torment is nothing for your big sister.”

Bai Liluo was smiling very brilliantly as she said those words.

However, Chu Feng was feeling upset. Although she spoke with such ease, although she was deemphasizing the situation, he knew that it was not that simple.

The Black-feathered Specter did not spare her at all. Instead, it had left a curse on her.

That curse would accompany her for the rest of her life, torturing her forever.

“It’s alright. You don’t have to look so anxious. Although that guy has left a curse on my body, I’ve also gained benefits from it. Come, sense your big sister’s aura.”

As Bai Liluo spoke, she released her boundless oppressive might.

“This aura?”

At that moment, all the people present were astonished.

The aura Bai Liluo emitted was that of a rank two Utmost Exalted. She was even stronger than Gu Mingyuan.

After all, she was an actual rank two Utmost Exalted.

“Big sister, is this the power you’ve gained from the Black-feathered Specter?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right. It’s not only cultivation; your big sister was only able to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist because of it too,” as Bai Liluo spoke, she revealed a proud look.

Hearing her words, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others looked at each other in dismay. They were all gasping with shock..

They suddenly realized that the Black-feathered Specter was not only a dangerous existence, but it seemed to also be a treasured cultivation resource???
