Chapter 3422 - Nine Dragons Saint Cloak Recognizing Its Master

Everyone was able to hear Grandmaster Liangqiu.

As such, everyone turned their gazes towards the location where Grandmaster Liangqiu was looking.

If the person who had breached the grand formation wasn’t Grandmaster Liangqiu, it would mean that it could only be those people of the younger generation that had entered the grand formation. As for which among them had breached the grand formation, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak would reveal the answer.

“There are signs of activity.”

Suddenly, Grandmaster Longxuan revealed a cheerful look.

An aura began to appear at the location where they were looking. Even though it was very faint, people of their caliber were still capable of seeing it.

The aura grew more and more intense. Soon, it turned into spirit power, and took the form of a spirit formation gate.

After the spirit formation gate appeared, several figures flew out from it. As for those people, they were none other than Chu Feng and the others.

“Where... are we now?”

After Chu Feng and the others appeared, Linghu Tiemian and the others were still puzzled.

“What’s going on with Linghu Tiemian and the others?”

Seeing the strange behavior from Linghu Tiemian and the others, the people of the younger generation all revealed looks of confusion.

“Chu Feng, Linghu Hongfei, what’s going on with them?”

At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others arrived before Chu Feng.

As Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei were the only ones that were still acting normally, they could only ask them what was going on.

“Grandmaster Liangqiu, so you were also present? That’s truly great.”

“Earlier, we entered the spirit formation gate opened by our spirit formation swords. After entering it, although we gained power, everyone was met with a backlash whilst assimilating with the power. Right now, they all seem to have suffered short-term memory loss. They will need some time to recover. However, with Grandmaster present, they should be able to recover quickly,” Linghu Hongfei said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt helpless.

Those were all things that Chu Feng had told Linghu Hongfei. Never did he expect for Linghu Hongfei to rush to announce them.

Although Chu Feng felt admiration for Linghu Hongfei’s ability to hide his true personality, his impression in Chu Feng’s heart was becoming worse and worse.

Linghu Hongfei was not only a shameless and despicable hypocrite, but he was actually also a person who enjoyed showing off for fake profit. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Chu Feng truly wondered how many tricks he had secretly used to obtain his current achievements and reputation.

“That really is the case. Fret not, I will treat them,” after observing them, Grandmaster Liangqiu discovered what Linghu Hongfei said to be very correct. Thus, he began to help treat the thirteen youngster’s injuries.

“Grandmaster, you...”

Linghu Hongfei’s expression changed upon seeing the spirit power released by Grandmaster Liangqiu. Then, he took a glance at Chu Feng, and felt increasingly upset.

He knew of Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others’ scheme, and also knew that Grandmaster Liangqiu being able to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist was related to them.

To be exact, it was related to Chu Feng.

Originally, it should have been him. Unfortunately, Chu Feng had appeared and snatched away all that would have belonged to him.

“Wuuu~~~”

After being treated by Grandmaster Liangqiu, the crowd finally regained their awareness.

After regaining their awareness, the first person they saw was Grandmaster Liangqiu, who was treating their injuries, as well as the spirit power he emitted.

Upon seeing the Dragon Mark Saint-level spirit power, the crowd were all pleasantly surprised. In terms of feeling the most joyous, it would be none other than the Liangqiu Sisters.

“Master, we... heavens, master you... you became a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?!”

“Congratulations Master, Congratulations Master.”

The Liangqiu Sisters had just regained their memory, and were still somewhat muddle-headed. However, upon seeing the spirit power emitted by Grandmaster Liangqiu, the two of them were immediately wild with joy.

“The two of you have gained considerably this time around too,” Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke with a smile.

Hearing those words, the Liangqiu Sisters were at first startled, and somewhat confused. However, they soon came to understand his words, and immediately released their spirit power.

At that moment, although the Liangqiu Sisters’ spirit power was still Exalted-level, they were no longer covered in Insect Mark veined patterns. Instead, they had become Snake Mark patterns.

“We’ve made a breakthrough! Our spirit power also had a breakthrough!” Upon seeing their spirit power, the Liangqiu Sisters became even more excited.

Seeing that, the others immediately released their spirit power too.

Apart from the Liangqiu Sisters, Wuma Shengjie and Tantai Xing’er both managed to make a breakthrough, and become Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritists.

However, the others did not manage to make a breakthrough. Even Linghu Yueyue, the person with the strongest talent for world spirit techniques among them, didn’t make a breakthrough.

“What is going on? It’s one thing for us to fail to make a breakthrough, but why would you also fail to make a breakthrough, Yueyue?” Linghu Tiemian had a confused look on his face.

At that moment, Linghu Yueyue didn’t say anything. Instead, she looked at Chu Feng.

Whilst others might not have understood her sudden glance toward Chu Feng, Tantai Xing’er immediately understood what was going on.

“Young master Chu Feng, many thanks,” Tantai Xing’er arrived before Chu Feng and expressed her thanks

“Young master Chu Feng, thanks for this time,” Liangqiu Lanyue also walked over to Chu Feng to express her thanks.

Liangqiu Hongyue also leaped over to Chu Feng. With a beaming smile, she patted Chu Feng’s shoulder. “Chu Feng, it would appear that we sisters owe you another one.”

Even Wuma Shengjie looked at Chu Feng, and bluntly said, “Thanks.”

If the crowd didn’t understand what was going on before, they all understood now.

It would appear that the fact that Wuma Shengjie, the Liangqiu Sisters and Tantai Xing’er were able to make a breakthrough had something to do with Chu Feng.

It was due to Chu Feng’s help that they were able to smoothly make a breakthrough.

Suddenly, Liangqiu Hongyue asked with a look of curiosity, “Chu Feng, in that case, what level is your spirit power at now?”

Hearing that, Wuma Shengjie, Tantai Xing’er and even Linghu Yueyue and the others all looked at him with curiosity.

The Liangqiu Sisters, Wuma Shengjie and Tantai Xing’er were able to make a breakthrough in world spirit techniques with Chu Feng’s help. Normally, it would mean that Chu Feng’s own world spirit techniques must’ve experienced a breakthrough too.

Faced with the curious Liangqiu Hongyue, Chu Feng smiled and said, “Take a guess.”

“Tsk, trying to beat around the bush? Did you think I wouldn’t know if you refused to tell?” Liangqiu Hongyue curled her lips and looked towards Grandmaster Liangqiu, “Master, quickly, tell me what Chu Feng’s current level is.”

Grandmaster Liangqiu smiled and stroked his beard. “It’s better that you ask young friend Chu Feng. Even this old man is unable to determine what level his world spirit techniques are at.”

“Ah? Even Master is unable to see through him?”

“This guy, he couldn’t possibly... have managed to make a breakthrough to Saint-cloak, right?” Liangqiu Hongyue had a look of amazement. Besides becoming a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, it would be impossible for her master, with his strength, to not be able to determine what level Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were at.

Once Liangqiu Hongyue’s words were spoken, the crowd were all astonished.

Saint-cloak?

If Chu Feng broke through to Saint-cloak, wouldn’t the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist be Chu Feng?

Then, what about Linghu Hongfei?

“Humph, how could that be? Even if someone is able to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, that person must be our clan’s Linghu Hongfei. How could Chu Feng possibly be able to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist?” Linghu Tiemian spoke loudly.

Once he finished saying those words, the other people of the younger generation present also felt his words to be very reasonable.

If Linghu Hongfei weren’t present, then, with Chu Feng’s performance, the crowd would be able to accept it if he were to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

However, should Linghu Hongfei be present, Chu Feng would definitely not be able to obtain such an opportunity.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, a sudden ray of light sprinkled down from the sky.

Sensing the dazzling light that suddenly sprinkled down, everyone raised their eyes.

Upon doing so, the crowd present all felt extremely excited and nervous.

The grand formation set up by the World Spiritist Immortal King had been breached. Yet, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was still present.

Currently, the extremely valuable Nine Dragons Saint Cloak that not even the Queen Mother Fox Immortal was able to touch had actually moved.

Not only did it move, it was even gently descending from the sky.

Furthermore, the direction where it was descending was where Linghu Hongfei was standing.
