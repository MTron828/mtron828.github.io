Chapter 3242 - The Profound Mysteries Of The Great Formation

“Wuuuahh~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng felt an enormous tornado sweeping him up. Then, he lost control of his body and fell into that Immortal Armament Furnace.

In the blink of an eye, Chu Feng’s body was completely engulfed by the flames. Practically instantly, Chu Feng’s body was completely burned away.

It simply did not seem like Chu Feng had only fallen into a furnace.

Instead, Chu Feng felt as if he had fallen into hell, and was enduring the torture of the flames from hell.

Not even Chu Feng was able to tolerate the pain from the flames. Unable to contain himself, Chu Feng started to scream miserably.

“Chu Feng, you must endure longer and not disappoint me,” Linghu Mingye looked to Chu Feng, who was inside the furnace and being burned by the flames, with a smile on his face.

Seeing Chu Feng struggling inside the furnace, seeing Chu Feng’s miserable expression of being in intolerable pain, Linghu Mingye became very pleased, and even somewhat excited.

He simply had no desire to plunder Chu Feng’s Symbol of Light.

Even though Chu Feng and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen had such overwhelmingly powerful Symbols of Light, Linghu Mingye was still completely uninterested.

The reason for that was because Linghu Mingye felt that the cruelest punishment for Chu Feng and the others would be to have them suffer this sort of torture continuously until they decided to abandon everything and leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm themselves.

“Mn?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Not long afterward, however, Linghu Mingye’s expression changed. A trace of displeasure appeared on his previously excited face.

He had discovered that Chu Feng, who was screaming miserably in pain earlier, had actually closed his mouth.

There was still an expression of pain on Chu Feng’s face. His body was still being burned away by the furnace’s raging flames, only to then be restored by the protective formation of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Chu Feng was undergoing this sort of torture repeatedly.

However, Chu Feng was no longer screaming in pain.

He had actually managed to endure the pain.

This caused Linghu Mingye to frown slightly, and feel even more displeased.

However, soon, a cold smile appeared on his face again. He said, “Interesting. Compared to them, you are indeed quite extraordinary.”

“However, I shall see exactly how long you can persevere.”

After he finished saying those words, Linghu Mingye pushed his palms forward, and boundless martial power began to flow from his palms. That martial power then processed to assimilate into his Immortal Armament Furnace.

“Boom~~~”

Immediately, the furnace became even more enormous. Furthermore, the raging flames within it surged even more violently.

In fact, ear-piercing snarls and low-pitched roars could be heard from within the raging flames.

Those sounds were not caused by Chu Feng. Instead, they were being emitted by the raging flames.

Those were no longer raging flames. Instead, they were simply ferocious fiery beasts. As for those ferocious fiery beasts, they were tearing away at Chu Feng and disintegrating his body repeatedly.

With the situation being like that, the expression of pain on Chu Feng’s face grew more and more intense. However, Chu Feng still did not let out any screams of pain.

Chu Feng had managed to endure the pain. Even though Linghu Mingye had strengthened the power of his Immortal Armament Furnace, Chu Feng was still able to endure the pain.

Meanwhile, the crowd were still gathered on the main formation’s plaza.

They had no idea what was happening inside the Holy Spirit Formation of Light at that moment. They also did not know that Linghu Mingye was currently torturing Chu Feng. However, at that moment, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen finally had smiles on their faces.

After all, Li Anzhi and the other Li Heavenly Clansmen had all been expelled from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light by Linghu Mingye.

Furthermore, they had learned from Li Anzhi and the others that a change had occurred to the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, and that Chu Feng and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all captured by Linghu Mingye.

As such, they determined that Chu Feng and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen were doomed.

At that moment the only thing they needed to do was to wait. They were waiting for Chu Feng and the others to be expelled from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light like Li Anzhi and the other Li Heavenly Clansmen.

However, even after they waited for a long time, the crowd still saw no sign of Chu Feng. In fact, they saw no sign of any Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

This caused the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were originally feeling pleased to start worrying slightly.

Feeling uneasy, a Linghu Heavenly Clansman quietly asked Linghu Tiemian, “How come no one from the Chu Heavenly Clan has been expelled from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light yet?”

“Don’t fret. Since Mingye has decided to act, Chu Feng and the others are destined to be doomed.”

“From my understanding of Mingye, he will not let Chu Feng and the others off that easily. He will make them suffer and wish they were dead. Likely, Chu Feng and the others are undergoing the darkest period of their lives right now,” Linghu Tiemian spoke proudly.

Not only did Linghu Tiemian have a very complacent expression on his face, but he was also filled with confidence.

It was as if he was able to see the scene of Chu Feng and the others being tortured by Linghu Mingye.

It was not that Linghu Tiemian was overly confident. Instead, he was merely filled with confidence in Linghu Mingye.

“If they are tortured excessively, and that Chu Feng refuses to voluntarily leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, he will likely suffer from a mental breakdown and go insane,” another Linghu Heavenly Clansman spoke worriedly.

“Judging from your tone, you seem to be afraid of that Chu Feng?” Linghu Tiemian asked.

“If it were someone else from the Chu Heavenly Clan, there would naturally be no need to fear them. However, that Chu Feng is, after all, Chu Xuanyuan’s son. I’ve heard about that Chu Xuanyuan many times from our clan’s seniors.”

“Although that Chu Xuanyuan is also a person of the younger generation to those seniors, even though he is not that much older than us, the seniors from our clan all spoke with great reverence whenever they mentioned Chu Xuanyuan. From this, it could be seen that Chu Xuanyuan is not someone to be trifled with,” that Linghu Heavenly Clansman said.

“Humph, no matter how much he is not to be trifled with, so what? Whilst other Heavenly Clans might fear that Chu Xuanyuan, our Linghu Heavenly Clan doesn’t fear him. Are you to say that Chu Xuanyuan is stronger than the people from the Starfield Master Realm?” Linghu Tiemian said.

“This... from the words of our clan’s seniors, that Chu Xuanyuan...” That Linghu Heavenly Clansman still wanted to continue speaking. He was naturally trying to say that Chu Xuanyuan was stronger than the Starfield Master Realm.

“Don’t listen to the rubbish spoken by those old farts. If that Chu Xuanyuan is so powerful, how could he be imprisoned by a mere Chu Heavenly Clan?” Linghu Tiemian spoke in a disapproving manner.

Seeing that Linghu Tiemian had gotten angry, that Linghu Heavenly Clansman who was worried about Chu Feng found it difficult to continue to voice his concern.

Meanwhile, inside the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. Chu Feng was still inside Linghu Mingye’s Immortal Armament Furnace.

The flames inside the furnace were still surging violently. Chu Feng’s body was still being burned away and restored repeatedly.

However, not only did Chu Feng not scream in pain, but the expression of pain on his face had also eased greatly.

The reason for that was because the scenes of the Ancient Era’s battle that Chu Feng witnessed in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light’s formation core began to emerge in his head repeatedly after he was sucked into the Immortal Armament Furnace.

Merely, when the scenes of the battle appeared in Chu Feng’s head again, Chu Feng was no longer merely witnessing how powerful those Ancient Era’s martial cultivators were.

Instead, Chu Feng had managed to obtain some enlightenment.

It was... in regards to the mysteries of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

If Chu Feng was able to decipher those mysteries, he would be able to gain control over the entire Holy Spirit Formation of Light!!!
