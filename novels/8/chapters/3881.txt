Chapter 3881 - Who’s Asura?

“Damn it! Exactly who is it that dares to provoke our All-heaven Sect like this?!”

Tuoba Chengan was not the only one fuming with rage. The others from the All-heaven Sect were also all gnashing their teeth angrily.

“Lord Supreme Elder, what are we to do now?”

Although they were furious, the elders of the All-heaven Sect all turned their gazes to Tuoba Chengan.

To be able to enter the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb without them detecting anything, and then successfully snatch away the treasures under the care of the elders of their All-heaven Sect, it was sufficient to show that those plunderers possessed extraordinary strength.

One should know that there were even Utmost Exalted-level experts amongst the elders that had been robbed.

Yet, even the elders of their cultivation were unable to protect their treasures.

From this, they could imagine that their opponents were not people to be looked down on.

“Did you all manage to determine the appearance of the people that snatched your treasure?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Furthermore, do you know their cultivations?” Tuoba Chengan asked the elders that had been robbed.

The answers from those elders caused Tuoba Chengan even greater unease.

They simply did not know what the cultivation of the people that had robbed them was, as they did not use martial power at all. Instead, they had used some sort of special power.

That power was not purely spirit power, nor was it martial power.

As for appearances, they did not know how they looked either. The reason for that was because the people that had robbed them were all enveloped by that special power, making it so that they were simply unable to see their appearances.

“Lord Supreme Elder, could it be that it’s not that someone wanted to make an enemy out of our All-heaven Sect but instead it’s that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb is guarded?” asked an elder from the All-heaven Sect.

“That is indeed possible,” said Tuoba Chengan.

All of this was simply too strange. That simply did not resemble power that ordinary world spiritists could possess.

However, there was one thing that did not make sense. If they were indeed guardians left behind by the Great Monster Slayer Emperor, why would they send him those prank-like letters? Furthermore, why would they all be addressed to him, Tuoba Chengan?

“Let’s wait for Grandmaster Huang to come out," said Tuoba Chengan.

The others from the All-heaven Sect nodded in agreement.

As matters stood, they had no choice anymore. They could only rely on Grandmaster Huang now.

After all, places like tombs were ruled by world spiritists. No matter how strong of a cultivation they possessed, there was nothing they could do there.

For certain things, they simply could not be explained through conventional reasoning. Martial power would also not be able to resolve those things. Only world spirit techniques would allow one to overcome all obstacles.

“Damn it! Damn it all!”

Right at that moment, Grandmaster Huang flew out from the entrance with all the remaining experts of the All-heaven Sect.

However, at that moment, Grandmaster Huang had a very sorry look to him.

Not only was he completely dirtied, but he was even emitting a stink.

That seemed to be... the smell of feces.

No, it wasn’t that it seemed to be. It was feces.

When the people from the All-heaven Sect saw Grandmaster Huang approaching them, they immediately covered their noses and moved aside. Every one of them looked at him with contempt in their eyes.

They were all obsessed with cleanliness. Whilst they were not afraid of being dirtied by blood, they were very scared of being dirtied by piss and shit. If they were to accidentally get in contact with piss or shit, they would have nightmares the entire night.

The reason for that was because they believed themselves to be sacred. If they were to be tainted by those filthy things, it would damage their sacredness.

“Grandmaster Huang, what is this...?”

“Why do you look like that?”

Tuoba Chengan was at a complete loss after seeing Grandmaster Huang like that.

Originally, he was planning to wait for Grandmaster Huang to settle the problem inside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb for him.

However, judging from the situation at that moment, Grandmaster Huang was powerless to defend himself. Evidently... the people that had robbed their treasures were an even thornier problem than he had originally anticipated.

“You’re asking me? I told you to guard this place, how could you allow others to sneak in?”

“Look at me! See what happened to me?!”

Grandmaster Huang was extremely furious. He placed all the blame on Tuoba Chengan.

“Grandmaster Huang, I requested your assistance with an extremely high price because I needed you to help me solve problems.”

“And now, not only are you unable to solve the problems, but you’re even blaming me for it?”

Tuoba Chengan’s attitude had changed slightly.

He was no longer as cordial, yielding and respectful as before. Instead, he was becoming annoyed.

He had never actually felt true respect for that Grandmaster Huang at all.

He had only been courteous towards him because he had no other choice, and needed his world spirit techniques to assist him.

However, Tuoba Chengan was now aware that there were existences that Grandmaster Huang could not handle in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

With the situation being like that, Grandmaster Huang served no purpose anymore. Naturally, there was no need for him to be courteous toward him now.

“What about the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb did I not resolve it for you?”

“I’ve opened the entrance for you and helped you all obtain the treasures. What else could you possibly want me to do?”

“Ask them! Did any of the spirit formations I taught them not work?”

Grandmaster Huang pointed to the All-heaven Sect’s elders.

At that moment, those elders all lowered their heads in silence.

They had indeed obtained treasures following Grandmaster Huang’s instructions.

Unfortunately, all of those treasures had been robbed.

“What use is there in being able to retrieve those treasures? You’ll have to be able to bring them out to be useful. You were in there retrieving treasures, yet you ended up having all the treasures stolen by others. This means that you’re incompetent,” said Tuoba Chengan.

“Bullshit!”

“This old man settled all the problems inside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb for you.”

“The people robbing the treasures are clearly your enemies, the hell does this have to do with me?”

“Look at it yourself! They’ve poured shit all over this old man, fed this old man poison and demanded that I hand this letter to you. Or else... this old man would be killed by that poison." Grandmaster Huang was trembling with fury as he took out a letter and handed it to Tuoba Chengan.

However, before giving him the letter, Grandmaster Huang was unable to keep himself from cursing, “Furthermore, exactly who the fuck is that Asura fellow?!”

“Asura???”

Hearing that name, the people from the All-heaven Sect all tensed up.

It was not only Tuoba Chengan. Instead, it was all of them.

After all, they knew that name very well.

After Tuoba Chengan lowered his head to look at the letter, he discovered that the letter was not only addressed to him, but it was also signed. As for the name on the letter, it was none other than Asura.

“You, get over here and open the letter!”

Tuoba Chengan did not open the letter himself after receiving it from Grandmaster Huang. Instead, he randomly selected an elder and ordered him to open the letter.

At that moment, that elder was nearly about to cry.

He had personally witnessed the extremely stinky fart that came from the letter that Tuoba Chengan had opened previously.

On top of that, Grandmaster Huang was completely covered in shit and piss.

Who knew what might emerge from the letter after it was opened?

Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do. That was an order from his Lord Supreme Elder. He did not dare to disobey at all. Thus, after clenching his teeth, he decided to open the letter.

“Buzz~~~”

After the letter was opened, a ray of light immediately soared into the sky. The crowd were able to see that there was a series of words in the middle of the sky.

Seeing those sacred-looking words flickering with golden light, the people from the All-heaven Sect all revealed great displeasure on their faces.
