Chapter 5228: Chu Feng Arrives

Chu Feng proceeded to ask Bitter Remembrance how strong the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan were, and he learned that they did have formidable prodigies even though their clan was in decline.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan bore great hopes for the younger generation, and they believed that they were the key that determined whether the clan could rise through the ranks.

Most of the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan focused their efforts on furthering their world spirit techniques. Of them, 21 had reached rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation and 3 had reached rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation.

The junior who had hunted down the spirit beast containing a secret formation was one of the 3 rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists. While he was worthy of being considered a prodigy, he was far from a match for Chu Feng.

As long as Chu Feng was able to sneak into the mountain valley, he would be able to massacre all of them.

“The most powerful generation since the founding of their clan?”

Chu Feng was excited to hear the news. The more the Situ World Spiritist Clan valued their juniors, the more despaired they would be after those juniors were killed.

Having come to a decision, Chu Feng accompanied Song Yuwei and the others to the Spirit Beast Upper Realm.

…

In one of the Totem Galaxy’s Upper Realms, there was a dimly-lit ancient palace that was suffused with extremely powerful spirit power. This was the ideal condition to advance one’s spirit power, but none of the people present in the palace were cultivating at all.

There were too many worries in their minds to focus on their cultivation.

Daoist Seventh Dragon, Eighth Dragon, and Ninth Dragon were also inside this ancient palace, and they were standing before a white-haired elder with a long beard.

The white-haired elder was none other than Daoist Sixth Dragon.

Daoist Sixth Dragon stroked his lower jaw with a deep frown on his face as he paced around the room, pondering hard on something. Moments later, he finally came to a halt and turned to look at the trio.

“Are you certain that he said that he was Taowu from the Ancient Era?”

The other three daoists had just informed Daoist Sixth Dragon about what they had encountered in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm.

“There’s no doubt about it. The aura he emanates seems to be real too. I have never sensed anything as terrifying as that,” Daoist Seventh Dragon said.

“I don’t think it’s fake either. I get goosebumps just thinking about it,” Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon added.

“Why did the three of you come back then? Where’s Chu Feng? Why aren’t you protecting him? Aren’t you afraid that Taowu might kill you if anything happens to Chu Feng?” Daoist Sixth Dragon asked.

“Ey, it’s not that we have never considered protecting Chu Feng. That old monster did say that he would hold us responsible if anything harm befell Chu Feng. It’s just that we were so afraid that Taowu would break his promise that we chose to run away first,” Daoist Seventh Dragon said.

“Sixth Brother, our other brothers are either in closed-door training or out of the Totem Galaxy. The four of us are the only ones here. Why don’t you tell us what we should do now? Should we go into hiding or protect Chu Feng?” Daoist Eighth Dragon asked.

Cold sweat was trickling down his back even now. That was how much his encounter with Taowu had traumatized him.

“Yeah, Sixth Brother.”

Daoist Ninth Dragon nodded in agreement. He would wipe off the cold sweat from his face every now and then with his trembling hands. He looked to be in a worse state than Daoist Eighth Dragon.

“I doubt that anyone will be able to hurt Chu Feng with someone like Taowu backing him. It’s also too hasty for us to conclude that the beast is Taowu just from his powerful aura. Still, it’s better to be safe than sorry. We’ll be goners if the beast you encountered is truly the legendary Taowu and harm befalls Chu Feng. Even our First Brother and Second Brother would struggle against an existence of that caliber,” Daoist Sixth Dragon analyzed.

“What do you think we should do then, Sixth Brother?” Daoist Seventh Dragon asked.

“I think we should still protect Chu Feng,” Daoist Sixth Dragon said.

“All right, I’ll make an announcement right away that Chu Feng is under our protection. I can tell from that fellow’s face that he’s the kind of person who gets into trouble at every turn. I’m really worried that he might just get killed by someone else the moment we turn our eyes away for a brief second,” Daoist Seventh Dragon said worriedly.

He was worried not worried about Chu Feng’s death but Taowu’s vengeance.

“No, we shouldn’t make an announcement. We, the Totem Nine Daoists, have never made such declarations before, and it’ll only sully our reputation if others learn that we have done so out of fear. We don’t even know if the Taowu you encountered is the real thing. It’s one thing if the four of us lose honor, but we can’t drag First Brother and Second Brother down with us,” Daoist Sixth Dragon said.

“You’re right, Sixth Brother. We should leave the decision whether to make the announcement or not to First Brother and Second Brother. Otherwise, we’ll be punished if we make an announcement but they disapprove of our decision,” Daoist Seventh Dragon agreed with a nod.

“Sixth Brother, how do you think we should go about it?” Daoist Eighth Dragon asked.

“Let’s find Chu Feng first and secretly protect him from the shadows. Remember, we mustn’t reveal ourselves. You don’t need to feel too worried about this matter. Even if the beast you have encountered is the real Taowu, we might still stand a chance against him. You also know how powerful our First Brother and Second Brother are. Legends ultimately have some degree of exaggeration in them,” Daoist Sixth Dragon said.

“You’re right, Sixth Brother. We don’t fear anyone as long as First Brother and Second Brother are around,” the other three daoists replied.

“All right. Let’s split up and quickly find Chu Feng first,” Daoist Sixth Dragon instructed.

The three of them replied with a nod. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

For the time being, they had decided to secretly protect Chu Feng till the return of their First and Second Brother or when their other brothers came out of their closed-door training.

…

All of the higher-ups of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, with the exception of the clan chief who was in closed-door training and those who were out on mission, were gathered in the True Dragon Starfield’s Spirit Beast Upper Realm.

This matter concerned the future of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, so they weren’t going to risk even the slightest room for error here.

Two elders stood at the top of a mountain peak.

One of them was the strongest grand elder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, Situ Tingye, whereas the other was the grand elder whom Chu Feng had met in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm, Situ Hongbo.

Situ Hongbo had just informed Situ Tingye about the events that had transpired in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. They didn’t know who had acquired the treasures inside the demon coffin, but they suspected that the Totem Nine Daoists were the ones who had the final laugh.

Needless to say, the Totem Nine Daoists were beyond the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s means to deal with, so they could only swallow down their grievances.

However, their confrontation with Chu Feng was a different matter. Situ Hongbo wasn’t sure how he should deal with that, so he decided to consult Situ Tingye on the matter.

“Yet another brat is causing trouble for our Situ World Spiritist Clan?”

Situ Tinge frowned upon hearing the news.

“Milord, I don’t think that there’s any reason for us to be afraid. Chu Feng might be a formidable world spiritist, but he’s still a mere junior. Old Cat is also not someone we need to be wary of. The only problem here is Tao Wu.

“He’s a strong world spiritist whom I wouldn’t have to make an enemy out of under normal circumstances, but the problem is that far too many people have witnessed our humiliation. I fear that others might take us lightly if we don’t respond to this matter, but at the same time, I’m uncertain if we do have the resources to deal with Tao Wu. That’s why, I hope that milord can make a call on this matter,” Situ Hongbo said.

“Our manpower will be stretched too thinly if we go after them as well. For the time being, we’ll drop Chu Feng from our wanted list. It’ll affect our honor, but we’ll just have to tolerate it for the time being. What we have to do now is to focus our efforts on dealing with the remnants of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect.”

Situ Tingye could feel shivers running down his spine just thinking about what he had witnessed in that ancient city that day.

That battle had cost them nine thousand of their elites, including ten White Dragon God-cloak and two Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists. That was a huge loss in manpower for their Situ World Spiritist Clan.

However, what truly unnerved him was the sheer cruelty displayed by the enemy. He could hardly eat or sleep at ease knowing that such a vindictive enemy was on their back.

“I understand. I’ll make arrangements accordingly,” Situ Hongbo said.

What Situ Tingye and Situ Hongbo didn’t know was that despite their decision to spare Chu Feng for the time being, the latter had already arrived at the Spirit Beast Upper Realm.

Bee’s Author Note:

Stop fussing over why everything is about juniors. This story is about juniors.Also, stop getting caught up over why Chu Feng is weak. Think about how old he is. Even if he encounters prodigies who are stronger than him, they are also older than him.Really, you claim that Chu Feng is too strong in the early phases of the story, only to say that he’s too weak now. That is simply how the story progresses.If Chu Feng’s talent isn’t overpowered in the Lower Realms, how can he survive in the world of cultivation? Now that he’s faced with the most talented prodigies, he can’t possibly still kill them like flies with just a smack of his hand, right?That’d be illogical.
