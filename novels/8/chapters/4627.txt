Chapter 4627: Helpless Goats Before a Tiger

Xia Yan frowned in distress.

After all, the enemy they had to deal with here was no other than Gognsun Yuntian.

She had witnessed Chu Feng’s prowess thus far. Despite having only grasped rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation, he had somehow managed to gain control over a sliver of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace’s powers, allowing him to exert strength beyond his means.

Had it been any other circumstances, Chu Feng might have still stood a chance against Gongsun Yuntian in this labyrinth. However, he had weakened himself from breaching the formation, such that he had nearly depleted all of his spirit power.

In his current state, even with the powers of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, there was no way he could oppose Gongsun Yuntian.

“Oh? What’s with that bitter look on your face?”

It was in this tense moment that Xia Yan suddenly felt a hand grabbing her shoulder—Chu Feng.

Surprisingly, Chu Feng was not showing any hint of fluster at all despite the adverse circumstances they were in. On the contrary, he was showing a composed smile even.

For some reason, Chu Feng’s confidence brought her composure too. Despite feeling hopeless just a moment ago, she suddenly had an inexplicable feeling that they might still stand a chance here.

Perhaps, Chu Feng might just have a countermeasure here.

“Chu Feng, kneel down and beg us for mercy, and we’ll consider leaving you a whole corpse.”

A prodigy of the Gongsun Clan stepped forward and pointed a finger at Chu Feng arrogantly, demanding him to bow down.

In his view, it was already over for Chu Feng, So, the tone of voice he took was high and lofty, as if he was a judge presiding over Chu Feng’s life and death here.

“Shut your mouth. You aren’t qualified to talk to me.”

Yet, contrary to his expectations, Chu Feng silenced him without any hesitation before turning his gaze to Gongsun Yuntian.

“Gongsun Yuntian, I reckon that you must have thought that you were very smart. You bided your time in the shadows, waiting patiently for me to breach this formation before making your appearance to snatch this Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl from me,” Chu Feng remarked.

“Are you saying that I wouldn’t be able to obtain the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl without you? Hah! I can tell you frankly that even if you have failed, the pearl would have still been mine. The only reason why I remained hiding all this while is to see what you’re capable of, and admittedly, it does seem like I have underestimated you all this while. But how unfortunate, you still have to die today!”

Boom!

A powerful burst of spirit power gushed forth from Gongsun Yuntian’s body toward Chu Feng.

This was the strength of a world spiritist who had grasped rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, a force comparable to that of a rank one Martial Exalted cultivator.

Boom!

But before the spirit power reached Chu Feng, a wall suddenly rose up and blocked it, nullifying Gongsun Yuntian’s attack.

“What’s that?”

The prodigies of the Gongsun Clan were stunned by that sight.

“Were you the one who did it?” Gongsun Yuntian asked Chu Feng grimly.

“You won’t be able to enter this cavern,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Is it the effect of the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl? If I’m not mistaken, even if you managed to obtain the pearl and grasp the energy inside the cavern, you should only be able to use the energy when you’re inside the cavern,” Gongsun Yuntian said with a frown.

“You’re right. Indeed, I can only use this energy inside the cavern. If you don’t enter the cavern, there’s nothing much I can do about you. But similarly, you can’t do anything to us either,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re a tortoise! I don’t believe that you can hole yourself in there for all eternity!” A prodigy of the Gongsun Clan pointed his finger at Chu Feng and taunted.

“If you wish to wait it out with me, I’m more than willing to play the game with you. I have plenty of time anyway. We can just wait till the trial is over and the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace vanishes.

“It’s just that the Gongsun Clan has sent seven of its prodigies in here. If all seven of them were to fail, I wonder how the others would view the Gongsun Clan. Even I can’t help worrying on your behalf!”

Chu Feng shrugged his shoulders casually.

“Heh...”

Yet, Gongsun Yuntian suddenly let out a cold sneer. He didn’t get mad at all, and there weren’t any signs of fluster on his face.

“Chu Feng, why don’t you have a good look at who this is?”

Gongsun Yuntian took out a bag from his Cosmos Sack and tossed it to one side. Surprisingly, a figure rolled out from the bag.

This figure was bound by chains made out of a formation, and her body was inflicted with glaring injuries.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng and Xia Yan were still able to identify who he was. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Xiao Yu?”

Both Chu Feng and Xia Yan were astonished. They didn’t think that Xiao Yu would end up falling into Gongsun Yuntian’s hands.

“Chu Feng, our enmity should just stay between the two of us. It has nothing much to do with your two companions. If you walk out of the cavern on your own accord, I’ll let the two of them go,” Gongsun Yuntian said.

“Heh...”

Xiao Yu suddenly burst into laughter upon hearing those words.

“Gongsun Yuntian, did water get into your brain? I am nothing more than an acquaintance to Chu Feng, and there’s barely a bond between us. We only joined hands earlier due to the dire circumstances. Yet, you want to use me as a chip to coerce Chu Feng to walk to his death? Do you even think that’s possible?” Xiao Yu looked at Gongsun Yuntian in disdain.

“True. I also don’t think that he would have the guts to give up his own life. Since that’s the case, all of you are worthless to me. I suppose I should get rid of things that are worthless, right?”

Gongsun Yuntian raised his hand, prepared to end Xiao Yu’s life. But before he could land the final blow, he suddenly froze in place. Then, he turned to look in the direction of the cavern.

The other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan quickly gazed over as well, and they, too, were shocked by what they saw.

Chu Feng had walked out of the cavern voluntarily and was now standing at its entrance.

He actually chose to leave the safety of the cavern for Xiao Yu’s sake!

“Chu Feng, why are you so foolish? Head back in! Even if you walk out, there’s no way that he’ll let me off!” Xiao Yu howled furiously.

Weng!

However, barely after Xiao Yu said those words, a burst of energy sealed off the path behind Chu Feng.

Needless to say, it was Gongsun Yuntian’s doing. He was probably worried that Chu Feng would return back into the cavern, so he chose to seal off the latter’s path of escape first.

“Gongsun Yuntian, are you a man? If you’re a man, fulfill the end of your promise!” Chu Feng spat.

“Chu Feng, it looks like you aren’t as smart as your own allies. Toward someone like you, why should I hold my promise? You want to play the hero and save him? Very well, I shall snap his neck right in front of you then!”

Gongsun Yuntian wasn’t joking here. He was really prepared to end Xiao Yu’s life.

Shoosh!

Yet, at this critical moment, a figure suddenly appeared right between Gongsun Yuntian and Xiao Yu. It was Chu Feng.

Chu Feng raised his hand to block off Gongsun Yuntian’s attack before gripping his wrist tightly.

“You!!!”

Seeing how Chu Feng actually managed to block Gongsun Yuntian’s attack, everyone present jolted in astonishment.

One must know that Gongsun Yuntian was a world spiritist who had grasped rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, making him equivalent to a rank one Martial Exalted cultivator. It was unthinkable to them that Chu Feng would actually be able to overpower him in a direct confrontation.

But little did they know that this was not all Chu Feng had prepared.

Chu Feng suddenly tightened his grip, and Gongsun Yuntian’s wrist suddenly snapped just like that.

“You bastard!!!!”

The infuriated Gongsun Yuntian howled furiously as he channeled a massive surge of spirit power toward Chu Feng, attempting to overpower the latter and destroy him.

But before his gush of spirit power could strike Chu Feng, the latter suddenly raised his fist and smashed it into Gongsun Yuntian’s face, causing the latter to tumble on the ground before knocking onto the wall. His face was so mashed up that it was hard to discern how he originally looked like.

“This...”

The prodigies of the Gongsun Clan hurriedly rushed to Gongsun Yuntian’s side. The plight that befell Gongsun Yuntian felt like a prophecy of what that was going to happen to them next, and it frightened them.

“Let me tell you a secret. In truth, I knew right from the start that you were here. Do you know why I didn’t expose you?

“That’s because you lot are nothing more than mere ants to me.”

Chu Feng told the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.

Those words brought nervousness, fear, and panic onto the faces of the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, as they stared at Chu Feng as if he was a monster tyrannizing them.

While they did know that Chu Feng was stronger than they initially assumed, they didn’t think that he would actually wield such great power. Even Gongsun Yuntian wasn’t a match for him at all!

They thought that Chu Feng was a goner now that he had fallen into their hands, but as it turned out, they were the helpless goats who had ran right into the mouth of a tiger!
