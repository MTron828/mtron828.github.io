Chapter 2728 - Astonishing Everyone

“An exceptional demon-level genius, this Chu feng is most definitely an exceptional demon-level genius!”

“Otherwise, how could he possibly be able to make all those weapons resonate with him?!”

Cries of alarm sounded from the crowd. Soon, the entire crowd of people burst into an uproar.

Even the people from the Immortal Armament Villa reacted with endless astonishment.

“Lord Villa Master, that Chu Feng is truly extraordinary,” The fiery red-haired old man said to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master with an excited expression on his face.

“That child is indeed amazing,” At that moment, even the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was unable to keep himself from praising Chu Feng.

“Little friend Chu Feng is truly extraordinary. Since all of the Incomplete Immortal Armaments in the Immortal Armament Armory have resonated with you, you are now able to choose any of those weapons you like.”

“Regardless of which one you might choose, as long as you are fond of them, they will be yours,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

“Lord Villa Master, may I continue onward?” Chu Feng asked faintly.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you wish to proceed to the second level?” At that moment, even the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master revealed a surprised expression.

“Truth be told, this junior does not have much interest in Incomplete Immortal Armaments. I have chosen to enter the Immortal Armament Armory precisely to see if I can make an Immortal Armament resonate with me,” Chu Feng said.

“Little friend Chu Feng, I would urge you to give up that thought. After you enter the second level, what you will be challenging will be Immortal Armaments.”

“Thus, even though you’ve managed to make all of the Incomplete Immortal Armaments in the first level resonate with you, you will be giving them up the moment you enter the second level.”

“You will have to start afresh. With that, whether or not you will be able to obtain a harvest will be dependent on whether or not any of the Immortal Armaments on the second level will resonate with you.”

“This old man can tell you with certainty that Immortal Armaments are not that easy.”

“Even though you’ve managed to cause all of the Incomplete Immortal Armaments on the first floor to resonate with you, it is very possible that not a single Immortal Armament on the second floor will resonate with you,” Right at that moment, the fiery red-haired old man urged Chu Feng against it.

“Why didn’t you all mention this rule beforehand?” Chu Feng asked.

At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said, “It was this old man’s negligence. I never expected little friend Chu Feng to be so courageous as to actually plan to challenge the Immortal Armaments.”

“However, what Elder Tuoba says is the truth. This is actually something that many of the people present know about too. Our Immortal Armament Villa would definitely not deceive little friend Chu Feng.”

“That is indeed the case. Young Hero Chu Feng, Lord Villa Master is not lying to you.”

At that moment, many of the somewhat renowned experts from the older generation began to vouch for the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

Many others also started to echo their words.

From the reactions of the crowd, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master had not lied to him.

That rule seemed to actually exist.

“Eggy, what do you think about this? Do you think I should continue onward?”

Chu Feng did not immediately decide what to do. Instead, he asked Her Lady Queen for her opinion.

“The way I see it, the Immortal Armament Villa is willing to present any of the Incomplete Immortal Armaments to you. However, when it comes to actual Immortal Armaments, they would not be willing to part with them. If you insist on going up, they will inevitably try to do something.”

“After all, this is merely a spirit formation, and not the actual Immortal Armament Armory. As for spirit formations, they are generally capable of being controlled,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Eggy, you are thinking exactly what I’m thinking. If I insist on going up, it is very possible that I will return empty-handed.”

“However, if I do not go up, I will be able to choose any one Incomplete Immortal Armament,” Chu Feng said.

“However, that Dragon Phoenix Silver Stream that Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master took out earlier was already a top quality Incomplete Immortal Armament.”

“While there is no lack of top quality Incomplete Immortal Armaments on the first level, you will, at the very most, only be able to select an Incomplete Immortal Armament on par with the Dragon Phoenix Silver Stream. You will definitely not be able to find an Incomplete Immortal Armament of higher quality than it.”

“Furthermore, your current Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler is also not inferior in quality to that Dragon Phoenix Silver Stream.”

“Thus, even though there are risks, this Queen still thinks that you should attempt it,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Very well. I will listen to what my Eggy says,” Chu Feng said with a serious expression.

“Pah! Who’s yours?” Her Lady Queen rolled her eyes.

Chu Feng ignored Her Lady Queen’s eye roll. He acted as if he didn’t see it at all, and looked immensely self-satisfied. It was as if he had truly taken cheap advantage of Her Lady Queen.

“I, Chu Feng, am willing to continue challenging this palace,” At that moment, with a smile on his face, Chu Feng spoke to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

“Very well. Little friend Chu Feng, you are truly deserving of praise for your courage. Since that’s the case, we will wait and see what you can accomplish.”

“I hope that you will be able to cause the second level’s Immortal Armaments to resonate with you too,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

At that moment, Chu Feng walked up to the Immortal Armament Armory’s second level. Apart from a stairway, a gate also separated the first and second levels.

When Chu Feng arrived before the gate to the second level, that simple and unadorned gate immediately opened for him.

With that, Chu Feng directly set foot into the second level.

When Chu Feng entered the second level, he felt an enlightened sensation.

Although he clearly knew that the weapons there were fake, the auras that they were emitting were so very real.

Sure enough, Immortal Armaments were not something that Incomplete Immortal Armaments could compare to. This was like the comparison between a true dragon and a flood dragon.

The Immortal Armaments were all emittings airs of a ruler.

At that moment... close to a thousand Immortal Armaments were all present in the same place. The oppressive sensation that they emitted was stifling, even for Chu Feng.

As for that, it also indirectly revealed how formidable Immortal Armaments were.

“Doesn’t seem good.”

At that moment, Her Lady Queen was also very nervous. She was no longer sitting leisurely in the world spirit space.

Instead, she had stood up. Furthermore, her beautiful eyes were flickering nonstop. A worried expression filled her eyes.

The reason for that was because after Chu Feng entered the second level, besides having not a single Immortal Armament from the second level resonate with him, they didn’t even let out the slightest bit of sound.

“As expected from Immortal Armaments. Even a demon-level genius like Chu Feng will not be able to cause them to resonate.”

“It would appear that little friend Chu Feng is going to return empty-handed.”

“So what? He was able to cause all of the Incomplete Immortal Armaments on the first level to resonate with him. That has already proved how amazing little friend Chu Feng is.”

“With how powerful and valiant Immortal Armaments are, even if they did not resonate with him, it is not humiliating either.”

“That’s true. Little friend Chu Feng has already proved his talent. That is something that no one can deny.”

At that moment, the crowd started to spiritedly discuss the situation. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Although the crowd were all in agreement that Chu Feng was a genius, they all felt that Chu Feng would end up returning empty-handed.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right at that moment, a tremble sounded from the Immortal Armament Armory’s second level.

It turned out that Chu Feng had not given up. He had walked to the end of the second level.

A tremble sounded from the far end.

“It’s this weapon?”

At that moment, Chu Feng was overjoyed. Being inside the Immortal Armament Armory’s second floor, he was able to clearly hear where the trembling was coming from.
