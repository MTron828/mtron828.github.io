Chapter 4020 - What Happened Back Then

“It’s not that I didn’t want to go and find you all. It’s just that I returned to the Reincarnation Upper Realm after being separated from you on the Path to Heaven.”

“Once I returned to the Reincarnation Upper Realm, I recovered my lost memories. At the same time... I ended up losing some of my memories.”

“I’... completely forgotten about you and Wang Qiang,” said Zhao Hong.

After hearing Zhao Hong’s narration, Chu Feng gained a rough understanding of what had happened back then.

It turned out that, many years ago, back when Zhao Hong’s name had still resounded throughout the All-heaven Starfield, the Reincarnation Sect had prepared a Reincarnation Ceremony for her.

Thus, even if the All-heaven Sect had not attacked the Reincarnation Sect, Zhao Hong would still reincarnate.

The reason for that was because the Reincarnation Ceremony would allow Zhao Hong to obtain the power of the Reincarnation Pearl, to receive the legendary Reincarnation Divine Body that would greatly increase her power.

Unfortunately, the assault from the All-heaven Sect and Liu Shuo’s plot ended up causing disastrous damage to the Reincarnation Sect, and had seriously injured Zhao Hong. Because of that, they ended up having no choice but to start the Reincarnation Ceremony ahead of time.

As the preparations for the ceremony were still not complete, Zhao Hong’s decision to forcibly obtain rebirth caused an error to occur in the ceremony.

Zhao Hong was not reborn in the designated location. She ended up being reborn in the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

According to their plan, Han Xiu and the other surviving experts of the Reincarnation Sect would seek out Zhao Hong at their designated location.

If they failed to find her at the designated location, it would mean that the Reincarnation Ceremony had most likely failed.

As for what happened afterwards, Chu Feng knew all about it.

After being reborn in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Zhao Hong lost all memory of her previous life.

The only thing that remained, was her deep hatred for men. That hatred had turned her into a homicidal demoness.

She had been notorious in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Before her cultivation could be restored, she had been killed by experts of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm multiple times.

Fortunately she possessed the Reincarnation Pearl, which allowed her to be reborn repeatedly.

“Thus, after you recovered the memories of your past, you began to plan your revenge.”

“As for everything that Han Xiu prepared, it was all for your sake?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng actually knew that Han Xiu’s decision to obtain the YinYang Soulsealing Rope from the Mystic Cave Saints without regard for what the price might be must have been for Zhao Hong’s sake.

Even her later request to Chu Feng to refine materials related to souls must have been done for Zhao Hong’s sake.

She’d done all of that so that Zhao Hong could recover her power.

“Mn.”

“Xiu’er has been loyal and devoted to me the entire time.”

“Actually, since she’d become the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster. She, with her status, simply didn’t need to risk her life for my sake.”

“However, the moment she saw me, she decided to disregard everything to help.”

Zhao Hong felt moved when Han Xiu was mentioned.

There were also other survivors from the Reincarnation Sect. Yet, for the sake of protecting themselves, those people had all concealed their identities and had gone into hiding.

Yet, Han Xiu was able to remain faithful and true to Zhao Hong. Such behavior was indeed capable of moving one emotionally.

After all, the moment Han Xiu had decided to assist Zhao Hong, she had decided to give up on everything she owned to contend against the strongest power in the All-heaven Starfield.

She would be putting her life on the line to aid Zhao Hong.

“In that case, when did you recover your memories? When did you remember Wang Qiang and I?” asked Chu Feng.

“I’ve always have faint memories about you and Wang Qiang. It’s merely that I was unable to remember those things clearly. It was like all those memories were a dream.”

“Later on, when Xiu’er was helping me condense my soul, I had her add some materials capable of helping one recover one’s memories into the materials.”

“As such, once my soul was successfully condensed, I recovered the memories I had of you and Wang Qiang.”

“I had originally planned to find the two of you after taking care of Liu Shuo and the All-heaven Sect. Never did I expect to find you in the All-heaven Starfield. Furthermore, you even saved my life,” said Zhao Hong.

“Saved your life? It was clearly you who saved my life,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Although I managed to complete the ceremony to greatly increase my cultivation with Xiu’er’s help, things were not perfect.”

“Because of that, I’ve not obtained the true Reincarnation Divine Body. The ceremony only increased my cultivation and battle power.”

“If I haddn’t discovered that the person risking his life to save me was you, I don’t believe that I wouldn’t have suddenly awakened the power within me and gained a breakthrough in cultivation.”

“As such, it’s you who saved me.”

Zhao Hong looked at Chu Feng again. Gratitude appeared in her eyes. Even her tone was very grateful.

She knew very well that if Chu Feng hadn’t come to her aid, she would not have been a match for Liu Shuo, and would’ve died in battle with Han Xiu.

“And here I thought you had kept a trump card up your sleeve. Turns out, it was actually an unexpected breakthrough,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

He was joking with Zhao Hong. He naturally knew that it was a last minute breakthrough.

He knew very well that Zhao Hong would not have allowed herself to suffer like that had she had such power from the very start. She also wouldn’t have made him suffer either, since she would’ve been able to take care of the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster from the very start.

Chu Feng had only decided to joke around to ease the atmosphere, because he saw that Zhao Hong’s expression had suddenly turned serious.

“Tsk, you’re still so garrulous.”

Zhao Hong rolled her eyes at Chu Feng.

However, the corners of her lips rose into a sweet smile.

After all, such a Chu Feng was the one she was most familiar with.

Even though Zhao Hong used to shine brilliantly in the Reincarnation Upper Realm, she had lived her life very uncomfortably at that time.

High hopes and heavy responsibilities had been placed on her from the moment of her birth.

She even needed to be cautious when making friends. She had no freedom at all.

As for after she was reincarnated into the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, her days as the demoness were also extremely miserable.

It was only after she encountered Chu Feng and Wang Qiang that her life changed completely.

The risks they took, the friendship they had, the life they lived, those became the most pleasant memories in her heart.

“Oh, that’s right. You mentioned that you didn’t obtain the Reincarnation Divine Body. Are you lacking something in the ceremony, or did something go wrong?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.

“Yes, I was lacking an item -- the Reincarnation Pearl.”

“Even though the Reincarnation Ceremony had already assimilated the power of the Reincarnation Pearl into my body, remnants of its power still remained in the Reincarnation Pearl. As such, the reincarnation power within my body is incomplete.”

“Only by finding the Reincarnation Pearl and assimilating the remnants of its power into my body can I gain the complete Reincarnation Divine Body,” said Zhao Hong.

“I know who took the Reincarnation Pearl,” said Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had learned of Zhao Hong’s origin from that plain-clothed monk.

After telling Chu Feng of Zhao Hong’s origin, the plain-clothed monk had removed Zhao Hong’s Reincarnation Pearl.

He’d taken away Zhao Hong’s Reincarnation Pearl so that she would not be reborn again, so that she would no longer sin. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

At that time, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were enemies. Thus, he did not stop the plain-clothed monk, and was instead very grateful for his actions.

However, upon thinking about it, Chu Feng felt some regret.

“I know who took it,” said Zhao Hong.

“You know too?” Chu Feng felt surprised. After all, Zhao Hong had not been present back then.

Furthermore, Chu Feng had never mentioned the matter to her before.

Thus, he thought that Zhao Hong didn’t know about this.

“Of course I do.”

“How else do you think he knew about me?” Zhao Hong said with a faint smile.

“It would appear that you still have more secrets. Why don’t you tell me exactly what is going on?”

Chu Feng had realized that the relationship between the plain-clothed monk and Zhao Hong seemed to not be simple at all.

The plain-clothed monk taking away Zhao Hong’s Reincarnation Pearl very possibly also had something to do with her.

That said, Chu Feng was unable to determine exactly what was going on. As such, he was rather curious.
