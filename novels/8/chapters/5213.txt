Chapter 5213: The True Godsoul

Boom!

There was a sudden piercing explosion, and the hall began to shake. This abrupt situation alarmed Eggy, and she immediately set her golden aura ablaze once more.

She thought that there were other world spirits in the hall.

However, when she took a look around, she realized that the noise was caused by the collapse of a wall.

The wall was so massive that it formed a massive mountain of glass shards even after it had collapsed.

“Is that the Godsoul? It’s massive. It looks like I’m the final victor here. I didn’t expect it to be that easy.”

Due to the obstruction of the glass mountain, the first thing Eggy noticed was the humongous Godsoul. Shortly after, she sensed Chu Feng’s aura in the vicinity. She quickly rose into the air and flew over to the adjacent hall.

“Is Chu Feng attempting to breach the formation?”

Even though there were two formations in front of the Godsoul, Eggy was still able to tell which one Chu Feng was in.

“The formation feels incredibly dangerous. He really doesn’t listen to me. Didn’t I tell him that I forbid him from taking risks?” Eggy murmured angrily.

Despite her angry tone, she could hardly conceal the worry in her eyes. Despite having the Godsoul right in front of her, her eyes were fixated on Chu Feng’s formation, not moving in the least.

“Stinky Chu Feng, you have to come out alive!”

Eggy clenched her fists tightly out of nervousness.

Boom!

The Godsoul suddenly began trembling intensely.

The formation Chu Feng was in emanated a mysterious light filled with innumerable runes. These were the profoundness of the formation. The runes slowly drifted toward the formation that had sealed off the Godsoul, slowly unraveling it.

Weng!

Everything in the hall seemed to disappear, be it Chu Feng or the formations. Even the hall itself disappeared. Instead, Eggy found herself standing in the midst of the vast cosmos, surrounded by countless stars and realms. She couldn’t help but feel insignificant when faced with such vastness.

Something else had been brought along with her into this vast cosmos—the Godsoul.

The Godsoul had expanded to a hulking size completely unlike what it was before. Even massive realms that contained billions of lives looked no more than a speck of dust before it.

Words couldn’t begin to describe what a magnificent sight it was.

There was no need for the Godsoul to display its power at all. Just its presence itself was the greatest proof of its strength.

It was fortunate that it was just a power and not a living being, or else it could have obliterated countless realms with just a mere movement.

“Interesting. I wouldn’t expect anything less from one of the Nine Great Godsouls of the world of cultivation.”

Eggy wasn’t intimidated by the sheer size of the Godsoul at all. Instead, her eyes glowed with excitement.

Weng!

All of a sudden, the Godsoul condensed itself into a ray of light that shot straight into Eggy’s forehead, packing its immenseness into an incomparably smaller being.

A small imprint was left on Eggy’s forehead after she took in the entire Godsoul. This imprint had an unusual design, but there was a peculiar sense of aesthetics in it. It didn’t mar her beauty at all; if anything, it only added an air of mystery around her.

However, Eggy wasn’t in the mind to fuss about the change in her appearance. How could she when the Godsoul was now inside of her?

“Amazing! Such a massive Godsoul was actually able to condense itself into me? If I could gain full control over this power, I’d be able to reach an unbelievable level. I would be unmatched in the Asura Spirit World!”

Eggy was so delighted that she could hardly close her mouth, especially when she could feel just how powerful the Godsoul was. The only caveat was that she was unable to tap into it at the moment. In fact, there wasn’t even the slightest connection between her and the Godsoul.

One could say that her head was currently nothing more than a container for the Godsoul to dwell in.

It was similar to the situation back when Chu Feng had nine enormous lightning beasts inside his dantian. He could sense how powerful those lightning beasts were, but he was unable to use them.

That being said, there was a subtle difference between the two cases here.

While Chu Feng was unable to tap into the power of the lightning beasts, the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor they had bestowed upon him still played a huge role in his current strength.

On the other hand, the Godsoul didn’t bestow anything upon Eggy despite the tremendous power it harnessed. She didn’t gain anything just by having the Godsoul inside of her.

“Eggy?” Chu Feng called out.

Upon hearing the voice, Eggy’s surroundings started to change once more. Her consciousness receded from the vast cosmos and returned to the hall, where she found Chu Feng standing in front of her.

He was no longer in the formation anymore.

“Chu Feng, I have obtained the Godsoul. It’s right here. You’re incredible, Chu Feng. It’s all thanks to you that I was able to obtain the Godsoul!”

Eggy excitedly shared the news with Chu Feng as she pointed at her forehead.

“Is that imprint on your forehead the Godsoul? Why isn’t there any change in your cultivation then? Do you need to assimilate or comprehend the Godsoul first?” Chu Feng asked.

He had a sense of just how powerful the Godsoul was, though it wasn’t as vivid as what Eggy had just experienced. He thought that it didn’t make sense how Eggy was still at the same cultivation level even after taking in something as formidable as that.

The only possibility he could think of was that she hadn’t fully assimilated it yet, similar to the Sacred Tree Seed inside of him.

While the Sacred Tree Seed was unlikely to be stronger than the Godsoul, Chu Feng had a feeling that it was nothing to be made light of either. Otherwise, it didn’t make sense how the incomparably powerful enormous lightning beasts were unable to defeat the Sacred Tree Seed.

Speaking of which, it had been a long time since the enormous lightning beasts had made a move on the Sacred Tree Seed. This was excellent news, considering how Chu Feng would be affected whenever they got into a fight.

“I’m not too sure either. I’ll have to look into it. How are you? Are you injured?” Eggy asked worriedly.

Despite having just obtained a treasure as formidable as the Godsoul, she wasn’t in the mood to research it right away. Instead, she began carefully examining Chu Feng’s body to check for injuries. She was so meticulous that it almost seemed as if she was worried that she would miss out on a single injury on him.

“Milady Queen, it’s weirdly embarrassing when you examine my body like that,” Chu Feng said jokingly.

.

Eggy had gone ahead to tug at Chu Feng’s clothes to peek inside, not showing the slightest hint of reservation at all.

“Hah! I’ve already seen everything that’s to be seen,” Eggy replied disdainfully.

However, her lips soon curled up in relief as she confirmed that Chu Feng was uninjured.

“It’s good that you’re unharmed,” Eggy said. “Speaking of which, I met Xue Ji earlier.”

“Did you defeat Xue Ji?” Chu Feng asked.

Considering how Xue Ji wasn’t in the vicinity and the fact that Eggy had acquired the Godsoul, he deduced that she was the last one standing amongst the world spirits.

“I didn’t defeat her. She surrendered on her own accord,” Eggy replied.

“She surrendered? She didn’t even try to compete with you?”

Chu Feng was surprised to hear that.

“That’s right,” Eggy replied with a nod.
