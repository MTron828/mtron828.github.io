Chapter 5750: Little Fishy Challenges Jie Tian

“A good show awaits us!”

The crowd was excited by Jie Tian’s arrival.

Qin Xuan and Qin Shu, who could only roam in the square after losing access to their residences, had been feeling frustrated for a while now. They wanted to get back at Chu Feng, so they had been waiting for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to make their appearance.

Yet, despite the grand entrance of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, the five Huangfus were disinterested and even turned around to take their leave.

“Hold it right there!” Jie Tian coldly uttered.

“Are you talking to me?” the white-haired man asked. His eyes were still filled with contempt even though he was faced with the prodigies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“I heard you came to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith solely to meet Chu Feng?” Jie Tian asked.

“That’s right, but there’s nothing for me to look forward to now,” the white-haired man replied.

“What about our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Jie Tian asked.

The white-haired man burst into laughter. “Mere world spiritists. Not worth my attention.”

Boom!

Tremendous spirit power with might comparable to a rank eight Half-God level cultivator gushed from Jie Tian toward the white-haired man. Jie Tian had reached Exalted Dragon God-cloak.

Tzlala!

The attack was stopped before it could reach the white-haired man.

Of the five Huangfus, the man with an average appearance had stepped forward to stop the attack. He had manifested the Lightning Mark and the Lightning Armor, raising his cultivation to rank eight Half-God level. This meant that his base cultivation was rank six Half-God level.

“Hmph!” Jie Tian harrumphed.

Without any warning, his spirit power exploded. He had concealed a formation in that gush of spirit power. The explosion was so powerful that it knocked back the average-looking man.

“You’re courting death!”

The average-looking man was unharmed, but his face warped with murderous intent as he grabbed the black-colored, wooden box from his back.

“Stop,” the white-haired man ordered.

“I can see that you’re indignant. Don’t worry, I’ll convince you. None of you will be feeling that way very soon,” the white-haired man said with a contemptuous smile before taking his leave.

The other four Huangfus followed him.

“I didn’t think that Jie Tian would be at Exalted Dragon God-cloak! Ling Xiao was previously at Immortal Dragon God-cloak, right? If he hasn’t made a breakthrough yet, it would mean that Jie Tian has already surpassed him.”

“As expected of Jie Mubai and Jie Tiannian’s son, the grandson of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. I’d say that Jie Tian is the real deal rather than Chu Feng.”

“Those Huangfus are amazing too. Those two who revealed their cultivation are at rank six Half-God level. I didn’t expect them to possess the Heavenly Bloodline too. They must have been from a powerful Heavenly Clan. Why have I never heard of them before? They must have hidden themselves well.”

The crowd was impressed by both Jie Tian and the five Huangfus.

Soon, Chu Feng emerged from the white fog. They were planning to look for Wang Qiang, but the latter didn’t respond to their calls, so they were unable to enter his residence.

“Chu Feng! You really dared to come here!”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s juniors glared at Chu Feng with murderous eyes that made it clear that they wouldn’t hesitate to tear them into shreds if they got the chance to do so. Jie Tian, on the other hand, was surprisingly composed as he looked at Chu Feng.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Chu Feng, are you going to surrender, or do I have to apprehend you?” Jie Tian asked.

“Just try touching him, Jie Tian!” Little Fishy growled.

Jie Tian formed a hand seal and conjured countless formation swords with his spirit power. He changed his hand seal, and the formation swords immediately rushed at Chu Feng.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh.

Xian Miaomiao, Little Fishy, and Feng Ling stepped forward to shield Chu Feng. All three of them raised their cultivation ranks while exerting their martial power to block Jie Tian’s attack.

After dealing with that wave of attack, Xian Miaomiao and Feng Ling stayed beside Chu Feng, while Little Fishy charged at Jie Tian.

A blue aura flowed around Little Fishy’s body, as her eyes turned blue like the deep ocean. Through the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s bloodline power, she raised her cultivation to rank eight Half-God level, which was how she was able to deflect Jie Tian’s barrage of formation swords.

Before Little Fishy could reach Jie Tian, she was stopped by an even more powerful barrier. This barrier was too powerful to have come from Jie Tian.

“Benefactor Jie Tian, why did you make a move on Chu Feng?” Liu Kuo’s voice echoed as he entered the square. He was the one who had activated the barrier to stop Little Fishy’s attack.

“He dared to challenge our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Someone like him deserves to die a thousand times over,” Jie Tian said.

“You’re the one who deserves to die,” Little Fishy furiously retorted.

Jie Tian turned to Little Fishy and said, “Xianhai Yu’er, do you think you can protect Chu Feng? This isn’t the Immemorial Star Sea. Without the formation armor, neither of you stand a chance against me.”

“They know each other?”

“Immemorial Star Sea?”

“Could the name that previously appeared in the Immemorial Star Sea be Jie Tian’s?”

The crowd could tell from Jie Tian and Little Fishy’s conversation that they were previously met at the Immemorial Star Sea. This reminded them of the peculiarities that had happened there.

“You must have forgotten that the two of you have already crossed blows in the Immemorial Star Sea? You lost to Little Fishy,” Chu Feng said.

“What does Chu Feng’s words mean? Xianhai Yu’er has already crossed blows with Jie Tian?”

The crowd was curious to know who was stronger, Jie Tian or Xianhai Yu’er. They were here to decide the strongest junior in the world of cultivation, after all.

Unfazed by Chu Feng’s remark, Jie Tian replied, “Chu Feng, you’re trash that hides behind a woman’s back. Your words hold no credibility.”

He wasn’t planning to admit to the fact that he had once lost to Little Fishy.

Chu Feng chuckled upon hearing those words.

Little Fishy leaped onto the dueling ring before she turned to Jie Tian and said, “Come up.”

“You wish to make a fool out of yourself?” Jie Tian asked.

“The loser should kill themself,” Little Fishy said.

“Little Fishy, there’s no need to go that far,” Chu Feng said.

It was not to say that he didn’t have confidence in Little Fishy’s strength, but Jie Tian was not a pushover either. Little Fishy might have won against Jie Tian in the future, but he didn’t want her to risk her life on such a bet.
