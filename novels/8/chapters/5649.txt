Chapter 5649: The Mysterious Giant Door

“Come with me,” Fu Xing said as she rushed ahead.

Chu Feng quickly followed her as he asked, “Miss Fu, you seem awfully certain that there’s no danger lying ahead of us.”

He had deduced this based on how fast Fu Xing was traveling. It was unlikely for her to be so careless unless she had prior information about the road ahead. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“There’s a palace at the edge of the desert, and the path I’m taking there is a safe one. Inside the palace, you’ll be restricted to only using your spirit power. There’s a purple ferocious beast inside the palace that we should be able to deal with together. Once we defeat it, the spirit formation gate at the other end of the palace will open. That’s the exit out of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.

“There is also another door in the palace where a black ferocious beast lurks. Its strength is set to be at our strongest fighting prowess. How strong is your spirit power?” Fu Xing asked.

“I am a Golden Dragon God-cloak, but I should be able to rival Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists in a battle. In terms of just formations, I can construct formations comparable to that of an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist,” Chu Feng replied.

Fu Xing looked at Chu Feng with conflicted eyes. There were many things she wanted to say, but she held herself back and resumed the earlier topic.

“The black ferocious beast in there should be at Royal Dragon God-cloak. You’ll obtain a black fruit if you defeat it, and its effects are bound to be better than the purple fruit. Furthermore, the palace may contain the true secret behind the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.

“However, I should warn you that even Lord Jie Ranqing was unable to defeat the black ferocious beast back then, so you can imagine just how dangerous it is. You may surrender if you don’t wish to challenge it, but I’m planning to fight it,” Fu Xing said.

“How can I give up when I’m after the Saint-tier treasure? But Miss Fu Xing, how do you know so much? Are you from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Chu Feng asked in curiosity.

“I am not from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but my clues are from a trustworthy source. It’s been proven along the way,” Fu Xing said.

“All right.” Chu Feng didn’t harp on the matter, seeing how she was reluctant to share about it.

Since Jie Ranqing had shared the insights she had arrived at with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, there was bound to be the possibility of an information leak. It was not impossible for Fu Xing to know about the content despite not being from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng’s eyes lit up, and he slowed his footsteps. Before him was a gigantic stone door that was fifty thousand meters in width, and a hundred thousand meters in height. This door was so resilient that he couldn’t shake it at all despite its relatively small size.

“There’s something special about this door. You may take a closer look,” Fu Xing said as she slowed her footsteps too.

“Miss Fu, do you know more about this door?” Chu Feng asked. He could tell that this door was something formidable though he didn’t know about its background.

“Not at all; I only know that this door is nigh indestructible. I have examined the door, and the patterns on its surface contain enlightenment about world spiritist techniques. However, it’s so profound that I’m unable to grasp it,” Fu Xing replied.

Chu Feng tried examining the door as well, hoping to decipher its secret since he knew that it was anything but simple, but he quickly realized that the current him didn’t have the capability to do so. Thus, he turned to Fu Xing and asked, “I heard Lord Jie Ranqing spent many years deciphering the secret surrounding the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Does the secret include this door as well?”

“I suppose so, but I can’t be certain about that. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master is the only one who has Lord Jie Ranqing’s full analysis about the Nine Realms Secret Domain,” Fu Xing replied. “How is it? Are you able to see through it?”

“I don’t think so,” Chu Feng replied.

“Let’s move on first,” Fu Xing said before walking away.

The two of them soon arrived at a palace, but the palace was different from what Chu Feng had imagined. It was humongous, with its roof reaching the clouds. It was more like a mountain range rather than a palace. A massive barrier sealed off the area around it.

It felt as if they had arrived at the edge of the world.

Chu Feng walked up to the palace to examine its doors. Its doors were massive and nigh indestructible too, but somehow, it looked much less imposing than the stone doors they had stumbled upon earlier.

It only further highlighted how extraordinary the stone doors were.

“Is the purple ferocious beast lying beyond this door?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right,” Fu Xing replied with a nod.

“How many are they?”

“I don’t know.”

“Forget it. I’ll decipher the formation. You make preparations,” Chu Feng said as he began breaching the formation.

“Have you already seen through the formation?” Fu Xing was taken aback. She had been examining the formation too, but she hadn’t fully deciphered it yet.

Weng!

Chu Feng completed a deciphering formation that fused impeccably with the doors. With a loud rumble, the humongous palace doors creaked open.
