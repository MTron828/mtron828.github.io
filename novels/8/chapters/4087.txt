Chapter 4087 - Li Mengyue

“Roar~~~”

Suddenly, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master let out a loud roar.

Heaven and earth trembled with the roar. Visible sound waves emerged from his mouth and swept violently toward Chu Feng.

Enveloped by the sound wave, Chu Feng’s giant dragon of light began to crumble.

The giant light dragon that was able to suppress a rank two Exalted Taboo was destroyed in the blink of an eye.

Ravaged by the might of the sound wave, Chu Feng, although not injured, was forced back repeatedly.

That said, the sound wave that landed on Chu Feng was merely the remnants that had destroyed the giant light dragon.

This made the crowd realize one thing -- no matter how strong Chu Feng’s battle power might be, he was still unable to contend against the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

“Terrifying!”

“Is that the power of Demonization?”

“Although his cultivation is still that of a rank four Utmost Exalted, his battle power is already infinitely close to that of a rank five Utmost Exalted, no?”

Looks of sympathy appeared in the crowd’s eyes as they looked to Chu Feng again.

“Chu Feng shouldn’t have forced the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master into a corner. That man is simply a rabid dog. He’s so crazy that he’s determined to pull Chu Feng down with him even in death.”

“Pity. This is truly a pity. Must a genius like that really fall here?”

Practically everyone felt that Chu Feng was doomed.

Faced with the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master, Chu Feng simply had no chance of survival.

“Brat, I’ll have you die!”

The Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master spoke again. The tone that he spoke with had changed enormously.

His voice no longer sounded human at all.

That voice was even more terrifying than a beast’s voice.

After he finished saying those words, he waved his arm toward the sky.

“Boom~~~”

A dark black sword ray was released from his arm.

That sword ray measured ten thousand meters long. As it swept through the air, it split through everything in its path. With a might seemingly capable of obliterating everything, it rushed to attack Chu Feng.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right when the black sword ray was about to reach Chu Feng, it suddenly dissipated into thin air.

No, to be exact, that sword ray had encountered a power stronger than itself. It was that power that had forcibly cancelled out the sword ray.

“Could it be that Chu Feng is able to take on even the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master?”

The crowd looked to Chu Feng with eyes filled with shock.

“It’s you?”

However, to their surprise, even Chu Feng had a look of shock on his face.

The only difference between Chu Feng and the crowd was the direction that their shocked eyes were looking at.

For the crowd, they were looking at Chu Feng. But Chu Feng was looking directly ahead.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the space before Chu Feng began to squirm. Then, a figure appeared before him.

It was a woman.

She was the female elder tasked to enter the Purple Star Variance Realm with Chu Feng.

“It’s her?”

Many people outside were surprised to see that female elder.

This was especially true for the people from the Purple Star Hall.

In fact, after seeing the appearance of that female elder, even the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master was greatly shocked.

Because of that, he turned his gaze to Pang Youyang, the Supreme Elder standing behind him, and asked, “Why is she in there?”

“Lord Hall master, I... I also have no idea.”

Pang Youyang also had a look of confusion.

It turned out that that woman was no ordinary female elder at all.

She was the Purple Star Hall’s strongest genius.

In fact, she was deemed to be the Purple Star Hall’s future master.

Sooner or later, the position of the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master would be handed to her.

She was the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master’s third daughter, Li Mengyue.

“That girl, why is she helping Chu Feng?”

“Is she trying to die?”

A look of anger covered the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master’s face. However, his eyes were filled with worries.

For the sake of obtaining the legendary treasure, his Purple Star Hall should not participate in the struggles between any powers.

Because of that, he was worried that his daughter’s interference would change the composition of the Purple Star Variance Realm.

And, more than that, he was worried about his daughter’s safety.

After all, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master had already undergone Demonization.

His death was certain. With that, who knew what he might do.

“Lord Hall Master, I’ll go and bring back Third Young Miss at once.”

By the time Pang Youyang’s words left his mouth, his figure had disappeared from the palace. He was proceeding toward the Purple Star Variance Realm’s entrance.

......

Li Mengyue’s appearance surprised everyone.

After all, Li Mengyue not only possessed great strength, but she also possessed an extraordinary status.

However, even though this exceptionally talented third young miss was a weird individual, she was also extremely proud.

Reportedly, her relationship with her siblings wasn’t that good.

She was a cold figure that almost no one beside the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master could approach.

Thus, why would she come to Chu Feng’s aid at that moment?

Could it be that they were acquainted?

What the crowd didn’t know was that even Chu Feng was surprised to see Li Mengyue standing before him.

Even though Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he had not discovered that she was actually so powerful when he’d interacted with her.

She was actually a rank four Utmost Exalted.

But, with how she was able to effortlessly block the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master’s slash attack, one could tell that she possessed an exceptionally strong battle power that ordinary rank four Utmost Exalteds couldn’t possibly compare to. After all, the slash attack had come from the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

“This matter has nothing to do with you. You should leave,” Chu Feng said to Li Mengyue.

“Nothing to do with me?”

“This matter has occurred in our Purple Star Hall’s territory.”

“Things that occur within our Purple Star Hall’s territory couldn’t possibly be unrelated to our Purple Star Hall.”

“You should leave this matter to me instead. A brat like you should hide behind this big sister and watch how I handle things,” after saying those words, Li Mengyue turned her gaze to the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

“Hey! Old codger, you know who I am?”

“My name’s Li Mengyue. I’m the daughter of the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.”

“How about you give me face and drop this matter here?” Li Mengyue said to the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master with a beaming smile.

“Scram!”

Surprisingly, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master refused to give face to Li Mengyue.

“Oh, you’re refusing the face that’s given to you?”

Even more surprising, Li Mengyue showed no trace of fear towards the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master’s fierce attitude. Instead, her expression changed.

The sweet smile disappeared from her face, and was replaced with a fierce expression.

“A deathwish? Very well, this old man will send you off.”

Suddenly, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master unleashed his attack.

His body shifted and turned into overflowing black flames that rushed straight towards Li Mengyue.

As for Li Mengyue, she was not afraid in the slightest. With a flick of her wrist, an Incomplete Exalted Armament appeared in her hand. Then, she flew towards the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them collided.

That said, even though Li Mengyue possessed extremely strong battle power, she was still forced to retreat repeatedly when confronted with the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master. In merely a couple exchanges, she had fallen into a disadvantaged state.
