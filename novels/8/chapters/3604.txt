Chapter 3604 - The Appearance Of The Undead Man

“We…”

After being berated by Zhang Yanfeng, Zhang Shirui’s little mouth pouted up with extreme grievance. However, she did not dare to refute him.

She was afraid that if she said anything wrong, she would receive another tongue-lashing.

Suddenly, her eyes started to shine. Her gaze landed on Chu Feng.

She discovered that Chu Feng had not only already fused with the lake’s power, but he was also looking at them with a smile on his face. That look of his was clearly that of a person enjoying a show.

“Chu Feng, my big brother made two successive breakthroughs, how many breakthroughs did you manage to make?”

“You’re Chu Xuanyuan’s son. Logically, you should’ve made three successive breakthroughs, no?”

“No, at least four successive breakthroughs. What we sat on were the Void Seats, whereas you ascended to the legendary Sacred Tree Throne.”

“Quickly, show us your cultivation and broaden our horizons. Let us see exactly how breathtaking Chu Xuanyuan’s son’s talent is.”

Zhang Shirui pointed at Chu Feng.

“Right right right. Brother Chu Feng, quickly, broaden our horizons. Let us witness your cultivation.”

Zhang Boyi immediately echoed Zhang Shirui.

The two of them were clearly trying to shift the topic focus onto Chu Feng. They were trying to shift the focus of the conversation to Chu Feng so as to avoid Zhang Yanfeng’s reprimands and criticisms.

What brought Chu Feng the greatest sense of loss was that their diversionary tactics actually worked on Zhang Yanfeng.

At that moment, Zhang Yanfeng was also looking at Chu Feng with great expectation.

Furthermore, the expectation in his eyes were even more intense than Zhang Shirui and Zhang Boyi.

Zhang Shirui and Zhang Boyi were only shifting the topic by asking Chu Feng about his cultivation. Zhang Yanfeng, on the other hand, was truly interested in knowing how much he had increased his cultivation.

Chu Feng was capable of understanding Zhang Yanfeng’s behavior.

After all, everyone had the heart to compete with others. As for the competition between geniuses, it would be who was more talented.

“Brother Chu Feng, how many breakthroughs did you achieve?”

Sure enough, not only was Zhang Yanfeng looking at Chu Feng with expectation, but he ultimately questioned Chu Feng directly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Brother, h-h-h-how many b-breakthroughs did you att-attain? Go-go ahead and s-show them.”

“S-shock t-them, m-m-ma-make their jaws d-drop.”

A voice sounded from outside the lake. It was Wang Qiang. Wang Qiang was sitting by the cliff with his legs hanging over the side. It was unknown as to how he obtained an enormous amount of Sacred Tree Fruits, but he was currently eating them by the mouthful like apples.

That guy was truly acting like someone enjoying a show, truly a member of the peanut gallery.

“I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint you all.”

Chu Feng smiled helplessly. Then, he unleashed his aura.

Rank one Exalted!!!

“Rank one Exalted?”

The three Zhang siblings and Wang Qiang were all shocked upon sensing his aura.

“B-brother, y-y-you’re not b-being h-honest here. W-why would y-you be t-toying us?” said Wang Qiang.

“Brother Chu Feng, there’s no need for you to act like this before us, no?”

“That’s right. We’re not going to be jealous of you. We just want to know how many breakthroughs you’ve had, why must you hide it like that?”

“Brother Chu Feng, you really don’t have to worry about how we might feel. Not to mention making four successive breakthroughs, even if you made enough breakthroughs to directly become a peak Exalted, we’ll still be able to accept it,” Zhang Shirui and Zhang Boyi urged.

“There’s no reason for me to deceive you all. I, Chu Feng, am not that sort of person. Making a breakthrough or not isn’t important. After all, this is my current cultivation,” Chu Feng said with a smile. That was all he could say.

After all, he couldn’t possibly tell them that he had made two successive breakthroughs, and his actual cultivation was that of a rank three Exalted. However, due to the battle between his bloodline power and Sacred Tree Seed, his cultivation had been suppressed.

Even if he were to tell them that, they would not believe him.

“Thus, you are serious?” Zhang Shirui asked.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded.

“Hahahaha….”

Suddenly, Zhang Shirui burst into donkey-like laughter.

That’s right. She was laughing like a donkey.

If Chu Feng didn’t witness it himself, he would not believe that someone was actually capable of laughing like a donkey.

Although her laughter was rather unpleasant to hear, Zhang Shirui was laughing joyfully. She was laughing so hard that she was rocking her body back and forth with her hands across her stomach. She did not attempt to conceal her ridicule for Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you are truly too disgraceful, no? No matter what, you’re senior Chu Xuanyuan’s son. How could you not even make a single breakthrough?”

“If you are to tell us that you didn’t gain any harvest from the Sacred Tree Throne, that would be understandable. After all, the Sacred Tree Seed in the Sacred Tree Throne is extremely difficult to obtain.”

“However, the lake is so very rich with natural energies. Even someone of my aptitude managed to easily make a breakthrough. How could someone with your talent fail to make a breakthrough?”

“It would appear that Chu Xuanyuan’s son is only this capable.”

It was like she had finally obtained an opportunity to humiliate Chu Feng. Zhang Shirui began to relentlessly insult him.

Her reaction was understandable. After all, she had suffered greatly by Chu Feng’s hands earlier. Zhang Shirui was someone who held grudges very deeply. Thus, when the rare opportunity presented itself, she would naturally seize it to properly insult Chu Feng.

“Shirui, don’t be rude,” Zhang Yanfeng said.

“Why? I’m just speaking the truth.”

“Earlier, you said that we didn’t try hard enough to train. The way I see it, this Chu Feng didn’t try hard enough to train either. Otherwise, how could we make breakthroughs in cultivation when he didn’t?”

“I am criticizing him for his own good. I am encouraging him to not repeat his mistake.”

Zhang Shirui was unwilling to back off, and continued to reprimand Chu Feng.

Her each and every word sounded extremely unpleasant to the ears. They were much more offensive than when Zhang Yanfeng reprimanded her and Zhang Boyi.

She was no longer reprimanding Chu Feng. It was not ridicule either. Instead, it was a personal attack.

“D-d-d-damned c-chick, if y-you continue to s-say a-anything about my brother, your d-daddy I will un-undress.”

Wang Qiang’s voice sounded from the cliff. A man of his word, he immediately began to undress.

“Lord Envoy, I was wrong!”

Seeing Wang Qiang who was stripping atop the cliff, Zhang Shirui’s face immediately turned deathly pale with fear.

Having experienced such a thing, Chu Feng was not angered, but instead laughed.

Others might think that Zhang Shirui was completely unreasonable, and even overbearing.

However, Chu Feng felt that girl to be quite amusing.

“Four young friends, you’ve worked hard.”

Right at that moment, another voice sounded from the cliff.

After hearing that voice, Chu Feng and the others immediately turned their gazes over.

They were able to tell that that voice did not belong to Wang Qiang. If it wasn’t Wang Qiang, then it would mean that it must be the voice of that powerful existence, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

Sure enough, a figure appeared beside Wang Qiang. It was that undead man who had been accompanying Wang Qiang the entire time.

He… was the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.
