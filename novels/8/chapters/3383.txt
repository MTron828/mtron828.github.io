Chapter 3383 - The Title Plate Is Fake?

“Wuming Xingyun? Could it be that lord from the Starfield Master Realm, that Saint-cloak World Spiritist currently on top of the Ice Summit?”

The crowd all revealed a startled expression upon seeing the title plate.

Tantai Changfei extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. The title plate in Chu Feng’s hand was sucked into his hand. After inspecting the title plate, he asked with a stern voice, “Where did you obtain this title plate?”

“This title plate was given to me by Lord Wuming Fenghuo,” Chu Feng said.

“Wuming Fenghuo?!”

The crowd were once again astonished upon hearing that name.

The Starfield Master Realm’s Ten Great Experts. They were the strongest individuals in the Starfield Master Realm apart from the Utmost Exalted experts. They were all peak Exalted-level experts. Naturally, the people present had all heard of them.

At that moment, Xu Morong, who had an arrogant expression earlier, was actually starting to panic.

If all of that was real, wouldn’t it mean that he had offended someone connected to the Starfield Master Realm?

Even though he was qualified to throw his weight around with the Tantai Heavenly Clan behind him, it would also depend on who he was throwing his weight on.

Before the Starfield Master Realm, not even the Tantai Heavenly Clan dared to act arrogantly. As such, how could he possibly dare?

“Why did Lord Wuming Fenghuo give you this title plate? Could it be that you’re requesting to see Lord Wuming Xingyun?” Tantai Changfei asked.

“Indeed, I have something that I need to see Lord Wuming Xingyun for,” Chu Feng said.

“Hahaha...” Suddenly, Tantai Changfei burst into loud laughter. Then, he narrowed his eyes and looked to Chu Feng in an extremely hostile manner. “I naturally know that you want to see Lord Wuming Xingyun. Ask any one of the younger generations present, which one of them doesn’t wish to see Lord Wuming Xingyun?”

“However, everyone is lining up in an orderly manner, and following the rules to ascend the mountain. Those who pass the test will naturally be able to see Lord Wuming Xingyun.”

“As for someone like you who would forge a fake title plate of Lord Wuming Xingyun, it’s my first time meeting someone like you.”

“What?! It’s a forged title plate?!”

The crowd were all astonished upon hearing what Tantai Changfei said. Then, they all looked to Chu Feng with contempt.

With only a slight moment of hesitation, they all believed Tantai Changfei’s words.

Indeed. How could a Chu Heavenly Clansman possibly be able to obtain a title plate granted by Lord Wuming Fenghuo?

Everyone was lining up to ascend the mountain. Apart from the Ancestral Martial Decastars, everyone else was relying on their abilities to ascend the mountain to pass the test.

As such, what made a Chu Heavenly Clansman qualified to directly see Lord Wuming Xingyun because of a title plate?

There could only be one explanation for that. That is, the title plate was fake.

“Elder, that title plate is real. That is absolutely true,” seeing this, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief started to panic slightly. He was afraid that these people would really think that Chu Feng was using a fake title plate to deceive them.

The reason for that was because that was not a minor offense at all. Instead, it was a major offense that one would be punished for. As such, he hurriedly explained, “Elder, he also has Lord Wuming Fenghuo’s personal letter. If you do not believe us...”

“Senior, forget it. If he refuses to believe us, no matter what we say, it’ll be useless,” however, Chu Feng shook his head. He knew that if they insisted on saying that title plate was fake, then even if he were to take out the letter, they would just insist on saying that was fake as well.

Thus, Chu Feng had no intention to explain. Instead, he directly said to Tantai Changfei, “If you don’t believe us, you can very well bring that to Lord Wuming Xingyun. He will naturally be able to distinguish whether that title plate is real or not.”

“Humph! You actually want me to bring this fake title plate to Lord Wuming Xingyun?! Is there something wrong with your head, or what?!”

“Men! Arrest this insolent trash of the Chu Heavenly Clan and imprison him in the Fire Prison!” Tantai Changfei shouted.

Once he finished saying those words, the two elders behind him immediately moved toward Chu Feng.

Seeing that, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief wanted to resist. However, before he could do anything, a powerful oppressive might forced him to his knees. It was Tantai Changfei.

Tantai Changfei was, after all, a rank seven Exalted. With him here, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief could not even resist.

“Milord, you are wrongly accusing us, you are truly wrongly accusing us! That title plate is real, it really is real!”

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately tried to explain. However, it was completely useless. Chu Feng had been taken away, and he could only look on helplessly as all of it happened.

“As for the two of you, scram immediately. Otherwise... I will imprison the two of you in the Fire Prison too,” Tantai Changfei said.

“Very well. In that case, Lord Elder, please imprison this old man in the Fire Prison too,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said. He truly wanted to be together with Chu Feng.

After all, he had journeyed together with the intention to protect Chu Feng as much as possible. He was not afraid of dangers. Thus, even though he knew that the Fire Prison was very dangerous, he still wanted to be imprisoned there with Chu Feng.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, right after his words left his mouth, he was knocked flying and smashed ruthlessly onto the mountain’s surface.

Not only was the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief badly mangled, but his health was also extremely weak. He had been seriously injured.

It was Tantai Changfei who had attacked him. With merely a palm strike, he had nearly killed the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. His attack was extremely ruthless.

“You dare ignore the order of our Tantai Heavenly Clan? Are you trying to die?”

“Scram immediately! If I see you again, I’ll take your life.”

Tantai Changfei let out a cold snort. Then, he waved his sleeve and soared into the sky, returning to the summit of the mountain.

“Clan Chief, are you alright?” Wuma Shengjie arrived beside the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

She had originally detested the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. After all, he had failed to protect her parents.

However, when she saw him being seriously injured, she suddenly became very worried about him. Even though she was very surprised at her own behavior, she still arrived beside him to help him up.

“Little swindler, scram with your clan’s old swindler immediately. Otherwise, you’ll really be imprisoned in the Fire Prison,” Xu Morong looked to Wuma Shengjie with a beaming smile and a pleased expression of victory.

Earlier, he was really panicking. It was precisely because he had panicked earlier that he now became particularly happy. After all, in the end, he had won.

At that moment, it was not only the Xu Heavenly Clansmen that were ridiculing Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief; the bystanders were also ridiculing them and casting glances of contempt at them.

Their reactions were understandable. After all, they had all determined Chu Feng’s title plate to be a fake. Thus, they all felt that both Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief were swindlers.

“Laugh, laugh as much as you want. I’m afraid that you will not be able to laugh in the future.”

Wuma Shengjie coldly stared at Xu Morong. Then, she supported the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and began to descend the mountain.

“Motherfucker! A mere swindler dares to act this arrogant?! You’re asking for a beating!” Seeing Wuma Shengjie’s back, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen all felt extremely displeased.

“Forget it, why bother with trash like that? Lowly individuals like them aren’t even qualified to anger us,” Xu Morong sneered. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Wuma Shengjie’s departing words had not managed to affect him. In his eyes, it was akin to a joke for someone like Wuma Shengjie to threaten him. He only found her threats to be laughable.

However, Xu Morong had no idea that Tantai Changfei had not only returned to the Ice Summit, but he had also entered a palace.

Although he didn’t do it deliberately, he had brought Chu Feng’s title plate into that palace.
