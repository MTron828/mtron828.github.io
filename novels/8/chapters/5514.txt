Chapter 5514: Unqualified to Even Be Scolded

The Dragon Clan’s and Phoenix Clan’s auras, which had previously suffused the formation, suddenly looked insignificant before Chu Feng’s red lightning. His red lightning was too great and ferocious. Neither the dragon nor the phoenix meant anything before it.

It was like a true flood dragon had descended into the sea to wreak havoc. At this rate, it wouldn’t be long before the formation was filled to the brim.

“How did this happen? Isn’t that fellow a human? How did he grasp such a huge quantity of aura?”

The Totem Phoenix Clan couldn’t laugh anymore. The sheer aura Chu Feng released was beyond what an ordinary human should possess. To draw a comparison, their auras were like a trickling stream whereas his was a tsunami.

“Those ignorant things. How many imps did they kill? You destroyed all of the beings inside the cavern!” Eggy sneered gleefully. “What a pity they didn’t see what happened inside the cavern, or else they wouldn’t have dared to act so arrogantly.”

Nevertheless, the crowd was still shocked out of their minds. Only the sharp-nosed woman tried her best to feign composure.

“What are you panicking for? He’s putting on an act! There’s bound to be a limit to his bloodline. Do you think he can keep releasing that aura without suffering any backlash? Besides, releasing one’s bloodline is a torturous process. How could he look so calm? He’s putting on an act before us!” the sharp-nosed woman said.

The crowd found that those words made sense.

They had all experienced infusing their bloodline power into the formation, and it felt like their bodies were being emptied. Yet, Chu Feng maintained a perfectly impassive expression. This didn’t make sense.

Bzzt!

Powerful energy suddenly surged through the formation core and evicted the Totem Phoenix Clansmen from within. It was so abrupt that the Totem Phoenix Clansmen were ungracefully shoved out, with some of them scrambling on the ground.

But no one paid that any heed.

The formation that rose from the earth to the sky crackled with furious red lightning, looking like a rampaging beast. The deep growls of the red lightning felt even more intimidating than that of the dragon and the phoenix.

The crowd was dumbstruck.

This phenomenon could only mean that this formation had been completed.

“My gosh! Young hero Chu Feng, you’re incredible! How did you complete that formation so easily?” Long Shanshan and the others were practically dancing around in delight.

In contrast, the Totem Phoenix Clansmen looked despaired.

“What did you say earlier? Did someone say that young hero Chu Feng could never complete the formation? What do you have to say now?” Long Shanshan and Long Fulai scoffed.

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen lowered their heads in embarrassment. They could only concede defeat after witnessing how Chu Feng completed the formation all alone. In fact, to them, this feat was even more incredible than what he had accomplished inside the Demon Crane.

Weng!

The formation core opened up, and Chu Feng walked out.

Long Shanshan and the others rushed over and dropped endless compliments on him. Even the guys like Long Fulai also revealed looks of admiration.

“Did Brother Chengyu and the others head in that direction?” Chu Feng asked as he pointed in the direction where he sensed Long Chengyu’s aura.

“Yes, young master Chengyu and the others are there,” Long Shanshan replied with a nod.

“I understand. You may go into the formation core and cultivate. I’ll go look for Brother Chengyu and the others,” Chu Feng said.

Long Shanshan and the others quickly headed into the formation core. Now that Chu Feng had control over the formation, he could grant the Totem Dragon Clansmen permission to access the formation core.

In contrast, the Totem Phoenix Clansmen could only awkwardly stand outside the formation core. They lowered their heads even further, not daring to look at Chu Feng. They clenched their fists tightly, thinking that Chu Feng would utterly humiliate them for their earlier vile words.

This was simply how the world of cultivation operated. The winner took it all, whereas the loser would be at their mercy.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng left amidst a gust of wind without saying a word. Not only did he not humiliate them, but he didn’t even spare them a glance at all. It was as if they meant nothing to him at all.

His disregard only left them feeling even more humiliated.

…

Chu Feng headed in the direction where Long Chengyu was likely to be. He had now confirmed that he could help the Totem Dragon Clansmen. While completing the formation had no benefits for him, he was fine with it since his goal was to help the Totem Dragon Clan.

“Chu Feng, do you feel nothing from releasing that energy?” Eggy asked.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I can’t say that I felt nothing, but it doesn’t feel anything much either. If I have to put it in words, it feels kind of like drinking a sip of water and spitting it out,” Chu Feng replied.

“What are you saying? I’m asking if you feel any discomfort!” Eggy exclaimed.

She had seen how the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen had suffered by infusing their auras into the formation. Considering how much aura Chu Feng had released in the blink of an eye, it was no wonder she was worried about him.

“I don’t feel any discomfort. I’m not sure why they felt such pain, but I guess that the earlier test in the cavern required them to release their bloodline power, and they inadvertently fused their entire bloodline with those imps inside the water. That would mean that they were depleting their bloodlines when infusing the auras into the formation, which resulted in a huge burden on them.

“The situation is different on my side. The red lightning beast was so powerful that even a bit of its powers was enough to destroy all of the silhouettes in the cavern. Not to mention, what fused with the silhouettes wasn’t my bloodline power but the red lightning beast’s energy. In other words, that aura was as good as given to me for free. I can utilize it, but it has nothing to do with my bloodline. Naturally, it doesn’t deplete my bloodline and thus I won’t feel any pain,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you really all right?” Eggy asked. She was still worried about Chu Feng.

“I’m fine. Look at me. I’m fine and well, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“It does seem like you’re faring better than before, judging from your voice. It’s good as long as you’re fine.” Eggy’s heart was put at ease.

“Hm?” Chu Feng’s expression suddenly turned grim.

A group from the Totem Phoenix Clan was quickly rushing in his direction. It was not their full force, but the ones leading the pack were Feng Jiuyue and Feng Tiansheng. It was already too late to conceal himself as they had already noticed him.
