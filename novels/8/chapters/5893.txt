Chapter 5894: Righting My Father’s Name

“You can’t see it?”

Chu Feng looked at Zi Ling and the others as he asked, but they shook their heads.

Surprised, he looked behind the three statues again. There was definitely a temple’s silhouette there, as faint as it was.

“Elder, can you see it?” Chu Feng asked the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I...” The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief looked awkward. “I can’t see it either. But it’s not just me. Your father couldn’t see it back then too, though he said that he saw it the last time he was here. It’s your first time here, but you’re already seeing it. It looks like you’re even more talented than your father.”

“Why can’t you see it then, father?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“Keep quiet and rest,” the clan chief said.

“Lord Clan Chief, what does it mean to be able to see the Sacred Temple’s silhouette in advance?” Sansheng Xingyu asked.

“It could mean that one is talented or that one has received the acknowledgment of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan. I’m not too sure either,” the clan chief replied.

“Elder, can I enter this Sacred Temple?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng deduced from Sansheng Xingyu’s words that the others would have a chance to see the Sacred Temple’s silhouette later on too. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Each time a formation is breached, our Three Saints Monstrous Clan receives some energy from the Sacred Temple. This energy can’t be used for our personal cultivation, but it can be used to protect our Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

“If sufficient energy is gathered, the Sacred Temple will reveal itself. If the energy surpasses a certain threshold, the Sacred Temple’s gates will enter, and one will have a chance to enter the Sacred Temple,” the clan chief said.

“Elder, have you entered the Sacred Temple before?” Chu Feng asked.

“Both your father and I have entered the Sacred Temple before,” the clan chief replied. “I’m sure the Sacred Temple will open if you can clear this trial.”

“Elder, I heard from Elder Sheng that the Three Saints Monstrous Clan lost its sacred treasures after my father failed his last trial. What will happen if I fail too?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know, but the consequences will be dire. We’ll take responsibility for our losses—we won’t shove the blame to you—but you might lose your life as a result. Chu Feng, it’s up to you whether you want to enter or not. Know that there’s no room for regret once you enter the spirit formation gate,” the clan chief grimly said.

Chu Feng looked at Zi Ling.

“I’ll enter too if you choose to enter. Don’t bother dissuading me,” Zi Ling said with a faint but determined smile.

Chu Feng hesitated, but he still said, “Zi Ling, I’ll be less worried if you wait for me outside.”

“You’re challenging the trial in hopes that you might find something that could aid my recovery. You’re putting your life at stake for me. What reason do I have not to accompany you?” Zi Ling asked.

Hearing that, Chu Feng didn’t bother dissuading Zi Ling anymore. He turned to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and said, “Elder, I’ll enter.”

“Good. However...” The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief revealed an awkward smile. “You can’t enter this spirit formation gate just because you want to.”

“What do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“Go closer. You’ll understand. Make sure to move slowly,” the clan chief said.

Chu Feng began making his way toward the second spirit formation gate but before he could get close, his eyes suddenly fell on the first spirit formation gate. “Was that the spirit formation gate that my father challenged back then?”

“That’s right.” The clan chief nodded.

“The spirit formation gate is closed. Does that mean that it has been cleared?” Chu Feng asked.

“This formation is special. It can’t be gauged by normal standards. It doesn’t make sense for us to lose our sacred treasures if it was cleared,” the clan chief said.

Chu Feng didn’t probe deeper. There was something peculiar about this sacred mountain. There were many mysteries shrouding it. Either the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was withholding information from him, or that he himself didn’t know the details either.

He continued making his way toward the second spirit formation gate, and just as he was about to reach it, a barrier suddenly manifested and blocked his path. This was likely the reason they couldn’t enter and leave the spirit formation gate as they pleased.

Chu Feng observed the runes on the spirit formation gate. The solution looked simple at a glance, but it was deceptively difficult. The person who constructed this formation was likely an extremely powerful world spiritist.

Chu Feng was relieved that he had obtained Qin Jiu’s legacy, which enhanced his control over spirit power and his observation ability. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to pass through this barrier.

After observing for a moment, Chu Feng began constructing a formation to breach the barrier. With a wave of his sleeves, he instantaneously constructed a deciphering formation.

“So fast?” Even Sansheng Xingyu was astounded.

Sansheng Qiutian’s mouth was agape too.

Only those from the Three Saints Monstrous Clan understood the significance of entering this spirit formation gate.

However, Chu Feng dispelled the formation shortly after and continued observing the runes. This time around, he spent twenty whole hours studying them.

“Lord Father, could Chu Feng be stuck too?” Sansheng Qiutian had already recovered by now, and he was worried after seeing how long Chu Feng was stuck on this.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t say a word. Instead, he continued looking at Chu Feng.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng staggered. He was struggling to even keep his balance!

“Big brother Chu Feng!” Zi Ling rushed forward to support Chu Feng.

Sansheng Qiutian rushed forward too.

It was only then they realized that Chu Feng was in a frail condition due to overexerting himself from studying the runes.

“Brother Chu Feng, you don’t have to feel pressured. Our Three Saints Monstrous Clan invited the most powerful monstrous beast world spiritist in the Ancient Era to construct this formation. Not a single one of our clansmen has ever entered this formation. It’s not a big deal if you are unable to breach it too. Don’t injure yourself over this,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

Chu Feng smiled at Sansheng Qiutian and said, “Thank you.”

Following that, he waved his sleeves and constructed yet another deciphering formation.

It was the same deciphering formation as the one he had constructed at the very start.

“Is he trying his luck?” Sansheng Xingyu murmured.

She thought that Chu Feng was constructing the same formation to try his luck after failing to decipher anything else in the twenty hours.

But the moment Chu Feng activated the formation, the barrier shrouding the spirit formation gate dissipated.

“You breached it?” The crowd was astonished.

This formation that was constructed after twenty hours of observation was identical to the one Chu Feng had constructed at the very start, but why was this one able to breach the barrier so easily?

While the crowd was bewildered by the situation, Chu Feng turned to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and said, “Elder, whether you believe it or not, I have confirmed that my father did successfully breach the formation back then. There could be another reason behind the disappearance of the sacred treasures. I shall right my father’s name.”

With that, Chu Feng stepped into the spirit formation gate.
