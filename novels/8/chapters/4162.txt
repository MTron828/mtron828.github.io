Chapter 4162 - Blood-colored Horsetail Whisk

“You actually also grasped the power of the protective formation?!”

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s shock was fully revealed in his voice.

He had discovered that Chu Feng had blocked his attack using the power of the protective formation.

Even though he felt it to be unbelievable, it remained true that Chu Feng had grasped the power of the protective formation.

That was the reason why the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was so shocked.

“Is it that surprising?”

“That’s understandable too. After all, as the person in control of the spirit formation, you failed to detect that I’ve also gained control over the spirit formation, and successfully gained the power of the protective formation.”

“Have you gone senile or something? How come you’ve gotten more and more useless?”

“How come the you from before wasn’t this weak?” mocked Chu Feng.

“You know me?”

“Have I met you before?”

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted narrowed his brows.

He began to carefully examine Chu Feng.

Try as he might, he did not recognize the man before him at all.

That was understandable. After all, Chu Feng had disguised himself.

He currently had a completely new face. It was understandable that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted did not recognize him.

“Of course I know the despicable and shameless Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted,” Chu Feng continued to mock.

Hearing those words, not only did the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted not get angered, he even laughed.

“And here I thought my arrangement was perfect and I would be able to effortlessly obtain the Dragon Vein Source Stone.”

“Never would I have expected for you to suddenly appear. If I’m not mistaken, you’ve long seen through my intentions.”

“If it were others, they would’ve hidden themselves and waited to profit from the resulting fray.”

“But you saw through the intentions of my spirit formation. You knew that you wouldn’t be able to contend against me should I successfully fuse my spirit formation with the protective formation here.”

“That’s why you deliberately revealed yourself and pretended to want to help us. But the reality was that you were planning to secretly seize control of the unsealing formation and the power of the fused formation after entering the formation core.”

“Truth be told, you’ve truly shocked me by how you were able to seize control over the protective formation without me knowing.”

“You are indeed very capable, far more capable than those trash from before.”

“Unfortunately, the main controller of this spirit formation is me. Thus, even though both you and I have gained control over the protective formation’s powers, there’s a difference in the strength of the powers.”

“You are a talent. Unfortunately, you encountered me.”

Although the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was praising Chu Feng, he was actually praising himself.

After he finished saying those words, white gaseous flames surged up from behind him like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses.

such battle deposition was extremely fierce.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was not boasting. He did indeed possess enormous power.

However, although Chu Feng was faced with such power from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, he merely smiled, “Is that so?”

“Boom~~~”

After he finished saying those words, white gaseous flames appeared behind Chu Feng. The white gaseous flames were also the power of the protective formation. Merely, Chu Feng’s protective formation’s power was even stronger than the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s protective formation’s power.

“Why you...”

In the blink of an eye, the two streams of power had collided.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s power could clearly be seen to be on the losing end. The protective formation’s power that Chu Feng controlled was far stronger than his.

This was extremely difficult for the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted to accept.

“You are truly extraordinary.”

“Someone like you shouldn’t be nameless.”

“Tell me, who are you exactly?” the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted asked with a stern voice.

He had realized that he had underestimated Chu Feng again.

He now believed that the man before him was someone renowned.

“You will know who I am. However, you’ll only know when you’re about to die,” said Chu Feng. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hahaha...”

Hearing those words, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted actually burst into sudden laughter.

“You are indeed very powerful, your world spirit techniques have also surpassed my own. If I’m not mistaken, you must’ve grasped at least the rank two Dragon Sensation Transformation. Unfortunately, you’ve made a massive blunder; you have no idea exactly how strong my trump card is.”

“Whilst I admit that your abilities are outstanding, you’ve unfortunately chosen the wrong opponent today.”

After the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted said those words, he flicked his wrist, and a blood-colored horsetail whisk appeared in his hand.

“Clamor~~~”

Once the horsetail whisk appeared, the power of the protective formation grew even stronger.

At that moment, the protective formation’s power under the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s control surpassed Chu Feng’s protective formation’s power.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted that had been in an absolutely disadvantaged position began to supress Chu Feng.

“It’s that horsetail whisk again.”

Chu Feng’s gaze grew stern the moment he saw the blood-colored horsetail whisk.

Back in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints had seized the decisive opportunity and had gained the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

However, even though the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had arrived later than them, he had still managed to gain control over the Great Monster Slayer Emperor Tomb’s power.

It was so much that the power that he had grasped had surpassed that of the Mystic Cave Saints.

If it wasn’t for Chu Feng’s prompt arrival, the Mystic Cave Saints would’ve all died at the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s hands that day.

The reason why the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had been capable of such a feat was all due to that blood-colored horsetail whisk.

Chu Feng knew that the blood-colored horsetail whisk was a rare treasure.

The reason why the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was able to move about unhindered through various remnants and gain all the decisive opportunities was likely all because of his reliance on the blood-colored horsetail whisk.

“That horsetail whisk is quite nice. Unfortunately, it is following the wrong master.”

“From today onwards, I shall be its master instead.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he began to emit a golden gaseous flame.

Then, the shining Nine Dragons Saint Cloak appeared on his body.

With that, Chu Feng’s protective formation’s power increased again.

“As expected, you have a treasure on you.”

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was able to tell that Chu Feng’s Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was a rare treasure.

With the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, Chu Feng’s protective formation’s power had increased to a level that was on par with that of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s protective formation.

However, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted did not concede. Instead, he gritted his teeth and unleashed his full strength in order to face Chu Feng.

As the two fought, the entire grand protective formation began to change. Not only was the surrounding ground ripped apart, the aura of death also began to pervade the air.

Soon, tears began to appear on Chu Feng and the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s bodies. A vast amount of blood was flowing from their wounds.

As pain filled their bodies, the aura of death also descended upon them.

Backlash. This was the effect of the backlash from using the protective formation’s power.

“Let’s stop.”

“Let us call it a day here. Else, both of us will die.”

Seeing that the situation was bad, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted spoke to make peace.

“Bloodmist, as the saying goes, riches and honor shall be sought from danger. How could you be capable of greatness if you’re this scared of death?”

Chu Feng showed no intention of stopping.

“You bastard, I’m not fighting over that Dragon Vein Source Stone anymore. I’m letting you have it, okay?”

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had decided to concede.

He truly did not wish to continue fighting against Chu Feng. His body had already been mutilated beyond recognition. Even his soul had been damaged.

The protective formation’s powers was simply too strong. The backlash was simply unsustainable. If this were to continue, he would undoubtedly die.

After the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted conceded, Chu Feng burst into sudden laughter.

“What are you laughing about?! If you don’t stop now, both of us will die!” shouted the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

He was truly panicking. As a world spiritist, he knew how dangerous things would get if they were to continue fighting.

But Chu Feng remained calm and unhurried.

Even though he had also mutilated beyond recognition, even though he was also receiving the protective formation’s backlash and the enormous pain associated with it, Chu Feng continued to laugh.

“I’m taking the Dragon Vein Source Stone. However, I’m also taking your life.”
