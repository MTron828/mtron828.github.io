Chapter 5407: Black-feathered Specter, I Hope That It’s You

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng rushed forward and grabbed her wrist to check on her condition.

“What are you doing?” Li Wu roared at Chu Feng,

She initially tried to shake off his grasp, but her resistance soon died down. Chu Feng had constructed a formation that delivered energy into her body. Under the influx of energy, the black feathers began to recede as her pain alleviated.

Following that, he constructed another formation and concocted a pill on the spot. He passed the pill to her and said, “Miss Li Wu, consume this. It’ll help with your affliction.”

“Thank you.” Li Wu unhesitatingly took Chu Feng’s pill and consumed it.

She appeared to trust Chu Feng a lot more after how he had helped to alleviate her affliction, and her trust paid off as her condition further improved under the effects of the pill.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“How is it, big brother Chu Feng? Can Miss Li Wu be treated?” Bai Yunqing asked hopefully.

“Don’t worry, there’s a way to cure her,” Chu Feng replied before turning to Li Wu. “Miss Li Wu, where did you catch that affliction?”

He knew very well that it wasn’t an illness. It was actually a curse, one that was likely to be related to the Black-feathered Specter. The Black-feathered Specter was a woman from the Ancient Realm who was sealed into an ancient crystal coffin.

Twenty thousand years ago, the Tantai Heavenly Clan found her tomb and coveted the treasures within, only to awaken her accidentally. The woman inside the coffin transformed into the Black-feathered Specter and them, resulting in their clansmen dying one after another.

Fortunately, this curse eventually vanished together with the Black-feathered Specter, and normalcy returned to the Tantai Heavenly Clan. However, Bai Liluo later arrived at the Tantai Heavenly Clan and sensed the Black-feathered Specter’s presence. She accidentally awakened the Black-feathered Specter once more, and that only further infuriated the latter.

The Black-feathered Specter proceeded to massacre the Tantai Heavenly Clan and attempted to possess Bai Liluo’s body. She eventually spared Bai Liluo, but she still left a curse on her. The curse was extremely troublesome to deal with; Chu Feng had even studied curses for a period of time to help her but to no avail.

Li Wu’s current condition was the exact same as Bai Liluo’s, which led him into thinking that Li Wu might have encountered the Black-feathered Specter too.

“It was inside the Blackwither Forest,” Li Wu replied.

“Blackwither Forest? Where is that?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s located in the inner region of this forest. I name it so because the trees there are black and withered. Natural energies tend to concentrate there on certain days, so I would cultivate there on those days,” Li Wu replied,

“Miss Li Wu, did you encounter anything there?” Chu Feng asked.

“Not at all.” Li Wu shook her head. “But once, I entered the Blackwither Forest and found that the concentration of natural energies there was higher than ever. I tried to cultivate, but a chilling sensation shook up my mind and hindered my cultivation. I felt unnerved, so I left early that day. By the time I returned to this courtyard, I was already afflicted with this illness. I suspect that my illness might be related to that,” Li Wu replied.

“Miss Li Wu, can you tell me where’s the Blackwither Forest?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’d advise you not to go there. I have tried investigating that region since there might be a clue to my affliction there, but the moment I step into the Blackwither Forest, I’d suddenly be overwhelmed by a strong feeling of discomfort. I don’t think that what I have is an illness but a curse,” Li Wu said.

“Is it really a curse?” Bai Yunqing asked in shock.

He had also sensed that Li Wu’s affliction wasn’t just a simple illness but a curse.

“Yes, it’s a curse. I have a friend who suffered from the same curse as you,” Chu Feng said.

“The same curse?”

The astonished Bai Yunqing and Li Wu turned to Chu Feng, and Chu Feng told them about the Black-feathered Specter.

“Big brother Chu Feng, you’re saying that the terrifying Black-feathered Specter might have settled down here after leaving your Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“That’s what I am thinking, but I wouldn’t discount other possibilities. It’s hard to say for sure since it’s the Ancient Era we’re talking about here. There could be other beings in the Ancient Era other than the Black-feathered Specter that has grasped the art of cursing,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s true. I guess we’ll have to venture into the Blackwither Forest to know for sure. Big brother Chu Feng, help me look after Miss Li Wu. I’ll head in to take a look,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Wu!”

Li Wu’s face suddenly scrunched up in pain. The curse had struck again.

Chu Feng hurriedly treated her once more. He was able to swiftly suppress the curse, but her body was visibly growing feebler. Her condition looked to be more severe than Bai Liluo, such that her curse could act up at any moment.

To be safe, Chu Feng concocted a few more pills that could suppress the curse and handed them to Bai Yunqing. “Stay here and take care of Miss Li Wu. I’ll go.”

“This won’t do, big brother Chu Feng!” Bai Yunqing rejected the notion.

“Don’t be so wishy-washy. I have my means to protect myself. You’ll only be a burden if you tag along, not to mention that we need someone here to take care of Miss Li Wu,” Chu Feng said.

“This…”

Bai Yunqing’s initial thought was to shoulder the danger by himself, but Chu Feng’s words made sense too. It made more sense to leave the exploration of the Blackwither Forest to Chu Feng since he was stronger. Under such logic, he had no choice but to compromise.

“All right, big brother Chu Feng. I really don’t know how I should thank you,” Bai Yunqing said with a head lowered in shame.

He should have been the one to resolve these issues if he had not been so powerless. He also couldn’t bear to leave Li Wu’s side now when she was in such a precarious position. In the end, he could only leave the problem to Chu Feng.

“We’re brothers. Don’t sweat it. Rest assured, I’ll definitely return safely.” Chu Feng patted Bai Yunqing’s shoulder with a smile.

“Young master Chu Feng, you really shouldn’t head inside the Blackwither Forest,” Li Wu said.

“Miss Li Wu, we know about the dangers lurking on this land. Back when my brother brought his master here to diagnose your condition, his master noticed something peculiar inside the forest and dragged my brother away out of fear for his safety,” Chu Feng said.

Li Wu interjected with a cold sneer, “I know that.”

“You might be aware of that, but you don’t know the full story. My brother received a stern warning from his master to never return here, or else he would be punished. My brother sees his master as his benefactor and deeply respects him, but he still chose to come here despite his master’s warning. That is how important you are to him,” Chu Feng said.

Li Wu fell silent. That matter was indeed a thorn in her heart.

Humans naturally looked toward others for support when they were at their weakest, and Bai Yunqing had been Li Wu’s pillar of support back then. Her hopes were lifted when Bai Yunqing brought his master over to treat her, but the latter scorned her and dragged Bai Yunqing away with him. She saw it as a betrayal, and it wounded her greatly.

Li Wu hesitated for a brief moment before drawing out a map of the Blackwither Forest. She handed the map to Chu Feng and said, “I’ll be counting on you, young master Chu Feng.”

Chu Feng took the map and left.

“Is what he said true?” Li Wu asked Bai Yunqing shortly after Chu Feng left.

“Yes,” Bai Yunqing replied.

“Your big brother is much more reliable than your master,” Li Wu said.

“Miss Li Wu, my master is actually…”

Bai Yunqing tried speaking up for his master, not wanting to see a rift between two of the most important people to him.

“Don’t bother. I only believe what I see. I’m going to rest now,” Li Wu said coldly before heading into the room.

Bai Yunqing stood at attention outside the room, ready to charge in should Li Wu suffer another episode of the curse. His eyes unconsciously drifted toward the direction where Chu Feng had left as he murmured, “Big brother Chu Feng, nothing must happen to you.”

…

Following the map, Chu Feng quickly made his way into the depths of the Ancient Era forest.

While he had said that the one who planted the curse on Li Wu was not necessarily the Black-feathered Specter, his instincts told him that the Black-feathered Specter was likely in this forest. This was good news for him, for he had been wanting to find the Black-feathered Specter to lift Bai Liluo’s curse once and for all.

In other words, he was doing this not just for Li Wu but Bai Liluo too.

The Blackwither Forest finally appeared in his line of sight, but at the same time, he felt a chilly aura enveloping his surroundings. Everything here was screaming danger to him.

Most people would have turned tail and fled at this point, but Chu Feng only smiled excitedly and murmured, “I hope that it’s you, Black-feathered Specter.”
