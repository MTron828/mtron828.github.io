Chapter 3592 - The Disappearance Of The Sacred Tree

“Buzz~~~”

At the moment when the crowd were all wondering if Qin Kunlun was truly still alive, a dazzling light appeared before everyone’s eyes.

In the next moment, their surroundings went completely white.

The crowd all lost the ability to move. They were able to feel an enormous power pushing their bodies forward and rapidly moving them.

That said, this sort of situation did not last for a very long time.

Soon, the power pushing the crowd forward disappeared, and their surroundings were no longer covered in white light.

They had returned to the real world.

Furthermore, they were able to see the enormous, so enormous that it caused the crowd to feel reverence, Void Sacred Tree.

Merely, at that moment, the crowd were all standing outside the Void Sacred Tree.

Furthermore, they were no longer able to enter the Void Sacred Tree, as the barrier around it had appeared again, cutting the crowd out.

Upon discovering that they’d left the Void Sacred Tree, the first reaction of the crowd was to examine their surroundings. They were looking for the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

After all, the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were a fatal threat to them.

“Why isn’t there a single Blood-devouring Demon Clansman to be seen?”

Upon inspecting, the crowd discovered that the people in the Sacred Palace Hall were all gathered here. The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were the only ones that were not present.

“No, there’s also Chu Feng! Young friend Chu Feng is also not present!” Someone suddenly cried out in alarm.

Upon closer inspection, the crowd discovered that Chu Feng really wasn’t there.

“Could it be that what the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief said was true, that Lord Qin Kunlun is truly still alive? Wouldn’t this mean that... they’ve reached that legendary existence?!”

At that moment, many people revealed envious looks on their faces.

“Clatter~~~”

Suddenly, a violent wind swept forth and covered the entire region.

The direction from which the violent wind originated was the Void Sacred Tree.

Subconsciously, the crowd turned their eyes to the Void Sacred Tree. They wanted to figure out what was happening.

“That is?!!!”

Upon looking at it, the crowd all opened their eyes wide with shock. They did not even dare to believe the sight before them.

The enormous leaves of the Void Sacred Tree had all fallen from it.

Like a rainstorm of leaves, they sweep across the sky and landed on the ground.

As there were too many leaves, and the leaves were too large, the surrounding ground was soon completely covered by the leaves. Countless leaves filled the ground as far as the eye could see. It was like an ocean of leaves. The sight was rather spectacular.

That said, although the ground looked spectacular, when the crowd looked to the Void Sacred Tree floating in the sky, they felt a sort of indescribable sensation.

The enormous Void Sacred Tree was completely bare. Only its tree trunk and branches remained. There was not a single bit of foliage on its branches. All its leaves had fallen to the ground.

Because of that, the crowd all had the same question in their hearts.

Why would the leaves of the Void Sacred Tree all fall all of a sudden???

“Something’s wrong!!!”

Soon, the crowd discovered that it was not only the leaves that had all fallen from the Void Sacred Tree. The Void Sacred Tree itself was also withering. It was as if it had lost its life power.

“What’s going on? What’s happening to the Void Sacred Tree?”

The crowd were all frightened upon witnessing such a thing.

After all, they’d all experienced the power of the Void Sacred Tree. When they were in the Void Sacred Tree, they’d all lost their extraordinary abilities, and were completely overpowered by the Void Sacred Tree’s powers.

This was especially true in regards to the Sacred Palace Hall. A place so rich in natural energies was truly rare.

Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been possible for the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief to be able to make a breakthrough to Utmost Exalted in such a short period of time.

That said, why would such a powerful Void Sacred Tree become like that?

It simply looked like it was on the verge of dying.

Could it be that such a sacred cultivation ground would end up being destroyed?

“Could it be that this is caused by the Blood-devouring Demon Clan?” someone asked.

“Impossible. How could they possess that sort of capability?”

However, that theory was immediately refuted.

Upon thinking about it, it really didn’t make much sense. The strongest person among the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen was their clan chief. However, he had only managed to make a breakthrough to Utmost Exalted with the power of the Void Sacred Tree. Thus, how could he possibly be able to bring ruin upon the Void Sacred Tree?

Suddenly, someone shouted, “Look! The Void Sacred Tree is crumbling!”

“Heavens! The Void Sacred Tree is actually really crumbling!”

In the next moment, shock filled the faces of everyone present. Unable to take their eyes away, they stared at the Void Sacred Tree.

The enormous Void Sacred Tree was indeed crumbling and shattering. The parts that shattered turned into gaseous flames and scattered into thin air.

Soon, the enormous Void Sacred Tree that was capable of covering the sky disappeared before the crowd’s vision.

“Could it be that the Void Sacred Tree was truly destroyed like that?”

The crowd all felt extremely shaken to personally witness the disappearance of the Void Sacred Tree.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the ground was still covered in leaves, the crowd would not have believed what they’d witnessed.

“What an enormous pity. A sacred cultivation ground like that would be able to benefit countless future generations. It’s truly a pity that the people of the future generation will no longer have the chance to benefit from this sacred cultivation ground.”

The expressions of the crowd turned very complicated. They were not only feeling sadness and a sense of loss.

To martial cultivators, having such a sacred cultivation ground disappear was not a good thing at all.

“It’s gone just like this?”

“What about Feng’er?”

“Where’s Feng’er?”

Compared to the others, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was panicking.

He simply did not care about why the Void Sacred Tree would wither and disappear.

There was only a single thing that he was concerned about -- where was Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu, you don’t have to worry too much about it. We were all brought out here by the power of the Void Sacred Tree. Young friend Chu Feng not being brought out here might not necessarily be a bad thing.”

“After all, he has experienced so much in the Void Sacred Tree. If all of that was a test, then no one has endured more tests than him, and no one would be more excellent than him.”

“Thus, I believe that it’s very possible that young friend Chu Feng is still in the Sacred Palace Hall. Perhaps there’s an even greater opportunity waiting for him,” said Tantai Yinjian.

“Lord Tantai, in that case, does it mean that the Void Sacred Tree did not completely disappear, but rather, it just looked like it disappeared?” Someone asked.

“That possibility is there. In fact, this sort of thing has happened multiple times in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. There are multiple occasions where a sacred cultivation ground appears to have disappeared, only to be hidden instead,” said Tantai Yinjian.

“I truly hope for the Void Sacred Tree to have concealed itself instead of disappearing,” the crowd sighed in succession.

Even though they all felt what Tantai Yinjian said to be very reasonable, it remained, that they’d personally witnessed the Void Sacred Tree withering from a state of full bloom, and then disappearing.

Thus, if they were to use their logic to make their deductions, they felt that the Void Sacred Tree had likely already perished.

As for Chu Feng... the crowd were more willing to believe that he had been captured by the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

After all, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan possessed such a deep understanding of the Void Sacred Tree. Although they might not be able to control its powers, they should be able to trap Chu Feng in the Void Sacred Tree.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
