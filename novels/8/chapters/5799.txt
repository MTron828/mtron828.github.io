Chapter 5799: Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist

“It’s not too late for you to leave now,” Song Changsheng said.

“You sure know how to put on airs. Do you honestly think I, the great Huangfu Zhantian, would be defeated by the likes of you?” Huangfu Zhantian reached for the wooden box behind him and retrieved a lightning spear from it.

It was a God Armament.

With a God Armament in hand, Huangfu Zhantian’s fighting prowess was greatly boosted. Even their surroundings began to shake despite being in the middle of boundless space.

Despite Huangfu Zhantian’s show of might, Song Changsheng’s attention was on the Pulse Ignition Realm. He spotted thousands of figures slipping into the sealed realm and flitting toward the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. They wore robes similar to Huangfu Zhantian’s, indicating that they were from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan.

At this rate, they were going to cross paths with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“Where are you looking?”

Without any warning, Huangfu Zhantian thrust his spear toward Song Changsheng.

Song Changsheng raised his bare hand and stopped Huangfu Zhantian’s spear in its tracks. Through clenching his fist, he delivered a shockwave through the spear at Huangfu Zhantian.

Caught off guard by that shockwave, Huangfu Zhantian was jolted to his knees.

“You bastard!”

Huangfu Zhantian was infuriated. He felt thoroughly humiliated as he hadn’t expected himself to be subdued in such a manner. He exerted all his strength in an attempt to return to his feet, only to realize that the force was too strong.

Tzlala!

Huangfu Zhantian activated the Lightning Mark, but to his astonishment, he was still unable to oppose the force exerted by a single arm of Song Changsheng.

He proceeded to summon the Lightning Armor, but even so, he was unable to rise to his feet.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This time around, he was stunned. He was left with no choice but to accept the reality before him no matter how reluctant he was to do so.

He raised his head to look at Song Changsheng, only to see that the other party wasn’t even looking at him. The other party was focused on the situation inside the Pulse Ignition Realm. Seeing that, his anger dissipated.

He realized that it was ridiculous for him to get angry here, especially against an opponent this powerful.

“You don’t seem interested in taking my life?” Huangfu Zhantian asked.

“I have no reason to take your life,” Song Changsheng replied with his eyes still fixated on the Pulse Ignition Realm.

“I won’t interfere in what’s happening below. Can you pretend that you didn’t see me here?” Huangfu Zhantian asked.

“Sure,” Song Changsheng replied.

“Can you also keep my defeat a secret?” Huangfu Zhantian asked once more.

Song Changsheng finally turned to look at Huangfu Zhantian. He loosened his grip on the latter’s spear, which also freed the latter from the force holding him down, before replying, “Sure.”

Huangfu Zhantian was finally able to rise to his feet. He bowed to Song Changsheng and said, “You have my gratitude.”

He stood beside Song Changsheng to observe the situation inside the Pulse Ignition Realm.

By then, the Huangfu Heavenly Clansmen had already arrived before the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. Their appearance piqued the attention of the powers gathered there, especially since they were unfamiliar faces.

Most figured that they were the ones behind the lightning chains that sealed off the realm, considering the time of their appearance. Thus, no one dared to put their guard down around them.

All of a sudden, a person appeared out of thin air before the Huangfu Heavenly Clan. Tens of thousands of people swiftly descended afterward and stood in a neat formation behind him.

They were from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and the person at the forefront was their Mansion Master, Jie Tianran.

“Who are you?” Jie Tianran asked.

“I’m the Huangfu Heavenly Clan’s Huangfu Bufan,” the man leading the Huangfu Heavenly Clan said.

The Huangfu Heavenly Clan? Are they related to the five people who entered the Nine Heavens’ Zenith earlier?

It was initially just a doubt, but from the juniors who had started emerging from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, the crowd quickly learned that the Huangfu Heavenly Clan was from an Ancient Era Heavenly Clan.

Those from the Ancient Era usually lived discreetly in remnants, so there had been no significant clashes between them and present-day cultivators. It was bewildering why the Huangfu Heavenly Clan had suddenly come here.

This was not a matter to make light of, as it could shake up the world of cultivation’s current status quo. Even the powerhouses had grim expressions, as they felt stressed by the Huangfu Heavenly Clan’s appearance.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master calmly looked at Huangfu Bufan and asked, “Were you the one who set up the lightning chains?”

“That’s right,” Huangfu Bufan replied.

“What’s your intention?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Juniors of our Huangfu Heavenly Clan have entered the Nine Heavens’ Zenith and died inside. Unless we receive a reasonable explanation and compensation, everyone in this world shall be buried with them,” Huangfu Bufan said.

“Isn’t that too much?”

The crowd thought that this was ridiculous. Casualties were inevitable in trials. Anyone who wished to participate in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith should come with the resolve that they might lose their life. Yet, the Huangfu Heavenly Clan was threatening to kill everyone here for the death of their juniors.

It was one thing if they were referring to the natives living in the Pulse Ignition Realm, but elites from all over the world of cultivation were gathered here. Even Jie Tianran, the man known to be the strongest in the current world of cultivation, was here.

The Huangfu Heavenly Clan was too arrogant to dare utter such words.

“Were there no rules back in the Ancient Era?” Jie Tianran asked.

“Rules? Of course there were, but they were dictated by the strong,” Huangfu Bufan replied.

“I don’t want to kill anyone today. Remove the seal and leave.” Jie Tianran waved his hand.

“Hah… I don’t think you understand your position,” Huangfu Bufan sneered.

He released a powerful oppressive might that crushed down on the surroundings. Those who felt the oppressive might paled in despair, for they could sense his power towered above True God level cultivators.

Huangfu Bufan was actually a Heavenly God level cultivator!

How could the crowd not despair when they were up against such an enemy?

It had been a long time since Heavenly Gods had disappeared from the world. There were plenty of True God level cultivators present here, but even if they joined hands, it would be hard for them to oppose a Heavenly God level cultivator.

If Huangfu Bufan sought to take their lives today, their only option was to accept their death.

Just as the crowd was despairing over Huangfu Bufan’s oppressive might, a brilliant light suddenly shone over the land and dispelled Huangfu Bufan’s oppressive might.

And this light was from Jie Tianran.

“This feeling…”

Most of the crowd felt conflicted upon sensing Jie Tianran’s aura, but those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion broke out into delighted cheers.

“Our Lord Mansion Master has made a breakthrough to become a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist!”
