Chapter 5639: The Route My Mother Walked

“Sure,” Chu Feng replied.

“Good. I like decisive people!” Xiao Yueyue chuckled as she sat down beside Chu Feng. Her attitude improved significantly after learning Chu Feng’s identity. “Don’t mind me earlier, though you can’t blame me for it. Your eyes are really bad. Are you really unable to tell that I’m a lady?”

That question was asked with an earnest expression.

Chu Feng took a careful look at Xiao Yueyue before replying, “I mean no disrespect, but it’s not easy for me to tell.”

“Narrow-minded! You men are narrow-minded, judging a person by their appearance!” Xiao Yueyue pouted her thick lips, but she wasn’t really angry.

“Well…” Chu Feng didn’t know how to respond to those words. It was not a matter of him judging a person by their appearance, but Xiao Yueyue simply didn’t look or feel like a woman. “Miss Xiao, can you tell me about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain now?”

“Chu Feng, you really don’t know about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain? Don’t pull my leg,” Xiao Yueyue replied in disbelief.

“I really don’t know,” Chu Feng replied.

“You asked the right person then. I know more about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain than the others,” Xiao Yueyue said gleefully. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

She began to share what she knew about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.

The Nine Heavens Secret Domain was discovered in the early years of the current era. It was likely created in the Ancient Era, though there were marks that suggested that cultivators from the Ancient Era had been in there too.

Only world spiritists could enter the remnant as one had to exert their psyche to get past its entrance. Many formidable martial cultivators in the early years of the current era tried to enter the remnant but to no avail. This showed that the remnant contained a very powerful formation.

The Nine Heavens Secret Domain was yet to be fully explored to date, making it one of the most enigmatic remnants in the world. The remnant had many frightening mechanisms and terrifying lifeforms that resembled ferocious beasts. These beasts lacked wits, but they were incredibly strong.

At opposite ends of the remnant were an entrance and an exit. Those who entered via the entrance would encounter many paths that could be broadly classified into two categories. One was for elders, and the other was for juniors.

Only one path in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain had been fully explored, and it was a path for the juniors. The person who cleared the path was none other than Jie Ranqing.

“Even Jie Ranqing suffered huge losses from the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. More than ten thousand juniors had accompanied her on her journey, but only a dozen of them walked out of the remnant alive with her. Even so, they were either crippled for good or had gone insane, so the only one who truly returned safely from the remnant was Jie Ranqing herself.

“Still, that was considered a formidable feat. For many years before Jie Ranqing’s appearance, all kinds of powers had dispatched powerful elders and prodigious juniors to explore the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, but none of them returned except for those who fled halfway through the expedition, Jie Ranqing was the only one who has walked out from the exit. In other words, the Nine Heavens Secret Domain is practically a death trap.

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has already said that we aren’t allowed to give up halfway, which means that we’ll have to clear the entire path. Do you finally understand why the others are so afraid?” Xiao Yueyue asked with a smile.

“It’s because death is almost guaranteed,” Chu Feng replied.

“Indeed,” Xiao Yueyue replied with a nod.

“Why aren’t you afraid?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am afraid, but there’s no point wallowing in fear. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is right. We came here to benefit, but there’s no such thing as a free lunch in the world. There’s nothing to grumble about since we were the ones who made our own choices,” Xiao Yueyue said.

“You’re quite open-minded.”

Chu Feng didn’t agree with Xiao Yueyue’s thoughts since the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion hadn’t been completely honest about the entrance examination. Without a doubt, many people would have dropped out if they had said in advance that the combat exam would be held in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.

All of a sudden, Xiao Yueyue sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng, saying, “Don’t despair, Chu Feng. I have a tip-off that there’s still hope for us.”

“What do you mean?” Chu Feng replied via voice transmission, knowing that Xiao Yueyue had switched over because she didn’t want others to eavesdrop on their conversation.

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has spared no effort to explore the Nine Heavens Secret Domain over the years. On average, they would conduct two expeditions every hundred years. However, it has been centuries since the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s last expedition, and the last expedition they held was when Jie Ranqing was still a junior.

“They have withheld exploring the Nine Heavens Secret Domain for so many years not because they have given up but because they are making preparations. I heard that they have been analyzing the route Jie Ranqing took when she cleared the Nine Heavens Secret Domain back then.

“In truth, she came up with a method to clear the route afterward, just that she was no longer a junior by then. There’s no way for her to personally prove that her method is feasible anymore. She did think about challenging the other routes, but she was stopped by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Prodigies like her were important for their future, after all. There was no way they would allow her to take such risks.

“In fact, she had to sneak into the Nine Heavens Secret Domain the last time she entered the remnant. None of the ten thousand people accompanying her were top prodigies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion; many of them were even juniors from subordinate powers.

“Anyway, the important thing is that Jie Ranqing has figured out a solution for the route she ventured in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. While the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion might be making use of us to verify the feasibility of the route, it’s unlikely that they are intending for us to die in vain. They’d probably tell us the solution Jie Ranqing came up with, or at least a portion of it even if not the full one.

“That being said, we aren’t Jie Ranqing. Even though she was young and weak when she entered the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, she is still not someone we can rival. While there’s hope for us to clear the route, the chances are slim,” Xiao Yueyue said.

“Do you know how old and strong Lord Jie Ranqing is when she entered the Nine Heavens Secret Domain?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m not sure what her spirit power was, but I believe she was under thirty,” Xiao Yueyue replied.

“That’s quite young,” Chu Feng remarked.

There were many young prodigies in the world of cultivation, but most of those participating in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s entrance examination were almost a hundred years of age. Chu Feng, who was under fifty years of age, was young compared to the others.

He was still venturing the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm back when he was in his twenties, but his mother had already cleared an impossible remnant like the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. While she did have a behemoth backing her, there was no questioning her talent.

The thought of that made Chu Feng’s heart swell with pride. That was his mother, after all.

“Chu Feng, you shouldn’t underestimate her just because she’s under thirty. It’s Jie Ranqing we’re talking about here! I don’t know her exact spirit power then, but she’s bound to be stronger than us. There’s no way we can compete with her. Don’t get careless, all right?” Xiao Yueyue said.

“I won’t,” Chu Feng replied.

“So you say, but why do you seem more excited after hearing my words?” Xiao Yueyue asked.

Chu Feng chuckled in response. He was indeed excited to venture on the same route as his mother.
