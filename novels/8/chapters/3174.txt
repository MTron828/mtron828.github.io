Chapter 3174 - The Appearance Of The Mighty Duo

“Trash that does not know the immensity of the heaven and earth, who gave you the courage to act so condescending and arrogant?!” Qingyu Fengming pointed at Chu Feng. He was so furious his face had turned ashen.

He wanted to scare Chu Feng witless. Only by doing so would he be able to ease the anger in his heart.

However, Chu Feng just so happened to be unmoved by his intimidation. Even when facing the Dragon and Tiger Brothers, he was still calm and composed.

Qingyu Fengming found this truly intolerable. In fact, he was at a loss as to how to handle Chu Feng.

“Little brother Fengming, you don’t have to get angry with someone like him. Allow us to handle the rest.”

Qingyu Yunlong patted Qingyu Fengming’s shoulder with a smile. Then, he turned his gaze to Chu Feng. His gaze was extremely icy and cold.

“Chu Feng, I know who you are. Indeed, you possess quite an origin.”

“However, even if your father is Chu Xuanyuan, I will still not stand by and forgive you after you’ve bullied and humiliated our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s subsidiary power.”

Qingyu Yunlong said those words for the subsidiary powers present to hear. He wanted them to know that following their Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan meant that they would definitely not be bullied by others, that not even Chu Xuanyuan’s son could bully them.

Sure enough, hearing what Qingyu Yunlong said, the subsidiary powers were all content.

They all felt that their decision to follow the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan was an extremely correct decision.

However, they had no idea that if it wasn’t for the fact that Chu Feng had already offended the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan beforehand, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan would not have bothered to concern themselves with the Burnfield Monstrous Clan’s business.

Seemingly noticing the reaction from the crowd, the corners of Qingyu Yunlong’s mouth were raised into a complacent smile. He looked to Chu Feng again and was planning to threaten him.

However, to his surprise, before he could say anything, Chu Feng said, “Enough of your superfluous words. Why don’t you say what you want to do directly? Why bother with all that rubbish and beating around the bush. Are you all effeminate or what?”

“You bastard!”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the smile that had just risen on Qingyu Yunlong’s face was immediately replaced with a curve of anger.

It was not only him whose expression changed. After Chu Feng said those words, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen’s faces all turned green.

They did not understand why, instead of admitting defeat, Chu Feng would instead try to infuriate Qingyu Yunlong repeatedly.

“Chu Feng, I think that what little brother Fengming said is very correct. You are truly one to not know the immensity of heaven and earth.”

“Originally, I was only planning to teach you and your clansmen a lesson. However... I will now make you unable to speak those sorts of arrogant words again! I will make you only be able to make lunatic ramblings.”

“I will destroy your body, tear your soul apart repeatedly, and turn you into a madman!”

After Qingyu Yunlong finished saying those words, he unleashed his overwhelming oppressive might.

It was not only the people outside the city, even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were inside the city were able to sense how frightening that oppressive might was.

They were all deeply frightened. They all felt that they were definitely doomed.

However, they had no idea that whilst the power of that oppressive might could be felt inside the city, that oppressive might was simply unable to cause them any harm.

The reason for that was because the grand defensive formation had been activated by Chu Feng.

As such, Chu Feng was still completely confident. He was certain that, with Qingyu Yunlong’s strength, he would not be able to breach the grand defensive formation and bring harm to them.

“You damned bastard!”

Qingyu Yunlong originally thought that Chu Feng would show fear the moment he revealed his oppressive might.

He did not expect Chu Feng’s expression to remain unchanged even after he unleashed his oppressive might. This caused him to feel extremely displeased, and increasingly angry.

Overwhelmed by rage, Qingyu Yunlong let forth his oppressive might, transforming it. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

His oppressive might was no longer ordinary oppressive might. Instead, it had become an attack. That attack of his was aimed only at Chu Feng. Like an invisible army, it moved foward to attack Chu Feng.

“Rumble~~~”

However, right after that oppressive might was sent toward Chu Feng, a loud explosion was suddenly heard.

Following that, Qingyu Yunlong’s oppressive might scattered.

“This...” This scene completely startled everyone. They did not understand what had happened.

The first person to react was Qingyu Yunlong. After all, it was his oppressive might. He was able to clearly sense that someone had interfered and dispersed it.

This caused Qingyu Yunlong to feel even more furious.

With rage, Qingyu Yunlong shouted, “Who is it?! Get the hell out for your daddy!”

“Daddy? Qingyu Yunlong, since when did you start proclaiming yourself as daddy?”

Suddenly, a voice was heard from the direction where that oppressive might was shattered. Following that, two figures appeared.

“Those are?!”

Seeing those two people, the expressions of everyone present changed enormously.

Not to mention the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, Burnfield Monstrous Clan and their allies, even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen’s expressions had changed to ones of astonishment.

The reason for that was because the two people that had appeared were two famed individuals in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Eastern Region, the Mighty Dongguo Duo.

“Heavens! It’s actually the Mighty Dongguo Duo. Why... why would they appear here?”

“They are the ones that scattered Qingyu Yunlong’s oppressive might? Why did they interfere?”

“Wasn’t it said that the Dongguo Heavenly Clan has parted ways with the Chu Heavenly Clan, that they are completely unrelated to one another now?”

Once the Mighty Dongguo Duo appeared, the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, Burnfield Monstrous Clan and their allies all began to discuss their appearances spiritedly.

They all knew very well how powerful the Mighty Dongguo Duo were. After all, they were people that were equally as famous as the Dragon and Tiger Brothers.

With the two of them present, it would truly be difficult to take care of Chu Feng.

“No wonder little brother Chu Feng is this confident. So he had actually successfully obtained the Dongguo Heavenly Clan’s forgiveness. The Dongguo Heavenly Clan is willing to help us.”

Chu Ping became extremely excited. It was as if he had realized where Chu Feng got his confidence from.

However, he did not notice that even Chu Feng had a surprised expression in his eyes after the Mighty Dongguo Duo appeared.

If it weren’t for the crowd’s discussions, Chu Feng would not even know who the two men before him were, much less why they were helping him.

“No wonder Chu Feng is so arrogantly confident. It turned out he had requested help from the two of you.”

At that moment, Qingyu Yunlong felt extremely displeased. Upon discovering that their opponents were the Mighty Dongguo Duo, Qingyu Yunlong knew that this matter had became thorny.

At least, it would be very difficult for him to achieve his plan to personally take care of Chu Feng.

That said, the Mighty Dongguo Duo were feeling very wronged upon hearing what Qingyu Yunlong said.

They thought to themselves, ‘The two of us were secretly protecting Chu Feng. Chu Feng and the others didn’t know about us being here. Who knows why that Chu Feng is so calm and composed.’
