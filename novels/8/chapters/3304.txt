Chapter 3304 - Was Defeated By Him

“Hongyue, it’s your turn.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Liangqiu Chengfeng’s voice was heard from within the grand unsealing formation. Merely, this time around, his tone was rather strict.

It would appear that Liangqiu Chengfeng was very dissatisfied with the failure of their unsealing formation.

Liangqiu Lanyue immediately stepped aside, and Liangqiu Hongyue took her place.

“Buzz~~~”

Light began to shine brightly. The grand unsealing formation was activated once more.

Following that, the formation controlled by Liangqiu Hongyue was also activated.

The younger generations within that formation were all exerting all their might to assist with the activation of the formation.

The two formations were coordinating with one another from both inside and outside. At that moment, the defensive formation that protected the Ancient Era’s remnant began to tremble violently again, as if it were receiving an enormous impact.

In the blink of an eye, another hour passed. However, the grand defensive formation was still present. Even the crack had only expanded slightly.

In fact, the amount by which the crack expanded this time by was even less than when Liangqiu Lanyue was in control of the unsealing formation.

“Useless! Master entered closed-door training to teach the two of you world spirit techniques, are you two really this incompetent?!”

A voice of anger sounded. It was Liangqiu Chengfeng.

After Liangqiu Chengfeng shouted angrily, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled profoundly.

He had heard that Liangqiu Chengfeng was a very amiable person, but would become irritable when he was focused on unsealing formations. Seeing his behavior at this moment, it would appear that that was indeed the case.

“Senior brother, that defensive formation is simply too strong. You cannot blame us for our failure,” Liangqiu Hongyue said.

Although she had refuted Liangqiu Chengfeng, her tone was very lacking in terms of confidence. Instead, it was a tone of grievance. It would appear that even though Liangqiu Hongyue was very haughty and conceited, she was still deeply afraid of Liangqiu Chengfeng.

“This is the only feasible method to destroy that defensive formation. Furthermore... the spirit formation that I had you all set up is able to coordinate with my spirit formation from the inside. It is most definitely capable of destroying that defensive formation.”

“However, you two sisters are actually unable to control that spirit formation. The two of you have wasted the spirit power of these various young friends. You are utter disappointments,” Liangqiu Chengfeng said.

“Senior brother, it is clearly that defensive formation that is too powerful; how could you say that it’s us sisters who do not possess sufficient control over the formation?” Liangqiu Lanyue asked. Evidently, she disapproved of Liangqiu Chengfeng’s interpretation of events.

“The two of you need not say anymore. I will report this matter to master as it is,” Liangqiu Chengfeng was truly angered. There was no longer any leeway in his tone.

Faced with such a Liangqiu Chengfeng, even Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue did not dare to talk back. As for the others, they would naturally be completely quiet too. They were all afraid of offending Liangqiu Chengfeng, that grand individual.

Suddenly, Liangqiu Chengfeng, who was extremely furious changed his voice to that of a friendly tone again. However, his voice was not aimed at the Liangqiu Sisters. Instead, it was aimed at Wuma Shengjie. He asked, “Young friend Wuma Shengjie, are you capable of controlling that formation?”

The crowd was actually not surprised by Liangqiu Chengfeng’s words. They had already anticipated such a thing.

The reason for that was because, of all the people from the younger generation present, it was not only the Liangqiu Sisters that were Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritists. Wuma Shengjie was actually also an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

“Sure,” Wuma Shengjie directly accepted Liangqiu Chengfeng’s request. She stepped forth and replaced Liangqiu Hongyue.

Following that, Liangqiu Chengfeng began the activation of his grand unsealing formation again. Wuma Shengjie also began to activate the spirit formation within the crack to coordinate with Liangqiu Chengfeng to attack the defensive formation from both inside and out.

Another hour passed. Unfortunately, it was another failure.

However, it was worth mentioning that the size of the crack had actually increased twofold.

At that moment, it was not only the people from the younger generation that were astonished; even the grand experts present revealed an astonished look. At the same time as they were astonished, they were also feeling joyous.

At that moment, the crowd all had the same thought in their hearts.

‘Wuma Shengjie is truly worthy of being the prophesied child. His talent is truly exceptional. He is already a rank four Martial Immortal at such a young age. That strength is simply something that very few people among the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s younger generation could compare to.’

‘Furthermore, his talent in terms of world spirit techniques is actually superior to Grandmaster Liangqiu’s two personal disciples.’

‘His talent has been fully revealed. Perhaps, if he is given more time, he will really be able to compete against the current number one genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Linghu Hongfei.’

While the others were astonished by Wuma Shengjie, the Liangqiu Sisters revealed unsightly looks.

Being the youngest disciples of Grandmaster Liangqiu, the twin sisters had enjoyed being revered by others regardless of where they went.

The two of them naturally received such treatment even after arriving here. However, the two of them were no longer the main characters. Because of that prophecy, Wuma Shengjie was the actual main character.

That sort of sensation had brought great discomfort upon the two sisters to begin with. And now, they were actually defeated by Wuma Shengjie in terms of world spirit techniques. This caused the two sisters to feel even more uncomfortable.

Feeling extremely displeased, Liangqiu Hongyue turned her body around in a weird and unexplained manner. She looked to the grand formation that Liangqiu Chengfeng was in and spoke loudly, "Senior brother, perhaps there’s a person here that’s capable of breaching that defensive formation."

Her words caused many people to feel confused.

If one were to ask who amongst the people here could possibly breach that defensive formation, then it would naturally be Liangqiu Chengfeng among those of the older generation, and Wuma Shengjie among those of the younger generation.

That was something that was known to everyone. As such, why would Liangqiu Hongyue suddenly say that?

"Oh? Who are you suggesting?" Liangqiu Chengfeng asked.

The crowd present also became very curious as to exactly who the person that Liangqiu Hongyue said would be able to breach the spirit formation was.

Liangqiu Hongyue pointed her finger to the person standing beside the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. With a loud voice, she said, "Him, Chu Feng."

"What? Him?!"

The crowd present were all surprised upon hearing Liangqiu Hongyue’s words. Even Liangqiu Chengfeng was caught by a surprise. The reason for that was because he didn’t know that Liangqiu Hongyue actually knew Chu Feng.

However, judging from things at that moment, it was clear that Liangqiu Hongyue knew Chu Feng.

That said, the ones that were feeling the most surprised would be none other than those geniuses from the other powers. The reason for that was because they had looked down on Chu Feng from the very start, and had even considered him to be a joke after his declaration to not participate.

The only reason they hadn’t insulted and humiliated Chu Feng was because they took into account that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was present, and they had to give him face.

However, Liangqiu Hongyue actually said that Chu Feng was capable of breaching that defensive formation. This caused them to feel very surprised.

"Hongyue, why do you say that he is able to breach that defensive formation?" Liangqiu Chengfeng asked.

Actually, Liangqiu Chengfeng had determined Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques to be very exceptional, and likely above that of the Liangqiu Sisters, from the very beginning.

The reason why he questioned Liangqiu Hongyue was because he wanted to know how she knew that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were above her and her sister’s.

Faced with Liangqiu Chengfeng’s question, Liangqiu Hongyue revealed a difficult expression. She was clearly feeling very hesitant.

Feeling hesitant, she took a glance at Wuma Shengjie, who stood beside her. Seeing the insufferably arrogant expression on Wuma Shengjie’s face, a determined expression emerged in her eyes.

She opened her mouth and spoke. Although she only said a few words, they were enough to endlessly astonish the crowd.

"That’s because... I’ve been defeated by him."
