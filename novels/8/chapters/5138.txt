Chapter 5138: Grandma’s Whereabouts

By the time Chu Feng returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, those who had escaped from the Darknight Sacred River together with Lord Yuwei and Chu Feng had already dispersed, leaving behind just Lord Yuwei.

Lord Yuwei had made up her mind to follow Chu Feng.

The first thing Chu Feng did upon returning was to show Shengguang Baimei and the others the painting left behind by the mysterious man in hopes that they might recognize the place. After all, that could very well be where his family and friends were.

It was unfortunate that none of them recognized the location depicted in the painting, but Chu Feng wasn’t too disappointed by that. He had only asked them in hopes that they might know something, but he wasn’t banking his hopes on that.

He had long known that it wouldn’t be that easy to find the place depicted in the painting.

Chirp chirp!

A white bird of light suddenly swooped down from the distance, heading in Chu Feng’s direction. It traveled at an extremely fast speed, only to decelerate as it approached the crowd before finally circling around Chu Feng.

This was an information-relaying formation, a particularly formidable one at that. Not only was the bird able to travel at a speed faster than Martial Exalted level cultivators, but it could also enter ancient teleportation formations and relay information across galaxies.

As long as it had locked onto an individual, it would be able to bypass all obstacles to reach its recipient unless it was blocked by a powerful defensive formation.

“There’s news from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan?” Shengguang Baimei asked.

Chu Feng had instructed those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to look into the whereabouts of his grandmother. In response, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief handed him a talisman paper, saying that he would relay the information through a bird of light if he found anything.

On top of that, the bird of light was emanating an aura similar to the talisman paper from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief. That was how they were able to identify the bird’s origin.

“Let me take a look.”

Chu Feng stretched his hand out, and the bird of light immediately settled down on his palm. It quickly morphed into a bundle of light that was around the size of a fingernail, which he then pressed against his head.

The information in the bird of light quickly seeped into Chu Feng’s mind.

It turned out that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief felt extremely guilty toward Chu Feng, which left him determined to accomplish whatever Chu Feng asked of him so as to repay the favor. Unfortunately, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s capability was limited, such that they were unable to uncover anything about Chu Feng’s grandmother.

So, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief approached Song Changsheng, hoping that the latter might know a thing or two.

Under normal circumstances, Song Changsheng wouldn’t meet the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief even if he had an important request, but surprisingly, after the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief revealed his purpose, Song Changsheng revealed himself and even revealed some clues about Chu Feng’s grandmother.

It would appear that while Chu Feng’s grandmother had indeed been in the Nine Souls Galaxy for a period of time, she had already left the place.

After learning of this piece of news, Chu Feng immediately shared it with Shengguang Baimei and the others.

“Young hero Chu Feng, are you intending to head to the Totem Galaxy?” Shengguang Baimei asked. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I was already planning to visit the Totem Galaxy, but it looks like there’s even more reason for me to do so now,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I’m afraid that we won’t be able to accompany you anymore. We’ve received news from the Holy Valley that the Holy Monarch has come out of closed-door training. We’ll have to head back now,” Shengguang Baimei said.

“Elder, please go ahead and do whatever you need to,” Chu Feng replied.

“Chu Feng, I’ll be heading to the Holy Valley together with my master, Lord Baimei, and Lord Buyu. You and Elder Song must take care of yourselves. I heard that the Totem Galaxy is filled with powerful experts. I know that you’re no longer the same person as you used to be, but it’ll be best for you to lie low and avoid conflicts wherever possible,” Chu Lingxi advised.

She knew that Chu Feng had become extremely powerful, but it was the Totem Galaxy they were talking about here. It was impossible for her not to be worried about him.

“Don’t worry. I have always been one to keep a low profile. I’ll surely return safely. I hope that I’ll be able to call you ‘big sister’ when we meet once again in the future,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.

“Don’t tease me. Given your current cultivation, I know that there’s no way I’ll ever have a chance to hear you call me ‘big sister’ anymore.”

Chu Lingxi rolled her eyes.

After saying their farewells, Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, Daoist Niantian, Chu Lingxi, and Gu Mingyuan made their way to the Holy Valley. The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster also returned to the Monstrous Herd Temple.

Chu Feng didn’t immediately set off for the Totem Galaxy. Instead, he told Song Yuwei to remain here while he made a trip to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

Yaoyao had been with him all this while, so he was obliged to send her back to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Also, Chu Feng had promised Zi Ling to visit her after he was done with his affairs.

He couldn’t bring Song Yuwei with him because the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect didn’t allow outsiders on its premises. Furthermore, it was likely that he would be punished for secretly bringing Yaoyao out with him. He didn’t want Lord Yuwei to see him getting punished.

Thus, he decided to head there alone.

With the token he had received from Duan Liufeng, he could reroute any ancient teleportation formation to lead to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Thanks to that, it didn’t take him long to arrive at his destination.

The moment he stepped into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, he could sense that something was amiss. He raised his head and widened his eyes in shock.

“That is…”
