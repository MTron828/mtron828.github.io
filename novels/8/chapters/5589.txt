Chapter 5589: Little Fishy Scared Away

The Wang Clan lived in seclusion on a remote mountain range that spanned a size severalfold of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. This was the difference between an Upper Realm and a Lower Realm.

Those living in a Lower Realm probably thought that the world they lived in was a vast plot of land that they would never be able to fully explore in their entire life, but it wasn’t even the size of a mountain range in the Upper Realm.

It was no wonder why those from the Upper Realm said that those from the Lower Realm were frogs in a well.

There were very few people residing in this mountain range. Finding the Wang Clan here was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

However, Chu Feng wasn’t worried at all, since they would have left many traces behind since they were living there. This was no difficult feat for a world spiritist of Chu Feng’s level.

It didn’t take long for Chu Feng to find the Wang Clan.

The Wang Clan was a huge clan, so their residence was massive. It would be no exaggeration to describe it as a small city. However, their current residence looked a little simple compared to the majestic residence they had in the ancient city.

Even before entering the residence, Chu Feng had already noticed that there were quite a few madmen inside the residence, with the majority of them being youths and children.

“Same thing, Little Fishy,” Chu Feng said.

“Mm.” Little Fishy nodded.

Chu Feng showed himself, whereas Little Fishy followed him in a hidden state.

“Who is it?”

The Wang Clan was well-guarded. As soon as Chu Feng revealed himself, many experts shot out from the residence to surround him.

“I didn’t come with any ill will,” Chu Feng said with a clasped fist while releasing a whiff of his cultivation.

The experts from the Wang Clan widened their eyes in shock upon sensing Chu Feng’s cultivation. One of the elders hurriedly bowed to Chu Feng and said, “Young hero, I am the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief, Wang Chengyang. Please pardon me for not knowing who you are.”

The Wang Clan’s Clan Chief kept his waist bent, not daring to raise his head lest he offend Chu Feng. The other Wang Clansmen quickly stowed away their weapons and assumed the same position as their clan chief.

They were terrified.

It was hard not to feel that way when the strongest amongst them, the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief, was only at early Martial Exalted level, whereas Chu Feng was at rank three Half-God level.

“I didn’t come bearing ill will,” Chu Feng said as he revealed his intention of uncovering the truth behind what happened back then.

Instead of directly answering the question, the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief asked, “Young hero, I don’t mean any disrespect, but may I know which sect are you from? Otherwise, may I know the name of your master?”

“I am Chu Feng, but it isn’t convenient for me to divulge where I am from,” Chu Feng said.

The Wang Clan’s Clan Chief frowned.

“Wang Clan’s Clan Chief, are you finding me unworthy of knowing about your clan’s affairs?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s definitely not the case! Young hero Chu Feng, I would never dare to look down on you. Truth be told, I have my difficulties too,” the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief said before diving deeper into what happened back then.

The one who had dug the well was the granddaughter of the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief. Cultivators of their level could easily dig out a well with a metal spade without resorting to special means, so the granddaughter dug it out without anyone realizing.

But that night, the granddaughter suddenly began shouting like a madman, but by then, she had already lost her mind and couldn’t be communicated with anymore.

The Wang Clan quickly investigated the matter and found a well in the granddaughter’s quarters, as well as something in her room that shouldn’t have belonged to her.

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked, figuring that the item was likely to be the culprit.

The Wang Clan’s Clan Chief opened his palm, and with his spirit power, he manifested a copper can that was around ten centimeters tall.

“Milord, this is what the item looks like. We suspect that my granddaughter might have dug it out of the well, but we didn’t think that it was related to my granddaughter’s madness back then. It was only when more of our juniors went insane and our older, weaker clansmen started passing away that we realized that something was going on.

“It was weird as the other clansmen were unaffected by this phenomenon, which led us to think that it might be something inauspicious at work. We were able to confirm later on that it’s indeed the doing of that item. We should have thrown it away right away, but I got greedy, thinking that it might be a treasure that could bring our Wang Clan to a greater height. So, I moved our clan here, thinking that it would be fine once I bury the treasure in the mountains, away from where our clansmen are.

“I was naive. The item continued to haunt us. Even when I have buried it in the mountains, far away from our other clansmen, our juniors still continue to descend into madness. I was greedy. I failed to decipher the item despite so many years, but I caused so much suffering to our juniors.” The Wang Clan’s Clan Chief started sobbing at this point.

“Where’s that copper can?” Chu Feng asked.

“Just a few days ago, while I was studying the item, an expert suddenly appeared and occupied the cave where I hid the item. She’s extremely powerful; I dare not approach her. Young hero, I didn’t ask for your identity because I looked down on you, but because I can feel just how strong that woman is.

“I have already thought things through by now. That item doesn’t belong to my Wang Clan, and I’m planning to take my clansmen away from here. Young hero, even if you’re interested in the item, I’d suggest that you not seek it out yourself but instead have someone else look into it on your behalf,” the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Is that woman still in the cave?” Chu Feng asked.

“I checked earlier in the morning. She’s still there,” the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“What does she look like? Do you know her cultivation level?” Chu Feng asked.

“I wasn’t able to see her face, but her hair is slightly messy. I’m unable to determine her exact cultivation either, but she’s extremely powerful. I’d say that she’s even stronger than you, young hero,” the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Can you tell where the item is hidden?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course.” the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief took out a map and passed it to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng glanced at the map, but instead of leaving right away, he instructed, “Call of the clansmen who have lost their minds over.”

The Wang Clan’s Clan Chief was initially confused, but when he saw Chu Feng construct a formation, it dawned on him that Chu Feng might be planning to help them. Thus, he excitedly summoned all of those who had lost their minds.

Chu Feng’s formation indeed served to treat the Wang Clansmen from their affliction.

As soon as the formation was activated, a dark purple aura drifted out from those who had lost their minds. Shortly after, those who had lost their minds began regaining their sanity. This sight delighted the Wang Clansmen. Cries of delight echoed ceaselessly.

They had tried seeking help for their affliction, but it was to no avail. They had already resigned themselves to the possibility that those who had lost their minds would never regain their sanity.

Chu Feng attempted to seal off some of the dark purple aura to keep as a sample, knowing that it was the culprit behind the Wang Clansmen’s madness, but to his dismay, the dark purple aura dissipated too fast for him to even contain a whiff of it.

This was peculiar, considering that it actually dissipated inside his formation.

“It looks like that item is not to be made light of,” Chu Feng remarked with a sigh.

He took out a Cosmos Sack and handed it over to the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I’ll take the treasure away with me if I find it. Take this as your compensation,” Chu Feng said.

“Young hero, that won’t do. You saved so many of our juniors. I can never repay this debt of gratitude, so how can I accept anything else from you?” the Wang Clan’s Clan Chief said.

However, Chu Feng rose into the air and took his leave.

The Wang Clan’s Clan Chief opened the Cosmos Sack to look, and the other Wang Clansmen gathered around out of curiosity. Out of embarrassment, they had tried to reject the gift, but they knew that a gift from someone of Chu Feng’s stature was bound to be worth a fortune.

“My gosh.”

The crowd was taken aback. Some even broke down in tears. They had known whatever was inside the Cosmos Sack was bound to be worth a fortune, but they didn’t think that it would be this valuable. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The treasures inside the Cosmos Sack were enough for their Wang Clan to climb to a new height. While the item they found in the well didn’t strike them gold, it had indirectly brought them a fortuitous encounter.

“We’ll forever remember our debt to young hero Chu Feng.”

The Wang Clan’s Clan Chief kneeled down together with his clansmen and kowtowed in the direction Chu Feng had left.

…

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was heading to the cave together with Little Fishy. He knew that his opponent wouldn’t be easy, so he made sure to properly conceal himself, even resorting to Divine Concealment.

There was indeed someone in the cavern. It was a white-haired woman dressed in black robes, but her messy hair covered most of her facial features.

All of a sudden, the woman looked toward where Chu Feng and Little Fishy were as if sensing their presence, resulting in a meeting of their gazes. It was only then that the two of them got a closer look at her facial features.

The woman’s face was pale, devoid of any redness, but she was still a beauty. It was just that her eyes were exceptionally fierce, looking more like the eyes of a ferocious beast rather than a human.

“It’s her?!”

Upon catching a proper look at the woman’s face, the usually bold Little Fishy immediately grabbed Chu Feng’s wrist and fled.
