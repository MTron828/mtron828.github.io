Chapter 3624 - Divine Armament Cemetery

“Yuanzhi, it’s enough,” said Wuming Xiongmo.

It was not only Wuming Xiongmo. At that moment, Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun had all appeared beside Chu Feng.

Judging from this, even if Wuming Xiongmo didn’t stop Wuming Yuanzhi, the three of them would’ve stopped him.

“Wuming Yuanzhi, you’re being too excessive. Chu Feng doesn’t want to fight with you, why do you insist on forcing him to fight you?” Kong Ci’s long brows were narrowed into a deep frown as she lashed out ruthlessly at Wuming Yuanzhi.

“Big brother Yuanzhi, what you’re doing is truly bad,” Even Long Ning raised her little fist.

“Wuming Yuanzhi, how shameless are you? My brother Chu Feng is able to tie with even Linghu Hongfei. Did you really think that you’d be a match for him?”

“If you’re so capable, go and challenge Linghu Hongfei. Are you capable of defeating him? Do you dare to challenge him?” Kong Tianhui’s behavior toward Wuming Yuanzhi was even worse than Kong Ci. He actually directly cursed out at him.

“Since when were you allowed to speak? Who do you think you are?” Wuming Yuanzhi pointed at Kong Tianhui.

“What’s this? If you dare insult my big brother again, I will tear your mouth apart!”

Seeing her older brother being criticized, Kong Ci no longer held back anymore. She directly released her aura, and even activated her Divine Power to increase her cultivation to rank three Exalted. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“That’s enough. Everyone, calm yourselves. We are currently faced with a major enemy, and should be thinking of a way to face them, instead of internal strife,” Wuming Xiongmo said.

“Tsk…”

Although the crowd showed no signs of reconciliation even after Wuming Xiongmo spoke, they no longer made the situation worse.

“Brother Chu Feng, I am truly sorry,” Wuming Xiongmo said to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth and revealed a faint smile. He said, “You shouldn’t be the one apologizing.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng’s gaze suddenly turned cold. He looked to Wuming Yuanzhi.

“What’s this? You’re trying to continue? Not only do you disrespect me, but you even want me to apologize to you?” Wuming Yuanzhi stared at Chu Feng angrily.

“Respect? Someone like you needs respect?”

“Very well. You can wait, I will let you know later what respect means,” said Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was also feeling very displeased. After all, he was beaten to a state of injury for no reason at all. If it were anyone else, they would also be displeased. Besides, Chu Feng was never someone to accept losses.

“Very well, I’ll wait for you.”

“I shall see how you, someone who relies solely on your world spirit, dares act this arrogant,” Wuming Yuanzhi spoke with a mocking tone.

Chu Feng no longer bothered to argue with Wuming Yuanzhi. Chu Feng was angered because he had attacked him. However, he would not be angry from being ridiculed by him.

After all, having experienced all those things, Chu Feng had already matured a lot. Low level provocations like what Wuming Yuanzhi said earlier were simply unable to evoke his anger.

“Everyone, young friends, why was it so noisy?”

Suddenly, an old man arrived outside the entrance.

“Lord Shoujian, what brings you here?”

[1. Shoujian = Guardian Sword. Not sure if that’s his title or his name yet.]

Seeing that old man, even those geniuses walked toward him to respectfully bow to and greet him.

“This old man naturally came here bringing good news. Hmm…”

“This young friend, could he be…?”

Suddenly, that old man’s gaze landed on Chu Feng’s body. A surprised look appeared in his aged eyes.

“Brother Chu Feng, allow me to introduce you. This is the guardian of the Divine Armament Villa, our beloved and respected Lord Shoujian.”

“Lord Shoujian, this brother of mine is rather extraordinary. He is the person who defeated all the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations and managed to fight Linghu Hongfei to a tie in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, Chu Xuanyuan’s son, Chu Feng,” With a proud expression on his face, Kong Tianhui introduced Chu Feng.

“My, it really is Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

“It must be said, when looked at closely, you do resemble Chu Xuanyuan a lot.”

After verifying that it was Chu Feng, that Lord Shoujian became particularly cordial.

“Senior, you know my father?” asked Chu Feng.

“More than knowing, your father had also been to my Divine Armament Villa before. Furthermore, he took away my Divine Armament Villa’s best weapon, the Exalted Armament Divine Cremation Spear,” said Lord Shoujian.

“Ah? Lord Shoujian, didn’t you say that the best weapon in the Divine Armament Villa is an Incomplete Exalted Armament? How could there be an Exalted Armament?”

At that moment, the people of the younger generation present all revealed curious looks.

“We had an Exalted Armament in the past. However, it was taken away by young friend Chu Feng’s father. Right now, all we have left are Incomplete Exalted Armaments,” said Lord Shoujian.

“Oh, that’s right, this old man came here to inform you all of some good news. You are truly lucky. Our Divine Armament Villa’s Divine Armament Cemetery is open,” said Lord Shoujian.

“Lord Shoujian, is what you said true?” Those people of the younger generation immediately became excited upon hearing those words.

Kong Tianhui informed Chu Feng about the Divine Armament Villa and the Divine Armament Cemetery.

The Divine Armament Villa possessed a wondrous place by the name of Divine Armament Cemetery.

The Divine Armament Cemetery would open at random. It might open in several centuries, several decades, or several years.

However, one could only enter it when it was open. That was why it was known to be a wondrous place.

The previous opening of the Divine Armament Cemetery had not been long, only three years past.

Normally, since it had only been three years since the Divine Armament Cemetery opened, the next opening would take at least two more years, for a total of five years. However, it was actually open at that moment. This greatly surprised the crowd, and brought them great excitement.

The reason why they were so excited was not because of the Divine Armament Cemetery’s opening. Instead, they were excited due to the treasures within the Divine Armament Cemetery.

There were countless blackiron weapons inside the Divine Armament Cemetery. Everyone that entered it would be able to pull out one such blackiron weapon.

Once one pulled out a weapon, one would be sent out from the Divine Armament Cemetery by its power.

Furthermore, only after one left the Divine Armament Cemetery would the blackiron weapon shatter and reveal its true form. The blackiron weapon might be an extremely precious Incomplete Exalted Armament. However, it was also possible for it to be a completely useless piece of scrap iron.

Naturally, the probability of pulling out a piece of scrap iron was the greatest, and an Incomplete Exalted Armament the smallest.

Normally, if one could pull out an Immortal Armament, one would be extremely lucky.

However, due to the fact that there was a possibility of obtaining an Incomplete Exalted Armament, and it was even possible for it to be a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament, even those geniuses of noble status yearned to enter the Divine Armament Cemetery.

Besides, only the people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age would be able to enter the Divine Armament Cemetery.

Thus, even though they were geniuses that did not lack weapons, they were still very fond of entering the Divine Armament Cemetery to test out their luck.

As for Lord Shoujian, he was someone with a special identity.

Actually, there was only a single true successor to the Divine Armament Villa. As for that person, he was Lord Shoujian.

That said, he was not the master of the Divine Armament Villa. He was merely the person guarding the Divine Armament Villa.

However, as the master of the Divine Armament Villa possessed a superb relationship with the Three Cities when he was alive, the Three Cities had come to the Divine Armament Villa to protect it now that he had died.

Currently, there were experts from Monstrous Holy City, Divine Body Royal City and Ancestral Martial Dragon City present in the Divine Armament Villa, guarding it.

Thus, even though Lord Shoujian was the only true successor to the Divine Armament Villa, no one dared to come to the Divine Armament Villa to cause a disturbance.

After all, even the Ancestral Martial Starfield needed to give the Three Cities face. That held true even more for the other powers and people.

Over time, apart from the people from the Three Cities and the Ancestral Martial Starfield, no one dared to approach the Divine Armament Villa.

Even though Lord Shoujian was the only true successor to the Divine Armament Villa, the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield already viewed the Divine Armament Villa as the territory of the Three Cities.

That said, Lord Shoujian actually possessed a rather strong cultivation himself. He was a peak Exalted.

Ignoring his strength, merely by his special identity and how cordially he treated others, even those geniuses from the Three Cities and the Starfield Master Realm were extremely respectful to him.

“Lord Shoujian, in that case, are we allowed to enter the Divine Armament Cemetery now?” Kong Ci asked with excitement.

“Those younger generations from the All-heaven Starfield are soon to arrive, no? Let’s wait for them to come to enter together,” Lord Shoujian said.

“Lord Shoujian, let’s not wait. They are outsiders. We should enjoy this sort of fortunate thing ourselves. Why must we always bring them along?” Kong Tianhui said.

“Kong Tianhui, what you said is incorrect. Ignoring the fact that our Ancestral Martial Starfield has a friendly relationship with the All-heaven Starfield, all the guests of the Divine Armament Villa will be allowed to enter the Divine Armament Cemetery to pull out a weapon when it opens, as that is the rule established by the ancestors of the Divine Armament Villa. How could we refuse to follow the rules?” said Lord Shoujian.

“But aren’t they not here yet? It could only be said that they are unlucky,” said Kong Tianhui.

“But they’re about to arrive. Since the Divine Armament Cemetery will remain open for some time, let’s just wait for them,” said Lord Shoujian.

“Okay, okay, okay. You’re the one who gets to make decisions here,” Kong Tianhui sighed helplessly.
