Chapter 4970: Unwelcomed

Under Yaoyao’s lead, Chu Feng and his group arrived at the entrance of a city. The city was huge in size, but it was a recent construction. World spiritists of Chu Feng’s caliber could easily conjure such a city with a wave of their hand.&nbsp;

The presence of this city provided two important pieces of information to Chu Feng.&nbsp;

First, he could sense the Ancient Era’s aura coming from the land where the city was constructed, hinting that there was an Ancient Era remnant in the vicinity.

That was good news to Chu Feng because it wasn’t the same remnant that Shengguang Baimei knew of. There was a good chance that the Lady of Dao Sea and the others still weren’t aware of the ancient remnant discovered by the Holy Valley yet.&nbsp;

Second, he could sense the aura of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator coming from the city. As the individual didn’t attempt to conceal his aura in the least, Chu Feng could tell that it wasn’t from the Lady of Dao Sea.&nbsp;

Things could potentially get dangerous if the rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator was hostile to them.&nbsp;

Chu Feng also noticed several familiar faces gathered around the entrance of the city. They were the disciples of the Lady of Dao Sea. He had met all of them, and he had a strong impression of one of them who went by the name of Song Feifei.

Aside from the disciples of the Lady of Dao Sea, there were also thirteen other juniors from other powers.&nbsp;

They were standing together in front of the city entrance, seemingly discussing something important. These juniors didn’t conceal their cultivation, so Chu Feng was able to get a sensing of their strength.&nbsp;

One of them had reached Martial Exalted level, but he was only at rank one. The others were all at Utmost Exalted level, with the weakest of them being at rank five Utmost Exalted level.&nbsp;

They carried tokens on their waists which revealed the organizations they were associated with. They were namely from Starspecter Valley, &nbsp;Soaringflow Heaven Sect, and Silver Crane Hall.&nbsp;

They were wearing exquisite robes with unique designs.&nbsp;

Those from Starspecter Valley wore robes that resembled the starry night sky. Those from Soaringflow Heaven Sect&nbsp;had robes that looked like a flowing waterfall. Last but not least, those from Silver Crane Hall had a silver crane that looked realistic and divine embroidered into their robes.&nbsp;

It was worth noting that these were all world spiritist robes, evident from the world spiritist aura infused in them. All of these juniors were Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.&nbsp;

It was likely that they had already grasped Dragon Transformation Sensation, just that Chu Feng couldn’t tell what level they were at till they released their spirit power.&nbsp;

“Who are they? I have never heard of any of them before. None of them are powers from the Nine Souls Galaxy. Daoist Niantian, do you know them?”&nbsp;

Shengguang Baimei sent a voice transmission to Daoist Niantian and Chu Feng.&nbsp; Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“They appear to be subordinate powers of the Situ World Spiritist Clan,” Daoist Niantian replied.

“The Situ World Spiritist Clan?”

Chu Feng’s heart jolted upon hearing those four words. He had asked about the origins of the Situ World Spiritist Clan during their idle chatter, and he found out that they were a powerhouse from the Totem Galaxy.

To be exact, they were just rulers of a Starfield, but one had to know that the Totem Galaxy was nothing like the Nine Souls Galaxy or Holy Light Galaxy. It was one of the top galaxies of the vast world of cultivation.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan was a behemoth with numerous God-cloak World Spiritist and Half-God level cultivators in its ranks. It was due to their overwhelming strength that Shengguang Baimei was concerned when he heard about the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s ambitions to rule the eastern region.&nbsp;

Shengguang Buyu even rushed back to the Holy Valley to inform their Holy Monarch of this matter.&nbsp;

If the Situ World Spiritist Clan were to really attack the eastern region, it would be a calamity for both the Nine Souls Sacred Clan and the Holy Valley.

Chu Feng couldn’t help but wonder what were the ties between the Lady of Dao Sea and the Situ World Spiritist Clan. While he was still deep in thought, he continued proceeding closer to the city with Yaoyao.

Due to that, the juniors also noticed Chu Feng.&nbsp;

“Who are you?”

The first one to notice Chu Feng was a man from Starspecter Valley. He was the only Martial Exalted level cultivator within the group. There was a hint of killing intent in his eyes as he questioned Chu Feng, as if he wouldn’t hesitate to kill Chu Feng if the latter failed to give a satisfactory answer.&nbsp;

“Chu Feng?”

Due to the commotion, Song Feifei and the others also noticed Chu Feng. Upon seeing him, they quickly rushed over to his side.&nbsp;

“Chu Fengm what brings you here? Did my master invite you?” Song Feifei asked with a bright smile.&nbsp;

The other disciples of the Dao Sea also revealed cheerful faces.

“Ladies, are you acquainted with him?”

The man from Starspecter Valley and the others also came over, but their positioning made it clear that they were encircling him. Their eyes were filled with wariness as if they were looking at a thief.&nbsp;

They didn’t welcome Chu Feng here at all.

“Looks like I’m not welcomed here?” Chu Feng asked.&nbsp;

“Welcomed? It looks like you don’t know what kind of position you’re in. You better honestly tell us how you get here, or else you need not dream of walking out of here alive!” the man from Starspecter Valley sneered.&nbsp;
