Chapter 3900 - Dog Nation

Chu Feng then asked them about some other things.

For example, he asked them what the cultivation of the strongest person of the General Clan was, if the people from the Royal Clan had cultivations superior to the General Clan, and various other questions...

However, they only knew that a cultivation of Utmost Exalted was the baseline to enter the General Clan, and had no idea what the cultivations of the strongest person in the General Clan was. As for the cultivation of the Royal Clan, they knew even less.

Chu Feng had also asked them about the Ancient Era.

However, their answer was that they too did not know anything about the Ancient Era.

Although their ancestors had lived through the Ancient Era, they actually knew nothing about it.

The matters of the Ancient Era were actually also a mystery to those Ancient Era’s organisms.

This made Chu Feng even more curious as to exactly what had happened in the Ancient Era.

Since the Ancient Era’s organisms were able to survive, why were the humans of the Ancient Era unable to continue living?

This was simply unreasonable.

After gaining nothing from further inquiries, Chu Feng decided to explore things himself. Thus, he asked how to enter their so-called nation.

It turned out that deep inside the cave were teleportation gates.

Different teleportation gates would teleport a person to different nations.

However, people could only enter the teleportation gate corresponding to the clan they belonged to.

In simpler terms, they needed to authenticate their identity. Without a special identity, one could not enter the teleportation gates.

In other words, Chu Feng was simply unable to enter their nations using the teleportation gates.

Fortunately, the teleportation gates for the Dog Nation were somewhat different, and did not have any restrictions.

Anyone could enter the Dog Nation’s teleportation gate and be teleported to the Dog Nation.

Furthermore, the various nations were interconnected. Thus, even if Chu Feng entered the Dog Nation, he would still be able to reach the Royal Nation through it.

The only troublesome aspect was that he would have to first pass through the People Nation, Soldier Nation and General Nation in order to reach the Royal Nation.

“Milord, you said you’re planning to enter the Dog Nation?!”

Gou Za revealed a look of surprise when he heard Chu Feng asking him where the Dog Nation gate was.

“Your daddy I have never been to the Dog Nation before. I want to go and check it out, what’s wrong with that?” asked Chu Feng.

“No, no, no, there’s nothing wrong, nothing wrong. Our Dog Nation welcomes Milord.”

“Milord, please follow me. This lowly one shall guide you,” Gou Za said as he turned around.

“Gou Za, you... you’re going to return?”

When Gou Za began to guide Chu Feng, his companions reacted with surprise.

“I’ll return right away. It’s more important that I guide Milord.”

As Gou Za spoke, he put away his tools and began to guide Chu Feng.

That Gou Za seemed particularly excited after learning that Chu Feng was really planning to enter the Dog Nation.

‘Why is this guy so overjoyed? Could he be planning some malicious trick in his mind?’

Although this thought crossed Chu Feng’s mind, he was not afraid.

After all, Gou Za’s cultivation was simply too weak. Ignoring the fact that Chu Feng had the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb’s spirit formation, even if he didn’t, his own cultivation would be more than enough to take care of Gou Za.

Following Gou Za, Chu Feng soon arrived at a cave.

To be exact, it was a dog cave. The reason why it was a dog cave was because one needed to crawl in order to enter it, and would have to continue to crawl after entering it.

This dog cave was simply too narrow, so narrow that it could only fit a single person.

In other words, if the person trying to enter the dog cave was slightly overweight, they would not be able to pass through the cave.

Most importantly, the walls of the cave were extremely firm. Even with Chu Feng’s cultivation, he would still not be able to expand the cave.

Seeing this dog cave, Chu Feng finally realized why Gou Za and others were so thin.

After all, if they were any fatter, they would not be able to crawl out of the dog cave.

Upon arriving at the Dog Cave, Gou Za began to crawl into the cave without any hesitation.

With Gou Za leading the way, Chu Feng didn’t bother overthinking things.

As a man, one should be able to submit or stand tall as required. It was merely a dog cave, how could one allow such a thing to baffle them?

Crawling through the dog cave, a spirit formation gate appeared deep inside the cave.

That spirit formation gate was rather different from the spirit formation gates Chu Feng had seen before. It was pitch black, and looked like a black hole. However, an intense Ancient Era’s aura was being emitted from the black hole.

Truth be told, Chu Feng felt slightly afraid upon seeing the gate.

The gate simply resembled the entrance to the abyss.

However, after seeing Gou Za crawling into the gate, Chu Feng did not hesitate too much, and also crawled into it.

“Buzz~~~”

Actually, Chu Feng did not crawl into the gate. He had only approached the gate, then was suddenly sucked into it.

Entering the gate, Chu Feng entered a place of darkness. He felt extremely stifled there. He was unable to control himself, and could only allow himself to drift with the flow.

He did not know where he would be brought to because everything was pitch-black. Chu Feng was unable to see anything, unable to see the slightest bit of light, and unable to see Gou Za, who had entered the cave ahead of him.

Being in a place like that, anyone would feel despair.

That place simply resembled a prison.

‘I couldn’t have fallen for a trap, right?’

This thought had entered Chu Feng’s mind.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s body was drawn to an enormous power. Following that, he actually broke free from the pitch-black darkness.

The instant he broke free from the darkness, Chu Feng regained control of his body.

Chu Feng immediately began moving, and soon landed on the ground.

Upon landing, Chu Feng discovered Gou Za lying before him, looking at him with a look of admiration.

“Milord is truly amazing, you’re actually able to stand up immediately. Hehe, unlike us, we all have to exit on our stomachs.” Gouza praised as he continued lying on the ground.

Chu Feng did not bother to pay any attention to him. The reason for that was because his attention had been completely captured by the world before him.

The sky there was muddled and dark. It seemed completely overcast. However, there were actually no clouds blocking the sky. Instead, the sky was dark and gloomy to begin with. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

There was not a single star in the gloomy sky. One could see no sign of the moon either. This caused the world to appear particularly oppressive.

Most importantly, there was not a single decent-looking house to be seen.

That place was filled with tents. The tents were located in different regions. Likely, those tents were the residences of the people there.

What brought Chu Feng the greatest disbelief was that there was no trace of a flower or tree, or even flowing water to be seen. Yet, there were mountains.

Giant mountain peaks could be seen in the distance.

However, those mountains were not covered in greenery. Instead, they were mountains composed of piled up trash.

Every region in the world was emitting a stink.

The source of the stink were the giant mountains of trash.

However, it just so happened that silhouettes could be seen all over the trash mountains. They were searching for something.

Occasionally, someone would discover something, and be overjoyed.

There were also people scrambling and fighting over the discovered things.

Chu Feng knew what they were doing.

Although the enormous mountains were piled up trash in Chu Feng’s eyes, they were treasure mines for the Dog Clansmen.

Those were most likely the leftovers of the cultivation resources the other nations had used. That was why they were discarded there.

However, even though they were used cultivation resources and were seen as trash by others, they were extremely precious in the eyes of the Dog Clansmen.
