Chapter 5788: I’ll Be Severing This Arm of Yours

Everyone in the ancient hall looked at Chu Feng with a dazed expression, as if they had been petrified. It took a moment for them to snap out of it.

Little Fishy blinked her eyes in bewilderment. She couldn’t believe that a Half-God level cultivator penetrated the defense of a True God level cultivator. This was unheard of!

Weng!

Chu Feng pulled out his sword and backed off.

A tremendous surge of energy flowed into Huangfu Shengyu’s chest, repairing his body. Even his weakened aura was swiftly recovering.

It was the token!

The token that was in Huangfu Shengyu’s chest disintegrated, turning into a bundle of energy that saved his life one more time.

“You have used up the trump card your predecessor left behind. Who’s going to save you now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Ha…” Huangfu Shengyu stood up and laughed sinisterly. “Chu Feng, you sure are a bundle of surprises. It was worth coming to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith for you. I take back my words. You didn’t disappoint me. I can give up on the Genesis Bloodline, but I’ll be taking that red lightning power of yours!” Huangfu Shengyu said.

His eyes turned pitch black. His face started to rot, as black spikes rose from beneath his skin. His entire body was undergoing a similar change too. It felt like he was turning from a human into a monster.

“Young master, you mustn’t!” Huangfu Jiangyao exclaimed as he rushed forward to stop it.

However, Huangfu Shangyang stopped him, saying, “We have no other choice now. Do you want our young master to die instead?”

Huangfu Jiangyao looked at Chu Feng with a complicated expression. Chu Feng’s aura hadn’t changed in the least, but the red lightning he emanated exerted tremendous pressure on them. He couldn’t believe that Chu Feng, despite being only at rank eight Half-God level, was able to corner them so far.

Huangfu Shangyang was right. They didn’t have a choice anymore.

“What a formidable forbidden medicine. It was likely refined from a special monstrous beast. The Ancient Era’s Heavenly Clans do have formidable means. However, the backlash is bound to be severe as well, so much so that it might even affect his bloodline. He must be desperate,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

The forbidden medicine was indeed potent, and it significantly boosted Huangfu Shengyu’s fighting prowess, but the backlash would affect his bloodline and future cultivation.

The fact that Huangfu Shengyu, who had always been proud of his Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, had resorted to this forbidden medicine showed that he was desperate.

Chu Feng could tell as much too, but he didn’t say a word. He reached into his Cosmos Sack and pulled out a spear crackling with lightning.

The three Huangfus widened their eyes in shock upon seeing the spear.

“What did you do to Huangfu Fanni?” Huangfu Jiangyao angrily asked.

“I killed him,” Chu Feng replied.

“You dare to kill our Huangfu Heavenly Clansman? Our Huangfu Heavenly Clan will hunt you to the end of the world!” Huangfu Jiangyao roared.

“Are you ill? Did staying underground for too long make you dumb?” Chu Feng rolled his eyes in disdain. He couldn’t even be bothered to elaborate on it.

Xianhai Shaoyu chuckled upon hearing those words.

Huangfu Shengyu had already threatened to kill them many times now; the grudge between them was irreconcilable. It was meaningless to bring out the name of their clan right now.

“Chu Feng, are you going to fight me with our God Armament? You must be poor,” Huangfu Shengyu sneered.

“Not at all. I just want to show you I have a God Armament too,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle before casually tossing the God Armament aside.

“Brother Chu Feng, what are you doing?”

Long Chengyu and the others were confused. The same went for Huangfu Shengyu. They didn’t understand why Chu Feng would bring out the God Armament, only to toss it away.

“I don’t need a God Armament to deal with you,” Chu Feng said.

“Arrogant!” Huangfu Shengyu roared.

He brandished his spear and unleashed several lightning beasts on Chu Feng. He had unleashed this attack before, but its prowess was far stronger than before. The forbidden medicine was working its magic.

Sensing danger, Long Chengyu and the others quickly backed off. Even the shockwaves from a battle of this caliber could take their lives.

“There’s no need for that,” Xianhai Shaoyu said as his eyes remained focused on Chu Feng.

The lightning beasts were dispersed by a strong blow, causing shockwaves to rage in the ancient hall. However, not a single shockwave rippled in their direction. Chu Feng had blocked them on their behalf.

After dealing with the lightning beasts, Chu Feng charged at Huangfu Shengyu, but this time around, he didn’t use Divine Flitting but instead moved at his own speed. As powerful as Divine Flitting was, he couldn’t keep executing it.

Not wanting to engage Chu Feng in close-quarter combat, Huangfu Shengyu hurriedly retreated while unleashing more lightning beasts.

However, Chu Feng was unstoppable. Without resorting to any special means or martial skill, just with his rank eight Half-God level cultivation and an Exalted Armament, he easily dealt with all of Huangfu Shengyu’s attacks and finally arrived before him.

Chu Feng thrust his sword toward Huangfu Shengyu’s shoulder. The latter hurriedly raised his spear to block it, but Chu Feng made no attempt to change the trajectory of his attack, choosing to follow through with it.

Clang!

The Exalted Armament and the God Armament collided, causing shockwaves to ripple outward. An Exalted Armament should have shattered before a God Armament, but the Immemorial Hero’s Sword held its ground against Huangfu Shengyu’s spear.

Chu Feng was holding his Exalted Armament with a single hand, but Huangfu Shengyu, despite blocking the attack with both hands, gritted his teeth with a strained expression, a clear sign that he was struggling.

Huangfu Shengyu’s arms were two times larger than usual under the effects of the forbidden medicine, but they trembled helplessly before Chu Feng’s might. He could only watch helplessly as Chu Feng’s Immemorial Hero’s Sword slowly pressed down on his shoulder.

“I’ll be taking your arm,” Chu Feng coldly.

He swung his blade backward, slicing off Huangfu Shengyu’s left arm.
