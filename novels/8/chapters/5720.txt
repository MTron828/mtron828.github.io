Chapter 5720: Long Lin’s Killing Intent

Chu Feng had been analyzing Long Lin as well, and his analysis went even deeper than the Heaven-devouring Qilin’s.

In terms of raw physical strength, Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline was a force to be reckoned with too, if not for his weak cultivation, but he could further enhance his strength with a formation as a world spiritist.

As for Long Lin, he had an obvious weakness to exploit, assuming that his love for Long Xue was real.

Chu Feng already had a plan in mind. He had spent the last few observing to figure out how he should put the plan into action, and everything was in place now.

“Elder Long Lin, you shouldn’t underestimate me.”

Chu Feng began constructing three different formations. None of these three formations were easy to construct; it took him a long time to complete them despite having spent a long time preparing for them. He concealed these formations inside his body.

In his next meeting with Long Lin, he asked, “Elder, how is Elder Long Xue faring?”

“Her condition isn’t good, but it’s stable for the time being. What’s with the abrupt question?” Long Lin asked.

“While the dragon essence’s energy has significantly mellowed down from before, it’s proving to be difficult to completely tame it. Elder Long Xue is currently in a weakened state, so I’m worried that it might be hard for her to withstand the violence left in the dragon essence’s energy.”

“But… we still have to give it a try.”

Long Lin didn’t doubt Chu Feng’s words, as he had known that it was impossible to fully tame the dragon energy’s essence. It was from the ancestral dragon, after all.

“While my cultivation is lacking, I have faith in my world spiritist techniques. Over the last few days of observation, I have figured out some of the dragon essence’s traits.” Chu Feng took out a brush and a piece of paper before proceeding to jot down a list of items of specific traits. “Are you able to obtain these?”

“I should be able to do this. Are you using these items to forge something?” Long Lin asked.

“That’s right. I believe that the dragon essence’s energy will pose a threat to Elder Long Xue even after it’s fully nurtured, but that can be circumvented by forging a pill that imitates the traits of the dragon essence. This is a pill imitating the dragon essence, after all, so I’ll need treasures exclusive to your Totem Dragon Clan.

“Don’t worry, I understand that Elder Long Xue is in a frail condition. I dare guarantee that the pill won’t hurt her in any way, even if it’s ineffective. To be a bit more arrogant, I’m confident that the pill will work,” Chu Feng said.

Long Lin considered the matter before finally relenting with a nod, saying, “I’ll gather the items.”

Long Lin soon returned with the items Chu Feng had requested, and they were all invaluable treasures. These were resources that not even the upper echelons of the Totem Dragon Clan could enjoy.

No one sane, including the previous Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, would take out these invaluable treasures for Chu Feng to experiment with. However, Long Lin had no hesitation in doing so. He was willing to do anything for Long Xue’s sake.

He had usurped the clan chief’s position in order to save Long Xue, after all.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I trust you a lot. You are someone who has inherited the Ruler’s Bloodline. Let’s see what kind of surprises you can bring me,” Long Lin said as he passed the items to Chu Feng.

“Don’t worry, elder. I dare not guarantee it, but I’ll try my best to improve Elder Long Xue’s condition,” Chu Feng said before he began constructing a formation.

It took him half a day to forge a golden pill. The golden pill gave off the same aura as the dragon essence, but there was not the slightest hint of violence in its energy.

“Please inspect it, elder. If it’s fine with you, I’ll fuse it into Elder Long Xue’s body and begin her treatment,” Chu Feng said as he passed the golden pill to Long Lin.

Long Lin carefully inspected the pill. He couldn’t find anything wrong with the pill, but he still asked out of worry, “Young friend Chu Feng, are you certain that there’ll be no adverse effects on Long Xue even if it fails?”

“Elder, I guarantee that it won’t hurt Elder Long Xue. You may behead me if it causes any harm to Elder Long Xue,” Chu Feng said.

“All right, young friend Chu Feng. I believe you,” Long Lin said.

He brought Chu Feng to the pavilion amidst the clouds, where Long Xue lay.

“Elder, if it’s fine with you, I need to borrow some energy from the recovery formation here too,” Chu Feng said.

“Will it impair the recovery formation?” Long Lin asked.

“It’ll deplete some of the recovery formation’s energy, but just a portion of it. Elder Long Xue should be able to wake up if I successfully fuse this pill into her, and that should render this recovery formation useless,” Chu Feng said.

“Xue’er will wake up if you succeed? Are you certain?” Long Lin’s expression changed upon hearing those words.

“I can’t say so with absolute certainty, but I am confident,” Chu Feng said.

“I trust you, young friend Chu Feng.” Long Lin was excited.

He had sought out countless powerful world spiritists to treat Long Xue—some of them were even more formidable than Taishi Xingzhong—but no one could help her. However, the golden pill Chu Feng forged shared similar traits with the dragon essence, which raised his hopes.

“I’ll be starting now,” Chu Feng said.

He first constructed a formation to tamper with the recovery formation so that he could tap into its power. Following that, he walked up to Long Xue and fused the golden pill he had forged into her body with the aid of the recovery formation’s energy.

But as soon as the pill fused into Long Xue’s body, a formation suddenly surfaced from within her. An identical formation appeared around Chu Feng too.

“What’s that?” Long Lin’s face darkened as soon as he saw the formation, for he sensed a hint of danger from it.

The formation was identical to the one Chu Feng had constructed on Taishi Xingzhong’s son, but it was even more potent.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Stay away!” Chu Feng suddenly roared before Long Lin could make a move. “Elder, I have tied Elder Long Xue’s life together with me.”

“What are you doing, Chu Feng?” Long Lin glared at Chu Feng with ferocious eyes.

This was the first time Chu Feng had seen such an expression on Long Lin’s face.

“You should know why I’m doing this. It’s impossible to extract the dragon essence once it’s infused into the body, but you neglected to tell me that. Elder, what’s your intention for hiding such a crucial piece of information from me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, you used me?”

Upon confirming Chu Feng’s hostility, Long Lin’s murderous aura flared.

Boom!

Dark clouds instantaneously enveloped the sky. Long Lin’s sheer murderous intent was so powerful that it induced a phenomenon. Even those outside the forbidden land shuddered in fear before his wrath.

Daoist Heavensniffer and Beast Shadow, who were sitting above the clouds, stood up at the same time.

“What a strong killing intent!” Daoist Heavensniffer exclaimed.

“Something huge must have happened,” Beast Shadow remarked.

Meanwhile, Taishi Xingzhong and the experts of the Totem Dragon Clan looked in the direction of the forbidden land. All of them realized that something huge had happened.

…

The forbidden land was completely shrouded in dark clouds.

It was not just a simple phenomenon anymore, for Long Lin had fused his martial power into it. The thunderous rumbling was filled with intense killing intent, threatening to obliterate everything in the vicinity with devastating lightning.

Yet, Chu Feng was not intimidated at all.

He was betting on whether Long Lin truly loved Long Xue or not. As long as he loved the latter, he wouldn’t dare to make a reckless move no matter how powerful he was.

“Elder, it looks like you really do love Elder Long Xue,” Chu Feng said.

Long Lin’s killing intent was seething, but he didn’t attack Chu Feng. He could have easily killed Chu Feng, but he dared not to do so, fearing that a misstep would result in Long Xue’s death.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I trusted you so much…” Long Lin spat through gritted teeth as he tried his best to suppress his urge to kill Chu Feng.

But before he could finish his words, Chu Feng interjected, “Elder, you shouldn’t say words you don’t mean. You should know better whether you trusted me or were just using me. I’ll just ask one question. Were you aware from the start that it’s impossible to extract the dragon essence once it’s infused into my body?”

“I can extract it,” Long Lin said.

“You can, but you had no intention to do so, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you’re second-guessing my intentions. I have already said that I can extract the dragon essence from your body. I believe I have already accorded you a lot of trust. Why can’t you trust me for once?” Long Lin asked.

“If you truly trust me, I want you to open that gate and allow me to meet the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others,” Chu Feng said.

Long Lin’s face immediately darkened.
