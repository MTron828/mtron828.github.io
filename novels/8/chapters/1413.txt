MGA: Chapter 1414 - A Visit From Lil Mei

While staying in the World Spiritist Alliance, Chu Feng visited Fu Feiteng’s residence to drink.

Fu Feiteng admired Chu Feng greatly, and Chu Feng also had a very good impression of Fu Feiteng. Thus, the two of them hit it off right away and drank a lot of wine together.

After that day of drinking, Fu Feiteng entered closed-door training and Chu Feng returned to his residence in the Dragon Garden. Other than the times when Sima Ying came to search for him, Chu Feng rarely went out.

However, due to the fact that Sima Ying would come to find him everyday, from her, Chu Feng came to know that a lot of things had happened in the World Spiritist Alliance.

Among the things that had happened, one of the most interesting things would be that mysterious woman called Lil Mei. Her popularity was akin to hotcakes in the World Spiritist Alliance. In fact, she was definitely the most popular person in the World Spiritist Alliance.

There was no need to mention the disciples. The amount of people who were trying to woo her were simply too many to count. Even the elders were presenting presents to her in the hopes of being able to chat with her. Even those old men who had lived for hundreds of years were trying to woo her.

Furthermore, all this was happening with Lil Mei not yet showing her appearance. All of this was happening without anyone knowing how she looked.

As for the matter that was the most ridiculous, even those geniuses who had surrounded Sima Ying all day long had now turned to wait at the doors of Lil Mei’s residence all day long. They would come to visit her residence everyday in hopes of being able to chat with her so as to obtain a favorable impression from her.

However, regardless of what sorts of identities those people might possess, regardless of what sorts of generous gifts they might be presenting to her, that Lil Mei never once opened the doors of her residence to them. It could be said that she was truly heartless toward them.

Thus, there was only a single conclusion to all of the people that had gone to pay a visit to Lil Mei; without exception, they were refused entrance.

However, even though this was the case, it did not stop the passion of her admirers. At this moment, thousands of people were waiting outside of Lil Mei’s residence. Furthermore, each and every one of them possessed high strength and status. Only a few among them had low strength and status.

That was because those without strength or status were all driven away or beaten back by those who did.

“Must it be that exaggerated?” After hearing what Sima Ying told him, Chu Feng was unable to contain his laughter.

“It’s not exaggerated at all. I passed by that Lil Mei’s residence on the way to your place today. There are a truly a lot of people gathered there, waiting for her,” Sima Ying said with an expression of seriousness. However, when she said those words, there was no trace of unhappiness to her at all. Instead, she was rather happy.

“Say, Lil Sis Ying’er, all of your admirers have been snatched away by her. Do you not feel jealous?” Chu Feng asked in a curious manner.

“Why would I be jealous? Without that annoying bunch, I’m feeling a great deal of happiness. Right now, I should be thanking that Lil Mei instead,” Sima Ying said with a beaming smile.

“Oh you girl, your heart is truly broad. However, I appreciate your character,” Chu Feng said with sincerity.

For ordinary women, even if they disliked the people who were chasing after them, if those people were to stop annoying them all of a sudden and turned to frantically woo someone else, they would not be happy at all. In fact, they would even loathe the woman who had snatched away all of their admirers.

However, Sima Ying did not do that. She instead felt secretly delighted by this. This meant that she was a very candid person and that there was not the slightest trace of fakeness to her.

If she didn’t like someone, then she didn’t like them. If she were to lose them, she would not feel grief. A girl like this was actually very rare to come by.

“Is Chu Feng here?” However, right at this moment, a woman’s voice sounded from the outside of the Dragon Garden. That voice was very pleasant-sounding and also familiar. It was Lil Mei’s voice.

“Yah? It’s that Lil Mei. Why would she be coming to find you?” Sima Ying recognized the voice to be Lil Mei’s voice. Her eyes immediately went wide open as she looked at Chu Feng in surprise.

“You’re asking me? How would I know?” Chu Feng shrugged his shoulders. He was also surprised by that Lil Mei’s visit.

“In that case, are you going to see her or not?” Sima Ying asked.

“Of course, why shouldn’t I? I have not done any shameful deeds. Why would I be afraid of meeting her?” As Chu Feng spoke, he opened the the doors to the palace hall. After he walked out from the palace hall, he soared into the sky, stood in the air and looked to the outside of the Dragon Garden. [1. Regarding the palace hall, not sure if Chu Feng’s residence is a palace in the Dragon Garden or Chu Feng is in a palace chatting with Sima Ying. I’m leaning toward the latter. However, it can’t be determined based on Bee’s writing.]

Even Chu Feng was surprised by what he saw. That was because the outside of the Dragon Garden was a magnificent sight. Other than that Lil Mei who was wearing a black cloak, there were also several thousand people outside.

All of them were men. Furthermore, many of them were holding exquisite gifts in their hands. From a single glance, Chu Feng was able to tell that they had prepared those gifts meticulously. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, other than the young disciples, there were also old men among them. It was truly as Sima Ying had said; that Lil Mei’s charm caused even the elders to be tempted.

The most important matter at this moment was that those people were all looking at Chu Feng with gazes of jealousy and hatred.

It was as if Chu Feng had snatched away their beloved.

If they could, and if they had the ability to do so, Chu Feng was certain that they would rip him to pieces while he was still alive.

However, at this time, none of them dared to do so. After all, Chu Feng’s identity as an Asura World Spiritist was known to them. Furthermore, Miao Renlong was a pillar of support behind Chu Feng. Thus, very few people in the World Spiritist Alliance dared to provoke Chu Feng.

“Miss Lil Mei is searching for me?” Chu Feng said.

“I’ve traveled all this way to find you, shouldn’t you be inviting me in to talk?” That Lil Mei spoke. Her voice was very pleasant. However, it was still altered.

Although Chu Feng did not have much of a reaction from her words, the expressions of the other men had all turned green.

What sort of situation was this? The person that they had strenuously pursued, the person who had refused to see them, that Lil Mei, actually took the initiative to come find Chu Feng, and even requested for him to let her inside.

The gap between her conduct toward them and toward Chu Feng was simply too enormous, was it not?

To be honest, practically none of the men present were able to accept this.

“That... actually, I am not the master of this place,” Chu Feng said with a smile. His unspoken implication was that it was inconvenient for him to let Lil Mei into the Dragon Garden.

“What? He’s planning to refuse?” After hearing what Chu Feng said, those people that were trying to woo Lil Mei felt as if they were being driven mad.

It was difficult for them to even give gifts to Lil Mei. Yet, Lil Mei had decided to visit Chu Feng on her own initiative. However, Chu Feng had actually decided to refuse her. How could there be anyone like him?

Right at this time, Sima Ying also walked out from the palace hall. With a beaming smile on her face, she said, “If junior sister Lil Mei has a matter that she needs to find Chu Feng for, then please come on in.”

“In that case, thank you senior sister Ying’er,” That Lil Mei accepted Sima Ying’s invitation. Her body moved slightly, and she disappeared from the sky. When she reappeared, she had already entered the Dragon Garden. Furthermore, she was walking toward the palace hall with lotus steps. [2. Lotus steps → the footsteps that beauties take]

“Rank nine Martial King.” At this moment, Chu Feng’s eyes shone. Earlier, when Lil Mei had been fighting against Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng, she had used world spirit techniques and had not revealed her cultivation. Thus, Chu Feng had not known what sort of cultivation she possessed.

However, just then, she had, intentionally or otherwise, exposed her aura in the moment she had moved. Rank nine Martial King, that was her cultivation.

“Heavens! Junior sister Lil Mei is actually a rank nine Martial King?!” At this moment, not to mention Chu Feng, everyone present displayed expressions of shock. Even Sima Ying was no exception.

After Lil Mei entered the palace hall, Sima Ying entered the palace hall following Lil Mei. However, to her surprise, Lil Mei actually stopped her. “Senior sister Ying’er, would it be possible for you to allow me to chat with Chu Feng alone?”

Hearing those words, Sima Ying was startled. A trace of awkwardness appeared on her face. However, in the end, she did not say anything, turned around and said to Chu Feng with a smile, “Your luck with women is pretty strong, eh?” After that, she left without a second thought.

After hearing what Sima Ying said before she left, Chu Feng forced a bit of laughter. Then, he turned around and took a glance at the people gathered outside of the Dragon Garden.

Those people, each and every one of them, were emitting ominous green glints in their eyes. They had expressions of wanting to kill someone. After seeing that, Chu Feng’s frame of mind became rather complicated. He did not know exactly why this Lil Mei had come to find him.

However, regardless of what it might be, Chu Feng would still have to find out. Thus, he did not say anything, descended from the sky and entered the palace hall. Furthermore, he even took this opportunity to close the doors to the palace hall.

“Miss Lil Mei, what matter might you have? There is no harm in you telling me about it,” Chu Feng said.

“Woosh.”

Right after Chu Feng’s words left his mouth, that Lil Mei suddenly waved her sleeve. Then, a frantic martial power burst forth from her and formed a golden-bright and dazzling spear. She grabbed onto the spear and thrust it explosively toward Chu Feng.
