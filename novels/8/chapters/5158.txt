Chapter 5158: Cunning Old Cat

“Wow, how impressive. What are you going to do now? Kill me?” Chu Feng asked.

“I wouldn’t go as far as to kill you. There isn’t such a deep grudge between us. But how dare you flood me with poop? That’s too much!” Old Cat cried out.

“That’s not real poop. It was manifested out of spirit power,” Chu Feng replied.

“Doesn’t make a difference,” Old Cat replied.

“What do you want to do then? Get straight to the point,” Chu Feng replied.

The truth was that he wasn’t afraid of Old Cat. The Asura King had already lent his strength to Chu Feng, buffing him up to rank four Half-God level. Naturally, he wouldn’t be afraid of the rank three Half-God level Old Cat.

He was just teasing Old Cat here.

“What do I want to do? I’d usually stuff poop down your throat, but we are acquaintances, after all. Unlike you, I won’t go that far. However, I still expect some compensation. Hand over Bai Yunqing and your Cosmos Sacks. No, you have to give me all of your treasures, including the horsetail whisk.”

Old Cat’s eyes began glowing when he mentioned the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. As expected, he had his eyes set on it.

“Fine, I’ll give them all to you. Is there anything else?” Chu Feng asked.

“The fact that we were teleported out of the ancient remnant means that you have acquired the legacy. Hand that over to me too. As long as you obediently give me everything, I’ll spare your life out of consideration of our past ties,” Old Cat replied.

“Fine, I can give them all to you. However, you have to honestly tell me whether Xue Ji is really safe or not,” Chu Feng replied.

Old Cat had previously said that Xue Ji was safe and sound, but that was when Chu Feng held it hostage. Its words lack credibility as it might have just been saying that to avoid getting hurt. Thus, Chu Feng wanted to get another confirmation from it.

Now that Old Cat believed that it had the upper hand, it didn’t have any reason to lie anymore.

“I didn’t lie to you when I said that Xue Ji was extremely talented. It’s true that I didn’t take her as my slave,” Old Cat replied.

“In other words, you lied to me about something. What is it?” Chu Feng asked with a frown.

“She’s not with me. I sold her,” Old Cat replied.

“You sold her? To who? Where?” Chu Feng asked in agitation.

He couldn’t believe that Old Cat had sold Xue Ji as if she was a commodity. It left him with an ominous premonition.

“I sold her, but who I sold her to is a secret. How can I divulge confidential customer information to you? Alright, stop dilly-dallying and hand over your stuff!” Old Cat urged.

It started walking toward Chu Feng, ready to personally strip Chu Feng of his treasures.

“You aren’t going to speak? It looks like you need to suffer a bit before you’re willing to open your motuh.”

Chu Feng’s eyes turned cold.

“Yes, it looks like you need to suffer a bit… Hold on, that’s supposed to be my line! Stop stealing my lines!” Old Cat exclaimed in a fluster.

Weng!

A spirit formation gate suddenly opened up.

Seeing that it was impossible to settle this issue with words, Chu Feng decided to release the Asura World Spirit Army to force Old Cat into revealing everything.

“Why? Are your treasures hidden in your World Spirit Space?”

Even as Chu Feng opened his spirit formation gate, Old Cat still didn’t think that anything was amiss. To put it plainly, he looked down on Chu Feng and thought that the latter wouldn’t be able to stand against him.

But that disdain only lasted till countless figures flitted out of the spirit formation gate.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Tens of millions of Asura World Spirits covered the area, tightly encircling the astounded Old Cat. Its shock only further deepened when the Asura King made his appearance.

“Holy shit! What the hell is going on? Why would so many Asura World Spirits suddenly pop out of your World Spirit Space? You brought helpers with you?”

Old Cat wondered if Chu Feng had secretly brought a helper, and the Asura World Spirits belonged to the helper and not him. After all, it was hard to believe that a rank four Half-God level world spirit would actually submit to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng simply stared coldly at Old Cat in response.

“Are they… your world spirits?”

The attitude of the Asura World Spirits clearly showed that Chu Feng was their master, but this was simply too inconceivable that Old Cat was reluctant to believe it to be real. How could a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist like Chu Feng have such powerful world spirits?

One of them had even reached rank four Half-God level!

“Cut the crap and reveal whatever my master asked you!” the Asura King bellowed.

“You actually made such a powerful world spirit submit to you?”

With all that was said and done, Old Cat had no choice but to accept the situation. His attitude immediately underwent a 180-degrees change.

“Brother Chu Feng, let’s slowly talk things through. It’s all a misunderstanding!” Old Cat meekly waved his hand, displaying a subservient attitude.

“Tell me who you have sold Xue Ji to,” Chu Feng asked.

“Calm down. I’ll tell you everything you wish to know. Xue Ji has been…”

Halfway through his words, Old Cat suddenly charged at Chu Feng. It had only feigned subservience in order to catch Chu Feng off guard. After all, the ones who was truly strong here were the Asura World Spirits and not Chu Feng.

As long as it could lay its hands on Chu Feng, those Asura World Spirits wouldn’t be able to pose a threat to him.

Shoosh!

However, just as Old Cat was about to get to Chu Feng, a figure suddenly stood in front of Chu Feng. It was the Asura King. Having remained alert all this while, he quickly rushed forward to protect Chu Feng the moment Old Cat made a move. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You’re courting death.”

The Asura King raised his palm to strike Old Cat.

Grar!

Old Cat released his spirit power in response. It was impossible for him to best the Asura King with his rank three Half-God level cultivation, but he was a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist too.

Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists were equivalent to rank four Half-God level cultivators in terms of fighting prowess, allowing Old Cat to put up a fight against the Asura King.

This was a fight beyond Chu Feng or any of the other world spirits’ level to interfere, especially now that the Asura King had taken back the strength he had previously shared with Chu Feng.

With Chu Feng’s current level of cultivation, it was hard for him to see the details of their battle. He could only feel the devastating shockwaves rippling into the surroundings.

“Hmph! A mere world spirit thinks that he’s a match for me? I’m only holding back because I don’t wish to hurt you. If you continue challenging my tolerance, I’ll put you back in place.”

While Chu Feng was unable to see the details of the battle, he was still able to hear Old Cat’s voice. Old Cat was truly an annoying fellow. Even when fighting against an expert of the Asura King’s caliber, it refused to give its mouth a rest at all.

In contrast, the Asura King wasn’t saying a word at all. He was focused on the battle.

Chu Feng started to feel a little nervous. Under normal circumstances, the Asura King should have the advantage here, considering how cultivators tended to be more powerful than world spiritists in a straightforward battle.

The problem was that he didn’t have a deep understanding of Old Cat’s means.

If Old Cat still had tricks up his sleeves, it was hard to say whom the tides of battle would favor.

“Your granny! Just you wait!”

The arrogant Old Cat let out a bellow, and the fight abruptly came to a halt. The Asura King waved his hand, and the shockwaves dissipated right away. However, Old Cat was nowhere to be seen.

The Asura King had a look of self-reproach on his face. When he saw Chu Feng looking at him, he quickly walked over and apologized, “Milord, I was useless. Please punish me for my incompetency.”

The Asura King kneeled down before Chu Feng.

Clearly, Old Cat realized that he wasn’t a match for the Asura King and fled. It was a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, after all. It was only normal for it to have many escape means.

It was only unable to escape before due to Chu Feng’s formation being buffed by the ancient remnant’s energy, leaving it helpless. But now that they were out of the ancient remnant, those restraints were no longer at play.

Naturally, Chu Feng was aware of that, but the reason he remained confident was due to the Asura King’s Heaven-defying Battle Power. He thought that the Asura King would be able to curb the Old Cat once he further raised his cultivation level.

As a matter of a fact, the Asura King did utilize his Heaven-defying Battle Power, but it wasn’t enough to keep Old Cat from escaping. That showed just how advanced Old Cat’s escaping means was.
