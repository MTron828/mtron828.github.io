Chapter 3667 - The Death God’s Edge

“I thought it was said that we could choose any weapon we wanted. How come it’s now saying that we can only choose one? This seems to be different from what we were told.” said Chu Feng.

“One weapon is enough,” after saying those words, Yin Zhuanghong stepped onto the stairs and began to walk to the second floor.

Chu Feng hurriedly followed her upon seeing that.

The second floor was still very empty. However, a blade was placed in the center of the second floor.

The blade seemed to be forged of steel, and appeared very sharp.

That sharp blade had superb workmanship. However, it would not provide any assistance to martial cultivators. That said, if it was placed in the hands of a world spirit, it would greatly increase their battle power.

“It is truly the work of a master world spiritist,” Chu Feng gasped with admiration.

Even though he was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng was still unable to forge such a weapon.

Yin Zhuanghong only took a glance at the second floor before proceeding upward.

As for Chu Feng, after gasping in admiration, he also continued upward.

As they continued upwards, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong discovered that there was a weapon on every floor of the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.

Furthermore, the further up they went, the better the weapon was.

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong decided to not bother looking at the weapons on every floor, and decided to continue climbing the stairs nonstop.

One must know that the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda had a total of eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-five floors.

When the weapon on the second floor was already of excellent quality, one could very well imagine how precious the weapon on the top floor would be.

However, after Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong reached the hundredth and first floor, they discovered that something was amiss.

The weapon on the hundredth and first floor was not only slightly better than that of the hundredth floor, but its quality was simply on a completely different level.

However, whilst the weapons from the first to the hundredth floor could be obtained at will, weapons starting from the hundredth and first floor were all guarded by spirit formations. One must breach the spirit formation in order to obtain the weapon.

“It was said that one could obtain the weapons at will, yet it turns out that we can only obtain a single weapon. Furthermore, we now need to breach a spirit formation in order to obtain a weapon. It would appear that the rumors are truly untrustworthy.” Chu Feng sighed.

“I feel that this is very reasonable. Otherwise, if someone is to come in here and decide to take away all the weapons, how exactly are the people in the future going to obtain any?”

“To obtain a weapon according to your capability, I feel that this is rather appropriate,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“I am merely sighing at this. I never said that it was inappropriate,” said Chu Feng. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Then, Yin Zhuanghong and Chu Feng continued to ascend.

Without a doubt, the further up they went, the better the weapons would become. However, the spirit formations around the weapons also grew more and more powerful.

The initial spirit formations were simply empty shells before Chu Feng. However, the spirit formations that they encountered later on were things that he would need to spend time to breach.

This was especially true for the eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-fourth floor.

The spirit formation around the weapon on that floor was extremely dangerous. It was many times more dangerous than the grand slaughtering formation outside the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.

Breaching that protective formation would most definitely not be an easy task.

One must be extremely meticulous.

That said, the weapon guarded by that spirit formation was a weapon of peak quality.

It was a sword. The sword was wholly golden, and extremely exquisite. Although it did not appear to be very imposing from its appearance, it very clearly emitted the aura of a ruler. That sword was a king amongst weapons.

For other weapons, regardless of how outstanding they were, they did not have a name.

As for that sword, it was a named weapon, the only named weapon Chu Feng had encountered so far.

That sword was called the Emperor Netherworld Sword!!!

Chu Feng had encountered many weapons that he fancied on his way there. However, once he saw that sword, all the other weapons immediately left his mind.

Chu Feng felt that if he was tasked to make a decision at that moment, he would definitely choose the Emperor Netherworld Sword.

“It would appear that you’re also tempted by it.”

Chu Feng looked towards Yin Zhuanghong. He discovered that her gaze was still fixed on the Emperor Netherworld Sword.

“As for whether or not I’ll choose this weapon, we’ll have to see the final floor first.”

After saying those words, Yin Zhuanghong began to proceed for the top floor.

Seeing that, Chu Feng followed her.

He became extremely excited.

When the Emperor Netherworld Sword was already capable of tempting him like that, what sort of quality weapon would the final weapon be?

“This...”

Finally, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong arrived at the top floor of the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.

When he entered the top floor, Chu Feng stood there, stunned. His expression and his eyes had fully revealed his current emotion -- endless excitement.

Before Chu Feng was an enormous curved blade.

The majority of the blade was black. However, the edge of the blade was a darker black.

It was strange, overbearing and incomparably sharp.

Even the Emperor Netherworld Sword on the floor below appeared much duller when compared to that curved blade.

Most importantly, that black curved blade greatly suited Her Lady Queen.

Even its name was very fitting to her.

The blade was called the Death God’s Edge.

At that moment, Chu Feng had decided that he would obtain that black curved blade.

“This is the one.”

However, right at that moment, Yin Zhuanghong’s voice was heard.

“Girl, the Emperor Netherworld Sword on the floor below is more suited for your world spirit,” said Chu Feng.

“I said that I’m taking this one. If you want it too, then you’ll have to fight me for it with your skills,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“Truth be told, it is all thanks to you that I’m able to enter this place. Logically, I should be yielding to you. Unfortunately, I am simply too fond of this weapon. Thus... I’ll do as you say and fight you for it using my skills.”

Chu Feng moved his gaze. This time, his gaze was no longer on the Death God’s Edge. Instead, it was on the protective formation around the Death God’s Edge.

Whilst other spirit formations were very complicated, that spirit formation was very simple. It was a circular spirit formation.

It looked like a spirit formation composed of water. However, it was filled with faintly visible flickers of lightning.

In short, compared to the other protective formations, that protective formation was very different.

The Death God’s Edge was located right inside it.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, a figure suddenly appeared inside the protective formation.

It was an old man. The appearance of that old man was rather fuzzy. One simply could not make out his face.

After the old man appeared, he walked out of the protective formation.

Then, he said, “This formation cannot be breached. You merely need to enter it to remove the weapon.”

“That simple?” Chu Feng asked.

“You can sense its power first,” the old man ignored Chu Feng and continued to speak. After saying those words, the old man placed his hand into the protective formation. Then, he gently flicked his finger.

“Puu~~~”

“Puu~~~”

Two fingernail-sized droplets floated out from the protective formation.

“It would appear those things are very dangerous.”

Chu Feng realized the danger of those two droplets. After all, they were the power that filled the protective formation.

However, after he finished voicing his warning, he extended his arm and grabbed one of the droplets.
