Chapter 2544 - Immortal Sea Fish Clan

[1. Xianhai → Immortal Sea.]

Seeing those two people, Xianhai Shuoyi stood up and asked, “What sort of treasure did the two of you manage to obtain?”

“Here, Big Brother Shuoyi, this is what I’ve obtained.”

“This is mine.”

The man and woman both revealed an item in their hands.

The woman was holding a bamboo slip. The color of the bamboo slip was different from the one that Young Master Li Ming gave Chu Feng. However, the mysterious characters engraved onto it were exactly the same.

As for the man, he had a stone in his hand. That stone was completely pitch-black in color. However, it was emitting a glistening luster. It was not light. Rather, it was luster.

That stone was only the size of an ordinary brick. At a glance, it appeared very unremarkable. However, it just so happened to give off an extremely extraordinary feeling. It was as if the stone was alive, and possessed a very precious lineage.

“Bamboo Slips with martial comprehension are only useful to Martial Ancestors. However, they can fetch some cash. Thus, there’s no loss in obtaining it.”

“As for this Immortal Armament Blackiron Stone, it could fetch a very good price,” Xianhai Shuoyi evaluated the two items. Then, he arrived beside the man and patted his shoulder, “You’ve made a profit this time around.”

“Big Brother Shuoyi, then what did you manage to obtain after entering the Sacred Heavenly Temple this time around?” The woman asked curiously.

“I...” Xianhai Shuoyi revealed an embarrassed expression.

“Xianhai Shuoyi, I’ve heard you saying that you’ve failed earlier?” Seeing Xianhai Shuoyi’s hesitant expression, the man asked, “You couldn’t possibly really be that unlucky to encounter an expert that had chosen the same treasure as you in the Sacred Heavenly Temple, and then be defeated by that person, right?”

As for the woman, she stopped her previously taunting mannerisms and stared at Xianhai Shuoyi with wide-opened eyes.

The two of them were both waiting for Xianhai Shuoyi to give them an answer.

“Mn.”

After hesitating for a moment, Xianhai Shuoyi nodded.

“You were actually unlucky enough to encounter something like that?” The man and woman both revealed extremely surprised expressions.

However, at that moment, the two of them no longer expressed any ridiculing mannerisms, and were more or less feeling sorry for Xianhai Shuoyi.

It would appear that their relationships were pretty decent. Their taunting and ridiculing mannerisms earlier were merely meant to joke around with Xianhai Shuoyi. They did not really expect that Xianhai Shouyi would encounter such an unlucky thing.

After all, the possibility of something like that happening was extremely slim.

After finding out that Xianhai Shuoyi had encountered that sort of unfortunate thing, and was even defeated by his opponent, the man and woman who knew Xianhai Shuoyi’s personality well started to feel sorry for him.

“It was merely an accident. That fellow was extremely weak. In terms of cultivation, he was simply no match for me.”

“Unfortunately, cultivation is useless in the Sacred Heavenly Temple. As for the test put forth by that guardian spirit, it just so happened to be in something that I am not very proficient in. That is why I ended up being defeated.”

“Else, even ten thousand of him would not be a match for me,” Xianhai Shuoyi declared.

“Exactly what sort of test did that guardian spirit give?” That woman asked curiously.

“It’s hard to explain. In any case, it was not a conventional match,” Xianhai Shuoyi said.

Xianhai Shuoyi would naturally not say that he had been defeated by Chu Feng in a match of spirit power. After all, a match of spirit power was a very common practice. If he were to declare that he had lost in a match of spirit power, he would most definitely be laughed at by others.

“Exactly what is happening here today? I’ve heard that Her Highness Yu’er also encountered a competitor in the Sacred Heavenly Temple,” The man said. [2. The Yu in Yu’er means ‘fish.’ ‘er is just a suffix to make a name sound cutesy/familiar. Hint hint Eastern Sea Region]

“Yu’er also encountered a competitor?” Hearing those words, Xianhai Shuoyi immediately grew tense.

“That’s right. Her Highness Yu’er declared it herself,” That man nodded.

“How is Yu’er?” Xianhai Shuoyi asked nervously.

From his reaction, it seemed that he was deeply concerned for that Her Highness Yu’er.

“Who is Her Highness Yu’er? She is the number one genius to appear in our Immortal Sea Fish Clan in the last several tens of thousands of years.”

“Naturally, she won,” The man said proudly.

“It’s great that she won. Yu’er is truly amazing,” Hearing those words, Xianhai Shuoyi felt relieved.

“Actually, when we first heard about it, we were also extremely worried for Her Highness.”

“After all, what Her Highness used was the Martial Immortal-level Sacred Temple Bead. We all know that apart from the True Immortal-level Sacred Temple Beads that anyone can use, the other Sacred Temple Beads possess cultivation requirements.”

“Thus, we felt that Her Highness Yu’er must’ve encountered a Martial Immortal-level expert.”

“Her Highness Yu’er has only just become a Martial Immortal, thus we were afraid that she would end up suffering a mishap after encountering such a powerful opponent.”

“But, Her Highness Yu’er managed to defeat her opponent and successfully obtained the treasure,” That woman said with a proud expression.

Xianhai Shuoyi stood up and said, “Where’s Yu’er? I’m going to see her.”

“I heard that Her Highness Yu’er is still on the isle in the center of the lake,” The woman pointed into the distance.

“I’ll go see Yu’er. You two wait for me here,” Xianhai Shuoyi said. Then, he soared into the sky and began flying toward the direction that woman indicated.

After Xianhai Shuoyi left, the man and woman both revealed envious expressions on their faces.

“I am truly envious of Big Brother Shuoyi. He is actually able to be this close to Her Highness Yu’er. People like us do not even have a chance to approach Her Highness Yu’er,” The woman said as she looked to the direction Xianhai Shuoyi had left toward.

“When even a girl like you is feeling envious, you can very well imagine how enormously envious I, a man, am,” The man sighed.

“Haha, big brother, you were just unlucky. After all, Big Brother Shuoyi grew up together with Her Highness Yu’er,” The woman said.

“That’s true. Although Xianhai Shuoyi’s mother is only Her Highness Yu’er’s servant, it was thanks to her that Xianhai Shuoyi was able to get in contact with Her Highness Yu’er. To us people of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, this should be the greatest fortune, no?” The man sighed with deep emotions.

In the center of the seven-colored immortal lake was an enormous island.

At that moment, Xianhai Shuoyi was rapidly approaching that island.

“Stop!”

Suddenly, a shout was heard. Then, a middle-aged man appeared in the empty space.

That middle-aged man was wearing cyan armor. His armor seemed to be made of fish scales, and was glistening under the sunshine.

That armor was the work of uncanny craftsmanship. It was even like art. That armor itself was a treasure.

As for that middle-aged man’s aura, it was extremely deep and powerful. Even Xianhai Shuoyi, a True Immortal, felt extremely small before that man.

Not to mention attacking him, merely a spit or even a glance from that middle-aged man would be sufficient to instantly obliterate him. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

On the waist of the middle-aged man were two title plates. One was the same as the one that Xianhai Shuoyi had on his waist, the title plate with the characters ‘Xianhai’ on it.

As for the other, it possessed two other characters, ‘Palace Guard.’ [3. Palace Guard → Dianwei.]

“Immortal Sea Fish Clansman Xianhai Shouyi pays his respects to Lord Palace Guard!!!”

Upon seeing this individual, Xianhai Shuoyi immediately clasped his fist and bowed respectfully to that man.

“And here I was wondering who it was. So it’s you, Shouyi. There’s no need to stand on ceremony, you can stand back up,” The middle-aged man said with a smile.

“You must have come to find Her Highness Yu’er, right?” The middle-aged man asked with a smile on his face. Judging from his appearance, he was quite familiar with Xianhai Shuoyi.

“Yes, Lord Palace Guard. Is Her Highness Yu’er present?” Xianhai Shuoyi asked.

“Her Highness Yu’er is on the island. Go on ahead,” The middle-aged man said.

“Thank you Lord Palace Guard,” As Xianhai Shuoyi expressed his thanks, his body shifted and his clothes fluttered in the wind. He had proceeded to continue flying toward the island.

“Humph.”

Right after Xianhai Shuoyi left, the smile on that middle-aged man’s face immediately disappeared. It was replaced with an expression of contempt.
