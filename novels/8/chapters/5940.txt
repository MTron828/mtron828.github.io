Chapter 5941: Milady Queen Shall Stand Up For You

Fresh blood spilled as they traded blows. It belonged to Immortal Slaughter’s Number Four!

Despite the restrictions imposed on Chu Feng, and Immortal Slaughter’s Number Four having reached rank two True God level, he wasn’t a match for Chu Feng. He was at a disadvantage after trading several blows.

“Third Brother, save me!” Number Four had no choice but to ask the masked old man for help.

“Chu Feng, I have already offered to reconcile, but you refused to accept, Since that’s the case, you can die now,” Number Three said before unleashing his oppressive might.

He was a rank three True God level cultivator!

Sensing that the tides weren’t in his favor, Chu Feng tried to escape via Divine Flitting, but the restrictions imposed on him by the Netherworld Embryo’s energy were too great. He could only travel at a speed comparable to a rank four True God level cultivator.

That should have been enough to shake a rank three True God level cultivator off, but Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Three could raise his cultivation too. Seeing that Chu Feng was going to get away, he quickly raised his cultivation to rank four True God level.

“Why are you escaping, Chu Feng? Don’t you want to avenge your grandmother? I’m standing in front of you right now. Your grandmother was a prodigy, but she died tragically in our hands. Shouldn’t you kill us and avenge her?

“I guess the renowned Chu Feng is a mere coward, after all. Aren’t you embarrassed at being called the strongest junior in the world of cultivation? You aren’t qualified at all!”

Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Three grabbed Number Four and pursued Chu Feng together. The two of them hurled insults while giving chase.

It was surprising how Number Three had an even more vicious tongue than Number Four despite his mask.

“Be rational, Chu Feng. There’s no need to pit your life against them. They are small fries in your path. You can take care of them whenever you want once you raise your cultivation,” Divine Deer spoke up.

She was aware of Chu Feng’s means.

If Chu Feng took off the talisman on his head right now and used his bloodline powers instead, he could raise his cultivation to rank two True God level. If he unleashed the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes in that state, he might just be able to kill a rank four True God level cultivator.

However, the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes was an incomplete skill. The red lightning beast had told him not to use it if possible, or else his life would be in danger.

The Divine Deer didn’t want Chu Feng to risk his life on such small fries.

“Rest assured, elder. I won’t be provoked by them. I’ll surely kill them, but I won’t risk my life over them. They aren’t worthy,” Chu Feng replied.

In truth, he was conflicted. He wasn’t so weak-minded as to be shaken up by words, but he was hesitant to leave just like that. The Immortal Slaughterer’s seven brothers were cunning, evident from how they had chosen to throw the lot in with the Netherworld Sect.

He did not doubt that he would become strong enough to kill these people with ease soon, but he feared that he wouldn’t be able to find them then.

“Why are you running, Chu Feng? This Queen will stand up for you.”

“Eggy?”

Chu Feng was startled, but he quickly broke out into a beaming smile. He hurriedly looked into his World Spirit Space, and there, he saw a perfectly healthy Eggy standing before him.

“Eggy, you’re fine? How did you recover?”

Chu Feng was overjoyed. He had been worried out of his mind for her ever since she fell unconscious. He tried many ways to awaken her, but none of them worked, and that made him feel incredibly helpless.

“What are you saying? I have always been fine, you fool. Didn’t I tell you that I’ll be able to assimilate those things? Did you doubt me?” Eggy asked.

“But...”

Chu Feng still remembered how Eggy looked before she fell unconscious. It felt like she was passing on to the other world. Eggy might be fine now, but she had panicked then.

“No buts. I am at rank one True God level now. Hurry up and let me out. I’ll teach those two bastards a lesson on your behalf!” Eggy waved her little fists.

“Eggy, the enemy is at rank four True God level. Are you sure you’ll be fine?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, have you forgotten how strong I am? How can a mere rank four True God level cultivator possibly be my match?” Eggy scoffed.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll be counting on you to deal with them.”

With a nod, Chu Feng opened his World Spirit Space.

It didn’t take long for Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Three and Number Four to catch up.

“You aren’t fleeing anymore? Why? Are you hoping to make reconciliations? Chu Feng, we could have made peace if you had only killed Number Seven, but now that you have taken the lives of Number Five and Number Six too, there’s no way to turn back anymore.

“You pushed your luck too far. I shall avenge Number Five and Number Six today. I won’t show you any mercy even if you are indeed a Netherworld Sectmember!”

Shoosh!

A surge of black gaseous flames gushed out from the spirit formation gate and pierced through the chests of Immortal Slaughter’s Number Three and Number Four. Then, it raised the two old men up in the sky.

“You two old things, who are you trying to kill?” Eggy strutted out of the spirit formation gate.

Her cultivation was still at rank one True God level, but she had heaven-defying battle power of three cultivation ranks. That meant that her true fighting prowess was comparable to a rank four True God level cultivator.

But even normal rank four True God level cultivators wouldn’t be a match against her.

Before Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Three and Number Four could react, spikes suddenly emerged from Eggy’s black gaseous flames and furiously messed up their insides.

“Gah!” Number Three and Number Four wailed in agony.

There were times when Chu Feng thought that his ways of torturing others paled in comparison to Eggy.

Eggy turned to Chu Feng and pointed her finger at him. A surge of black gaseous flame rushed out and manifested into a black sword before him. Her intent was clear—she wanted Chu Feng to personally take the lives of these two beasts.

Chu Feng took the black sword, marched up to the two old things, and stabbed their dantians.

The two old men cried in misery as their protective formations emerged. There were two black holes above their protective formations, and Chu Feng could sense a gaze assessing him and Eggy from within.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
