Chapter 4212 - Incomplete Map Of The Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain

Compared to the protective formation of the white-haired man, the protective formation that Yuan Shu had set up was much more detailed.

It too was semi-transparent. But, it was extremely magnificent, and had taken the form of a palace.

On each of the four cardinal directions around the palace sat an impressive and impervious black tortoise.

The aura emitted by the protective formation was simply impregnable.

“Weewooh~, quite gaudy.”

Confronted with Yuan Shu’s protective formation, the white-haired man laughed with contempt.

Then, he began setting up his spirit formation. Soon, a long golden sword appeared before him.

The sword was only over a meter long.

Although the sword appeared very exquisite, its might simply couldn’t be compared to the slaughtering formation that Yuan Shu had set up earlier.

Furthermore, the white-haired old man had finished his spirit formation much faster than Yuan Shu had.

In a match of world spirit techniques, the time needed to set up a spirit formation was determined ahead of time.

As long as one did not surpass the predetermined time, one could take as long as one wanted to set up their spirit formation.

Thus, for the sake of perfection, world spiritists would generally use all the time they were allocated to set up their spirit formations.

However, the white-haired man did not do that.

He had chosen to finish his spirit formation ahead of time.

Such behavior, was him simply not placing Yuan Shu in his eyes at all.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh---”

Suddenly, the white-haired man unleashed his attack.

Once he unleashed his attack, it was revealed that the golden sword that he held in his hand was not as simple as it appeared.

The golden sword began to transform. In the blink of an eye, it had turned into over ten thousand golden swords.

Over ten thousand golden swords flew in the sky, completely covering it up. Like a rain of swords they shot toward Yuan Shu.

The rain of swords was extremely powerful. In merely the blink of an eye, Yuan Shu seemed to be on the verge of defeat.

“How could this be? Why would it be this powerful?”

Shock filled Yuan Shu’s eyes. He had clearly comprehended rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.

Even if his mastery over his Dragon Transformation Sensation was not as proficient as that white-haired man’s, the gap shouldn’t be so enormous, no?

“Crack---”

“Crack---”

Before Yuan Shu could think much, cracks began to appear on his protective formation.

“Brother Li, it’s my loss.”

Yuan Shu knew that he wouldn’t be able to win, and a continued struggle would be meaningless. Thus, he spoke to concede.

However, after hearing Yuan Shu’s acknowledgement of defeat, the white-haired man laughed coldly. Not only did he not stop, he had even strengthened his attack.

Soon, Yuan Shu’s protective formation was completely breached.

The rain of golden swords had breached Yuan Shu’s defenses, and were still moving to attack him.

“Clamor---”

But, before the rain of golden swords could reach Yuan Shu, they all shattered.

The white-haired man’s slaughtering formation had been destroyed!

Seeing that, the white-haired man revealed a look of displeasure.

“Yuan Shu, we clearly agreed to a spirit formation contest without any martial power. What is the meaning of this?” the white-haired man asked with a stern voice.

“It’s this old man who used martial power,” suddenly, a voice sounded. Then, a figure landed beside Yuan Shu.

That person was none other than Yuan Shu’s master, Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Master, you’ve returned.”

Yuan Shu was surprised to see Grandmaster Tang Chen. He had an ashamed look on his face.

The reason for that was because he knew who his opponent was.

The black-haired old man was known as the Revered Master Beast Tamer.

Not only was he a peak Utmost Exalted-level expert, he was also a renowned world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy.

As for the white-haired man, his name was Li Fengxue. He was that Revered Master Beast Tamer’s personal disciple.

The Revered Master Beast Tamer was an old acquaintance of Grandmaster Tang Chen.

As for Li Fengxue, his age was similar to Yuan Shu’s.

Yuan Shu’s defeat in their confrontation was not only a disgrace to himself, it was also a disgrace to his master, Grandmaster Tang Chen.

It just so happened that his master was someone who cared a lot about face.

Because of that, Yuan Shu was afraid.

Knowing that he had let his master down, Yuan Shu was afraid that he would be punished.

“Yuan Shu, are you alright?”

To Yuan Shu’s surprise, Grandmaster Tang Chen, who had always cared a lot about face and was extremely strict with him, did not blame him and was instead extremely concerned about his well-being.

“Master, this disciple is fine,” replied Yuan Shu.

“It’s good that you’re fine.” Grandmaster Tang Chen nodded his head. Then, he looked to the Revered Master Beast Tamer.

“Beast Tamer, is your disciple deaf or what?”

“Did he not hear Yuan Shu concede?” Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke with a very unpleasant tone.

“Tang Chen, why shield your disciple like this?”

“My disciple knew what was going on. He definitely wouldn’t injure your beloved disciple.”

After saying that, Revered Master Beast Tamer looked to Li Fengxue, “Am I right, Fengxue?”

“What master said is extremely correct. This disciple would naturally not harm brother Yuan Shu. This disciple planned to stop after breaching brother Yuan Shu’s protective formation.”

“Senior Tang Chen has misunderstood this disciple’s intentions.”

Before Li Fengxue replied to his master, he actually bowed respectfully to him. It seemed like he paid great attention to etiquette.

But earlier, he had clearly addressed Yuan Shu by name without adding ‘brother.’ It was only after Grandmaster Tang Chen appeared that he changed his tone.

From this, it could be seen that Li Fengxue was a true hypocrite.

“Truly, like master, like disciple,” Grandmaster Tang Chen sneered. Not only did he disapprove of Li Fengxue’s words, he also mocked both Li Fengxue and his master.

“Of course. My disciple has surpassed your disciple. That seems to have also illustrated the disparity between you and I,” Revered Master Beast Tamer said with a proud smile.

Hearing those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen’s expression turned ugly.

There had been some unpleasantries between him and the Revered Master Beast Tamer to begin with.

Thus, Yuan Shu’s defeat had truly embarrassed him.

“Milord, young hero Asura is seeking an audience.”

Right at that moment, the voice of a Seven Suns Mountain Range’s elder sounded from outside.

“Asura?”

Yuan Shu looked to Grandmaster Tang Chen upon hearing the name.

He naturally knew that Asura was Chu Feng.

But, Chu Feng had been there several times before. Yet, on all those occasions, Grandmaster Tang Chen had been unwilling to show his face, unwilling to meet him.

It was the reason why Yuan Shu looked to Grandmaster Tang Chen.

It would be up to his master as to whether or not to grant Chu Feng an audience.

“What bullshit young hero?”

“Tell him to scram. A weakling is not qualified to meet us.”

However, before Grandmaster Tang Chen could even say anything, that Reverend Master Beast Tamer spoke.

“Beast Tamer, this is my disciple’s territory. It is my disciple who gets to decide who can come and go from this place.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After saying those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen turned to Yuan Shu, “Go ahead and let him in.”

“Master, are you serious?” Yuan Shu was hesitant.

He knew that his master didn’t want Chu Feng to come in.

The reason why he wanted Chu Feng to come in now was purely because he was acting out against the Revered Master Beast Tamer.

“Let him in,” Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke with a tone of certainty.

“This disciple understands,” as Yuan Shu spoke, he walked out of the spirit formation they were in.

After some time passed, he returned.

Chu Feng also followed Yuan Shu inside.

“Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to Grandmaster Tang Chen.”

Chu Feng had learned from Yuan Shu that Grandmaster Tang Chen was present.

Out of respect, he removed his disguise and used his true identity to greet Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Wasn’t it some Asura? Why did a Chu Feng come in instead?”

“Brother Yuan Shu, are your friends all this deliberately mystifying?” Li Fengxue spoke to Yuan Shu mockingly. He had guessed that Asura was most likely Chu Feng’s pseudonym.

That said, he did not even bother to take a glance at Chu Feng.

It was as if he was not qualified to enter his eyes.

Chu Feng took a glance at Li Fengxue and Revered Master Beast Tamer. He didn’t say anything, not even bothering to greet them respectfully.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had roughly learned what had happened from Yuan Shu.

Although he knew that Revered Master Beast Tamer and Li Fengxue had quite the grand origin, Chu Feng could tell that they had not come with good intentions.

As such, there was no need for him to be polite toward them.

Like his disciple, the Revered Master Beast Tamer did not bother paying any attention to Chu Feng. He behaved as if Chu Feng was invisible as he turned to look at Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Tang Chen, do you still remember our agreement?”

“The outcome of the sparring between our disciples has been determined.”

“According to our agreement back then, since you’ve lost, you will have to put forth that Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain,” said Revered Master Beast Tamer.

“Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain?” Hearing those words, Yuan Shu’s expression immediately changed.

He knew very well what the Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain represented.

It was a very important item to his master.

Wasn’t the spar between him and Li Fengxue a simple spar?

Why would such a precious item be used as the gambling stake?

It couldn’t possibly be real, right?
