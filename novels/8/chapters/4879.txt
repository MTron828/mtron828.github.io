Chapter 4879: Entitled

By this point, the Holy Valley had already confirmed that the Holy Lotus Tree had blossomed due to Chu Feng. In other words, it was impossible to enter it without Chu Feng.

This was also the reason why Shengguang Baimei, despite his hostility toward Chu Feng, chose to bring out his treasured Heavenly Court Holy Fruit to quickly heal him.

However, Shengguang Buyu didn’t speak of the full truth. He chose not to tell Chu Feng that they needed him to enter the Holy Lotus Tree. Instead, he told him that a cultivation realm in the Holy Valley had opened, but there was a special requirement for this cultivation realm.

Every time it opened, a non-Holy Valley junior had to accompany them in.

Usually, the Holy Valley would invite juniors out there to join them in this cultivation realm, but since Chu Feng was already here, they decided to have him accompany them instead.

This was Shengguang Baimei’s directive.

Shengguang Baimei didn’t want Chu Feng to know that the Holy Lotus Tree was in full bloom due to him. He was afraid that it would sully the Holy Valley’s reputation if this were to get out.

The mission for Chu Feng was clear-cut. They wanted Chu Feng to enter the cultivation realm together with the other talents of the Holy Valley.

Of course, they wouldn’t put someone as dangerous as Chu Feng alone with their juniors just like that. It would be sending helpless lambs into a lion’s den.

So, they decided to strike a treasure into Chu Feng’s soul to seal off his cultivation. Shengguang Baimei chose to do it himself out of fear that Shengguang Buyu would go easy on Chu Feng.

At this very moment, Shengguang Baimei had already pressed his palm on Chu Feng’s chest, causing the latter’s face to warp in pain. His chest began emanating a bizarre purple light.

Shengguang Baimei should have been happy at being able to pull Chu Feng down from his high horses, but instead, there was a deep furrow on his forehead. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The other members of the Holy Valley were frowning as well. They looked at Chu Feng with astonished looks and started discussing amongst themselves.

The purple light was the treasure sealing off Chu Feng’s cultivation, and it should have sealed Chu Feng’s cultivation all the way down to Exalted level. Yet, his cultivation halted at rank nine Utmost Exalted level, unable to be sealed any further.

This didn’t make sense.

However, it did show just how powerful Chu Feng’s soul was, highlighting how different he was from the others.

“Lord Baimei, time is of essence. This should suffice,” Shengguang Buyu said.

He feared that Shengguang Baimei would harm Chu Feng at this rate. Just Chu Feng’s warped face was enough to tell what kind of a state he was in.

“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Shengguang Baimei snapped at Shengguang Buyu.

Despite his sharp tongue, he stopped trying to further seal off Chu Feng’s cultivation.

“Would rank nine Utmost Exalted level be enough? It looks like there are Martial Exalted level cutlivators amongst the juniors of the Holy Valley,” Chu Feng remarked.

Chu Feng could tell that Shengguang Baimei would have sealed his cultivation further down if it was possible, but the truth was that he had been secretly resisting the treasure’s power earlier. Due to that, Shengguang Baimei was only able to seal his cultivation down to rank nine Utmost Exalted level.

“What business is it whether we have Martial Exalted level cultivators or not? Are you intending to do something? Chu Feng, this is an opportunity for you to make up for your misdeeds. Make sure to cherish it well!”

Shengguang Baimei glared at Chu Feng sharply.

Chu Feng chuckled softly, deciding not to further provoke Shengguang Baimei.

Following that, Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu brought Chu Feng over to the Holy Lotus Tree, which was still in full bloom at the moment.

The crowd that had gathered here earlier had been asked to leave, and those who remained were the ones who were qualified to enter the Holy Lotus Tree to cultivate.

All in all, there were 99 of them.

There were only 100 slots for the cultivation realm in the Holy Lotus Tree in total. If too many people entered, the Holy Lotus Tree wouldn’t release its energy for the juniors to cultivate.

Throwing Chu Feng into the mix, there were a total of a hundred of them.

Given that Chu Feng had arrived under the accompaniment of Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu, as well as the fact that he was an outsider, it was inevitable that he would catch the attention of most of those present.

As for Chu Feng, his attention was swiftly drawn to four individuals, two men and two women.

These four individuals didn’t conceal their cultivation, so Chu Feng could tell that they were all at Martial Exalted level. Shengguang Buyu introduced them to him shortly after.

The tall man with a slightly darker skin tone was Shengguang Chuyao. He was a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator, and he appeared to be an amiable person. He was one of the few who clasped his fist and greeted Chu Feng after learning of his identity.

The other man with fair complexion and a dashing face was Shengguang Haoxuan. He was at rank two Martial Exalted level too. Unlike the amiable Shengguang Chuyao, he carried a cold and haughty attitude toward Chu Feng. His chin was tilted so high up that Chu Feng could nearly see into his nostrils.

The third person was a woman named Shengguang Menglai. Her snowy-white skin had a jade-like texture that looked as if it was glowing under the sun. Her long legs were eye-catching, and her chest area also boasted a beautiful curve. In terms of her figure, there would be few in the world who would be a match for her.

She was a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator.

Last but not least was a woman named Shengguang Xintian. She had fair skin and a beautiful appearance too, but her dress-up was much less conservative compared to Shengguang Menglai, fully showing off her beautiful legs.

Putting aside Chu Feng, even the juniors of the Holy Valley couldn’t help but sneak glances toward Shengguang Xintian.

It was worth noting that Shengguang Xintian had a sweet appearance that contrasted to Shengguang Menglai’s cold demeanor, making her a more comfortable presence. It was just that her chest wasn’t as large as Shengguang Menglai’s, though to be fair, it was because the latter’s was simply too big.

“Hey, brat, what are you gawking at?” a dissatisfied voice sounded.

It was from Shengguang Xintian.

She had noticed Chu Feng’s gaze alternating between her and Shengguang Menglai, and the intent behind it infuriated her.

“Cough... My apologies, it’s just a man’s natural instincts.”

Chu Feng scratched his head awkwardly.

“A man’s natural instincts? You sure dare to speak. Take another look and I’ll dig your eyeballs out!”

Another menacing voice sounded.

It was from Shengguang Haoxuan.

He wasn’t just trying to scare Chu Feng here. His vicious eyes clearly showed that he thought Chu Feng’s presence to be an eyesore.

However, Chu Feng merely sneered in response to Shengguang Haoxuan’s threat.

“This brother over here, I must say that you’re being unreasonable here. I saw your eyes lingering on the two ladies earlier too. Are you trying to say that you’re the only one entitled to look at them?” Chu Feng mocked.
