Chapter 5862: The Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s Warning

The Ancestral Martial Galaxy and the Nine Souls Galaxy were located in the Eastern Region. There was no barrier between them, but there was a clear separation of their territories. This line was drawn by the powerhouses from the early years of the present era, dividing the Eastern Region into two halves.

While the Nine Souls Galaxy was also formidable in the early years of the present era, it was not on par with the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. There was only an equal split of territory between them because the Nine Souls Galaxy had fought alongside the Ancestral Martial Galaxy then.

However, the friendship between the two galaxies faded with time. Very few cultivators from the two galaxies were able to freely travel in space too, so no one bothered to remember where the exact boundaries were anymore.

However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist knew where the boundary was, and he was quickly making his way toward it.

The boundary was visible—there was an extremely faint gradient difference in the darkness, though it would be nigh impossible to see it unless one was specifically looking out for it.

The line produced by the gradient difference stretched for a long distance across space, dividing the Eastern Region into two sections.

Instead of crossing into the Nine Souls Galaxy’s territory, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist stood at the border and stared straight ahead. “Stop acting. I see you. Come out.”

There was a spatial distortion at the other side of the boundary, and a person appeared. It was a middle-aged man carrying an ax, Song Changsheng.

“I’m surprised. I didn’t expect you to be Puppeteer Exalted,” Song Changsheng said.

He had been watching the situation all this while. Given the proximity and his means, he was able to see everything that had happened.

“Cut the crap. Did you really intend to watch by the sidelines?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

He knew Song Changsheng had been watching the situation all this while, but the latter showed no intention of making a move despite not knowing he was Puppeteer Exalted then.

“I’ve declared that I’d never step into the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,” Song Changsheng said.

“Do you think he’ll blame you for going against your promise when you’re saving his son?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“Your first day knowing me? I... don’t like being nosey,” Song Changsheng said.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was rendered speechless. He was aware of Song Changsheng’s personality. He heaved a sigh and said, “Things are different now. That disciple of yours is fond of mine. She’ll hate you if she knows you turned a blind eye to her lover’s plight.”

Song Changsheng was unfazed by it. He even replied with a rare sarcastic tone, “If my disciple is going to hate anyone, it’ll be you. You even schemed against your disciple to acquire the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasures.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist chuckled. “It’s not your first day knowing me too.”

“True. You’re an unscrupulous man.” Song Changsheng glanced at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist in annoyance. “I’m curious to know what you’d do if you and your disciple’s stances differ one day.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What are you saying? Why would my disciple take a different stance from mine?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist retorted.

“Chu Feng is different from you. He’s not unscrupulous in the pursuit of power. He might be weak now, but it’s only a matter of time before he catches up to you. Once that happens, there might be some conflict of interest between the two of you,” Song Changsheng said.

“Don’t be curious about that. No one knows what’ll happen in the future. Song Changsheng, I’ll ask you a question. Do you see me as a friend?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“Somewhat,” Song Changsheng replied.

“Good. Actually, I came here to bid you farewell. I’m leaving,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Where to?”

“You’re asking the obvious. Of course I’m heading to the Ninth Galaxy.”

“You’re leaving just like that? What about your disciple? He’s made an enemy out of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

“Rest assured. That disciple of mine will be fine even if you die.”

“You’re that confident in your disciple?”

“What does this have to do with confidence?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

Realization dawned on Song Changsheng, and he narrowed his eyes. “That commotion that day really was...”

“Why are you so curious about my disciple?”

“I’m a cultivator. Isn’t it normal for me to be curious about someone of Chu Feng’s talents? Besides, there’s a connection between us.”

“And you still refused to help him?”

“Just because there’s a connection doesn’t mean I have to help him.”

“Fine, fine. Continue being your powerful hermit. When do you intend to go in? You should know we’re restricted here. We have to enter the Ninth Galaxy to continue progressing,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“I’ll enter when the time is ripe,” Song Changsheng replied.

“How long will it take?”

“I’m not sure.”

“It’s not that I’m underestimating you, but it’s God’s Era. Be careful.”

“You’re talking about the Ancient Era’s clans?”

“The Ancient Era’s clans are not to be made light of, but in my view, the one whom you need to be the most careful about is my disciple’s maternal grandfather.”

“Jie Tianran?” Song Changsheng was surprised.

“Don’t look down on him. He’s deeper than you think. Of course, he doesn’t pose a threat to you right now, but I can’t say the same in the future. Don’t let your guard down.”

“I told you I won’t get involved in your disciple’s business. I won’t participate in the conflict between the Ancient Era and the present era too.”

“That’s why I’m telling you to be careful. Trouble can come knocking even if you take a passive stance,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“I’ll be careful. You’re bidding me farewell, but what about the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city? You’re going to leave it be after putting so much effort into manifesting it?” Song Changsheng asked.

“I’ll treat it as my parting gift to my disciple,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

Song Changsheng harrumphed. He didn’t think the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was so generous. The latter was probably unable to do anything about the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, so he chose to relinquish it to his disciple.

“It looks like our predecessors in the early years of the present era have reached quite a formidable level,” Song Chang remarked.

He knew how powerful the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was, yet the latter was unable to do anything about the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city. This showed the disparity in power between them.

“They were lucky to be born in an era of abundance. Once I’m in the Immemorial Domain of Gods, heh...” The Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s eyes gleamed expectantly. “All right, I’ll be going now.”

“You aren’t going to meet your disciple?” Song Changsheng asked.

“That fellow’s too talented. He reinforced the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s protective formation so much that even I’m unable to slip in. Besides, I’ve already bid him farewell. There’s no need to do so a second time. We’ll reunite in the Ninth Galaxy,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

With a wave of his hand, he disappeared in space.
