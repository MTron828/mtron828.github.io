Chapter 5719: What Do I Have to Fear? It’s Not As If I Don’t Have Any Trump Cards

“Elder Qilin, that external energy has something to do with the remains of the ancestral dragon, right?” Chu Feng asked the Heaven-devouring Qilin.

“You’re not dumb, Little Feng. I wanted to see the remains of the ancestral dragon to verify whether it is really dead or not. From the looks of it, I’d say that there’s still a breath left in that ancestral dragon. Of course, there’s another possibility,” the Heaven-devouring Qilin said.

“Another possibility?”

“Long Lin mentioned that their first clan chief came to prominence with the help of the ancestral dragon, but he stopped his descendants from approaching the ancestral dragon. It’s possible that a secret skill has been used on the ancestral dragon, possibly by the first clan chief or the ancestral dragon itself, to prevent others from using or taking away its remains.

“The forbidden land we’re in is still a safe zone because you’re still in proximity to the ancestral dragon, but the effects will be more pronounced if you travel further away. There’s no way to take the dragon essence away. You’ll be in danger the moment you leave the safe zone.”

At this point, the Heaven-devouring Qilin reverted to its real body, walked up to Chu Feng, and said, “Why don’t I try assimilating the dragon essence? If it works, it’d mean that the secret skill was planted by their first clan chief. That’d make things easier to deal with. Otherwise… you’ll be in trouble as it’d mean that the ancestral dragon is the one behind this. I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it in my current state.”

“You just want to assimilate the dragon essence,” Chu Feng pointed out.

“Don’t say that. I’m trying to figure out the truth for you. Don’t worry, I’ll just take in a little bit of it. Long Lin won’t notice a thing,” the Heaven-devouring Qilin said.

Chu Feng hesitated, but he eventually decided to give it a try. “Fine, just a little.”

Chu Feng tried his best to push the dragon essence out of his soul as much as he could, though he was unable to fully push the dragon essence out.

Meanwhile, a golden light shrouded the Heaven-devouring Qilin, as a mysterious power gathered in its mouth. It was hard to describe this power. It didn’t feel particularly powerful, but it was a unique power that was not to be underestimated.

This power was much more formidable than the one the Heaven-devouring Qilin used to devour the saint beast.

The Heaven-devouring Qilin channeled the power into Chu Feng’s body in an attempt to assimilate the dragon essence, but it was to no avail. In the end, it was forced to withdraw the power. By then, it was gasping for air, and sweat was flowing profusely from its forehead.

It had to pay a heavy price for its earlier means.

“It’s not working. It really is the ancestral dragon’s means. I can’t do anything about it for the time being. Little Feng, I can only wish all the best for you.”

The Heaven-devouring Qilin shook its pig head as it looked at Chu Feng in sympathy before it turned back into an imprint on his robe.

This made Chu Feng realize that the situation was trickier than he had expected. It would mean that the dragon essence couldn’t be extracted under normal circumstances… though there was a way that was bound to work, and that was for Chu Feng’s soul to be dissipated.

To put it bluntly, the dragon essence could be extracted once Chu Feng was dead.

Long Lin had to be aware of this, which meant that he was planning to kill him from the start. That could also be the reason he refused to allow him to meet Long Chengyu and the others, as they would have known about the remains of the ancestral dragon and the dragon essence.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

For the next few days, Chu Feng spent all his time cooped up in his palace, unless Long Lin came to visit. He claimed to be cultivating, but in truth, he was examining the dragon essence in hopes that he could figure out a way to overcome the ancestral dragon’s secret skill and safely extract the dragon essence.

One day, he discovered something.

“Elder, I think I might have found a possible solution,” Chu Feng told the Heaven-devouring Qilin.

“Oh? What is it?” The Heaven-devouring Qilin’s interest was piqued.

“It’s possible to destroy the secret skill,” Chu Feng said.

“Is that all you figured out?” The Heaven-devouring Qilin was rendered speechless.

“Is that not enough?” Chu Feng asked.

“As if I don’t know that! There’s no secret skill in the world of cultivation that wouldn’t crumble before absolute might, but this is a secret skill left behind by that ancestral dragon. Even I can’t do anything about it. The ancestral dragon might have been dying when it placed this secret skill on itself, but even a starving camel is bigger than a horse, let alone a god beast and a true dragon! Where can you find the power to destroy its secret skill?” the Heaven-devouring Qilin scoffed.

“I am aware that the secret skill is formidable, but I also noticed that there are several flaws in it, possibly due to its power withering over time. It might be possible for a pinnacle True God level cultivator to breach it with sheer force,” Chu Feng said.

“No one can beat the descendants of the Dragon Clan in terms of physical might. I get it. You’re thinking that Long Lin might be able to help you destroy the secret skill?” the Heaven-devouring Qilin asked.

“I don’t know, but I don’t think that Long Lin planned to dispel the secret skill for me in the first place. Otherwise, he would have told me about the binding force,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re right on the mark, Little Feng. He’s definitely up to no good if he has chosen to hide the truth from you. You have been duped by him right from the start. But again, that was to be expected. You might be a bright one, but how can you outplay those wily old foxes? But even if he didn’t lie to you, he has the power to coerce you, and you won’t be able to do anything about it. Your fate is already in his hands. All you can do is pray that he’ll be benevolent enough to spare you on the account of your past ties,” the Heaven-devouring Qilin said.

“What else can the dragon essence be used for other than to treat illnesses and as a cultivation resource?” Chu Feng asked.

“Be it for treating illnesses or as a cultivation resource, the effects of the dragon essence are more pronounced on the descendants of the Dragon Clan. I’d say that Long Lin is just using you as fodder. I don’t think he ever intended to spare your friends or you. The truth is cruel, but that’s how it is,” the Heaven-devouring Qilin said.

“In other words, I’m doomed?” Chu Feng asked.

“What do you think? Why else has he been lying to you? Who knows? That story about that sickly old grandma might be a lie too. He might just be the one who landed her in that state! You’re trapped here anyway, so there’s no way you could figure out the truth. Little Feng, you really got done this time around,” the Heaven-devouring Qilin said.

“I don’t think so,” Chu Feng replied without the slightest hint of fear.

It was not as if he didn’t have any aces up his sleeves.
