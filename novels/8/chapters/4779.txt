Chapter 4779: Remorse

“Song Xi, are you really innocent? Why didn’t you say so earlier?” the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall exclaimed.

He had previously questioned Song Xi on the matter, but the latter just wouldn’t say anything.

“But Li Jiaojiao’s cultivation is beneath yours. How could she possibly force you into a relationship with her?” the chief elder asked.

Song Xi didn’t respond right away. He seemed to harbor some reservations about revealing the truth, but his indignance made him bawl even harder.

“Song Xi, tell me what happened. I’ll redress your grievances,” Chu Feng said.

Upon hearing those words, Song Xi raised his head and saw Chu Feng’s steely and infuriated eyes. Feeling a boost of courage, he decided to reveal the truth.

“Nangong Yuliu was present too.”

“Nangong Yuliu? It’s actually him?!”

Chu Feng felt a surge of fury rising up his chest. It was just a moment ago that he warned Nangong Yuliu not to cross him, but the latter actually did such a thing!

Now that he thought about it, Nangong Yuliu had directed him with such gleeful eyes, but he thought that the other party was just provoking him. It turned out that he had already made a move on Song Xi!

“Chu Feng, there’s no way to redress my grievances anymore. No one other than you will believe me. With Nangong Yuliu’s influence, there’s no way I’ll be able to escape from his clutches.

“However, you must avenge me. You must make sure to do so! I... I’m no longer a man anymore. You must return the favor to him, or else I won’t be able to die in peace!”

Song Xi cried even more pitifully as he used his martial power to take off his pants.

Both Chu Feng and the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall were stunned by what they were seeing. Song Xi’s manhood was actually severed!

“How could this be? Men, men! The cell of thorns should only involve whipping, so how could Song Xi be humiliated in such a manner?” the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall bellowed.

However, Song Xi shook his head and said, “It’s not them. It’s Nangong Yuliu. He came by earlier.”

“What are you crying out for?”

The elders of the Law Enforcement Hall heard the chief elder’s bellows and came over.

“You came at a good time. How do you do your job? How could you allow an outsider to inflict harm on your prisoners?” the chief elder questioned furiously.

However, the chief elders of the Law Enforcement Hall simply sneered coldly and said, “Oh? I’m afraid that we aren’t aware of that matter. Besides, you should be going for the person who harmed the prisoner, not us. What’s the point of complaining to us? You’re the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall, so don’t you at least have the power to bring justice for your own disciples?”

“If you know that I’m the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall, how dare you speak to me in such a manner?” the chief elder bellowed.

“Woah, what airs from the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall! I can tell candidly that you were allowed in here not because of your identity but that our hall master has ordered us to allow Chu Feng to enter the premises. You’re nothing more than an extra here,” an elder of the Law Enforcement Hall said.

“You!!!”

The chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall gritted his teeth furiously. He didn’t dare to make a move on these elders not because he was afraid of them but he was worried about crossing the Law Enforcement Hall.

“Chief elder, let’s go,” Chu Feng said as he began taking his leave.

The chief elder quickly walked out too.

“Chu Feng, we have no evidence for this matter, so we won’t be able to go after Nangong Yuliu for this,” the chief elder said.

“I understand. The sectmaster has just sentenced me into the Hidden Dragon Prison, and her decision reflects the will of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. It’s clear that I, Chu Feng, am a person detested by the sectmaster and the entire Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

“On the other hand, Nangong Yuliu is a personal disciple whose grandmother is the great Nangong Chunyue, a Hidden Dragon Elder. He’s a person blessed from birth.

“Don’t worry, chief elder. I know my current position very well,” Chu Feng said with a bitter smile.

It looked as if he had come to a difficult compromise here.

After saying those words, he headed back to his residence under the escort of the chief elder. The chief elder could feel Chu Feng’s rage and helplessness, and he cursed his own powerlessness once more.

As the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall, he should have been the one to stand up for Chu Feng and Song Xi, but he was unable to do so. He possessed neither the capability nor the courage for that.

...

Nightfall, in a grand palace in the East Dragon Hall, Nangong Yuliu was accompanied by many courtesans as they drank and made merry. These courtesans were dressed skimpily, but Nangong Yuliu wasn’t any better either.

It was an utter sight of debauchery.

All of a sudden, the doors opened and a woman ran in. This woman had a seductive face and a voluptuous figure.

Nangong Yuliu would have surely threw a tantrum if anyone were to barge in while he was having fun, but when he noticed that it was this woman, he shot a glance at the courtesans around, and the courtesans quickly took their leave.

He rose to his feet and walked toward the woman.

“Jiaojiao, what brings you here?”

It turned out that the woman was no other than Li Jiaojiao, one of the culprits who landed Song Xi in his current state.

“Senior Nangong, I’m afraid. I heard that Chu Feng is still alive, and he wields the power of the Hellking from the Vicious Beast Hellworld,” Li Jiaojiao cried.

“Jiaojiao, how could you believe such rumors? It’s nothing more than an act of bravado from Chu Feng. There’s no need to pay any heed!” Nangong Yuliu replied with a disdainful smirk.

“But I heard that Chu Feng is a brazen man. If he finds out that it was Senior Nangong and I who have harmed Song Xi, he surely wouldn’t let us off!” Li Jiaojiao exclaimed worriedly.

“Jiaojiao, you’re my woman. You need not fear. No one will dare to bully you as long as you remain under my protection!” Nangong Yuliu said.

“B-but I’m still afraid. I won’t be a match for Chu Feng with my weak cultivation,” Li Jiaojiao cried. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Don’t worry, Chu Feng doesn’t have long to live either,” Nangong Yuliu said.

“I-is that true, Senior Nangong?” Li Jiaojiao asked.

“When have I ever lied to you? I can tell you directly that other than Zuoqiu Youyu and Zuoqiu Yanliang, there’s no disciple in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect whom I fear! Even Li Muzhi will soon be done in by me!” Nangong Yuliu said.

“You’re incredible, Senior Nangong,” Li Jiaojiao said.

“Of course! Shouldn’t you know better than anyone else as someone who has tasted my prowess? Heh, looks like you must have forgotten all about it. It’s time to jog your memory then!”

Nangong Yuliu took off his clothes in a flash before reaching forth to pull Li Jiaojiao into his embrace.

“Don’t move.”

However, Li Jiaojiao suddenly retreated. She flicked her wrist, and an orb appeared on her palm. This orb had a mirrorlike surface, reflecting Nangong Yuliu and the licentious look on his face.

Even Nangong Yuliu couldn’t bear looking at the current him that he immediately put his clothes back on. Perplexed, he asked, “Jiaojiao, what are you doing?”

“Jiaojiao? I’m afraid you might have gotten the wrong person here.”

Li Jiaojiao first stowed away the orb in her hand before taking out her Cosmos Sack. She reached her hand into it and pulled out a massive figure that landed right beside Nangong Yuliu.

It was a woman who had bloodied lacerations all over her body, seemingly having been struck again and again by a thorn whip. Despite her disfigurement, Nangong Yuliu was still able to identify her as Li Jiaojiao.

“Senior Nangong, save me.”

The real Li Jiaojiao moaned feebly as she began weeping pitifully.

Nangong Yuliu immediately turned his eyes toward the other ‘Li Jiaojiao’ and he questioned coldly, “You aren’t Li Jiaojiao. Who are you?”

“Nangong Yuliu, I warned you not to provoke me, or else I’ll make you pay dearly for it.”

The face of the fake ‘Li Jiaojiao’ grew increasingly cold as her appearance and clothes began to morph into someone who Nangong Yuliu was more than familiar with.

“Chu Feng, it’s you?!?!”
