Chapter 5923: Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s Sikong Changsheng

“I do.” Chu Feng nodded.

“You practice Heaven’s Eyes,” the old voice pointed out.

“Where did you hear that from?” Chu Feng was surprised.

“I need not hear it from anywhere. You deciphered our Dragon Breath Spring Chamber’s True Dragon Chessboard. Only someone who possesses Heaven's Eyes can do so.”

“Elder, are you from the Dragon Breath Clan?”

“I am.”

“Elder, why are you trapped here?”

The Dragon Breath Spring Chamber was managed by the Dragon Breath Clan, and the Dragon Breath Clan were the descendants of true dragons.

However, Chu Feng heard a while back that the Dragon Breath Clan was taken away by a humongous red hand that covered the sky. Since then, all Dragon Breath Spring Chambers and Dragon Breath Clansmen had vanished from the face of the world.

“That’s not convenient for me to say,” the old voice replied.

“Elder, I’m being hunted by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but I revealed myself to you. What could be inconvenient for you to say?” Chu Feng replied.

“This... I’m afraid I really can’t say.”

“I heard that all of the Dragon Breath Clansmen were taken away by a humongous red hand. Is that true?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The hell! Are there no secrets in the world of cultivation? How did you know that?”

“Someone saw it.”

“I’m afraid it really isn’t convenient for me to speak. Why don’t you wait here for a moment first? I’ll go ask about it.” The entity inside the barrier left for a moment.

“Big brother Chu Feng, what business does the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber have with you?” Zi Ling asked.

“I don’t know, but it could be related to them escaping from this place. He pointed out that I possess Heaven’s Eyes, so I presume that my Heaven’s Eyes might be of great use here,” Chu Feng deduced.

“What’s with Tan Yu’s dantian?” Zi Ling asked.

Chu Feng lifted the jar containing Tan Yu’s dantian. He could see its content even through the jar. “This dantian is unique. It looks more like it was constructed than hereditary, similar to a manmade bloodline”

“Manmade bloodline?” Zi Ling was surprised.

“Yes, it’s an incredible skill surpassing the means of a True Dragon World Spiritist. It’s far beyond what I’m capable of,” Chu Feng said.

“Could the Tan Clan’s secret be hiding inside this dantian?”

“I can’t tell. The secret might lie with the dantian, but it could also lie with Tan Yu too. It is also possible that it’s not related to them at all, and this is just a coincidence. Regardless, since we have decided to get involved in this, we might as well help Tan Yu to the end,” Chu Feng said as he released the isolation formation around Tan Yu.

“Lord Chu Feng, are you done speaking with that elder?” Tan Yu asked.

“That elder had something up, so he’ll be right back. Since we have some spare time, I’ll help you regain your cultivation first,” Chu Feng said as he began constructing a formation.

Chu Feng placed the dantian back into Tan Yu’s body. A powerful aura immediately gushed out, knocking Tan Yu out. Chu Feng also closed his eyes.

“Big brother Chu Feng!” Zi Ling worriedly called out, fearing that something was amiss with the dantian.

However, she soon realized that the two of them were safe and sound; they had only lost their consciousness.

“Could it be...” Zi Ling thought of a possibility, so she quietly sat by the side and watched the situation.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng’s consciousness had delved into a peculiar space covered in white fog that looked reminiscent of clouds. This space was created by powerful spirit power far beyond his current means.

He looked around the space. Other than its size being comparable with a larger Upper Realm, he couldn’t discern anything else at all.

“You have potential.”

A white-robed old man appeared. He gave off an air of ethereality, reminiscent of an immortal. He was two meters tall, and his hair was white like snow. He held a glistening white jade cane in his hand.

Even though his face was covered in wrinkles, his eyes glowed with energy and clarity.

“Junior Chu Feng pays respect to elder.” Chu Feng bowed.

“I know you’re Chu Feng,” the white-robed old man replied.

Chu Feng was startled. “Elder... you aren’t a formation?”

“Of course not. I wouldn’t have been able to converse with you if I was a formation.”

“Elder, are you from the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect?”

He was surprised, as the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect had existed a long time ago, so he thought that everyone there had already died. Even if there were remnants of them left behind, they were probably their descendants.

However, Chu Feng’s instincts told him that this person had existed at the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s peak.

“Mm. I am Sikong Changsheng. Those in the present era shouldn’t have heard about me.”

“Junior Chu Feng pays respect to Elder Sikong.”

“You have already paid respect to me. Why are you doing it a second time?”

“My earlier gesture was indeed out of respect, but I thought you were a formation. Now that I know you aren’t just a formation but an elder from the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect, I couldn’t help but pay respects once more out of admiration.”

“You are a polite one, but bootlicking will get you nowhere with me. I’m not in your world, so I can’t interfere in your affairs. Even if I can, I won’t help you since I do have some ties with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” the white-robed old man replied with a smile.

“I know, and I don’t expect anything either. I am both a world spiritist and a native of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. When I learned that the strongest power during the inception of the present era wasn’t the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion but our Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s Ancestral Martial Realm Sect, I felt both proud and honored,” Chu Feng explained.

“I see. That’s understandable. One’s homeland is always special.” Sikong Changsheng nodded.

After some pleasantries, Chu Feng dove straight into the heart of the matter, “Elder, is the awakening of Tan Yu’s bloodline a trial?”

He knew that this old monster who had lived through the ages wouldn’t help another person for no reason. Just a few words of flattery wouldn’t be enough to win the other party’s recognition.

He would have to prove himself if he wanted to earn Sikong Changsheng’s recognition.
