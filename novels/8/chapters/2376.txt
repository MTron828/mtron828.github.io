Chapter 2376 - Special Magic

“You!!!”

At that moment, not to mention Ma Yue, even Tian Yi was stunned.

After all, the two of them did not know that Zhou Zongzhi had become a rank four Half Martial Ancestor.

As for that Zhou Zongzhi, both his abilities and battle power were not inferior to Ma Yue. He was able to contend against Ma Yue when they were at the same level of cultivation. And now, his cultivation had increased by a level. Naturally, Ma Yue would not be a match for him.

“What’s wrong? Is it that shocking? You two must not have thought that I would reach a breakthrough in cultivation so quickly, right?” Zhou Zongzhi said with a beaming smile.

“Could it be the rewards from the guardian clan?” Ma Yue asked.

The reason for that was because she remembered that the guardian clan’s supervisors had been gambling with one another on who the victor between her and Zhou Zongzhi would be.

The victor of the two would be able to obtain a reward from the guardian clan. As for that reward, it was extremely beneficial to Divine Bodies. Regardless of whether it might be Ma Yue or Zhou Zongzhi who obtained it, they would both be able to reach a breakthrough in cultivation with it.

Other than that reward, Ma Yue was unable to think of any other possibility that would allow Zhou Zongzhi to reach a breakthrough to rank four Half Martial Ancestor so quickly.

“You’ve guessed correctly,” Zhou Zongzhi said with a beaming smile. He was immensely pleased with himself.

“But... you should only have been able to obtain that reward ten days from now. How did you manage to reach a breakthrough already?” Ma Yue asked. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If you were the victor, you would have naturally had to wait ten days to obtain the reward. After all, you’re trash from the Elm Lower Realm. Regardless of your cultivation, you will remain trash in the elders’ eyes.”

“But, who am I? I am a genius from the Splendor Night Lower Realm. Since I’ve won, why would I need to wait for ten long days?” When mentioning the matter, Zhou Zongzhi revealed an even more pleased expression.

“The guardian clan is truly lacking in fairness. They are not qualified to guard this Hundred Refinements Stage established by the Chu Heavenly Clan!!!” At that moment, Ma Yue was so furious that she started to snarl angrily.

Her voice was so resounding that it caused heaven and earth to tremble.

A single emotion filled her voice: disappointment.

“You’re correct. This place is indeed unfair. It’s so unfair that even if I were to kill you, no one would punish me.”

“The two of you are of lowly birth. Your lives are lowly and insignificant. If I want to kill you, I will be able to do so as I wish,” After Zhou Zongzhi finished saying those words, his body moved, and he began to fly toward Ma Yue.

The frightening power that came crashing toward their faces caused Ma Yue and Tian Yi to feel the aura of death.

The two of them knew that they were no match for Zhou Zongzhi. Thus, they did not bother with any pointless resistance. Instead, they held one another’s hands and closed their eyes. They had made their preparations to die.

Merely, the two of them possessed unreconciled expressions on their faces.

“I fear that I’ll have to disappoint you all.”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng appeared before Ma Yue and Tian Yi like a phantom.

“Who are you?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, Zhou Zongzhi’s expression also changed enormously. He was immensely shocked.

“Scram!!!” Chu Feng merely spoke one word, and a burst of boundless martial power swept out from his mouth.

Although Chu Feng’s martial power was invisible, it was something that Zhou Zongzhi was unable to withstand.

“Bang!!!” With merely his voice, Chu Feng knocked Zhou Zongzhi flying, causing him to crash ruthlessly onto the altar.

“This!!!”

At that moment, not to mention Zhou Zongzhi himself, even his lackeys had turned pale with fright.

They did not know who Chu Feng was. However, they were able to imagine how powerful Chu Feng was from Zhou Zongzhi’s current state.

Although the altar was completely undamaged after Zhou Zongzhi collided with it, Zhou Zongzhi was seriously injured.

Not only was his body badly mutilated from the collision, he had also suffered extremely serious internal injuries. He tried to climb up many times, but still tumbled to the ground.

Zhou Zongzhi had lost even the strength to crawl back up. From this, it could be seen how serious his injuries were.

“Senior, you?!”

What suddenly occurred had surprised both Ma Yue and Tian Yi too. They did not expect that Chu Feng, someone that they’d only just met, would actually be willing to help them.

“What? Senior?!!!”

Seeing Ma Yue and Tian Yi addressing Chu Feng as senior, the crowd was extremely frightened.

The reason for that was because the simple address of ‘senior’ had signified to the crowd the relationship Chu Feng had with Ma Yue and Tian Yi.

This person who was able to seriously injure Zhou Zongzhi with merely a single word was the backing of Ma Yue and Tian Yi.

“You... exactly who are you?”

“Could it be that you’re from the Elm Lower Realm?”

At that moment, Zhou Zongzhi started to panic. After all, he had been so excessive toward Ma Yue and Tian Yi.

Right now, if it were truly someone from the Elm Lower Realm that had come here, they would likely not let him off so easily.

Chu Feng looked to his surroundings, then smiled indifferently.

He said, “All of you, listen carefully. I am not from the Elm Lower Realm. Instead, I am from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.”

“It’s actually the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm?!!”

Chu Feng’s words came like a lightning strike to the crowd.

After all, the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm was the legendary place of trash. How could such a powerful person appear from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm?

That said, even though they were feeling extremely astonished, they still firmly believed Chu Feng’s words. After all, there was no reason for someone to declare themselves to be from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. After all, being from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm did not bring any prestige.

Seeing the astonished expressions of the crowd, the corners of Chu Feng’s mouth rose into a smile.

What he wanted was precisely for those people to have a whole new level of respect for the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. And now, he had accomplished his goal.

“It’s useless,” Right at that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze to a person beside Zhou Zongzhi.

“W-what did you say?”

“W-why do I not understand you?” Being stared at by Chu Feng’s sharp gaze, that person immediately started to shiver in fear, and started to stutter.

“What I’m saying is that the help signal you sent off earlier is simply useless. I have already sealed this place with a spirit formation. All of you can forget about help coming,” Chu Feng said in a deemphasizing manner.

Hearing those words, the fellow that sent out the signal for help immediately fell powerlessly onto his butt. Then, he crawled back up with great effort and began to kowtow to Chu Feng.

He begged, “Milord, please spare me, please spare me!!!”

He was truly frightened.

In fact, it was not only him who was frightened by Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s omniscient attitude as if everything was within his grasp had frightened all of the people present.

An expert, an actual expert was standing before them.

Before him they could not make any petty moves, because those petty moves would definitely be discovered by him.

However, Chu Feng completely ignored the crowd, and began to walk toward the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone one step at a time.

The Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone seemed to contain a special sort of power. Chu Feng was unable to describe it. In short... the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was calling to Chu Feng.

“Exactly what sort of magic power do you possess? It would appear that I will have to experience it personally,” As Chu Feng spoke, he gently extended his hands toward the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. He was planning to remove it.

“You’ve come for the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone?” Right at that moment, Zhou Zongzhi’s incomparably astonished voice sounded.

“What, you have a complaint?” Chu Feng turned his cold gaze toward Zhou Zongzhi.

“No, I wouldn’t dare.”

“How could this junior have a complaint regarding senior? Merely, this junior wanted to call to senior’s attention to the fact that no one has been able to remove the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. Senior... you must definitely prepare yourself for failure.”

No one expected that the incomparably arrogant Zhou Zongzhi would start to flatter Chu Feng and wear an appearance of being petty and low.

That said, the crowd had no idea that Zhou Zongzhi was thinking about something completely different from what he was saying, ‘Regardless of how powerful you might be, you will still not be able remove the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. I’ll watch as you humiliate yourself here.’

Chu Feng did not bother with Zhou Zongzhi again. Instead, he directly moved his right hand toward the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.

.......

The next moment, the entire region turned silent. It was so quiet that the only sounds that one could hear were intense heartbeats.

Everyone was stunned. This was especially true for that Zhou Zongzhi who was waiting for a show. He was completely dumbstruck.

Even Ma Yue and Tian Yi couldn’t believe their eyes, and were rubbing them nonstop.

The reason for that was because the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone that no one was able to move had been removed from the altar.

It was now being held in Chu Feng’s right hand.
