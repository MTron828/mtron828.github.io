Chapter 5239: Let the Hunt Begin

“Haven’t you heard? A duel just happened outside the Qian Clan Tavern. An old man from the Holy Light Galaxy challenged Tang Xiu to a duel. The old man was not too bad, being a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator, but how could he possibly be a match for Tang Xiu if that’s all he has? He ended up in defeat and severed his own meridians,” that man said.

“Where are they now?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know. Probably still at the Qian Clan Tavern?” that man replied.

Chu Feng quickly rose into the air and headed for the Qian Clan Tavern. He was certain that the old man was Shengguang Daokui.

When he arrived at the Qian Clan Tavern, he saw a lot of people discussing the matter, but Shengguang Daokui and Tang Xiu were nowhere to be seen. He had to ask around before understanding what had happened.

It turned out that Tang Xiu had learned that Shengguang Daokui was from the Holy Light Galaxy and intentionally insulted it, leading to Shengguang Daokui issuing a challenge to Tang Xiu. Tang Xiu accepted the challenge, but he imposed a rule where the person who was defeated had to sever their own meridians.

The duel ended in Shengguang Daokui’s defeat.

It didn’t really matter whether a cultivator severed their own meridians or not. As long as their soul and dantian remained intact, their cultivation wouldn’t be impaired. To be frank, Tang Xiu simply wanted to humiliate Shengguang Daokui, but there wasn’t much damage done here.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng was still worried for Shengguang Daokui. It was just that he was unable to find the latter.

The only thing he could do for Shengguang Daokui was to deal with Tang Xiu on his behalf and return the humiliation. He couldn’t allow his elder to be insulted just like that. It was just that he couldn’t issue a challenge to Tang Xiu yet since he had to deal with the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan first.

Chu Feng continued looking for Shengguang Daokui and Tang Xiu, but he was unable to find either of them.

He didn’t know that Tang Xiu was actually resting in the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s warship together with the strongest elder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, Situ Tingye.

“Young master Tang, is Lord Zhuang Qing still in closed-door training?” Situ Tingye asked as he poured a cup of tea for Tang Xiu.

“Yes, my master has been in closed-door training for a long time now. Elder Tingye, are you disappointed that my master isn’t here?” Tang Xiu asked.

“Of course not. It’s already an honor for our Situ World Spiritist Clan that young master Tang is willing to watch our junior hunting competition. I heard that young master Tang defeated a cultivator for the Holy Light Clan with a single move just a while ago?” Situ Tingye asked.

“It wasn’t one move but three moves. I underestimated that old man. However, as long as I wished so, he wouldn’t even be able to withstand a single strike of mine,” Tang Xiu replied.

“Of course. Who doesn’t know that young master Tang Xiu is the number one cultivator beneath Half-God level in our Totem Galaxy?” Situ Tingye replied.

“I dare not claim that title. Putting aside that old monster, Ouyang Canjian, who refuses to raise his cultivation in preparation for that battle, there are at least three people who are superior to me beneath Half-God level. However, when it comes to the Holy Light Galaxy…”

Tang Xiu laughed disdainfully.

It was not as if he had never looked up to others before, but never a person from the Holy Light Clan.

“Young master Tang, why do you view the Holy Light Galaxy with such enmity? It’s just a fallen galaxy. I heard that the strongest expert there is only at early Martial Exalted level,” Situ Tingye said.

“Early Martial Exalted level is their strongest expert? Then why would I encounter a peak Martial Exalted level cultivator today? Furthermore, based on what he had said, there seem to be even stronger experts in his Holy Valley,” Tang Xiu said.

“I guess it’s possible for the Holy Light Galaxy to have hidden powerhouses too. It’s not as if anyone would bother keeping a close eye on a fallen galaxy. Still, I believe that our Situ World Spiritist Clan would be able to destroy a place like the Holy Light Galaxy with ease. If young master Tang truly doesn’t like the Holy Light Galaxy, why don’t I send some people down to massacre them?” Situ Tingye asked.

“I appreciate your goodwill, Elder Tingye. First and foremost, I don’t have such a deep grudge with the Holy Light Galaxy. Secondly, do you know the Holy Light Galaxy well enough to be boasting that you’re able to destroy it with ease?” Tang Xiu asked.

“Are there people in the Holy Light Galaxy whom our Situ World Spiritist Clan is unable to deal with?”

Situ Tingye suddenly felt a little unnerved.

It was not too long ago that he had dispatched a party with God-cloak World Spiritist Situ Duanyu and one of their most talented juniors, Situ Gouyue, down to the Nine Souls Galaxy. Such a line-up should have been enough to dominate the entire Eastern Region.

Yet, all of their life talismans shattered not too long ago.

It made him realize that there was a gap in knowledge about the Eastern Region.

“You may look down on the Holy Light Galaxy, but it would be foolish to underestimate them too much. They aren’t as weak as you think them to be,” Tang Xiu said.

He had refrained from revealing the true reason he viewed the Holy Light Clan with such enmity. In truth, his master had once lost to a person from the Holy Light Galaxy… and that person severely injured him with just a single strike.

If not for that person showing mercy, his master would have been dead by now.

The only thing that person mentioned was that he was from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, so they knew nothing else about him other than that.

Tang Xiu held his master in high regard, so he couldn’t accept his master being defeated by someone from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. He made up his mind to exact vengeance for his master by defeating that person and crushing everyone from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

“Elder Tingye, there’s a favor I’d like to ask of you,” Tang Xiu suddenly said.

“What is it, young master Tang?” Situ Tingye asked.

“I am training my spirit power along with my martial cultivation, and I have managed to reach rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation. I heard that it’s possible for outsiders to enter the spirit beast hunting ground with the permission of the Situ World Spiritist Clan,” Tang Xiu said.

He wanted to enter the spirit beast mountain range to hunt the spirit beasts too.

“Young master Tang Xiu, I’m afraid that’s no longer possible. We don’t have any guest token left,” Situ Tingye replied.

“Is that so?” Tang Xiu replied with narrowed eyes. He didn’t believe those words, but he went along with it anyway. “It’s fine. I’m here to join in the commotion anyway.”

…

Soon, it was finally time for the junior hunting competition to begin.

Many powers had gathered on the Spirit Beast Upper Realm to see how the competition would unfold. Among the juniors from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, there were three people on whom the crowd mainly focused their attention.

Those three were the most talented juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, having reached rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation at a young age. They were the most outstanding juniors the Situ World Spiritist Clan had since its founding.

Of them, the one whom everyone had the highest expectations for was none other than Situ Jingchuan. He was the oldest amongst the three, being at 98 years old, but he was also the junior who had achieved the amazing feat of hunting a spirit beast containing a secret formation fifty years ago.

He had grown much stronger over the last fifty years, so the crowd believed that he might just accomplish something incredible this time around.

“Everyone, welcome to our Situ World Spiritist Clan’s once-every-fifty-years junior hunting competition. Today, we have with us an esteemed guest, the personal disciple of Lord Zhuang Qing, young master Tang Xiu.”

Following Situ Tingye’s introduction, Tang Xiu appeared on the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s floating warship.

Standing among the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, Chu Feng narrowed his eyes. He had been searching for Tang Xiu to no avail over the last few days, but who could have thought that the latter was actually riding on the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s warship?

He was currently hiding amongst the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

What Chu Feng didn’t know was that there was another pair of eyes looking at Tang Xiu from the crowd—Shengguang Daokui.

Shengguang Daokui was safe and sound. He had disguised himself just as Chu Feng had advised him to, changing his appearance and keeping his Holy Valley token.

“Just like me, many of those present here have witnessed our once-every-fifty-years junior hunting competition many times. However, I promise you that this junior hunting competition will be a momentous event in the long history of our Situ World Spiritist Clan.”

Situ Tingye’s speech pushed the mood to a new high, inciting loud cheers. Everyone was looking forward to seeing how the junior hunting competition would unfold. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I hereby announce the commencement of the junior hunting competition!”

Situ Tingye activated the formation in his hands, and the sealed gates leading into the spirit beast mountain range slowly opened.

Boom!

All of a sudden, another formation activated in front of the newly-opened gates. There was a burst of blinding light, followed by a row of large words.

“Juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan who dares to enter the spirit beast mountain range will pay with their lives!”

The crowd was stunned to see those words. The juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan also began chattering among themselves.

Chu Feng smiled at that sight.

This was the formation he had secretly planted beforehand. This formation was purely a visual one with no other effects, but it was able to stir huge ripples under such a setting.

Boom!

A massive palm fell down on the row of large words and dissipated them. It was Situ Tingye’s doing.

“Playing such tricks on our Situ World Spiritist Clan; do you think that our juniors will be intimidated by this? Tell me, juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, is any one of you afraid?”

Situ Tingye stood at the forefront of the warship as he addressed the juniors below him.

“We aren’t afraid!” the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan replied resoundingly.

Situ Tingye nodded in satisfaction.

Chu Feng wasn’t surprised by this development either. He didn’t think that the Situ World Spiritist Clan would be intimidated by something of this level either.

Nevertheless, he still planted the formation there to make them regret their actions. They might be without fear now, but they would soon regret disregarding his warning.

“Let the hunt begin!” Situ Tingye announced.

The juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan excitedly drew their weapons and charged into the spirit beast mountain range. Chu Feng did the same as well.

“Indeed. Let the hunt begin,” he sneered.
