Chapter 5861: Failure to Enter

In distant space far away from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy was an immense, hidden formation. It was filled with people from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, including Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist Jie Tianran, who was also the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

They were far from the Eastern Region, but they could see the ongoing battle in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy through the formation. However, all of the elders, regardless of their levels and standing, had turned their eyes to Jie Tianran.

None of them could see anything anymore. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

They had seen the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders assault the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, Chu Feng’s appearance in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, the showdown between Chu Feng and the Ancient Era’s top prodigies, and even the appearance of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect.

They saw the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster confronting the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders with a terrifying power, only for the power to crumble due to her lacking cultivation. Following that, a woman in a white dress wielding power comparable to the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders appeared.

From their clash, they could tell the seven of them had reached Heavenly God level.

Just then, a vast fog settled in and covered the entire Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Despite having specially prepared this formation to observe the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, they were still unable to see through the fog.

Or at least that was the case for the elders.

The elders turned to Jie Tianran, wondering if he could still see what was going on with his superior spirit power.

“This is no ordinary fog. I saw it once in an immemorial fog. It’s produced by an immemorial treasure. Someone has intentionally released it, knowing that we are observing the situation from afar. They must be trying to hide something,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said as he retracted his gaze.

The elders understood that even Jie Tianran was unable to see what was happening at the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

“Lord Mansion Master,” an elder timidly spoke up.

“What’s wrong? Speak,” Jie Tianran asked.

The elder took out a bunch of life tokens. All of them had shattered. “Just a while ago, all of the people whom we have sent into the Ancestral Martial Galaxy have been killed.”

“Did they get exposed?” an elder guessed.

The people whom they dispatched were disguised as wandering cultivators; they didn’t go in their capacity as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s world spiritists.

“No matter the reason, I have to personally make a trip to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,” Jie Tianran said.

The elders weren’t surprised to hear that. They had no intention to get involved in this matter at the start. They had only dispatched their men over to gather intelligence on the Ancient Era’s clans.

But now that the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect had appeared, there was no way they could stay out of this anymore. That was a true treasure trove, especially to world spiritists like them.

...

As Jie Tianran prepared himself to head toward the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was done dealing with the Ancient Era’s clans. He was now standing before the massive gates of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city.

Even though the main city had fully manifested, its gates remained shut. While the city appeared to be open from the top, there was an extremely violent formation protecting it from intruders. The only way to enter it was through its gates.

Knowing that the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect was not to be made light of, even the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had refrained from making a reckless move. He carefully examined the massive city that spanned the size of a realm before him.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Moments later, he swiftly formed hand seals while backing off, creating some distance between him and the city. A humongous formation that was even larger than the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city was unleashed from his body, and it was swiftly expanding.

“Activate!”

With a roar, the formation swiftly contracted till it barely cloaked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, looking almost like armor.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist charged toward the gates.

Weng!

When he came into contact with the gates, he was stopped by an invisible barrier. He raised his hand and pressed it against the barrier, unleashing a burst of spirit power.

The world shook.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was fighting against the barrier. His tight frown and warped face made it apparent that he was struggling.

Boom!

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was suddenly jolted flying into the far distance. By the time he regained his balance, the formation armor around him was already crumbling. Fresh blood seeped from the corners of his lips.

In contrast, the Ancestral Martial Realm City’s main city looked the same as before, as if nothing had happened.

“As expected of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. Its reputation as the strongest world spiritist sect in the early years of the present era isn’t just for show. I guess I’m not fated with the great treasure trove inside for now,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist murmured.

He wasn’t surprised by the situation. He wiped the blood trail off his lips, not disappointed about his failure at all.

With a wave of his sleeves, he threw out a mirror. The mirror swiftly expanded till it was around the size of a smaller realm. It released a terrifying suction force, but this force was directed not at the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city but at the black light spirit formation gate behind.

The black light spirit formation gate and the energy the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had previously imbued into the protective formation, was absorbed by the mirror. As a result, the protective formation began reverting to normal.

The protective formation passed right through the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, enveloping it within its territory.

Once it was done, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist turned around and took his leave.

The formation that had previously enveloped the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and the woman in a white dress shattered with his departure. It turned out that the two of them didn’t die or turn into skeletons; instead, the injuries they previously suffered were greatly alleviated.

It turned out that the previous scene of them having their life force sucked out by the formation core was nothing but an illusion.
