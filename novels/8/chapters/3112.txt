Chapter 3112 - Conquering The Overlord Region

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief continued.

As for Chu Feng, he patiently listened to everything he said.

After hearing what the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said, Chu Feng finally gained a rough understanding of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

The Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was a place especially used for cultivation and training purposes.

There were a lot of strange cultivation resources located in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. It was precisely because of the existence of those cultivation resources that the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm became a genuine world for training and cultivating.

Moreover, the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm had existed since the Ancient Era.

All those within three hundred years of age, humans, monstrous beasts or otherwise, would all be able to enter it.

No one knew why the age limit was three hundred.

However, the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was, without a doubt, a miraculous place for martial cultivation.

The Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was covered by a grand formation that did not belong to any power. That grand formation operated automatically.

If one were within the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, one could exit it at any given time. However, entering the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm from the outside was a very difficult task.

There were no teleportation formations connecting to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. In order to enter it, one must rely on ‘Cultivation Keys.’

However, these Cultivation Keys were items that nobody was capable of crafting. Even the strongest world spiritists of the Ancestral Martial Starfield were incapable of the feat.

They were thus impossible to duplicate. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The reason for that was because the Cultivation Keys were items created by the formation that surrounded the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Every three years, Cultivation Keys would be produced.

Furthermore, the Cultivation Keys that emerged would not emerge from the formation around the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Instead, they would appear directly in the various Upper Realms.

That too revealed how extraordinary the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was.

It just so happened that this year was the year that the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm would produce Cultivation Keys again. Furthermore, the Chu Heavenly Clan had already obtained the Cultivation Keys that had appeared in their realm.

“These are the Cultivation Keys that will allow one to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?”

Chu Feng looked at the five bodies of light that were floating on the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s hand. A surprised expression was present in Chu Feng’s eyes.

Those five bodies of light were circular in shape. Each of them was the size of a pearl. If one had to describe them, they resembled five bubbles.

For keys to look like that, it was truly somewhat strange. After all, the five bodies of light simply did not resemble keys at all. However, the reason why Chu Feng suspected them to be the so-called Cultivation Keys was because he felt the power contained within those five bodies of light.

It was a sort of spirit power that not even he was capable of forming yet.

“Mn, these are the Cultivation Keys to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. To be exact, they are teleportation formations. Should you infuse your power into them, they will awaken and teleport you directly into the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm from here,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“They’re actually that powerful?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was surprised. Even though he was already able to feel how powerful the Cultivation Keys were, he did not expect for them to be so powerful as to be able to directly teleport their user into the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

One must know that the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was located in the central region of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. That place was extremely far away, unimaginably far from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

“These are treasures from the Ancient Era. They would naturally be extraordinary.”

“However, the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is not only a place with cultivation resources and chance encounters, it also contains dangers.”

“Chu Feng, you need to know this. In the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, apart from the people of the Starfield Master Realm that will never enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm to train, practically all the overlord powers from the various Upper Realms will dispatch their people to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm when it opens every three years.”

“Furthermore, the ones that are dispatched to train there are all very powerful.”

“Furthermore, as people from all the various powers are sent into it every three years, the inside of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm has been divided into five regions.”

“They are respectively the Eastern Region, Western Region, Southern Region, Northern Region and Overlord Region.”

“The different regions possess different cultivation resources. Without a doubt, the cultivation resources in the Overlord Region are the best.”

“However, entering the Overlord Region is extremely difficult. Furthermore, because there are too many powers involved, it is very difficult to obtain good cultivation resources even in the other four regions. After all, the people from the various powers will fight over the cultivation resources.”

“Inevitably, this will lead to battles among the various powers.”

“Even though there is a special power in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm that will protect everyone, making it so that no one will die in there, that does not mean that one cannot be tortured by others.”

“In fact, it is a frequent occasion for people to be tortured so much in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm that they’d end up having a mental breakdown, and going insane as a result,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“In that case, it would mean that the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is the epitome of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. Merely, the ones that train and compete with one another inside it are the younger generations from the various powers.” Chu Feng said.

“That is the case,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“In that case, what sort of status does our Chu Heavenly Clan possess in that Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?” Chu Feng asked.

“Our Chu Heavenly Clan belongs to the Eastern Region. Right now, our status is...” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not finish his words, but shook his head with a wry smile on his face.

His reaction showed Chu Feng what sort of status their Chu Heavenly Clan enjoyed in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Evidently, their Chu Heavenly Clan did not enjoy an ideal status in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

“Chu Feng, the power that could rule over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region is certainly the strongest in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

“Even though our Chu Heavenly Clan’s status inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is very bad right now, our Chu Heavenly Clan ruled over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm twice before.”

“The first time was with your grandfather.”

“As for the second time, it was your father.”

“I believe that you can bring our Chu Heavenly Clan into the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region again,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng.

Two expressions filled his eyes - hope and confidence.

He firmly believed that Chu Feng would be able to bring their Chu Heavenly Clan back into the Overlord Region.

Chu Feng felt the expectations the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had for him.

Thus, he clasped his fist and said, “Chu Feng will definitely spare no effort to bring our Chu Heavenly Clan back into that Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region. I will thrust our Chu Heavenly Clan’s banner onto the stage of the Overlord Region.”

Not only were Chu Feng’s words powerful, but they were also filled with emotions.

This was Chu Feng’s determination.

Ignoring the fact that he was a Chu Heavenly Clansman and had the duty to do such, he himself, as Chu Hanxian’s grandson and Chu Xuanyuan’s son, felt that he must bring their Chu Heavenly Clan back to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region.

Otherwise, he would end up disgracing the reputation of his grandfather and father.
