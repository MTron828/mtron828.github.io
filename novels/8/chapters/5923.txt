Chapter 5924: Tan Yu’s Recovery, Obtaining the Key Fragment

“You can say it’s a test, but it’s not exactly one. There are two ways to enter the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city. One is to first enter the main city before searching for the keys. The other is to first find the keys before uncovering the main city’s whereabouts.

“However, the main city was hidden away for various reasons back then, so the second method should have been the only plausible one, but surprisingly, someone in the present era managed to force the main city to reveal itself,” Sikong Changsheng remarked with a smile.

Chu Feng didn’t know how to answer that question. He knew that the person had made use of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s energy to force the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city to appear.

“I met a kind soul in the Tan Clan back then, so I left them with a key fragment. I was looking to help them, so I planted an awakening formation in their bloodline. It should have activated back then, but an incident resulted in me falling into a deep sleep. I didn’t expect to sleep for such a long time. I only woke up two hundred years ago.

“Fortunately, my bloodline awakening formation was passed down through the generations and had fallen into Tan Yu’s hands. By then, Tan Yu and his little sister had already lost their families and joined the Sunmoon Sect. They needed power more than ever, so I activated the bloodline awakening formation.

“The bloodline I have planted is manmade, so Tan Yu would have faced many difficulties in his cultivation even after it was awakened. He would have needed the help of someone with a keen eye for talent to achieve greatness. So, I changed the formation buried in the Tan Clan as well in hopes of luring someone over to help Tan Yu.

“I didn’t leave any explicit clues in the formation; it would take someone wise to figure out the connection with Tan Yu. Someone qualified to obtain the key fragment must be more than just kind; they have to be discerning and competent as a world spiritist too.

“I intended to have a kind and talented world spiritist help Tan Yu before guiding that individual to the key fragment in the Tan Clan. But my expectations fell short. No one noticed the connection between the change in the Tan Clan’s formation and Tan Yu’s bloodline awakening, and Tan Yu even faced a calamity as a result of his bloodline awakening.

“I had to wait two hundred years before you finally appeared.

“Under normal circumstances, you shouldn’t have been able to obtain the key fragment easily even if you helped Tan Yu, but since you have entered our Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city and cleared the test there, I’ll hand this key fragment to you.”

Sikong Changsheng pointed his finger at Chu Feng. A white imprint floated toward the latter and fused into his body.

“Return to the Tan Clan with this formation. You should be able to obtain the key fragment with this imprint.”

“Elder, you mentioned that Tan Yu would require help even after his bloodline awakened. Now that you have handed the key fragment to me, is there still a need to put those obstacles in Tan Yu’s path?” Chu Feng asked.

“It looks like you truly care about him. I didn’t misjudge you. Rest assured, he won’t face any problems with his bloodline in the future... though it’s a manmade bloodline, after all. There will be a cap on his accomplishments. He won’t be able to compete with true prodigies like you. Speaking of which, Chu Feng, please keep our meeting confidential,” Sikong Changsheng said.

“I understand.” Chu Feng nodded. Since the other party had refrained from interfering, the chances were that he didn’t want others to learn about his existence.

It was not easy for Chu Feng to meet such an old and powerful individual, so he wanted to use this opportunity to pose questions lingering in his mind, “Elder, do you know what happened in the later years of the Ancient Era?”

Sikong Changsheng shook his head.

“Where did the powerhouses in the early years of the present era go? Have they entered the Ninth Galaxy?” Chu Feng asked.

“You should search for the answers yourself. It’s more interesting that way.” Sikong Changsheng didn’t want to reveal too much about this. “I can’t tell you much, but it’s rare to find someone with talent and principles like you. You are a good bud. Let me offer a warning instead. Be wary of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and the Ancient Era’s clans.”

With that, the surrounding fog dissipated, and Chu Feng’s consciousness returned to his body. Both Chu Feng and Tan Yu opened their eyes at the same time.

Chu Feng wondered why such a powerful existence was warning him to be wary of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and the Ancient Era’s clans too.

He understood the case for the Ancient Era’s clans—they indubitably wielded great strength, having inherited the Ancient Era’s resources and having ample time to grow. But why was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion considered a huge threat too?

Tan Yu kneeled before Chu Feng. “Thank you, Lord Chu Feng.”

He could sense the changes in his body. Not only could he continue cultivating, but his cultivation had also recovered to the level before his dantian was dug out. What he dared not imagine before had come true!

And he knew this was all thanks to Chu Feng.

“Get up. There’s no need to thank me. You did me a huge favor too,” Chu Feng said as he helped Tan Yu to his feet.

“I... helped milord?” Tan Yu was confused.

“I’ll be frank with you, I don’t have prior ties with the Tan Clan. I went there for the Tan Clan’s formation. You should know about the formation, right?” Chu Feng asked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I do.” Tan Yu nodded.

“That formation can be deciphered, and I have now deciphered it. You don’t need to know the details; you just have to know that you have played a vital role in it. However, you should keep this matter confidential, or else it might bring trouble upon you.”

“I will keep it a secret.”

“Big brother Chu Feng, did you obtain the key fragment?” Zi Ling asked.

“Not yet, but it’s pretty much ours now,” Chu Feng replied.

“Who could have thought that the Tan Clan’s formation would be related to someone exiled from the Tan Clan? Only my big brother Chu Feng would think of that.” Zi Ling chuckled.

“My Zi Ling, you’re flattering me too much. I was lucky that Jie Tianran didn’t come here, or else he would have caught wind of this clue and found Tan Yu too,” Chu Feng replied.

“Do you think he would have been able to obtain the key fragment too?”

“Likely so.” Chu Feng still remembered Sikong Changsheng’s words, and Jie Tianran’s ability as a world spiritist was not to be underestimated.
