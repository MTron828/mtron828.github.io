Chapter 5542: Mysterious World

As Chu Feng stepped through the door, he felt a surge of energy manifesting within his body before flowing outward, eventually enveloping his entire being. It was just that he was too tired to pay much attention to this; he only wanted to leave this place as quickly as possible.

What appeared before his eyes was a mysterious world, but he was too tired to take another look that he ended up collapsing onto the ground and fainted.

He was out for a long time before slowly regaining consciousness.

The first thing he noticed was how unique the vast world before him was. It was made out of formations, be it the blue sky, white clouds, verdant mountains, or clear streams, and the traces of the formations were apparent to even ordinary mortals.

World spiritists tended to evaluate their skills based on how lifelike the worlds they had created were, but this world was the opposite. The formations comprising this world were clearly shown as if the creator was afraid that others couldn’t tell that this place wasn’t real.

It was not to say that these formations were incomplete or inferior; these formations were ingenious, far surpassing what Chu Feng was currently capable of. He was nowhere close to constructing a formation like this.

However, he merely took a brief glance at the world before looking behind him, where a formation lay parallel to the earth as if it was part of the ground. The formation was in an inactive state, but he could sense tremendous power harnessed within it.

He tried assessing it with his Heaven’s Eyes, but he couldn’t see through it or decipher its use. Nevertheless, he could tell that there was something special about it. Thus, he tried to take out his Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, only to realize that his Cosmos Sack had been sealed.

He couldn’t open his Cosmos Sack at all.

“What’s going on?”

Chu Feng was stunned.

He immediately turned his attention toward himself, only to realize that he couldn’t exert his martial power and spirit power anymore. Spirit power harnessing prowess comparable to a rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation World Spiritist was wrapped around his body.

“What’s going on, Chu Feng?” Eggy asked, noticing that something was amiss.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“My martial power and spirit power have been sealed off by a layer of spirit power that is comparable to that of a rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation World Spiritist. I can’t exert my cultivation, though I am able to channel the rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation spirit power,” Chu Feng said.

“Rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation? Are you certain?” Eggy was stunned.

“Yes, I’m certain,” Chu Feng replied.

“Why would this happen?” Eggy was perplexed.

Dragon Transformation Sensation was the power grasped by Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists. A rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation World Spiritist was roughly comparable to a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator.

Chu Feng was a rank three Half-God level cultivator and a Golden Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. How could mere rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation spirit power seal off his cultivation?

This was truly perplexing.

“Someone is coming,” Chu Feng suddenly said.

Moments later, a group of more than a hundred people dressed in similar uniforms could be seen heading in their direction. What was shocking about them was how identical they looked, be it their height, their physiques, or even their appearances.

Chu Feng had seen twins, triplets, and even quadruplets before, but he had never seen a hundred people with the same appearance. However, there were all kinds of wonders in the world of cultivation. With the means of a cultivator, it wasn’t unthinkable for there to be a hundred identical children in the world.

It was just that such means often led to defects in the children, which was why hardly anyone did so. Even powerful cultivators with unfathomable means opted to nurture their children in natural ways.

Only eccentric people with unusual preferences would resort to things like that.

“Chu Feng, what do the numbers on their bodies mean?” Eggy asked.

Chu Feng had also noticed that even though these people were dressed in the same robes, each of their robes was embroidered with its own unique ten-digit number.

“Eggy, they are cloaked in the same spirit power as me.”

Chu Feng didn’t understand the significance behind the numbers, but he noticed that they were cloaked in the same spirit power as well, just that theirs were even weaker. His was at rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, whereas theirs were only at rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.

“Could this be some kind of special trial ground?” Eggy guessed.

“It’s too early to say. Let’s ask them when they come closer,” Chu Feng replied as he rose into the sky and flew toward the group.

Even though he was unable to exert his martial power and spirit power, his observation means remained at the level of a rank three Half-God level cultivator and a Golden Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. This was why he spotted the group of hundred people before they even noticed him.

But as they got closer to each other, the group of hundred people soon noticed Chu Feng and lowered their heads deferentially. They quickly rushed forward and kneeled before him.

“Paying respects to milord!”

“Hm?” Chu Feng was taken aback, especially since he didn’t know these people at all.
