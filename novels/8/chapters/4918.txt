Chapter 4918: Assessing Strength

The moment Daoist Niantian said those words, Chu Feng’s body had already started moving. He was moved out of the manor and further away at an incredibly fast speed that caused his surroundings to blur.

Not only so, Shenggunag Buyu, Shengguang Baimei, and Prince Shenglong were also escaping along wih him.&nbsp;

It was Shengguang Baimei’s doing.&nbsp;

He was exerting his full strength to bring Chu Feng and the others away from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan as fast as possible. With him leading the way, Chu Feng was able to rest easy and turn his attention toward Daoist Niantian.&nbsp; Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Elder, you said that there was a formation in the hall?”

Chu Feng had examined the interiors of the hall earlier, but he didn’t find any formations. If there was truly a formation in there, it would mean that there was an incredibly powerful world spiritist in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.&nbsp;

“The formation was constructed in an incredibly delicate manner. The world spiritist behind it must be extremely skilled. I wouldn’t have noticed it if not for its activation,” Daoist Niantian said.&nbsp;

“It looks like the Nine Souls Sacred Clan isn’t to be looked down on,” Chu Feng said with a frown.

He was still able to retain his composure despite his anger. He knew that challenging a behemoth like the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was nothing to be made light of. It was not that he had no other alternatives here, but… his principles wouldn’t allow him to do so.

He also understood the limitations of his current strength. He knew that he had to rely on the Holy Valley if he wanted to avenge Xian Miaomiao as soon as possible.

So, he turned his eyes toward Shengguang Baimei and the others, clasped and fist, and said, “Elder Baimei, Elder Buyu, and Elder Niantian, I’m grateful for your help.”

He felt earnest gratitude toward them.

Regardless of their previous differences, he couldn’t refute the fact that they were helping him now. If not for them, he wouldn’t have been able to get this far. He would have already been captured back when he was still at Prince Shenglong Manor.

“Chu Feng, there’s no need to stand on ceremony with us. We’re making up for our faults with our contribution, right? Lord Baimei,” Shengguang Buyu shot a glance at Shengguang Baimei as he spoke.

Shengguang Baimei smiled awkwardly.

“Young hero Chu Feng, Elder Buyu is right. I have done you an injustice. Even though it’s a misunderstanding, that doesn’t absolve what I’ve done to you. In any case, we’re on the same boat now.

“From this day on, your affairs would be the affairs of our Holy Valley. Feel free to speak if you have any problems. Our Holy Valley will spare no efforts at helping you. You need not worry about the situation here too. We’ve already left the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, and I doubt that they’ll be able to track us down,” Shengguang Baimei said proudly.

Within this short period of time, he had already brought Chu Feng and the others far away out of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.&nbsp;

“Besides, so what if they manage to track us down? I have only chosen to leave just to spare us from the hassle. Other than the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief, none of them has the power to stop me!” Shengguang Baimei said.

“Elder, do you know how powerful the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief is?” Chu Feng asked.

The culprit behind Xian Miaomiao’s death was none other than the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief. That was an enemy he would have to face eventually.

It would be good if he could have a gauge on how powerful the other party was.

“Based on what I know, he has already reached rank nine Martial Exalted level many years ago. I admit that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief is indeed more powerful than me, but our Holy Monarch would be able to deal with him easily.

‘So, young hero Chu Feng, if you wish to exact vengeance, there’s no need to rush things now. You can wait till our Holy Monarch comes out of his closed-door training and seek his help. Of course, if you wish to look for Princess Xiaoxiao now, we’ll come with you too.”

Shengguang Baimei’s words sounded extremely sincere. Even Chu Feng felt moved by his sentiments.

“Rank nine Martial Exalted level? That means that you’re at rank eight Martial Exalted level?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s embarrassing, but I’m indeed at rank eight Martial Exalted level. I’m only a step away from rank nine Martial Exalted level, but despite having cultivated for many years, I’m still unable to find the impetus required for a breakthrough. If I had your talent, I should have already taken the final step forward a long time ago.”

Shengguang Baimei couldn’t help but look at Chu Feng in envy.

Having cultivated for so many years, he knew just how important it was to have talent. Despite the great power he wielded, he knew that he couldn’t compete with many of the current juniors in the Holy Valley in terms of talent, let alone with Chu Feng.&nbsp;

Chu Feng had a rough idea of what he was up against now.&nbsp;

He had only asked Shengguang Baimei about his cultivation so as to get a gauge of the difference in strength. He knew that he wouldn’t stand a chance against Shengguang Baimei, so it was unlikely that he would be able to rival the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief anytime soon.&nbsp;

He was a little surprised to learn that Shengguang Baimei wasn’t as strong as he had expected. He thought that the latter had already reached the pinnacle of Martial Exalted level, but who could have thought that he was only at rank eight?

Admittedly, rank eight Martial Exalted level was still an existence that the current Chu Feng couldn’t deal with, but it didn’t seem that far away.

With his current means, he could already raise his cultivation up to rank six Martial Exalted level. If he could just raise his cultivation by another three ranks, he should be able to fight on equal grounds with Shengguang Baimei and possibly even defeat him.&nbsp;

As for why it was three ranks and not two ranks, it was because Chu Feng knew that Shengguang Xuanye had the ability to raise his cultivation through his bloodline ability. It only stood to reason that Shengguang Baimei could do the same too.&nbsp;

Shengguang Baimei should be able to raise his cultivation to rank nine Martial Exalted level after raising his cultivation, so Chu Feng would have to at least reach rank six Martial Exalted level in order to deal with him.&nbsp;

Of course, this was assuming that Chu Feng didn’t use the Heavenly Lightning Nine Levels Slash. If he were to resort to that, he wouldn’t have to raise his cultivation by three ranks.

It was just a pity that he wasn’t able to completely control the Heavenly Lightning Nine Levels Slash.&nbsp;
