Chapter 2239 - Formation Of The Immortal-cloak

“In that case, it means that it is not Lord True Immortal that interfered, but rather Chu Feng who had managed to control the Immortal-level spirit power himself?” After things were cleared up, the crowd became even more astonished.

“Chu Feng, we are not done with you!!!”

Right at that moment, the three brothers inside the comprehensive formation suddenly let out furious shouts.

Upon turning their gazes toward them, the crowd discovered that the three brothers were already sealed in a spirit formation.

That spirit formation caused them to be unable to comprehend the slightest trace of Immortal-level spirit power.

At that moment, the vast amount of Immortal-level spirit power in the comprehensive formation was continuously pounding against only Chu Feng.

“That’s the end!!!”

Seeing this scene, many people revealed smiles.

The three brothers were simply unable to break through the spirit formation Chu Feng had sealed them with. The reason for that was because not only was Chu Feng’s spirit formation extremely profound, but he had also managed to control Immortal-level spirit power to assist him.

With the Immortal-level spirit power serving as a foundation, no matter what sorts of treasures the three brothers possessed, they were still unable to break through Chu Feng’s spirit formation.

As such, they could only watch as Chu Feng enjoyed the boundless Immortal-level spirit power by himself without being able to do anything.

Hatred. At that moment, the three brothers’ eyes were filled with concentrated hatred. They were itching to skin Chu Feng alive and drink his blood.

“Woosh~~~” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly opened his tightly closed eyes. He looked at the three brothers as his lips raised into a smile.

“The three of you were originally able to enjoy the Immortal-level spirit power together with me.”

“Yet, you three insisted on using tricks against me. You have forced me to this. This was caused by your overestimation of your capabilities. You all have reaped what you’ve sown,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, after leaving Mount Cloud Crane, we will definitely take your dog life!!!” The three brothers said furiously.

However, their threatening words only managed to obtain a light smile from Chu Feng. He said, “Don’t speak as if you all would have spared me if I didn’t go against you.”

“At the moment I broke through that purple fog, you all had already determined to kill me. However, you all must not know that I dared to go against you four brothers because I did not place you all in my eyes.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he ignored the expressions of the three brothers, closed his eyes and began to continue to comprehend the profoundness contained in the Immortal-level spirit power.

“You damned bastard, you dare to look down on us like this?!” Faced with Chu Feng acting like that, not to mention the three brothers inside the spirit formation, even the seriously injured eldest brother was filled with overwhelming fury.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s body began to completely absorb all of the vast and boundless amount of Immortal-level spirit power like a bottomless pit.

After the Immortal-level spirit power was all absorbed into Chu Feng’s body, the comprehensive formation started to shatter.

“This!!!” Seeing that scene, the expressions of the crowd all changed. They did not understand exactly what was happening before them.

“Buzz~~~”

At the moment when the crowd was confused, Chu Feng’s body suddenly let out a vast amount of Immortal-level spirit power.

Merely, the Immortal-level spirit power that he emitted was completely different from the Immortal-level spirit power that had entered his body before.

Earlier, Dragon Mark Immortal-level spirit power had entered his body.

And now, although it also very pure, it was Insect Mark Immortal-level spirit power that was being emitted.

The Immortal-level spirit power that he emitted was clearly many times weaker. However, upon seeing the Immortal-level spirit power, the people present all revealed astonished expressions.

“Chu Feng, he, he, he....”

“Could it be that he has already become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” someone said in excitement.

“Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Chu Feng succeeded?” At that moment, in terms of being happy, no one’s happiness could surpass Liu Xiaoli’s. After all, as long as Chu Feng became an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he would be able to treat her master Liu Chengkun’s illness.

“Grandmaster Pocket, did Chu Feng... really become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” Someone turned to ask Grandmaster Pocket because they did not dare to believe their eyes, did not dare to believe that Chu Feng had become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Almsgiver Chu Feng possesses exceptional talent. He has indeed become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

“He is so young, yet has already become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. There have only been two people who have accomplished this feat in the history of our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Grandmaster Pocket was full of praises for Chu Feng.

After verifying that Chu Feng had become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, the gazes with which the crowd looked to Chu Feng changed once again.

An Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. An Asura World Spiritist. A man this young.

Genius. This was most definitely the sign of an exceptional genius!!!

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, a ray of light suddenly shone from the sky and enveloped Chu Feng.

When that ray of light dissipated, Chu Feng had also disappeared.

At that moment, Chu Feng had arrived above the clouds.

Merely, Chu Feng was simply unable to see the Golden Crane True Immortal, and was only able to hear his voice.

“You are called Chu Feng?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.

“Senior, this junior is indeed called Chu Feng,” Chu Feng replied.

“You are extremely talented in terms of world spirit techniques. You are a rarely-seen genius.”

“However, the more talented one is, the more others will envy them. You are destined to become famous after today; a misfortune, perhaps. There will be two kinds of people that will notice you.”

“The first kind will be those who will want to attract you because they cherish of talent.”

“The other kind will be those who will want to kill you out of their jealousy toward you.”

“However, even those who want to attract you might end up becoming people who will want to kill you. The world of martial cultivation is filled with dangers everywhere. You need to prepare yourself.”

“Thank you, Lord True Immortal, for pointing this out to me. It was all thanks to Lord True Immortal that this Chu Feng could become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

Although Chu Feng was unable to see the Golden Crane True Immortal, he was grateful toward the Golden Crane True Immortal. Thus, he respectfully bowed in the direction that the Golden Crane True Immortal’s voice was coming from.

“You have become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist by relying on your own comprehension. There is not too much of a relationship with me. Thus, you do not have to thank me, it was all thanks to your own abilities.”

“This Immortal is also a person who cherishes talents. As a talent like you is very rare, I have prepared a meager gift for you.”

Once the Golden Crane True Immortal’s words were said, a sandalwood case floated out from the fog and arrived before Chu Feng.

Chu Feng received the case and opened it. Immediately, his eyes shone. Contained in the case were three medicinal pellets. The three medicinal pellets were three different colors. Each and every one of them contained an enormous amount of medicinal power. Furthermore, each one was stronger than the last.

Chu Feng was able to tell that the medicinal powers of those medicinal pellets were related to one’s world spirit techniques.

“Senior, may I know what these medicinal pellets are?” Chu Feng asked.

“Those are Immortal Transformation Pellets. They are specially created for Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.”

“Upon using the Immortal Transformation Pellets, your Heavenly Bloodline will temporarily be sealed. You will not be able to use your Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings. Even your heaven-defying battle power will disappear. However, your cultivation will increase enormously.”

“I have prepared three such Immortal Transformation Pellets for you.”

“The first one is capable of increasing your cultivation to rank three Martial Ancestor.”

“The second one is capable of increasing your cultivation to rank four Martial Ancestor.”

“As for the third one, it is capable of increasing your cultivation to rank five Martial Ancestor.”

“Perhaps these three Immortal Transformation Pellets will be able to save your life in times of danger,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.
