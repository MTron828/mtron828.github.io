Chapter 4905: Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium

“I’m not opposed to allowing Chu Feng to enter our Martial Skills Compendium. It’s just that even Elder Niantian, despite having done us a big favor, wasn’t entitled to such treatment. Since we’re opening the Martial Skills Compendium anyway, I suggest that we allow Elder Niantian to enter the premises too.”

Shengguang Shishen and Shengguang Baimei heaved a sigh of relief.

It would be problematic if Shengguang Menglai opposed their proposal as she was the sole child of the Holy Monarch, making her as good as the princess of the Holy Valley.&nbsp;

Even though she had no official position, there were few in the Holy Valley who dared to go against her. If she was really against Chu Feng entering the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium, even Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Shishen would be put in a spot.

“Miss Menglai, thank you for your goodwill, but I’ll have to pass on the offer. I know that the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium is a place where esteemed guests of the Holy Valley are granted entry. As an honorary guest elder of the Holy Valley, I’m also considered to be a member of the Holy Valley too. It would be inappropriate for me to enter the Martial Arts Compendium as a guest,” Daoist Niantian replied.&nbsp;

He did contribute to the Holy Valley previously, and the Holy Valley had once considered opening the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium for him. However, he was eventually denied entry.&nbsp;

This was also the reason why he felt glad for Chu Feng when Shengguang Baimei proposed the idea. He knew that this was the highest honor that any guest could receive from the Holy Valley, and he did want this honor too.

But he didn’t want to rob Chu Feng of his chance of entering the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium, so he could only turn down the offer.

“Elder Niantian has indeed contributed much to our Holy Valley. Since Miss Menglai has already said so, I’ll decide on the Holy Monarch’s behalf and grant Elder Niantian entry to our Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium too,” Shengguang Shishen said.

He turned to Shengguang Baimei and asked, “Baimei, you have no qualms with that, right?”

“I’m fine with it.”

It went without saying that Shengguang Baimei was strongly opposed to it. In fact, he was the one who fought hard to deny Daoist Niantian of his opportunity to access the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium.

But he knew that he had no choice but to give in if he wanted to win Chu Feng’s goodwill here. After all, it was clear that Chu Feng was on close terms with Daoist Niantian based on their interactions thus far.

“It looks like good things come in pairs. My congratulations to Elder Niantian,” Shengguang Xintian said with a smile.

Even Shengguang Menglai also had a faint smile on her lips.

“Elder Niantian, please enter our Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium together with young hero Chu Feng as an esteemed guest of our Holy Valley,” Shengguang Menglai said.

“I’m grateful for the opportunity, Miss Menglai, Lord Baimei, and Lord Shishen. Since that’s the case, I won’t stand on ceremony anymore. Hahaha…”

It was a rare hearty chuckle from Daoist Niantian. He was truly interested in entering the Holy Light Martial Arts Compendium.

“It looks like the Martial Arts Compendium is a good place. May I know when we can enter its premises?” Chu Feng asked.

He didn’t know much about the Holy Light Martial Arts Compendium, but based on the reactions from those around him, he could guess that it was an important place to the Holy Valley.&nbsp;

“We’ll head over right now, Young friend Chu Feng, this way please.”&nbsp;

Shengguang Baimei immediately began leading the way.

Chu Feng and the others began making their way to the Holy Light Martial Arts Compendium, and Long Xiaoxiao followed him closely.

“Cough cough…”

However, Shengguang Baimei suddenly interjected with a light cough.

“This young miss over here, the Holy Light Martial Arts Compendium is our Holy Valley’s forbidden land. Would it be fine if I arrange for a resting place for you first?”

Long Xiaoxiao understood that this was Shengguang Baimei’s way of saying that she wasn’t welcomed, but she was not the kind of person who couldn’t read the situation. So, she took her leave and allowed another elder to bring her to a resting place.&nbsp;

Shortly after Long Xiaoxiao left, Shengguang Xintian suddenly walked over to Chu Feng’s side and said, “Chu Feng, you don’t know much about our Holy Light Martial Arts Compendium. I’ll accompany you in later on. Feel free to ask me if there’s anything you’re uncertain about.”

Shengguang Xintian seemed to be in a good mood. Her large eyes were filled with delight, and her eyes were curled into beautiful crescents. Even Chu Feng had to admit that she had a beautiful smile.

She was walking extremely close to Chu Feng such that he could feel a soft sensation against his arm from time to time.&nbsp;

He shifted sideward a little in response, but it was futile.&nbsp;

Shengguang Xintian would move along with him, causing their bodies to remain in proximity.

“Haven’t you heard that a man and a woman should keep some distance between each other?” Chu Feng turned to Shengguang Xintian and said.

“I never thought that I would hear such words from you. You insisted on having me kiss you inside the Holy Lotus Tree, but here you are, talking to me about keeping distance. Are you trying to pretend to be pure and innocent after what you have done?” Shengguang Xintian looked at Chu Feng with a provocative smile.

Those words immediately drew everyone’s gazes toward Chu Feng, especially Shengguang Baimei’s.

“Cough cough… I only said those words to anger Shengguang Haoxuan because I could tell that he has thoughts about you. Please don’t misunderstand, I’m not a lecherous person. Even if Miss Xintian agrees to it, I wouldn’t really kiss her,” Chu Feng quickly clarified.

He didn’t think that he was a gentleman, but he would prefer it if others didn’t think of him as a sex fiend. He also did mean what he had just said too.

“It’s normal for youngsters to crack such jokes,” Shengguang Baimei commented with a smile.

Those words made everyone realize that Shengguang Baimei was indeed fearful of Chu Feng and was intent on forging a good relationship with Chu Feng. They knew just how strict Shengguang Baimei was to his granddaughter.

There was once a junior of the Holy Valley who secretly wrote a love letter to Shengguang Xintian. When Shengguang Baimei learned about it, he broke the hands of that junior.&nbsp;

Privately, Shengguang Baimei also confronted that junior numerous times to teach him a lesson.&nbsp;

In fact, even Shengguang Baimei had also taught Shengguang Haoxuan a lesson for daring to approach his granddaughter.&nbsp;

In his view, all men ought to keep their distance from his granddaughter. He wouldn’t allow any rascals to take advantage of her.

Yet, he didn’t fly into a fit of anger upon learning about what Chu Feng did to Shengguang Xintian. Instead, he chose to smile and respond in an amicable manner. This was more than enough to tell everyone the attitude he had taken toward Chu Feng.&nbsp;

There was a good mix of laugh and chatter amongst the crowd, alleviating the atmosphere.&nbsp;

These people from the Holy Valley were the same ones who tried to kill Chu Feng earlier on, but there wasn’t the slightest bit of killing intent from them at all. All that was left was an air of harmony.

Soon, they arrived at the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium.

From the outside, the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium wasn’t any grand palace. It was just a wooden gate that towered over a thousand meters tall affixed to the side of a mountain cliff with a wooden plaque labeled ‘Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium’.

Both the wooden door and the plaque looked incredibly old, and there was no one guarding the area. An outsider would have never been able to imagine that this was such an important place to the Holy Valley.

However, Chu Feng was still able to tell with a glance that this was no ordinary place.

Despite its shabby appearance, there was a barrier shrouding it that clearly came from the hands of an incredibly powerful world spiritist. Putting aside Chu Feng, even those who had reached the pinnacle of Martial Exalted level would be helpless before the barrier. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

It was unguarded simply because there was no need to station anyone here.
