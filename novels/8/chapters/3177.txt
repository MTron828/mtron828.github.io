Chapter 3177 - Voice Of The Devil

At that moment, everyone, regardless of whether they might be the Mighty Dongguo Duo, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan or their subsidiary powers, they all had an identical expression on their faces - astonishment.

They did not understand why Bai Liluo would proclaim herself to be Chu Feng’s big sister.

Exactly what sort of relationship did that frightening existence have with Chu Feng?

"Miss Liluo, what is the meaning of this...?"

Qingyu Yunlong was the first to speak. He wanted to gain an answer through questioning Bai Liluo.

This time around, Bai Liluo did not ignore Qingyu Yunlong’s question.

She smiled lightly. She looked to the crowd and then spoke as if in sudden realization, "Oh, I nearly forgot to mention to everyone. I have indeed joined the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, and am their guest elder now."

Once Bai Liluo said those words, she immediately caused the Chu Heavenly Clansmen and the Mighty Dongguo Duo to frown.

The reason for that was because what Bai Liluo said was clearly meant for them. She was trying to tell them her identity.

As for Bai Liluo’s identity as the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s guest elder, it was an extremely detrimental identity for the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Mighty Dongguo Duo.

As a guest elder, she would be akin to a member of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. Standing at her position, she would naturally not disregard the battle between the Dragon and Tiger Brothers and the Mighty Dongguo Duo.

Compared to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen and the Mighty Dongguo Duo, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen and their subsidiary powers reacted as if they were given cardiac stimulants. The unease in their hearts instantly dispersed.

Since even Bai Liluo herself said it like that, it was clear that she would still be standing on the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s side.

However, at the moment when the Mighty Dongguo Duo were filled with worries, and when the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen were filled with joy, Bai Liluo added, "However, there is one thing that I need to have everyone understand. This Chu Feng, he..."

As Bai Liluo said those words, she pointed her fair-skinned little hand at Chu Feng. With a beaming smile, she said, "Chu Feng, he’s the little brother of I, Bai Liluo. If anyone dares to make an enemy out of him, they’ll be making an enemy out of me, Bai Liluo. Regardless of who it might be, I, Bai Liluo, will definitely not spare them."

"What? Little brother?"

Bai Liluo’s words came like a sudden clap of thunder. The Mighty Dongguo Duo and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were completely puzzled, whereas the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan and their subsidiary powers started becoming uneasy.

That said, the ones feeling the most uneasy right now would be none other than Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys.

After Bai Liluo said those words, they finally realized why she had suddenly attacked them.

At the same time, they also realized how dire of a situation they were in.

"It seems that there are a lot of people present today who have conflicts with my little brother."

"Since I’ve encountered this, I have no way to pretend not to see it."

Bai Liluo suddenly turned her gaze to the Burnfield Monstrous Clan.

She looked to the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen with a beaming smile on her face. Her eyes appeared so very innocent.

However, being looked upon by that innocent gaze, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen all became very nervous and uneasy.

At the beginning, they only turned deathly pale. However, they soon started to cold sweat, and shiver from head to toe.

Following that, there were actually people among them that turned around and began to flee in their kneeling state.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, heaven and earth started to tremble violently.

In the next moment, the fleeing Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were all crushed to the ground like dying dogs.

No, it was not only those fleeing Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen. At that moment, all of the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were crushed to the ground by a powerful oppressive might.

“Burnfield Monstrous Clan, you all are truly bold. Not only did you all decide to make an enemy out of my little brother, you all even went as far as to seek the help of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. Fortunately, this young lady is here today. Otherwise, the consequences would have been truly unthinkable.”

“If I don’t teach you all a proper lesson, you won’t know what sort of person I, Bai Liluo, am.”

Seeing that the situation was very bad, Fenye Ganghao hurriedly said, “Lady Liluo, please stay your hand. We simply had no idea that Chu Feng was your little brother.”

His voice was trembling. In fact, he sounded like he was on the verge of crying.

The crowd was able to understand Fenye Ganghao’s reaction. After all, the one they were facing was none other than the monster, Bai Liluo.

“Humph,” to the crowd’s surprise, Bai Liluo merely let out a cold snort at Fenye Ganghao’s words. Then she waved her arm, and boundless martial power was sent forth from her sleeve.

In the blink of an eye, the golden-bright and dazzling martial power turned crimson. Countless crimson snakes were formed. Those crimson snakes all flew toward the people from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan and enveloped them completely.

This time around, those crimson snakes were not merely binding the receiving party. After binding them, the snakes began to creep around their bodies.

The sharp scales of the snakes began to slide through the bodies of the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen after piercing into them. The scales ripped apart their flesh and cut apart their bones.

Most importantly, the fang-covered and poisonous gas-filled mouths of the snakes began to tear at the bodies of the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen nonstop.

“Eeaaahhh~~~”

At that moment, miserable screams began resounding nonstop. The Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were experiencing incomparable suffering.

“Miss Liluo, what are you doing?”

“The Burnfield Monstrous Clan are our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s subsidiary power! How could you attack them?! Quickly, cease your attacks!!!”

Seeing that Bai Liluo was actually attacking the Burnfield Monstrous Clan, QIngyu Yunlong spoke with an expression of shock.

He was not the only one that was stunned by Bai Liluo’s actions. All of the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan and their subsidiary powers were completely astonished.

The reason for that was because none of them had anticipated that their strongest trump card would turn her murderous gaze toward them from the very start.

“Shut up! If you dare utter another word, I will have you suffer the same fate as them.”

Bai Liluo suddenly turned her gaze to Qingyu Yunlong. Her originally beautiful eyes were filled with coldness.

Those... were simply not a human’s eyes. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing Bai Liluo’s current gaze, even someone as powerful as Qingyu Yunlong started to tremble with fear. He forcibly swallowed the words that he had planned to say.

He knew that he could not say anything anymore. After all, Bai Liluo was simply no ordinary person. Instead, she was a lunatic. If he dared to say anything else, she might really end up attacking him.

During that period of time, crimson snakes were forming from Bai Liluo’s sleeve repeatedly.

All of the snakes that were formed immediately flew toward the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen.

The people present were able to clearly witness the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen being densely covered and enveloped by those crimson snakes. Not even an inch of their skin could be seen.

Although the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were no longer visible, the crowd heard their miserable screams. Those screams caused everyone present to feel very uneasy. Not even Chu Feng was an exception.

Through his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to see the destruction that the crimson snakes were causing the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen.

The crimson snakes were most definitely not bringing them simple physical torment. Instead, more than physical, they were tearing apart the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen’s souls. It was a torture of one’s psyche.

As the crimson snakes continued with their torture, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen’s violent and howling screams began to gradually weaken.

The people present all knew that the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were no longer able to withstand the torture.

“Woosh~~~”

Finally, Bai Liluo waved her sleeve, and the crimson snakes that enveloped the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen all began to disperse.

However, at that moment, the expressions of the crowd present all changed. Unconcealable terror filled their faces.

Everyone from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan, including Fenye Ganghao, had been completely mutilated beyond recognition.

They barely had any flesh left on their bodies. They resembled skeletons with some meat remaining. They were shivering whilst curled up on the ground.

They no longer resembled the clansmen of a powerful monstrous clan. Instead, they were like a group of people on the verge of death after being tortured.

Right at that moment, Bai Liluo’s voice was heard, “All of you, listen carefully. Inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, I don’t care who you might be, if anyone dares to make an enemy of my little brother, they shall suffer the consequences like the Burnfield Monstrous Clan today.”

Even though her voice was still that of a child, everyone tensed up upon hearing those words.

The reason for that was because that voice was simply not a child’s voice at all. Instead, it was the voice of the devil.
