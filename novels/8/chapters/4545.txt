Chapter 4545: Chu Lingxi’s Breakthrough

After Long Xiaoxiao’s departure, all that was left in the area were the juniors from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

“My little sisters, did you hear those words? They said that my Brother Chu Feng saved their lives. Not only so, but he’s also the benefactor of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Yu Heavenly Clan, and Monstrous Herd Temple!” Kong Tianhui looked at the others with widened eyes as he exclaimed.

“Yes yes, we have ears too in case you haven’t noticed. We heard their words loud and clear,” Kong Ci replied.

“It’s no wonder why all of them treat Brother Chu Feng so respectfully. Even powerhouses like the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s sectmaster, Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, and Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief treat him with such amicable attitudes!

“As it turned out, Brother Chu Feng is their benefactor!” Wuming Xiongmo remarked with wonderment.

“Brother Chu Feng is already at a completely different level from us now,” Wuming Yuanzhi said.

Those words brought about nods of agreement from the others.

It was a little disheartening to see someone who used to be with them rising so far beyond their reach whereas they were still stationary on the spot, but nevertheless, there were still delighted smiles on their faces. They were Chu Feng’s friends, and they earnestly felt happy for him to see how far he had come, especially after all of the adversities he had been through.

Triumphing over challenges after challenges, the adversaries of yesterday were no longer with a mention to him anymore.

“It looks like we’ll never be able to catch up to that fellow in our lifetime,” Kong Ci suddenly remarked.

“You’re right, it doesn’t look like we stand a chance anymore.”

The group smiled wryly to themselves.

As those from the same generation as Chu Feng, it had once crossed their minds that they should try devoting themselves all in and try to catch up with Chu Feng.

However, all of them had ended up resigning themselves to fate. They knew that no matter what they did, they would never be able to catch up with Chu Feng anymore.

“Catch up with Brother Chu Feng? Such a thought has never crossed my mind before. All I feel now is just curiosity,” Kong Tianhui said.

“Curiosity? About what?” the group asked.

“I’m curious to find out how far Brother Chu Feng can go at this rate,” Kong Tianhui said.

Those words brought anticipation to the faces in the group. They also shared the same thoughts as well.

...

Meanwhile, Chu Feng entered the residence together with Gu Mingyuan.

Gu Mingyuan used a special means to seal off the residence so that she could talk to Chu Feng privately without anyone eavesdropping. Due to that, Chu Feng was finally able to find out just what had happened.

In the end, it turned out that it wasn’t a coincidence at all that Chu Lingxi ended up getting eyed by Lu Wantong. It was Gu Yang who orchestrated it all.

Gu Yang was an ambitious man who hoped to make the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield one day.

When Gu Mingyuan was still younger, Gu Yang treated her quite well because he thought that she had the talent to fulfill his vision. Initially, Gu Mingyuan did share the same ambitions as him, but as she lost time and time again to Chu Feng’s father, her passion gradually faded.

Following that, when the Chu Heavenly Clan finally became the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it became even more impossible for Gu Mingyuan to challenge the top seat of the Ancestral Martial Starfield as she would risk turning the Chu Heavenly Clan into her enemy.

As a result, this ambition appeared to have completely died out by this point.

But while it was impossible for Gu Mingyuan to make a move on the Chu Heavenly Clan due to Chu Lingxi, it didn’t mean that the entire Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan agreed with her decision.

Gu Yang was one example. He had never forgotten his ultimate goal all this while, not even once.

After seeing that the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan no longer stood a chance at overthrowing the Chu Heavenly Clan with its own prowess anymore. Gu Yang turned to look for alternative solutions.

It was out of coincidence that Gu Yang came to be acquainted with Lu Wantong. When he learned that Lu Wantong had a deep fascination for female cultivators who were both talented and beautiful, the first thing that came to his mind was that he could offer Chu Lingxi up to Lu Wantong in exchange for his aid.

And with the power and influence Lu Wantong commanded, the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan would finally be able to put the Ancestral Martial Starfield under its thumb!

Thus, Gu Yang took the initiative to approach Lu Wantong and tell him about Chu Lingxi.

When Lu Wantong learned that there was actually such a gem hidden amidst the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, his lust was stoked. He immediately demanded Gu Yang to bring Chu Lingxi to him.

Everything else happened just as Chu Feng knew it.

Under the tip-off from Gu Yang, Lu Wantong was able to camp outside the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation and catch a glimpse of Chu Lingxi. He was enamored with her right away, so she began to coerce him to marry her.

When Gu Mingyuan learned that Gu Yang was behind all of this, she was infuriated.

As a member of the clan, she did hope for the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan to rise to greater heights, but not at the expense of selling her own daughter! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She would have had Gu Yang killed right away if not for Lu Wantong threatening to obliterate the entire Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan if any harm were to come to Gu Yang.

Considering that Lu Wantong did have the ability to pull that off, Gu Mingyuan was left with no choice but to swallow her fury.

“Elder, it isn’t just because of Lu Wantong’s threat that you didn’t kill Gu Yang. More than that, it’s because you still harbor some kinship toward him.”

The reason why Chu Feng was saying this was because he understood just what kind of person Gu Mingyuan was. She wasn’t the type to hold back in the face of threats.

“Ey, it looks like I really can’t hide anything from you. I’m infuriated by his actions, but at the same time, I’m also indebted to him because of all he has done for me so far. He’s a family member who carries a lot of weight in my heart.

“I have no qualms with punishing him, but I really can’t bring myself to take his life,” Gu Mingyuan said with a bitter smile.

Chu Feng could more or less understand how Gu Mingyuan was feeling at the moment.

But all of a sudden, Chu Feng suddenly sensed something, and his eyes narrowed a little.

He quickly turned his sight toward the southeast direction, and he noticed the presence of a room there.

“Elder, open the doors. I’ll help Lingxi,” Chu Feng told Gu Mingyuan.

“Chu Feng, you’re able to see what Lingxi is doing?” Gu Mingyuan asked in astonishment.

Given the sharpness of Chu Feng’s eyes, it wasn’t too difficult for him to figure out what Lingxi was doing. The latter was cultivating at the moment, and she was reaching a crucial phase.

If she managed to make a breakthrough, she would be able to advance to Utmost Exalted level. Otherwise, she would suffer a heavy rebound.

“Elder, open the doors. Lingxi needs my help right now. I’m sure you don’t want Lingxi to ruin her future over a moment of hastiness, right?” Chu Feng told Gu Mingyuan urgently.

Those words made Gu Mingyuan realize how severe this matter was. She quickly took out a key and opened the door for Chu Feng to enter.

When the door opened, a spirit formation gate appeared before their eyes. Beyond the gate was a small sealed world covered in frost.

In the middle of this world, there was a lotus that emanated a golden radiance, and Chu Lingxi was seated on top of this lotus with her eyes tightly close, focused on her cultivation.

Due to how focused she was, Chu Lingxi was completely oblivious to Chu Feng’s approach.

Chu Feng knew that this golden lotus was a unique cultivation treasure that carried a high level of compatibility with Chu Lingxi’s Ancient Clan Bloodline.

However, there were downsides to using this golden lotus too. If Chu Lingxi were to fail to make a breakthrough on this golden lotus, she would have to pay a heavy price for her failure.

In truth, Chu Feng had already noticed Chu Lingxi from the moment he walked into the residence. He knew that she was cultivating, but as everything was still proceeding fine earlier, he refrained from interrupting her.

However, just a moment ago, a frown formed on Chu Lingxi’s forehead, and her aura began to waver as well.This made Chu Feng, who had plenty of experiences with breakthroughs, realize that she had encountered a problem in her cultivation.

As such, he immediately asked Gu Mingyuan to let him in so that he could help Chu Lingxi.

Chu Feng quickly began constructing a formation with his spirit power. During the process, he took out quite a lot of different cultivation treasures and fused them into his formation.

Upon seeing this sight, even Gu Mingyuan couldn’t retain her composure anymore.

Putting aside the fact that the cultivation treasures he had brought out were all invaluable items, even the spirit formation that he was constructing pulsated with tremendous strength that was far beyond what she expected.

She only heard that Chu Feng had made a significant breakthrough in his cultivation, allowing him to defeat Wuming Doutian. However, she didn’t think that Chu Feng would manage to make such a great advancement in his world spiritist techniques too.

With his current skills, not even Master Liang Qiu from the Ancestral Martial Starfield could come close to him.

Under Chu Feng’s aid, the frown on Chu Lingxi’s forehead gradually smoothened out, and her aura slowly started to calm down. At the same time, the rate at which she absorbed the power from the golden lotus increased as well.

Soon enough, Chu Lingxi’s aura began transforming.

Sensing the changes in Chu Lingxi’s aura, Gu Mingyuan clasped her mouth in shock, and even her eyes began reddening a little.

Chu Lingxi’s aura had just risen from pinnacle Exalted level to Utmost Exalted level.

Even though it was only rank one Utmost Exalted level, which was nothing compared to the top-notch prodigies of the Holy Light Galaxy, it was a big deal in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

To Gu Mingyuan, who had great expectations of Chu Lingxi, this was definitely a huge moment. Her daughter had already caught up with her cultivation despite her young age.

It had already become an inevitability that her daughter would surpass her in the future.

Gazing upon her daughter, Gu Mingyuan couldn’t help but nod proudly. Without a doubt, her daughter was going to become the star that would lead their clan to greater heights.
