Chapter 4131 - The Opportunity To Make A Breakthrough

“Brother Chu Feng, this is an enormous opportunity for you that only appears once in a blue moon.”

“Thus we cannot leave. We cannot have you miss out on this opportunity,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Brother Shaoyu, I know that you’re thinking for my sake.”

“However, there is no such thing as a free meal in this world.”

“Whether it be that Zuoqiu Hanxun’s previous conduct or that Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s reputation, they all served to illustrate that they are not good people.”

“As such, their behavior today is extremely abnormal.”

“I feel that they are not treating us well because they treasure talents. It is very likely that they plan to take advantage of us,” said Chu Feng.

The reason why Chu Feng wanted to leave at the start was because he felt that something was amiss.

His intuition had detected the smell of danger.

However, Fumo Shaoyu had insisted on obtaining justice. Furthermore, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was also present. As such, it was unsuitable for him to say too much.

However, he was still filled with anxiety and felt that it was better that they try to leave before it was too late.

It was probably the best time for them to escape.

“Of course they do not have any good intentions.”

“After all they wanted to kill you,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Brother Shaoyu, you...”

Chu Feng was shocked upon hearing those words.

He had thought Fumo Shaoyu to be excessively stubborn, and only wanted to obtain justice without considering much of anything else. He had thought that Fumo Shaoyu had not realized how dangerous that place was at all.

However, after hearing what Fumo Shaoyu said, Chu Feng’s opinion of him was completely overturned.

Evidently, Fumo Shaoyu had also managed to see through certain things.

But if that was the case, Chu Feng felt even more confused.

Why would Fumo Shaoyu, after noticing that things were sketchy, still insist on staying?

“Big brother, what do you mean by that?”

“Why do you think that the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan wants to kill Chu Feng, and is determined to make him stay?”

The most confused person at that moment was Fumo Xin’er.

Her question was precisely what Chu Feng was wondering too.

“Lil’ sis, this is why you should’ve studied earnestly.”

“If you were like your big brother, if you had learned more from grandma, you wouldn’t be so confused,” Fumo Shaoyu did not answer directly. Instead he began to ridicule Fumo Xin’er.

“Big brother, stop making cutting remarks about me. Exactly what is going on? Tell me.”

“This matter concerns life and death,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“That so-called Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation is a formation from the Ancient Era.”

“It is something constructed by Heavenly Bloodline possessors from the Ancient Era.”

“It is used to enter closed-door training and make breakthroughs. However, it is not something that can be used at will.”

“A large amount of natural treasures are needed to activate it.”

“In simpler terms, one will have to spend an enormous amount of wealth in order to use it.”

“The lightning pearl we discovered is nowhere near enough to activate that Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.”

“The fact that the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan is able to activate that Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation means that they’ve exhausted an enormous amount of financial resources.”

“Since they’ve exhausted such an enormous amount of their financial resources, they will naturally not be so kind as to allow brother Chu Feng to enjoy the harvest of their efforts.”

“If my guess is correct, they want to make brother Chu Feng the Lightning Guide,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Lightning Guide? What’s that?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“The Lightning Tribulation is an extremely terrifying thing. This is especially true for those who train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. The Divine-level Lightning Tribulation that is triggered by that is even more terrifying.”

[1. Changed Divine Lightning Tribulation to Divine Lightning Affliction to differ the two types of trials.]

“The Lightning Tribulation triggered through such an ancient formation is even more terrifying. If that Zuoqiu Tiancheng is to face it by himself, he will likely fail to do so. It is very possible that he will even be killed by it.”

“The usage of a Lightning Guide is necessary to face the Lightning Tribulation on Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s behalf.”

“In other words, the Lightning Guide will endure the Lightning Tribulation in Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s place, but the benefits will all be obtained by Zuoqiu Tiancheng.”

“The end result would be that Zuoqiu Tiancheng achieves a breakthrough in cultivation whilst the Lightning Guide perishes.”

“Since ancient times, all Lightning Guides have been sacrifices.”

“However, not just anyone can be a Lightning Guide. Only an extremely talented Heavenly Bloodline possessor can become a Lightning Guide.”

“Back on that summit, brother Chu Feng sat on that Bloodline Testing Stone and triggered the nine colored lightning. That confirmed brother Chu Feng’s talent to be superior to that of Zuoqiu Tiancheng.”

“With that, brother Chu Feng became the most optimal Lightning Guide in the eyes of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan.”

“Perhaps because they are afraid that brother Chu Feng would refuse to become a stepping stone and rather be killed upon learning the truth. Instead they decided to treat us well, in order to deceive brother Chu Feng into entering the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.”

“If my guess is correct, they will prepare a suit of armor for both brother Chu Feng and Zuoqiu Tiancheng tomorrow.”

“On the surface, the two sets of armor will be identical.”

“However, they are actually enormously different.”

“Whoever wears the armor they prepare for brother Chu Feng shall become the Lightning Guide,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Damn it! This Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan is simply too treacherous, too cunning.”

“Big brother, we should flee right away,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“Flee?”

“Do you really think we would be able to escape?”

“Since the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan has planned for this, they will definitely not let us escape.”

“If my guess is correct, we are already being secretly monitored.”

“Besides, even if we are able to escape, we shouldn’t.”

“After all, brother Chu Feng has encountered the Divine Lightning Affliction.”

“This Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation will most likely be able to aid brother Chu Feng in breaching the Divine Lightning Affliction.”

“This is an extremely rare opportunity. We cannot afford to miss it,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Then what are we supposed to do? Are we perhaps to secretly exchange armors, and have Zuoqiu Tiancheng become the Lightning Guide and Chu Feng benefit from their preparations?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“That’s definitely not going to work. The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan will definitely be guarding that armor meticulously. It will be practically impossible to change armors under their watch,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Then what are we supposed to do?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“I have a way,” said Chu Feng.

“You have a way?” Fumo Xin’er felt extremely surprised.

“They will most likely set up a spirit formation on that armor.”

“I will prepare ahead of time, and set up a deciphering formation inside my body. With that, I’ll be able to remove the spirit formation on the armor. Even if I am to wear it, I will not become the Lightning Guide,” said Chu Feng.

“But you don’t know what sort of spirit formation they’ll be placing on the armor. How are you supposed to decipher it?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“Lil’ sis, you’re looking down on brother Chu Feng too much here.”

“He’s a Saint-cloak World Spiritist that has grasped the Dragon Transformation Sensation.”

“Since the Lightning Guide will be a sacrifice, the spirit formation they’ll be placing on the armor will most likely be some sort of lightning attracting formation.”

“Brother Chu Feng will definitely be able to handle it.”

“Besides, brother Chu Feng has an entire night to prepare.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As Fumo Shaoyu said those words, he deliberately glanced at Chu Feng. Confidence filled his eyes.

His guess was correct. To Chu Feng, that sort of spirit formation would not be difficult to decipher at all.

“Thank you for your warning, brother Shaoyu.”

“If it wasn’t for your warning, even if I had discovered that something was wrong with the armor tomorrow, I definitely wouldn’t be able to set up the spirit formation to remove the spirit formation on the armor in time,” said Chu Feng.

“We’re brothers. There’s no need to thank me.”

“However, without the Lightning Guide, you’ll have to face the Lightning Tribulation together with that Zuoqiu Tiancheng.”

“You’ll have to prepare yourself. Even though you’ve trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and have withstood multiple Lightning Tribulations, as the Lightning Tribulation this time around will be triggered with the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation, it will not be comparable with the Lightning Tribulations you’ve experienced in the past,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“I should be able to handle it.”

“That said, all of these will be trivial matters. The difficult problem will be how we’re supposed to escape afterwards.”

Chu Feng’s worry was not without reason.

If he were to steal Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s opportunity to make a breakthrough in the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan would definitely not spare them.

In fact, even if he didn’t steal Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s breakthrough opportunity they would still not spare them.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’ve said that in reverse.”

“Whether or not you’ll be able to make a breakthrough is the important matter. As for how to escape, it’s a trivial matter,” said Fumo Shaoyu.
