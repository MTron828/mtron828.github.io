“Buzz~~~”

At practically the moment when Chu Feng touched that gate, the two other gates disappeared.

Following that, the gate before Chu Feng opened.

In an instant, a boundless attractive force sucked Chu Feng into it.

At the moment when Chu Feng managed to stabilize his body, he was surprised to discover that he was currently in another palace hall.

Compared to the palace hall that he was in before, that palace hall was much smaller.

However, it was still extremely large, so large that it felt overly spacious and empty. The reason for that was because there was nothing in that palace hall at all, not even a single pillar.

That said, there was a platform in the center of the palace hall. That platform seemed to be made of gems. It was sparkling with light and very pretty.

That deep blue platform of gems had a circular shape. It was only a meter tall and ten meters in diameter.

However, being placed in a palace hall that seemed to be completely made of gold, the platform of gems that emitted a blue light appeared exceptionally beautiful.

It was gorgeous and dazzling, like a blue rose within a sea of peonies.

Most importantly, above the blue platform floated a fist-sized gem.

“That gem?”

Upon seeing that gem, Her Lady Queen’s expression immediately changed.

Compared to Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng was much more excited and emotional.

The reason for that was because that gem was no ordinary gem. That gem was emitting a very intense amount of power.

As for that power, it was source energy.

That was a gem containing source energy.

“Seems like I’ve chosen correctly.”

Chu Feng was wild with joy.

He had actually chosen the World Spirit gate with only a very simple purpose in mind. That is, he hoped to obtain something that would increase Her Lady Queen’s cultivation.

Chu Feng knew very well what sort of personality Her Lady Queen had. She was actually a very prideful individual. She was someone who feverishly pursued strength.

However, due to special causes, her cultivation was progressing extremely slowly right now, distinctly slower than the speed at which Chu Feng’s cultivation increased.

Although Her Lady Queen was not concerned with it, Chu Feng felt a great amount of guilt because of it.

If he hadn’t had Her Lady Queen with him, if he hadn’t had Eggy’s assistance, Chu Feng wouldn’t have been able to attain his current level of success.

In fact, Chu Feng would not have been able to even survive for so long.

Thus, what he wanted to do the most right now was repay and help Her Lady Queen.

And now, his cherished desire had finally come to fruition. He knew very well that gem would be able to help Her Lady Queen increase her cultivation.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right at the moment when Chu Feng was planning to approach the gem, a dazzling light suddenly appeared on the other side of the gem platform.

That dazzling light lasted only a single instant. At the moment when the light disappeared, a person appeared.

“I wouldn’t be this unlucky, right?”

At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart tightened.

He had heard from that girl Li Ming that one would generally never return empty-handed after entering the Sacred Heavenly Temple. However, there was one exception to this case.

That is, one could enter the Sacred Heavenly Temple at the same time as someone else.

Furthermore, both individuals could decide to choose the same treasure.

That said, something like that was a very rare occurrence.

However, at that moment, something that was practically impossible actually happened to Chu Feng.

“Fuck! You must be kidding, how could I be so unlucky to encounter this!”

At that moment, that other individual spoke with great displeasure. Evidently, that individual had noticed Chu Feng.

At that moment, Chu Feng also began to size up the individual before him. After all, that person would be his opponent.

That individual was a young man. Judging from his appearance, he should be around the same age as Chu Feng.

He had a very handsome appearance. Furthermore, it was not the pretty-boy sort of handsomeness. Rather, he had a very manly handsomeness.

Merely from his appearance, the young man would be capable of attracting countless women, making them want to throw themselves into his arms.

As for the outfit that young man wore, it was also very gorgeous. At a glance, one could tell that not only was his clothes precious, but each and every item on him was exceptionally precious as well.

However, in terms of what was the most precious, it would be a title plate on that young man’s waist. Not only was that title plate extremely exquisite, it was also a quality and refined work of art.

That title plate should be made out of some sort of treasure, an extremely rarely-seen and also extremely firm treasure.

Chu Feng felt that something like that should be meant to be used to forge weapons with.

To use a treasure like that to create a title plate was truly extravagant in Chu Feng’s eyes.

However, it was precisely because of that that Chu Feng was able to determine that the young man possessed an extraordinary origin.

Thus, Chu Feng remembered the two characters on the title plate, Xianhai. [1. Xianhai → Immortal Sea.]

At the same time that Chu Feng was sizing up that young man, that young man was also sizing up Chu Feng.

At the beginning, he had a very displeased expression. However, after sizing up Chu Feng, he revealed a relaxed expression.

Then, the corners of his mouth actually lifted into a smile.

“Alas, although I am unlucky, I am extremely fortunate to actually encounter trash,” That man said.

“Who are you talking about?” Chu Feng asked coldly.

“There’s only you and I here, who do you think I’m talking about?” That man said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng wanted to talk back.

However, right at that moment, that man’s expression changed. Then, a boundless oppressive might swept forth from within him.

“This aura!!!”

At that moment, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously. Even though that man possessed a similar age to Chu Feng, his aura was actually that of a True Immortal.

Furthermore, that aura was extremely powerful. Not only was he a True Immortal-level expert, but he was also not just a rank one True Immortal.

His power had surpassed the limits of Chu Feng’s perception.

Everything happened too quickly. Chu Feng simply did not even have the time to react, he did not even have the time to take out his Evil God Sword. That man’s powerful oppressive might had already completely engulfed Chu Feng.

“This...”

In that one instant, Chu Feng felt that he would undoubtedly be killed.

However, when that oppressive might swept through him, Chu Feng discovered that he was actually completely unscathed.

“Damn it, I forgot that cultivation is useless here,” At that moment, that man shook his head in disappointment. Then, he revealed a proud smile on his face and said to Chu Feng, “Boy, consider yourself lucky. Else... you wouldn’t even know how you died today.”

“What arrogance,” Chu Feng smiled coldly. He now looked to the man with a gaze filled with hostility.

That man had attacked him right after a verbal confrontation. Furthermore, he was planning to kill him earlier.

Fortunately, cultivation was useless here. Otherwise, Chu Feng would’ve already been killed by him. As such, how could Chu Feng have a favorable impression of someone like that?

“What, you’re unconvinced?” That man narrowed his brows.

“I am, what can you do about it?” Chu Feng revealed a provocative expression.

Although that man was stronger than him, Chu Feng was not afraid of him since cultivation was useless here.

“You!!!” Seeing such a reaction from Chu Feng, that man immediately revealed a displeased expression. Then, he asked, “Boy, do you dare tell me your name?”

“Uneducated trash, have your parents not taught you that you should give your name first when asking for another’s name?” Chu Feng mocked.

“What? You want to know my name? Could it be that you want to find me to settle things?” The man asked.

“Why can’t I?” Chu Feng said with a faint smile.

“Haha. It is not that I am looking down on you. However, if you are to know my name, I’m afraid that you will piss your pants in fear,” That man said with mocking laughter.

“If you don’t dare to tell me your name, you don’t have to,” Chu Feng said indifferently.

“Don’t dare? This Young Master doesn’t know those words. Boy, listen carefully. This Young Master is called Xianhai Shuoyi,” The man said.

“Xianhai Shuoyi?”

“You’re surnamed Xianhai?” Chu Feng had a surprised expression on his face. This was the first time he had heard such a surname.

“”You’ve actually never even heard of our Xianhai Clan?” That man was surprised. Evidently, he was slightly disappointed by Chu Feng not knowing about his name. Then, he curled his lips and said, “You truly are a country bumpkin.”

“No, no, no, since I’ve never heard of you before, it would only mean that your Xianhai Clan is not famous enough,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

“What a sharp tongue. Exactly who are you? Do you dare give your name?”

That man by the name of Xianhai Shuoyi was angered. Evidently, he cared greatly about his reputation. Chu Feng’s contemptuous behavior had enraged him.

“Perk up your ears and listen carefully. Your granddaddy here will not change his name standing, nor will he change his surname sitting. I am surnamed Chu and named Feng. I, your granddaddy, am named Chu Feng,” Chu Feng said.

“Impudent little thief, you dare address yourself as granddaddy before this Young Master?! You’re courting death!!!” Xianhai Shuoyi was completely enraged by Chu Feng, He shot forth a palm strike, and his overwhelming Immortal-level martial power moved toward Chu Feng oppressively like a giant tide.

His martial power was extremely fierce. In a blink of an eye, it completely swallowed Chu Feng. Like a group of wolves surrounding a little rabbit, it began to attack Chu Feng nonstop.

However, even though that attack seemed to be able to easily obliterate Chu Feng was wreaking havoc through Chu Feng’s surroundings, Chu Feng himself was completely unscathed.
