Chapter 1980 - Breaking Through The Killing Formation

“Killing formation, could this be the killing formation?”

At that moment, the crowd all started to panic. The reason for that was because killing intent was emerging from all around them, and that crimson net was flickering with crimson light.

At that moment, they were like turtles trapped in a jar with no way to escape.

“Little friend Chu Feng, it would seem that this old man has indeed wronged you. This old man will apologize to you here,” As the Snow Blade Mad Demon spoke, he planned to kneel to Chu Feng.

“Paa~~~”

However, before he could kneel, Chu Feng arrived before him like a phantom and helped him up, stopping him from kneeling.

“Senior Snow Blade, there’s no need for this. I said that I possessed another method,” Chu Feng said.

“Another method?” Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Snow Blade Mad Demon and the rest of the crowd present all revealed joyous expressions.

They were all able to sense the strength of that killing formation. If the crimson net were to engulf them, they would definitely be killed.

Originally, they all felt that they would lose their lives in this place, and were feeling remorseful for not having trusted Chu Feng. However, to their great surprise, Chu feng actually said that he possessed another method to save them. Furthermore, based on Chu Feng’s appearance, he did not appear to be joking around.

Thus, the crowd all felt as if they had seen the dawn of life when they had reached the place of absolute death. Everyone turned their gazes to Chu Feng. Contained within their gazes was anticipation. Over a dozen million people had placed their lives in Chu Feng’s hands.

In fact, as matters stood, they had no choice but to believe in Chu Feng.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

At that moment, Chu Feng’s hands began to change rapidly. Then, his palms clasped with one another and he shouted, “Open!”

“Buzz~~~”

In an instant, golden light filled the ground below the crowd’s feet. As the golden light shone, a golden defensive barrier rapidly formed and enveloped the crowd.

“This is great! We’re saved!!!”

At the moment when the golden defensive barrier appeared, the crowd was overjoyed. The reason for that was because when the golden defensive barrier appeared, the frightening aura that the killing formation was emitting disappeared in a flash. This meant that the defensive spirit formation was useful.

“Little friend Chu Feng, so you had already set up a spirit formation here,” Elder Huang Guan said. He was also a world spiritist. Even though he was not a very high level world spiritist, he was still capable of telling that Chu Feng’s spirit formation should have just been set up not long ago.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. You are our savior!” The crowd began to express their gratitude to Chu Feng.

“While this spirit formation of mine is capable of withstanding the killing formation temporarily, it is unable to resist it forever. Everyone, if we wish to escape this place alive, we must break through that killing formation,” Chu Feng said.

“Break through the killing formation?” Upon hearing those words, the extremely emotional crowd started to frown. That killing formation was very frightening. It was already unimaginable for Chu Feng to be able to stop it. Would they really be able to break through it?

At the moment when everyone started to express doubt, Chu Feng’s hands began to rapidly change again. Then, boundlessly majestic golden light began to appear outside the golden defensive barrier.

After the golden light appeared, it did not form another defensive barrier. Instead, it turned into many golden blades and began to slice and hack at the enormous crimson net.

“Clank, clank, clank, clank, clank~~~”

At that moment, Chu Feng’s spirit formation collided with the killing formation.

“Heavens! Little friend Chu Feng is amazing!” Seeing this scene, the crowd was overjoyed once again. They did not expect that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques would be so powerful, and that he was actually capable of cutting through the ancient killing formation.

That said, that killing formation was even stronger than Chu Feng had anticipated. Furthermore, as Chu Feng had exhausted a lot of his spirit power to set up the two grand spirit formations, his spirit power was currently somewhat insufficient.

If Chu Feng were to only rely on his own strength, he would only be able to control his spirit formation to contend against the killing formation, and would not be able to cut through the killing formation in a short period of time.

Feeling helpless, Chu Feng ended up opening his Cosmos Sack, and began to refine the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones inside. He was using the power of the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones to increase the strength of his own world spirit techniques so that they could contend against that killing formation.

Sure enough, after Chu Feng utilized the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, the strength of his spirit formation became more powerful. It started to destroy the enormous crimson net created by the killing formation. However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng was only able to cause slight damage, and not complete destruction.

At that moment, Chu Feng became very worried and anxious. He started to sweat profusely. In fact, even his lips started to turn blue. Even though he had utilized the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, the consumption of his world spirit power was still too enormous.

Chu Feng wanted to break through the killing formation as quickly as possible. The reason for that was because he felt that something must have happened on the Ancient Era’s Elves’ side for this killing formation to have activated.

This was a situation that Chu Feng did not wish to see. Thus, he must quickly take care of the problem over here and then go and help the Ancient Era’s Elves.

Merely, the current Chu Feng was truly unable to do what he wanted to do. If this were to continue, not only would he not be able to break through the killing formation, he himself might also end up dying here.

Seeing Chu Feng becoming this exhausted by controlling the spirit formation by himself, the bystanders began to feel major heartache.

At that moment, the gratefulness they had toward Chu Feng was something that only they understood. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Right at that moment, Wang Qiang asked, “Chu Feng, t, th, this is n, not going to, to work. Can you cr, create an, another for, formation core so th, that I can hel, hel, help you?”

“Unless they are a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, no one will be able to help me,” Chu Feng said.

“Hehehe...” Wang Qiang laughed complacently. He flipped his palm, and a strand of golden world spirit energy hovered over it like a little snake.

Seeing Wang Qiang’s world spirit power, not only Chu Feng, everyone else present was shocked. What Wang Qiang had revealed was no ordinary world spirit power. Instead, it was Dragon Mark Royal-level world spirit power.

Wang Qiang was actually also a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Haha, great,” Chu Feng was overjoyed upon discovering that Wang Qiang was also a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. The reason for that was because he really did need the help of another Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist at that moment.

Thus, Chu Feng created another formation core beside him. Then he said to Wang Qiang, “Just pour your world spirit power into it. You will be able to assist me that way.”

“N, no, no pro, problem,” As Wang Qiang spoke, he jumped into that spirit formation core and began to pour his world spirit power into it.

When Wang Qiang’s world spirit power entered the formation’s core, Chu Feng’s heart was startled.

At that moment, he felt an enormous power pushing him from behind like a large, vigorous hand.

He knew that sensation was caused by Wang Qiang. Wang Qiang’s world spirit power was actually that powerful. His world spirit power was so powerful that it was on par with his own.

With Wang Qiang’s assistance, Chu Feng was certain that he’d be able to break through the killing formation.

Sure enough, after Wang Qiang began to help Chu Feng, the strength of Chu Feng’s spirit formation increased enormously in an instant. The golden blades which Chu Feng’s spirit formation had created became even more ferocious. They began to shatter the killing formation in a large-scale manner. In the end, they completely destroyed the enormous crimson net.

Chu Feng and Wang Qiang successfully broke through the killing formation.

“Success?”

When the crowd saw the enormous crimson net being sliced apart by the golden blades, they did not dare to believe this to be real.

After all, that was a Moonlight Maze’s killing formation. Chu Feng had really managed to break through it, he had really managed to break through a killing formation in the Moonlight Maze?

Chu Feng’s world spirit technique was really that powerful?
