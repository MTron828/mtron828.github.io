Chapter 5871: Ambition

Jie Tianran’s body twitched, and a gentle surge of energy flowed out and enveloped him. His injuries began to swiftly recover.

“Do we have to resort to this energy to recuperate?” Jie Tianran had been so weak that he couldn’t even talk, but even so, he was doubtful about using this energy to recover.

He knew what this energy was, and he had no doubt it would allow him to swiftly heal up. However, he thought that it was a waste to use it here, and he would rather grit his teeth and endure the injury.

“There’s still some energy remaining in the Spiritist King Mirror. You can try using a few more Spiritist King Detection Talismans before its energy fully fades—you might still have a chance. You have to return to the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city right now,” the voice inside Jie Tianran said.

“Didn’t you say that it’s impossible to stack the Spiritist King Detection Talismans?” Jie Tianran asked as he got up and sat down with crossed legs.

“It’s only normal for me to withhold my hand. Jie Tianran, you should get it too,” the voice inside his body replied sheepishly.

“I understand. Just don’t hold back when it counts,” Jie Tianran replied.

“Jie Tianran, that grandson of yours is indeed talented. You pale far in comparison to him,” the voice inside his body said mockingly.

Jie Tianran didn’t lose his temper. Instead, he formed a hand seal and channeled the energy inside him to hasten his recovery. “You and I had to join forces to force it to a draw. I might be lacking compared to him, but the same goes for you too.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Cough cough. That brat is indeed formidable in terms of talent.”

“He merely inherited Ranqing’s talent, but Ranqing’s talent comes from me. If not for me, he wouldn’t have existed in the first place.”

“You’re right. Actually, is there a need for you to go this far when you’re a family? You could have brought him into Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to aid you—Chu Feng would have been much more useful than Jie Tian. He’s still your grandson, after all. Do you intend to strip him of his bloodline for your use?” the voice inside Jie Tianran’s body said.

Disdain appeared on Jie Tianran’s composed face. “My plan was impeccable. If not for the sudden appearance of his father, Ranqing wouldn’t have turned against me. The more talented that bastard is, the more I hate him. If Ranqing married Mubai, the child between them would have been a hundred times better than Chu Feng! His birth defies heaven’s will, and his talent doesn’t belong to him! Everything he has comes from me, and I’m just claiming what’s mine.”

“You’re too much of a perfectionist. Chu Feng’s father is not a normal person either. He might not pale in comparison to Jie Mubai. If you had taken a step back and accepted the two of them, your daughter would have still been obedient to you. You would have been one happy family. Things wouldn’t have reached the current state. You probably don’t feel good about this, right?” the voice said.

“There’s nothing to feel bad about. Heaven’s will can’t be defied. They are the ones who went against heaven’s will. I have done nothing wrong,” Jie Tianran replied furiously.

“How can you be certain that a child born between your daughter and Jie Mubai would be far stronger than Chu Feng?” the voice asked.

“What do you mean by that? You’re the one who made me do that prophecy! Why are you wavering now that I believe in the prophecy?” Jie Tianran narrowed his eyes in rage.

“What are you saying? I would never waver. I’m just wondering if you regret your decision. There’s no changing what has happened. Perhaps, the way forward is to put down your obsession and make reconciliations. All things aside, don’t you think that Chu Feng is worth nurturing?” the voice asked.

“Say no more. I have already made up my mind. Chu Feng is a bastard who should have never been born. I’ll take everything from him,” Jie Tianran replied.

“It might still be possible to make reconciliations if you turn back now. There’ll be no room for regret if you kill Chu Feng,” the voice said.

“It’s too late for that. I won’t turn back.”

“You’re determined to kill Chu Feng?”

“He has to die.”

“Good. I haven’t chosen the wrong person.” The voice suddenly changed his tune, as if everything he had said before was just to test Jie Tianran.

“It has been so many years, but you still don’t understand me? I’ll never look back once I have made up my mind,” Jie Tianran replied.

“Indeed. I chose you because of your determination. Those who wish to achieve great things must have such a quality. Talent is not everything. What’s more important is ambition and the tenacity to do whatever it takes to reach one’s goal. Your talent is already enough, and you have the tenacity that the others lack.

“Actually, it doesn’t matter at all. Your daughter turning against you is not that important. Whether your destined grandson is born is not important either. The truth is that you don’t have to rely on others at all. You only nurtured them to assist you, but ultimately, the most important one of all is yourself. All you have to do is to become the strongest world spiritist in the world.

“I’m glad to see that your determination has not wavered at all,” the voice said.

“Put your mind at ease. My faith has never wavered. I’ll push the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to unprecedented heights and stand above the entire world. Only I can achieve that.” Jie Tianran opened his eyes, revealing a terrifying gaze.

“Ki ki ki!” The voice inside Jie Tianran let out an eerie but satisfied cackle. “Good! I didn’t choose the wrong person this time. You aren’t someone who is tied down by emotions. With my support, you’ll overtake Qin Jiu and become the World Spiritist Emperor of the current era!”

However, Jie Tianran shook his head. “I don’t plan on walking down the same path others did. My ambition is not to become the World Spiritist Emperor. Rather, I want to become the World Spiritist God!”
