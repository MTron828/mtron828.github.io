Chapter 5079: Precious Quality

Before stepping into the contract formation, the Asura King even clasped his fist and bowed to Chu Feng.

“I am Kui Ting, a world spirit from the Asura Spirit World. I’m willing to establish a contract with Lord Chu Feng today.”

As he said those words, the black gaseous flames around him furious blazed and surged into the contract formation. He raised his palm and placed it on God’s Contract.

Weng!

A flow of energy induced similar auras in Chu Feng, the Asura King, and God’s Contract.

“Milord!”

The Asura Evil Spirits looked conflicted by the situation. They knew how proud the Asura King was, and they thought that he would be the last one amongst them to bow to Chu Feng. Yet, the Asura King chose to establish a contract with Chu Feng while the rest of them were still hesitating.

The contract was swiftly sealed, and the Asura King’s appearance began to change. From a terrifying evil spirit, he reverted to the form of a human. He didn’t look as sinister as before, but the aura he was giving off was much more domineering.

He was an Asura World Spirit, after all. They were known to be darker than even the world spirits of the Demon Spirit World. Even if his appearance didn’t look as terrifying, the aura he emanated was still intimidating.

However, Chu Feng couldn’t help but feel a sliver of guilt toward the Asura King. The moment God’s Contract was sealed, he could sense the Asura King’s cultivation plummeting from rank seven Half-God level to rank four Half-God level.

Needless to say, the cause of it was the contract.

“Just as I’ve guessed.”

However, the Asura King wasn’t disappointed by the fall in his cultivation at all. On the contrary, he revealed a light smile that showed that he wasn’t too bothered by it. He turned around and faced the subordinates that had followed him for tens of thousands of years now.

“Everyone, I might have established a contract with Lord Chu Feng, but this decision is mine and mine alone. You’re no longer related to me, and I’m not your king anymore. I’m just a world spirit of Lord Chu Feng.

“The choice is up to you whether you wish to follow Lord Chu Feng or not. There’s no need for you to consider my decision.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After saying those words, the Asura King walked up to Lord Yunliang.

“Yunliang, I apologize for all the hurt I have caused you.”

Astonishingly, the Asura King actually bowed deeply to Yunliang. This sight shocked all of the Asura Evil Spirits.

Putting aside the fact that Yunliang did do wrong by going against the Asura King’s orders, just the lofty standing of the Asura King itself made it inappropriate for him to display such formality to Yunliang.

“Milord, please don’t say that. You had the welfare of our clan at heart too. It’s just that our stances differed from each other. I have done wrong by colluding with outsiders to kidnap the princess too. I am deeply grateful that you have chosen to spare me, or else I wouldn’t have had a chance to meet Lord Chu Feng

“I’ll remember your grace for my entire life,” Lord Yunliang spoke earnestly from his heart.

He did begrudge the Asura King and the other Asura Evil Spirits for casting away their loyalty for Lord Massacre, but he didn’t blame the Asura King for crippling his cultivation and the torture he was put through.

“Let bygones be bygones. Come, let’s go and free our imprisoned clan members. I ought to apologize to them in person.”

With those words, the Asura King left together with Lord Yunliang, leaving behind just Chu Feng, Yaoyao, and the hesitant Asura Evil Spirits.

Under normal circumstances, Chu Feng should have started cowering once his most fervent supporters, the Asura King and Yunliang, left the area, but his gaze remained as firm as before.

“I have already said all that I wish to say. You should have also seen for yourself that your cultivation will regress if you choose to establish contact with me. However, I promise you that my weakness will not last for long. There will be a day where I grow to become the strongest cultivator in this vast world of cultivation. You may doubt my claim, but I can tell you that that has been my goal all along,” Chu Feng said.

“Lord Chu Feng, can you tell us the reason why you wish to become the strongest cultivator? Do you wish to rule over the world of cultivation?” the Asura Evil Spirit named Xiang Ji asked.

Chu Feng chuckled upon hearing the question.

“Lord Xiang Ji, I hope that you wouldn’t laugh at me for saying this, but I don’t have such ambitions.”

“This…”

The Asura Evil Spirits were taken aback by the unexpected answer. Even Yaoyao also stared at Chu Feng with widened eyes. Those who sought to become the strongest usually had ambitions to conquer the world and make everyone submit to them, but Chu Feng had no such goal in mind?

None of them could figure out what Chu Feng was thinking.

“I believe that the greatest thing in this world is not the power to destroy everything or make everyone worship you. Rather, it’s the earnest sentiments that exist between people. That’s what makes me feel the warmth of the world.

“I could rule the world if I have boundless power, but if there’s not a single person in the world who can make me waver, the vast world would just become utterly monotonous and boring to me.

“Of course, I understand that having people whom I care about can make me weak. However, I have been protected by people who care about me, and I wish to protect my friends and family too.

“It’s just that this world is cruel… Even if we don’t provoke others, trouble will still fall upon us. There could be people who want to kill us just by walking on the road. Even if we coop ourselves up, a single ripple from the fight between powerful experts could take our life.

“How can I protect anyone if I am not strong enough? That’s why I want to cultivate and become stronger than anyone else. I know that I won’t be able to definitely protect everyone whom I care for as long as there’s a person stronger than me. That’s the reason why I wish to become the strongest in the world,” Chu Feng said.

The Asura Evil Spirits fell silent. They had heard from many others the reason why they wished to become strong, and honestly speaking, Chu Feng’s answer was hardly special at all. However, his words carried sincerity in them that made them believe that it was not just empty talk.

They were reminded of the fact that Chu Feng was taking a huge risk by returning to the Asura Graveyard, but he did it in order to save his master, elders, and friends. This proved that Chu Feng possessed a precious quality that cultivators in the world direly lacked.

“We didn’t know each other before today, and I won’t bother trying to buddy up with you now. However, if you choose to follow me, you’ll be my family members from this day onward. I’ll need your protection now, but a day will come where I’ll be the one protecting you.

“We’ll advance together on the road to becoming stronger. If there’s an opportunity for you to raise your cultivation, I’ll not miss it even if it comes with great risks. I promise that as long as I don’t die, I’ll make sure that every single one of you regain your cultivation within a hundred years and even surpass your previous limit!” Chu Feng declared grandly.

“A hundred years?”

The Asura Evil Spirits glanced at one another.

It had taken them tens of thousands of years to advance their cultivation to its current stage, so it was hard to believe that Chu Feng would be able to aid them to regain their cultivation within a hundred years.

It might be because Chu Feng was the person chosen by the Heavenly Lord of Massacre or some other reason unbeknownst to them at the moment, but they didn’t think that Chu Feng was bragging. They felt that he was credible.

“Lord Chu Feng, I, Xiang Ji, am willing to establish a contract with you and serve you!”

Xiang Ji bowed deeply to Chu Feng before making his way to the contract formation to establish a contract with him.

Furious roars echoed right after, but if one were to listen closely, it was the voices of several million Asura Evil Spirits speaking simultaneously.

“Lord Chu Feng, I am willing to serve you!”

“Lord Chu Feng, I am willing to fight alongside you!”

“Lord Chu Feng, I’ll obey your orders!”

…

…

With each shout, an Asura Evil Spirit would step forward to establish a contract with Chu Feng. Within moments, nearly a million Asura Evil Spirits had already contracted with him, and the number was still increasing…
