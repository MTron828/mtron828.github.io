Chapter 4953: Rank Nine Dragon Transformation Sensation

“Is that so? You won’t hand over the treasure even if it spells the death of your Zhuge Clan?” the blue-cloaked woman asked with narrowed eyes.

Boom!

Great spirit power gushed out from the blue-cloaked woman’s body. It swiftly filled up the sky, emanating an intimidating aura that made others shudder. It was spirit power comparable to the might of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator.

She was a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist.&nbsp;

“Rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation; she’s just a step away from reaching God-cloak. It’s no wonder why she’s so confident.”

Even Shengguang Buyu’s breathing hastened upon sensing the blue-cloaked woman’s aura. Despite being enemies, he felt a sliver of respect for her. He knew just how difficult it was to reach rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hmph!”

Faced with the blue-cloaked woman’s spirit power, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief harrumphed coldly. He formed a series of hand seals that made his hands light up. Then, he clasped his hands together.

Boom!

The earth rattled, and an aquamarine pillar gushed into the sky reminiscent of a volcano before swiftly rushing into the body of the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief. It imbued the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief in aquamarine light covered in formation runes.&nbsp;

The formation runes were beautiful, covering him like armor.&nbsp;

At the same time, his fighting prowess rose to the level equivalent to a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator.&nbsp;

The eyes of Chu Feng and the others lit up at this sight. They knew that the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief had finally evoked the power of the defensive formation.

“The defensive formation is actually that formidable?”

Shengguang Baimei felt a sliver of fear. It was fortunate that he had refrained from making a move on the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief earlier on, or else he would have been the one to suffer. At the very least, he was certain that he wouldn’t be able to defeat the buffed Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief.&nbsp;

“This must be the defensive formation set up by Zhuge Guangyao. Not bad. It looks like the treasure is indeed something extraordinary.”

However, the blue-cloaked woman showed no fear at all. If anything, she only got even more excited.&nbsp;

“Our Zhuge Clan has treated you with respect ever since you stepped in here. Even when you harmed our clan members, we still upheld our civility. We’re willing to return Situ Qi’s items to you, but if you wish to humiliate a hero of your Zhuge Clan, Lord Zhuge Guangyao, I’m afraid that we can’t let you have your way.”

After saying those words, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief turned to look at the elders beside him.

“Activate the formation!”

The elders quickly formed a series of hand seals. They were channeling their spirit energy to construct a formation.

“Activate!”

“Activate!!”

“Activate!!!”

Shouts of ‘activate’ could be heard all over the Zhuge Clan. They were setting up a formation within their body. Outsiders might not be able to see what was really happening, but without a doubt, the eventual formation they constructed was bound to be formidable.

The Zhuge Clan had finally bared its fangs!

This made Chu Feng see them in a different light.

Despite casting away their dignity earlier to tolerate everything from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, they didn’t allow the latter to insult their ancestors. It was not that they didn’t have a temper; they only chose to hold it in to resolve things amicably.&nbsp;

However, if one dared to touch their reverse scale, they wouldn’t hesitate to resort to violence.

And Zhuge Guangyao was their reverse scale.

“Things are getting interesting,” Shengguang Baimei murmured in excitement.

This matter had nothing to do with him, but he was still excited to witness this fight.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan was a formidable foe, but things were not hopeless for the desperate Zhuge Clan either. It was bound to be a thrilling fight between the two.&nbsp;

“Despite all your talks about respect, you have been gathering your men in preparation to fend against us right from the start. Hypocrites. Did you think that I didn’t notice your movements?” the blue-cloaked woman scoffed.

“Our Zhuge Clan has no wish to cross hands with you, but we have no choice if you insist on cornering us. We can’t allow others to sully the name of our ancestors.”

As he said those words, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief released the oppressive might of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator toward the blue-cloaked woman.&nbsp;

The blue-cloaked woman quickly gathered her spirit power to fend against the oppressive might. She managed to deflect it, but those standing behind her were still forced to take a step back.&nbsp;

For the first time, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief was warning them.

He was telling them that the Zhuge Clan was no pushover.&nbsp;

However, the blue-cloaked woman didn’t lose her nerves after experiencing the power of the defensive formation. Instead, her smile deepened.

“That defensive formation of yours is quite interesting. I guess Zhuge Guangyao wasn’t all talk. Now I’m more curious than ever to know what the treasure he has left behind is. Stop being stubborn and hand over Zhuge Guangyao’s treasure!” the blue-cloaked woman said.

“Even at the cost of our lives, we’ll guard our ancestors’ honor. If you insist on proceeding ahead, our Zhuge Clan will have no choice but to drop all civility,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said.&nbsp;

“You’re willing to die for your values? It looks like you have some spunk. Very well then. You can all die now!”&nbsp;

Murderous intent blazed in the eyes of the blue-cloaked woman as she waved her sleeves grandly.&nbsp;

Boom!

A tremendous gush of spirit power morphed into countless wind blades and flew toward those from the Zhuge Clan.&nbsp;

Grar!

In response, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief quickly drew an Exalted Armament and swung his sword against the wind blades. A great martial power arc that spanned over ten thousand meters long swept across the air.&nbsp;

It was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

Boom!

The arc of martial power clashed against the wind blades made out of spirit power, creating a huge shockwave that rattled the earth. Even in the palace, Chu Feng was finding it difficult to maintain his balance.

After all, this was a fight between two individuals who had reached the pinnacle of Martial Exalted level.

“How laughable. A world spiritist clan is actually using the means of a cultivator to fight against us. You’ve truly sullied the honor of all world spiritists!” the blue-cloaked woman mocked.

She swiftly formed yet another series of hand seals and launched yet another attack. This time around, multiple white dragons spawned in front of her.&nbsp;

It was the offensive formation that Situ Gouyue had constructed earlier on, but the blue-cloaked woman was able to construct it nearly instantaneously with just a wave of her hand, and the prowess far surpassed that of Situ Gouyue too.

This was the prowess of a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation expert.&nbsp;
