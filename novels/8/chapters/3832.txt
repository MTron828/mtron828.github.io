Chapter 3832 - Responsibility

“In that case, the current Reincarnation Upper Realm is truly not peaceful.”

“I hope that Grandmaster Tang Chen will be able to return safely.” Chu Feng sighed.

“Brother Chu Feng, you don’t have to worry about that. With my master’s ability, even those Ancient Era’s organisms will not be able to threaten him.”

“However, if it’s us, we wouldn’t be able to handle them. Thus... brother Chu Feng, if you don’t have any other business, it’s best to stay in the Seven Suns Mountain Range for the time being.”

“My master’s Seven Suns Mountain Range is the safest place in the entire Reincarnation Upper Realm,” said Yuan Shu.

“Brother Yuan Shu, according to you, if the Ancient Era’s organisms are to truly emerge from their nest in full strength, wouldn’t the people of the Reincarnation Upper Realm be met with a disaster?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s hard to say. If the Ancient Era’s organisms truly possess hostile intentions, a portion of the people will indeed suffer a calamity," said Yuan Shu.

“In that case, why aren’t you announcing this matter to the people of the Reincarnation Upper Realm so that they can come to the Seven Suns Mountain Range to evade the danger?” asked Chu Feng.

“They will not necessarily believe this sort of thing even if I announced it. Even if there are people that believe it, it will definitely cause panic.”

“There are a lot of people in the Reincarnation Upper Realm. No matter how large my Seven Suns Mountain Range might be, it will not be able to accommodate all of them.”

“Besides, not even my master is able to confirm if this matter is true. If I am to spread word of this matter and the Ancient Era’s organisms do not emerge from their nest, or if they do not cause casualties after emerging, then wouldn’t I... become a rumor spreader?”

“That said, brother Chu Feng, none of these are actually important.”

“Most importantly, my master did not allow me to tell others about this.”

“My master has taught me one thing since my youth -- if I am to witness something with my own eyes, I can root out the strong to help the weak. However, no matter how strong my cultivation might be, I must not try to protect the entire world.”

“Fate is unfathomable. Whether someone lives or dies is their fate. As we are not gods, how are we qualified to change the fate of others?”

As Yuan Shu said those words, the gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng became profound.

Chu Feng felt what Yuan Shu had said to be rather reasonable.

Everyone had their own opinion.

Grandmaster Tang Chen had the ability to protect the Reincarnation Upper Realm. However, he did not have a responsibility to do so.

If he wanted to protect the Reincarnation Upper Realm, he could do so. If he didn’t want to, he didn’t have to. No one could determine if his action was right or wrong. At the very least, they did not possess the authority to pass judgement on him.

Suddenly, Yuan Shu said to Chu Feng with a smile on his face, “Well then, let’s not talk about these things anymore. Brother Chu Feng, you seemed to already know that Red-dress Holy Sect’s Yin Zhuanghong?”

“I indeed already knew her. Oh, that’s right. Brother Yuan Shu, why did she seek you out?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was very curious as to why Yin Zhuanghong wanted to meet Yuan Shu so much.

“I don’t know.” Yuan Shu shook his head.

“You don’t know?” Chu Feng felt that something was amiss upon hearing those words. He hurriedly asked, “Did she not mention the reason why she wanted to meet you?”

“How is she supposed to tell me her reason for wanting to meet me without seeing me?” Yuan Shu said with a beaming smile.

“Brother Yuan Shu, could it be... even after passing through that spirit formation gate, one still cannot meet you?” asked Chu Feng.

“The true test lies in one’s character. Evidently, in terms of character, only brother Chu Feng passed the test. Thus, didn’t you manage to see me?” said Yuan Shu with a smile.

“Then, where’s Yin Zhuanghong now?” asked Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, for you to be so concerned with her well-being, could you be fond of that girl?” Yuan Shu asked with a smile.

“Being fond of her would be out of the question. We just have a friendly relationship; she can be considered to be my friend.”

“It is like brother Yuan Shu said, I can disregard the safety of others. However, I can’t possibly disregard my friends, no? If I were someone like that, I likely wouldn’t have been able to pass brother Yuan Shu’s test either," said Chu Feng.

“Mn, what you say is correct.”

“Rest assured, there is a spirit formation inside that spirit formation gate. Although that girl is trapped in the spirit formation, she is most definitely not in fatal danger. The spirit formation is merely to teach her a slight lesson.”

“That said, I will take brother Chu Feng into consideration and let her out ahead of time," as Yuan Shu spoke, he took out a compass.

Facing the compass toward the sky, Yuan Shu began to operate it.

That compass was the formation core. Through the compass, Chu Feng was able to see what Yin Zhuanghong’s current situation was like.

She was trapped in a space of primal chaos. Spirit formations filled that place. Because of that, she was trapped.

However, it was as Yuan Shu had said, she was merely trapped, and did not sustain any injuries.

Suddenly, a ray of light appeared from the sky and enveloped Yin Zhuanghong.

Then, Yin Zhuanghong rushed out of the sky following that light and left the chaotic space.

Chu Feng knew that all of this was Yuan Shu’s doing.

Seeing the change from the compass, Chu Feng suspected that Yin Zhuanghong had already left the grand formation and had been returned to the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

“Brother Chu Feng, I have brought her out of the spirit formation. Your mind is set at ease now, no?” Yuan Shu smiled and patted Chu Feng’s shoulder as he said those words. Then, he sat down in his chair. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Brother Yuan Shu, with how much that girl wanted to see you, perhaps she has some sort of important matter. Are you really not planning to see her?” asked Chu Feng.

Yuan Shu acted as if he did not hear Chu Feng’s words. He picked up his wine cup on the table and said to Chu Feng, “Brother Chu Feng, come, let’s drink.”

Seeing that, Chu Feng knew that it wasn’t that Yuan Shu did not hear him. Instead, he did not wish to meet Yin Zhuanghong.

Thus, Chu Feng did not linger on the topic and also raised his wine cup. “Cheers.”
