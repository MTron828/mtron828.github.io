Chapter 5334: Rampaging Milady Queen

Boom!𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The black gaseous flames morphed into countless sharp claws that swiped at the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s army and Yuan Jiang.

“Get behind me!” the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master ordered.

He put his hands together and channeled his martial power.

Boom!

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master released a burst of grayish-black aura that expanded outward to devour Eggy’s claws of black gaseous flames. Similarly, Yuan Jiang tossed out a golden shield that swiftly expanded into a massive wall that split the world into two. 

Together, the destructive grayish-black aura and the nigh-indestructible golden shield covered both offense and defense. Eggy looked to be in a disadvantageous position. 

Yet, when the sharp claws of black gaseous flames finally landed, the grayish-black aura was devoured without putting up much of a fight, whereas the golden shield shattered like fragile glass. All they managed to do was barely slow down the black gaseous flames. 

“What the hell is that monster?”

Seeing that he was unable to stop the black gaseous flames, the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master channeled his grayish-black aura to bring Yuan Jiang and his army as far away as possible. 

Meanwhile, Yuan Jiang threw out more golden shields, which at least proved to be effective in slowing down Eggy’s attack. 

The Ancient Realm’s chief and Bai Yunqing couldn’t believe what they were seeing. 

In particular, Bai Yunqing knew that Eggy was only at rank one Half-God level, but somehow, Eggy had managed to claim the upper hand in this battle, judging from how the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master and the others were fleeing in a fluster. He couldn’t understand how Eggy was able to exert such tremendous strength.

That was the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master they were talking about! It would be a stretch to say that he was one of the strongest people in the world of cultivation, but he definitely wasn’t far from that tier.

Even the overlords of a galaxy would have to think twice before offending him.

Yuan Jiang also emanated an extremely powerful aura that didn’t pale in comparison to the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master. 

Yet, such existences were fleeing from a rank one Half-God level world spirit. Had he not witnessed it with his own eyes, he would have never believed that something this ridiculous could have happened. 

“No, that’s not right.” 

Bai Yunqing quickly realized that something was amiss. Even though Eggy’s killing intent was still raging like a demonic god, blood had started seeping from her lips. 

“She’s putting her life on the line.”

Even so, it was still ridiculous how Eggy was able to exert such strength even if she was putting her life on the line. This was a feat that not even someone as monstrously talented as Chu Feng was capable of!

Roar!

A humongous figure that could have been either a god or a demon suddenly manifested behind Eggy, and it immediately provided a surge of strength. With this additional boost, her sharp claws of black gaseous flames quickly caught up with the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s army. 

The claws instantaneously tore through the army of hundreds of millions, including Yuan Jiang and the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master.  

Gah!!

Tragic cries filled the air. Those who had been slashed by the sharp claws struggled in agony. Black gaseous flames were seeping out of their noses, eyes, mouths, ears, and soon, even their skin. Before long, their bodies began to break down.

“What kind of monster is that?!”

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master tried his best to shield Zhou Dong, but it was hard to do so when he was barely standing his ground. He had already come to a realization that he could very well lose his life here. Not just him, but the entire Bluemoon Sacred Palace would die to the sharp claws of the demon before them too. 

Just as he thought that it was all over, the black claws suddenly vanished. The terrifying black gaseous flames also vanished from all of their bodies. There were casualties, but most of them were still alive, albeit incapacitated. 

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master and its top experts, including Yuan Jiang, were safe and sound. They couldn’t help but wonder why the slaughter had suddenly stalled to a halt.

However, when they raised their heads and saw Eggy’s body plummeting from the sky, they immediately understood what had happened. After crashing into the ground, Eggy tried her best to return to her feet, but she didn’t even have the strength for that anymore. 

She was still emanating black gaseous flames, but the terrifying pressure they commanded earlier was nowhere to be seen. 

“Demoness, I’ll kill you!” Yuan Jiang roared. 

He was planning to get rid of Eggy while she was weakened, but before he could make a move, the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master stopped him.

“She’s already at her limit. Her earlier means were powerful, but that’s probably strength that she traded her life for. She must be incredibly talented to be able to attain such strength despite her weak cultivation. Rather than kill her, why don’t we slowly watch her wither away instead? After all, it’s rare for us to be able to see prodigies of this caliber die,” the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master mocked.

Yuan Jiang carefully assessed Eggy. A moment later, he heaved a sigh of relief upon confirming that Eggy no longer posed a threat to them. At the same time, he managed to make out Eggy’s true identity.

“An Asura World Spirit? You must belong to Chu Feng. To think that you’re able to open the world spirit gate by yourself without your master’s help. I have never seen a world spirit as scary as you. I should give Chu Feng some credit for taming you. You would have been a handful to deal with in the future, but it’s unfortunate that you met us,” Yuan Jiang remarked with a gleeful smile.

He felt triumphant to be able to witness two incredibly talented prodigies dying before him. 

Chu Feng’s talent had been acknowledged by the Ancestral Idol, whereas his world spirit had displayed tremendous power that could have taken down the entire Bluemoon Sacred Palace if she had lasted a moment longer. 

Yuan Jiang knew that Chu Feng and his world spirit would eventually reach a height beyond their imagination if given sufficient time, but he actually managed to kill them before they could fully mature. This was something he could brag about for his entire life. 

The others from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace had realized that as well, and they were feeling gleeful about it. Everyone looked at Eggy and waited for her life to be snuffed out. Some of them even began mocking her.

“Hey, demoness, where did your gusto go? I was still wondering how formidable you are, but it turns out that you’re nothing much at all.”

“Is that fellow your lover? Is that why you’re going so far for him?”

All kinds of insults floated in the air, but Eggy didn’t even have the strength to answer.

However, someone rebuked the Bluemoon Sacred Palace for their shamelessness in her place.

“Shut up, you bunch of trash. Bluemoon Sacred Palace? My ass! All I see is a bunch of losers who got frightened by this young miss earlier. Don’t you think that it’s pathetic for you to bark so loudly now after peeing your pants earlier? Even I feel embarrassed for you!”

It was Bai Yunqing. He couldn’t stand the arrogance displayed by the Bluemoon Sacred Palace anymore and began berating them.

“Young hero Bai Yunqing is right! The Bluemoon Sacred Palace prides itself on being a demonic sect, but you got all scared by that young miss earlier. I guess despite all the big talk, demonic sects like you are just cowards who oppress the weak but fear the strong,” the Ancient Realm’s chief chirped in. 

Laughter echoed in the air. They were from the Ancient Realm’s elders. 

They knew that they would be able to live as long as they pledged their allegiance to Yuan Jiang; that was also the reason the latter had spared them till now. However, their loyalty lay with the Ancient Realm. There was no way they could submit to a traitor. 

All of them were already prepared to lose their lives here. Since that was the case, there was no need for them to fear anything at all. Even at the risk of losing their lives, they weren’t going to allow the Bluemoon Sacred Palace to relish in their victory.
