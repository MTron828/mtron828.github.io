Chapter 4322: The Future of the Dragon Clan

The Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground was located in the midst of a mountain range, like a massive dragon crouching on the lands.

The Dragon Vein Source was located in the middle of a desert. The desert was filled with powerful wind currents that swept up a deadly sandstorm in the region.

The deadly sandstorm should have made it impossible for anything else to exist within the desert. Even if something used to exist there, it would have long been battered down by the sandstorm.

Yet, somehow, there was a tall and lofty mountain at the very heart of the desert.

The mountain looked like a pile of dirt stacked up together, but without a doubt, it was far harder than it looked. Despite facing the constant assault of the pattering sandstorm, it still remained completely unharmed.

The mountain was shaped like a massive bone plunged vertically in the midst of the desert, making it quite a baffling sight. On top of that, there was light glowing at the peak of this unique-looking mountain, giving it a mystical touch.

And this place was what the Dragon Clan called the Dragon Vein Source.

It was rumored that the Dragon Clan was built here due to the Dragon Vein Source being located here, and if this land could be opened, the clan members of the Dragon Clan would enjoy tremendous growth in their strength.

The only problem was that opening up this land was no easy feat.

At this very moment, Chu Feng was in the midst of the desert, standing right before the mountain. Despite its towering size, he was still able to analyze it with his Heaven’s Eyes.

Due to the limitations of his strength, he wasn’t able to tell how the bone-shaped mountain could be opened, but he could still sense that there was something extraordinary within it.

“It won’t be difficult to open it up,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly spoke up.

As soon as he said those words, the crowd from the Dragon Clan immediately widened their eyes in a mixture of astonishment and delight.

“Grandmaster, are your words for real?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

He could hardly conceal the joy in his voice.

Did the Ox-nosed Old Daoist really possess the ability to open this place when even the experts of the Dragon Clan were utterly helpless before it?

If he really could do so, the Dragon Clan could be brought to an even greater height than before!

“It’s not a problem at all. Even though it’ll be troublesome and possibly dangerous too, it’s still within this old man’s means,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke with confidence.

“Grandmaster, we’ll be troubling you on this then. Feel free to tell us what you need. Our Dragon Clan will surely spare no effort to cooperate with you! You can be certain that our Dragon Clan will compensate you generously for your effort!”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief even began to talk about the compensation they had prepared for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

And to be frank, the Dragon Clan was not just talking empty words over here. The compensation they had prepared was worth quite a fortune.

However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t seem to be interested in it at all. Instead, he lost his patience while the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was still reading through a list of items they had prepared, and he interjected, “Enough! There’s no need for you to go on anymore. This old man is not interested in the compensation you have prepared.”

“You’re not interested?”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words caused the faces of those from the Dragon Clan to turn grave.

The items they had prepared were invaluable possessions, especially for world spiritists. It was no exaggeration to say that they were treasures amongst treasures.

Ordinary world spiritists would have never been able to resist such temptation.

Yet, the old man before them actually said that he wasn’t interested?

“Grandmaster, may I ask what would interest you then? We’ll have it prepared for you right away,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“There’s no need to prepare anything. You just have to allow me and my disciple to enter the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground,” the Ox-nosed Old Priest replied.

“You want to enter our Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground?!”

The faces of those from the Dragon Clan darkened right away after hearing the Ox-nosed Old Priest’s request.

The Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground was a sacred place for the Dragon Clan. There was no way they could allow outsiders onto the premises!

“Grandmaster, could you ask for something else instead? It’s not that we want to deny you entry, but only the clan members of our Dragon Clan are allowed to enter our Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground. Outsiders are strictly forbidden from stepping onto the premises. This is a rule that was set by our ancestors. We seek your understanding regarding this.”

The one who explained the matter wasn’t the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief but Long Duan.

“Based on what I know, there has been an outsider who has entered the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground before. You granted others entry, only to block us out. Are you looking down on us over here?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist sneered.

“This won’t do, Grandmaster. We can’t allow you onto our Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground.”

“Those are just rumors, Grandmaster. You have been duped! Where did you hear this rumor from?”

“Such rumors are extremely damaging to the reputation of the Dragon Clan. We need to find the person and punish him harshly!”

Before Long Duan could even speak, the other Supreme Elders present had already harrumphed furiously. Not only were they denying the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s claim, but they also seemed determined to pursue the culprit who started these rumors.

But the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, who was watching their performance, simply flashed a light smile and said, “It looks like the Dragon Clan isn’t sincere about this. Since that’s the case, this old man shall take his leave then. Feng’er, let’s go!”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist flung his sleeves imposingly as he prepared to take his leave, and Chu Feng followed closely behind him.

“Grandmaster, please wait for a moment!”

Upon seeing this, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief immediately spoke out hurriedly.

He was in a fluster at this very moment.

No matter what, he couldn’t afford to let the other party leave right now.

In truth, he was caught off guard by what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had said because he knew that it wasn’t a mere rumor that an outsider had been to their Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground.

There was indeed a precedent of someone entering the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground before, and that person was no other than the man famed all over the Holy Light Galaxy, Zhuge Yuankong.

But this matter was only known by Zhuge Yuankong himself and the top echelons of the Dragon Clan. Given how they had kept this matter confidential, it should have been impossible for anyone else to know about it.

But since the news had already gotten out, there was no point fussing about it now. Even if he wanted to pursue the matter, now was not the time to do so.

“Grandmaster, the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground is one of our clan’s most important places. However, if you wish to enter the premises, it’s not entirely impossible. The condition is that I’ll have to enter together with you. Are you agreeable to this?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

His words had left the other Supreme Elders astonished, but this situation was at least still acceptable to them.

Between allowing an outsider to enter the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground and opening the Dragon Vein Source, it was clear that the latter should take precedence. After all, this matter would determine the future of the Dragon Clan.

“I accept your condition,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

“Disciple, aren’t you going to pay a visit to your friend? You can go ahead and find her. I don’t need you here for the time being,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly turned to Chu Feng and said.

“Ah?” Chu Feng was caught off-guard by how abruptly his name was mentioned.

“Ah what ah? That Long Xiaoxiao or something, she’s your friend, isn’t she? She saved your life once, right? Aren’t you here to thank her?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“Ah, yes!” Chu Feng nodded.

Chu Feng was still troubled as to how he could head over to help Long Xiaoxiao when the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly spoke up at this moment.

Even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist shouldn’t have known that Long Xiaoxiao was in a bad circumstance, somehow, Chu Feng had a feeling that the old man had intentionally said those words to help him.

Could it be that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had heard the voice transmission between him and Long Nanxun?

“Xiaoxiao is acquainted with this young friend over here?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly asked.

Just by looking at the Clan Chief’s expression, it was apparent that he was feeling deeply conflicted inside.

After all, it was due to his credit that Long Xiaoxiao and her mother fell through the ranks in the Dragon Clan at the moment.

If the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Chu Feng were to hear of what he did, their impression of him would surely be greatly discounted.

Of course, as the Clan Chief of the Dragon Clan, there was no way he would be bothered by what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Chu Feng’s perception of him was. It was just that the current situation left him with no choice but to care about it.

This was because their current perception could very well determine the future of their Dragon Clan.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
