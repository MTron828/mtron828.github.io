Chapter 5816: The Two Monsters

Chapter 5816: The Two Monsters

“You shouldn’t think too much into it, as I have only heard bits and pieces about it too. It could be possible that the copper gate is still intact in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. A treasure of that caliber is not something I can access, after all,” Ling Xiao said with a smile.

“Rest assured, Brother Ling Xiao. We’ll keep this matter a secret,” Long Chengyu said.

“We won’t go around telling others,” Qin Xuan added.

The crowd knew Ling Xiao was claiming it to be hearsay lest he get into trouble for divulging the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s secrets. The copper gate was likely to have truly disappeared from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, or else he wouldn’t have said so in the first place.

However, Xianhai Shaoyu didn’t let the conversation end there. “Have you forgotten about our Brother Chu Feng’s mother, Elder Jie Ranqing? There were indeed many formidable experts in the earlier years of the present era, but based on what I’ve heard, none of them possessed the Ruler’s Bloodline. Elder Jie Ranqing is a unique existence, even from the moment of her birth.”

Xianhai Shaoyu turned to Ling Xiao and said, “Ling Xiao, if Chu Feng has a good chance at opening the copper gate, don’t you think Elder Jie Ranqing could have pulled it off too?”

The crowd widened their eyes.

“You’re right! It could be possible, since it’s Elder Jie Ranqing we’re talking about here. Could that have been the case?”

Jie Ranqing was a unique existence. While none of those present here had ever seen her in person, they were well-versed in her incredible feats. Some even saw her as their goal and idolized her.

However, Ling Xiao sighed regretfully upon hearing Xianhai Shaoyu’s conjecture. “There’s a rumor in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that Lord Jie Ranqing has challenged the copper gate but failed.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Failed?”

The crowd was startled. This suggested that the copper gate might be harder than they had imagined.

“I heard Lord Jie Ranqing induced a phenomenon when she tried to open the copper gate. It was a close try. If only she had been a bit more prepared, she could have succeeded in opening the copper gate,” Jie Baobao said.

“I see,” Xianhai Shaoyu replied regretfully, as he was one of those who idolized Jie Ranqing. He honestly thought JIe Ranqing could have already entered the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation. However, his eyes soon lit up again, and he turned to Chu Feng. “If it isn’t Elder Jie Ranqing, is there a chance it could have been Brother Chu Feng’s father instead?”

“Chu Feng’s father?”

The crowd turned to Chu Feng. They didn’t know much about Chu Feng’s father, but they figured the latter was likely to be a formidable figure considering how powerful Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline was.

How else could Chu Feng’s father have caught Jie Ranqing’s eye in the first place?

Even so, the crowd subconsciously thought Chu Feng’s father was weaker than Jie Ranqing. It couldn’t be helped as Jie Ranqing’s accomplishments were immense, but none of them had heard about Chu Feng’s father before. They didn’t think it was likely for Chu Feng’s father to have opened the copper gate when even Jie Ranqing had failed.

“Chu Feng, do you think your father could have opened the copper gate?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“I don’t know how difficult the copper gate is as I haven’t seen it in person, but I don’t think there’s anything in this world my father can’t do,” Chu Feng replied confidently.

The crowd chuckled, thinking that Chu Feng was joking. It was normal for children to think their parents were the strongest in the world, after all.

“Brother Chu Feng, what’s your father’s cultivation level?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

The others looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with curiosity. While they didn’t think Chu Feng’s father could have opened the copper gate, they were curious to know how powerful he was.

“I don’t know.” Chu Feng shook his head.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re being too humble,” Long Chengyu suddenly spoke up. He turned to the crowd and said, “I don’t know exactly how powerful Chu Feng’s father is, but my father says that he is likely to have already reached Heavenly God level.”

“Heavenly God level?” The crowd was taken aback.

Was it possible for Chu Feng’s father, despite his young age, to have reached this legendary cultivation level?

“Long Chengyu, how do you know?” Qin Xuan asked.

“It’s not convenient for me to explain it, but I am certain Chu Feng’s father is a Heavenly God level cultivator,” Long Chengyu replied.

Back then, when the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect cornered them, Chu Feng invoked his protective formation to kill their enemies and save them. He had told the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief that his father was the one who had placed the protective formation in him.

From the prowess of the protective formation, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief deduced that Chu Feng’s father was a Heavenly God level cultivator.

“I’m not surprised. Only a person of that caliber could move Elder Jie Ranqing’s heart and have a child as talented as Chu Feng.” Xianhai Shaoyu chuckled.

Chu Feng responded with a smile. He turned to the crowd and asked, “How are you adapting to the pressure?”

“We’ll need a bit more time. Brother Chu Feng, is there a time limit?” Long Chengyu, Qin Xuan, and the others frowned out of worry.

The Immemorial Land of Dao Creation was a golden opportunity. They were only chatting here instead of charging right in because they were still adapting to the pressure.

“I can’t say for sure whether there’s a time limit, but this challenge is not a group trial but an individual trial. Thus, I’d advise you to make a move as soon as you’re ready,” Chu Feng said.

“Brother Chu Feng, y-y-you should go ahead first. I-I-I’ll catch up very soon,” Wang Qiang said.

Chu Feng knew that Wang Qiang wasn’t ready yet, so he turned to Xianhai Shaoyu.

“I still need a bit more time to adapt to the pressure,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Chu Feng, you should go ahead,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“I can’t believe you’re able to adapt to this pressure so quickly. You’re truly a monster. It’s no wonder you’re the champion of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Feng Ling said with a euphonious voice.

She thought of herself as a prodigy too, but the pressure was so great that she needed more time to adapt to it. On the other hand, it was clear Chu Feng was ready to move on judging from his words.

Shoosh!

Just then, Little Fishy flitted over to Chu Feng’s side and said with a sweet smile, “Big brother, I’m ready too.”

“Turns out there are two monsters here.” Feng Ling shrugged helplessly.
