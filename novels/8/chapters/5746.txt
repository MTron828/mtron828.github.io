Chapter 5746: Men Aren’t Allowed

“You know each other?” Qin Xuan asked.

“We’re old acquaintances,” Liu Kuo replied frankly.

“That explains your biased judgment. You know each other. Is this what you mean by upholding fairness? Where’s Master Nine Zenith? I want to voice my grievances!” Qin Xuan shouted while looking around.

He felt like he had been made a fool. When had he, the strongest prodigy of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, ever been treated in such a way?

“Stop shouting. What are you making a fuss for? Are you having trouble hearing, or is your memory that bad? Didn’t I just tell you that my master is in closed-door cultivation?” Liu Kuo replied impatiently. “My master isn’t around. I’m the one who calls the shots here. You should leave if you have a problem with that.”

He pointed toward the road leading out of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“Aren’t you scared the world will laugh at you for being so biased?” Qin Xuan asked.

“Qin Shu wasn’t afraid of being laughed at when he colluded with the Bluemoon Sacred Palace; what do I have to fear?” Liu Kuo asked.

“Don’t talk nonsense!” Qin Xuan roared.

“You should know better whether I’m talking nonsense or not,” Liu Kuo replied in disdain.

Qin Xuan gritted his teeth, but there was nothing he could do. The Nine Heavens’ Zenith was a unique existence in the world of cultivation; he couldn’t hope to intimidate it with the influence of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.

He had only shouted earlier in hopes of rallying the crowd against this injustice, but the crowd only chatted amongst themselves; no one stood forward to speak on his behalf. This made him realize that he had no choice but to lower his head now that he was no longer on his home turf.

None of these prodigies dared to offend Liu Kuo in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

Other than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, no one would dare to side with him.

Just then, Liu Kuo turned to the crowd and said, “You may feel free to voice out if you feel that I, Liu Kuo, was unjust in my verdict.”

The noisy crowd immediately fell silent. They didn’t even dare to chatter among themselves anymore, fearing that Liu Kuo might misinterpret their actions.

Liu Kuo nodded in satisfaction before he turned to Qin Xuan and said, “See, you’re the only one who thinks I was unjust. That’s your problem then, not mine.”

Qin Xuan felt frustrated. He had never felt so indignant before.

“Come, Brother Chu Feng. I’ll show you the residence we have prepared for you in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Liu Kuo turned around and grabbed Chu Feng’s arm with a beaming smile. His attitude changed so quickly that it was clear whose side he was on.

Liu Kuo also turned to Little Fishy and the others and said, “Little sisters, come with me too… Ah no, I mean ‘misses’. Hehehe.”

Little Fishy frowned, but she didn’t say a word since Liu Kuo was Chu Feng’s friend.

“B-b-b-brother, I still have m-m-matters to attend to. I-I-I-I’ll head back first. S-s-see you later,” Wang Qiang said.

“Go and do what you have to,” Chu Feng said.

“A-a-all right!” Wang Qiang replied before returning to his residence.

Chu Feng and the others followed Liu Kuo into the white fog.

As soon as Liu Kuo and the others left, a huge commotion broke out amidst the crowd.

“It’s over. It’s all over. Even the Nine Heavens’ Zenith is on Chu Feng’s side. It’s no wonder he dares to come here. It turns out that no one is able to do anything about him here!”

“But why does Chu Feng have so many connections? Is his father actually capable? How else did he get acquainted with so many powerful figures?”

Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the others followed Liu Kuo into the white fog and arrived at Chu Feng’s residence. The first thought that came to their mind was ‘huge’. There was a towering mountain, a grand waterfall, a vast plain, and that wasn’t all of it yet!

All of the prodigies who managed to reach the Nine Heavens’ Zenith lived in places as huge as a realm; Chu Feng’s residence wasn’t exactly impressive by that standard.

However, everything was relative. This was the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, not their home. Even Little Fishy’s residence consisted of only a residence and a courtyard, and that was the privilege accorded to invitees. Ordinary people only received a little house.

“Wah, this is unfair! I was invited too, but why is Chu Feng’s residence much more luxurious?” Feng Ling grumbled with a pout.

“I’m starting to get Qin Xuan’s indignation,” Xianhai Shaoyu remarked with a smile.

“Benefactors, you’re misunderstanding me here. My master was the one who prepared this place for Chu Feng,” Liu Kuo said. He turned to Xianhai Shaoyu and Feng Ling and added, “You were at the last Nine Heavens’ Zenith. You should remember why it stopped halfway, right?”

“You said that the tournament can only continue when all prodigies are invited, right? Ah, was the prodigy Master Nine Zenith referring to Chu Feng?” Feng Ling asked.

“I didn’t say that, but Brother Chu Feng is indeed indispensable to our Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Liu Kuo said.

“Don’t say that. I’m only here to see my friends and join the commotion. My cultivation is hardly enough to compete with the others,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Chu Feng was one of the strongest juniors in the world of cultivation, but his strength was still not enough to match the likes of Xianhai Shaoyu, Little Fishy, Feng Ling, and others.

“Brother Chu Feng, the trials in our Nine Heavens’ Zenith differ from time to time. What we measure isn’t just an individual’s current strength but their future potential too,” Liu Kuo said.

“Isn’t that unfair?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng had never feared anyone when it came to measuring potential, but that was not the kind of competition he was looking for. All of the strongest prodigies of the world of cultivation were gathered here; it would be such a waste to just compare their potential.

Instead, they should decide the best one amongst them with their strength and skills. That would be far more interesting.

“Perhaps so, but the Nine Heavens’ Zenith has the final say regarding the competition format,” Liu Kuo replied.

He led the group toward a floating palace—Chu Feng’s residence. This residence was grand, and the cloudless sky provided a clear view of the scenery beneath.

“We’re all humans, but why is there such a huge disparity between us? Ey, I don’t want to return to my residence anymore. Can I stay here?” Feng Ling asked.

Instead of answering, Liu Kuo squeezed one of the prayer beads and pointed his finger at Chu Feng, sending a ray of light into the latter’s body. He was granting Chu Feng control over the formation. With this, Chu Feng could sense what was happening outside his residence, and he would know if someone wanted to visit him.

Only then did Liu Kuo turn to Feng Ling and say, “Benefactor Feng Ling, Brother Chu Feng calls the shots here. Alternatively, my residence also has free space. Hehehe.”

“I shan’t trouble you, uncle,” Feng Ling replied.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Oof… I’m actually not that old,” Liu Kuo explained.

Feng Ling ignored him and instead turned to Chu Feng, asking, “Chu Feng, can I stay here?”

“Feel free to stay here if you wish,” Chu Feng said.

“I want to stay here too!” Xian Miaomiao exclaimed.

“Big sister Miaomiao, are you really going to stay here too?” Little Fishy asked.

“Of course!” Xian Miaomiao nodded.

“Great! I shall accompany big sister here too,” Little Fishy replied.

“My little sister, it’s not as if you’re particularly close to Miss Miaomiao. She doesn’t need your company. Stop using her as an excuse and pretend to be demure. Why don’t you just say that you wish to be with Chu Feng?” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“None of your business.” Little Fishy glared at Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Hmph, women!” Xianhai Shaoyu sneered. He turned to Chu Feng and said, “Brother Chu Feng, you know what I’m going to ask, right?”

“You’re all free to stay here,” Chu Feng said.

Long Chengyu’s eyes lit up upon hearing those words. “Since that’s the case, I also…”

“Men aren’t allowed,” Little Fishy quickly interjected.

“Ah…” Long Chengyu was left fidgeting awkwardly on the spot. His excitement had vanished without a trace.
