Chapter 5956: Replaced by Chu Feng

“Is Jie Tian still in there?” Chu Feng asked.

“He should be. He has been in there for days now, and no one has seen him leaving,” the freckled man pointed to the spirit formation gate deep in the hall as he said.

“If Jie Tian learns that Chu Feng has broken his record and stolen his token, would he challenge the trial again?” Chu Feng asked.

“If Chu Feng breaks Jie Tian’s record and obtains the death immunity token, Jie Tian’s death immunity token will transform into a challenge formation. As long as he’s in this remnant, he’ll be able to challenge Chu Feng right away. The two of them will compete in a formation realm. However, such an incident has never happened before. I only heard about this rule from the rumors.”

“If the rumor is true, it’ll happen today.”

“How do you know?”

“Because I am Chu Feng.”

“Haha! Brother, you sure know how to joke around.” The freckled man didn’t believe Chu Feng.

Chu Feng morphed into a surge of light and entered the shield. He had been examining the so-called death immunity token while chatting with the freckled man, and he had already deciphered its crux.

The freckled man was right. The death immunity token could be divided into three stages.

The first stage made one immune to damage from formations, but they could die if they encountered other experts. They would only be spared from death once.

The second stage also made one immune to damage from formations, but they could die if they encountered other experts. They would be spared from death thrice.

The third stage made one immune to damage from formations and other experts. They would be spared from death ten times.

Jie Ranqing’s death immunity token was gold but she had cleared the third challenge, obtaining the third stage death immunity token. But clearing the third challenge was not easy, and one had to find the method to challenge it first.

Ordinary people wouldn’t even know that there were three stages to the death immunity token.

Chu Feng slipped into the formation realm inside the death immunity token, where he found himself floating above a vast ocean filled with dangers.

“I’ll die if I drop in,” Chu Feng murmured.

Formation words appeared in the sky, informing him that there was only one path to survive in the ocean. He had two hours to find that path and safely escape from this place.

The next second, the formation words dissipated and fell into the ocean.

The ocean bubbled, and countless schools of fishes pounced around.

Upon closer look, Chu Feng realized that those weren’t fishes but formation runes, and they were moving swiftly. These formation runes could only be clearly seen from a close distance, so he quickly memorized them while moving around.

He recorded the formation runes bit by bit before slowly putting them together like puzzle pieces.

An hour later, Chu Feng was forcefully dragged into the ocean water.

The area he had fallen into was a safe zone, but he needed to make his way out of this ocean within the next hour.

Under normal circumstances, he could have easily made his way out of this ocean within seconds, let alone an hour. But there was only one safe path in this vast ocean, and he would have to take that path if he wanted to leave.

It also didn’t help that this path was complicated.

However, this wasn’t enough to stump Chu Feng. He had deciphered and memorized the safe path over the past hour.

In less than an hour’s time, he swam his way out of the ocean.

As soon as he left the ocean, the formation power inside the ocean flowed out and morphed into a gold token. This gold token didn’t have any name inscribed in its center, suggesting that it didn’t have a master yet.

In the hall outside the formation realm, the silver token bearing Jie Tian’s name emanated a blinding light. By the time the light receded, the silver token had already turned gold, and Jie Tian’s name was no longer on it.

This caught everyone’s attention.

In the formation, Chu Feng began inscribing his name on the gold token. He knew that this death immunity token would be his once he put his name on it.

What he didn’t know was that his name was also being inscribed on the gold token outside the formation realm.

“Chu Feng? Why would Chu Feng’s name suddenly appear on this death immunity token?”

“Chu Feng must have come here! He broke Jie Tian’s record and claimed the junior’s death immunity token!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The crowd quickly made sense of the situation. There was no other explanation for the situation aside from this.

“Heavens! Was the person I met just now really Chu Feng? My gosh! How can I be this lucky?”

The freckled man who had chatted with Chu Feng earlier was thrilled. He clasped his head with his hands and squealed in excitement. His voice was so loud that it could be clearly heard even within the bustling hall.

At the same time, thousands of world spiritists wearing the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s robes were slowly advancing in the depth of this remnant. Just then, a person standing at the center looked at the token floating beside him.

This person was none other than Jie Tian.

The others sensed that something was amiss and turned to look at the token.

“What’s wrong, young master Jie Tian?” the other world spiritists asked.

Jie Tian’s death immunity token hadn’t triggered once thanks to their protection, but a crack had just appeared on the token, and formation power was spilling out from it.

A second later, the death immunity token suddenly shattered. A formation manifested from within and enveloped Jie Tian.

“Young master Jie Tian!”

The elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion panicked. They tried to breach the formation to save Jie Tian, only to find that they were unable to do anything about it.

“Don’t bother. You can’t breach this formation,” Jie Tian said with a darkened face.

Unlike the others, he had already understood what was going on as soon as the formation enveloped him.

“What’s happening, young master Jie Tian?”

The elders were scared out of their wits, knowing how important Jie Tian was to their Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. If something happened to Jie Tian, they would be severely punished for failing to protect him.

“Someone has challenged me for the death immunity token,” Jie Tian replied.

“What? Who would dare to challenge young master Jie Tian’s place?” the elders exclaimed in disbelief.

“Chu Feng,” Jie Tian stoically replied.

“Chu Feng? H-he’s here?”

“Don’t worry. Stay here and wait for me. I’ll take back possession of this death immunity token,” Jie Tian replied before vanishing into thin air. He had used the energy inside the death immunity token to teleport into the formation realm.

“Lord Saint-tier Elder.”

The crowd turned to Ling Mouzi, one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Saint-tier elders.

This journey hadn’t been easy for them, as they had opted for a path they had never ventured before. It required a powerful world spiritist of Ling Mouzi’s caliber to maintain the path. If they turned back now, their efforts would have been in vain.

Jie Tian had clearly gone to answer Chu Feng’s challenge, and admittedly, they weren’t sure if Jie Tian was a match for the latter.

“Follow me back,” Ling Mouzi ordered.

The thousands of world spiritists morphed into a surge of light, and they headed back to the hall.
