Chapter 5039: Indignant

“Ssss!”

Many people gasped at the sight. It came as a huge shock to the crowd, be it the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy or the members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

They realized how serious the problem was, prompting them to reconsider what Jiang Kongping had just said. Even a fool could tell that something was clearly amiss here.

Meanwhile, Sima Xiangtu ignored the crowd and waved his sleeves once more.

The gates to the confinement formation opened, and Shengguang Baimei, Daoist Niantian, the Godwish Grandmother, the Lady of Dao Sea, Princess Xiaoxiao, and the others were pushed out of the formation over to his side.

“Good job, Chu Feng!”

“As expected of young hero Chu Feng.”

The Lady of Dao Sea, Shengguang Baimei, and the others couldn’t help but compliment Chu Feng for his deed. Even though they were trapped inside the confinement formation, they could see what was going on outside due to the unique nature of the formation.

They thought that they were doomed after being captured by Sima Xiangtu, but who could have thought that Chu Feng would come to their rescue? It filled them with relief.

However, Chu Feng wasn’t done here yet. Most of his friends had been released, but there was one person whom Sima Xiangtu was still holding onto, and he was none other than the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Sima Xiangtu, release my master,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, don’t go too far. You should be glad that I have released these people.”

Sima Xiangtu made it clear that he had no intention of releasing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Chu Feng’s eyes turned cold upon hearing those words. He began activating another formation in his body, and the next moment, innumerable lightning snakes began tunneling around his body.

Tzzzz!

Gah!

Jiang Kongping let out a heart-wrenching cry.

There were no lightning snakes in his body, but he could feel the very same pain Chu Feng was feeling. On top of that, the same injuries that were being inflicted on Chu Feng were appearing on his body too.

“Sima Xiangtu, hurry up and release his master or whatever! Do you really want to die?” Jiang Kongping bellowed.

However, Sima Xiangtu ignored Jiang Kongping this time around and kept his eyes firmly on Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, I’ll have you know that there’s no one from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect here at the moment. You should understand what I mean. It’s on young master Kongping’s account that I allowed you to take those people away with you. However, if you wish to push your luck, I have no intention of letting you get your way.”

Chu Feng’s heart clenched upon hearing those words.

The meaning behind Sima Xiangtu’s words was apparent. Since there was no one from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect around, even if Jiang Kongping were to die here, Sima Xiangtu could simply massacre everyone and seal off the news.

By then, no one would know that he had left Jiang Kongping to the lurch.

In other words, Sima Xiangtu wasn’t afraid of Jiang Kongping dying.

If things really got to that extent, Chu Feng and everyone else would lose their lives here.

“My good disciple, Chu Feng, listen to me. Don’t bother about me. He’s holding onto me because he needs me for something. I won’t be in danger for the time being. You should leave with your friends first.

“Also, you did well today. You didn’t let me down.”

Chu Feng received a voice transmission from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Chu Feng looked at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and saw that the latter was looking back at him. Despite being nailed to a wooden board, there was a heartened and proud smile on his face. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It left Chu Feng feeling bitter inside. It pained him that he couldn’t do anything to save the Ox-nosed Old Daoist when the latter was right in front of him, but he knew that there was no way around it.

He couldn’t actually kill Jiang Kongping for that would spell his death too.

By then, everyone else whom he had saved would lose their lives too. That was a price too heavy to pay.

Putong!

Chu Feng suddenly kneeled down to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Master, forgive me for my weakness. I swear that I’ll grow strong enough to save you one day!”

After saying those words, Chu Feng rose to his feet and shot a vicious glare at Sima Xiangtu. Without saying a word, he turned around, opened a spirit formation gate, and left together with the Godwish Grandmother and the others.

The spirit formation gate automatically closed once the last of them passed through it.

Shortly after Chu Feng left, Sima Xiangtu tossed an object into the sky.

Weng!

The object emanated a brilliant light that sealed off the surroundings. It was a sealing formation, one so powerful that it was impossible to construct within a short period of time. Clearly, Sima Xiangtu had prepared it in advance.

“Since all of you are already here, have a good rest and wait for the pill to refine your body,” Sima Xiangtu said before disappearing into thin air.

He took Jiang Kongping away with him.

As soon as the two of them disappeared, the crowd began howling sorrowfully. With such a powerful sealing formation cast around them, it was clear that they had become Sima Xiangtu’s prisoners.

Without a doubt, Sima Xiangtu was up to no good. Perhaps, the young master from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect might have even been speaking the truth. They might just become ingredients in Sima Xiangtu’s pill concoction.

Those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan also swiftly realized that they were in a bad position.

Putting aside Sima Xiangtu’s powerful cultivation, just his collusion with the powerful Pill Dao Immortal Sect was enough to render them powerless. Without a doubt, this was a calamity.

…

Meanwhile, Sima Xiangtu actually hadn’t gone too far away. He took Jiang Kongping into a palace.

This palace wasn’t constructed by the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but its resilience was beyond imagination. It was floating above the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, just that it was concealed from view. From its position, one could get a bird’s eye view of what was happening below.

It wasn’t just Sima Xiangtu and Jiang Kongping who were inside the palace at the moment. In fact, there were several hundred people in here, and none of them could be made light of.

From their attire, one could tell that they were all from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

Many experts of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had taken out their treasures, using them as mediums to construct formations in order to dispel the soul-linking formation between Jiang Kongping and Chu Feng.

However, some of them were also eyeing Sima Xiangtu with eyes filled with fury and even killing intent. They were infuriated as Jiang Kongping was put in a perilous position earlier on due to him being unwilling to release the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Sima Xiangtu, you better give me a reasonable explanation as to why you refused to release that man. If you can’t give me a satisfactory answer, I’ll take your life right now!” an infuriated voice bellowed.

It was from Lord Taibai, the man who defeated the Netherworld Envoy the other day.

It turned out that they had witnessed everything that had happened from the start to the end!
