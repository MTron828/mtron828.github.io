Chapter 4414: Unfair

There was a tight knit on the foreheads of Long Xiaoxiao, her parents, and Yu Ting. It was apparent that they were worried about Chu Feng, especially for Long Xiaoxiao and Yu Ting, who were sweating profusely out of fear.

They were afraid that Chu Feng would lose the duel.

The formation that Li Muzhi had brought out was simply too complicated.

This was the first time they were seeing this formation, so they knew for sure that it was foreign to Chu Feng too. They couldn’t help but worry if Chu Feng would really be able to set up the formation within an incense’s time or not.

If he couldn’t do it, that would only mean that Chu Feng’s talent in world spiritist techniques was beneath that of Li Muzhi’s.

However, the most frightening thing was that if Chu Feng were to lose the duel, he could very well lose his life. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Out of trepidation of what that was to come, the entire surroundings fell silent. It was so quiet that one could hear the sound of the wind and the furious palpitations of the heartbeats around.

Everyone’s eyes, even those of Li Muzhi’s grandfather, were gathered on Chu Feng.

And in the end, the one who broke the silence was Chu Feng himself.

“Time it well. If I take more than an incense’s time, my life will be yours to take.”

Chu Feng’s words, as well as his confident demeanor that was devoid of fear, managed to assuage some of the worries of Long Xiaoxiao’s and the others.

Weng!

Right after saying those words, Chu Feng began releasing his spirit power to construct a divine and resplendent formation before him.

However, as soon as Chu Feng made a move, the expressions on the faces of Long Xiaoxiao’s parents turned unnerved once more.

“Did young master Chu Feng make a mistake somewhere?” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother remarked in unease as she looked at Chu Feng intently.

Li Muzhi, who was standing opposite to Chu Feng, even started shaking his head with a derisive smile on his face. It was almost as if victory was already within his grasp.

In truth, Chu Feng’s construction of the formation was going extremely smoothly, such that his speed of construction was faster than even that of Li Muzhi’s.

Saying that he was fast would be a gross understatement.

Anyone looking at it would wonder if it was really the first time he was constructing this formation.

If what Li Muzhi had achieved earlier was a splendid feat, Chu Feng would have indubitably topped that.

However, there was a problem with how Chu Feng was constructing the formation, and even Long Xiaoxiao’s mother and the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief could tell that something was amiss.

There was a specific process to construct a formation, making sequencing extremely important.

Drawing a metaphor, it would be like choosing a route. If one were to make a wrong turn right from the start, it was unlikely that one would ever reach the destination.

Time passed quickly.

Half an incense’s time seemed to pass in an instant, and soon enough, it looked like an incense’s time was going to be up.

Time was running out, but Chu Feng still hadn’t completed his formation yet.

Even though Chu Feng’s hands were moving so quickly that one could only see after shadows, there were still no signs that he was going to be done anytime soon.

“Father, what do we do? Time is already running out!” Long Xiaoxiao turned to her father and asked anxiously.

It went without saying that she couldn’t stand by and watch Chu Feng die, so if Chu Feng were to lose by any chance, she hoped that her father could step in and save him.

After all, the only one who could possibly save Chu Feng here was only her father.

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief understood his daughter’s intentions, but he dared not to make her any promises. He was unwilling to offend the expert in the sky for Chu Feng.

“Elder.”

Seeing that her father wasn’t responding to her, Long Xiaoxiao could only turn to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to seek his assurance.

However, in contrast to the crowd, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t look nervous at all. He simply replied calmly, “Princess Xiaoxiao, there’s no need to worry.”

It was almost as if he wasn’t worried for Chu Feng’s safety at all!

This left Long Xiaoxiao feeling deeply bewildered. An incense’s time was going to be up very soon, but the formation Chu Feng had constructed hadn’t even taken on a preliminary shape yet. It should be as clear as day that Chu Feng wouldn’t be able to complete his formation in time anymore.

Weng!

But at this moment, a glimmer of light suddenly appeared.

Following that, a bizarre sound echoed from the formation Chu Feng was constructing.

“Formation synthesis!”

Chu Feng placed his palms together as he bellowed loudly.

A piercing explosion sounded from within the formation, and the chaotic pieces of the formation all around began coming together like puzzle pieces.

In the blink of an eye, a complete slaughtering formation was already standing right before Chu Feng.

This was the same formation which Li Muzhi had provided to him!

“He actually successfully set up the formation?”

Seeing this sight, Long Xiaoxiao, Yu Ting, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, and the others were stupefied. They didn’t think that Chu Feng would succeed.

Even though he succeeded at the very last moment, it was still a fact that he had finished constructing Li Muzhi’s formation within an incense’s time.

Furthermore, the way he constructed the formation was very different from that of Li Muzhi’s. If they hadn’t seen the end product, they would have found it hard to believe that Chu Feng was building the same formation as Li Muzhi.

Meanwhile, Li Muzhi also had an indescribable look on his face after seeing the formation Chu Feng had constructed.

He was in a state of disbelief. He couldn’t accept that Chu Feng had successfully constructed his formation either, so he began assessing the formation closely, wanting to see if anything was wrong.

Yet, no matter how he looked, he wasn’t able to find any problems with it.

Chu Feng had really used another method to reconstruct his formation perfectly.

“Are you done checking? Does my formation meet your standards?” Chu Feng asked.

“Heh...” Li Muzhi first chuckled to himself before he answered Chu Feng, “Interesting. It looks like you have some tricks up your sleeves, hm?”

“Tricks?”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng shook his head with a smile, not refuting Li Muzhi at all.

As the saying went, ‘when living under the roof of another, one has no choice but to lower one’s head’.

Chu Feng didn’t fear Li Muzhi, but he still had to pay some heed to the expert in the sky. The expert in the sky wielded the power to determine Yu Ting’s fate once she returned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

For this reason, Chu Feng didn’t dare to say awful words. He could only tolerate it all for Yu Ting’s sake.

“Since you have won the second round, we’ll move on to the final battle then. Your formation might look fine on the surface, but we’ll still have to verify its prowess in battle,” Li Muzhi said.

“I’m also interested to see how far you have gone with my formation too,” Chu Feng replied.

“Heh... Even though your formation is lackluster, I can assure you that you’ll see something spectacular from it under my hands. Today, I shall show you how I use an inferior formation to overcome something that’s supposedly stronger! I shall let you know that the strength of a world spiritist is what that determines the final might of the formation!” Li Muzhi declared confidently.

He was trampling down on Chu Feng to promote his own formation, and through doing so, he was highlighting that Chu Feng was beneath him.

But at this very instant, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly spoke up, “Young friend over there, pardon this old man for butting in, but isn’t it unfair for the two of you to battle it out right now in such a manner?”

Those words were, of course, directed toward Li Muzhi.
