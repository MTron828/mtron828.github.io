Chapter 3137 - A Transaction

“Chu Feng, are you really planning to hand that Immortal Crystal Ore to her? That Immortal Crystal Ore is extremely powerful; if you are to use it yourself, it will definitely allow you to reach a breakthrough in your cultivation,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Indeed, the power of the Immortal Crystal Ore is very alluring. Unfortunately, I cannot snatch it away from the hands of a little girl. That goes against my principles,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he stretched out his hand and made a grabbing motion. The Immortal Crystal Ore was sucked into Chu Feng’s hand. Then, Chu Feng handed the Immortal Crystal Ore to the little girl.

The little girl carefully extended her little hand and received the Immortal Crystal Ore. After receiving it, she immediately put it away. Then, she took two steps back, and continued to look at Chu Feng with an alert expression.

After verifying that Chu Feng did not plan to snatch her treasure, she asked, “You’re really planning to return it to me?”

“Why would I lie to you?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“Don’t you know what this is? It’s Immortal Crystal Ore. Every time the Immortal Rivers appear, only three such Immortal Crystal Ores will appear in the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,” The little girl said.

“I know that it is very enticing. However, since you’re the one who discovered it, I will not snatch it from you,” Chu Feng said.

“Actually, this Immortal Crystal Ore is sufficient for many people to train with. Let’s do this: if you are to bring me away from here safely, we can share this Immortal Crystal Ore together,” The little girl said.

“Are you trying to negotiate with me?” Chu Feng smiled.

The little girl’s childish voice was very adorable. Although she sounded like a child, she was negotiating with him like an adult. Chu Feng found it very amusing.

“You can call it a negotiation,” The little girl said.

“In that case, tell me your name and which clan you’re from. Do that, and I’ll accept your request,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng had carefully observed the little girl with his Heaven’s Eyes, and verified that she was indeed only seven or eight years old.

For a seven or eight-year-old girl to possess the cultivation of rank five Heavenly Immortal was simply too frightening.

She was what an actual demon-level genius would be.

Thus, Chu Feng wanted to know which clan had managed to produce such an amazing genius.

“I cannot tell you which clan I’m from. However, I can tell you my name. I am called Bai Liluo.”

“Bai Liluo?” Chu Feng remembered the name.

“What about you? What’s your name?” The little girl asked.

“I am called Chu Feng. You can call me uncle Chu Feng,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“You’re not that old, why should I address you as uncle? Are you trying to take advantage of me?”

“No, I’m going to call you little brother Chu Feng,” The little girl said stubbornly.

“Haha. You will be taking advantage of me then,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“I don’t care. I’m calling you little brother Chu Feng. Well then, little brother Chu Feng, enough with the superfluous words, bring big sister away from this place.”

As the little girl spoke, she went behind Chu Feng and leaped onto his back. Her little hand grabbed Chu Feng’s shoulder tightly.

“Little girl, you’re trying to have me carry you out on my back?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. With how dangerous this place is, only by being beside you will I be safe. Now, enough superfluous words. Let’s go.”

“Oh, also, make sure to be careful. Those things are not as simple as you thought them to be. As long as we carry the Immortal Crystal Ore with us, they will attack us nonstop,” The little girl said.

“Rest assured, my big sister Liluo. I, Chu Feng, guarantee that you will safely leave this place,” Chu Feng smiled. As he spoke, he started to quickly fly deeper into the fog. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Bang, bang, bang~~~”

Once Chu Feng began to move, the monsters appeared again. Furthermore, seemingly as if they were capable of figuring out where Chu Feng was going, they completely surrounded Chu Feng, and continued to appear before him.

However, those monsters did not pose any threat to Chu Feng. Chu Feng merely swept out with his oppressive might and destroyed all of the emerging monsters in his path. The monsters were unable to hinder Chu Feng in the slightest.

That said, even though the monsters did not pose any threat, the little girl started to panic. The reason for that was because she discovered that Chu Feng was not leaving the fog, but instead proceeding deeper into it.

“Why are you going further inside?” The little girl asked.

“I need to find someone. Before finding that person, I cannot leave this place,” Chu Feng said.

“Who are you searching for? Is it a woman?” The little girl asked.

“That’s right, did you see her?” Chu Feng asked.

“I saw her. She’s been captured by people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan,” The little girl said.

“Captured?” Chu Feng’s heart tightened upon hearing those words.

“She was just captured. However, I’m very smart. I left a mark on those people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. Thus, I know where they are. Bring me away from here, and I will bring you to find her,” The little girl said.

“Tell me which direction they went,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll tell you the moment we’re out,” The little girl said.

“Little girl, don’t you lie to me. Otherwise, that Immortal Crystal Ore will not be yours anymore,” Chu Feng threatened.

“Do I look like a liar? What benefit is there for me to lie to you?” The little girl asked.

Indeed, there was no reason for the little girl to lie to Chu Feng. Furthermore, Chu Feng had been observing her the entire time, and determined that she was not lying.

“Little girl, grab tight,” After that, Chu Feng turned around and began to quickly rush toward the direction he came from.

Meanwhile, in another region of the vast cave, two groups of people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan had gathered together.

One of the groups was led by Qingyu Fengming. As for the other group, it was led by a middle-aged man with a goatee.

It was worth mentioning that the goateed man actually had an even stronger cultivation than Qingyu Fengming. He was a rank nine Heavenly Immortal, a peak Heavenly Immortal, only a step away from reaching the Martial Immortal realm, a step away from obtaining the purest Immortal-level martial power, and the ability to use Immortal Armaments.
