Chapter 5959: This Isn’t Your Turf

“You...” Jie Tian turned around and stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.

Initially, he was baffled as to how Chu Feng managed to maneuver behind him, but he soon noticed the teleportation energy around the latter.

“A teleportation formation? It looks like Chu Feng has an ace up his sleeves too. He had been discreetly preparing a teleportation formation on top of the enhancement formation. But how did he do so without alarming Jie Tian? This is inconceivable.”

“It’s one thing for us not to notice it since we’re just spectators, but did Jie Tian not sense a thing too?”

The crowd also figured out how Chu Feng was able to appear behind Jie Tian so quickly, but they still found this matter unbelievable. Such a feat should have been impossible in the midst of a battle.

“You still used the power enhancement token in the end, huh? Chu Feng, you didn’t win with your skills,” Jie Tian sneered in indignation.

“You’re talking about this?” Chu Feng fished out the power enhancement token from his robe.

The token was still intact, and it showed no signs of being activated.

“Who knows whether that’s real or not?” Jie Tian expressed his skepticism.

The others were skeptical as well. The power enhancement token was identical to what they saw before, but with Chu Feng’s ability, it shouldn’t be tough for him to create a lookalike. They would have to examine it close up to verify its authenticity.

Just then, the formation’s voice echoed, “The challenge has failed. The current holder retains possession of the death immunity token. The power enhancement token will be withdrawn.”

The power enhancement token flew into the air and vanished.

The crowd was stunned. There was no need for further verification anymore, for that voice was the greatest proof.

Chu Feng didn’t use the power enhancement token. He was able to discreetly construct the teleportation formation without relying on external means. Just how precise was his control over his spirit power then?

The formation realm disintegrated. Both Chu Feng and Jie Tian were teleported back to the hall.

Whoosh!

Countless chains suddenly shot out, as a terrifying oppressive might enveloped the area. Thousands of figures wearing the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s world spiritist robes appeared at the same time.

“Ah, aren’t you Saint-tier Elder Ling Mouzi? You’re alive?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“Chu Feng, I didn’t expect you to be so brazen as to dare appear before me again.” Ling Mouzi’s eyes were cold.

He remembered how Chu Feng ran amok in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and that made his blood boil with rage.

“So what if I appear before you? What can you do?” Chu Feng scoffed.

His attitude made it clear that he didn’t think highly of the Saint-tier elder.

“You’re already meat on a chopping board.”

“Is that so? You must not want your young master Jie Tian alive.”

Chu Feng began pulling out the blade he had plunged into Jie Tian’s chest to torture the latter. He was planning to use Jie Tian’s life to threaten them.

However, Ling Mouzi formed a hand seal, and one of the formation chains darted like a flying sword toward Chu Feng. The speed of his chain was much faster than the speed of Chu Feng retracting his blade.

This was the gap in their spirit power!

Before Chu Feng could torture Jie Tian, the formation chain had already pierced through his neck. Yet, the outcome was still baffling to the experts present.

They saw the chain piercing through Chu Feng’s neck with his own eyes, yet the chain seemed to pass right through him, not fazing Chu Feng in the least.

Did Ling Mouzi go easy on him?

Pu!

Ling Mouzi’s neck suddenly began bleeding.

The crowd was horrified.

Ling Mouzi hurriedly clutched his neck, but fresh blood wouldn’t stop flowing from it. He glared at Chu Feng with incredulous eyes.

“What’s going on?”

The situation wasn’t making sense to anyone.

“There’s blood on the chain!”

The crowd quickly noticed traces of blood on the chain that appeared to have passed through Chu Feng’s neck. If Chu Feng was unharmed by the attack, whose blood could that be?

Needless to say, it was Ling Mouzi’s blood.

The hole in Ling Mouzi’s neck was around the same thickness as the chain. It was as if the chain had pierced through his neck instead of Chu Feng’s.

What was going on here? Why did Ling Mouzi’s attack hurt himself instead?

“What are you doing? Why are you hurting yourself instead of capturing me?” Chu Feng asked with a mocking smile. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

His words hinted that this anomaly had something to do with him.

“Chu Feng, were you behind this?” the others from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion angrily asked.

“Would you believe me if I said I wasn't behind this?” Chu Feng scoffed.

He took his formation sword from Jie Tian’s body, but he did so with a horizontal slash.

Due to that, Jie Tian’s shoulders were severed. His face warped in pain, but he kept himself from making any noises.

“You sure can hold it in,” Chu Feng scoffed.

He plunged his formation sword into Jie Tian once more. This time, he aimed it at Jie Tian’s right chest.

“You’re courting death!”

Angered to see Chu Feng torturing Jie Tian before them, hundreds of Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s world spiritists simultaneously constructed formations to attack him. Their attacks weren’t fatal, but it would inflict grievous harm on him.

They had to curb Chu Feng as soon as possible, or else Jie Tian would be further harmed.

Uwa!

Fresh blood splattered all around, but Chu Feng was unharmed. Instead, the hundreds of world spiritists who attempted to attack Chu Feng were the ones who suffered damage. Their wounds were identical to the nature of their attacks.

“It really is Chu Feng’s doing. What’s going on?”

“Is it the death immunity token?”

“Or maybe he has some other protective means?”

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion panicked. They dared not to recklessly make a move anymore, knowing that whatever damage they dealt would be returned to them.

“What’s wrong? Why did you stop? Continue your attacks. Did you think this is your turf? You bunch of complacent fools. This is the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s turf!” Chu Feng sneered.

He could act so arrogantly because he knew he couldn’t be harmed here.

The gold death immunity token he had acquired made him invulnerable to not just formations inside this remnant but also enemies who sought to deal with him here. Those who attempted to attack him would receive damage instead.

This was the benefit of clearing the third stage, It was a true death immunity token!
