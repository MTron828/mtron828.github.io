Chapter 4628: An Ultimate Defensive Treasure

“Are you alright?”

Chu Feng turned to look at Xiao Yu as he swiftly constructed a recovery formation around Xiao Yu. Under the nourishing energy of the formation, Xiao Yu’s injuries quickly healed up, and the traces of blood on her body swiftly vanished too.

“It’s just superficial injuries.”

It was hard to tell whether Xiao Yu felt bad for implicating Chu Feng or that there were some other reasons at play, but she lowered her head, choosing not to look at Chu Feng at all.

However, her voice was no longer as cold as before anymore. It carried a hint of gentleness.

“It’s good that you’re fine,” Chu Feng replied leisurely.

He was already used to Xiao Yu’s coldness, so he didn’t pay her peculiarity any heed. On the contrary, he felt guilty for Xiao Yu and Xia Yan.

Even though it was an accident, he had indeed seen their nude bodies.

“Chu Feng, aren’t you a little too strong here? Even in your weakened state, you were still able to pummel Gongsun Yuntian easily!” Xia Yan walked out of the cavern over to Chu Feng’s side as she exclaimed excitedly.

“Ah, I almost forgot. I still need to deal with these fellows first.”

Chu Feng turned his eyes back to Gongsun Yuntian and the others.

They were still standing at the same spot, not attempting to escape at all. They knew that they wouldn’t be able to escape under the eyelids of someone as powerful as Chu Feng, so they didn’t bother doing so.

However, Chu Feng had a feeling that things weren’t as easy as that.

Weng!

All of a sudden, Gongsun Yuntian’s body began glowing red. The red glow was emanating from his heart, and it intensified along with the beating of his heart.

The emergence of the red glow brought a frown to Chu Feng’s forehead.

Xia Yan and Xiao Yu might not be able to sense it, but Chu Feng could clearly discern the changes occurring to Gongsun Yuntian’s body. As it turned out, there was a sliver of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace’s power hidden in Gongsun Yuntian’s body too.

In truth, Chu Feng’s earlier punch could have killed Gongsun Yuntian outright, but the latter survived due to a peculiar power protecting him.

If Chu Feng wasn’t mistaken, Gongsun Yuntian was carrying a treasure on him, and that treasure had already fused as one with his heart. It had protected his life earlier, and it was now granting him power.

The blood on Gongsun Yuntian’s face was swiftly absorbed by that power, and his mashed face began to recover too. His body slowly rose into the air and floated quietly on the spot.

And most notably of all, the aura he was emanating was much stronger than what it was earlier.

“What’s going on with that fellow?”

While Xia Yan and Xiao Yu couldn’t clearly discern what was happening to Gongsun Yuntian, they could sense that the latter was growing stronger by the moment.

“Yuntian, you actually... managed to grasp it to this level?”

The changes occurring to Gongsun Yuntian dispelled the despair of the Gongsun Clan’s prodigies, and joy emerged on their faces once more. It was as if a ray of hope had descended upon them.

“Chu Feng, I have really underestimated you. I knew that you had managed to grasp a portion of the powers of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, but I didn’t think that the degree of power you wielded had reached such a level.

“Where did you come from? What’s the power behind you? Who’s your teacher?” Gongsun Yuntian questioned Chu Feng.

“Why are you asking those questions? Are you afraid?” Chu Feng replied.

“Afraid? Are you even qualified to make me fear?” Gongsun Yuntian replied.

“Oh? I’m unqualified? I wonder who had his teeth shattered from my punch earlier on. Ah no, your face was so mashed up that even your mother wouldn’t have recognized you. Hah, what a tough front you’re putting on now!” Chu Feng sneered.

“You!!!”

Those words were a bullseye to Gongsun Yuntian, striking his most vulnerable spot. Rage rushed into his head as veins popped from his temples.

“You’re courting death!”

Gongsun Yuntian raised both of his hands to strike down on Chu Feng. Overwhelming spirit power poured out like the rapid tides of a river, crushing down on Chu Feng. This might was definitely not just at the level of a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator anymore.

Chu Feng dared not to take this attack lightly, so he also channeled his spirit power to fend against the attack.

The two spirit powers clashed with one another, creating shockwaves with a destructive might comparable to the strength of a Martial Exalted level cultivator.

Had it not been for Chu Feng protecting them, just these shockwaves would have been enough to kill Xia Yan and Xiao Yu.

Now that he was tapping into the power of his treasure, Gongsun Yuntian’s might, enhanced by the power of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, had risen to a terrifying level too.

As a result, this clash actually ended in a draw.

“The two of you, stand behind me!” Chu Feng ordered Xiao Yu and Xia Yan.

The two of them quickly took their place obediently behind Chu Feng. They knew very well that they had no place in a clash of this level, so their best bet was to follow his orders and lie low.

Weng!

As soon as the two of them backed away, a powerful formation barrier suddenly appeared in front of them, protecting them.

The two of them couldn’t help but feel a little moved.

The formation barrier was indubitably a lifesaver to them. At the very least, the clashes between Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian wouldn’t be able to hurt them anymore. However, they also knew that Chu Feng was in a weakened state, and the spirit power he was using to create the formation barrier for them was precious to him too.

That was why they were moved by this gesture.

After all, they were just acquaintances. In fact, their so-called alliance had just been Chu Feng taking care of them too. They hadn’t been much use to him along the way.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

A series of explosions sounded in the air.

A powerful shockwave suddenly rippled out into the surroundings like a ferocious inferno. Even the nearly indestructible walls in the surroundings suddenly began shaking intensely, as if they would topple over at any moment.

Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian began clashing with one another once more.

They were still using their spirit power to clash with one another, but oddly enough, their fight seemed to be that of one between cultivators instead. There weren’t amazing formations or much skill at play; it was more of like a direct clash in strength.

They were simply pitting the power they had gained from the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace against one another.

However, after a swift clash, the already uneasy Chu Feng started to feel a little pressured.

The power controlled by Gongsun Yuntian was stronger than he thought.

On top of that, Chu Feng had also expended a great amount of spirit power in order to obtain the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl, which meant that he was in a weakened state.

At this rate, he would really lose the battle.

Shoosh!

Unexpectedly, while Chu Feng was still fretting, Gongsun Yuntian suddenly began retreating hurriedly, leaping out of the center of the battle.
