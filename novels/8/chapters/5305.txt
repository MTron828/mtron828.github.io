Chapter 5305: Bai Yunqing Reveals His Capability

“What are you planning?” Jia Chengxiong asked lividly.

“What do you mean by that? I’m taking the test to enter the Ancient Realm,” Chu Feng replied.

“There are so many gates around. You don’t have to choose the same gate as me.”

“Shouldn’t I have the right to choose which gate I want to challenge?”

“You came out of the sixth gate! You should choose the sixth gate!”

“But this is the gate I want to challenge. What’s wrong? Are you getting afraid? Are you scared that you’ll lose to me?” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“What a joke! Do you really think that you’re the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator just because you won in the Trial of the Strongest? Let me tell you—I’m not afraid of you!” 

Jia Chengxiong’s lips quivered despite his brave words. He even shot a glance at Jia Chengying. 

“Know your place and get lost.” Jia Chengying sent a message to Chu Feng via voice transmission.

He was standing up for Jia Chengxiong because he knew that his younger brother was afraid of Chu Feng. 

“Why are you sending me a voice transmission? If you want to say something to me, say it out loud.” Chu Feng looked at Jia Chengying.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jia Chengying frowned. He thought that he could intimidate Chu Feng into submission with his strength and background, but the latter brazenly confronted him instead.

“What are you looking at? Instead of sending me threatening messages, why don’t you come here too so that I can kick you brothers out of this test together?” Chu Feng scoffed. 

The confused crowd quickly figured out what was going on. Jia Chengying must have secretly threatened Chu Feng to stay away from Jia Chengxiong’s gate, but Chu Feng adamantly refused to bow down to their demands.

Jia Chengying wouldn’t admit to having secretly threatened Chu Feng lest others think that he oppressed the weak, but he continued staring daggers at Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng wasn’t scared at all. 

Chu Feng had already realized that there was a formation here that prevented cultivators from attacking one another. Jia Chengying wouldn’t be able to harm him here. 

“Stop uttering rubbish. You think too highly of yourself. Why would my big brother threaten you? You’re speaking as if I’m afraid of you! Very well, let me see just how powerful the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator of our Totem Galaxy is!” 

Jia Chengxiong rolled up his sleeves as if he was ready to fight with Chu Feng. In truth, he was just trying to vindicate his big brother from Chu Feng’s accusations.

“Heh…” Chu Feng sneered.

He had already noticed that the ten gates here wouldn’t open on their own accord, so it was useless for them to idle around and wait. He would have to find a way to open them.

“I found the way to open the gate!” two voices echoed simultaneously.

It was Bai Yunqing and the man from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace. Surprised by each other’s declaration, the two of them exchanged glances before hurriedly forming hand seals. 

Boom!

Powerful spirit power comparable to a rank three Half-God level cultivator burst forth from the two of them. The two of them were Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists.

“Amazing. They are already Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists despite their young age. But who is that guy over there? I have never seen him before.”

The crowd was more interested in Bai Yunqing. 

They were aware how powerful the Bluemoon Sacred Palace was, so it wasn’t too surprising that one of their juniors had already reached Blue Dragon God-cloak. On the other hand, Bai Yunqing’s strength was a surprise to them. 

Bai Yunqing had never come into public view despite being the disciple of the Totem Dragon Clan’s First Guest Elder, so there weren’t many people who knew about him. 

Chu Feng looked at Bai Yunqing expectantly. 

He had previously crossed blows with Bai Yunqing at Lord Zhenlong’s remnant, and he nearly lost to the latter in a battle of talent. He had to admit that Bai Yunqing was superior to him in terms of deciphering formations back then.

But things were different now. Chu Feng had become a God-cloak World Spiritist, and his world spiritist techniques were much stronger after having inherited Lord Qin Jiu’s heritage. While his spirit power was still weaker than Bai Yunqing’s, he was looking forward to a rematch with him. 

The formations constructed by Bai Yunqing and the man from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace morphed into a wisp of aura, which then fused with the hall they were in.

Kacha!

The ten gates trembled before slowly creaking open. 

“Ah! I didn’t know we had to breach a formation in order to open the gates.”

The crowd was surprised. They had assumed that the gates would automatically open once there were enough people in the room. Their failure to notice the true nature of the gates left them even more impressed with Bai Yunqing. 

“Who’s that young hero? Why have I never heard about him before?”

Such questions began floating about.

This was the moment Bai Yunqing was waiting for. He immediately whipped out his master’s token.

Boom!

Dark clouds and thunder swiftly filled the area above the hall. Amidst the storm, the silhouette of a dragon could be vaguely seen. There was no question that this was the token of the Totem Dragon Clan’s First Guest Elder. 

Even the arrogant Jia Chengying was astonished to see the token.

“This is the token of the Totem Dragon Clan’s First Guest Elder, Lord Taishi. This brother over here, may I know who are you and what’s your relationship with Lord Taishi?” Jia Chengying stepped forward and asked with an amicable voice.

“I am Bai Yunqing. Lord Taishi is my master,” Bai Yunqing replied with a smile.

“What? He’s Lord Taishi’s disciple?”

“It’s no wonder he’s a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist despite his young age!”

Even though the crowd was, no one doubted the authenticity of Bai Yunqing’s claim. The token spoke for itself.

“I have been in closed-door training all this while, and it’s only recently that I’ve started moving around. I understand that you might be doubtful about my claims, but my master will soon be officially announcing our master-disciple relationship. By then, you’ll know whether I’m lying or not,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Brother Bai, no one will doubt you after witnessing your strength and the token you have in your possession. I am Jia Chengying from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. It’s my pleasure to meet you,” Jia Chengying said with a courteous bow.

He turned to Jia Chengxiong and urged, “You should thank Brother Bai too. You wouldn’t have stood a chance at all if he chose to compete with you over a slot.”

“Thank you for your magnanimity.” 

Despite Jia Chengxiong’s earlier horrible attitude, he carried himself with impeccable etiquette upon learning about the latter’s identity. That was also why it was good to have strong backing. 

“You’re too polite,” Bai Yunqing replied with a smile, not denying the claim that he had let Jia Chengxiong off the hook at all. 

In fact, Bai Yunqing even directed a threatening glare at Chu Feng. It was almost as if he was telling Chu Feng that he had become friends with Jia Chengying and Jia Chengxiong, and that any insult directed at them was an insult toward him too. 

Not one to be intimidated by threats, Chu Feng outright ignored Bai Yunqing.

Not expecting Chu Feng to be this arrogant, Bai Yunqing frowned. He wasn’t aware that the mysterious man he had encountered in Lord Zhenlong’s remnant was actually Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng didn’t reveal his identity or appearance back there. 

Just then, the ten gates fully opened.

The crowd immediately charged into their respective gates. Chu Feng and Jia Chengxiong were no exception. 

Chu Feng chose to slow down upon entering the gate to assess his surroundings. On the other hand, Jia Chengxiong activated his bloodline power and raised his cultivation by three ranks. 

Jia Chengxiong was indeed worthy of being dubbed a prodigy despite his horrible character. 

Jia Chengxiong didn’t advance right away after raising his fighting prowess. Instead, he turned to Chu Feng and sneered, “If not for the fact we aren’t allowed to fight here, I would have killed you with a slap. You have chosen the wrong person to fight against.”

Leaving those words behind, Jia Chengxiong rushed ahead at full speed. It didn’t take long before he started encountering obstacles, but he was able to clear them without having to slow down much. Thanks to that, he was able to make good progress. 

From time to time, he would turn around to check if Chu Feng had caught up with him, but the latter was nowhere to be seen. Figuring that Chu Feng was unable to catch up with him, a gleeful smile formed on his lips. 

“Hah! Is this the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator? I guess that’s all there is to it. If I wasn’t in closed-door training, the strongest title would have gone to me instead of a nameless nobody!”

Shoosh!

Just then, a figure whizzed past Jia Chengxiong. It moved at such a fast speed that Jia Chengxiong wondered if he was seeing things.
