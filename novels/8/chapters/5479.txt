Chapter 5479: Invitation to the God Taboo Battlefield

“I am indeed from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,” Chu Feng replied.

“Which starfield?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“The Ancestral Martial Starfield,” Chu Feng honestly answered.

It was too easy for someone of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s stature to thoroughly investigate his background, so there was no point lying about it. Besides, he didn’t think that the latter intended to do anything detrimental to him.

“Very well.”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief nodded with a smile before heading out of the underground palace. Chu Feng followed him.

Both Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were waiting outside.

“Lord Father, are you done with your questions?” Long Chengyu asked.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Mm.” The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief nodded.

“Lord Father, I heard that you headed to the Seven Realms Galaxy for a meeting concerning God’s Era. Did you uncover anything new?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I’ll tell you more about it later,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

“Lord Father, have you already heard about… what happened earlier?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I have heard about it. Don’t worry, young friend Chu Feng is our Totem Dragon Clan’s guest. I won’t allow any of our clansmen to make things difficult for him,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said before flitting off.

“Lord Father returned just in time. It looks like everything will be fine, after all,” Long Chengyu said with a relieved smile, knowing that his father had headed off to placate Long Shengjun.

No matter what, his father was the current clan chief. Long Shengjun should let this matter go, even if it was just on his father’s account.

“Speaking of which, what did my father ask you?” Long Chengyu asked.

“He asked me which galaxy and starfield I’m from,” Chu Feng replied.

“Just that?” Long Chengyu was baffled.

“Yes, just that,” Chu Feng replied.

“Is there a need to be so secretive when asking such basic questions?” Long Chengyu was perplexed.

The three of them waited on the spot for the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief to return, but Long Suqing came over instead.

“Aunt, where’s my father?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Your father is attending to other matters. Don’t worry, he has already settled Long Shengjun. That old thing shouldn’t do anything to Chu Feng anymore. However, he still harbors a grudge regarding the premature opening of the Armory Hall. He requested the premature opening of the Martial Skill Hall’s God Taboo Battlefield in compensation,” Long Suqing replied.

“He wants to open the God Taboo Battlefield? But it isn’t time yet. Is it possible to open it prematurely?” Long Chengyu asked.

“It is possible to do so, but only with Lord Clan Chief’s authority. Furthermore, the God Taboo Battlefield opened with Lord Clan Chief’s authority will be different from those before. The difficulty would be much higher. However, there are benefits too. For instance, there will surely be a God Taboo Martial Skill there,” Long Suqing said.

“A God Taboo Martial Skill?” Long Chengyu was excited to hear that, but he quickly recalled something and asked, “But what if we fail to obtain the God Taboo Martial Skill? Will it dissipate?”

“Yes, the God Taboo Martial Skill will permanently disappear if we fail to obtain it,” Long Suqing replied.

“It looks like a lot is at stake here. I’m surprised that I never heard of this before,” Long Chengyu said excitedly.

“There are only so few times that we can open the God Taboo Battlefield with the clan chief’s authority. By the time our Totem Dragon Clan took possession of it, there were only three opportunities remaining. Our first clan chief used it twice, but no one was able to acquire the God Taboo Martial Skills,” Long Suqing lamented.

“Weren’t the juniors of that era rather formidable too? All of them failed?” Long Chengyu was surprised to hear that.

As a Totem Dragon Clansman, he knew that the Totem Dragon Clan was at its strongest back in the era of the first clan chief. Both the elders and the juniors were extremely formidable.

“That’s why the first clan chief strictly forbade the opening of the God Taboo Battlefield using the clan chief’s authority unless 4 rank five Half-God level juniors appear in the same era,” Long Suqing said.

“In other words, the authority can only be used one last time?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Yes,” Long Suqing replied with a nod.

“That’s quite a lot to shoulder.” Long Chengyu felt a little stressed.

“We haven’t met the requirements of the first clan chief,” Long Muxi remarked.

She, too, was feeling stressed, as this was their final chance.

“That’s true, but your generation is also the most talented one in the history of our Totem Dragon Clan. It’d be unfair to restrict you by the requirements imposed by a past generation. Besides, in terms of your ability to control our bloodline, you have already met the standard,” Long Suqing said.

Long Muxi fell silent.

Long Suqing turned to Chu Feng and said, “Young friend Chu Feng, our clan chief invites you to enter the God Taboo Battlefield too.”

“Is Chu Feng allowed to enter too?” Long Chengyu and Long Muxi blurted out.

Such a thing had never happened before. The God Taboo Battlefield had always been restricted to only Totem Dragon Clansmen.

“Your father has permitted Chu Feng to enter too, but there is a condition. If he captures the God Taboo Martial Skill, he must hand it over to our clan. In other words, he will be doing us a favor instead. What do you think, young friend Chu Feng? Are you interested in entering the God Taboo Battlefield?” Long Suqing asked.

“Even if not for the generous gift I have just received, I’d be more than willing to do whatever I can for the Totem Dragon Clan on the account of Brother Chengyu and Miss Muxi. May I ask what kind of place the God Taboo Battlefield is?” Chu Feng asked.

He wanted to know more details about the God Taboo Battlefield.
