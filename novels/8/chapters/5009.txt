Chapter 5009: True Dragon Chessboard

The Dragon Spring needed additional processing before it could be served, so they had to wait a while after paying. So, Chu Feng turned his sights toward a painting hanging on the wall of the wooden hut.

It was five meters in length and one meter in height, but its content was uninterpretable. There was a peculiar aesthetic to it, but it was impossible to make out anything from it.

There were a group of people gathered in front of the painting. One of them was an old man who gave off a feeling of unfathomable depth.

It wasn’t just a pretense. It was the disposition that only experts who had reached a certain cultivation level would emanate.

Chu Feng guessed that the elder was a Half-God level cultivator.

Aside from the old man, the others gathered around the painting were all juniors. The tokens on their waists showed that they were from Heavenwind Sword Sect.

From their interactions with the painting, Chu Feng learned that the painting could be dissected and moved around. Those juniors were discussing intensely with each other while moving the painting around, trying to make out something meaningful from it.

There were four words written above the painting—True Dragon Chessboard.

“True Dragon Chessboard? Why is it called a chessboard when it’s a painting?” Chu Feng murmured in confusion.

It might appear that way to you, but that’s actually a chess puzzle. It’s said that there’s a chess puzzle in every Dragon Breath Spring Chamber, and anyone who successfully deciphers it will receive a Dragon Breath Token. It’s just that no one has deciphered the chess puzzle to date,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

“What use does the Dragon Breath Token have?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know either,” the Netherworld Envoy replied.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng began examining the chess puzzle intently, even resorting to his Heaven’s Eye for it. Under the scrutiny of Heaven’s Eye, the chess puzzle began taking on a different appearance.

Its jumbled appearance began reshaping to reveal another form.

Chu Feng got a feeling that it was originally a complete painting, but it was sliced into many parts and jumbled up. Nevertheless, a world spiritist like Chu Feng could figure out how to reassemble it with just a single glance.

The painting would depict a domineering massive dragon in its complete form. That would explain why it was called the True Dragon Chessboard.

“Would the chessboard be considered deciphered if I could put it together to form a complete image?” Chu Feng asked.

“Indeed. Young master, are you interested in giving it a try?” one of the waiters asked.

The waiter actively encouraged the customers present to attempt deciphering the chessboard.

“Is it that simple?” Chu Feng asked.

It was far too easy for him to reassemble the True Dragon Chessboard with the help of Heaven’s Eye, to the extent that Chu Feng thought that it was unrealistic.

“Simple? What nonsense is that fellow saying?”

Innumerable eyes turned toward Chu Feng before snorting in disdain. In particular, the juniors from the Heavenwind Sword Sect gathered in front of the True Dragon Chessboard spoke awfully repulsive words.

Even the waiter who had encouraged Chu Feng to give it a try broke out in a smile.

“Customer, it’s true that all you have to do is to piece the True Dragon Chessboard together into a complete picture, but it is no easy feat to pull that off. Rumor has it that the complete painting depicts an imposing true dragon, but are you able to see any traces of the true dragon on the chessboard right now? If not, how do you intend to piece the painting together?” the waiter teased.

Chu Feng couldn’t help but wonder if there was something deeper to the True Dragon Chessboard because it was simply too easy for him to piece the painting together with his Heaven’s Eye.

One must know that he was in the Totem Galaxy right now! In fact, there were already quite a few experts gathered in this Dragon Breath Spring Chamber.

It was hard to believe that they couldn’t see through the chessboard when Chu Feng could do it so easily. That made him wonder if there was something deeper to the painting that he was missing out on here.

“Elder, are you able to discern anything from the True Dragon Chessboard?” Chu Feng asked the Netherworld Envoy.

While Chu Feng harbored deep hostility toward the Netherworld Envoy at the very start, he soon realized through their interactions that even though the Netherworld Envoy was an obstinate man fixated on his ideals, he wasn’t someone who easily took the lives of others.

Furthermore, the Netherworld Envoy had been rather respectful to him thus far, so Chu Feng eventually chose to return the respect and address the other party as ‘elder’ too.

“I’m afraid not. Chu Feng, did you notice something?” the Netherworld Envoy asked.

“You can’t see the dragon on the painting?” Chu Feng asked.

“Dragon? This young master over here, you’re able to see a dragon?”

A lady from the Heavenwind Sword Sect immediately turned around and asked Chu Feng.

This lady wasn’t particularly beautiful, but she carried an air of valiance. From their conversation, Chu Feng could tell that the lady possessed considerable standing amongst the juniors of the Heavenwind Sword Sect.

She appeared to be truly interested in the True Dragon Chessboard. In fact, the other juniors were only attempting to decipher the chessboard due to her interest in it.

That was why she turned around and asked Chu Feng about it upon hearing his words.

However, before Chu Feng could answer, a pale-faced man next to her sneered, “Junior, can’t you tell that he’s a braggart? Just look at him! He’s obviously someone who lacks capability! There are many scammers like him out there in the world. You can’t be so trusting of them!”

The lady thought that those words made sense, so she turned around and continued studying the True Dragon Chessboard.

At the same time, a voice transmission arrived into Chu Feng’s ears.

“Brat, stop showing off! Are you trying to catch my junior’s attention? You better drop that idea, or else I’ll purge your sect!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Needless to say, the threatening voice transmission came from the pale-faced man.

Chu Feng was no pushover either. He wouldn’t tolerate others blatantly threatening him like that. Thus, he stood up and said, “I’m only voicing out my opinion. Yet, you’re threatening to purge my sect just because your junior asked me a question? Hah! Are you planning to massacre everyone who speaks even a single word to your junior?”

Chu Feng’s words were spoken out loud, and they immediately caught everyone’s attention.

The pale-faced man also didn’t expect Chu Feng to confront him straight on, and it left him flustered.

“What nonsense are you spouting? Is there something wrong with your head?!” he bellowed.

The pale-faced man wouldn’t admit to secretly threatening Chu Feng.

“Hah! I thought that you must be pretty formidable to dare talk about purging my sect, but it turns out that you’re just another coward who dares not to own up to his own words,” Chu Feng sighed.

“Who are you saying is a coward? You’re asking to be crippled!”

That man flew into a state of rage. He released his oppressive might, revealing his rank five Martial Exalted level cultivation.

“Customers, the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber is not a place to cause trouble. If you continue disturbing the other guests, we’ll have no choice but to evict you from the premises,” one of the waiters spoke up.

Chu Feng could sense an aura that surpassed Martial Exalted level from the waiter.

Despite the waiter’s unassuming appearance, it turned out that he was actually a formidable expert.

“Chu Feng, forget it. We’re here to taste the Dragon Spring, not to cause trouble,” the Netherworld Envoy said as he pulled Chu Feng back onto his seat.

“Don’t disturb others.”

At the same time, the unfathomable elder from the Heavenwind Sword Sect also spoke up.

The pale-faced man held his tongue, but he shot Chu Feng a threatening glare before turning away. It was an indication that he wasn’t planning to let things rest just like that.

As displeased as Chu Feng was, he could tell that it would be unwise to come to blows in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber, so he could only let things rest for the time being.

“Customers, there’s no need to lose your temper. Here, have a taste of our Dragon Spring.”

The waiter who took their Dragon Spring Coins earlier soon returned with two bowls of Dragon Spring.
