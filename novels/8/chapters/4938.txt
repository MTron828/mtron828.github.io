Chapter 4938: The Strongest Junior World Spiritist

“Be my guest!”

Shengguang Baimei gritted his teeth, but he knew that he couldn’t blow his top. He wouldn’t be a match for the Zhuge Clan within their defensive barrier, so he had no choice but to hold it in.

It was just incredibly stifling for him to have to suppress his anger.&nbsp;

The ones who were being unreasonable here were the Zhuge Clan. They were the ones reneging on their promise.

“Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, I hope that you can honor your promise. As long as you allow Chu Feng to access the legacy formation, I’m willing to offer this treasure as a gift to your Zhuge Clan.”

Princess Xiaoxiao suddenly stood forward and spoke up. There was a pearl-sized black fruit that emanated a herbal fragrance sitting on her palm.&nbsp;

Chu Feng, Daoist Niantian, and Shengguang Baimei narrowed their eyes upon seeing the fruit. The eyes of those from the Zhuge Clan lit up in excitement.&nbsp;

That black fruit was no ordinary fruit. It harnessed an incredible amount of spirit power within it.

In other words, it was a world spiritist treasure!

Just like how cultivators had forbidden medicine to raise their cultivation, that black fruit could be described as a forbidden medicine for world spiritists. And its effects didn’t just stop there.&nbsp;

In any case, it was just extremely useful for world spiritists.&nbsp;

“Princess Xiaoxiao, there’s no need for you to go this far. It’s only right for the Zhuge Clan to fulfill their promise. We don’t have to strike a deal with them,” Master Yin Ren said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He then turned to the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief and said, “Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, we have known each other for many years. I hope that you can fulfill your promise, or else I fear that our relationship will have to come to an end here.”

His words were sharp and his attitude severe.&nbsp;

However, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief merely chuckled in response.

“Master Yin Ren, it saddens me to hear such words from you. We have known each other for so many years. However, it’s not that I want to break my promise but you have really remembered it wrongly. How could I possibly break my promise to you?”

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief revealed a conflicted look before eventually turning his sights toward the black fruit sitting on Princess Xiaoxiao’s palm.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, that must be the Divine Spirit Tree’s Black Fruit. It’s incredibly difficult to find that. May I take a look at it?”

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief wanted to verify the authenticity of the black fruit.

“Don’t worry, it’s real.”

Princess Xiaoxiao tossed the black fruit over.&nbsp;

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief received the black fruit and infused his spirit power into it. Soon, a satisfied smile emerged on his wrinkly face.&nbsp;

“Princess Xiaoxiao does have incredible connections. To think that you would be able to obtain such an amazing treasure,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief remarked.

“I heard that the Zhuge Clan has offered a high price for it in the market but haven’t been able to acquire it yet. I’ll give it to you in exchange for a chance for Chu Feng to enter the legacy formation,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.&nbsp;

“Princess Xiaoxiao, our Zhuge Clan is indeed looking for the Divine Spirit Tree’s Black Fruit. I’m willing to give young friend Chu Feng a chance if you’re willing to give it to us. As long as he defeats one of our juniors in a 1-on-1 duel, we’ll allow him to enter our legacy formation. However, if he loses, I’ll be keeping the black fruit. Do give it some thought,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, don’t you think you’re going too far? You were the one who reneged on our promise. Our princess was kind enough to offer such a valuable treasure to you, yet you still dare to come up with such conditions? You must be really looking down on me,” Master Yin Ren spat out angrily.&nbsp;

“Master Yin Ren, I don’t know what to say. You did win the duel, but you have remembered our promise wrongly. How about this? Bring your disciple here next time, and I’ll definitely allow your disciple to enter the legacy formation. It’s just that young friend Chu Feng isn’t your disciple, so I can’t allow him to enter.&nbsp;

“If young friend Chu Feng really wishes to enter the legacy formation, I can give him a chance in view of Princess Xiaoxiao’s Divine Spirit Tree’s Black Fruit. Just like what I’ve said earlier, as long as he defeats a junior of our Zhuge Clan in a spirit power duel and proves himself worthy, I’ll grant him entry.&nbsp;

“I think that the conditions I have laid out are perfectly fair. If you aren’t satisfied with it, we can forget all about it. Princess Xiaoxiao, I do desire your black fruit, but the rules can’t be broken. Keep it well,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said with a helpless voice.

“Chu Feng.”

Princess Xiaoxiao turned to Chu Feng to seek his opinion.

“What kind of duel will it be, and who am I going to face?” Chu Feng asked.

“It looks like young friend Chu Feng is interested. What about Princess Xiaoxiao?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Get your people here and clarify the rules of the duel first,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.

“Very well. Call Feiluan here!” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief shouted, and an elder quickly left the hall.

Princess Xiaoxiao’s face darkened upon hearing those words.&nbsp;

Zhuge Feiluan was the most talented junior of the Zhuge Clan. Princess Xiaoxiao had long heard of his strength. Chu Feng would have stood a decent chance against anyone else from the Zhuge Clan, but it wouldn’t be that easy if his opponent was Zhuge Feiluan.

“Chu Feng, you have to be careful. Even though Zhuge Feiluan is rumored to be on par with Gongsun Yuntian in terms of world spiritist techniques, in truth, the two of them have sparred on many occasions but the latter has never won a single time before.

“Zhuge Feiluan isn’t just the most talented junior of the Zhuge Clan. He’s also the strongest junior world spiritist of our Nine Souls Galaxy. He’s definitely not one to be made light of. What’s the maximum you can handle with your current spirit power?” Princess Xiaoxiao asked via voice transmission.

“I’m at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation. If we’re competing in terms of absolute spirit power, I should be able to barely deal with a rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist. That would be my limit.&nbsp;

“If Zhuge Feiluan has already reached rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to defeat him regardless of the duel formation,” Chu Feng replied.&nbsp;

“I understand. As long as Zhuge Clan’s rules aren’t overboard and Zhuge Feiluan is only at rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, I’ll accept their conditions,” Princess Xiaoxiao replied.

“Thank you,” Chu Feng replied via voice transmission.

Even though Princess Xiaoxiao had taken in Xian Miaomiao’s soul, she didn’t do it voluntarily. On top of that, she was sparing no effort to help him right now. For that, Chu Feng was grateful to her.&nbsp;

Chu Feng wasn’t fond of the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief. He had met many people over the years, so how could he not be able to tell that the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief was lying through his teeth?

It was just that there was nothing he could do about it. The Zhuge Clan had their defensive barrier, and they didn’t seem to be intimidated by the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. That complicated things.&nbsp;

Chu Feng was confident that he would be able to defeat them in due time, but he wanted to save Xian Miaomiao as soon as possible. For that, he had no choice but to go along with the Zhuge clan even though they were being unreasonable.

Soon, the elder returned with a suave young man.

Needless to say, that young man was Zhuge Feiluan.

Zhuge Feiluan was quite a respectful person. The first thing he did upon entering the hall was to greet those in the room. He didn’t just greet Master Yin Ren and Princess Xiaoxiao; he was respectful to Shengguang Baimei, Daoist Niantian, and even Chu Feng too.&nbsp;

His earnest attitude didn’t seem to be a pretense.

Chu Feng had a good first impression of him. He could tell that Zhuge Feiluan and Gongsun Yuntian were entirely different people, so he chose to return the greeting respectfully too.&nbsp;

“Feiluan, come here and tell everyone your current level of spirit power,” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said.&nbsp;

“Brother Chu Feng, I’m a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. I’ve reached rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation. May I know what’s your current level?” Zhuge Feiluan asked.&nbsp;
