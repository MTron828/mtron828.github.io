Chapter 4843: All-encompassing Net

“Kui An, did you notice something?”

Lord Long Xie noticed that something was amiss with Kui An and called out to it. Upon hearing the call, Kui An quickly headed back to the monstrous old man’s side, not daring to waste any time.

“Lord Long Xie, I’ve communicated with the Heavenly Lightning Bugs and found out why they dared not to approach Chu Feng,” Kui An reported.

“What’s the reason? Don’t beat around the bush and get straight to the point,” Lord Long Xie ordered.

“It’s not because of that child’s talent. The Heavenly Lightning Bugs noticed an incredibly powerful protective formation hidden in that child’s body. Lord Long Xie, you should be well aware of how the Heavenly Lightning Bugs assesses an individual’s talent.

“They are afraid that the protective formation might view their intrusion into Chu Feng’s body as an act of aggression and claim their lives,” Kui An said.

“Protective formation? There’s actually a protective formation that the Heavenly Lightning Bugs fear?” the monstrous old man looked at Chu Feng as he asked.

A verdant glow shimmered from his eyes, allowing him to see through everything. It was a special observation skill that he possessed.

However, after a quick look, he retracted his gaze and sighed helplessly. He was unable to sense the protective formation in Chu Feng’s body at all.

“Lord Long Xie, are you able to see the protective formation?” the monstrous old man asked.

“I’m unable to see it either. It seems like it’ll only show itself when Chu Feng’s life is in danger. It looks like I’ve underestimated Chu Feng. To think that someone has planted such a formidable protective formation in his body!” Lord Long Xie remarked.

He turned to Kui An afterward and said, “Kui An, tell the Heavenly Lightning Bugs to continue with the test. I’ll ensure their safety even if the protective formation triggers.”

Kui An quickly did as it was told, but it soon returned once more.

“Lord Long Xie, the Heavenly Lightning Bugs refused,” Kui An reported with a troubled look on its face.

“How dare those Heavenly Lightning Bugs defy Lord Long Xie’s will? Tell them that they can either do as they are ordered to or else I’ll end their lives before they die to the protective formation!” the monstrous old man roared.

“Forget it. Those are creatures forged by Milord,” Lord Long Xie shook his head and said.

He directed his claws toward the Heavenly Lightning Bugs, and the latter flew into his grasp one by one—or to be more exact, they were flying into a formation in his claws.

It was a formation reminiscent of a Cosmos Sack, just that it was embedded inside Long Xie’s claws. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Lord Long Xie, what do we do now? Should I try to remove the protective formation from Chu Feng’s body?” the monstrous old man asked.

“Forget it.” Lord Long Xie shook his head.

The monstrous old man was surprised by how easily Lord Long Xie was giving up here. He asked, “Lord Long Xie, are you unable to do anything about that protective formation either?”

He was shocked because he knew that Lord Long Xie was the kind of person who wouldn’t rest until he achieved what he wanted, and his overwhelming power usually allowed him to do so. The only plausible reason why Lord Long Xie was backing down here was that he wasn’t confident of achieving success here.

If even Lord Long Xie had chosen to surrender here... just how powerful must that protective formation be?!

But as soon as the monstrous old man said those words, he felt a pair of cold eyes gazing down on him from the sky.

“What nonsense are you speaking? Even if I’m unable to sense the protective formation, how could I possibly fear it? I don’t know who’s protecting Chu Feng, but could he possibly be stronger than me?

“I just don’t want to touch the protective formation because it seems like a lot seems to have been put into the formation. Without a doubt, it was left behind by someone who cares deeply for Chu Feng. As much as I want to test Chu Feng’s talent, I don’t want to ruin such a protective formation,” Lord Long Xie grunted in annoyance.

The monstrous old man trembled at Lord Long Xie’s wrath and quickly lowered his head subserviently.

“Yes, Lord Long Xie is right. How could a mere protective formation possibly trouble you? I must have been out of my mind to even think that way!”

“Don’t bother fawning on me!” Lord Long Xie harrumphed in response.

It didn’t seem like he was intending to settle the scores with the monstrous old man for underestimating him earlier. He turned toward Chu Feng, and those eyes that were so cold that it made the monstrous old man shudder were swiftly replaced with admiration.

“Since the Heavenly Lightning Bugs won’t work, it looks like I can only go for an alternative. Let’s see just how talented you are!”

A white glowing sphere materialized in Lord Long Xie’s massive dragon claws.

“That’s the All-encompassing Net!”

The monstrous old man, humanoid monster, and Kui An were shocked to see the white sphere.

The All-encompassing Net wasn’t a tool to gauge a person’s talent. Rather, it was used to find talents. It was just that it had the additional function of assessing the captured individual’s talent.

Its accuracy in evaluating Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline wasn’t as accurate as using the Heavenly Lightning Bugs, but it was still much better than most other evaluation methods.

Similar to the Heavenly Lightning Bugs, the All-encompassing Net was also a treasure forged by their master, making it an exclusive item.

It was just that the Heavenly Lightning Bugs possessed sentience and could be used over and over again, but the All-encompassing Net only had one use, making it even more valuable than the Heavenly Lightning Bugs.

Yet, Lord Long Xie was willing to use it in order to gauge Chu Feng’s talent. It showed just how highly he thought of Chu Feng!
