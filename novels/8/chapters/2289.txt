Chapter 2289 - Unable To Tell Good From Bad

Chu Feng was very surprised by the declaration from the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster.

At the same time, he also felt very grateful. After all, the Ying Heavenly Clan would not be easy to deal with at all. For the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall to be willing to help him like this was most definitely an enormous grace and kindness.

However, Chu Feng had already decided that he would take care of his own things himself. He did not wish to implicate the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.

Furthermore, even if the two of them might be able to handle the Ying Heavenly Clan by joining hands, Chu Feng’s actual enemy was the Infant Soul Sect.

Although Chu Feng did not know much regarding the Infant Soul Sect right now, he felt that, according to what his father had told him, the Infant Soul Sect was very powerful, and most definitely not something the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall could compare to.

Thus, Chu Feng absolutely could not allow others to know that he possessed an extraordinary relationship with the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall. Else, once Chu Feng made even stronger enemies, he might really end up implicating the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.

“Seniors, this Chu Feng appreciates your kind intentions.”

“However, it remains that I am the one who has provoked this calamity. As such, I should be the one to shoulder it.”

“I do not wish to rely on others. Furthermore, I am part of neither the Sunset Cloud Valley nor the Three Stars Hall. I do not wish for the people of the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall to end up dying because of me,” Chu Feng said.

“Little friend Chu Feng...” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master and the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster opened their mouths in unison. They seemed to be wanting to urge Chu Feng against it.

“Seniors, this is my personal matter. I truly do not want seniors to be involved. If seniors continue to insist, I, Chu Feng will take my leave right now,” Chu Feng stood up.

“Eh...” The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster and the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master were both at a loss. They did not expect that Chu Feng would refuse their kind intentions like that.

“Bang~~~”

A loud sound was heard. The table before Kou Kang was shattered into pieces. With a furious expression on his face, he pointed at Chu Feng and shouted, “Chu Feng! You are truly one that is unable to differentiate good from bad! My master and Lord Valley Master are willing to help you out of their kind intentions. And yet, you actually refuse to appreciate their kindness?! Who do you think you are?! Apologize to my master immediately!”

“Shut up!” However, who would’ve thought that right after Kou Kang’s words were spoken, the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster would coldly glare him down.

At that moment, Kou Kang felt as if he had fallen down into a bottomless abyss. He was feeling truly ice-cold.

He was only trying to stand out for his master to retrieve his honor. Yet, never did he expect that his master would instead shout him down.

How could he possibly tolerate this? Kou Kang truly had the feeling of wanting to die.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you have your own decisions to make. We will not be able to force you. However, we also possess our own determination. Since you do not wish to continue to discuss this subject, we shall no longer talk about it,” The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster said with a smile. He had actually made a concession.

Although he had made a concession, his intent was also very clearly stated. While Chu Feng could refuse their intentions to help him, they would insist on helping him. The reason for that was because there was nothing that Chu Feng could do regarding their decisions.

“Senior, I have already made my decision. Farewell.”

However, even though the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster had made a concession, Chu Feng still resolutely turned around and began to walk toward the door of the palace.

Chu Feng’s actions could truly be said to be excessive.

Chu Feng was doing all of this deliberately. He wanted to make the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master and the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster give up on helping him. He wanted them to know that they would not be able to move him, nor would they be able to entice him regardless of what they might do.

Even though his actions today might be extremely drastic, although his behavior might be extremely undiscriminating and might even cause a misunderstanding or grudges, Chu Feng still felt that he had to do it.

After all... he was only doing this for the sake of the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall. He was secretly protecting them.

“Chu Feng!!!”

Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu were all stunned by Chu Feng’s departure.

To the two of them, it was an enormously pleasant surprise that the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall were willing to help Chu Feng. It would be one thing for Chu Feng to refuse their goodwill. Yet, he actually even disrespected the two leaders in such a manner. The two of them were truly confused by Chu Feng’s actions.

As for Kou Kang, he had managed to grasp an extremely rare opportunity to retaliate against Chu Feng. He readjusted his frame of mind, and then spoke to the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster in a resentful manner.

“Master, that Chu Feng is truly one that is unable to differentiate good from bad. His upbringing is simply lacking. Master, why would you want to help him like this?”

“What do you know?” However, even now, Kou Kang was still berated by his master.

After that, the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster ignored Kou Kang and looked to the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master and Su Jingrui, “What do you two think?”

“That boy Chu Feng does not want to implicate us. However, if we insist on helping him, he will still appreciate our kindness,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“Although I have only just met that boy, and do not know him well, I truly feel that he is a brat of character. It has been many years since I’ve last seen a brat like him, much less one as talented as he is,” The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster said.

“Your intention is that even if Chu Feng refuses to appreciate our kind intentions, we must still fight against the Ying Heavenly Clan?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked.

“For a rare genius like Chu Feng, if he is to mature, it will not only be beneficial to our Three Stars Hall and your Sunset Cloud Valley. He might even be an enormous assistance to our entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. We absolutely cannot allow the Ying Heavenly Clan to ruin him,” The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster said.

“In that case, things will be simple,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said with a light smile.

“That’s true. While the Ying Heavenly Clan is not one to be despised, they will still have to make careful consideration should our Three Stars Hall join hands with your Sunset Cloud Valley,” The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster said.

“Since that’s the case, let’s spread the news,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What do we say?” The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster asked.

“It’ll be that we will fight for Chu Feng, of course,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“Very well,” The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster revealed a smile.

At that moment, Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu were looking at one another. The two of them were completely baffled.

Chu Feng had clearly been extremely excessive earlier. Yet, their three lords were actually not angry. In fact, they even decided to continue to insist on helping Chu Feng. This caused both Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu to feel disbelief.

When the two girls were already feeling like that, one could easily imagine what sort of expression Kou Kang had on his face just then. It was truly as ugly as ugly could be.

However, there was nothing he could do. After all... he was simply unable to interrupt the conversation.

Afterwards, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall began to spread the news.

They had declared the truth of Ying Liangchen massacring the Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters, and then Chu Feng avenging them. With that, they caped themselves with a cloak of righteousness.

After that, they declared that they would uphold justice, and pledge their lives to protect Chu Feng. If the Ying Heavenly Clan were to insist on killing Chu Feng, they would wage war against the Ying Heavenly Clan.

Luyang’s Pavilion. This formerly glorious location had been completely ruined since the day Chu Luyang had been killed. Many of the experts that were once part of Luyang’s Pavilion had left it. What remained was merely a bunch of scattered remnants. They no longer carried the glory of their golden age.

However, at that moment, several tens of grand characters appeared at Luyang’s Pavilion.

There were men and women among them. There were extremely old elderly people, as well as youthful members of the younger generation. Although those people were of both high and low cultivations, no one dared to be disrespectful toward them.

The reason for that was because they all possessed a common identity. That is, they were members of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

They had all arrived for the sake of Chu Luyang’s death.
