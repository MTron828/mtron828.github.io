Chapter 3504 - Strange Scream

“Senior, when will we activate this grand formation?” Chu Feng asked the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“We cannot activate this formation rashly. We must wait until the Black-feathered Specter reveals itself,” said the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Senior, how do we know when that Black-feathered Specter will reveal itself?” As Chu Feng asked those words, a sudden thought popped into his mind, “Could it be... to wait till someone perishes?”

“Mn,” nodded the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He had a very helpless expression. Thus, he added, “Although that is also not what I wish for, it is the only method to determine whether or not the Black-feathered Specter is within our Tantai Heavenly Clan.”

Chu Feng felt that this method was rather cruel. Regardless of who might end up suffering the calamity of the Black-feathered Specter, it would still be someone from the Tantai Heavenly Clan that would suffer.

That said, Chu Feng was able to understand the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. After all, the grand formation could only be activated once. If they were to fail to capture the Black-feathered Specter after the grand formation was activated, and discover that the Black-feathered Specter was not in their Tantai Heavenly Clan, the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen would continue to suffer at the hands of the Black-feathered Specter. At that time, the gains would truly not make up for the losses.

Although Chu Feng felt that it was cruel, he knew that this was the only method available.

As a man, one must make a decision in times of need.

Sacrifices were unavoidable.

As the chief of a clan, one must make the correct decision in times of crisis even more so.

Although Chu Feng felt that it was cruel, he was also able to admire the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s resolution.

“In that case, how are we to know when a clansman is met with the Black-feathered Specter’s calamity?”

“If we cannot detect the death of that clansman the very instant it happens, everything will be futile,” said Wuming Xingyun.

“Milord, you can rest assured about that. For the sake of this day, our clan has prepared for ten thousand years. Our clan had already set up a spirit formation long ago. Once that spirit formation is activated, should a clansman perish, we’ll be immediately be able to detect it.”

“Besides, although I had ordered the returning warships to slow their return, they will still arrive tomorrow at midday.”

“Thus, tonight would be the optimal time to act. Let us hope that the Black-feathered Specter will appear on time. Otherwise... we will have no choice but to put off capturing and killing that Black-feathered Specter,” said the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“If that’s the case, we’ll have no choice but to wait. Clan Chief Tantai, is it possible to activate the formation core first so that we can experience the might of a God-cloak World Spiritist?” Wuming Xingyun asked.

As a world spiritist, he knew very well that a spirit formation from a God-cloak World Spiritist would contain profound mysteries unknown to them. If he was able to comprehend those profound mysteries, it would provide enormous assistance toward his future progress in world spirit techniques.

A God-cloak World Spiritist’s spirit formation was truly rare in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Thus, this could be said to be a very rare opportunity.

“Milord, I am truly sorry. That expert senior mentioned that the formation core can only be entered by our Tantai Heavenly Clansmen,” the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Wuming Xingyun frowned slightly upon hearing those words. He was able to tell that it was the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief that didn’t want them to enter the formation core.

Thus, in a slightly displeased manner, he said, “Since you had no intention of having us enter the formation core, why bother bringing us here?”

“Milord, we still do not know what sort of power that Black-feathered Specter possesses. However, once this demon suppression formation is activated, that Black-feathered Specter will definitely starting wreaking havoc. At that time, this place will be the safest place to be,” said the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Mn,” Although Wuming Xingyun was feeling somewhat unreconciled, he had no choice but to accept that justification. After all, as the proverb said, a guest should do as the master says. As this was the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s territory; even if he was unhappy about being denied entrance, he must still respect their wishes.

Afterwards, the entrance to the palace opened. Only the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and two Supreme Elders entered. All of the other experts from the Tantai Heavenly Clan stayed outside the palace like Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun.

They all began to wait.

As they were always training, martial cultivators would always feel that time passed very quickly.

However, at that moment, Chu Feng and the others felt something different. They felt that time passed very slowly.

Such waiting was a sort of torment.

Fortunately, although it was tortuous, time still passed.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, a loud sound was heard. Following that, the ground started to tremble violently.

At that moment, Chu Feng and the others, who were resting with their eyes closed, immediately opened their eyes and looked up.

Even though they were before the formation core of the grand demon suppression formation, even though one could not see that place from the outside at all, the observation techniques of Chu Feng and the others were all effective should they be looking out from that place.

Thus, Chu Feng and the others were all able to clearly see that an enormous barrier was currently taking shape in the sky above the Tantai Heavenly Clan. It was covering the entire Tantai Heavenly Clan, sealing it off.

There were countless spirit formation runes and symbols on the barrier. They seemed like a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses all standing in formation.

“It’s begun.”

Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun looked to one another.

The sky had only just darkened. The darkening of the sky was actually caused by the activation of that god-level demon suppression formation.

The grand demon suppression formation had activated sooner than they had anticipated. However, since it had activated, it most likely meant that they had caught traces of the Black-feathered Specter.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, a beam of light appeared at the peak of the grand formation that sealed off the sky. That beam of light was extremely bright and imposing. Like a sharp blade, it shot straight from the sky toward the northwestern region of the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

At the same time, the Evil Suppression, Demon Repression title plate atop the palace that served as the formation core started to emit a faint light.

At that moment, the righteous aura emitted by the formation core immediately grew several hundred times more intense.

Chu Feng knew that the grand demon suppression formation had been successfully activated.

“Roar~~~”

Suddenly, an incomparably piercing scream was heard. That voice was so ear-piercing that even Chu Feng and the others, who were deep in the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s underground, were able to hear it with clarity.

That scream sounded extremely strange, and was filled with wickedness. Hearing that, one could not help but feel uneasy, causing one’s blood to run cold. Even Chu Feng and the others were no exception.

The direction where that scream was heard was precisely the direction where the grand demon suppression formation’s beam of light had descended upon. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It’s the Black-feathered Specter! Success! The grand demon suppression formation has captured that monster!”

The Tantai Heavenly Clan’s elders were all endlessly excited. Relief filled their faces.

“No, something’s amiss,” However, Chu Feng was frowning. There was an alarmed expression on his face.

“What’s amiss?” The Tantai Heavenly Clan’s elders looked to Chu Feng in a confused manner.

“This voice... it doesn’t sound like a scream. Rather... it sounds more like laughter,” said Chu Feng.
