Chapter 4653: Graveyard Prison

A figure had silently appeared in the hall, and before that figure spoke, Chu Feng, Yu Sha, and Eggy didn’t notice him at all.

This figure was an old man towering over them at a height of 13 meters, and his physique was amazingly brawny. On top of that, he was wearing a set of black armor and had a sword slotted by his waist, looking quite awe-inspiring. If not for his white hair and wrinkled face, no one would have thought that he was an old man.

However, his eyes were blank, and he emanated a powerful aura.

He was an Asura Evil Spirit, and a formidable one at that!

Not only was he powerful, but his armor and sword were obviously much more exquisite than Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian’s. This showed that he had quite an extraordinary identity.

“Damn it!”

Seeing this evil spirit, Eggy unhesitatingly charged forth with the Death God’s Edge in hand.

Pah!

But as soon as Eggy came close, the old man reached out and grabbed Eggy’s Death God’s Edge in a grasp. A pained look appeared on Eggy’s face as she tried her best to struggle free, but it was futile.

It was clear that Eggy had been restrained by the old man’s powers.

This evil spirit old man was far stronger than Eggy!

The current circumstances brought a tight frown to Yu Sha’s face too. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

One must know that Eggy was their greatest backing at the moment. If even Eggy was no match for him, there was nothing they could do at all.

“Be it the night of the harshest land battered with hail, a new day will still arise eventually.”

It was then that Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.

It was the passcode the Wretched Black Demon told him!

“You were sent by Black Demon?”

Hearing the passcode, the old man looked at Chu Feng once more, but his ferocious glare had mellowed out significantly.

Seeing this, Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief. In truth, he was only giving it a try.

The old man was simply too forceful, making him seem not like the person receiving them. So, Chu Feng was rather surprised that he actually got it right.

“Elder, I was indeed sent here by the Wretched Black Demon,” Chu Feng said with a deep bow.

Hearing those words, the evil spirit old man released Eggy before asking, “Are you the only one? Aren’t there supposed to be two?”

Those words verified the old man’s identity as the one who was receiving Chu Feng over at the Asura Graveyard. It was just that Chu Feng didn’t expect their receiver to be an Asura Evil Spirit, especially not such a powerful one.

“Elder, something happened earlier, so there’s only me now,” Chu Feng replied.

“Take your world spirit back to your World Spirit Space, then follow me. Remember, if I don’t talk to you, you shouldn’t say anything either.”

The old man warned sternly.

Chu Feng quickly put Eggy and Yu Sha into his World Spirit Space before following the old man as if his guard.

After leaving the hall, Chu Feng found himself standing before an incredibly beautiful world. There were a blue sky and white clouds above him, and there were lush mountains and clear streams not too far in the distance. As it turned out, this hall was built upon one of these mountains.

He was in a boundless world where he couldn’t see the end.

This was different from the Asura Graveyard he has imagined in his head. He thought that the Asura Graveyard would be as terrifying as hell, but his surroundings looked no different from the world of cultivation.

“Is it disguised under a formation? I’m actually unable to see through it at all. This must be the doing of a formidable world spirit. It looks like the ASura Graveyard is really no ordinary palace.”

Despite the beautiful scenery, Chu Feng knew deep down that this was just an illusion. After all, the Asura Graveyard was located deep underground, so how could there be a blue sky and clouds?

It was just that this formation was too strong that Chu Feng, despite knowing that it was fake, was unable to see through it.

Chu Feng followed the old man for a long distance, passing by numerous evil spirits along the way. These evil spirits were dressed in the same armor as Chu Feng, just that there was no sword slotted by their waist. Instead, they were holding onto a spear.

These evil spirits were standing neatly in place; even those who were flying were standing in some sort of formation.

Chu Feng could only think of one word to describe them—disciplined.

However, regardless of the rank of the evil spirits, as soon as they saw this old man, they would halt whatever they were doing and greet him. They called him ‘Lord Yunliang’.

From their respectful gaze, Chu Feng’s previous deduction was affirmed. The person who had received him, Lord Yunliang, was quite a notable figure in the Asura Graveyard. This sparked Chu Feng’s curiosity as to why someone of this old man’s standing would help the Wretched Black Demon steal something.

After all, this could be considered as an act of betrayal against the Asura Evil Spirits.

Could it be that he wasn’t a real evil spirit, and he was just disguising himself as one?

Chu Feng had a lot of doubts in mind, but he wasn’t in a good position to voice them out. Based on what he had seen thus far, this Lord Yunliang was a very cold person, perhaps unfriendly even.

Chu Feng didn’t like not being in control of the situation, and it left him feeling a little insecure. He didn’t even know where Lord Yunliang was bringing him to and what he was going to do next.

Thus, he bucked up his courage and asked through voice transmission, “Lord Yunliang, are we going to take the item now?”

Yet, as soon Chu Feng asked those words, Lord Yunliang suddenly halted his footsteps and turned to look at him. At that very moment, Chu Feng felt chills running down his spine.

Lord Yunliang’s gaze was extremely terrifying, carrying overwhelming murderous intent.

“Didn’t you hear what I told you earlier? Don’t speak or ask anything there. Just follow me and abide by my instructions. If you dare to speak a single word more, I’ll kill you right now,” Lord Yunliang replied sharply through voice transmission.

After this incident, Chu Feng dared not to ask anything at all. He obediently followed Lord Yunliang around. In the end, they arrived at an underground prison.

This underground prison was massive, incarcerating countless prisoners. Even at a single glance, Chu Feng could spot over 10,000 of them. Judging by the sheer size of the underground prison, there should at least be tens of millions of them in here.

The prisoners were all Asura Evil Spirits. These prisoners had their hands and legs shackled, and even their mouth was sealed using some sort of tool. They weren’t even allowed to speak at all, as if they had committed some sort of grievous crime.

Surprisingly, upon seeing Lord Yunliang, even the prisoners got to their feet and bowed to him.

However, Lord Yunliang didn’t pay them any heed. He continued heading straight on till he arrived at a tightly guarded cell.

This cell was a little unusual in the sense that it was made of a unique material, making the structure exceptionally resilient.

The guards protecting the cell, be it their attire or their aura, was not anything the other guards could match against.

From these details, it could be seen how important this cell was.

Upon seeing Lord Yunliang, the guards bowed deeply to him, but they showed no signs of opening the doors. It was only until Lord Yunliang took out a token with the words ‘Asura King’ inscribed on it that the guards finally opened the doors for him.

However, when the door opened, Chu Feng’s heart skipped a beat.

The person who was imprisoned within wasn’t an evil spirit but a cultivator.

There was no doubt about it. Her attire and appearance were that of a cultivator. And what was even more shocking was that this cultivator was someone whom Chu Feng recognized.

“Wang Yuxian?”

Chu Feng’s heart jolted in astonishment.

This person was the favored disciple of the renowned Lady of Dao Sea!

But how in the world was she here?
