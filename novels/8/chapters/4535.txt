Chapter 4535 - Not Quite The Same

“Young friend Chu Feng, you...”

Long Daozhi looked at Chu Feng. Confusion filled his eyes.

Surprising him, Chu Feng actually smiled before looking at the people of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.

“Your savior is here. What are you all still standing around for? Shouldn’t you quickly go and seek for help?”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect all soared into the sky at once and began to fly toward the entrance of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

None of the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City stopped them.

The reason for that was because they knew that they wouldn’t be able to stop them. All efforts were meaningless now. After all, the two most important people had already fled.

“We’re done for. We’re completely done for now.”

“With that Dian Kuang’s personality, he will definitely add venomous slanders and make false claims about us.”

“Why would it be like this? Why would the people from the Dragon Clan come to our Ancestral Martial Dragon City at such a time?”

“Could the Dragon Clan really dote on the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect so much that they’ll stick around them to protect them?”

At this moment, many people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were on the verge of collapse.

Grieving howls began to resound from them.

To them, the Dragon Clan was simply too high of an existence.

In their eyes, the Dragon Clan was second to only the Holy Light Clan.

But, their reverence toward the Dragon Clan was directly proportional to how much they feared the Dragon Clan.

To them, offending the Dragon Clan was no different from offending gods. All they could do once they committed that sin would be wait for the Dragon Clan to send them to hell.

“Everyone, what are you all still standing around for? The Dragon Clan’s here. Are you all not planning to go over to greet them? Haven’t you all desired to return to the Dragon Clan the entire time?”

After saying those words, Chu Feng began to proceed toward the city entrance.

Different from the people of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect that were rushing over there, Chu Feng was slowly proceeding at an unhurried pace.

“Father, what are we to do now?”

Long Ning arrived beside Long Daozhi and tightly grabbed his arm.

Long Ning’s body was shivering violently. She was actually holding onto her father’s arm because she lacked the strength to stand firm on her own.

Never in her entire life had she ever felt this sort of fear before.

After all, that was the Dragon Clan.

“Lord City Master. Should we take this opportunity to flee?”

The other experts of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City also looked to Long Daozhi.

But, different from the helpless Long Ning, they were all putting forth suggestions.

Instead of waiting for death, fleeing might allow them to survive.

But, after Long Daozhi saw how at ease Chu Feng was as he left this place, he seemed to realize something.

“We’ve misjudged young friend Chu Feng. Faced with the pressure of the Dragon Clan, we’ve all lost our senses. But, let us not forget that young friend Chu Feng is not a reckless fellow,” said Long Daozhi.

“Lord City Master, what do you mean by that?” The crowd was confused by Long Daozhi.

“Come, let us go and check things out.”

As Long Daozhi spoke, he followed Chu Feng’s path and began proceeding toward the entrance of the city.

As for the others of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, even though they were feeling extremely terrified, they did not dare to go against their City Master’s desire. Thus, they braced themselves and followed after Long Daozhi.

...

Outside the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

An army of tens of thousands was flying over in the sky.

Riding exotic beasts and giant war chariots, they slowly arrived in an orderly manner.

Not only were their disposition of forces mighty, their Dragon Clan’s banner was also fluttering in the air.

As the Dragon Clan’s army was traveling very slowly, their appearance alarmed many people.

For example, the Starfall Holy Land and the other powers that were invited to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, they did not possess the heart to worry about the remnant and the treasures. Instead, they all began to stealthily follow after the Dragon Clan’s army.

After all, to them, the Dragon Clan was an existence akin to god.

Very rarely do they ever witness appearances of colossuses like the Dragon Clan.

Since they were fortunate enough to witness it today, they naturally wanted to expand their horizons.

Majestically, the Dragon Clan’s army arrived outside the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. But, they did not directly enter the city. Instead, they stopped outside.

When the guards of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City saw the Dragon Clan’s army, they grew so nervous that they didn’t even dare to utter a word. Instead, they all kneeled directly onto the ground.

The arrogant Dragon Clan did not take offense to the reactions from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s guards.

Instead, several figures walked out from a war chariot.

They were all people that Chu Feng knew very well.

They were the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Long Xiaoxiao, Long Xiaoxiao’s mother and the Dragon Clan’s Supreme Elder Long Duan.

Over half of the experts of the Dragon Clan were here.

After walking out, they directly started walking toward the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

But, all of a sudden, two figures appeared from within the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

They were the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster and his younger brother Dian Kuang.

“Save us! Save us!!!”

Once they appeared, they did not bother with any superfluous words and began crying for help.

“Impudent! If you dare to approach another step, consider your life forfeit!”

Before they could approach, the Dragon Clan’s guards revealed their weapons and arrested them.

“Milords, I am the Sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, Dian Xiong.”

“I am the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Supreme Elder, Dian Kuang.”

The Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster and Dian Kuang do not dare to show any disrespect toward the Dragon Clan. Both immediately kneeled onto the ground and introduced themselves.

Once they introduced who they were, the expressions of the then angry Dragon Clan’s guards lessened somewhat. The Supreme Elder Long Duan even walked over to the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s side.

“Lord Clan Chief, they possess some friendship with Lord Long Yinfeng. That Dian Kuang had once saved Lord Long Yinfeng’s life.

“Before Lord Long Yinfeng entered closed-door training, he had informed me that if Dian Kuang comes seeking help, as long as it’s not something too excessive, we should give him face and help him,” Long Duan said to their Clan Chief.

Long Duan and Long Yinfeng were both Supreme Elders. Furthermore, they possessed similar cultivation and were on very good terms with one another.

“Oh?”

Hearing those words, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief that was originally not planning to even look at the two men finally spoke to question them, “Why are the two of you at the Ancestral Martial Dragon City? And why are you crying for help?”

“Could it be that something happened in the Ancestral Martial Dragon City?”

Once the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked those questions, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster and Dian Kuang reacted as if an opportunity had finally presented itself to them. They immediately explained everything.

Sure enough, the two of them did not disappoint the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. Their explanation was not the truth as to what happened at all. Instead, they were adding all sorts of details to their story and making a false counter charge against Chu Feng and the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. They made themselves out to be the victims and Chu Feng and the Ancestral Martial Dragon City to be the evil perpetrators that were guilty beyond redemption.

But, after hearing their stories, the expressions of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and elders grew increasingly uglier.

Especially Long Xiaoxiao. Killing intent appeared in her eyes.

“You mean to say that Chu Feng is here?!”

Before they could finish their story, Long Xiaoxiao interrupted them with a stern voice. Her tone was extremely hostile.

“That’s right. Chu Feng is in there. He willfully slaughtered innocent lives, killing many people from our Flying Feather Heavenly Clan. Your Highness, please uphold justice for us,” said the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster with a look of grievance.

“In other words, the two of you fought Chu Feng?” Long Xiaoxiao’s expression grew increasingly gloomier.

Not knowing their relationship, the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect thought Long Xiaoxiao was feeling furious for them.

Because of that, they were all overjoyed.

They truly did not anticipate that it would be the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and Princess that came here today. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

More than that, they did not anticipate for Elder Long Yinfeng to have such a huge say within the Dragon Clan.

When it was known that they were humiliated and bullied by Chu Feng, even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and Princess displayed such anger and killing intent.

They really thought that Chu Feng and the Ancestral Martial Dragon City would not be able to survive past today, that none of them would be able to escape.

Right at this moment, a large number of people flew out from within the Dragon City in a grandiose manner.

They were Chu Feng, Long Daozhi, Long Ning and others from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

When Long Daozhi discovered that even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief came here, he began to lose his senses. Without hesitation, he immediately had all the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City kneel with him in midair.

“This lowly one is Long Daozhi. I pay my respect to the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Your Highness and Lords!”

“We pay our respect to the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Your Highness and Lords!!!”

Following him, voices resonated through heaven like thunder. They were not only the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. Even Wuming Doutian, Kong Tianhui, Xian Yun and people from other powers all kneeled to the Dragon Clan.

Faced with these grand existences from the Dragon Clan, they behaved like lowly commoners before the emperor.

But, the eyes of the Dragon Clansmen were not on them at all. Instead, they were all on Chu Feng.

“Little benefactor, you’re really here.”

Seeing Chu Feng, the gloomy expression on Long Xiaoxiao’s face disappeared.

She rapidly flew toward Chu Feng. Once she got to him, she was unable to conceal her happiness.

Long Xiaoxiao’s cheerful appearance completely flabbergasted Kong Tianhui and others.

This was especially true for Long Ning, Kong Ci and Xian Yun. Their expressions were simply marvelous.

Wasn’t that the Dragon Clan’s high and aloof princess? Why would she be this enthusiastic toward Chu Feng?

Furthermore, she called him...

Little...

Bene...

...factor?

It was not only the people of the younger generation that were stunned by this sight. All the people present were stunned.

“Young friend Chu Feng, it is truly fate to meet you here again.”

Before everyone could come back from their state of shock, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief also walked over to Chu Feng with Long Xiaoxiao’s mother and other elders.

His enthusiasm dumbstruck the crowd once more.

“We were originally planning to pay your Chu Heavenly Clan a visit after we finish the matter with the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. Who would’ve expected that we’ll actually encounter you here.”

“This sort of fate is truly rare,” said the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief with a face full of smiles.

What? Pay the Chu Heavenly Clan a visit?

The enthusiastic attitude displayed by the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and elders had shocked everyone already.

But, the powerful Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was actually planning to pay the Chu Heavenly Clan a visit?

Seeing this, the crowd were all shocked speechless. Complicated emotions filled their faces.

But, in terms of complicated emotions, the ones with the most complicated emotions on their faces would be the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster and his younger brother Dian Kuang.

They were taking delight in the disaster that was about to befall Chu Feng and the Ancestral Martial Dragon City earlier. But now, their faces were frozen stiff and were completely lost as to what to do.

The fear from their heart had spread through their entire body.

After all, it would appear to them that the current situation was not quite the same as what they were imagining.
