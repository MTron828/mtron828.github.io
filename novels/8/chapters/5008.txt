Chapter 5008: Dragon Breath

Even if Chu Feng wasn’t interested in the delicacy, there was nothing he could do about it. Even though he appeared to be the Netherworld Envoy’s traveling companion on the surface, the truth was that he was nothing but a prisoner.

The forest was vast beyond imagination, larger than a smaller Ordinary Realm.

Chu Feng noticed that the other cultivators in the forest were also searching aimlessly around, seemingly looking for the delicacy too.

In contrast, the Netherworld Envoy seemed to know his way around. He confidently led the way.

Soon, he stopped before the edge of a cliff.

There was an old and weathered wooden hut hanging by the cliff, but Chu Feng could tell with a glance that there was something extraordinary about the wooden hut. It seemed to possess a life of its own, grabbing tightly onto the cliff to keep itself from falling.

There was a signboard hanging in front of the wooden hut, writing ‘Dragon Breath Spring Chamber’.

“I actually found it! Chu Feng, you’re really blessed with good luck!” the Netherworld Envoy exclaimed in delight.

As he spoke, a layer of spirit power flowed out from him and cloaked his body. His red veil and robe turned blue, and the embroidered words ‘Netherworld Envoy’ vanished from sight.

“What kind of place is this for you to go to the extent of disguising yourself? Does this place not welcome members from the Netherworld Sect?” Chu Feng asked.

“The Netherworld Sect doesn’t have the best reputation out there. You should also take note not to mention my identity inside later,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

It sounded like a reminder, but Chu Feng knew that it was actually a threat.

After that, the Netherworld Envoy led Chu Feng into the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber.

The interior was larger than what the exterior let show, but it still looked old and shabby. There were quite a few people inside when they entered, and all of them had excited looks on their faces. It was as if being able to enter the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber was something worth celebrating.

“That brother over there, do you have any Dragon Spring Coins? I’m willing to exchange it with this Exalted Armament I’ve inherited from my ancestors.”

As soon as they stepped in, a white-haired elder approached them with a silver saber in hand. It was an Exalted Armament, and it looked to be of decent quality.

“I do, but I refuse.”

The Netherworld Envoy turned him down before settling down at one of the tables.

“Waiter, two bowls of Dragon Spring.”

The Netherworld Envoy slammed his hand on the table, placing twenty triangular metallic items down.

These metallic items looked ordinary at first glance, but their peculiar nature revealed itself upon careful examination. They were made out of exquisite material, and each of them was inscribed with a dragon. The dragon was able to move on the surface of the coin as if it possessed a life of its own.

It was actually a type of formation.

Soon, a waiter rushed over.

Chu Feng’s eyes widened upon seeing the waiter. He immediately noticed that there was something unusual about the waiter.

Despite looking like a human, the waiter had scales on his face and body. These scales belonged neither to that of a fish or snake; it resembled that of a dragon.

“Hold on for a moment.”

The waiter took the Dragon Spring Coins and left the area.

“Brother, why don’t you take pity on me and exchange those Dragon Spring Coins with me? I’ll throw this treasure in as well! It took me 500 years to find this Dragon Breath Spring Chamber. It wasn’t easy for me to stumble upon it today, but…”

The white-haired man from earlier on approached them with the same Exalted Armament in his grasp, but there was an additional Cosmos Sack in his hand.

“How could you fail to find ten Dragon Spring Coins within five hundred years? That only shows that you haven’t been looking hard enough, or maybe you weren’t even trying to look for it at all. It’s only sheer luck that you managed to stumble onto the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber today.

“Brother, the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber is reserved for those who are prepared. Someone who isn’t prepared is bound to be unable to enjoy the Dragon Spring. You should give up,” the Netherworld Envoy replied impatiently.

“Indeed! Those who don’t have Dragon Spring Coins aren’t qualified to enjoy the Dragon Spring. Stop embarrassing yourself here and get lost!”

“Scram! Scram!”

Those words won the approval of many in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber. There were even some who tried to chase him off.

What was worth mentioning was that the waiter of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber didn’t say a word at all. He didn’t try to chase off the white-haired elder even though the latter didn’t have the money to pay.

“Hmph! I don’t believe that no one would exchange their Dragon Spring Coins with me!”

The white-haired man harrumphed coldly upon facing yet another rejection, but he didn’t leave the wooden hut. Instead, he returned to the entrance and waited for another group of customers to enter.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng began glancing at the other tables. He noticed that the other customers had bowls filled with water in front of them. The water seemed to harness some kind of energy, but it wasn’t particularly strong.

At first glance, he couldn’t discern anything special about the Dragon Spring.

However, he did notice that the customers would reveal looks of pleasure whenever he took a sip of the Dragon Spring. It was hard to exactly describe their expressions with words; it looked almost as if they had ascended to paradise for a moment there.

“What’s so special about the Dragon Spring for that person to exchange his Exalted Armament for it?” Chu Feng asked.

“We were lucky enough to stumble upon the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber. I would have told you just how special the Dragon Spring is even if you hadn’t asked me.”

The Netherworld Envoy began sharing the story behind the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber.

No one know who the owner of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber was, but the person managing it was a clan member of the Dragon Breath Clan. The waiter they had met earlier on was a clan member of the Dragon Breath Clan too.

The Dragon Breath Clan were descendants of the True Dragon, inheriting the power of Dragon Breath. The Dragon Spring was none other than spring water refined using the power of Dragon Breath.

The Dragon Spring was known for its ability to strengthen one’s body and enhance one’s lifespan, and what truly drew people in was its delectable flavors. It was an unrivaled delicacy in the world.

It was said to bring unspeakable bliss to those who were fortunate enough to taste it.

The only problem was that it was no easy feat to prepare the Dragon Spring, and the quantity was severely limited too.

As a result, the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber, despite having ten branches, would only open for business once every year. The location it would appear at each time was also random.

Furthermore, the Dragon Spring could only be bought with Dragon Spring Coins.

In other words, anyone who sought to have a taste of the Dragon Spring would need to prepare Dragon Spring Coins beforehand and be lucky enough to stumble upon the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber.

It was just that the Dragon Spring Coins circulating outside were being sold at exorbitant prices, and there was a good chance that it might prove to be useless since finding the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber posed a huge problem as well. Few in the world would bear to spend a hefty sum to purchase Dragon Spring Coins beforehand just for an uncertain possibility.

These restrictive factors made it the Dragon Spring an incredibly elusive beverage for most cultivators.

The white-haired old man was one example. He was lucky enough to stumble upon the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber, but he failed to prepare the Dragon Spring Coins beforehand, so he couldn’t order the Dragon Spring for himself.

“But you knew where the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber was,” Chu Feng pointed out quizzically.

“I received guidance from an expert. It wasn’t certain either. I could only say that we were lucky. This is also my first time tasting the Dragon Spring. I heard that it can make a person forget about all his troubles. Let’s wait patiently. You definitely won’t be disappointed.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The excitement in the Netherworld Envoy’s tone made it clear that he looked forward to it.

That explained why the Netherworld Envoy had chosen to stop by this area despite being in such a rush to return to the Netherworld Sect.
