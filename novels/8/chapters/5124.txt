Chapter 5124: Kill Them

“Brat, what’s with your attitude? Are you looking to be killed too?”

The leader of the guards threatened fiercely. However, Chu Feng continued to ignore him.

“Milord, we swear loyalty to you!”

Over a million figures rushed over to the guards’ side, kneeling right in front of the leader of the guards. They were those who spoke up against Lord Yuwei earlier.

“Not bad. The insults you have directed at Song Yuwei are to my liking, so I’ll allow you to live,” the leader of the guards said.

He then turned to Chu Feng and the others and sneered, “As for the rest of you… you deserve to die.”

Boom!

The leader of the guards shrouded Lord Yuwei and the others with his oppressive might, blocking off their path of escape. His murderous aura made the crowd shudder.

“Milord, we’re also willing to follow you. Please spare us!”

More people tried to head over to the guards’ side, but they realized that they couldn’t leave the encirclement created by the leader of the guards. Thus, they could only kneel on the spot and beg for mercy.

These people had previously expressed that they were unwilling to follow Lord Yuwei anymore, just that they didn’t insult Lord Yuwei.

“Show me some sincerity if you wish to follow me!”

The leader of the guards glanced at those who had previously insulted Song Yuwei and were now kneeling in front of him. What he wanted couldn’t be clearer. He was demanding those who wanted to side with him to sever their ties with Song Yuwei.

Many caught his drift and immediately directed insults toward Lord Yuwei.

“Song Yuwei, it’s all your fault. How could you listen to his words? You dispelled the barrier just because that brat told you to. To think that we put our trust in you, but we’re now going to die because of you!”

“Song Yuwei, you aren’t worthy of being our master! You aren’t!”

Even those who were loyal to Lord Yuwei started to criticize her. The leader of the guards and his subordinates burst into laughter at this sight. They had been holding back just so that they could watch Lord Yuwei being sidelined by the very people she was protecting.

“Song Yuwei, aren’t you pitiful? You fought so hard for these people, but all of them turned their backs on you. I guess I’ll tell you the truth after all. Our master has already awakened, and the very first order he issued was for us to massacre all of you. In other words… your fates have already been sealed from the very start.”

The leader of the guards turned to the million people kneeling in front of him.

“That includes the lot of you too.”

The traitors’ faces turned pale. Some of them started bawling out of sheer horror.

“Milord, we are earnestly pledging our loyalty to you!”

They tried professing their loyalty to the leader of the guards, but the latter simply sneered in response.

“Those who are willing to serve the Night Monarch have already become guards by now. People like you who only start begging when your lives are threatened aren’t even qualified to serve me, let alone the Night Monarch!”

“Night Monarch? Is he your master?” Chu Feng asked.

“Indeed,” the leader of the guards replied.

“Where is the Night Monarch?” Chu Feng asked.

“You wish to meet the Night Monarch? No worries, you’ll meet him in due time. Men, capture all of them!”

The leader of the guards waved his hand, and millions of guards immediately darted toward the city. Soon enough, the hundreds of millions of civilians living in the city were captured and brought over.

The guards forced the crowd to march toward their barren territory, and soon, they arrived on a plot of blood-red land. There was a mysterious ancient tower located on the blood-red land, giving off an overpowering smell of blood.

An altar was stationed right outside the ancient tower, and its surroundings were littered with white bones and dried bloodstains. The overpowering blood stench was coming from the altar.

The crowd was horrified to see this scene.

They finally understood the fate that had befallen those who had been taken away by the guards. They had been sacrificed as tributes on this altar!

Without a doubt, the rest of them were next.

In contrast, Chu Feng’s attention was focused on the ancient tower.

“Throw them in!” the leader of the guards ordered.

The guards began pushing Chu Feng and the others into the assimilation formation.

“Let’s see who dares to do that!” Lord Yuwei bellowed.

She began emanating a golden glow once more, ready to release the secret skill from before.

Pah!

However, a hand suddenly fell on Lord Yuwei’s shoulder, stopping her.

“Little young master, you…”

Lord Yuwei stared at Chu Feng in shock.

She was shocked not because Chu Feng had stopped her but because of the incredible power that was coming from him. She couldn’t believe that a junior like Chu Feng was actually able to reach such a level of strength.

Chu Feng noticed Lord Yuwei’s shock, and he responded with a smile.

“Elder, didn’t I tell you that I won’t allow those who are loyal to you to die?” Chu Feng said.

He turned to the leader of the guards and said, “Thank you for bringing us here. Your mission is done here, so you may die now.”

“Brat, what nonsense are you spouting?”

The leader of the guards stared at Chu Feng in disbelief, wondering if he had heard wrongly. The others who had heard Chu Feng’s words felt incredulous too.

The situation was clearly not in Chu Feng’s favor, so how could he utter such arrogant words?

“You can’t hear me clearly? I’ll repeat myself then. All of you can die now,” Chu Feng spoke with an even louder voice.

“He’s telling us to die?”

“Does he think that he can kill us?”

“Hahaha! He must think that his mouth possesses some sort of superpower!”

“The despair must have spoiled his brain!”

The guards burst into laughter, amused by Chu Feng’s words. Chu Feng also started laughing along with them, which further reinforced the guards’ perception that he had gone mad.

Their laughter didn’t last for long.

They suddenly sensed a burst of killing intent colder than anything they had ever felt before, and it was coming from none other than Chu Feng.

They couldn’t believe it. How could a junior emanate such a killing intent.

Weng!

While the guards were still trying to understand what was going on, a massive spirit formation gate manifested behind Chu Feng. The next instant, tens of millions of Asura World Spirits flew out and stood behind Chu Feng in a neat formation.

The world fell completely silent in an instant. No one could laugh at this turn of events.

The Asura World Spirits were like demons who had emerged from the depths of hell, powerful and intimidating. The tremendous pressure they exerted made the guards tremble in fear. They finally understood why Chu Feng dared to say those words. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It turned out that he did have the power to obliterate them all.

Shoosh!

All of a sudden, a silhouette started dashing for the ancient tower.

Gah!

Before that person could even get close to the ancient tower, a cry of agony escaped from his lips. He was none other than the leader of the guards.

He wanted to escape into the tower upon seeing that the situation was no longer favorable to him, but an arm suddenly grabbed him and snapped his bones in half.

The Asura King had made his move!

Seeing how the powerful leader of the guards was defeated in a single strike, everyone couldn’t help but stare at Chu Feng in shock, including Lord Bai and Lord Yuwei.

What happened next was even more shocking.

The powerful Asura King dragged the leader of the guards in front of Chu Feng before bowing deeply to the latter.

“Master, how do you intend to deal with these ants?” the Asura King asked.

“Kill them all,” Chu Feng said.

“What about them?”

The Asura King glanced at another group of people. They were the ones who had betrayed Lord Yuwei and insulted her earlier. He thought that those people had gone overboard, which was why he was asking Chu Feng how he intended to deal with them.

Chu Feng didn’t even bother to glance at them.

“Don’t bother sparing anyone.”
