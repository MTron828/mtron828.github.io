Chapter 3661 - Father’s Possession

“Wow! This is what it means by, like father, like son!”

“Big brother Chu Feng, you’re truly amazing. Sure enough, you’re comparable to senior Chu Xuanyuan,” Long Ning looked at Chu Feng with admiration.

“What do you mean by comparable? Although senior Chu Xuanyuan is very powerful, my brother Chu Feng is very powerful too. I feel that my brother Chu Feng has already surpassed senior Chu Xuanyuan. This isn’t ‘like father, like son,’ this is the ‘young surpassing the old,’” said Kong Tianhui.

Seeing the people beside him joking around, Chu Feng had a smile on his face.

Chu Feng was rather fond of this sort of atmosphere. This was even more so when the people that were acting so close to him were previously filled with hostility towards him.

Chu Feng understood that the reason for this enormous change was not purely because he had defeated the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations and Nangong Yifan.

Most importantly, it was because they were people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

That was how people behaved. They all had a sense of belonging.

While people of the same clan would have internal strife and brothers would fight with each other, they remained close to each other. If they were to encounter foreign enemies that came to bully and humiliate them, they would unanimously fight against the foreign enemies.

The Ancestral Martial Starfield was the same. Although the various powers occupied different places in the vast starfield, and would fight and scheme against each other and even kill each other, they still had a sense of belonging, a sense of connection with each other.

That is, they were all martial cultivators from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Normally, they would not feel this sort of identity. Within the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they would only think about their respective powers, and never once consider the relationship that they might possess with the other powers present in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

However, when people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield were being bullied and humiliated by people from other starfields, they would realize their identity, and realize that they were all one people. At such a time, they would forget about their grievances and hatreds with one another and work together to fight against the foreign enemies.

Of course, not everyone could act this way.

The people present were all of the younger generation. They were all young and relatively innocent.

They were more hot-blooded and affectionate, and not scheming. They would not weigh the pros and cons of their actions.

That was why such a scene came to be.

At least, at that moment, those people looked like a family.

According to past conventions, after the people of the younger generation finished their sparring, the Divine Armament Villa would provide hospitality to them. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Although the sparring session this time around caused the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations extreme depression, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were always the ones feeling depressed in the past sparrings.

Because of that, even though the people of the All-heaven Starfield had absolutely no interest in the following banquet, even though they simply did not wish to participate, for the sake of giving face and displaying their thoughtfulness, they decided to participate in it. Even Nangong Yifan was present. Of course, Yin Zhuanghong was also present.

Apart from Lord Shoujian, only people of the younger generation were present in the banquet. Normally, it would be Kong Ci and Long Ning who sat beside Lord Shoujian.

However, this banquet was different. Chu Feng was the one who sat beside Lord Shoujian. Of course... this was not something that he did of his own accord. Instead, it was Lord Shoujian’s request.

Lord Shoujian would generally not drink in the past events. However, this time around, he was actually drinking quite a lot. It appeared that he was truly in a cheerful mood.

“It’s not only Lord Shoujian that’s feeling joyous. I’m also feeling very joyous. Every year, we had to watch the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations act so complacently at the banquet. Yet, look at them this year; they’re not even eating all this fine food. I am simply overjoyed to be seeing this.”

“We’ve been suppressed by them for so long. Finally, we’ve managed to get our revenge.”

“That said, Lord Shoujian does seem to be particularly fond of Chu Feng.”

“Mn. That’s true. I also noticed it.”

“However, I am able to understand why. After all, Chu Feng is so outstanding. Aren’t the seniors always fond of outstanding people of the younger generation?”

At that moment, the people of the younger generation all noticed Lord Shoujian’s change in behavior.

Lord Shoujian was someone who would never touch a drop of alcohol in the past. However, he had suddenly decided to drink wine of his own accord. Not only had his face turned a deep red from all the wine he’d drunk, but even his neck had turned red.

He had truly drank a lot, and was truly overjoyed. He had been smiling and unable to conceal his happiness since the banquet had begun. His mouth was practically open the entire time.

Most importantly, he had been chatting with Chu Feng practically the entire time. Thus, it was obvious that Chu Feng was the reason why he was feeling so cheerful.

“Young friend Chu Feng, do you recognize this?”

Lord Shoujian took out an item from his Cosmos Sack and handed it to Chu Feng.

It was an object that resembled a scroll. However, it seemed to be made of steel. It was entirely silver, and was also sealed. Although it resembled a scroll, it was not a scroll, since it could not be opened.

Seeing the complicated symbols and runes on the scroll-like object, Chu Feng knew that it was most definitely an extraordinary item.

“This junior’s knowledge is limited. I do not know this item. Senior, could you tell me what it is?” said Chu Feng.

“You don’t recognize this? It’s your father’s possession.” said Lord Shoujian.

“My father’s possession?”

Chu Feng’s gaze changed enormously upon discovering that the scroll-like item was related to his father. Even his heart was no longer able to remain calm.

Chu Feng was not the only one. At that moment, practically all the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations turned to look at the item Lord Shoujian held in his hand.

“Senior, is this truly my father’s possession?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right. Back then, your father had just arrived at our Divine Armament Villa when the Divine Armament Cemetery opened. Because of that, he had decided to enter. However, upon doing so, he actually took away the best weapon inside.”

“At that time, your father did not have any relationship with our Divine Armament Villa. Thus, he felt very apologetic at having taken away our best weapon, and decided to give this item to this old man instead.”

“Speaking of it, this item is something that your father brought back from the Greenfield Upper Realm’s Demon Prison Valley,” said Lord Shoujian.

“Greenfield Upper Realm Demon Prison Valley?”

Hearing those words, the eyes of the people of the younger generation started to shine even more.

As everyone knew, there were Three Great Eccentrics’ Remnants in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

They were respectively the Nine Dragons Upper Realm’s Ice Summit’s Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, the Sealcalm Upper Realm’s Netherseal Cave’s Netherworld Chariot, and the Lonesome Upper Realm’s Mirror Sea’s Battle God’s Halberd.

However, there were actually Nine Great Eccentrics’ Remnants in the past.

Merely, the treasures from the other Great Eccentrics’ Remnants had already been retrieved. The people who had retrieved those treasures were both related to Chu Feng.

They were respectively his grandfather Chu Hanxian, and his father, Chu Xuanyuan.

As for the Greenfield Upper Realm’s Demon Prison Valley, it was the place where one such remnant was located in the past.

Thus, although that seal-like item appeared to be unremarkable, it was most definitely not an ordinary treasure if it had been retrieved from the Demon Prison Valley by Chu Xuanyuan.

Extremely curious, Kong Tianhui, Kong Ci and the others left their seats and arrived beside Lord Shoujian and Chu Feng. together, they began to carefully examine the treasure.

However, no matter how they examined it, they were unable to determine anything.

Curious, Kong Ci asked, “Lord Shoujian, exactly what is that?”

However, to everyone’s surprise, Lord Shoujian smiled and shook his head, “This old man has no clue either.”
