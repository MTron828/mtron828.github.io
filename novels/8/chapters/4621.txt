Chapter 4621: A Different Attitude

It was a scream manifesting from the fear and horror of a woman. Chu Feng noticed that the woman’s face had turned as red as an apple out of embarrassment, so he quickly turned his head around.

He was no longer the young him anymore, so he respected how others felt more. He used to act as he pleased, but when he realized that some of his actions could inadvertently harm others, perhaps even bringing about lasting traumas, he decided to curb himself. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He felt deep regret for some of those he had hurt in the past, like Ya Fei, Yan Ruyu, and Mu Rongwan. Even to this day, he felt that he owed something to them, but he had no idea how to make up for it.

Not wanting to do that to another person, he decided not to take advantage of Xia Yan.

“This... Hurry up and wash the mud off! We need to leave quickly, or else we’ll be in danger!”

After saying those words, Chu Feng immediately left the palace.

By the time he came out, he realized that Xiao Yu had returned. The latter had already reverted back to his male appearance. However, the sight of her bathing still continued lingering in his mind.

It was just a peek, but the image seemed to have been imprinted deep in his mind. He couldn’t wave it away no matter what he did.

Xiao Yu’s true appearance was extremely beautiful. It was fortunate that Chu Feng had a lot of self-discipline, or else another man would have surely...

“If you dare tell others what happened earlier, I’ll kill you.”

Xiao Yu glared at Chu Feng ferociously, but her words were relayed through voice transmission.

Chu Feng felt incredibly helpless. He knew that he was the one at fault here, so he could only respond with a bitter smile.

“You can’t blame me for that. How am I know that you’re a woman? I wouldn’t have entered your palace if I had known. However, you need not worry. I won’t speak of this matter to anyone else.”

Chu Feng responded to her through voice transmission too.

Xiao Yu didn’t respond to him, but he retracted his glare. It would seem like he had chosen to trust Chu Feng for the time being.

Weng!

All of a sudden, a brilliant light burst forth, and Xia Yan’s palace began to shrink. When Xia Yan finally walked out once more, she had also reverted back to the appearance of a man once more.

“My apologies. It took me a while to wash myself clean. Speaking of which, brother Chu Feng, you came in to hurry up earlier. Did something happen?”

His smiling appearance looked no different from how he acted earlier. It was almost as if the small accident earlier didn’t happen at all.

“There’s a terrifying power in the heart of the marsh. I can’t say for sure what it is, but it’s gradually approaching the surface. We need to quickly leave this area to be safe,” Chu Feng replied.

“But it doesn’t look like we’ll be able to pass this marsh...”

Xia Yan looked at the obstacle standing in his way and frowned.

Chu Feng’s initial intention was to wash off the marsh so that they could safely pass, but in the process of cleaning it, he realized that there was more to the marsh than what he initially expected. If he were to continue cleansing it, he could further provoke the terrifying power hidden in the depths of the marsh.

He couldn’t discern whether that terrifying power was a living being or just a mass of power, but in any case, it was a fact that the terrifying power had already awoken and was heading their way. The only good news here was that the terrifying power was moving at a relatively slow speed.

“Follow me, I’ll bring you across.”

Chu Feng opened his palm up, and a transparent bubble slowly floated into the air. As it rose up, it grew larger and enveloped Chu Feng.

This formation wasn’t very big, but it had strong defensive properties.

Chu Feng had already thought of a solution for them to pass through the marsh. In order to ensure that things wouldn’t go wrong, he even took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk to further strengthen the formation.

“Woah, brother Chu Feng. Your horsetail whisk is obviously no ordinary treasure!” Xia Yan exclaimed with googly eyes as he stared at the horsetail whisk in envy.

“How would I dare to enter this place if I don’t have some treasures to rely on?” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He quickly activated the formation and channeled it across the marsh.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

As soon as Chu Feng came to the vicinity of the marsh, the thorns inside the marsh began darting in their direction. At the same time, the marsh beneath began wiggling as if it had a life of its own. It was made blatantly apparent that nothing good would happen if they were to drop into the marsh.

Even though the three of them were protected by the formation, the powerful ramming force of the thorns made the formation waver a little.

Knowing the precarious situation they were in, Chu Feng dared not to get careless at all. He channeled his spirit power through the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk before infusing it into the formation. Under the influx of power, the formation was able to remain stable.

Thanks to that, they were able to pass through the marsh safely.

Nevertheless, even after they landed back on the ground, Xiao Yu and Xia Yan’s hearts wouldn’t stop beating fearfully. The earlier offense from the marsh was simply too terrifying. Had it not been for Chu Feng, they would have never been able to pass through it

“How did you manage to do it?” Xiao Yu asked.

“What are you referring to?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re at rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation. It’s impossible for there to be any mistakes with the Wretched Black Demon’s test. With your spirit power, it’s impossible for you to summon such great power. You are tapping into another source of power... the power of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace,” Xiao Yu said.

It was just suspicions earlier, but he was certain now that Chu Feng had somehow taken control over the energy of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. Otherwise, it was impossible for Chu Feng to display such great power.

“It’s my secret, so you need not know too much about it. However, if you really wish to know, it’s not as if I can’t tell you. Don’t you think it’s only appropriate for you to reveal your own secrets when asking for another person’s?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

Xiao Yu immediately turned his head away, turning a deaf ear to what Chu Feng had just said.

On the other hand, Chu Feng turned to Xia Yan and asked, “How about you? Do you want to trade your secret with mine?”

“My secret? What kind of secret would a person like me have? Oh, I did step onto dogshit once when I was younger, would that count?” Xia Yan asked with a chuckle.

“Of course... not.”

Chu Feng rolled his eyes as he prepared to continue heading forward with Xiao Yu.

But all of a sudden, a hand darted forth to grab Chu Feng’s robe. It was Xia Yan.

He was not looking at him with his usual mischievous smile. Instead, there was a pitiful glint in his eyes.

Even though he was still in the appearance of a man, his eyes carried the tenderness of a woman.

“Brother Chu Feng, I won’t pursue the matter that happened earlier. After all, I was the one who hid it from you in the first place. However, you must hide the secret for me. I... I haven’t even married yet! If this matter were to get out, who would dare to marry me in the future?”

Xia Yan spoke via her voice transmission, which showed that she was very affected by this matter too. It was just that her attitude was much softer was compare to Xiao Yu.

Compared to Xiao Yu’s warning, Chu Feng felt much more receptive to Xia Yan’s softer attitude.

“Don’t worry, there’s no way no one will want you. Even though it was only a glance, I can honestly tell you that... you’re very beautiful,” Chu Feng replied through voice transmission too.

These words had come from the bottom of his heart.

Even though Xia Yan didn’t look particularly outstanding as a man, in truth, his female appearance was incredibly beautiful. She had a mature charm that would immediately stand out even amidst a huge crowd of people.

“I don’t care. You must keep it a secret, or else I’ll cling onto you if I can’t find a husband in the future. I should tell you that my nickname is dog skin plaster. Once I stick onto you, you won’t be able to shake me away anymore!”(Dog skin plaster is basically medicine smeared on dog kin and used as a plaster. It’s known to be sticky, especially fake ones, and it’s tough to tear them off once it gets on you.)

A hint of anxiety could be heard in Xia Yan’s voice.

“Fine fine fine, you win. I’ll keep it a secret for you, alright?”

After saying those words, Chu Feng quickly jogged in front to catch up with Xiao Yu, who had moved on ahead without them.

“This is more like it.”

Seeing that Chu Feng had agreed to it, Xia Yan nodded in satisfaction. But soon later, a hint of confusion flashed across his eyes.

“Wait a moment, this doesn’t seem right. Hey! What do you mean by that? Doesn’t that mean that you view me as a bother?”

Xia Yan spoke to Chu Feng through voice transmission as he shook his fist indignantly while chasing him.
