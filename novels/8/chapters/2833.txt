Chapter 2833 - Rank Five True Immortal

Chu Feng was indeed incapable of hearing what Her Lady Queen was saying. He had indeed been affected by the Sacred Tree Illusory Fog.

Chu Feng currently had a perplexed expression on his face. Confusion filled his face.

He didn‚Äôt not understand why he had suddenly appeared there, nor did he know where he was. His memory was extremely chaotic, and there was no trace of rationality in his train of thought.

At that moment, everything in the surroundings was akin to a dream, an illusion, for Chu Feng.

"Feng‚Äôer."

Suddenly, a voice sounded.

Hearing that voice, Chu Feng‚Äôs mind was immediately shaken. It was as if all of the distresses and worries in his mind had vanished like smoke in thin air.

All of his questions, all of his worries, were no longer important. The reason for that was because Chu Feng remembered that voice so very well. It was the voice of Chu Feng‚Äôs father.

"Father, is that you?"

As Chu Feng asked that question, he started to rapidly fly toward the direction where his father‚Äôs voice sounded from.

"Father!!!"

Finally, Chu Feng managed to see his father. It was indeed his father, Chu Xuanyuan.

However, after seeing his father, Chu Feng revealed a panicked and worried expression.

Chu Xuanyuan was standing not far away from Chu Feng. However, Chu Xuanyuan was covered with blood. He was seriously injured. Like a dying man, he was extremely weak.

"Father!" Chu Feng shouted.

As he shouted loudly, Chu Feng rushed toward Chu Xuanyuan. Weakly, Chu Xuanyuan fell into Chu Feng‚Äôs bosom.

Weakly, Chu Xuanyuan said to Chu Feng, "Feng‚Äôer, quickly, run away. Do not concern yourself with me, run away immediately."

"Roar~~~"

As Chu Xuanyuan said those words to Chu Feng, Chu Feng was able to clearly hear a deafening and extremely strange-sounding roar. That roar was being emitted from the direction Chu Xuanyuan had emerged from, and was sounding nonstop.

At the same time, Chu Feng also felt an extremely powerful aura.

That aura was simply too frightening. Feeling that aura, Chu Feng felt as if it was simply impossible for him to contend against it.

"Damn it!"

Seeing that the situation was very bad, Chu Feng grabbed onto his father and began to rapidly escape into the distance.

However, no matter how Chu Feng tried to flee, his surroundings were still filled with a vast white fog.

That mysterious yet frightening aura was following Chu Feng the entire time. Furthermore, it was closing the distance between it and Chu Feng.

"Feng‚Äôer, let go of me, it is coming for me."

"As long as you let go of me, you‚Äôll be able to escape, escape by yourself," Chu Feng‚Äôs father said.

"No, father, I will not abandon you. If we are to flee, we‚Äôll flee together. If we are to die, we‚Äôll die together," Chu Feng said in a determined manner.

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, the surrounding fog actually started to dissipate. Chu Feng discovered that his surroundings were actually a vast mountain.

Characters filled the surface of the mountain. Those characters were extremely strange. However, Chu Feng seemed to be able to understand them.

"Feng‚Äôer, quickly, read them. Read the characters on the mountain," Chu Xuanyuan urged.

Hearing what his father said, Chu Feng didn‚Äôt have the time to think things over, and immediately started voicing the characters. Chu Feng had no idea what he was reading. However, he was actually able to read them aloud.

After Chu Feng read those characters, the characters started emitting a golden radiance.

"Aooouuu~~~"

The next moment, the mysterious existence chasing after Chu Feng from behind let out an incomparably miserable roar.

At that moment, Chu Feng realized that those characters were actually capable of curbing the mysterious monster behind him.

Under these sorts of circumstances, how could Chu Feng bother to think about anything else? Disregarding all potential consequences, Chu Feng began to loudly read the characters on the mountain nonstop.

However, Chu Feng discovered that the characters could only be read once. Reading a character that he had already read would not cause it to emit golden radiance.

As long as no golden radiance was emitted, that mysterious monster would not be scared.

Thus, Chu Feng had to move continuously and read different characters nonstop.

The mountain was very large. There were also a lot of characters. For the sake of contending against that mysterious monster, Chu Feng could only continue to search for those characters on the mountain and then read them aloud.

Under this sort of circumstance, Chu Feng felt as if time was passing nonstop. Several days seemed to have passed in the blink of an eye.

As for the mountain range, regardless of how enormous it might be, it would one day be completely transversed by Chu Feng.

Finally, that day arrived. Chu Feng had traveled completely over the entire mountain. He had practically been to every nook and corner of the mountain.

All of the characters on the mountain had been read by him.

After all of the characters on the mountain were read by Chu Feng, the mysterious monster behind him stopped its miserable screams.

Chu Feng had lost the ability to curb it.

"Roar~~~~"

Suddenly, a roar was heard. The next moment, Chu Feng and his father were both tightly bounded by a tentacle.

That tentacle was simply enormous. Being bound by the tentacle was simply akin to being completely sealed away for Chu Feng and his father.

That being said, Chu Feng still noticed that the tentacle was black and filled with scales. Not only was that monster frightening, its origin should be no small matter either. At the very least, Chu Feng had never seen a monster like that before.

"Father, exactly what sort of monster is this? How could it be so powerful that even you are no match against it?"

Chu Feng was starting to panic.

Although he had only witnessed the tentacle of the monster, and not witnessed how it actually looked, merely that tentacle was enough for Chu Feng to determine how terrifying that monster was.

Chu Feng even started feeling as if he would not be able to defeat that monster in his entire lifetime.

That was simply not a monster of the mortal world. Rather, it was a monster from hell, a demon from hell.

"Feng‚Äôer, do not panic. Recall all of the characters that you‚Äôve seen on the mountain and carefully arrange them," Chu Xuanyuan said to Chu Feng.

After hearing what Chu Xuanyuan said, Chu Feng began to do as his father instructed even though he didn‚Äôt understand why his father wanted him to do that. Fortunately, Chu Feng was actually really able to remember all of the characters that he had read earlier.

After Chu Feng started to carefully arrange all of those characters in his head, a strange sort of sensation emerged.

That sort of sensation was as if Chu Feng had entered an endless ocean filled with martial power. Furthermore, there was a gate before him.

Chu Feng felt as if he would be able to obtain rebirth should he pass through that gate.

That‚Äôs right, what Chu Feng was feeling at that moment was the feeling of making a breakthrough.

"Feng‚Äôer, quickly, make your breakthrough. As long as you succeed in breaking through, you will be able to draw forth the Divine Tribulation‚Äôs lightning."

"The Divine Tribulation‚Äôs lightning is the nemesis of that monster. It is capable of eliminating that monster," Chu Xuanyuan‚Äôs voice sounded again. Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

Under these circumstances, Chu Feng did not dare to hesitate. He immediately seized the opportunity and began his breakthrough attempt.

Everything happened without a hitch. Soon, Chu Feng successfully made his breakthrough.

Shortly afterward, lightning filled the sky above. Nine-colored divine lightning was galloping in the sky like dragons.

"Rumble~~~"

Suddenly, the nine-colored lightning struck down from the sky above.

This time around, the nine-colored lightning seemed to not be coming for Chu Feng. Instead, it was striking down on that monster that had chased Chu Feng and his father nonstop.

At that moment, miserable roars from that monster were heard once again.

However, it seemed like that monster was not planning to let go of Chu Feng and his father.

It began to strengthen the grasp of its tentacle.

Chu Feng felt as if his body and soul were about to be forcibly crushed by that powerful strength.

Pain akin to his body being torn apart was coming from all over his body.

At the moment when Chu Feng felt that he was about to die, that monster‚Äôs body suddenly dissipated.

Chu Feng had escaped. Not only that, but the lightning had also dispersed.

Furthermore, Chu Feng was able to feel with certainty that his cultivation had also increased.

He had successfully made a breakthrough. From the cultivation of rank four True Immortal, Chu Feng had made a breakthrough to rank five True Immortal.
