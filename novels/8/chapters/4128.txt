Chapter 4128 - Ancient Era’s Stone Plate

Fumo Shaoyu sent forth a palm strike. His powerful palm ruthlessly smashed into Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s shoulder.

“Paa~~~”

The palm strike not only shattered Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s shoulder, it also smashed him into a cliff.

“Motherfucker! I’m going to dismember you into ten thousand pieces!”

After being struck, Zuoqiu Tiancheng not only did not cower, he instead shouted furiously before soaring into the sky to confront Fumo Shaoyu again.

His cultivation had changed. He was no longer a rank two Utmost Exalted, but rather a rank three Utmost Exalted.

A Lightning Mark had appeared on his forehead.

Furthermore, the Lightning Mark was the character ‘Divine.’

Just like the rumors had said, Zuoqiu Tiancheng had trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

However, Chu Feng noticed that even though Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s Lightning Mark was also the character ‘Divine,’ it was somewhat different from his own.

The difference was that the lightning from Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s Lightning Mark was not surging ferociously.

Furthermore, it seemed like his bloodline aura was also slightly lacking.

“Hahaha. What a bullshit Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan. You actually do not even possess a complete Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Trash of your caliber actually dares to proclaim yourselves to be a colossus?”

Just when Chu Feng was feeling confused, Fumo Shaoyu burst into laughter.

Once Fumo Shaoyu said those words, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.

It was no wonder Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s Lightning Mark differed from his own.

It would appear that what Fumo Shaoyu had said could very well be truth.

The reason for the difference could very possibly be because the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique Zuoqiu Tiancheng trained in was incomplete.

That said, even though it was incomplete, Chu Feng still had to admit that Zuoqiu Tiancheng had some skills.

After all, once one reached the Utmost Exalted realm, one’s bloodline abilities would once again be sealed.

At the Exalted realm, cultivators were still able to use their bloodline powers and even treasures to increase their cultivations.

Many geniuses were even able to use their bloodline power, special techniques and treasures all at once in order to increase their cultivations by three levels.

However, once one reached the Utmost Exalted realm, not only would the treasures lose their effectiveness, even their bloodline’s power would also be sealed again.

Cultivators capable of unsealing their bloodline power at the Utmost Exalted realm were all extremely powerful existences.

That said, the power of the seal at the Utmost Exalted realm was extremely strong.

Even if someone was able to unseal their bloodline power at the Utmost Exalted realm and increase one’s cultivation with it, their battle power would still suffer in the process.

Take Gu Mingyuan for example.

In the past, Gu Mingyuan had been a genius with fame on par with Chu Feng’s father.

Perhaps her talent might not have been extremely outstanding when placed in the entire Holy Light Galaxy, however she was most definitely a demon-level genius when placed in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

She also had not failed to live up to her reputation as a genius.

She had unsealed her bloodline power at the Utmost Exalted realm, and was able to increase her cultivation using her unsealed bloodline power.

However, even though she was able to increase her cultivation, her battle power after had ended up suffering immensely.

Yet, it was different for Zuoqiu Tiancheng.

Not only did he increase his cultivation, his battle power was also extremely strong.

Even though Fumo Shaoyu and Zuoqiu Tiancheng both possessed rank three Utmost Exalted-level cultivations, Fumo Shaoyu was having some difficulty fighting Zuoqiu Tiancheng.

Although he was having some difficulty, it was not enough that he would be defeated.

As such, Chu Feng did not linger anymore. He immediately descended from the sky and undid Fumo Xin’er’s bonds.

“Chu Feng, how did you and my big brother find me?”

Upon seeing Chu Feng, Fumo Xin’er’s expression changed from one of anger to one of beaming happiness.

Her current appearance was truly lovely, truly charming.

“Your big brother has your tracking talisman on him,” said Chu Feng.

“That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the fact that I was sucked into that space-time vortex. How did you two still manage to find me? Could it be that you were also sucked into the space-time vortex?” asked Fumo Xin’er. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You are simply too impulsive. You shouldn’t have removed your armor.”

“Afraid that something might happen to you, your brother and I immediately removed our armor so that we would also be sucked into a space-time vortex too.”

“However, as our space-time vortexes appeared a little later, we did not exit at the same place.”

“Fortunately, we landed in the same world, and your brother had your tracking talisman on him. Otherwise we really might not have been able to find you.”

“That said, it’s great that you’re fine. That guy shouldn’t have bullied you, right?” asked Chu Feng.

“No, he hasn’t. Whilst he’s definitely a pervert, he lacked the boldness to act on his perverted nature. He didn’t dare do anything to me.”

“If he truly dared to do anything to me, then, even without the two of you, I would’ve made him suffer a miserable death myself,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“You were captured by him, yet you’re still boasting?” laughed Chu Feng.

“Tsk. You don’t know exactly how powerful I am,” Fumo Xin’er raised her chin and refuted.

“The two of you should stop chatting for a while. Brother Chu Feng, come help me take care of this bastard.”

Fumo Shaoyu’s voice sounded from the sky.

“Come, both of you come at me together!”

Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s furious voice was heard soon after.

“You dare attempt to steal my wife? Both of you can forget about living! I will make sure you suffer miserable deaths!”

He had become even more furious.

Perhaps it was because he had learned of Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu’s goal.

It could be seen that he was truly fond of Fumo Xin’er. As such, he would naturally not allow Fumo Shaoyu and Chu Feng to take her away.

However, Chu feng merely smiled at Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s threat. Then, he pointed his finger to the sky.

“Buzz~~~”

As golden light flickered, boundless spirit power soared out from Chu Feng’s finger and into the sky.

The spirit power turned into a rope and, like a flood dragon soaring out of the sea, it shot straight towards Zuoqiu Tiancheng.

“What the hell is this?!”

Zuoqiu Tiancheng realized that something was amiss, and tried to avoid the rope.

However, Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were so powerful that not even rank four Utmost Exalteds would be a match for him.

As such, Zuoqiu Tiancheng, who had only increased his cultivation to that of a rank three Utmost Exalted, would naturally not be a match either.

After the spirit formation rope approached him, it immediately tied him up.

“Little bastard, let’s see you act arrogant again!”

After Zuoqiu Tiancheng was bound, Fumo Shaoyu, who had originally been at a disadvantage, grabbed Zuoqiu Tiancheng and slapped him in the face.

The slap immediately left him with a bloody nose and a swollen face. It had distorted his handsome face considerably.

That said, Fumo Shaoyu was not overly ruthless in teaching Zuoqiu Tiancheng a lesson.

After several slaps to the face, he tossed Zuoqiu Tiancheng onto the mountain peak.

That said, he did not bother to comfort his little sister either. Instead, he turned his gaze onto the palace.

“Brother Chu Feng, did you see that?”

Fumo Shaoyu pointed deep at the group of palaces located on the mountain peak.

What he pointed at was a stone plate.

That stone plate seemed like a seat, yet was not a seat.

Mysterious runes and symbols filled the stone plate. Furthermore, it was suffused with an Ancient Era’s aura.

From a glance, one could tell that it was extraordinary.
