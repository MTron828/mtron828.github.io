Chapter 5695: Eliminate that Old Coot

Chapter 5695: Eliminate that Old Coot

The World Spiritist Immortal King was the creator of Chu Feng’s Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. However, Chu Feng had obtained an imprint together with the cloak, just that it was hidden back then.

According to the World Spiritist Immortal King, if he could channel the power of the nine dragons inside the cloak, the imprint would appear once more. By then, he could march into the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and no one would dare to stop him.

Chu Feng had known that the World Spiritist Immortal King was a formidable figure back then, but he didn’t expect the latter to be the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

Naturally, he didn’t think that he could barge into the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion with a single imprint.

It was only till he arrived at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that he understood why the World Spiritist Immortal King had told him that no one would dare to stop him as long as he had the imprint on him.

The imprint contained a powerful protection formation.

Nothing would happen if the possessor of the imprint remained safe and sound, but should the possessor come under threat, the imprint would bestow tremendous power on them.

…

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion knew how powerful the World Spiritist Immortal King was.

Thirty thousand years ago, before the World Spiritist Immortal King left the Sacred Mansion to wander the world, he had instructed the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to take in anyone bearing the imprint and devote their resources to nurturing them.

However, it was extremely difficult to obtain the imprint. Jie Ranqing was the only one to have obtained it thus far, but she was an anomaly in itself. Many believed that it was impossible for anyone else to obtain the imprint.

Yet, Chu Feng actually carried the imprint with him.

The astonished crowd turned to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

Chu Feng deserved death for what he had done today, but the World Spiritist Immortal King was a revered figure in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion for his contributions, not to mention he was the master of the current Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

Who would dare to defy the World Spiritist Immortal King?

The crowd was curious to know what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master would do in this situation.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master stared intently at Chu Feng’s imprint. He could sense his master’s aura, as well as the formation power from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

His eyes turned dazed as if he had just received the shock of his life. His breathing became hastened, and he looked as if he was going to spew blood once more.

The elders were worried, as they understood how huge this blow was to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master closed his eyes to calm himself. When he finally opened his eyes once more, his gaze and demeanor noticeably changed. He burst into laughter, but his laugh was almost maniacal.

“That explains why you dare to wreak havoc here. You have my master’s imprint. Very well. My master has commanded us to devote all our resources to nurturing anyone who comes to our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. I shan’t defy my master’s will. Since you have the imprint, I’ll give you a chance even though you have killed our people.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master pointed his finger at Chu Feng and sneered, “Kneel down, kowtow, and apologize to me. Admit that your father is a disgusting scoundrel unworthy of my daughter. Admit you’re not worthy to be Ranqing’s child or my grandson. Do as you’re told, and I’ll mercifully give you a chance to join our ranks.”

It was clear from those words that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had no intention of nurturing Chu Feng.

Naturally, Chu Feng caught the drift as well and scoffed in disdain, “You’re misunderstanding something. Your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is rotten to its core. I wouldn’t want to enter this dirty place even if you begged me.”

“Chu Feng, do you think I can’t do anything to you just because you carry my master’s imprint?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“I am standing right here. Try it then, you old coot.”

Old coot?

No one expected Chu Feng to suddenly hurl such an insult at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. In fact, no sane person in the world of cultivation would have the guts to do something like that!

“You lowly trash! I’ll let you know why you’re unworthy to be my grandson!” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master sneered.

He pointed his finger at Chu Feng and unleashed a devastating surge of energy that shook the surrounding space, such that even the strongest experts present felt themselves losing their balance. The juniors even experienced difficulty breathing.

The space above Chu Feng tore open, and an object of tens of thousands of meters in length descended from the sky. A massive formation imprint was falling upon Chu Feng.

The golden light enveloping Chu Feng’s body morphed into a barrier so massive that he looked like a speck of dust in it. What was more formidable was the power it contained; it was far stronger than the starlight energy.

Yet, the barrier distorted when the formation imprint fell on it. Chu Feng even felt some pressure despite being protected by the barrier. The pressure was less than ten-thousandth of the might outside, but it was still hard for someone of Chu Feng’s cultivation to bear.

In the blink of an eye, he was already forced to kneel on one knee. If not for him keeping himself together through sheer willpower, his body might have already broken down.

“As expected of Lord Mansion Master!”

The crowd was overjoyed to see Chu Feng being forced to one knee with a pained look.

Everything Chu Feng had done thus far, from the revelation of his identity, the display of his two bloodlines, the murder of their brethren using their own formations, the clash with the Saint-tier elders, and the revelation of the World Spiritist Immortal King’s imprint, all of these threw mud on the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s reputation.

It embarrassed them, leaving them unable to lift their heads. If Chu Feng got away with what he did today, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s reputation would go down the gutters.

Fortunately, the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was here today. He was the strongest person in the world of cultivation. Be it the starlight energy or the World Spiritist Immortal King’s imprint, there was nothing Chu Feng could do to stop him.

“Damn it!” Chu Feng panicked.

He hadn’t expected the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master to be this powerful. He knew how great the power he received from the imprint was. He would have to cultivate for a long time in order to obtain such power.

But that only served to further drive in how powerful the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was.

As much as he hated that old coot, he had to admit that he was formidable.

Weng!

There was a sudden change in Chu Feng’s imprint. He sensed two different types of energy for him to choose from. He fused his will into the imprint, and the imprint transformed into a small formation on his palm. This formation had ten formation cores.

It was a summoning formation.

“I see.” Chu Feng was overjoyed.

He pressed the small formation onto the ground, and a tremendous surge of spirit power pulsated from the ground. A massive formation surfaced from the feet. Interestingly, its ten formation cores were located right outside of the barrier.

“What’s that? Is that a teleportation formation?”

The elders couldn’t see through the nature of the formation as it was still incomplete, but it didn’t take them long to confirm their conjecture as it began to take shape.

“It is a teleportation formation! He’s planning to escape!” the elders exclaimed.

“He won’t get away,” the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

Whoosh!

Countless chains harnessing overwhelming power whizzed down from the sky and enveloped not just the barrier but the formation too.

“Chu Feng, you shouldn’t even dream of escaping as long as Lord Mansion Master is here,” a red-haired man amidst the crowd insulted.

His words stirred up the others, as they began hurling insults at Chu Feng too.

No one tried to stop them, as they thought that the arrogant Chu Feng needed to be put in place. The elders couldn’t do so as it would be beneath them to do so, but the same couldn’t be said about the juniors and the other members.

“Escape?” Chu Feng’s lips curled up as a vicious gleam flashed across his eyes.

Unbelievable energy burst forth from his body as the formation beneath him began to glow. The world shook intensely, and even space itself distorted.

The space around the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had been reinforced by formation, so its space was extremely stable. It couldn’t be distorted unless by a greater power.

…

Meanwhile, many elders gathered in front of the Seven Realms Challenge Formation were looking in the direction of the Bloodline Square. They had seen the earlier phenomenon and understood that something huge had happened.

However, they couldn’t leave the Saint Mansion because of the orders they had received, so they didn’t know what exactly had happened. They could only turn to an elder floating in the sky for directions.

The elder was around 1.6 meters tall. His face was covered in wrinkles, but his skin was weirdly pale. He had black hair and a beard that flowed for more than ten meters long, which contrasted jarringly against his ghastly white skin.

Most important of all, he gave off a domineering aura.

This elder was not only one of the grand elders who was from the same generation as the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, but also the Ling Clan’s Clan Chief.

He had been in closed-door training in the Sacred Mansion when he was alarmed by the phenomenon. Thinking that the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion was in danger, he barged out of his closed-door training.

His eyes were potent enough to peer through the formation to see what was happening outside the Sacred Mansion, so he knew what was going on in the Bloodline Square.

“What is Chu Feng up to?”

The elder could tell that there was something unusual about Chu Feng’s formation, but he couldn’t determine its use. All of a sudden, he sensed something and turned around.

The other elder did the same too.

It was then that they noticed that the ten warrior sculptures they had been nourishing with powerful formations were emanating blinding golden lights as if they were being awakened. It was the same light as the one shrouding Chu Feng.

“This is bad.”

Sensing that the situation had gone awry, the Ling Clan’s Clan Chief tossed out multiple talismans to form a massive sealing formation, in hopes of tying the ten warrior sculptures down.

Just then, the ten warrior sculptures opened their eyes, and a cloud of dust fell from their bodies. They raised their weapons and sliced through the Ling Clan’s Clan Chief’s sealing formation with ease.

Whoosh!

Then, they rose in the sky and moved at speeds so fast that it looked as if they had vanished into thin air.

At the same time, the formation beneath Chu Feng’s feet glowed with a brilliant light. The ten formation cores pulsated a terrifying aura that felt as if something formidable was being awakened.

Before the crowd’s horrified gazes, a sonic boom echoed from the distance.

The surrounding space suddenly jolted, and the juniors toppled to the ground. Some of the elders were unable to maintain their balance too.

There were a total of ten jolts.

When everything finally calmed down, the crowd got another shock of their life.

Ten armored warrior sculptures, each standing at a height exceeding a thousand meters, had appeared on the Bloodline Square. Their auras were comparable to that of pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritists, putting them stronger than the Saint-tier elders.

Chu Feng turned to the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and ordered, “Awakened warriors, heed my command. Eliminate that old coot!”
