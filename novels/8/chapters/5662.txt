Chapter 5662: The Dazed Xia Xingchen

As the runes flowed into Chu Feng’s body, he slowly came to grasp the complete Immemorial Meditation Method. That was why he knew this was an opportunity not to be missed.

The Immemorial Meditation Method was a cultivation method tailored for world spiritists, and it needed to be constantly practiced over time. However, there was a chance to significantly boost one’s psyche the first time one practiced the method, and this was no normal psyche boost.

It was a fortuitous encounter in itself, and Chu Feng was determined to grasp it.

The first thing he did upon receiving the complete Immemorial Meditation Method was to open his eyes and activate Heaven’s Eye. He could sense that his Heaven’s Eye had been enhanced, but more than that, his senses and control over spirit power had been boosted too.

And this was only the initial benefit of obtaining the Immemorial Meditation Method. He could further strengthen his psyche as long as he continued practicing it. It wouldn’t directly raise his spirit power, but it would bolster the foundation required for him to make a breakthrough.

It was similar to how cultivators amassed martial power for the impetus for a breakthrough, just that the foundation for world spiritists was their psyche. A world spiritist without sufficient psyche would struggle to make a breakthrough.

Now that he had the Immemorial Meditation Method, Chu Feng’s path as a world spiritist would become much smoother.

He stood up and looked at Xia Xingchen with a grim expression.

“Did you fail?” Xia Xingchen asked.

Chu Feng let out a sigh.

“It’s fine, lad. The Immemorial Meditation Method is not easy to grasp. You have done great compared to the others. I shan’t take advantage of you. It’s out of convenience that I brought you along anyway. Since you weren’t able to grasp the Immemorial Meditation Method, you need not help me with the formation. You may leave now,” Xia Xingchen said.

It was then Chu Feng burst into laughter. “Elder, I’ll have to disappoint you. I’m going to help you by hook or by crook.”

“Lad, there’s no need for that. I, Xia Xingchen, don’t take advantage of others.” Xia Xingchen initially rejected Chu Feng’s goodwill, but the latter’s smile sparked a thought in her mind. “No, there’s something wrong about that smile of yours. Did you… succeed?”

She blinked her eyes in uncertainty, not knowing if her deduction was true.

“The Immemorial Meditation Method is indeed good stuff,” Chu Feng replied with a grin.

“You brat! Why didn’t you say so if you did comprehend the Immemorial Meditation Method?” Xia Xingchen was both infuriated and delighted. She marched up to Chu Feng and smacked his arm. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“But elder, I didn’t say that I failed,” Chu Feng replied indignantly.

“Cut the act. I asked you whether you succeeded earlier, but you didn’t reply and even sighed. You were obviously implying that you failed! Still, I have to say that I’m quite surprised. Chu Feng, do you know that no one has grasped the Immemorial Meditation method thus far? You’re the first one to succeed,” Xia Xingchen said.

“Oh? Was no one from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion able to grasp it?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course not! How could we allow those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion here? Our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect isn’t on hostile terms with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but they are still a potential rival. There’s no way we would share our resources with a rival and bulk up their strength. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion doesn’t know about the existence of the Immemorial Meditation Method at all.

“I suppose if you are able to comprehend the Immemorial Meditation Method, the prodigies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion should be able to do so too…” Xia Xingchen’s words trailed off in uncertainty before adding on, “Are you stronger than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s juniors?”

“I’m not sure,” Chu Feng replied.

“Looks like you’re at least humble. I’ve met the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, including Ling Xiao. I have to concede that none of our sect’s juniors can compete with him in terms of world spiritist techniques, but somehow, he doesn’t seem as formidable as you are,” Xia Xingchen said.

“Thank you for your acknowledgement. You have a good eye for people,” Chu Feng replied.

“Don’t get too smug either. You can’t be the only person in the world who can comprehend the Immemorial Meditation Method. I know of at least one other person from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who can comprehend it,” Xia Xingchen said.

“Who is it?”

“Jie Ranqing.”

“I have no doubt about that. Lord Jie Ranqing would surely be able to do it,” Chu Feng agreed with a smile before turning his attention to the formation. “Elder, should we begin now?”

“Brat, it’ll be really painful,” Xia Xingchen reminded him.

“Let’s start. They might really send reinforcements if we continue dilly-dallying,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll be starting then,” Xia Xingchen said.

She took out a stone amulet that was a treasure of greater value than the stone key. It contained a great amount of spirit power. When she channeled the stone amulet, the surroundings walls began to glow, and countless inscriptions surfaced and emanated spirit power.

The spirit power intersected and manifested into the primary form of a formation. Chu Feng walked into the formation and sat down.

“Brat, how did you know that’s the formation core?” Xia Xingchen was taken aback.

Putting aside the formation had an unusual design, it hadn’t even fully taken shape yet. It shouldn’t have been possible for Chu Feng to decipher where the formation core was.

“Elder, I am able to grasp even the Immemorial Meditation Method. There’s no way I would know nothing about this place at all.”

“You sound like you know a lot. Can you channel the formation without me then?” Xia Xingchen asked.

“I can give it a try,” Chu Feng replied with a smile as he formed a hand seal.

The formation’s spirit power moved at his command, and the formation began to take shape.

Xia Xingchen was stunned. She was reminded of a profoundly talented man whom she had met many years back, just that the man’s talent was in martial cultivation whereas Chu Feng’s talent was in formations.

She soon broke into a smile and tightly grasped the stone amulet. She began forming hand seals as well as she said, “Don’t even think that you can outdo me. This is my home turf!”

The stone amulet in her hand glowed brightly as tremendous spirit power surged out from it and fused with the formation. This greatly hastened the construction speed of the formation.
