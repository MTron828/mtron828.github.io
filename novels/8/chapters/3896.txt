Chapter 3896 - A Major Transaction

“That’s true.”

“Since that’s the case, I will tell you all my secret too.”

Afterwards, Chu Feng told the Mystic Cave Saints his real name, that he belonged to the Chu Heavenly Clan, and about his grudges with the All-heaven Sect.

“So your name is Chu Feng. That name doesn’t sound good. I think Asura is a more imposing name.”

“Right, right, right. You should change your name to Asura,” the Mystic Cave Saints said after learning about Chu Feng.

“What is with you all? That shouldn’t be important, no?”

Chu Feng felt helpless after being confronted with the Mystic Cave Saints acting in such a manner.

Chu Feng had opened his heart and told them about the secrets he’d hidden. Yet, they were actually saying his name being unpleasant to hear?

What did his secret have to do with whether or not his name sounded good?

“Haha. We’re merely joking.”

“Brother Asura, we truly never would’ve expected you to possess such an enormous hatred against the All-heaven Sect.”

“That All-heaven Sect is truly vile. They actually secretly meddled with the matters of another starfield. They’re simply too shameless.”

“It’s no wonder you dislike them so much.”

“Since that’s the case, we’ve decided that we’ll conduct a big transaction. Brother Asura, are you willing to conduct that transaction with us?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“It would appear that your so-called major transaction is related to the All-heaven Sect?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right, it is related to the All-heaven Sect,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Tell me about it,” said Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, did you know that the starfields of the Holy Light Galaxy differ in strength?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“There are a total of ninety-six starfields in the Holy Light Galaxy.”

“Among them, fifty are Lower Starfields, thirty are Middle Starfields, and six are Upper Starfields.”

“The remaining ten, due to being too weak, are known as Abandoned Starfields.”

“Those ten starfields are not even qualified to participate in the Holy Light Galaxy’s grand occasions. These ten Abandoned Starfields include the All-heaven Starfield and the Ancestral Martial Starfield that I belong to," said Chu Feng.

“Who would’ve imagined that you actually know this much.” The Mystic Cave Saints revealed looks of praise after hearing Chu Feng’s words.

As for Chu Feng, he smiled proudly.

Only he knew that he actually didn’t know much about those things. It was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist who had told him about that.

Thinking about that, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from gasping with admiration at how different it was to have a powerful guide. At the very least, one would be able to become much more knowledgeable. It was a pity that he was unable to ask the Ox-nosed Old Daoist more things.

Even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist wanted him to become his disciple, Chu Feng had no desire to become his disciple.

“Even amongst the Abandoned Starfields, there’s a difference in power.”

“In two months’ time, a grand occasion will take place in the All-heaven Sect.”

“Do you know what sort of grand occasion it is?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Just stop beating around the bush and tell me what it is,” said Chu Feng. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Hehe, I’m merely trying to make things feel slightly mysterious. Since you’re so boring, I’ll just tell you directly.”

Afterwards, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints roughly told Chu Feng about what would happen in two weeks.

The All-heaven Starfield and five other starfields had once joined hands to breach a remnant.

They had obtained a lot of treasures from that remnant. Among them, one treasure was the most precious of all.

There was only one such treasure. Furthermore, it could not be divided.

However, if they were to determine who would obtain that treasure through martial power, it would be somewhat inappropriate too.

In the end, they decided to have their younger generations compete with one another.

Whoever’s younger generation was more competent would be the one to obtain the treasure.

There was actually a reason why they had decided to settle on that.

The reason for that was because that treasure would form a spirit formation space once it was opened.

Although no one knew what the actual treasure was, they knew that the actual treasure was hidden inside that spirit formation space.

Unfortunately, there was a restriction to that spirit formation space. Only people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age would be able to enter it.

That was the reason why they’d decided to make such a decision.

Actually, it was because they had no choice.

In two months, apart from the All-heaven Sect, five more Overlord-level powers from five Abandoned Starfields would arrive at the All-heaven Sect.

That was the grand occasion the Mystic Cave Saints spoke of.

“You all are trying to use that treasure of yours that is capable of deceiving spirit formations to pretend to be people of the younger generation to sneak into that spirit formation and rob that treasure?” asked Chu Feng.

“That was what we had originally planned to do. However, that treasure they’ve excavated is something from an Ancient Era’s remnant. We still do not know exactly how powerful its spirit formation space is.”

“We brothers are actually uncertain as to whether or not we’ll be able to sneak our way in there.”

“However, if brother Asura is willing, you’ll totally be able to enter it. After all, you’re a person of the younger generation,” said the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Right, right, right. That treasure is from an Ancient Era’s remnant.”

“Furthermore, the All-heaven Sect considered that Ancient Era’s remnant to be even more important than the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.”

“The most important treasure in that Ancient Era’s remnant was that treasure.”

“Not to mention the All-heaven Sect, the other five starfields also deeply value that treasure.”

“If you are to snatch that treasure away, you’ll definitely infuriate the All-heaven Sect,” said the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Looking forward to that even more than the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb? Is that remnant really that powerful?”

Chu Feng was rather surprised. After all, he felt that, with how exceptional of a person the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was, his inheritance would definitely be exceptionally amazing.

“Cough, cough. It’s because of this. There are multiple Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tombs in the Holy Light Galaxy.”

“The tomb here is deemed to be a fake. The reason why it is deemed to be fake is because there have been legends about the treasures in this tomb all these years. Yet, the treasures in this tomb were very different from the treasures that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor used in the past.”

“Because of that, this tomb has been deemed a fake from the very start. Even though it was certain that there were treasures in this tomb, those treasures were not especially precious.”

“Otherwise, with the reputation the Great Monster Slayer Emperor had when he was alive, how could the colossuses of the Holy Light Galaxy be willing to disregard it?”

“It is because everyone determined this tomb to be a fake that those colossuses didn’t pay attention to it. In turn, the All-heaven Sect was given the opportunity to open this tomb.”

“However, no one expected this tomb to be real. Unfortunately, brother Asura, for the sake of saving us, you’ve renounced the inheritances. We’ve... truly let you down.”

After saying those words, the Mystic Cave Saints all looked very ashamed.

“Brother Asura, please take this.”

Suddenly, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints handed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng accepted the Cosmos Sack and examined it. He discovered that the Cosmos Sack contained treasures.

The treasures in the Cosmos Sack were not only limited to the treasures with the aura of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb, but there were also other treasures. The other treasures were naturally the Mystic Cave Saints’ personal treasures.

For the sake of making up to Chu Feng, the Mystic Cave Saints had not only placed all the treasures they’d snatched from the All-heaven Sect into the Cosmos Sack, but they’d even taken some of their own treasures and placed them into the Cosmos Sack too.

It could be seen that they felt truly guilty for causing Chu Feng to abandon his inheritances.

After all, they were the Mystic Cave Saints, people who considered treasures to be more important than their lives.

“This would be rather unreasonable.” Chu Feng tossed the Cosmos Sack back to the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Brother Asura, you must accept it,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Right, you must accept it,” echoed the others of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“There’s no need. I’ve obtained more than you all.”

“Clank~~~”

As Chu Feng spoke, he flicked his wrist, and the Great Monster Slaying Sword appeared in his hand.

“Look carefully, what is this?” he asked with a smile.

“Heavens! Is that not the Monster Slaying Sword?!”

The Mystic Cave Saints actually snatched the sword from Chu Feng’s hand.

The eleven of them began to caress the sword nonstop. They were simply admiring it so much that they were reluctant to part with it.
