Chapter 4421: Utmost Disdain

At this very moment, be it the pair from the Yu Heavenly Clan or the pair from the Monstrous Herd Temple, they weren’t hiding their cultivation at all, so Chu Feng was able to perceive the depths of their strength clearly.

They had reached the same level as Long Xiaoxiao in terms of cultivation, rank six Utmost Exalted level!

That was quite an incredible feat for those of their age group.

One must know that the strongest expert of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Long Daozhi, was only at rank six Utmost Exalted level too.

And the reason why Long Daozhi was able to become so powerful, other than his superior talent, was also because he had devoted thousands of years to his cultivation.

However, those who were present here were all from the younger generation and were beneath a hundred years in age.

This was a short time compared to the thousands of years that older cultivators had devoted to their training, but nevertheless, they were still able to come so far within such a short period of time.

From this, their talents were really as great as how the rumors put them out to be.

“The lady from the Dragon Clan sure is pleasing to the eye.”

At this very moment, both the pair from the Yu Heavenly Clan and the pair from the Monstrous Herd Temple were assessing Long Xiaoxiao intently.

Long Xiaoxiao had an exquisite face, snowy-white skin, and long and slender legs, making her very pleasing to the eye. The four men in the clearing were full of praises for her appearance.

But soon, they turned their sights over to Chu Feng, and a slight frown formed on their foreheads.

This was especially so for the pair form the Yu Heavenly Clan. Their eyes were filled with disdain for him.

They couldn’t be blamed for reacting in such a manner.

There was a mysterious expert who had threatened Chu Feng not to disguise himself before the rest of the world, or else both Zhao Hong and the Chu Heavenly Clan would face a calamity. As such, he dared not to conceal his appearance behind a mask.

In any case, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and the others had already learned that his appearance had been ruined, so there was no point hiding it anymore. So, he chose to toss aside his mask and show his true face.

It was just that the face he was showing was extremely ugly.

When a person as beautiful as Long Xiaoxiao stood beside the currently hideous Chu Feng, it formed a stark contrast that was almost reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast.

“Why would there be such an ugly person within the Dragon Clan?”

“Can’t he find a world spiritist and alter his appearance? Or at the very least, he should have the decency to wear a mask!”

“There are plenty of ugly people amongst the monstrous beast, but we’ve never seen someone as ugly as this before!”

The four people from the Yu Heavenly Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple began criticizing Chu Feng’s appearance, as if his ugliness had sullied their eyes.

Despite so, Chu Feng was unfazed. He had already mentally prepared himself for this.

Those who were able to come here had to be the most outstanding juniors of the Yu Heavenly Clan or the Monstrous Herd Temple. Most geniuses shared a commonality, and that was arrogance.

They were highly valued for their talents, so they were often accorded preferential treatment over their peers. This inevitably led to them becoming egotistical, never hesitating to make their disdain for another person known.

There was no way they would have good words for Chu Feng. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“What business of it is yours how he looks like?”

But even though Chu Feng thought nothing of it, Long Xiaoxiao couldn’t tolerate seeing him suffer such a grievance.

The eyes of the lass turned particularly sharp as she glared at the four people clearing. On top of that, she even released her oppressive might at them.

A furious might swept across the trees around the clearing, causing them to sway so violently that it looked like they were going to be uprooted.

It felt like a battle was just brewing around the corner.

“Hoho, rank six Utmost Exalted level? I didn’t think a young lass like you would actually be so remarkable. It looks like the Dragon Clan isn’t as pathetic as I thought. I just wonder how powerful that hideous creature is.”

One of the men from the Yu Heavenly Clan glanced at Chu Feng as he spoke.

He didn’t carry any enmity toward Long Xiaoxiao; on the contrary, he had a deep appreciation for her talent. He simply felt deep loathing for Chu Feng.

“You still dare to spout nonsense? You think I dare not make a move against you?” Long Xiaoxiao bellowed.

Her oppressive might seemed to morph into a ferocious beast as it raced toward the man from the Yu Heavenly Clan.

Facing Long XIaoxiao’s hostility, the man also didn’t express any fear. With a light harrumph, he released his oppressive might too.

Boom!

The two oppressive mights clashed with one another, causing terrifying shockwaves to ripple into the surroundings, plunging the surroundings into devastation.

Despite so, there was not a person present who was affected by the shockwave.

“Young lady, what are you doing? I’m talking about that hideous creature, not you. Why are you so defensive about him? Is he your husband?

“It can’t be, right? A person of your standing and beauty can’t possibly be so blind as to choose such a hideous creature as your husband,” the man from the Yu Heavenly Clan remarked teasingly.

“Shut your mouth. He’s my benefactor. If you dare to speak another word of insult about him, I’ll make you pay the price for your insolence!” Long Xiaoxiao bellowed in displeasure.

“Benefactor? A person like him?” the man of the Yu Heavenly Clan sneered coldly.

He turned to Chu Feng and said, “Are you a man or not? If you’re a man, you shouldn’t hide behind the back of a woman! If you have any sliver of pride at all, have a fight with me!”

Klang!

Right after those words were spoken, Long Xiaoxiao flicked her wrist and whipped out a golden sword with a dragon inscribed on it.

The appearance of the sword immediately strengthened Long Xiaoxiao’s aura further.

It was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.

“Apologize to my benefactor right away!” Long Xiaoxiao demanded severely.

“And if I refuse?” the man from the Yu Heavenly Clan asked coldly.

“Then I’ll rip your mouth from your face!” Long Xiaoxiao said.

“Hmph, what arrogant words! Do you think that we really fear you?”

The two men from the Yu Heavenly Clan sneered coldly as they drew a silver sword and a silver axe each.

Both weapons had unique runes inscribed on them, and devastating lightning crackled around them. The auras of the two men immediately rose.

However, Long Xiaoxiao showed no signs of backing down either. It looked as if a ferocious fight would break out between them at any moment.

“I must say, Yu Hong and Yu Yin, why are the two of you making a move against the princess of the Dragon Clan?”

All of a sudden, a man’s voice sounded from the forest.

Without even glancing over, everyone present knew that the person who had just spoken came from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect. Nevertheless, they still turned their eyes over.

And upon taking a look, joy broke out within Chu Feng’s heart.

The ones who had just arrived were indeed from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, as could be seen from the clothes they wore. However, unlike the other disciples Chu Feng had met previously, they didn’t have mist around them concealing their appearance.

Their appearances could be seen clearly before Chu Feng’s eyes.

They were a pair of man and woman.

The man had a stout physique and a masculine face. He emanated an air of valiance, and it was apparent with a look that he was a dragon amidst men.

The woman, on the other hand, was extremely beautiful, and she was a person whom Chu Feng recognized—Yin Zhuanghong.

“Miss Yin, you’re here too.”

Chu Feng was delighted to see Yin Zhuanghong, and he immediately walked up to her.

Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong were close friends who had been through difficult times together. It had been some time since they had parted with one another, and Chu Feng had been worried about Yin Zhuanghong all this while.

So, when he heard from the disciples of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect that Yin Zhuanghong was originally one of their own, not to mention the personal disciple of their sectmaster, his heart finally settled down a little.

However, he still couldn’t help but still feel a little uncertain about the matter. He couldn’t bring himself to fully trust the words of another.

So, he was extremely delighted to see that Yin Zhuanghong was doing well at the moment.

But as Chu Feng approached her in agitation, Yin Zhuanghong backed away with a frown.

“Who are you? Do I know you?” Yin Zhuanghong asked as she eyed Chu Feng warily.

“What are you doing?”

The dashing male disciple of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect walked forward and stepped in between Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong. There was a hostile glint in his eyes.

“You aren’t Yin Zhuanghong?” Chu Feng asked doubtfully.

“Yin Zhuanghong?”

Both the man and ‘Yin Zhuanghong’ were surprised to hear those words coming from Chu Feng’s mouth.

“You know my elder sister?” ‘Yin Zhuanghong’ asked.

In truth, from the moment that the woman started speaking, Chu Feng had already noticed that she wasn’t Yin Zhuanghong. While their appearances looked very alike to one another, there was still some discrepancy in their voices.

And the fact that the woman was calling Yin Zhuanghong her sister was more than enough to reveal her identity.

“Yin Zhuanghong is your elder sister?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, that’s right. She’s my blood-related elder sister,” the woman replied.

“Are the two of you twins?” Chu Feng asked.

“Is that not obvious?” the woman replied.

“No wonder. That would explain why you look so similar to her. May I know how I should address you?” Chu Feng asked.

“My name is Yin Daifen,” the woman replied.

“My apologies, Miss Yin. You simply look too alike to your elder sister, so I ended up making a mistake here,” Chu Feng clasped his fist as he spoke.

“You really know my elder sister? What’s your name?” Yin Daifen asked.

“My name is Chu Feng,” Chu Feng replied.

“Chu Feng? You aren’t from the Dragon Clan?” Yin Daifen asked.

“No, I’m not from the Dragon Clan. I came from the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Chu Heavenly Clan,” Chu Feng replied.

He knew that Xianhai Shaoyu had already moved the current Chu Heavenly Clan to a safe location, so no matter who he offended now, he didn’t have to worry about those people exacting vengeance on his clan members.

So, there was no reason why he couldn’t report his own background.

After all, regardless of whether his clan was powerful or weak, it was still the place where he had come from. It was his root and origin.

“What Ancestral Martial Starfield?”

“Isn’t that a Lower Starfield?”

As soon as Chu Feng said those words, the two men from the Monstrous Herd Temple exclaimed in astonishment.

“No, the Ancestral Martial Starfield is not a Lower Starfield but an Abandoned Starfield. You can pretty much say that it’s trash. It’s the weakest starfield of our Holy Light Galaxy, a stain in our reputation,” one of the two men from the Yu Heavenly Clan said.

Upon hearing those words, everyone present looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with utmost disdain.

Even Yin Daifen wasn’t an exception to that.
