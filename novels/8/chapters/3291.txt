Chapter 3291 - Sacred Cultivation Ground

Although there were waves surging in the crowd‚Äôs hearts in the moment Chu Feng was granted the Death Exemption Title Plate, none of them dared to say anything, even if there were things that which they wanted to say after facing such an unyielding attitude from the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief.

After all, they also knew that Chu Feng‚Äôs talent was truly exceptional. Now, he had opened all eight of the Bloodline Cultivation Formations and accomplished an unprecedented magnificent feat. Chu Feng‚Äôs accomplishment was a service of enormous merit.

To have made such a contribution to their Chu Heavenly Clan, it was only natural that he would receive a Death Exemption Title Plate.

However, ordinary Death Exemption Title Plates would only be able to grant a single exemption to death. Furthermore, even if it could exempt one from death, if one‚Äôs mistake were too gargantuan, one would still be punished.

According to the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief, Chu Feng‚Äôs life and death was actually unrelated to the Death Exemption Title Plate. Regardless of whether the Death Exemption Title Plate was present or not, Chu Feng would, from that day day onward, receive an unkillable status within the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Not to mention being exempted from death should he commit offenses, he would not even be punished should he end up committing some sort of offense.

In short, Chu Feng would henceforth be able to do whatever he wanted in the Chu Heavenly Clan, and no one would dare to punish him. Even if he were to willfully slaughter the innocent, do some sort of outrageous act or even betray their clan, no one could punish him.

Such protection was truly an act of excessive spoiling.

This sort of spoiling was something that even bystanders were able to tell. As for Chu Feng, he was naturally extremely moved.

That said, he did not bother to say any excessive words of thanks. Instead, he firmly remembered the affection of the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief. He was planning to use actions to repay this affection.

As the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief had placed high hopes on him, what Chu Feng would have to do would be to live up to those great expectations.

Merely, what Chu Feng planned to do might even surpass the expectations of the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief.

The reason for that was because what Chu Feng needed to do was to accomplish the final wishes of their Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Old Ancestor, and lead their Chu Heavenly Clan to become the ruler‚Äôs of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Merely, he did not dare to mention it. Not to mention the fact that he would bring about a calamity should he mention it, even if he did mention it, no one would believe him.

Although the Chu Heavenly Clan might be the ruler of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they were completely insignificant when placed in the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Become the ruler of the Ancestral Martial Starfield? That was simply akin to a dream, something completely unattainable.

With the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations opened, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all incomparably excited, and eager to immediately enter them to train.

However, even though the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations had opened simultaneously, it remained that only a limited amount of people could enter them at once.

Logically, it would be the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief, the Supreme Elders, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the other upper echelons of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the people that had the most authority, status and battle power in the Chu Heavenly Clan, that would be qualified to enter the Bloodline Cultivation Formations first.

However, an exception was made this time around. Chu Feng accompanied the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief and the Supreme Elders, as well as the various Hall Masters and Vice Hall Masters, into the Bloodline Cultivation Formations to train.

To receive this sort of treatment, not to mention the people of the younger generation, even the people that had lived for thousands of years and become elders of the Chu Heavenly Clan felt envious.

After all, the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations had opened simultaneously. With this, the power contained within them should be extremely strong.

Although the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations would now remain open forever, and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen would all have the opportunity to enter them to train, they all wished to enter and experience the strong power contained within the Bloodline Cultivation Formations right away.

That said, while they felt envious of Chu Feng, no one said anything. After all, the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations were opened by Chu Feng. Not to mention them, even their Lord Clan Chief and those Supreme Elders were only able to enjoy such great fortune thanks to him.

That said, he only entered the Bloodline Cultivation Formation for a short while before coming out. Visjt nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for new updates

The reason why he came out was because he discovered that the simultaneous opening of the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations had indeed strengthened the power of the spirit formation by a lot.

However, they did not provide much assistance to him.

The reason for that was because the martial comprehension contained within the Bloodline Cultivation Formation was very complicated, and the natural energies contained within them were actually at the Exalted level.

In other words, the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations would provide enormous assistance to Exalted-level experts.

The Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Hanqing and Chu Xuanzhengfa , the strongest battle power of the Chu Heavenly Clan, would all receive miraculous effects by training in the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations.

One must know that on the path of martial cultivation, the higher one‚Äôs cultivation was, the more difficult it would be to reach a breakthrough. For the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations to provide a miraculous effect for Exalted-level experts would make it a sacred cultivation ground.

If this matter were to become known to others, there would definitely be powerful clans that would come to plunder the sacred cultivation ground from the Chu Heavenly Clan. It might even be possible for the Starfield Master Realm to desire to appropriate this place as their own.

At present. the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations were most definitely the most precious cultivation ground of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, there were two sides to everything. There was a disadvantage for every advantage.

Although the Bloodline Cultivation Formation had miraculous effects for Exalted-level experts, it did not assist those below the Exalted realm much.

That was the reason why Chu Feng immediately came out.

However, after he exited the the Bloodline Cultivation Formation, he discovered that the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Hanqing, and Chu Xuanzhengfa were all outside.

Furthermore, they were all standing together with serious expressions on their face. They seemed to be discussing something. However, they were conversing through voice transmission. Thus, Chu Feng had no idea what they were discussing.

‚ÄúChu Feng, why did you come out too?‚Äù Seeing Chu Feng, the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief was quite surprised.

‚ÄúSenior, the Bloodline Cultivation Formations are truly imposing. I have never witnessed such dense natural energies before. Unfortunately, Exalted-level martial power is too pure. It made it so that Immortal-level martial power is lacking in the Bloodline Cultivation Formations. As such, the Bloodline Cultivation Formations are not of much assistance to me,‚Äù Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Hearing that response, the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng and Chu Xuanzhengfa glanced at one another. Immediately, they came to an understanding.

After all, they‚Äôd also entered the Bloodline Cultivation Formations. Thus, they knew about the situation inside. However, they were only basking in the joy of the great power possessed by the Bloodline Cultivation Formations and had neglected the fact that the Bloodline Cultivation Formations actually did not provide much assistance to those below the Exalted realm.

‚ÄúThe two of you can go,‚Äù The Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief waved his hand.

Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng immediately bowed and left.

That said, they did not return to the Bloodline Cultivation Formations that they‚Äôd entered before, Instead, they each entered a new Bloodline Cultivation Formation.

It seemed like they did not leave to train. Instead, they seemed to have to accomplish some sort of important matter.

At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs Clan Chief arrived before Chu Feng. He smiled and said, ‚ÄúChu Feng, you have truly provided outstanding service to our Chu Heavenly Clan. I truly do not know how to reward you for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSenior, you‚Äôre flattering me. This Chu Feng has merely done what should be done. As for a reward, senior has already bestowed the Death Exemption Title Plate upon me. How could there be a better reward than that?‚Äù Chu Feng replied with a smile.
