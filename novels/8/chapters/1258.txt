MGA: Chapter 1259 - Mutual Assistance

At this moment, wave upon wave of screams from that Punishment Department’s management elder resounded through the sky. Each scream was more miserable than the last. Yet, each scream was also weaker than the last.

“Spare me, please, I beg of you, don’t do this,” Finally, that Punishment Department’s management elder was unable to bear the soul-penetrating torment and began to beg Bai Suyan for forgiveness.

However, Bai Suyan ignored him completely. With a light smile on her face, she continued on with what she was doing.

Her smile was extremely beautiful. It was both mature and charming. Looking at that smile, one would immediately be charmed by her. Yet, when one saw what she was actually doing right now and then looked back to her smile, one would feel an indescribable fear.

“I’ve truly underestimated her. This woman’s pretty frightening,” Eggy suddenly said with a smile.

“Eggy, what do you mean by that?” Chu Feng was able to tell that there were hidden implications in Eggy’s words.

“To directly absorb another’s source energy is one thing. However, she is actually able to directly absorb another’s cultivation. That is definitely not something that any Half Martial Emperor could do. It is a very sinister and ruthless method.”

“That Bai Suyan is most definitely not a virtuous individual. Fortunately, she is not your enemy. Otherwise, if the current you were to encounter an enemy like her, it would be truly frightening,” Eggy said.

After hearing what Eggy said, Chu Feng had a whole new level of respect for Bai Suyan once again. At the same time, he managed to become aware of how dangerous she was.

Finally, Bai Suyan released her palm. As for that Punishment Department’s management elder, he fell from the sky the moment she released her palm and firmly crashed onto the ground.

The current Punishment Department’s management elder had lost all of his cultivation and life force. Even his source energy had been completely absorbed.

Thus, his current body was no different from that of an ordinary person. He had lost his indestructible Half Martial Emperor body.

At the moment when he crashed into the ground, a loud ‘bang’ was heard. The impact of the landing completely shattered his internal organs, broke all of his bones and left him badly mutilated.

Not long ago, he possessed an extremely powerful might. Yet, at this moment, his appearance was truly and pitifully tragic. At the moment before his death, he had experienced his life’s most painful torture, and had all that he possessed sucked out from him when he was still alive.

And all of this was done by Bai Suyan!!!

“Gulp.”

Seeing this scene, even Sima Ying, this girl who acted very strong, was unable to help herself from gulping down a mouthful of saliva. She was scared by Bai Suyan’s methods.

“Come children, let’s go,” Bai Suyan calmly turned around and lightly smiled at them. Her appearance was as if nothing at all had happened.

Suddenly, Bai Ruochen spoke. “Mother, daughter has one thing that she wishes to ask you.”

“Ruochen, what is it, go ahead and tell me. There is no need for you to be so reserved with your mother,” Bai Suyan asked with a smile.

“Mother, we do not wish to return to the Ascension Sect,” Bai Ruochen said.

“Ruochen, with the current situation, you still plan to return to the Cyanwood Mountain? You must know that it is not safe at all to stay in that place,” Bai Suyan said.

“Mother, I am aware of that. Thus... we wish to go to the Alliance Domain,” Bai Ruochen said.

“Alliance Domain?” Hearing those words, Bai Suyan was slightly surprised. From her stunned expression, one could tell that she did not expect Bai Ruochen’s decision.

“Mother, can we do that?” Bai Ruochen was a bit nervous. She appeared to be worried that her mother would not agree to it.

“Let’s return to the Ascension Sect and discuss this afterwards,” After Bai Suyan finished saying those words, she waved her sleeve and a layer of energy covered Chu Feng and the others. After that, Bai Suyan turned into a flash of light, and the layer of energy covering Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying began to accompany her and rapidly fly through the sky.

From this, Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying were all able to tell that Bai Suyan was hesitant of Bai Ruochen’s decision. The reason why she did not give them an answer right away was most likely because she wanted to think about it.

Thus, Chu Feng and the others did not try to ask about the matter anymore. Instead, they decided to return to the Ascension Sect with Bai Suyan first.

After all, from the current situation, it was clear that the Cyanwood Mountain’s Punishment Department was not planning to let them go that easily.

If Chu Feng’s group was to hastily depart at such a time, it would be extremely dangerous. Thus, it would be much safer for them to follow Bai Suyan.

When they returned to the Ascension Sect, not only was the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster present, even the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster Sikong Zhaixing and the various management elders were present as well.

Both the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster and Sikong Zhaixing had expressions of worry on their faces. It was clear that the two of them had heard about the bitter experience that Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen had in the Cyanwood Mountain.

However, after the two of them sensed Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen’s current cultivations, they started to calm down and became delighted. The two of them had no choice but to admit that the speed at which these two children increased their cultivation was truly fast. At the very least, it was much faster than they had been in their youth.

After returning to the Ascension Sect, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster first held a welcome dinner for Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying to wash away the dust from their journey.

After the feast, Chu Feng chatted with Sikong Zhaixing, and only returned to the residence provided to him by the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster when night came.

Merely, when Chu Feng returned to his residence, he was shocked to find that, other than the servant girls, another person had appeared in his residence. It was Bai Ruochen’s mother, Bai Suyan.

Bai Suyan was still wearing her red-colored miniskirt. She was sitting beside the window with one leg over the other. As the moonlight shone on her fair and jade-like legs and reflected a slight bit of light off them, it was truly alluring.

Chu Feng did not dare to look at Bai Suyan too much. Even though he was a man and also enjoyed beauties, it remained that Bai Suyan was Bai Ruochen’s mother. To Chu Feng, Bai Suyan was his senior. Furthermore, Chu Feng was one to know about the basic respect that a junior should have toward one’s senior.

Thus, when Chu Feng saw Bai Suyan, he did not try to stare at her and instead deliberately shifted his gaze elsewhere. Only then did he say, “For senior to wait for Chu Feng here, is there something that you need?”

“Wasn’t it you who wanted to find me because you needed something?” Bai Suyan’s eyes narrowed slightly. An unfathomable smile appeared on her charming face.

“Needed something?” Chu Feng was puzzled.

“Ruochen has already told me that the three of you wanted to go to the Alliance Domain. Furthermore, you wanted to go there urgently. However, because of the Boundary Energy, you three are incapable of going there and thus wanted my help.” Bai Suyan said with a smile. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Senior, you’re willing to help us?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course I am willing,” Bai Suyan replied with a smile. As she spoke, she stood up and began to walk toward Chu Feng.

“Thank you, senior,” Hearing that, Chu Feng hurriedly expressed his thanks to Bai Suyan.

“Sigh, don’t express your thanks so urgently,” However, before Chu Feng could cup his fist and bow to express his thanks, Bai Suyan suddenly extended her lily-white hands, stopped his arms and pushed him back up.

Even though Bai Suyan was Bai Ruochen’s mother, her skin was extremely well-maintained. She did not use special methods to maintain her skin. Instead, her skin was naturally beautiful.

Thus, at the moment when Bai Suyan’s jade-like hands touched Chu Feng’s arm, a tingling sensation immediately rushed through Chu Feng’s body, causing his hair to stand on end. Chu Feng hurriedly removed himself from Bai Suyan’s hands and stepped back two steps. He did not dare to have too close of a contact with Bai Suyan.

To Chu Feng, Bai Suyan was not only Bai Ruchen’s mother, she was also the Ascension Sect sectmaster’s wife. Thus, he should not be excessively close to Bai Suyan.

Furthermore, even when not mentioning their respective statuses, Bai Suyan was also an extremely dangerous individual who possessed an unfathomable strength. She was one who would have countless people from grand clans and schools after her.

Yet, she was willing to marry the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster and remain in a mere subsidiary power. Anyone with half a brain would be able to tell that she had some sort of reason.

However, no one knew exactly what she was after. Furthermore, the more mysterious she was, the more unease Chu Feng felt. After all, what was most frightening was the unknown.

However, at the moment when Chu Feng was moving back to deliberately keep his distance from Bai Suyan, Bai Suyan unexpectedly smiled. Not only did she step forward and press her body closer to Chu Feng, she even extended her lily-white hand, grabbed Chu Feng’s chin and said with a smile on her face, “Chu Feng, while I can help you, you must know that there is no such thing as a free meal in this world. If you wish for my help, then you must also help me.”
