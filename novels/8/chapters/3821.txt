Chapter 3821 - Only One Person

That person appeared before Chu Feng and Li Xiao, blocking them. Not only were the bystanders surprised, but even Chu Feng was surprised.

Chu Feng did not know that person. Even if he were to reluctantly say that he knew that person, he was definitely not familiar with them.

The reason for that was because that person was also a person of the younger generation. It was Chu Feng’s first time meeting him.

When Chu Feng had first entered the palace, many of the younger generations had greeted him.

The majority of them only displayed a hypocritical show of affection and courtesy towards Chu Feng; putting on a show for Lord White Gown. That said, Chu Feng was also able to tell that there was someone that was really welcoming him.

As for that person, he was the person who stood between Chu Feng and Li Xiao.

That person appeared slightly aged. Although he was a person of the younger generation, he looked like a middle-aged man.

Chu Feng was able to tell that his actual age should be in the nineties. He would soon break away from the category of being a person of the younger generation.

Chu Feng also knew his name. Speaking of his name, it was quite a coincidence too. His name was Fan Chou. [1. Fan Chou means category.]

“Fan Chou, what are you doing?”

Li Xiao opened his eyes and shouted angrily upon seeing Fan Chou getting in his way.

“Alas, brother Li Xiao, we are all brothers of the same family, must you act this way?”

“Give me, Fan Chou, some face, and forget about this matter, okay?” Fan Chou said with a smile. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Give you face? Who the fuck do you think you are?”

As Li Xiao spoke, he pushed Fan Chou aside. His powerful strength pushed Fan Chou to the ground.

Li Xiao completely ignored the fallen Fan Chou. With big strides, he arrived before Chu Feng. He raised his fist with the intention of smashing it at his face.

However, at the instant Li Xiao raised his fist, he stood there stunned.

His gaze had met Chu Feng’s gaze.

He was standing right before Chu Feng. The distance between them was less than a foot. The two men’s eyes were fixed on one another. Li Xiao was able to see Chu Feng’s eyes clearly.

When Li Xiao saw Chu Feng’s gaze, not only did his body grow stiff, but his heart even started to shiver.

What he saw in Chu Feng’s gaze terrified him.

He felt as if he would be killed should he smash his fist at Chu Feng’s face.

Even though he didn’t understand why he felt that way, Li Xiao... was still afraid.

At that moment, cold sweat began to ooze from his forehead.

“Forget it. I will give Fan Chou face today.”

In a very unwilling manner, Li Xiao retrieved his fist.

Although Li Xiao knew why he was acting that way, the bystanders did not.

“What’s wrong? Do you know that fellow by the name of Fan Chou? Why are you giving him face?”

“That’s right. That Fan Chou only knows how to smile and chat with anyone he meets. He’s clearly just trash of low birth that wants to get close to us. There’s no need for you to give someone like that face, no?”

The crowd walked up to Li Xiao and began to question him.

After all, they’d all been hoping for Li Xiao to teach Chu Feng a lesson. They didn’t want him to let Chu Feng get away like that.

“Miss Yin, don’t move.”

Suddenly, a nervous voice was heard. It came from that man who had been examining their surroundings with Yin Zhaunghong.

Not only had he called out to Yin Zhuanghong, but he also arrived before her with the intention of stopping her.

It turned out that Yin Zhuanghong had arrived before a painting and pressed her hand onto an object in the painting.

However, even after that man spoke, Yin Zhuanghong did not stop her movements. She walked over to another painting and messed with that one too.

Originally, that man had wanted to stop Yin Zhuanghong. However, upon seeing that there was no abnormal change even after she had touched the second painting, he seemed to also realize something, and no longer tried to stop her.

As for Yin Zhuanghong, she began walking towards another painting. She began to pace back and forth between the three hundred plus paintings in the palace.

“What is Miss Yin doing?”

The people of the younger generation all felt very puzzled by Yin Zhuanghong’s behavior.

However, Chu Feng knew what she was doing very well.

The key to breaching the spirit formation of the palace hall was within the three hundred and eighteen paintings.

There was a mechanism in every painting. Those mechanisms must be pressed according to a special sequence. If one were to press them incorrectly, even if it was only a single one that was incorrect, the spirit formation would not be breached.

Instead, one might even encounter dangers.

That said, the paintings were very complicated. If one wanted to see through the spirit formation, one must carefully and patiently examine them. Even Chu Feng did not know the sequence to breaching the spirit formation.

However, Yin Zhuanghong had been there for an entire day.

Likely, she had already observed the paintings for an entire day. Since she had started the sequence mechanisms, it meant that she had most likely discovered the sequence to breaching the spirit formation.

“Buzz~~~”

When Yin Zhuanghong touched the final painting, the paintings all started emitting a dazzling light.

“Rumble~~~”

As the paintings emitted light, a rumble could be heard. The tightly closed gate of the palace actually opened.

“We actually needed to solve the mechanisms to leave this place?”

At that moment, the bewildered younger generations came to a sudden realization.

They’d also realized that they’d been mistaken.

The reason why the gate had stayed shut the entire time had nothing to do with Chu Feng. Instead, they had needed to solve the spirit formation in order to leave.

If they’d waited in the palace without doing anything, they might not be able to leave their for entire life.

It turned out that the test had begun the moment they entered the palace hall.

They’d also finally realized why Yin Zhuanghong and that man had been examining the walls and paintings the entire time. They had already discovered the secret to exiting the palace hall.

Because of that, the crowd began to look to Yin Zhuanghong and that man with admiration in their eyes.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the light emitted from the paintings gathered together and formed several large characters.

Seeing those large characters, the pupils of the younger generations all shrunk. Following that, their expressions all became ugly.

The reason for that was because those characters wrote...

Only a single person will be able to meet Yuan Shu!!!
