Chapter 3182 - Unexpected Encirclement

“What’s going on?”

“Could it be something my mother did?”

“But... why would my mother do that?”

“Why would she seal away the world spirits that want to enter a contract with me of their own accord through the use of a spirit formation?”

“Could it be that mother knew that those world spirits have impure goals, and will bring harm to me?”

Chu Feng began to contemplate. If it was some sort of spirit formation placed on his body, it would most likely be something done by his mother.

However, Chu Feng didn’t understand why his mother would do such a thing.

“Aiyoh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s body leaned to the side. Chu Feng actually fell to the ground.

Chu Feng opened his eyes to look, and discovered that he had already left the spirit formation space. Bai Liluo was standing beside him and looking at him.

It would appear that it was Bai Liluo who had forcibly brought Chu Feng back from the world spirit space.

“You’ve succeeded, right?” Bai Liluo asked Chu Feng.

“Let me try again,” Chu Feng immediately got up. With a thought, golden light began to cover his surroundings.

Spirit energy was being emitted from Chu Feng’s body.

The golden spirit power was very bright and dazzling. When compared to Chu Feng’s spirit power from the past, it was even stronger. The reason why it was stronger was because of the veined patterns of Chu Feng’s spirit power.

Those veined patterns resembled snakes. Chu Feng’s spirit power had reached the level of Snake Mark Exalted-cloak.

Chu Feng had become a Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

“It would appear that I’ve succeeded,” Chu feng said with a smile.

“Not bad, little brother Chu Feng. The speed at which you refined those world spirits’ profoundness is even faster than your big sister had anticipated.”

“However, since you’ve already refined them, why did you continue to stay inside instead of coming out directly?” Bai Liluo asked.

“It’s nothing,” Chu Feng smiled. Even though he trusted Bai Liluo greatly, his trust toward her was not at a level where he would tell her everything.

Soon, Chu Feng’s expression changed. He noticed that Bai Liluo’s little face was actually different.

Bai Liluo had very fair and white skin. However, at that moment, she was abnormally white. To be exact, she was deathly pale.

Not only was she deathly pale, but there was also cold sweat on her face. In fact, her body was trembling slightly, and even her voice had become weak.

In fact, even the white light emitted by her body had grown much dimmer, and was no longer as brilliant as before.

“Girl, did this happen because you were helping me activate that spirit formation...”

Chu Feng was felt distressed and ashamed. He knew that Bai Liluo’s current state must be because she had exhausted too much of her strength in activating and maintaining that spirit formation.

“It’s nothing serious. These are all minor problems. I will recover after some time. However, if you had failed to make a breakthrough in your world spirit techniques, you would likely not have been able to help me.”

“Fortunately, you didn’t disappoint me.”

After saying those words, Bai Liluo sat down cross-legged on the ground.

Her breathing started to fluctuate up and down. She had started doing a special breathing exercise.

As she continued with her exercise, her poor health started to gradually get better.

Bai Liluo was recovering.

However, the speed of her recovery was very slow. Bai Liluo finally opened her eyes after twenty whole hours passed.

Her body was no longer shivering. Even her facial complexion had gotten much better. However, Bai Liluo actually was not fully recovered yet.

“Well then, let’s go. Next, you must make sure to properly help big sister,” Bai Liluo acted as if she had fully recovered, and spoke to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.

Seeing Bai Liluo revealing such a look, Chu Feng decided to keep quiet. He knew that she must want to get the thing she wanted very urgently. That was the reason why she would be so impatient to set off.

Afterwards, Chu Feng and Bai Liluo returned in the same direction they came from.

Enroute, Chu Feng said to Bai Liluo, “Little girl, I have a question that I wish to ask you. I wonder if you might be able to answer my question. If it’s unsuitable, you can pretend that I never mentioned it.”

“What question is it? Tell me first,” Bai Liluo said.

“Little girl, exactly where are you from?” Chu Feng asked.

“Aiyoh, boy, you’re not being good here. Why would you ask about my private business?”

“That said, it’s not like I can’t tell you about it either. Big sister will tell you the answer to that question of yours in the future. Is that fine with you?” Bai Liluo said to Chu Feng.

“Very well,” hearing that response, Chu Feng smiled and nodded.

For a question like that, if the person being asked the question didn’t wish to tell him, it would serve no purpose no matter how many times Chu Feng asked.

However, Chu Feng felt that the little girl would one day be willing to tell him the truth.

On the way back, Bai Liluo’s speed was still very slow.

Chu Feng felt that there must be a reason as to why Bai Liluo was doing this. Thus, he did not ask too much about it.

After a long journey, Chu Feng and Bai Liluo finally returned to the mountain peak covered in ice and snow.

“Miss Liluo, you’ve finally come out. We have waited bitterly for you,” right after Chu Feng and Bai Liluo returned to the mountain peak, a voice was heard.

At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that their surroundings were covered with Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen.

Qingyu Fengming, Qingyu Yunlong and Qingyu Yunhu were all present.

Furthermore, there was an individual in the group that was even stronger than Qingyu Yunlong and Qingyu Yunhu.

The person that had spoken earlier was precisely that person.

That person was naturally none other than the leader of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, Qingyu Ruize.

Upon seeing Qingyu Ruize and the others, Bai Liluo frowned slightly. She asked, “How did you all know that I was here?”

“You don’t have to concern yourself with that. You merely need to give us an explanation,” Qingyu Ruize said.

“Explanation? What explanation?” Bai Liluo asked.

“Miss Liluo, as a guest elder of our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, you decided to attack and torture our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s subsidiary power and berate our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen before all those people. Furthermore, you decided to aid our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan’s enemy.”

“If you don’t provide me with an satisfactory explanation, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to properly account for my brothers,” Qingyu Ruize said.

“And what if I refuse to provide an explanation?” Bai Liluo asked.

“In that case, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to allow you to leave here in peace,” Qingyu Ruize said.

Hearing those words, the corners of Bai Liluo’s mouth lifted into a cold smile. Then, she said to Qingyu Ruize, “Qingyu Ruize, say what you just said one more time.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Bai Liluo, don’t you act so arrogant. I know that you possess some ability. However, our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan is absolutely not...”

“Woosh~~~”

Before Qingyu Ruize could finish his words, Bai Liluo waved her sleeve.

Immediately, a strong gale swept forth and brought forth massive snow that covered the sky.

The white snowflakes were so thick that not even Chu Feng could see past them.

Fortunately, the fierce gale and the flying snow only lasted for a split second before gradually dissipating.

When the strange snow dissipated, the region was still covered in swirling snow.

Merely, the snowflakes now were ordinary. As for the violent gale and intense snow earlier, they were created by an ability.

At that moment, even Chu Feng’s expression changed.

Chu Feng was able to tell that Qingyu Ruize was stronger than Qingyu Yunlong and Qingyu Yunhu.

He was very likely a rank two Martial Immortal.

However, at that moment, including Qingyu Ruize, everyone from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan were frozen in a thick layer of ice.

It was as if they had been sealed, and were unable to move in the slightest.
