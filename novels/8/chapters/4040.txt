Chapter 4040 - Contempt And Humiliation

“Wasn’t it rumored that the Wuming Clan had suffered a disastrous loss in their battle against the Linghu Heavenly Clan, and only a small portion of their experts had managed to flee?”

“Then why are the war chariots of the Six Great Utmost Exalteds and the Ten Great Experts, the strongest experts of the Wuming Clan, all here?”

“Could they really have come out unscathed in their battle against the Linghu Heavenly Clan?”

“If their war chariot is here, it means that they’re also here. If they were dead, their war chariots wouldn’t be here. They are most definitely alive.”

“It would appear that the rumors are unreliable. Although the Wuming Clan was defeated by the Linghu Heavenly Clan, they’ve not suffered many losses at all. They’ve escaped unscathed.”

“Good. This is a good thing.”

“The Wuming Clan was not weakened. This is most definitely a good thing for our Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

The crowd started discussing spiritedly upon seeing the numerous experts of the Wuming Clan.

However, perhaps because they were afraid of offending the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Wuming Clan, the great majority of people were whispering or discussing through voice transmission.

Suddenly, the whispering crowd burst into an uproar.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng and the other experts of the Chu Heavenly Clan had all arrived.

Upon seeing the arrival of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, the crowd knew that a show was about to begin.

“Clan Chief Chu, you’re truly someone to put on airs, you’ve actually made this old man wait so long.”

Upon seeing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, an old man walked out from one of the Wuming Clan’s war chariots.

That was not an ordinary war chariot.

The war chariot was located at the front of the Wuming Clan’s army.

Not only was the war chariot exquisitely built and a treasure in itself, it also flew another banner apart from the Wuming Clan’s banner.

On the banner were the words ‘Utmost Exalted.’

Once that person walked out of the war chariot, the vast crowd once again burst into an uproar.

The old man that appeared had a head of white hair and a fierce-looking appearance. One could tell from a glance that he was not an amiable person.

That old man was not an ordinary individual.

His name was Wuming Fenghong.

He was one of the Wuming Clan’s Six Great Utmost Exalted.

He was a rank one Utmost Exalted-level expert.

In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he was one of the most powerful and grand existences.

In fact, for many people, he was a legend that they’d only heard of, and had never seen.

As such, it was only natural for the crowd to be excited, as they were able to see him in the flesh.

“My sincere apologies. This old man didn’t know that the Wuming Clan had arrived. Please excuse me for not coming out to meet you all sooner.”

“Milords, please come inside.”

Although the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he did not put on any airs of arrogance against the former ruler at all. Instead, he was very courteous.

In the eyes of others, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s courtesy created a totally different impression.

They didn’t think that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was being courteous. Rather, they felt that he was scared of the Wuming Clan.

“There’s no need to go in. You’re also an intelligent man; you should know the purpose of our coming here.”

Wuming Fenghong spoke with arrogance. He had not even bothered to look the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief in the face the entire time. His behavior fully revealed his contempt for the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Milord, if there’s something you need, it wouldn’t hurt to say it directly,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Trying to play stupid?”

“That’s fine, I’ll make things clear for you.”

“The overlord status of various starfields has always been one upheld by those who are capable.”

“Ask yourself this: is your Chu Heavenly Clan qualified to be the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord?”

“As for you, are you qualified to be the ruler of this Ancestral Martial Starfield?”

“You, are you the strongest expert in this Ancestral Martial Starfield?”

Wuming Fenghong spoke with a stern and thunderous voice.

His speech was mainly a mockery of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I am ashamed. This old man is indeed not the strongest expert of this Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Normally, our Chu Heavenly Clan would indeed not be qualified to be this Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“It would appear that you’re not stupid.”

“You didn’t become overly arrogant after gaining possession of glory that did not belong to you.”

“Since that’s the case, things are much simpler.”

“From today on, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord status will no longer belong to your Chu Heavenly Clan. Instead, it will belong to our Wuming Clan.”

“Seeing that your attitude has been good, we will not look into your Chu Heavenly Clan’s crime of taking possession of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord status without permission.”

“However, you need to know who the actual ruler of this Ancestral Martial Starfield is.”

“From today on, it’d be best for you to carry yourselves with your tails between your legs. If you dare to have any rebellious thoughts again, you’ll have to suffer the consequences.”

Wuming Fenghong’s voice was extremely resounding.

His speech was not meant for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Rather, it was meant for the others present. He wanted to let all of them know that their Wuming Clan had returned, and that they would continue to be the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord.

All powers, including the Chu Heavenly Clan, would have to submit to their Wuming Clan.

Otherwise, they would suffer the extermination of their entire clan.

After saying those words, Wuming Fenghong turned around and intended to return to his war chariot.

“Wait.”

However, right at that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly spoke.

“This old man does not have any complaint with the Wuming Clan’s intention to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord.”

“However, this old man cannot be the one to decide on this matter. You all will have to seek out and consult the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Divine Body Royal City and Monstrous Beast Sacred City.”

Hearing those words, Wuming Fenghong immediately turned around, “What are you implying with that?”

“Back then, this old man never wanted to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord.”

“It is the masters of the Three Cities that insisted on having this old man agree to it.”

“Since I’ve agreed to the status, this old man will have to uphold my responsibility to it.”

“At the very least, this old man cannot abdicate the position at will. If I did, I would’ve let down the task entrusted to me by the masters of the Three Cities.”

“Thus, if the Three Cities demand that I step down as the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord, this old man will abdicate without any opposition.”

“But, if the demand is not from the Three Cities, then no one else will have the qualification to deprive this old man of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord status.”

“Regardless of whether or not this old man is qualified for this status, I will still not hand it over to anyone else.”

The words spoken by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief brought a look of shock to everyone’s eyes.

Many people even opened their mouths in disbelief.

They had truly never anticipated that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would dare to refuse the Wuming Clan’s coercion, and say such things on top of that.

“Clan Chief Chu, you truly have quite some nerve. You dare to use the Three Cities to pressure me?”

Sure enough, Wuming Fenghong’s gaze turned gloomy and cold.

“That is not this old man’s intention at all. It’s just that this old man’s position was given to me by the Three Cities’ masters. If anyone wants to strip me of my position, only the masters of the Three Cities are be able to do so,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Motherfucker! You damned old bastard dare to wave a chicken feather as a token of authority?! You’re truly one to refuse the face that is given to you!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Instead of listening to me when I’m speaking to you properly, you insist on having me wipe out your Chu Heavenly Clan?”

Wuming Fenghong was throughtly enraged. As he spoke, he released his overwhelming oppressive might.

“Boom~~~”

His oppressive might wreaked havoc in the surroundings.

When his oppressive might appeared, the surroundings seemed to have turned into a boundless hell.

Wuming Fenghong was the master of that hell. Anyone he wanted to keep alive would live, and anyone he wanted to kill would die.

This was the sort of oppression Utmost Exalted-level experts brought to those with cultivations below them.

Sensing the oppressive might, many of the people present were completely terrified. It was even more so for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.
