Chapter 3551 - Precisely Going To Humiliate You All

“Yunfei, you should rejoice at the fact that you did not leave too deep of a conflict with young friend Chu Feng. Otherwise... the consequences would be unthinkable, simply unthinkable.”

Elder Xing Yi patted Song Yunfei’s shoulder. Then, he crushed the Starfall Holy Stone fragment he held in his hand and was teleported outside.

“Elder Xing Er, what did Elder Xing Yi mean by what he just said?” Song Yunfei looked to Elder Xing Er. He had a very bad feeling, and urgently wanted to obtain an answer.

“Yunfei, you are a smart person yourself, shouldn’t you be able to tell that young friend Chu Feng’s current strength surpasses even our Lord Holy Master?” Elder Xing Er asked.

“Boom~~~”

It was like an explosion of ten thousand thunders!!!

This news brought enormous shock to Song Yunfei.

He took several steps back, and was unable to even stand firm. Had it not been for the fact that there were other people behind him that supported him, he would’ve likely fallen to the ground.

“Senior brother, are you alright?”

The crowd looked to Song Yunfei with worry as they supported him.

However, Song Yunfei did not answer them. Instead, he turned his gaze to Xia Yun’er, who was nearby.

Xia Yun’er also had a shocked expression on her beautiful face. Complicated feelings could be seen in her beautiful eyes as she stared at Chu Feng, who was outside.

Seeing Xia Yun’er like that, Song Yunfei turned his gaze to Chu Feng.

Upon doing so, he saw that the experts of their Starfall Holy Land, including their Holy Master, were still tied up.

As for the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, they were all lying on the ground.

Only Chu Feng was standing in midair.

It was as if both the righteous and the evil were defeated, and only he was victorious.

At that moment, Song Yunfei felt completely dejected.

How was he supposed to contend against an opponent like Chu Feng?

“Young master Chu Feng, do you know why these ropes cannot be untied?”

It was not only Elder Xing Yi who came out of the Starfall Holy Stone; the others also came out in succession. They wanted to untie their Holy Master. Yet, they discovered that they were simply too weak, and unable to untie the ropes at all.

However, they knew that Chu Feng would definitely be able to untie the ropes. That was why they deliberately asked him that question. They were asking for his help.

“Seniors, do not worry.”

“As the saying goes, whoever hung the bell on the tiger’s neck must untie it. We cannot untie those ropes ourselves,” as Chu Feng spoke, he turned his gaze to the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen lying on the ground.

The person who seemed to be the leader of the group of Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen raised his head to ask, “What are you implying? Are you trying to have us personally untie the ropes? You’re trying to seize this opportunity to humiliate us?”

“That’s right, that is precisely my intention,” Chu Feng nodded.

“You!!!”

The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were furious, and the bystanders were completely astonished.

Even if one was trying to humiliate others, one should not be so confident and self-righteous, no?

“You’re trying to humiliate us like that? You’re simply looking down on our Blood-devouring Demon Clan too much. As the saying goes, a warrior can be killed, but not humiliated. In the dictionary of our Blood-devouring Demon Clan, the word ‘surrender’ does not exist!”

“Today, all of you shall die!”

After saying those words, crimson radiance began to shine from the black cloaks of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

Seeing that, many people cried out. They knew that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were trying to self-detonate.

It was not only a single person. Instead, all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen present were emitting that sort of strange crimson radiance from their black cloaks. All of them were planning to self-detonate.

However, when everyone was thinking that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen would explode, the crimson lights suddenly started to wane.

Then, everything returned to normal. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At that moment, no one said anything. However, they were wondering if the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were deliberately scaring them. They were thinking that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen simply had no intention of self-detonating at all.

However, to the crowd’s surprise, the black cloaks of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen soon started to shine with crimson radiance again.

However, the crimson radiance soon waned again.

This repeated several times. The people from the Starfall Holy Land were all puzzled. They did not understand exactly what the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were trying to do.

“Why would it be like this?!!!” Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was from a Blood-devouring Demon Clansman.

The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen knew very well that they were not trying to scare people by pretending to self-detonate. Instead, they really wanted to self-detonate.

That was the rule of their Blood-devouring Demon Clan. Should one shoulder a heavy responsibility, then there would only exist two options for one to take. Either one would accomplish one’s mission, or one must commit suicide through self-detonation.

However, they had attempted to self-detonate multiple times. Yet, all of them ended up in failure. It was as if the mysterious technique that they’d trained in was ineffective, and they were unable to use it to activate the power of self-detonation.

“What’s wrong? Are you all trying to self-detonate to take us down with you?”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s voice was suddenly heard.

Not only was Chu Feng’s tone filled with mocking intent, but he also had a very obvious mocking expression on his face.

“Bastard! It’s you?! You’re the one who did this?!”

“Impossible! This is impossible! You couldn’t possibly be able to do that!”

At the beginning, the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen suspected that it might be caused by Chu Feng. However, this thought was immediately rejected.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, right at that moment, an Exalted-level expert from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan started to scream miserably whilst rolling and crawling on the ground. He was struggling with enormous pain.

“I’ll give you two choices. You will either personally untie the ropes, or you will be, like him, tortured to death by me,” Chu Feng looked to the Blood-devouring Demon Clansman who was screaming miserably.

“It really is you?” Seeing that scene, the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen had no choice but to believe it.

It was not only the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen that were surprised. Even the Starfall Holy Land’s experts opened their eyes wide with shock.

Could it be that Chu Feng had really sealed away the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen’s ability to self-detonate?

The crowd felt that to be simply unimaginable. Yet, it seemed like Chu Feng had managed to accomplish precisely that.

Actually, that was not hard at all for Chu Feng. After all, he was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. When his cultivation surpassed all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, using his world spirit techniques to seal away their mysterious technique was simply too simple.

This was especially true because he had already experienced the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen killing themselves when they found themselves in a dire situation. Thus, he was prepared for them to do so again.

His world spirit techniques were used so skillfully that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen did not even know that their mysterious techniques were already sealed.

“I’ll untie it, I’ll go and untie them. Please stop, please stop!”

After being tortured by Chu Feng, that Blood-devouring Demon Clansman was finally unable to endure it anymore. He actually began to beg Chu Feng for forgiveness.

“What did you say?! How could you reach terms with scum like that?!”

The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were all furious. They all started lashing out at that Blood-devouring Demon Clansman.

However, that Blood-devouring Demon Clansman ignored his clansmen’s criticisms. He stood up and started walking over to untie the ropes on the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master and other experts.

This sort of behavior was something that Chu Feng had expected.

These Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were all very unyielding. That was something that could be seen by how they were willing to kill themselves through self-detonation without any hesitation.

That said, a death through self-detonation would be an easy death, a painless death.

However, the torture from Chu Feng was something that ordinary people would simply find very difficult to endure.

After all, torture was sometimes more terrifying than death itself. Torture would not only cause one to fall apart, but it would also drive one insane.

Because of that, whilst the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen did not fear death, they might not necessarily be able to withstand being tortured by Chu Feng.
