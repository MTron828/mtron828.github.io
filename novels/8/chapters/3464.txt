Chapter 3464 - Whose Name?

“Look, the lords from the Starfield Master Realm have arrived!!!”

Right at that moment, many excited shouts sounded from outside.

Looking out, one could see over a hundred war chariots flying orderly through the air.

Not only were the war chariots very imposing, one would also feel reverence upon seeing those stunning banners.

In fact, when those war chariots appeared, the surroundings that were filled with noise immediately quietened down significantly.

As for the reason for the changefor , it was all because of the words on the banners: Starfield Master Realm!!!

“The people from the Starfield Master Realm actually arrived ahead of time?”

Many Tantai Heavenly Clansmen revealed shocked expressions.

“It is not that our Starfield Master Realm arrived ahead of time, but rather that the Linghu Heavenly Clan is arriving late,” said Wuming Xingyun. He had a very stern expression as he said those words. An expression of displeasure was present in his eyes.

Seeing Wuming Xingyun like that, many people on the warship immediately shut their mouths.

They actually already knew about the dispute between the Linghu Heavenly Clan and the Starfield Master Realm. The two of them were destined to battle one another for the position of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord.

Merely, when that day finally arrived, everyone would feel fear. No one knew whether the future battle for the position of overlord would implicate them or not.

At that moment, the Linghu Heavenly Clan still had not shown up after a long time. This was clearly a declaration of war against the Starfield Master Realm.

Based on the way the Starfield Master Realm did things they would definitely not allow such a thing to happen.

As such, the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen were extremely afraid. They feared that the Starfield Master Realm and the Linghu Heavenly Clan would go to war right at that moment.

If those two huge monsters were to battle, countless people would be implicated.

Because of that, the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen all became nervous.

“Look! The people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan have also arrived!”

Right at that moment, another cry of surprise was heard.

Looking toward the source of the voice, ten war chariots had appeared in the close distance.

Those were indeed people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Although the ten war chariots appeared to be much more imposing than the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s three warships, they were much less imposing than the Starfield Master Realm’s over a hundred war chariots.

“Senior, could it be a misunderstanding? Judging from the way the Linghu Heavenly Clan looks today, they should not be deliberately trying to offend your Starfield Master Realm. Perhaps some sort of problem occurred on their way over, and caused them to arrive late?” Tantai Xing’er said.

“Perhaps,” Wuming Xingyun replied.

Upon seeing that the Linghu Heavenly Clan only arrived with ten war chariots, the anger in Wuming Xingyun’s eyes decreased greatly.

If the Linghu Heavenly Clan also arrived with over a hundred war chariots, it would truly be a declaration of war against the Starfield Master Realm.

However, with only ten war chariots, their imposing might was much weaker than that of the Starfield Master Realm’s. As such, it could not be seen as a sign of provocation.

Furthermore, the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s war chariots were extremely fast, and arrived at the important guest region before the Starfield Master Realm’s war chariots. Furthermore, they left the central region of the important guest region, the largest region, empty.

Their behavior revealed that the Linghu Heavenly Clan did not plan to declare war against the Starfield Master Realm. At the very least... they were not planning to declare war just yet.

Upon noticing all that, many people who knew about the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s ambition heaved a sigh of relief.

After all, they were all there to enjoy the competition between the geniuses of the younger generation.

No one wished for the Starfield Master Realm and the Linghu Heavenly Clan to wage war at a such a time.

“Look, the lords from the Starfield Master Realm have come out! They’re proceeding towards the Apex Pillars!”

“They’re going to change the names on the Apex Pillars.”

Soon, the crowd burst into another uproar. This time around, they were even more excited.

Earlier, a group of people had flown out of the Starfield Master Realm’s war chariots. The person leading that group was carrying an enormous, thousand meter-long writing brush.

That was the writing brush used to alter the names on the Apex Pillars.

“What are they doing?” Chu Feng asked.

Hearing his question, Tantai Xing’er hurriedly explained it to him.

It was only after hearing Tantai Xing’er’s explanation that Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie learned about the Apex Pillars.

At that moment, the two of them were also looking at the Apex Pillars with interest. They wanted to know whose names would be on them after being altered.

After all, to have one’s name inscribed directly onto an Apex Pillar was quite an honor.

Finally, the old man holding the enormous writing brush arrived before the Apex Pillar inscribed with Li Anzhi’s name.

“Woosh~~~”

He waved the enormous writing brush. Immediately, light emerged. Following that, Li Anzhi’s name disappeared from the Apex Pillar.

Then, the old man began to rapidly move the enormous writing brush back and forth. Soon, four characters were inscribed onto the Apex Pillar. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Many people revealed astonished expressions upon seeing those four characters. Some felt disappointed, and some were unable to accept it. Some sighed, and some felt delighted.

However, the person feeling the most complicated would be none other than Wuma Shengjie.

The reason for that was because the four giant characters inscribed onto that Apex Pillar were Wuma Shengjie’s name.

“It’s me?”

The cold and detached Wuma Shengjie’s eyes wide actually opened wide. Surprise had covered her face.

“Young friend Wuma Shengjie, you are qualified to take on this honor,” Wuming Xingyun patted Wuma Shengjie’s shoulder.

“Right, what Lord Wuming Xingyun says is correct. Qualified, our Shengjie should be qualified to take on this honor,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief felt extremely excited. He was so excited that his eyes had grown moist.

After all, to their Wuma Heavenly Clan, this was a matter that brought honor to their ancestors.

Whilst he would not be able to represent their main clan and surpass the branch clan in his lifetime, he saw hope in Wuma Shengjie.

“Look, that lord is going to alter the name on the Apex Pillar with Linghu Hongfei’s name,” Suddenly, the vast sea of people became excited again.

Compared to the Apex Pillar inscribed with Li Anzhi’s name, the Apex Pillar inscribed with Linghu Hongfei’s name was even more important.

Everyone wanted to know... who exactly, was capable of replacing Linghu Hongfei and having their name inscribed onto the first ranked Apex Pillar!!!
