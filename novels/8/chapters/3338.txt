Chapter 3338 - Foolish Scheme

“Two Supreme Elders, what might it be for the two of you to gather us here?” Someone stepped forward and asked.

“Everyone, I want to remind you all that all of us here had contributed greatly to the fall of Chu Xuanyuan and his son Chu Feng back then.”

“And now, Chu Feng has returned to our Chu Heavenly Clan, and even obtained great favor from the clan chief. If this is to continue, it will not be long before Chu Xuanyuan returns.”

“With Chu Xuanyuan’s character, I believe there isn’t a need for me to explain to you all what we will be confronted with then,” Chu Hanqing said.

After Chu Hanqing finished saying those words, the crowd’s expressions turned frenetic.

One by one, they began to speak, “Lord Supreme Elder, that is actually what we were worried about the entire time. Merely, Lord Clan Chief has pampered Chu Feng excessively, and even given him the Death Exemption Title Plate.”

“Under such circumstances, not to mention attacking that Chu Feng, we simply cannot afford to even offend him. Lord Supreme Elder, please enlighten us as to exactly what we should do,” the crowd all kneeled on the ground and sought help from Chu Hanqing.

It could be seen that what Chu Hanqing brought up was actually what they were worried about the entire time. All of them greatly feared Chu Feng’s rise in power. At that time, as Chu Feng’s enemies, they would definitely suffer greatly.

“Little sister Youyou, it’s your turn now,” Chu Hanqing turned his gaze to Chu Hanyouyou.

“I’ve said it many times already, call me Elder You, not little sister,” Chu Hanyouyou glared at Chu Hanqing. It would appear that she wasn’t extremely fond of the way Chu Hanqing addressed her.

“Very well, Elder You. Everyone is very worried, we shouldn’t beat about the bush anymore. You should directly tell them your plan,” Chu Hanqing said.

“With the situation at hand now, there’s only one way to take care of Chu Feng. That is, we will have to rupture the relationship between Chu Feng and Lord Clan Chief. At that time, we will naturally be able to take care of Chu Feng.”

“Actually, that so-called Death Exemption Title Plate is nothing more than Lord Clan Chief’s personal decision. If he wanted Chu Feng to be alive, Chu Feng would be able to live. If he wanted Chu Feng to die, Chu Feng has no choice but to die,” Chu Hanyouyou said.

“Lady Supreme Elder, what you’ve said is very true. Merely, Lord Clan Chief.... is truly fond of Chu Feng. No one would even dare to say anything bad about Chu Feng before Lord Clan Chief. Thus, how exactly are we supposed to foil their relationship?” The crowd asked.

“I have a plan. Before everyone’s eyes, we will have Chu Feng offer Lord Clan Chief a cup of poison. We will have everyone personally witness Chu Feng’s intention to poison Lord Clan Chief,” Chu Hanyouyou said.

“Lady Supreme Elder, could it be that you... want to kill Lord Clan Chief with poison?”

The crowd all revealed lingering fear upon hearing Chu Hanyouyou’s plan.

Although they were very displeased by how much the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief pampered Chu Feng, they did not dare to actually cause the death of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

They knew very well that, in their current Chu Heavenly Clan, only the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was the true pillar of support. If something were to happen to him, their Chu Heavenly Clan would definitely fall and they too would also be despised by others.

This was especially true now, during the crucial moment when an Upper Realm Gate had opened in their Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. None of them wished to lose their Clan Chief.

It was not that they had deep affection for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. It was merely that they still needed his protection.

“Lady Supreme Elder, I know that as long as Lord Clan Chief remains alive, we will not be able to completely eliminate Chu Xuanyuan and Chu Feng, those two thorns.”

“But, even if we’re to plan to kill Lord Clan Chief, we shouldn’t be doing it now. It’s still not the right time for this.”

Sure enough, someone attempted to dissuade this thought.

Furthermore, that person spoke very clearly. He was saying that their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief could be killed, but could not be killed just yet.

“Who said that I want to kill the clan chief with poison?”

“The poison will only cause him to lose consciousness. At the very most, it will make him appear to be dying, but it will not actually endanger his life.”

“What we need to do is merely let everyone witness Chu Feng’s intention to kill the clan chief. After the clan chief goes into a coma, we’ll be able to openly take care of Chu Feng,” Chu Hanyouyou said.

“That’s a great idea. But, Lady Supreme Elder, I fear that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to be willing to poison Lord Clan Chief,” the crowd said.

The crowd were only saying that Chu Hanyouyou’s scheme was a great idea. In their hearts, they were cursing Chu Hanyouyou for being retarded.

Chu Feng was already hostile toward them. How could he possibly listen to them and poison the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, who pampered him to such a great extent?

That was simply akin to a pipe dream.

No, such a thing would not happen even in a dream, much less in actuality.

“Fools. Chu Feng would naturally not be willing to do such a thing. But... we can find someone to disguise as Chu Feng,” Chu Hanyouyou said.

“Find someone to disguise as Chu Feng?”

“Who could possibly escape Lord Clan Chief’s detection?”

“That’s right. That’s simply too difficult. Unless that person were a Saint-cloak World Spiritist or had a much stronger cultivation than Lord Clan Chief’s... it is simply impossible.”

The crowd shook their heads again. They felt that Chu Hanyouyou’s plan was not feasible.

It wasn’t that there wasn’t anyone capable of disguising themselves as Chu Feng.

With how vast the Ancestral Martial Starfield was, there were countless talents. To find someone capable of disguising themselves as Chu Feng and escaping the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s detection was naturally possible.

The issue was that they would not be able to move a person capable of that feat. In fact, they would not dare to request the assistance of that sort of individual either.

Faced with the crowd’s expressions that stated that her plan was unfeasible, Chu Hanyouyou laughed coldly. Then, she said, “Everyone, have a look. What do you all think of this person?”

“Paa~~~”

After she finished saying those words, Chu Hanyouyou snapped her finger.

Then, a figure walked out from the barrier behind Chu Hanyouyou and Chu Hanqing.

“This...” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Seeing that person, the eyes of everyone present brightened. They were all pleasantly surprised.
