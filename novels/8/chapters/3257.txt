Chapter 3257 - The God Of The Cultivation Realm

While Wuma Shengjie was treating his injuries, the people from the Wuma Heavenly Clan all continued with their training.

After roughly four hours passed, all of them opened their eyes.

“The natural energies have completely disappeared,” The Wuma Heavenly Clansmen lamented with intense helplessness.

They were very small and insignificant in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. For many things, they could only allow nature to take its course.

Not even Wuma Shengjie had the capability to stop it. As for them, it was even more out of the question.

Not long after they opened their eyes, a destructive aura suddenly enveloped them. That aura caused their hair to stand on end, and their hearts to tremble violently.

However, that sort of sensation only lasted for an instant. This caused them to become uncertain as to whether or not that aura was real, or if they were misperceiving things.

“What’s going on?” That frightening sensation that only lasted for an instant caused the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen to think that they’d experienced some sort of illusion.

“You all also felt it?”

Soon, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen discovered from the expressions of their fellow clansmen that they were not the only ones that felt that destructive aura. It seemed that all of their clansmen present had felt it.

“I thought it to be my imagination. Could it be that it wasn’t a hallucination? You all also felt it?”

“I seem to have heard thunder earlier too.”

The Wuma Heavenly Clansmen began to spiritedly discuss the sensation they’d felt.

They all felt that the strange phenomenon and that unassessable aura that they felt earlier was not a hallucination. They felt that it was very possible for it to be an omen, a very bad omen.

In panic, someone suggested, “It would appear that something has truly occurred. We cannot continue to stay here.”

“No, Shengjie is still suppressing the Bloodsoul Gu. We cannot disturb him at this time. Otherwise, we will cause him to suffer a backlash.”

“It’s better that we wait for Shengjie to finish suppressing the Bloodsoul Gu before leaving this place.”

“Mn, it would appear that we can only do that.”

At that moment, the people from the Wuma Heavenly Clan turned their eyes to the palace where Wuma Shengjie was as anxiety filled their eyes.

It could be seen that the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen wanted to quickly leave that place. However, upon considering Wuma Shengjie’s safety, they decided to stay and wait for him.

Not long afterward, the sensation from earlier was felt once more. Merely, the aura this time around was even more frightening. At the same time, the speed at which it disappeared was even faster.

At that moment, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen started to panic even more. However, they still managed to calm themselves, and did not disturb Wuma Shengjie.

However, a short moment after that, the frightening sensation was felt once more. Furthermore, the aura this time was even more frightening, and the speed at which it disappeared was again even faster.

This caused the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen to feel even more certain that it was a sign of impending danger.

With this, they started to totally panic. Many Wuma Heavenly Clansmen started to waver, and wanted to leave.

However, taking into consideration the grace that Wuma Shengjie had shown them, they ultimately decided to stay, and also did not go to bother Wuma Shengjie.

Fortunately, after that sort of frightening aura appeared three times, it no longer appeared again.

This slightly alleviated the panic of the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen.

That said, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen had no idea that the frightening auras that they felt were simply not an omen of danger at all.

Instead, it was the passing of the Divine Tribulation’s lightning. The Divine Tribulation’s lightning had swept by them three times. Merely, the speed of the lightning was so fast that they were unable to see them. That was the reason why they were only able to feel the frightening aura and hear a flash of thunder.

As for that Divine Tribulation’s lightning, it was naturally caused by Chu Feng.

After Chu Feng finished refining the cultivation resource, he immediately began attempting to making a breakthrough.

With the Divine Tribulation’s lightning passing by three times, it signified that Chu Feng had managed to make three consecutive breakthroughs in his cultivation.

At that moment, Chu Feng sat cross-legged deep below the cave, as his eyes opened.

Chu Feng’s aura was no longer that of a rank two Martial Immortal. Instead, it had increased to that of a rank five Martial Immortal.

Chu Feng’s three consecutive breakthroughs had allowed him to become an actual rank five Martial Immortal.

“The gift my grandfather left me is truly amazing.”

Chu Feng stood up and looked at his body, and a smile filled his face.

The reason why Chu Feng felt so joyous was not just because he had managed to make three consecutive breakthroughs to become a rank five Martial Immortal.

There was another reason for his happiness. That was that his body had changed.

If one were to pay close attention, one would notice that Chu Feng was emitting a multi-colored radiance.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had grasped a great power. It was the power of the spirit formation.

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to sense everything regarding the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

The various spirit formations, the auras of the cultivators and the cultivation resources of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm were all within Chu Feng’s grasp.

Most importantly, Chu Feng had gained the power of instant teleportation. Should he wish it, he would be able to instantly appear anywhere he wanted to be.

To put it simply, the current Chu Feng was simply a god in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Chu Feng controlled everything regarding the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

The reason for this enormous change was naturally because of that cultivation resource, that gift from Chu Feng’s grandfather.

Chu Feng had not only gained natural energies and martial comprehension that allowed his cultivation to increase greatly, but he had also assimilated with the cultivation resource.

As for that cultivation resource, it was actually the formation core of an enormously powerful spirit formation in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

That spirit formation practically linked the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. That was how Chu Feng had gained his god-like abilities.

“Strange, why can’t I feel that girl’s aura?”

“It would appear that that girl is even more extraordinary than I had imagined her to be. I am able to sense everything else, but she’s the only exception,” Chu Feng gasped with admiration.

The girl Chu Feng spoke of was naturally Bai Liluo.

Chu Feng was able to sense everyone’s auras with the exception of Bai Liluo’s aura. It was as if Bai Liluo was not present in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

However, Chu Feng was practically certain that Bai Liluo was in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. For him to not be able to sense her aura could only mean one thing. That Bai Liluo was so remarkable that she was able to escape the detection of the grand formation.

“Forget it. It’s better that I go and find that Wuma Shengjie first.”

The person Chu Feng wanted to see the most at that moment was not Bai Liluo. Instead, it was Wuma Shengjie.

Chu Feng wanted to quickly retrieve the Immortal Archery Bow from Wuma Shengjie.

“Woosh~~~”

With a single thought, Chu Feng disappeared and reappeared inside the palace.

Chu Feng knew where Wuma Shengjie was. As such, the place he appeared was right in front of Wuma Shengjie.

“This...”

However, when Chu Feng saw Wuma Shengjie, his expression changed enormously. With an astonished face, Chu Feng stood there in a stunned manner.
