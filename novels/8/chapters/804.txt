MGA: Chapter 805 - Uniting the Crippling Night Demon Sect

Chu Feng seemed to have already expected the Earth King’s invitation. In addition, since the day he paid respects to Qiu Canfeng, becoming his disciple, he already took himself as a part of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. So, there was simply no reason to refuse.

As a result, Chu Feng unhesitantly responded, “In the Crippling Night Demon Sect, experts are as common as clouds. It is the number one sect in the Eastern Sea Region. To be able to join is my honour! I can’t even thank Senior’s generosity quick enough, so how could I possibly refuse?”

“Haha, good, good, good!

“To be able to have a person like you, the Crippling Night Demon Sect will definitely be much more powerful in the future! With all of you representing the younger generation, we old ones can be at ease! Hahaha...” The Earth King was elated when he heard Chu Feng’s reply, and his smile on his aged face made it seem like a steamed bun.

As he spoke, he even looked at Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, and Fu Fengming. In his eyes, there were relieved emotions. He would have no need to worry the Crippling Night Demon Sect lacking any successors with these young ones here.

“Brother Wuqing, I welcome you for joining us. From now on, you truly become a part of our family.”

Xuan Xiaochao raised his wine bowl, and toasted Chu Feng. At the same time, You Tonghan and Fu Fengming also toasted him. It could be seen that they didn’t have any sort of envy, and instead, they welcomed him earnestly from the bottom of their hearts. That was truly a rare scene to behold.

“Brother Wuqing, I’ve heard you have a very powerful master. If I may ask, who is your master, to be able to develop such an excellent disciple such as yourself?” asked Fu Fengming expectantly.

“Senior Fu Fengming, it’s not that I want to hide it, but my master has forbidden me from saying his name. So, I do ask for your forgiveness,” said Chu Feng with a calm smile.

The Four Protectors were not on good terms with one another; they even viewed each other as enemies. Moreover, Chu Feng didn’t trust Fu Fengming and the others completely, so naturally, he would not tell them he was Qiu Canfeng’s disciple.

Also, Qiu Canfeng did tell Chu Feng to not tell anyone else in the Crippling Night Demon Sect where he was located, with the exception of Fu Liansheng. As such, Chu Feng had to diligently handle this issue.

“Hah, no matter, no matter! It’s your secret after all,” You Tonghan said unworriedly.

However, Fu Fengming lightly furrowed his brows. Then, he said, “Mm, the order of one’s master is akin to the size of the sky. That’s understandable. However, Brother Wuqing, since you’ve entered the Crippling Night Demon Sect, I do hope you can treat us as we treat you. If I may ask, what is your true name?”

“Yeah! Brother Wuqing, what are you called? And don’t say you’re truly called Wuqing!” You Tonghan also curiously looked at Chu Feng when they heard those words.

As he faced such gazes filled with desire, Chu Feng thought for a while, and decided not to hide it. He said, “Wuqing is indeed not my real name. I am Chu Feng.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Chu Feng? Good name, good name.

“Brother Chu Feng, don’t worry. You must be hiding your name because you have some sort of unspeakable hidden trouble. We won’t reveal this information.”

After knowing Chu Feng’s name, Fu Fengming and the others didn’t ask much and instead, starting chatting with him.

Then, later on, the Earth King and the others seniors went to rest. Only Chu Feng, Xuan Xiaochao, Fu Fengming, and You Tonghan remained up.

They chatted for a very long time, and the more they did, the more absorbed they got. Chu Feng not only felt that the three of them were rather decent, the three of them also respected Chu Feng quite a bit.

The four of them even called each other “brothers”, and with the power of wine, Chu Feng started revealing his admiration towards the Four Protectors, taking the opportunity to find out Fu Liansheng’s whereabouts.

“Brother Fu Fengming, my respect towards Senior Fu Liansheng is like an endlessly surging river, and also like the uncontrollable flooding of the Yellow River.

“To be able to see Senior Fu Liansheng would be a wish I, Chu Feng, always desired for. Brother Fu Fengming, would it be possible for you to introduce me to Senior Fu Liansheng?” Chu Feng looked at and asked Fu Fengming.

“This...” However, when he heard those words, Fu Fengming furrowed his brows slightly. A forehead of vertical black lines made it seem that he was in a very awkward situation.

“Ahh, Brother Chu Feng, it’s not that we want to lie to you, but as the disciples of the Protectors, even if others don’t know where our masters are, would we not know?

“However, our masters have very odd natures. They disallow us from telling anyone their locations. No matter who, it isn’t allowed.

“So, it’s not that Fu Fengming doesn’t trust you and isn’t willing to bring you to see Senior Fu Liansheng, it’s just that he truly doesn’t dare to.” You Tonghan helped Xuan Xiaochao explain when he heard Chu Feng’s words.

“Ah, I see. Brother Fu Fengming, I didn’t know about that, so I have offended you. Just ignore what I just said.” Chu Feng could tell that they didn’t seem to be tricking them, but he still intentionally put up a dispirited expression.

“Brother Chu Feng, you don’t need to be disappointed. At present, the Crippling Night Demon Sect has nearly reunited. My master will show himself. Since you are also a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, you will see my master sooner or later,” Fu Fengming said.

“Reunite the Crippling Night Demon Sect?” Chu Feng was taken aback.

“Mm. There was a reason why we set up a trap to lure the Immortal Execution Archipelago here.

“At present, the Crippling Night Demon Sect is in pieces. However, the Immortal Execution Archipelago views us as the biggest threat to them and they are hiddenly searching for the whereabouts of our members. After doing so, they kill them. Their goal is to hiddenly remove us, a future problem for them.

“If the Crippling Night Demon Sect does not fight back, then we will be in grave trouble. Our masters also know about this issue, so the reason we showed ourselves is actually due to the orders of our masters.

“Since they have very important statuses, they will temporarily avoid showing themselves. However, we three can represent them three. Look here: this is the Protector’s Badge. We will use this to reunite the Crippling Night Demon Sect.” As Fu Fengming spoke, he took out a special badge. You Tonghan and Xuan Xiaochao also took out theirs.

“But the Crippling Night Demon Sect has been split up for so long! What are all of you preparing to do?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

“The Immortal Execution Archipelago views us as a huge enemy so they have already started eradicating the members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect—our brothers. However, since they have been secretly doing this, many still do not know about it. After all, following ten-something years of peace, they have already gotten used to their current comfortable life.

“Right now, we want to put the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Immortal Execution Archipelago into a permanently conflicting relationship, so that those who’ve accustomed to the serene life will feel danger. Only then would they return to the Crippling Night Demon Sect sooner,” Fu Fengming explained.

“Is that successfully progressing?” Chu Feng’s words were on the most crucial part.

Fu Fengming and the others looked at each other, but all helplessly shook their heads and said, “If our masters appeared, then that would be better. After all, they possess great reputation and they are existences everyone from the Crippling Night Demon Sect revere.

“However, us, on the other hand... It’s too difficult. Our cultivations are after all too weak, nor do we have much fame. Even with our masters’ badges, it is very difficult to convince the young ones.

“Senior Earth King initially refused to come this time. So, that’s why we didn’t hope for his arrival. His appearance was actually quite a joyful surprise.

“However, we have made a good start by defeating the Immortal Execution Archipelago greatly in the Depraved Ravine. Moreover, we’ve set up an opposing relationship with them.

“I’m sure there will be more and more who will be willing to join our ranks, and this is all thanks to Brother Chu Feng. It’s all because of you that we were able to obtain victory! You’re the one who contributed the greatest.”

After speaking, when You Tonghan and the others looked at Chu Feng, there was unavoidably a bit more gratitude in their eyes.
