Chapter 5172: The Legacy

“Did you tell them that your father is still alive?” Chu Feng asked.

“I was the one who told them that I was an orphan. My mother is no longer around and my father doesn’t want me. How am I different from an orphan?” Yue Ling said with a bitter smile.

Chu Feng felt sorry for her.

Yue Ling probably had a blissful childhood, being able to stay by her parents' side as they traveled around the world. Who could have thought that a tragic incident would cause her mother’s death? Her father blamed himself for it and chose to leave Yue Ling here after burying her mother.

All of a sudden, Yue Ling found herself all alone. It was no wonder why she thought of herself as an orphan.

The feeling of suddenly losing it all must have felt awful.

“Benefactor, do you think that I have done wrong? I regretted saying those words, but the others believed me and I don’t want to change my words anymore. Many of them suspected a thing when I was able to enter the forbidden land, so it’s better for me to tell them that I am an orphan.”

Yue Ling looked at Chu Feng with swimming eyes, concerned about how he would view her.

“I don’t think that there’s anything wrong with what you did. Your father might have his reasons for leaving you, but you were still a child then. It was irresponsible for him to leave you alone. It’s only normal that you were angry with him back then,” Chu Feng said.

Yue Ling heaved a sigh of relief.

“I thought that you might have learned of this legacy from my father, but it was from Lord Zhenlong’s guidance instead,” Yue Ling said. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I’m sorry to say that I don't have any news on your father. Speaking of which, you mentioned that this sect used to be called the World Spiritist Technique Sect. I couldn’t help but notice that your sect tokens are empty, so I was wondering if there was a reason behind that,” Chu Feng asked.

“I once asked my master about that. It is the doing of Elder Zhao Xuzhi. There is a trial formation in our World Spiritist Technique Sect. If a day comes where no one is able to withstand the power of the trial formation, the name on the tokens and plaques of our World Spiritist Technique Sect will vanish. From that day on, the sect members won’t be allowed to use the name of the World Spiritist Technique Sect anymore,” Yue Ling explained.

“I see. Elder Zhao Xuzhi probably did that out of worry that the later generations will sully the name of the World Spiritist Technique Sect. Outsiders might not be aware of it, but Elder Zhao Xuzhi knows that the true founder of the World Spiritist Technique Sect is your ancestor,” Chu Feng said.

“That… I’m not sure about that,” Yue Ling replied.

“What does your sect call itself now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Internally, we still call ourselves the World Spiritist Technique Sect. Before outsiders, we call ourselves the Nameless Sect,” Yue Ling replied.

“You’re really going with ‘Nameless Sect’?”

Chu Feng chuckled in amusement before he reverted back to a serious expression.

“Yue Ling, the legacy here belongs to your clan. Is it really fine for me to comprehend it?” Chu Feng asked.

As much as he wanted to obtain the legacy, he wouldn’t force it if Yue Ling didn’t allow him to. This was simply how Chu Feng was like. To those who he deemed to be evil, he would have no qualms stealing everything from them. However, when it came to those who were kind-hearted like Yue Ling, he would respect their opinion and not take advantage of them.

“Benefactor, you have saved my life and I wish to repay you. Even if you weren’t here for the legacy, I would have told you about it. This is the most I can do for you,” Yue Ling replied.

“I was just helping out someone in need, but what you're offering me is much greater than that. This is a legacy that many would lay down their lives for. I’ll comprehend the legacy, but let’s call it equals with that. You shouldn’t call me benefactor anymore too,” Chu Feng said.

“Benefactor, do we really need to draw such a clear line?”

Yue Ling bit down on her lips and revealed a sorrowful look.

“I just don’t want you to continue calling me benefactor. I am Chu Feng. You can call me by my name. We can be friends instead,” Chu Feng quickly clarified.

“Alright. Benefactor, I’ll listen to you.”

A smile returned to Yue Ling’s face. Despite agreeing with Chu Feng, she was still calling him a benefactor. Chu Feng was left helpless at her obstinacy.

After a quick chat, he raised a request with her.

The boulder not only contained a powerful legacy but amazing recovery energy too. He thought that this might be of help to Song Yuwei’s condition, so he asked Yue Ling if he could bring Song Yuwei in here to treat her injuries.

Yue Ling accepted the request right away.

So, Chu Feng returned to Bitter Remembrance’s monastery and told them that he had found a way to treat Song Yuwei. He didn’t tell them the exact location since it concerned Yue Ling’s secret, and he felt obliged to keep it confidential.

This was the principle he stood by.

He carried Song Yuwei into the forbidden land and placed her by the boulder. Much to his delight, her condition started to improve within moments.

Chu Feng quickly informed City Lord Liang and Bitter Remembrance about the matter so that they wouldn’t have to worry about her anymore.

With his heart put at ease, City Lord Liang left the Bittersea Lower Realm to reunite with his clan members.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng began his attempt to comprehend the Legacy. Written on the boulder were the methods to manipulate spirit power.

He was reminded of the time in Lord Zhenlong’s ancient remnant when he competed with Bai Yunqing in a battle to construct a formation. Even though the two of them started on the same starting point, he still ended up losing to Bai Yunqing.

That clearly showed his inadequacies in controlling his spirit power as compared to Bai Yunqing.

This legacy held the key to resolving one of his weaknesses.

Of course, the more amazing a legacy was, the more difficult it would be to comprehend. It was not that Yue Ling’s ancestors were intentionally making things difficult for their descendants. On the contrary, the boulder was like a secret manual, stating everything clearly without any concealment whatsoever.

It was just that the secret manual was simply too complicated that a high level of intelligence was required to comprehend it.

That was also why Yue Ling was unable to grasp it.

Chu Feng was confident in his intelligence, but he struggled to comprehend it at the start too. However, he was soon able to make sense of the legacy, and from that point on, he was able to hasten his progress.

The legacy was indeed as amazing as Lord Zhenlong described it to be. It couldn’t make him achieve a breakthrough in his spirit power in the short term, but his deepened understanding of spirit power would allow him to grow at a much faster speed than before.

If he could fully grasp the legacy, his ability to manipulate spirit power would reach a completely different level. Putting aside Bai Yunqing, he might even be able to rival Bai Yunqing’s master in terms of sheer control over spirit power.

Thus, he completely immersed himself in deciphering the boulder.

Yue Ling would drop by the forbidden land every day, delivering her homemade desserts to him. She was good at cooking, and she would come up with different varieties every single day. Chu Feng found himself looking forward to what she would bring everyday.

What delighted Chu Feng the most was Song Yuwei’s recovery. Not only did she awaken from her coma, but her complexion was also looking much better than before. At this rate, it wouldn’t be long before she made a full recovery.

“Yue Ling is here again. I wonder what desserts she has prepared for our young master Chu Feng,” Song Yuwei said with a joyous smile upon sensing Yue Ling’s presence.

Chu Feng had quickly caught her up with everything that had happened. Song Yuwei had spoken with Yue Ling on several occasions and was very fond of her.

Crrrk!

The door to the palace was opened, and Yue Ling walked in. However, her hands were empty and her complexion looked awful.

Noticing that something was amiss, Chu Feng and Song Yuwei quickly rushed forward and asked, “Yue Ling, what’s wrong?”
