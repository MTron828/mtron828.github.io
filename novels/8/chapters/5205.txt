Chapter 5205: The Strongest Treasure in the World of Cultivation

“Old Cat, we just want to retrieve the item that Chu Feng has stolen from me. It’s not our intention to make things difficult for you. However, if you refuse to divulge Chu Feng’s location, the two of you will have to take the fall for him,” Xue Ji said.

Old Cat immediately hollered, “Brother Chu Feng, what did you take from Xue Ji? Hurry up and return it to her!”

“Screw you, Old Kitty!!!” Tao Wu berated.

He didn’t think that Old Cat would be so cowardly as to sell out Chu Feng.

“Is he in the vicinity?”

The Demon Spirit King immediately caught the drift upon hearing those words.

Boom! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In a mere instant, he exerted the oppressive might of a peak Half-God level cultivator. This oppressive might wouldn’t directly hurt anyone, but it carried a strong restraining force. Yet, even this wasn’t enough to hold Chu Feng in place.

This surprised Chu Feng. The concealment barrier turned out to be stronger than he had expected.

However, Tao Wu seemed to have anticipated this.

“It’s futile. Unless young brother Chu Feng chooses to show himself, you won’t be able to do anything to him,” Tao Wu said.

“You’re doubting my capabilities?” the Demon Spirit King asked in displeasure.

“I’m not doubting you. It’s the truth,” Tao Wu said.

The Demon Spirit King’s eyes turned wintry.

“Stop it,” Chu Feng spoke up.

“Chu Feng, you’re really here?” Xue Ji exclaimed in shock.

However, the one who was the most shocked of all was none other than the Demon Spirit King. At the same time, he felt embarrassed too. He didn’t think that Chu Feng would actually be hiding nearby when he couldn’t sense the latter at all.

“What do you want, Xue Ji?” Chu Feng asked.

“I just want the blue rock,” Xue Ji replied.

Chu Feng thought that Xue Ji wanted him to hand over the blue rock together with the Asura God Stones, but it turned out to just be the blue rock. That was still acceptable to him.

“Will you spare them if I hand the blue rock over to you?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, I will,” Xue Ji replied.

“Here you go.”

Chu Feng prepared to hand the blue rock over, and Eggy made no attempts to stop him. She knew just how loyal Chu Feng was to his friends and it was futile to try to persuade him otherwise.

“Hm?”

However, what happened afterward astonished both Chu Feng and Eggy.

Chu Feng had intended to toss the blue rock over to Xue Ji, but it wasn’t going over at all.

“What’s going on?” Eggy asked.

“It’s the concealment barrier. It isn’t allowing me to toss the blue rock over,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah? What do we do then?” Eggy asked.

“I’ll have no choice but to dispel the concealment barrier,” Chu Feng said.

“That won’t do! What if Xue Ji reneges on her promise? You’ll be in danger without the concealment barrier!” Eggy said nervously.

“Lad, where’s the rock? Are you trying to make a fool out of me?” the Demon Spirit King said in annoyance after waiting for a while.

“Chu Feng, give it to him. Otherwise, Brother Tao Wu and I will be in danger!” Old Cat pleaded with a crying tone.

It knew the Demon Spirit King well enough to know just how dangerous their situation was. That was also the reason it was so afraid.

Chu Feng was put in a spot.

Just as Eggy had said, he could at least ensure his own safety with the concealment formation. However, if he didn’t hand the blue rock over to Xue Ji, Tao Wu and Old Cat would likely meet their end here.

“Lad, do you want them to die?” the Demon Spirit King threatened.

Seeing that the Demon Spirit King was really going to make a move, Chu Feng dispelled his concealment formation without any hesitation.

“Xue Ji, I’ll return this rock to you now. Let them go.”

Chu Feng tossed the blue rock over to Xue Ji.

“Is this the right one?” the Demon Spirit King asked.

“Mmhm,” Xue Ji replied with a nod.

Boom!

However, a powerful oppressive might suddenly crushed down on Chu Feng. Without the concealment formation to protect him this time around, his body was immediately restrained.

If the Demon Spirit King willed so, he could wring all of the blood out of Chu Feng right away.

“You must be tired of living to dare bully my Xue Ji,” the Demon Spirit King said coldly.

“Forget it,” Xue Ji said.

“Xue Ji, are you going to let them off just like that?” the Demon Spirit King asked in astonishment.

“Let them go,” Xue Ji said.

The Demon Spirit King’s astonishment deepened. In the end, he retracted his oppressive might.

“Count yourselves lucky that my Xue Ji is in a good mood today!” the Demon Spirit King said before bringing Xue Ji into the depths of the pit.

“Young brother Chu Feng, why did you show yourself? You could have just thrown the blue rock to them!” Tao Wu asked.

“There’s something weird about that concealment formation. It’s incredibly powerful, but it seems to prevent interaction between those on different sides of the barrier. I wasn’t able to throw the blue rock out no matter what I did, so I had no choice but to dispel it,” Chu Feng replied.

“Is that the case? Brother Chu Feng, you’re really a loyal friend! At the very least, you’re much better than that Old Kitty!” Tao Wu complimented.

“H-how am I not loyal? I mean, I know the Demon Spirit King better than the rest of you. We would have died if we didn’t hand the blue rock over!” Old Cat explained.

“Cut the bullshit. You’re just a disloyal bastard. I’ve decided not to take you with me anymore. Go do whatever you want.”

Tao Wu seemed to be truly infuriated this time around.

“W-what?! Brother Tao, I-I-I-I… Brother Chu Feng, hurry up and say something for me. I’m really not a disloyal bastard!”

Old Cat could only turn to Chu Feng for help.

“Elder, we have already been through so much together. Why don’t we just take him with us?” Chu Feng said.

“Fine. Since young brother Chu Feng insists on it… Remember this, Old Kitty. If you dare to betray us once more, I’ll kill you with a single smack of my palm!”

Tao Wu shot a deathly glare at Old Cat.

Following that, he wrapped Chu Feng and Old Cat with his martial power and continued diving deeper into the pit. Moments later, there was a strong gust of wind blowing upward that kept countless cultivators and world spiritists, including those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, from advancing any further.

It was then that Tao Wu took out three pills and handed one to Old Cat and Chu Feng. This pill also contained a formation within it, similar to the one with the concealment formation Chu Feng had ingested earlier.

As soon as they consumed the pill, a defensive barrier formed around them. The barrier granted them immunity to the gust of wind, allowing them to dive further deeper down till they finally arrived at the massive gate once more.

They could see that the gust of wind was coming from the gate itself. However, with the help of the pill, the three of them were able to pass through the gate without any issues.

The wind abated as soon as they stepped over the gate. They continued diving deeper into the pit, and it didn’t take them long to reach its bottom.

They found themselves faced with three spirit formation gates. The spirit formation gates located on the left and right were open, whereas the one located in the middle was closed. However, it had a glowing human silhouette floating above it.

This silhouette was emanating specks of light reminiscent of countless stars, as if the entire cosmos was encapsulated within it. The realization of that changed their impression of the silhouette, making it feel like a being wielding incomparable powers.

Both Chu Feng and Old Cat were immediately drawn to the silhouette. In particular, Chu Feng’s eyes were glowing.

They didn’t understand what the silhouette was, but they could tell that it was out of the ordinary.

“Holy shit, we struck gold! This is one of the legendary Nine Great God Souls!” Tao Wu exclaimed.

“Nine Great God Souls? What’s that?”

Both Chu Feng and Old Cat turned to Tao Wu for answers.

“The Nine Great God Souls is a legendary treasure amongst treasures. Let me put it this way for you. There are countless types of Divine Powers and bloodlines, but there are only nine of these Nine Great God Souls in the entire world of cultivation. They are spread out across the different galaxies, nurtured over a very long period of time.

“You’re probably aware that most natural oddities are born from the essence of the world, but the Nine Great God Souls are nurtured by the Nine Galaxies. If there’s a tier to natural oddities, the Nine Great God Souls are definitely ranked at the highest tier! It’s an unparalleled treasure of the world of cultivation, the dream of all world spiritists!” Tao Wu said.
