Chapter 4981: Turning a Blind Eye

“Junior Song, please don’t think too much into it. Young hero Chu Feng is someone far beyond our reach. We wouldn’t dare to harbor such thoughts.”

Frightened by Song Yun, Song Feifei and the others quickly answered her humbly. They even tactfully chose to do so via voice transmission.

Song Yun responded with a faint smile before turning her attention back to the apple she was munching on.&nbsp;

By this point, it had already become apparent to Song Feifei and the others that Song Yun wasn’t as sweet and innocent as she appeared to be on the surface. There was something inherently frightening about her.

So, Song Feifei quickly led her sisters into the palaces to collect the bodies of their two deceased comrades.&nbsp;

Song Yun wasn’t too surprised by their response. She slowly turned her head around to gaze upon what appeared to be empty space.&nbsp;

Her movement caught Zi Ling by surprise.

Chu Feng had told Zi Ling to conceal herself out of fear of complicating the situation, but the direction Song Yun was looking at happened to be where Zi Ling was standing. In fact, the two of them were even meeting eyes.

“Is that young miss able to see me?” Zi Ling murmured under her breath.

It didn’t appear to be a coincidence based on the look on Song Yun’s face.

Soon, the battle died down and two silhouettes descended from the sky. They were none other than Chu Feng and Song Xue’er.

“Big sis Xue’er, are you fine?”

Song Yun quickly rose into the air to welcome Song Xue’er back.

“I’m fine. Those old things aren’t a match for me. Chu Feng did scare me a little though. What happened to your cultivation? Were you hiding your cultivation all this while?”&nbsp;

Song Xue’er looked at Chu Feng with a hint of astonishment in her eyes.&nbsp;

While she did manage to stand her ground against those elders, it took the full extent of her abilities in order to do so. Yet, the moment Chu Feng joined the fray, those elders swiftly fell one after another.

With his rank three Martial Exalted level cultivation stacked with his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor, Chu Feng had raised his cultivation to rank five Martial Exalted level earlier. With such strength, not even Song Xue’er would have been a match for him, let alone those elders.

Song Xue’er clearly remembered how Chu Feng was only at early-Utmost Exalted level when they first met. Back then, he was nothing more than an ant before her, a trivial existence she could easily obliterate with a smack of her hand.&nbsp;

Yet, their positions were reversed within such a short period of time. How could she possibly not be shocked?

“Big brother Chu Feng isn’t the type to conceal his cultivation,” Song Yun said.

In contrast, Song Yun had never doubted Chu Feng of concealing his cultivation. She was certain that this was the result of his recent growth.

“You know me the best,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Of course. Still, big brother Chu Feng, aren’t you growing too fast? At this rate… it won’t take long before you overpower my mother,” Song Yun said with twinkling eyes.&nbsp;

She looked incredibly adorable.&nbsp;

“You’re making fun of me. How could I catch up with your mother that quickly?&nbsp;

“Speaking of which, these people only reacted in such a manner because they received orders to do so. If that’s the case, something must have happened over on the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea’s side. Let’s hurry over. We might just be able to offer some help,” Chu Feng said.

“I’m grateful for your concern, young friend Chu Feng, but we’re fine,” a feminine voice suddenly sounded.

Following that, three women appeared in the sky not too far away from them.&nbsp;

One of them had delicate skin that resembled natural jade, but she gave off an air of complete purity and innocence. She was slightly older than Song Yun, but oddly enough, she felt even more innocent than the latter.&nbsp;

She was none other than Wang Yuxian.

Wang Yuxian was visibly excited to see Chu Feng, and she quickly waved toward him. However, she didn’t rush to his side right away because of the two middle-aged women standing in front of her.&nbsp;

Both of them emanated an air of grace that hinted at how stunning they must have been in their youth. Despite being already past their prime, they still possessed charms that could win over men.&nbsp;

One of them was the Lady of Dao Sea and the other was the Godwish Grandmother.

“Junior Chu Feng pays respects to the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea,” Chu Feng quickly clasped his fist and greeted them.

Even though his cultivation was already getting close to their level, he still felt a great deal of respect for them due to the help he had received from them in the past.&nbsp;

“Young friend Chu Feng, you’re truly an outstanding young man to have reached Martial Exalted level at such a young age,” the Godwish Grandmother offered a compliment to Chu Feng.

“You’re flattering me, elder. I was just lucky,” Chu Feng replied.

“It isn\\\'t just&nbsp;luck. My big brother Chu Feng is the number one prodigy in the vast world of cultivation!” Song Yun suddenly spoke up. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She rushed forward to hug Chu Feng’s arm, a clear act of intimacy.

Her action didn’t really surprise the crowd, but Wang Yuxian and the hidden Zi Ling couldn’t help but reveal looks of astonishment.

“Master.”

It was then that sobbing sounds echoed in the air. Song Feifei and the others floated into the sky with the bodies of their two fallen sisters. They quickly explained the situation to the Lady of Dao Sea.

“Haa, I have underestimated them.”

The Lady of Dao Sea felt sorrow and self-reproach upon seeing that two of her disciples had been harmed. Her disciples were as good as her own daughters, having raised them from a young age.&nbsp;

“Young friend Chu Feng, you have my deepest gratitude. If not for your intervention, my disciples would have been sullied by those beasts,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

She would probably have still been able to save Song Feifei and the others even if Chu Feng hadn’t appeared, but it was likely that those beasts would have already taken advantage of them by then.&nbsp;

The women of the Dao Sea were extremely innocent, and they viewed their honor to be even more important than their lives. They wouldn’t want to continue living if they were to be sullied by other men.&nbsp;

“Elder, please don’t say that. I’m to be blamed for this. If only I was a step faster, this tragedy might not have happened,” Chu Feng replied.

The atmosphere couldn’t help but become heavy. Those who had lost their lives were more or less related to them.

There was one exception though.

Song Xue’er was much calmer, and upon hearing the news, she subconsciously turned her gaze toward Song Yun. When she saw the latter’s reddened eyes, she couldn’t but feel a little conflicted.&nbsp;

She was well aware of Song Yun’s strength, and she knew that Song Yun had been in the area all this while.&nbsp;

Song Xue’er couldn’t help those female disciples because she was tied down by the elders, but Song Yun could have easily intervened. If she was willing to lend a helping hand, those female disciples wouldn’t have to undergo such an ordeal.

However, Song Yun chose to turn a blind eye to their fate.
