Chapter 5911: The Unpredictable Wen Xue

Chu Feng hoped that the Heaven-devouring Qilin would regain its consciousness, but he didn’t receive any response whatsoever. This meant he had no choice but to wait and rely on himself to raise his cultivation.

“Where do we go next?” Zi Ling asked.

“We’ll first head to the Immortal Sea Galaxy,” Chu Feng replied.

“I thought there’s another place you’d like to go in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” Zi Ling asked. Then, she shook her head and replied with a smile, “Ah, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master has already made a move. We can’t afford to wait.”

“There’s another reason,” Chu Feng replied.

“What is it?” Zi Ling asked.

“I wanted to explore some of the places I couldn’t in the past now that I have grown stronger, thinking that I might find fortuitous encounters there. However, our trip to the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain made me realize that there were still existences beyond my reach in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. We were fortunate that the Three Saints Monstrous Clan has close ties with my father and doesn’t bear any malicious intent toward us, but the same can’t be said about the other places,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re right.” Zi Ling understood Chu Feng’s concerns, and she agreed with them too.

The two of them first paid a visit to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster to relay their intent to leave before looking for Wen Xue.

“Wen Xue, I shan’t beat around the bush. We’ll be competing with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion over several items next, and there’s no doubt it’ll be dangerous. You need to carefully think it through whether you wish to travel with us or not,” Chu Feng said.

“Junior Chu Feng, you’re looking down on me. Do I, Wen Xue, look like someone who fears death?” Wen Xue pouted as if to express her confidence and bravery, but her adorable face only undermined her attempt.

“Very well, let’s get going then.”

Chu Feng began making his way to the Immortal Sea Galaxy with Zi Ling and Wen Xue.

The latter two spent their time cultivating on the way, whereas Chu Feng took out all the items he had obtained from the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild that could aid in Eggy’s recovery. He even took his time to enhance the effects of those items with a formation each.

Unfortunately, the result was disappointing.

Chu Feng was at a loss. It felt like nothing worked on Eggy. He was glad that her condition showed no signs of deteriorating even though she wasn’t recovering either. He heaved a sigh, knowing he would have to seek an alternative solution.

Soon, the three of them arrived at one of the Immortal Sea Galaxy’s Upper Realms, where one of the key fragments was.

Chu Feng didn’t contact Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy as he didn’t want to add to their trouble. He thought that he should settle his affairs by himself, not to mention he was going against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion here.

Chu Feng knew the exact position of the key, but he didn’t head there straight via the teleportation formation. He was worried the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had already sent their men here, so he knew he needed to proceed carefully.

Unlike the tense Chu Feng and Zi Ling, Wen Xue looked much more relaxed. The first thing she did after leaving the teleportation formation was to stretch her back before scanning her surroundings with excited eyes.

She couldn’t get a good look on the ground, so she rose to the sky. Moments later, she shook her head in disappointment and murmured, “The Immortal Sea Galaxy feels the same as the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.”

“There is a difference,” Chu Feng replied.

“What is it?” Wen Xue asked.

“The cultivators here are far stronger than in our Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Maintain a low profile here and try not to cause any trouble,” Chu Feng replied.

“Will Junior Chu Feng cover me if I cause trouble?” Wen Xue asked with a mischievous smile.

“I’ll help you if others are being unreasonable. However, if you’re the one messing with others, you should resolve it yourself. I stand on the side of reason,” Chu Feng replied.

“What if it’s Senior Zi Ling?” Wen Xue asked.

“Of course I’ll help Zi Ling.”

“Even if she’s the one being unreasonable.”

“That goes without saying.” Chu Feng’s answer was without a shred of hesitation.

“Tsk. All your talk about standing on the side of reason is a load of bull, you hypocrite!” Wen Xue crossed her arms and rolled her eyes.

“Zi Ling is different,” Chu Feng replied.

“How are we different? We’re from the same sect.”

“Zi Ling is my lover.”

“Ah, I get it. Will you unconditionally help me if I become your lover too?” Wen Xue immediately turned to Zi Ling afterward and asked, “Oops, I blurted that out. Senior Zi Ling, are you angry?”

“I know you’re joking,” Zi Ling replied magnanimously.

Wen Xue narrowed her eyes. “What if I’m not joking?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Zi Ling was startled, but she soon replied with a smile, “Then we’ll have to see what you’re capable of. I can’t help who Brother Chu Feng likes.”

“You mean it?” Wen Xue asked.

“I do,” Zi Ling replied.

The two of them stared at each other for an entire minute as the atmosphere turned peculiar.

Chu Feng could tell that Wen Xue was messing with Zi Ling, but he didn’t say a word as he thought that it would have been excessive. He believed that Zi Ling could deal with it.

“I’m just joking around! Senior Zi Ling, you don’t have to look so serious. I am a tactful person, so you don’t need to worry about me intruding into your little world. I’ll go take a look around first!” Wen Xue revealed a brilliant smile.

The space around her warped, and she vanished into thin air.

Zi Ling immediately rose into the air to inspect the position where Wen Xue previously stood. She was flustered as she couldn’t find Wen Xue anywhere.

“Don’t bother searching. She’s already gone.” In contrast, Chu Feng wasn’t nervous at all.

“Big brother Chu Feng, did she deceive us? Is she merely using us as an excuse to escape from my master’s side?” Zi Ling descended from the sky as she asked.

“This has nothing to do with us. Lord Sectmaster has already given her permission; Wen Xue can choose to leave if she wants. I think this works fine. It would have been inconvenient for us otherwise,” Chu Feng replied.

“I can’t even tell how she left. She must have been hiding her means,” Zi Ling replied.

“She left using a means she prepared beforehand, though this means that she has been hiding tricks up her sleeves. You don’t need to think too much about it. In the first place, it’s a stretch to say that she’s a junior. She’s an old monster who has lived for countless years. It’d be foolish to judge her by the standards of a junior, be it her behavior or cultivation speed,” Chu Feng replied.

He wasn’t surprised as he had never thought that Wen Xue was a normal person.

“All right, let’s ignore her for now. We still have business to deal with.” At this point, Zi Ling suddenly revealed a worried frown. “Big brother Chu Feng, is there a chance that Wen Xue might defect to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

Chu Feng frowned.

Wen Xue craved power, and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was the strongest power in the present world of cultivation. It was not unthinkable for her to defect to them.
