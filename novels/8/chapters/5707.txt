Chapter 5707: Pleasant Partnership

“How can I trust you?” Chu Feng asked.

“So be it. I know you’re only able to stop the formation; you can’t activate it on your own accord. Once the backlash stops, the formation won’t reactivate as long as I make no attempt to kill you or escape. By then, you need not dream about getting anything from me!”

Surprisingly, the pig was able to see through the formation.

Chu Feng was at a loss for words. The pig was emotionally unstable. It was still acting subserviently a moment ago, but it was suddenly taking a more domineering attitude.

However, Chu Feng refused to give in and said, “Do you think I care for that? If you have such a spunk, why don’t you clench your teeth and endure it to the very end?”

“A-aren’t you a cultivator? Don’t you want to raise your cultivation?” The pig was taken aback.

“Of course I do, but I only take the carrot and not the stick,” Chu Feng replied.

The pig immediately changed its attitude and said, “Grandpa Feng, I was wrong. Don’t hold it against me. As they say, it’s better to make friends than foes. Why don’t we work together and make the best out of this situation?”

“That’s more like it,” Chu Feng said as he stopped the formation. “So, what can you do to raise my cultivation?”

As soon as the formation was dispelled, the pig’s subservience vanished without a trace, and it stood up on its hind legs like a human. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You have seen what I’m capable of. I might look like a pig now, but that’s only because I haven’t recovered my strength yet,” the pig said.

“What’s your background? You don’t seem like a newborn. Do you have memories of your past?” Chu Feng asked.

“Don’t try to probe into my background. I’ll work with you since I’m restrained by the formation. You’ll benefit greatly as long as you obediently listen to me,” the pig said arrogantly.

Chu Feng paid no heed to its arrogance and instead asked, “What kind of benefits can you offer me?”

The pig closed its eyes and began sniffing around. At this moment, it looked more like a dog than a pig. After sniffing the vicinity, it pointed in a direction and said, “Are there descendants from the Dragon Clan in that direction?”

“Descendants of the Dragon Clan?” Chu Feng murmured as he looked over.

He initially thought the pig was saying that there were monstrous beasts with the Dragon Clan’s bloodline in this realm, but it quickly occurred to him that the pig might be referring to something further away. “How far away is that descendant you speak of?”

“Very far away. It’s in another galaxy,” the pig replied.

“You must be referring to the Totem Galaxy. It’s under the rule of the Totem Dragon Clan, so there are indeed descendants of the Dragon Clan there,” Chu Feng said.

“Totem Dragon Clan? Bring me over,” the pig instructed.

“For what?” Chu Feng asked.

“I smell something good there. Let me devour it, and I’ll be able to produce the aura of a god beast. The aura can aid in your cultivation,” the pig said.

“Are you really a god beast?” Chu Feng asked.

“What do you think?” the pig asked.

“Heaven-devouring Pig?”

“I am a Heaven-devouring Qilin.”

“You do possess memories of the past. Why don’t you tell me what you, a Heaven-devouring Qilin, is capable of?” Chu Feng asked with narrowed eyes.

“What memories? A mere mortal like you can’t begin to imagine the powers of a god beast. This is my heritage, knowledge that I was born with. You don’t know a thing at all!” the pig sneered.

“Drop your act. You clearly possess memories of the past. Are you a formidable existence from the Ancient Era?” Chu Feng asked.

“Cut the crap and get to the point. Will you work together with me?” the pig asked.

“The treasure you speak of, is it a natural oddity or a Totem Dragon Clansman?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course it’s a natural oddity! I don’t kill the innocent,” the pig replied.

“We can go and check it out, but you aren’t allowed to touch it if it’s already in someone else’s possession. The Totem Dragon Clan is my friend’s clan,” Chu Feng said.

“Hoh, I’m surprised you have so many friends,” the pig scoffed.

“I don’t have many friends, but they are good people. Let’s go. Don’t try to pull any tricks, or else you’ll have a lot to suffer for when the formation intensifies again,” Chu Feng said.

“I know, I know. Hold still for a moment,” the pig said as it turned into a whiff of golden aura that surged toward Chu Feng.

The formation didn’t trigger this time around, as the pig wasn’t trying to hurt Chu Feng or flee. Rather, it turned into a golden mark and imprinted itself on the chest area of Chu Feng’s robe. This mark was in the shape of a pig, though it looked much more adorable than the person in question.

“What are you doing?” Chu Feng asked.

“What am I doing? I can’t possibly follow you around, right? I am not your pet. It’s much more convenient to do this,” the pig said.

“I don’t get anything out of this,” Chu Feng remarked.

“What benefits do you want? We’re in a mutual partnership. You bring me some benefits first, and I’ll return the favor to you. Besides, I saved your life earlier. You would have been devoured by the saint beast earlier if I hadn’t made a move. That means that you owe me a huge favor!” the pig exclaimed.

Chu Feng was rendered speechless, though he had to concede on that. While he would have been able to escape from that crisis too, he would have to waste Lord Qin Jiu’s talisman for that.

In a way, the pig did save him from having to use that talisman.

Chu Feng proceeded to activate the teleportation formation, but his destination was not the Totem Galaxy but the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. He could get to the Totem Galaxy much faster this way.

“Brat, did you get the direction wrong? We’re getting further away,” the pig remarked.

“It’s a shortcut,” Chu Feng replied.

“Shortcut? It’s not too shabby that you have reached your level of cultivation at your age, but what shortcuts could someone of your measly strength possibly know?”

The pig didn’t have a high opinion of Chu Feng, and Chu Feng didn’t bother explaining himself either. He continued marching forward, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before the grand Nine Heavens Secret Domain.

“That looks like a powerhouse’s forbidden land. There’s a powerful formation guarding the area. You won’t be able to get in there with your cultivation level.”

The pig could tell how formidable the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s barrier was even though they were still a distance away. However, Chu Feng showed no intention to stop.

“Brat, don’t mess around. I haven’t lived enough yet! I’ll let you know I haven’t accepted you as my partner yet; I’m still evaluating whether you’re qualified or not. If this is how reckless you are, I’ll have to consider terminating our partnership. At most, I’ll just wait tens of thousands of years till you die, and I’ll be free once more!”

The pig panicked as Chu Feng came closer and closer to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Once he was a certain distance away from it, he formed a hand seal, and a powerful surge of teleportation energy enveloped him.

He bypassed the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s barrier and directly entered the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, specifically heading toward where the Conqueror’s Steles and the eight Constellation Gates were.

He clasped his fist and greeted, “Elder, sorry for intruding.”

He was talking to the brush. He had never seen the woman with divine eyes before, so he thought that the brush was the only one here.

There was no response, so he entered the Totem Constellation Gate and was brought into a teleportation passageway.

Upon seeing how fast the teleportation passageway was, the pig remarked in awe, “I knew from the start that you’re no ordinary person! My eyes would never fail me. It looks like we’ll have a pleasant partnership!”
