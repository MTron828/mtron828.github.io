Chapter 2235 - Make You Pay

“Showing no respect to your elders and superiors, you’re courting death!”

Seeing that Grandmaster Pocket had been beaten to a state of vomiting blood, Daoist Three Swords became furious.

Perhaps due to his fury, Daoist Three Swords’s attacks grew sharper and sharper. Unfortunately, regardless of how much sharper his attacks had become, they had not become stronger.

The world spirit armor had completely sealed away his martial power. At that moment, the only power he could use was the power bestowed to him by his world spirit armor. In fact, even his defensive ability was far inferior to before.

Like this, not to mention injuring the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, Daoist Three Swords was unable to even land a single attack on him.

At that moment, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was receiving the attacks from Daoist Three Swords without fighting back. He was dodging while mocking, “Daoist Three Swords, what you’ve said is incorrect. I am not showing no respect to my elders and superiors.”

“Rather, it is truly because the rules are like this. Thus, you must not blame me. It is truly not me who is being ruthless in my attacks. Rather, it is that I must defeat you all in order to win.”

Although the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors spoke as if he was innocent, the smile on his face allowed everyone to know that he did not mean the words he said at all.

“Enough of your nonsense! Fight me!” Daoist Three Swords shouted angrily.

“Since you refuse to appreciate my kindness, do not blame me for being impolite,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors unleashed his attack.

Once he started to attack, Daoist Three Swords was completely suppressed.

Furthermore, his attacks grew more and more ferocious. He was simply incomparably overbearing. Faced with them, Daoist Three Swords was only able to defend. He had lost all ability to fight back.

Step by step, Daoist Three Swords was forced back. He was at an absolute disadvantage.

“Bang~~~”

Even though he was already retreating the entire time, Daoist Three Swords failed to dodge an attack in time, and ended up being struck by the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

After that punch, many more punches were shot toward him.

“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”

In merely an instant, several punches landed on Daoist Three Swords.

Faced with these attacks, Daoist Three Swords lost all ability to fight back, and was knocked back repeatedly.

If Grandmaster Pocket was merely vomiting a small amount of blood from the corners of his mouth, then Daoist Three Swords was currently violently spraying blood from his mouth.

However, even with this being the case, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors still showed no signs of stopping. Even though he had forced Daoist Three Swords into a corner, he was still violently beating at Daoist Three Swords with his fists.

“Stop! He has already lost!” Chu Feng shouted.

“Lost? You are not the one who gets to decide that. Rather, I am the one who gets to decide that,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors mocked.

“Damn it!” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was so furious that he started to tightly clench his fists.

He truly had the urge to rush in and teach the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors a lesson. Unfortunately, his world spirit armor had yet to finish forming. As such, he was simply unable to enter the spirit formation at all.

Seeing the anger on Chu Feng’s face, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors revealed an even more complacent expression. He said, “What’s up? You’re feeling displeased?”

“If you’re not pleased with the way I do things, then come on in and beat me, you damned trash.”

After saying those words, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors turned his gaze to his surroundings and shouted, “I know that many of you people here disapprove of my actions! However, who among you all could possibly stop me?!”

“In this place, I am king! I can do whatever I please! None of you can stop me!”

After saying those words, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors raised his fist once again. He was actually planning to continue to beat down on Daoist Three Swords.

It could be seen that the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors felt deep hatred for Daoist Three Swords threatening him earlier.

That is why he had decided to use this opportunity to ruthlessly beat up Daoist Three Swords. Even though Daoist Three Swords had already lost the ability to fight, he still refused to stop.

Right at that moment, an extremely imposing voice suddenly sounded. It was the Golden Crane True Immortal.

“It is merely a spar. He has already been defeated. Is there really a need for you to be this overbearing?”

“Remember, this place is merely an arena set up by me, and not a place for you all to settle your personal grudges.”

Once the Golden Crane True Immortal’s words were heard, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors did not dare to strike down with his raised hand.

It was an awkward situation. He who was boasting earlier was left in a very awkward situation right now.

Daoist Three Swords spit out the blood in his mouth. Then, he snorted coldly and said, “It seems that there is still someone capable of stopping you here.”

“Fortunately, there is someone capable of stopping me. Else, you’d be left in a very miserable state,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said. As matters stood, he no longer cared about revealing his intentions of teaching Daoist Three Swords, this expert martial cultivator, a lesson.

Daoist Three Swords was not angry. Instead, with a beaming smile, he said, “After we leave this place, I will have you know what miserable really means.”

Hearing those words, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors suddenly frowned. He was scared.

Although Daoist Three Swords was smiling, he felt a frightening chill from Daoist Three Swords’ smiling gaze.

He had suddenly realized that Daoist Three Swords was truly angry. Likely, he would not be willing to let this matter go. After leaving this place, Daoist Three Swords would definitely come to teach him a lesson.

Unfortunately, it was already too late for him to be scared now. Thus, he did not continue to say anything, and did not dare to look at Daoist Three Swords again. Instead, he turned his gaze to Liu Xiaoli.

The reason for that was because everyone else here had been defeated by him. Only Liu Xiaoli remained standing.

“Do you know why I left you for last?” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors asked Liu Xiaoli.

“Why?” Liu Xiaoli asked.

“Because I knew that you were with that Chu Feng.”

“That Chu Feng is so very amazing, eh? So very arrogant, no? Originally, I planned to properly teach him a lesson, and let him know who the true genius in terms of world spirit techniques is .”

“Unfortunately, he is not even qualified to enter this place.”

“Thus, I can only aim the lesson that I’ve prepared for him at you,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors looked to Liu Xiaoli with a mischievous smile.

“Enough rubbish, if you want to attack me, then go ahead,” Liu Xiaoli said in a disapproving manner. She seemed to have already guessed what the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors planned to do. Thus, she revealed a very unyielding appearance.

“As you wish,” As the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors spoke, he prepared to attack Liu Xiaoli.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s voice sounded again. “If you dare to be too excessive, I will make you pay.”

“What did you say? Say it again!” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors suddenly stopped his hand and turned around to ask Chu Feng.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s brows narrowed. Coldness filled his eyes. He stared at the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors and spoke one word at a time, “If you dare to be too excessive, I will make you pay!”

“Hahaha!!!” After Chu Feng’s words left his mouth, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors burst into loud laughter.

“Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, you are truly capable of making me laugh. It would be one thing for Daoist Three Swords to threaten me. Yet, trash like you actually also dares to threaten me? What makes you think you can threaten me?”

“In terms of world spirit techniques, you’re not even qualified to set foot into this place.”

“In terms of cultivation, you’re so weak that I can crush you to death with a single finger.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“You want to make me pay? How exactly are you going to do that?” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors mocked.

Once his words were heard, many of the people present began to shake their heads.

Even though what the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors had said was too excessive, it was the truth.

As for Chu Feng, he did not answer. However, his cold gaze was fixed onto the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors the entire time.
