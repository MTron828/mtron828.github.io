Chapter 3303 - Unsealing Failure

“Humph, he actually knows his capabilities.”

After Chu Feng voiced his desire to not participate, those geniuses from the other powers revealed smiles on their faces.

They felt that Chu Feng’s behavior, to not participate of his own accord, was one of one who knew his own ability. The reason for that was because they felt, from the bottoms of their hearts, that Chu Feng was nothing more than trash. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

However, to their surprise, right after they started smiling, Chu Feng spoke again, “If none of them are capable of unsealing that grand formation, it wouldn’t be too late for me to act then.” “若是他们都无人能够破开那阵法，那时我再出手，也是不迟。”楚枫说道。

“The hell did that guy say? Is he crazy?”

Chu Feng’s words immediately drew scowls from those geniuses.

If it wasn’t for the fact that they saw the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief standing beside Chu Feng, they would definitely curse him out right away.

They were truly incapable of tolerating someone that they looked down on boasting like that.

It was actually only the Liangqiu Sisters and Wuma Shengjie who were able to remain relatively undisturbed by Chu Feng’s behavior.

After all, compared to others, they knew a lot more about his capabilities.

“Brother Chu, that young friend you’ve brought along is quite humorous,” That Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with a smile on his face.

He was not mocking Chu Feng. However, his word choice of ‘humorous’ had revealed that he did not believe in Chu Feng either.

“Brother Wuma, whilst I do not dare to speak for all our clan’s younger generations... his attainments in terms of world spirit techniques is the strongest among our clan’s younger generations. Thus, he is not being arrogant when he said those words. Instead, he has the confidence,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Oh?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s response came as a great surprise to the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder. The reason for that was because he was extremely serious when he said those words. He did not seem to be joking at all.

Judging by his appearance, he seemed to truly think that that member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation that stood beside him possessed world spirit techniques that surpassed all the younger generations present.

“Brother Chu Feng, perhaps you didn’t know about this. When Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng came here, he brought his two junior sisters with him.”

“Allow me to introduce them to you. These two are respectively Grandmaster Liangqiu’s seventeenth and eighteenth disciples, Miss Liangqiu Hongyue and Miss Liangqiu Lanyue.”

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder pointed to the Liangqiu Sisters standing nearby. As he spoke, he waved his hand and said, “Two misses, allow me to introduce this person to you. This person here is our clan’s honored guest, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.”

After the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief finished introducing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Liangqiu Hongyue, Liangqiu Lanyue, Wuma Shengjie and the other people of the younger generation present all walked over to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and bowed simultaneously.

Although they were all individuals with extraordinary status and extremely arrogant, it remained that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had seniority and status surpassing their own. Thus, as a standpoint of etiquette, they had to greet him respectfully.

After all, they knew that their respective seniors and elders were all watching them from within the formation core.

“Young friends, there is no need for you all to be this overly courteous.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled. Then, he turned his eyes to Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue. He said, “Two misses, we have met before. Do you two still remember that?”

“Senior, we remember,” Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue replied.

Seeing that, not only did the expressions of the other younger generations change, but even the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder revealed a change in expression.

‘Wouldn’t this mean that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was already acquainted with the Liangqiu Sisters?’

‘However, seeing the Liangqiu Sisters there, he actually still dared to make such boasting claims. Is that youngster from the Chu Heavenly Clan really that exceptional, or does he not know the strength of the Liangqiu Sisters?’

‘He definitely doesn’t know the Liangqiu Sisters’ actual strength. Yes, that must be it.’

Thinking of that, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said, “These two young misses are truly worthy of being Grandmaster Liangqiu’s personal disciples. Although you’re so young, the two of you are already Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritists.”

“Two misses truly possess exceptional talent. It is no wonder that Grandmaster Liangqiu is so fond of you two,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded. However, the way he responded seemed like he had already anticipated the Liangqiu Sisters to be that powerful, and was not at all surprised.

This caused the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder to become increasingly confused.

Right at that moment, a person from the other younger generations said, “Senior, it is time for us to unseal that formation,”

He was actually very displeased by the attitude displayed by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He felt that it was simply impossible to talk to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. As such, he did not wish to continue to linger.

“Go ahead, go ahead,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief waved his hand with a smile.

Then, those people of the younger generation all walked over to their designated places.

They were standing before the Ancient Era’s remnant.

The Liangqiu Sisters were ordering the people of the younger generation present, teaching them how to cooperate with them as they set up their formation.

It turned out that it was a spirit formation that could only be controlled by a single person. As for the others... they could only release their spirit power to assist in the activation of that spirit formation.

The person who was in charge of controlling the spirit formation was already decided. It was Liangqiu Lanyue.

“Senior brother, we’re ready,” Liangqiu Lanyue spoke loudly.

“Buzz~~~”

Immediately, the enormous spirit formation floating in the sky began to move. Dazzling light started illuminating their surroundings, covering the entire Ancient Era’s remnant.

Being illuminated by the light, the defensive formation that covered the Ancient Era’s remnant was completely revealed. Furthermore, one could see with clarity that there was a crack in a certain location in that defensive formation.

The crack was being distorted and wiggling about in a manner akin to flowing water.

“Set up the formation!”

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Following a shout from Liangqiu Lanyue, the people of the younger generation all stood up, flew into that crack and began to set up their grand formation.

“So that’s the case.”

At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder exclaimed lightly at practically the same time.

They had realized why there was a need for so many people of the younger generation to be gathered.

Evidently, Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others had not wasted the days they had spent there. The crack in that grand defensive formation must’ve been created by that grand unsealing formation.

Merely, that crack should be the limit of what their grand unsealing formation could accomplish. It would be extremely difficult for them to continue with their attempts at breaching the defensive formation past that point.

The only way to continue would be to enter the crack and set up an unsealing formation to disintegrate and destroy the grand defensive formation from within.

However, it was clear that there was some sort of restriction present on that crack, making it so that Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others would not be able to enter. Only the people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age would be able to enter it.

That was the reason why even though Liangqiu Chengfeng, a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, was present, they would still require assistance from those younger generation members.

At that moment, Liangqiu Chengfeng and the other experts were all fully activating their grand unsealing formation.

As for the younger generations led by Liangqiu Lanyue, they had already finished setting up an unsealing formation within the crack.

At that moment, not only was dazzling light shining all over, but overwhelming spirit power had also pervaded the surroundings, causing even heaven and earth to tremble violently.

The defensive formation around the Ancient Era’s remnant was also trembling violently. It seemed like it was withstanding some sort of unbearable impact.

That sort of condition lasted for an entire hour. Then, the light began to dissipate, and the grand unsealing formation activated by Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others began to withdraw its power.

Following that, Liangqiu Lanyue and the other people of the younger generation also stopped the activation of their unsealing formation.

Merely, at that moment, everyone had a disappointed look on their face.

The reason for that was because even with how impressive and mighty their unsealing method was, they’d only managed to expand the size of the crack by a slight amount.

Evidently, they had failed in their breaching attempt.
