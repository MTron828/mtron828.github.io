Chapter 5844: Contrasting Emotions From Reunion With Old Friends

“Chu Feng,” a familiar voice echoed.

Chu Lingxi walked to the edge of the formation core and waved to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. Behind her were Shengguang Jin’an, Shengguang Xintian, Shengguang Menglai, Xia Yan, Kong Tianhui, and many other familiar faces.

These were people whom Chu Feng had once fought alongside or were old enemies but turned into friends. He waved back at them too.

“Are we safe now, Chu Feng?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“We’re safe now,” Chu Feng replied.

Chu Lingxi and the others finally stepped out of the protective formation and surrounded Chu Feng. It was not that they were timid, but they didn’t want to be a burden to him.

“Chu Feng, I heard that you participated in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, a place where the strongest juniors from the world of cultivation are gathered, and you were the champion there. The rumors should be true, right?” Shengguang Jin’an asked.

“Yes,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Amazing, my brother. You aren’t just the strongest junior of our Ancestral Martial Galaxy anymore but in the entire world of cultivation! You have brought honor to our Ancestral Martial Galaxy!” Kong Tianhui clenched his fists in excitement.

“Chu Feng, how strong are you right now?” Xia Yan looked at Chu Feng with expectant eyes.

She had made advancements since they last met, but the gap between her and Chu Feng was so huge that she couldn’t sense how strong he was. She could only tell that he was very strong.

“I’m only at Half-God level, but I have a True God level world spirit,” Chu Feng replied.

“True God?” The juniors were stumped.

Those at the outer perimeter of the formation core could see and hear Chu Feng’s words, and that induced a wave of excitement among them. The news quickly spread, and it didn’t take long for the billions of juniors gathered inside to learn that he had reached Half-God level and had a True God level world spirit.

“Wait, only Half-God level? You’re being too humble. It’s Half-God level, for heaven’s sake! That’s a level I’m devoting my life to!” Xia Yan sighed.

“You’ll reach it,” Chu Feng said.

“Don’t console me. I think I’m talented, but I’m still far from reaching Half-God.” Xia Yan pouted.

“That miss over there does have a long way to go, but I don’t think I’d ever reach it in my lifetime,” Kong Tianhui said.

“You’ll all reach it,” Chu Feng replied.

With a wave of his sleeves, he brought out several Cosmos Sacks and distributed them to those around him. These were the cultivation resources he had found in his Cosmos Sack that were suitable for his friends’ current cultivation.

His friends looked at the items in the Cosmos Sack, and their eyes lit up.

Kong Tianhui gasped and stared at Chu Feng in shock. “Is this... for us?”

They hadn’t thoroughly inspected what was inside the Cosmos Sack, but as cultivators, they knew that these would be extremely useful to them.

“I came back in a hurry, so I didn’t prepare much. I’ll bring back cultivation resources that are more suitable for you in the future,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, you’re too nice!”

Shengguang Xintian, Kong Ci, Long Ning, Xia Yan, and the others began tearing up. They were moved by his gesture. They understood how important cultivation resources were, and they could tell that the things Chu Feng had given them were worth a huge sum. Not even their clans had the means to provide these things for them.

Yet, Chu Feng gave it to them so casually. Even though they had ties with him, they were not that close as to be deserving of this.

Wuuu!

Kong Tianhui suddenly burst into tears.

“Why are you crying?” Chu Feng asked.

“Brother Chu Feng, I’m moved! I thought you were teasing us when you said that we could become Half-Gods too, but when you provided so many precious cultivation resources for us and promised to give us more in the future, somehow I feel like I see it. I think I might just be able to reach Half-God level. The one thing I did right in the world is to befriend you, Brother Chu Feng!” Kong Tianhui wiped off his tears and snot as he spoke.

“Enough, enough. We’re friends. There’s no need to fuss over this,” Chu Feng said. He turned to the others and asked, “Can anyone pass me a token to enter the formation core?”

“Here.” Xia Yan quickly passed a token over.

With the token in hand, Chu Feng waved his sleeves once more and distributed many more Cosmos Sacks. This time around, the Cosmos Sacks flew into the formation core and scattered all around. These were the gifts he had prepared for his other friends.

Some of his other friends didn’t approach him, possibly due to the limitations of their cultivation or their standing, but he could still clearly see them, such as Xia Yun’er, Li Yue’er, Li Anzhi, Wuma Shengjie, Gong Qing, and the others. He hadn’t forgotten about them, so he prepared gifts for them too.

“Junior Yun’er, what’s that?” Song Yunfei, who was standing beside Song Yun’er, saw one of the Cosmos Sacks in the sky falling into her hand, but he didn’t understand what was going on.

He was far away from Chu Feng, and his cultivation was relatively weak. He only learned bits and pieces of what was going on from the word spreading around. He had no idea what was going on at Chu Feng’s side, and he didn’t know the Cosmos Sacks came from Chu Feng too. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“It’s from young master Chu. It’s a gift from him,” Xia Yun’er replied.

The Cosmos Sack contained a sliver of information that seeped into her the moment she came into contact with her, and it informed her about what was going on.

“Chu Feng? Is it Lord Chu Feng’s gift? Junior Yun’er, can you let me take a look?” a disciple beside Xia Yun’er asked.

“Here.” Xia Yun’er passed the Cosmos Sack over.

“My gosh, he gave such valuable things to you just like that?” The disciple was stunned.

“Let me take a look too!”

The other disciples also peeked into the Cosmos Sack, and those who did so were astounded. Even the least valuable treasure inside there was worth more than the combined fortune of their Starfall Holy Land.

“Junior Yun’er, you have struck it rich this time!”

The disciples complemented Yun’er enviously while feeling bitter regret. They could have gotten close to Chu Feng back then, but they arrogantly looked down on him instead. Yet, the person whom they previously looked down on had become a behemoth far beyond their reach.

“Senior Song, do you regret going against Lord Chu Feng back then?” a woman suddenly asked with a teasing smile.

“Ha...” Song Yunfei replied with a bitter laugh.

He didn’t say a word, but the conflicted look on his face had already said everything.

“Forget it. It’s all over. Chu Feng won’t harp on it. He would have already done something by now if he wanted to,” Xia Yun’er said.

“That only makes me feel like I was a beast back then,” Song Yunfei said.

He had turned over a new leaf and wasn’t as arrogant as he was before, but Chu Feng remained a knot in his heart that he could never untangle.

Many people felt the same as Song Yunfei too, such as Gong Mingyue.

Gong Mingyue used to be betrothed to Chu Feng. Even if the two of them didn’t marry, they could have still become good friends if they had gotten along well. For instance, her younger sister, Gong Qing, still remained on good terms with Chu Feng despite the huge gap in their cultivation because she treated him well back then.

In contrast, she arrogantly thought that Chu Feng was trash and made things difficult for him. That had sealed their relationship. There was no way she could befriend him anymore. Seeing her little sister, Gong Qing, joyfully holding her Cosmos Sack filled her with regret and envy.

“Is that a gift from Chu Feng?” Gong Mingyue asked.

“How did you know, big sister?” Gong Qing had hidden the truth to not upset her big sister.

“It’s been some time now. I have already put it down. Can I take a look?” Gong Mingyue stretched her hand forth, but her hand was slightly trembling.

“Sure.” Gong Qing nodded and handed the Cosmos Sack over.

Gong Qing opened the Cosmos Sack, and she felt like a hammer had viciously struck her heart. Even breathing had become hard for her. She told herself that she had to hold back and not cry, but tears wouldn’t stop pouring from her eyes.

She had known that the items from Chu Feng would be invaluable, but she still struggled to come to terms with it when she saw them.

Despite her limited cultivation, she could tell how valuable the treasures inside the Cosmos Sack were. These were cultivation resources they would never attain even if their clan accrued hundreds of generations of wealth more.

She wanted such cultivation resources too, but it was a pity she was unqualified. She should have received a share of this invaluable gift too, but she ended up ruining it for herself.

Unfortunately, life was not as convenient as to allow them to do it over.

...

Chu Feng didn’t know that the gifts he had given out on a whim had evoked so many conflicted feelings among his old acquaintances. He looked at the Ancient Era’s prodigies before turning to Chu Lingxi and the others. “You should focus on channeling the formation core. I’ll deal with them first.”

“All right.” Chu Lingxi and the others returned to the formation core and continued channeling the formation core.

Chu Feng turned to Zhao Gongyi and asked, “Are you close with Huangfu Shengyu?”

“W-we aren’t close.” Zhao Gongyi hurriedly shook his head..

“Is he the strongest junior of the Ancient Era’s clans?” Chu Feng asked.

“He isn’t.”
