Chapter 5588: The Wang Clan’s Calamity

Chu Feng and Little Fishy had a pleasant chat on the way back. There was no lack of conversation topics between them. Their pleasant companionship made it feel like time was passing faster than usual.

Eggy, as if to grant Chu Feng and Little Fishy some privacy, had chosen to go to cultivate.

Finally, Chu Feng and Little Fishy arrived at Immortal River Upper Realm of the Heavenly Dome Galaxy’s Fighting Starfield. While Chaotic Era Scholar had neglected to label specific names, he was rather detailed with the other details such as the terrains.

However, when they finally arrived at the supposed location of the remnant, the two of them couldn’t help but wonder about the accuracy of the map.

It was a prosperous ancient city boasting the size of an Upper Realm.

The exact location of the remnant was the residence of a group of people known as the Wang Clan. The residence was massive, comparable to a city in the Lower Realm, making it apparent that the Wang Clan was a huge family.

It was just that the Wang Clan was already gone. The residence had been empty for centuries now. However, the other clans living in the vicinity were still around.

Chu Feng and Little Fishy didn’t immediately show themselves, instead choosing to assess the world beneath them from the sky. Little Fishy used her detection means, but she wasn’t able to find anything at all.

“Big brother, is it really here?” Little Fishy asked Chu Feng as she wondered if Chaotic Era Scholar had taken them for a ride.

“This is the place indicated on the map, but I can’t find anything special about it.” Chu Feng had been scanning the residence too, but he couldn’t find anything even through Heaven’s Eyes. He took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk and said, “Let’s try this.”

“Big brother, your horsetail whisk…” Little Fishy’s eyes lit up.

“You recognize it?” Chu Feng asked.

“It looks like the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk from the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect,” Little Fishy said.

“You actually recognize it!” Chu Feng was surprised.

He didn’t think that it was a good thing that Little Fishy recognized it, since it meant that other experts in the world of cultivation might recognize it too.

“Is it really the treasure of the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect? I only saw an imitation in my father’s treasure collection once.” Little Fishy’s eyes widened in astonishment.

“This should be the real deal,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Big brother, you sure are lucky to have obtained this treasure! You need to use it cautiously. While I doubt that most people will recognize it, there are still a few from the older generation who can recognize it. They might do you harm if they ever find out that you have this treasure in your possession,” Little Fishy reminded.

“I’ll take note of it,” Chu Feng said.

He tried to activate the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, but once again, it refused to provide him with any guidance.

“Does that treasure not work here too?” Little Fishy was taken aback.

Based on what she knew, the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk was a treasure for exploring remnants. It shone in times when world spiritists were struggling to figure out what was the next step of the way.

“It has a mind of its own. It’s formidable when it chooses to lend a helping hand, but more often than not, it refuses to help me,” Chu Feng said.

“It looks like it has quite an attitude.” That piqued Little Fishy’s interest. She gently stroked the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk with her fair hand and said, “Good horsetail whisk. Help my big brother, won’t you?”

Chu Feng chuckled at that sight. He figured that the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk was most likely to be an old monster by this point even if it possessed a sentience on its own; how could it be so easily coaxed like a child?

Weng!

Yet, the horsetail whisk actually reacted.

“Heaven! You’re incredible!” Chu Feng was startled.

He didn’t think that such a trick would actually work.

“Oh? Did it… really work?” Even Little Fishy was stunned as well.

“It did. Look,” Chu Feng said as he gestured toward the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

A blood aura flowed from the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk and drifted toward one of the ancient wells.

“I would have never thought that you were the perverted kind!” Chu Feng remarked as he followed the blood aura’s trail and descended into the ancient well. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had already examined the ancient well with his Heaven’s Eyes, but he didn’t notice anything special about it other than the fact that it was newer compared to the other buildings around it. Even when he entered the ancient well, he still struggled to find anything special about it.

The guidance from the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk only pointed him to the bottom of the ancient well too; there was nothing aside from that.

“The problem lies in this well,” Chu Feng said. “You stay hidden first. I’ll ask around.”

Chu Feng began approaching passers-by on the street to gather some information. Little Fishy tagged along too, but she remained hidden due to her sensitive identity.

They soon found out that the ancient city was constructed a long time ago, existing since the earlier years of the current era. The residence had switched hands many times, and the Wang Clan had only stayed there for three thousand years, which was a short time compared to the other clans in this ancient city.

The reason the Wang Clan had moved away and no one else was willing to move in was due to the Wang Clan’s young miss suddenly digging a well in her residence seven hundred years ago. The night the well was completed, she went insane.

She wasn’t the only one to suffer her fate. Shortly after, more and more Wang Clansmen went insane as well. Bizarre things started to happen as well. Some of the Wang Clansmen began to die in the most gruesome way ever.

In the end, the Wang Clan chose to move away.

There were rumors that the Wang Clan’s young miss had dug out something unclean from the well, riling up a malevolent force. Due to that, many of those living in the vicinity chose to move away out of fear of being implicated, though the neighbors quickly realized that they weren’t being affected and eventually moved back in.

However, the Wang Clan remained empty. No one dared to stay there.

“It looks like the problem really lies in that well. They must have dug something. Big brother, what do you think Chaotic Era Scholar left for you? I’m really curious.”

Little Fishy’s eyes lit up in excitement. She was even more intrigued about what Chaotic Era Scholar had left for Chu Feng after hearing the Wang Clan’s story.

“I guess so. Let’s ask the people in question directly.”

By then, Chu Feng had already learned that the Wang Clan was still residing in this Upper Realm, albeit a distance away. He quickly headed there with Little Fishy.
