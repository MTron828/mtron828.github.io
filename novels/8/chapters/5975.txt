Chapter 5976: Jie Tian’s Mother

This woman bore some resemblance to Jie Tianran and Chu Feng’s maternal grandmother, but she wasn’t Jie Ranqing. In particular, her features had striking similarities to Jie Tian.

“It looks like you have figured out who I am. I am indeed Jie Tian’s mother, as well as your mother’s big sister. If you don’t mind, you can call me aunt,” the woman verified her identity.

She was Jie Ranqing’s big sister, Jie Tiannian.

“Get to the point.”

Despite his blood ties to Jie Tiannian and the latter’s gentle gaze, Chu Feng maintained a wary attitude toward the latter, knowing that she was from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

However, Jie Tiannian wasn’t bothered by his attitude. She continued with the same gentle tone, “I’ll be taking those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion with me. I’ll say that I came here to save them, but you escaped with your means.

“As for the Totem Nine Daoists’ side, it’s best for us to align our stories lest it lead to complications. You can tell them that you fled because you didn’t trust me, but I have promised not to hurt you or divulge their involvement here so that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion won’t go after them.

“After you send the Totem Nine Daoists off, you can visit me here.”

Jie Tiannian opened up her palm, and a letter flew toward Chu Feng.

Chu Feng grabbed the letter, and a piece of information flowed into his mind. It indicated the location of a realm that was not too far away from here.

“It’s fine if you refuse my invitation too. I am aware of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s deeds. We are the ones at fault here, so I understand regardless of what you choose.”

With that, Jie Tiannian vanished into thin air. Jie Tian and the others left with her.

Weng!

The letter in Chu Feng’s grasp transformed into a Cosmos Sack.

Inside the Cosmos Sack was a colossal amount of world spiritist cultivation resources, and they had been refined so they could be immediately consumed. Their effectiveness was above that of the cultivation resources he had received from the Totem Nine Daoists.

This was an invaluable gift.

Aside from cultivation resources, the Cosmos Sack also contained a talisman paper emanating the Ancient Era’s aura. It was both a teleportation means and a protection means, and it would be automatically triggered if he was in danger.

It was far more formidable than the talisman paper he had received from the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s leader.

Chu Feng tried to wake up the Totem Nine Daoists. They were unharmed, but they were deeply asleep and were unlikely to wake up any time soon.

He thought about the means Jie Tiannian had displayed thus far; the latter was likely to be at pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist too, but she was a prodigy with means far surpassing that of Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon.

Even Chu Feng was unable to see through her means, including how she knocked out the Totem Nine Daoists.

She was able to bring out the true prowess of a pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist.

Chu Feng left the realm together with the unconscious Totem Nine Daoists.

Shortly after they arrived at another realm, the Totem Nine Daoists simultaneously awoke from their sleep.

Chu Feng told them about what happened earlier, but he weaved a lie and claimed that he had another escape means that he resorted to when he noticed that the situation had gone awry.

The Totem Nine Daoists didn’t doubt his words after seeing what he was capable of.

“Young hero Chu Feng, we’re indebted to you. I didn’t expect Jie Tianran would personally come after you,” Daoist First Dragon said.

“It wasn’t Jie Tianran but my aunt, Jie Tiannian,” Chu Feng replied.

“Jie Tiannian? She has already reached such a level?”

The Totem Nine Daoists looked conflicted. They were surprised, but Jie Tiannian was a renowned prodigy of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion before Jie Ranqing’s meteoric rise, so they could still accept such an outcome.

“Young hero Chu Feng, what did you just say?” Daoist Ninth Dragon suddenly stared at Chu Feng with widened eyes.

“The one who attacked us is Jie Tiannian,” Chu Feng replied.

“No, I mean what you said before that,” Daoist Ninth Dragon clarified.

The other daoists belatedly realized what Daoist Ninth Dragon was getting at, and they stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.

Chu Feng chuckled.

He also only just remembered that the Totem Nine Daoists had been trapped in the remnant for quite some time now, so they weren’t aware of the latest happenings in the world of cultivation. Thus, they still didn’t know that he was Jie Ranqing’s son, as well as his deeds.

“Jie Tiannian is my aunt because my mother is Jie Ranqing.”

“What? You’re Jie Ranqing’s son?!”

The Totem Nine Daoists were astounded. No one could have imagined seeing such huge reactions from the nine old men. This was beyond what they could accept in the spur of the moment.

Jie Ranqing was a legendary figure to them.

“I won’t lie about something like that,” Chu Feng added with a smile.

“Young hero Chu Feng, please don’t misunderstand. It’s not that we don’t believe you, but we need some time to digest something so shocking. Putting all things aside, you do resemble her. You’re Jie Ranqing’s son.”

“Chu Feng, I didn’t expect you to have such an identity, but it all makes sense. That explains your ridiculous talent. It turns out you’re Jie Ranqing’s son!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“But why is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion going after you if you’re Jie Ranqing’s son?”

The Totem Nine Daoists expressed their confusion.

“That’s because they don’t know my father,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle. He proceeded to explain what happened to them.

“Jie Tianran’s age must have caught up for him to not only reject such a talented grandson but even attempt to kill him.”

“Pride is a cardinal sin.”

The Totem Nine Daoists shook their heads. They couldn’t comprehend Jie Tianran’s decisions.

“Young hero Chu Feng, what do you plan to do? You can come with us if you have nothing up. We’ll ensure your safety,” Daoist Second Dragon said.

“Second brother, we would have been captured by Jie Tiannian if not for young hero Chu Feng. It’s more like young hero Chu Feng ensuring our safety instead,” Daoist Third Dragon said.

“That’s true.” Daoist Second Dragon smiled.

The other daoists laughed too.
