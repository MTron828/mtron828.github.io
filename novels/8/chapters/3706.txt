Chapter 3706 - Determination To Confront Death

“Damn it!”

Seeing that the situation had turned bad, Chu Feng also began to think of a way to help Gu Mingyuan.

Unfortunately, even though he was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he was still helpless against the situation.

Seeing Gu Mingyuan about to be sucked into that spirit formation gate, Chu Feng was burning with anxiety.

However, he was unable to move. He had to use all of his strength to seal off the spirit formation gate before him. If he didn’t, it would send out waves again.

The waves would push from all directions, and Gu Mingyuan was now also within range.

If things weren’t lucky, the wave might directly push Gu Mingyuan into that spirit formation gate emitting the aura of death.

Should that be the case, not only would Chu Feng bring forth harm upon Gu Mingyuan, but even he himself would be drawn into the spirit formation gate of death.

“Woosh~~~”

However, right at this moment of imminent peril, a figure suddenly entered the sea from above. That person directly arrived before the spirit formation gate emitting the suction power and stopped it.

Upon seeing that person, Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan both cried out ‘oh no’ in their hearts.

The two of them both recognize that person. It was Chu Lingxi’s father, Chu Xuanzhengfa.

That spirit formation gate was very dangerous. For Chu Xuanzhengfa to appear before it, he would undoubtedly be courting death.

“Why did you come down here? Wasn’t it said that you could not come in here with your cultivation?”

Seeing Chu Xuanzhengfa, Gu Mingyuan revealed a look of nervousness and worry.

This was the first time Chu Feng had seen such an expression on Gu Mingyuan’s face.

Gu Mingyuan had been reacting to Chu Xuanzhengfa with anger and disgust the entire time.

If he didn’t see it himself, Chu Feng would not have believed that Gu Mingyuan would worry for Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“I am Lingxi’s father. How could I watch passively from above while the two of you risked your lives?” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“But you...”

Gu Mingyuan wanted to say something. However, before she could finish, Chu Xuanzhengfa interrupted her, “Say no more. Mingyuan, seize this moment and retrieve the Deepsea Pupils. I... will not be able to last for long.”

Chu Xuanzhengfa was not joking around. At that moment, close to half of his body had been sucked into the spirit formation gate.

His veins bulged, and there was an expression of pain on his face.

Even though he had managed to block the spirit formation gate with his body, he did not appear to be able to last for long.

Seeing that, Gu Mingyuan did not dare to hesitate in the slightest. She immediately rushed towards the Deepsea Pupils again.

This time, she smoothly arrived before the Deepsea Pupils and managed to come into contact with them.

“Buzz~~~”

In an instant, blue light started shining brightly. In an instant, the blue light engulfed the entire sea.

At that moment, the sea became extremely beautiful. The violently surging undercurrents all stopped.

Unfortunately, the suction power of that spirit formation gate was still present. Furthermore, the spirit formation gate Chu Feng was tasked with sealing was also present.

Most importantly, even though Gu Mingyuan had managed to get ahold of the Deepsea Pupils, it was no easy task for her to retrieve them.

The two Deepsea Pupils seemed to be fixed in place. Even a martial cultivation expert like Gu Mingyuan was unable to move them.

“Eeeeahhh~~~”

Suddenly, Gu Mingyuan let out a loud shout, and released an enormous amount of power.

As the power she released was too powerful, it began to wreak havoc. Even the soil on the seabed started to burst apart.

That entire region of sea started to tremble violently. It seemed like the sea was boiling over.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. The sea started to quake violently. It seemed like the world was about the collapse.

However, that terror did not occur. Instead, the Deepsea Pupils entered Gu Mingyuan’s hands.

At that moment, Gu Mingyuan turned her gaze to Chu Xuanzhengfa.

Chu Xuanzhengfa had been completely sucked into the spirit formation gate. Only his hands were still tightly grabbing onto the spirit formation gate.

Neither Chu Feng or Gu Mingyuan were still able to see him. However, they were able to hear his voice.

“Mingyuan, take care of Lingxi,” Chu Xuanzhengfa’s voice sounded from the spirit formation gate.

Chu Feng was able to see that even though Gu Mingyuan had a look of hesitation, she knew her mission.

She clenched her teeth and then started rising, rushing toward the surface of the sea.

Only her voice was still resonating in the sea...

“Hold on a bit longer. I will come back to save you two immediately.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After Gu Mingyuan reached a safe area, Chu Feng’s body shifted, and he began to rush toward Chu Xuanzhengfa.

He couldn’t possibly watch and do nothing as Chu Xuanzhengfa died. He was determined to pull him out from that spirit formation gate.

“Wuuah~~~”

However, right after Chu Feng left, the spirit formation gate that he was sealing immediately released a powerful wave.

The wave pushed Chu Feng straight toward the spirit formation gate emitting the attractive force.

Chu Feng had guessed correctly. Sure enough, the spirit formation gate that emitted waves ended up pushing him toward the other spirit formation gate.

“Chu Feng, don’t come over!!!”

Chu Xuanzhengfa’s voice sounded again. After his voice was heard, his hands let go of the spirit formation gate.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was unable to withstand the powerful suction force, and had completely fallen into that spirit formation gate.

Hearing Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Feng felt extremely complicated.

Behind him was an enormously powerful wave pushing him forward. Even if he wanted to back out, he would not have the chance to do so.

That said, Chu Feng had no intention to back out. Since he had made the decision to save Chu Xuanzhengfa, he was naturally prepared for the possibility of death.

Thus, without cowering, Chu Feng rushed straight into the spirit formation gate that was emitting that enormous suction.

......

Meanwhile. Gu Mingyuan arrived above the Mirror Sea.

“Seniors, please take care of Lingxi for me.”

Gu Mingyuan handed the Deepsea Pupils to Grandmaster Liangqiu. Then, she took a glance at the still unconscious Chu Lingxi.

Love filled Gu Mingyuan’s eyes. At the same time, she felt very relaxed.

After obtaining the Deepsea Pupils, she was acting like she had completed her mission.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, she turned around and intended to dive back into the sea.

This time around, her eyes were filled with determination. It was the determination to face death.

However, before Gu Mingyuan could dive back into the sea, she was stopped by a hand. It was old man Zhu.

“This girl has already lost her father. Are you planning to have her lose her mother too?” he asked.

However, Gu Mingyuan did not hesitate. Her body shifted, and a big splash soared into the sky. She had dived back into the Mirror Sea.

Grandmaster Liangqiu realized that the situation was bad. Not knowing the truth, he turned to ask his friend, “Brother Zhu, you’re able to see the situation inside?”

“Could it be... Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa have met a bitter encounter?”
