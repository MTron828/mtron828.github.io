MGA: Chapter 943 - Chu Feng Appears

“Yeah! Why is Chu Feng left out? Even though You Tonghan is very powerful, he seems to be quite lacking when compared to Chu Feng!”

“Actually, I wanted to ask this question quite a while ago. On such an important day, why hasn’t Chu Feng appeared?” Old Liu’s words were like fuse as a ruckus exploded amongst the crowd. Many people started guessing the answer to that question.

“Heh, you must not know. I’ve heard that Chu Feng’s a coward who’s afraid of death! Because he fears the Immortal Execution Archipelago, he doesn’t want to be affected by the Crippling Night Demon Sect, so he’s already withdrawn!”

“What the hell are you talking about? I’ve personally seen Brother Chu Feng’s glory before. How does he even resemble a person who fears death or the Immortal Execution Archipelago?

“Besides, Chu Feng had eradicated a sect in the Winter Plains for our brothers! He even killed experts from the Immortal Execution Archipelago!”

“I’ve heard Chu Feng fought Murong Xun in the Gale Plains, and in addition to saving Xuan Xiaochao and the others, he even saved the Water King and Fire King! There are even many people who can act as witness to this!

“Chu Feng, as a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, was willing to risk his life. How could he possibly betray us because he’s scared of dying? If you ask me, there’s someone who’s jealous of Chu Feng’s abilities and intentionally forced him out!”

“Shh, you cannot say things like this! The Three Protectors intentionally nominated their own disciples to become sect head. Don’t you understand what they mean by that?”

“Don’t make such random conjectures! Why would the Three Protectors cast away Chu Feng? When the Immortal Execution Archipelago allied with the Three Great Monstrous Clans and attacked the Misty Peak, Chu Feng was there. He was heavily injured on that day, and right now, no one knows whether he is alive or not. If you ask me, he’s likely dead. That’s why he hasn’t shown up.”

“Ahh, has he truly died? That would be quite a pity. I truly do want to see Chu Feng’s glory! If Chu Feng stepped into that formation, he wouldn’t have been stopped at just the fifth layer, right?”

Everyone was talking about Chu Feng amidst their discussions. There were even many who felt Chu Feng was treated unfairly by lacking a chance and protested. Some felt Chu Feng left the Crippling Night Demon Sect.

There were also some who felt Chu Feng had died when the Immortal Execution Archipelago attacked the Misty Peak.

But regardless of their opposing thoughts, one could tell from their very words that they actually really hoped Chu Feng could become the sect head.

“I truly didn’t expect this brat Chu Feng to build up such fame within the Crippling Night Demon Sect during short two years.” Qiu Canfeng, who was standing amongst the crowd, smiled smugly at the praises directed towards his disciple. He couldn’t help feeling a bit proud.

“Everyone, shut up!” You Mingdeng suddenly shouted. His complexion was very, very distorted. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“All of you, listen up! It is unknown where Chu Feng comes from, and he holds an ulterior motive in his heart! Everything he’s done for the Crippling Night Demon Sect is for a scheme!

“Putting aside whether he is alive or dead, even if he comes, he cannot allowed to become sect head!

“Do not think my words are blatant lies! Earth King, you tell them! When you tried imprinting the Incomplete Moon Formation on Chu Feng, what exactly happened?!” You Mingdeng furiously said.

“This... Chu Feng’s body was special, and I had failed to imprint the formation on him,” the Earth King said.

“What? The formation couldn’t be imprinted on Chu Feng?”

“The Incomplete Moon Formation is the symbol of the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Without it, it means he hasn’t joined us!”

“Does it mean Chu Feng wasn’t a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect from the very beginning?”

Many people felt You Mingdeng’s words were reasonable. As a part of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, they all took pride in the Incomplete Moon Formation on their backs.

Similarly, it was the indication of their sect. So, they reasonably felt those without the formation weren’t from the Crippling Night Demon Sect.

“I know you have a rather deep friendship with Chu Feng, but as Big Brother Qiu Canfeng’s old subordinates, you best know your boundaries. If you dare to support that Chu Feng again, I may not be so polite,” You Mingdeng fiercely shouted as he pointed at Old Liu.

At first, he still wanted to say a few more things, but he was stopped by his brothers. In the end, after consideration of their current state, he remained silent.

“It’s not that I, You Mingdeng, am being selfish. This formation was laid together by me, Xue Xiyue, and Fu Liansheng. It is absolutely fair.

“And my disciple, You Tonghan, had walked the farthest within the formation. He was the nearest to the Demon Sealing Sword, so it should be he who becomes the substitute sect head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Is there anyone who wishes to raise objections?” You Mingdeng said again.

The initial rowdy crowd once again returned to peace. Not a single person said another word, nor were there any who dared to object.

You Mingdeng’s mouth couldn’t help but curl into a complacent smile. Then, he said, “Very well. Since there are no objections, I announce You Tonghan to be...”

“Wait!” But all of a sudden, before You Mingdeng was even able to finish speaking, a yell exploded within the crowd.

There was no one who wasn’t shocked when this shout erupted. The surrounding crowd quickly distanced themselves from the direction of the voice, afraid they would be dragged into whatever calamity that was about to occur.

Very soon, Chu Feng appeared in front of everyone.

“Who are you?” asked You Mingdeng with a bit of unhappiness. After he looked at Chu Feng, he frowned slightly. Chu Feng changed his appearance, so he didn’t know he was Chu Feng.

But daring to speak at such a crucial moment made You Mingdeng feel very displeased. This was a challenge to his power.

“This Crippling Night Demon Sect member heard the person who advances the most within the formation can become sect head. So, I want to give it a try. Can Lord Protector give me this chance?” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Who is this person? So many people have failed, yet he still wants to enter the formation! Does he truly think he is stronger than You Tonghan? He thinks too highly of himself.” A burst of ridicule instantly came from the crowd. They felt Chu Feng was looking to be humiliated.

Originally, You Mingdeng felt displeased at Chu Feng’s emergence, but after hearing everyone’s mocking, he once again made a strange smile.

He was the same as everyone else. He felt Chu Feng was making a fool of himself, and since Chu Feng wasn’t afraid of embarrassment, You Mingdeng was even less afraid. Thus, he decided to allow Chu Feng to disgrace himself completely.

“Of course you can. If you are a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s younger generation, you have the right to become sect head. Go ahead, but careful. The power of the formation is very powerful. If you are injured because of it, no one can help you,” You Mingdeng said with a smile. The meaning behind his words was very clear as well—he was telling all of them when this overconfident brat blasted away from the formation, no one was allowed to help him. He wanted this person to receive serious injuries, teaching him a lesson in that manner.
