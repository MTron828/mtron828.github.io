Chapter 4314 - A Long Path With A Heavy Responsibility

Xianhai Shaoyu had clearly declared in the past that there would not be anyone that could match his younger sister.

Yet now, he told Chu Feng to marry his younger sister?

To Xianhai Xin’er and Xianhai Gusu, the degree at which Xianhai Shaoyu acknowledged Chu Feng was no longer shocking. Instead, it was terrifying.

“Brother Shaoyu, please don’t mention this joke again.”

Chu Feng smiled and shook his head at Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Brother Chu Feng, I am serious. This is not a joke.”

“I think that you’re capable of matching my sister. Besides, my little sister had already fallen for you.”

“Sooner or later, the two of you will be together.”

“Unless...”

“You don’t like my sister?”

Xianhai Shaoyu suddenly narrowed his eyes.

Once he said those words, Xianhai Xin’er and Xianhai Gusu also looked to Chu Feng.

Not like Xianhai Yu’er?

How could such a man possibly exist in this world?

After all, even if one was to ignore her talent and status, merely her appearance was already something that no man could resist.

“Brother Shaoyu, you and I are brothers. I see Little Fishy just like how you see her.”

“I, like you, also consider her as a younger sister,” said Chu Feng. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“This...”

Xianhai Xin’er and Xianhai Gusu simply do not dare to believe their ears after hearing those words.

Chu Feng actually said he doesn’t possess any attraction for Xianhai Xin’er?

“If that’s the case, that silly little sister of mine is somewhat pitiful.”

“So it was only an unrequited love.”

“That said, I can also understand where brother Chu Feng is coming from. In your impression, my little sister was still only a child. It is very normal for one to not possess any feelings for a child. That I can understand.”

“But, my little sister is actually no longer the same as how she was in your memories.”

“Thus, you shouldn’t make a final conclusion just yet. It wouldn’t be too late for you to determine if you like her after meeting her again in the future,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

Not only was he not at all angry at Chu Feng’s attitude, he was instead very understanding.

Chu Feng didn’t know how to respond to him and ended up smiling helplessly.

“Brother Chu Feng, regardless of what your attitude toward my little sister might be, I, Xianhai Shaoyu, will forever be your brother.”

“Take this title plate. If you happen to come across our Immortal Sea Galaxy in the future, make sure to pay a visit to our Immortal Sea Fish Clan.”

As Xianhai Shaoyu spoke, he took out a title plate and handed it to Chu Feng.

From a single glance, one could tell that title plate was an extraordinary item.

It was constructed of very precious materials. A special spirit formation was contained in that title plate. With that spirit formation, no one will be able to forge a fake title plate.

The title plate possesses two sides. The front inscribed the characters ‘Immortal Sea Fish Clan.’

On the back inscribed the words ‘Friend of Xianhai Shaoyu.’

Without needing any explanation, Chu Feng knew what use and authority this title plate possessed.

“Young friend Chu Feng, that title plate was something that our clan’s clan chief personally ordered to be made for His Highness Shaoyu.”

“With that title plate in hand, one will not only be able to enjoy the treatment of a distinguished guest upon entering our Immortal Sea Fish Clan, one will also be able to dispatch our clan’s bodyguards.”

“Even our clan’s elders will salute and give their respect to the holder of that title plate.”

“Ten such title plates were made. But, His Highness Shaoyu had only given a single one so far. That is the one that you’re holding in your hand,” said Xianhai Gusu.

The only title plate?!

Even though Chu Feng already knew the weight this title plate carried, he realized that he had still underestimated its weight and authority after hearing Xianhai Gusu’s explanation.

“Brother Shaoyu, this gift is a bit too much, no?”

With the title plate in hand, Chu Feng felt that the weight of the title plate was simply too much for him to bear.

It was not a matter of what the title plate itself was. Rather, it was the fact that Xianhai Shaoyu gave such a precious title plate to him.

The weight of this friendship moved Chu Feng more than the authority of the title plate itself.

“Brother Chu Feng, you need not say that sort of thing. As brothers, there’s no need for us to speak like that.”

After Xianhai Shaoyu said those words, he clasped his fist at Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, let us meet again.”

“Yes, let us meet again,” Chu Feng returned a clasped fist.

Then, he bid his farewell to Xianhai Xin’er and Xianhai Gusu too.

After that, Chu Feng watched as Xianhai Shaoyu opened a spirit formation gate before him with a treasure.

The other side of the spirit formation gate was the boundless starry sky.

Xianhai Gusu, Xianhai Xin’er and Xianhai Shaoyu all entered the spirit formation gate to the starry sky. With that, the spirit formation gate closed.

Chu Feng doesn’t know how they were able to cross over the endless starry sky and countless worlds to return to the Immortal Sea Galaxy.

But, whatever method they might be using, it was most definitely going to be extraordinary.

After Xianhai Shaoyu and others left, Chu Feng felt very complicated.

He felt like a poor and low-class bumpkin that had suddenly befriended the young master of a wealthy family.

Furthermore, the two of them had determined an identical target!

While Xianhai Shaoyu was considering him as a brother, Chu Feng must recognize the disparity between them.

He knew that he would have to catch up to Xianhai Shaoyu and decrease the gap between them.

Else, how was he supposed to take on that inestimably powerful Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?

How was he supposed to rescue his mother?

“Chu Feng, you have a long path with a heavy responsibility ahead of you,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

At this moment, he was feeling pressure. But, this pressure made him excited.

This enormous pressure will inevitably become the motivational power to push him forward.

Besides, there was something worthy of rejoicing for him.

It was the harvest he obtained from helping Xianhai Shaoyu withstand that black case’s power.

The power that was capable of strengthening one’s bloodline had thoroughly entered Chu Feng’s body. It was currently fusing with Chu Feng’s bloodline.

Chu Feng could even faintly feel that he would be able to reach a breakthrough.

Perhaps once the power fuses completely, it will not only strengthen his bloodline, it will also provide Chu Feng the opportunity to increase his cultivation by a level.

While a single level of cultivation cannot amount to much, it will at least bring him a step closer toward the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

That was something that Chu Feng yearned for the most right now.
