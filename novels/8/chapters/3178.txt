Chapter 3178 - The Monster’s Request

As matters stood, everyone had realized that Bai Liluo simply hadn’t journeyed there to help the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan at all. Instead, she was there to help Chu Feng.

The Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan had been deceived by her. She had simply never placed them in her eyes the entire time.

The Dragon and Tiger Brothers also realized that they had been deceived from the very start.

Originally, they had thought that Bai Liluo ordered them to call their subsidiary powers to come so as to use the opportunity to demonstrate their might.

Never did they expect that they would end up demonstrating Chu Feng’s might instead.

Remembering all the things Bai Liluo had them do, the Dragon and Tiger Brothers started to gnash their teeth angrily.

That said, even though they felt very furious, they did not dare to say anything. After all, they had no ways to deal with Bai Liluo at all. In fact, at that moment, even their own safety was in jeopardy. Under such circumstances, they would naturally not dare to say anything.

“I’ve finished saying all that I needed to say. All of you, scram,” suddenly, Bai Liluo waved her hand.

The Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan and their subsidiary powers were already scared witless by Bai Liluo.

Once Bai Liluo said those words, those people reacted as if they had found an opportunity to escape from the tiger’s den. Without any hesitation, they immediately started fleeing.

Furthermore, they came to a realization that from that point on, they could make an enemy out of anyone in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Eastern Region. However, they absolutely could not make an enemy out of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Feng.

As for the reason why, it was because the monster Bai Liluo stood behind Chu Feng. Who would dare offend him?

What happened to the Burnfield Monstrous Clan on that day served as the best example of that.

In an instant, all of the powers gathered outside the Chu Heavenly Clan left.

Apart from the Mighty Dongguo Duo, only Bai Liluo and the tied up Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys were outside the city.

No, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were also there. However, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen had already lost their minds. They were forcibly tortured to a state of insanity by Bai Liluo.

“For people as shameless and useless as the three of you, this young lady truly wants to properly teach you all a lesson,” Bai Liluo cast her gaze to Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys.

“Lady Liluo, please spare us, please spare us,” Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys eyes were streaming with tears. The trousers of one of them had even turned wet. He had actually pissed his pants in terror.

Fear, how could they not be afraid? To personally witness the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen being tortured to a state of insanity by Bai Liluo, how could Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys not be afraid?

“However, regardless of whether or not you all want to admit it, you’re still members of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, it’s better for little brother Chu Feng to be the one to decide your life and death,” after Bai Liluo said those words, the crimson snake that bound Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys disappeared.

However, the three of them were not free. Instead, they began to float in midair uncontrollably. They floated toward Chu Feng.

Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately removed the grand defensive formation. Then, Chu Feng shot forth his palm explosively. The three men screamed at the same time as they were smashed away. Like dying dogs, they fell to the ground. After falling, they began to roll about repeatedly.

All three of them were injured by Chu Feng. Merely, it was only a minor injury.

Faced with those three traitors, Chu Feng did not attempt to kill them.

“What the three of you have done is your own decision. Although I truly want to punish you all, I feel that it’s better for your parents to be the ones to punish you.”

“Remember, from today on, you three are no longer members of our Chu Heavenly Clan. Scram.”

Chu Feng waved his hand.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys immediately turned around and began to flee. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the distant horizon.

“Little brother Chu Feng, you’re going to let them go just like that?”

At that moment, many people from the Chu Heavenly Clan flew onto the city wall and landed beside Chu Feng.

They were all confused as to why Chu Feng let Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys go.

Chu Feng did not answer the crowd’s questions.

However, he knew very well in his heart that it was simply impossible to kill Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys in this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. At the very most, he would be able to torture them insane.

Chu Feng felt that torturing them insane would be letting them off too easily.

Chu Feng wanted them to live, live until the day they left the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

At that time, they would be disdained by their clansmen. To them, that would be the actual punishment.

“Boy, what’s going on with you? Earlier, you were clearly filled with killing intent. Why would you decide to let the three of them go?”

Right at that moment, Bai Liluo walked over to Chu Feng with mischievous steps.

Seeing the incoming Bai Liluio, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen involuntarily moved behind Chu Feng.

Even though they knew that Bai Liluo had helped them, they were still unable to conceal the fear they had toward her.

“Miss Liluo, we truly never expected you to have such an extraordinary relationship with brother Chu Feng,” after Bai Liluo approached Chu Feng, the Mighty Dongguo Duo immediately went up to greet her with beaming smiles on their faces.

Like the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan also wanted to draw Bai Liluo in.

A monster like Bai Liluo was someone that all three of the Eastern Region’s strongest powers wanted to rope in.

The reason for that was because whoever managed to rope Bai Liluo into their camp would be equivalent to having dominated the entire Eastern Region.

Although the Mighty Dongguo Duo were also very confused as to how Chu Feng managed to become acquainted with Bai Liluo, it remained that they were standing in the same camp at that moment. As such, this could be considered to be a great opportunity to befriend Bai Liluo.

However, Bai Liluo completely ignored the smile-filled Mighty Dongguo Duo. She acted as if she did not see them, and directly walked over to Chu Feng.

This placed the Mighty Dongguo Duo in a very awkward situation. No matter what, they were renowned individuals in the Eastern Region.

However, even if they were placed in an awkward situation, what could they possibly do about it? In the end, they could only smile awkwardly, afraid to say anything.

The reason for that was because the person that had placed them in such an awkward situation was Bai Liluo.

At that moment, Bai Liluo’s body shifted, and she rapidly descended from the sky. She landed on the city wall before Chu Feng.

“Little girl, you’re truly one to not reveal your strength. I truly never expected you to be this strong.”

“It’s all thanks to you today,” Chu Feng said.

Even though Chu Feng would be able to protect the Chu Heavenly Clansmen with that invisible defensive formation even if Bai Liluo didn’t show up, Bai Liluo’s involvement created a deterrent effect.

As such, Chu Feng would naturally have to thank her.

“Don’t say those kinds of useless things. Big sister came to find you today because I have something that I wish to speak about with you. Are you free to talk with me in private?” Bai Liluo said to Chu Feng.

“I am.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Woosh~~~”

Right after Chu Feng said those words, he felt his surroundings turning fuzzy. Strong winds swept past him repeatedly.

When Chu Feng managed to regain his balance, he discovered that he was already far away from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s main city, and had landed on a mountain peak. Bai Liluo was standing before him.

Chu Feng looked to the little girl. His eyes were flickering with shock.

Chu Feng was unable to see through the little girl’s strength. However, Chu Feng guessed that the little girl was definitely stronger than rank two Martial Immortal.

Back then, when Chu Feng was saved in the cave, he had thought that he was saved because the little girl’s backing had arrived.

It was only now that Chu Feng realized that this little girl’s backing was actually herself.

“Big sister is not fond of beating around the bush. Thus, I will get right to the point.”

“I have one thing that I wish to seek your help with. If we are to succeed, I will be able to make progress with my cultivation.”

“Of course, big sister will not ask you to help me for free. As that place is a miraculous ground, should you accompany me there, while I don’t dare to guarantee that your cultivation will increase, it will definitely benefit your world spirit techniques greatly.”

“You should also know that the use of one’s world spirit techniques in this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is not at all inferior to that of one’s cultivation. In fact, one’s world spirit techniques will be even more useful than one’s cultivation,” Bai Liluo said to Chu Feng.

“What sort of place is it? How long are we going to be away for?” Chu Feng asked.

“I still cannot inform you of the place. I’m also uncertain as to how long we’ll be away. You merely need to tell me if you will accompany me there or not,” Bai Liluo puffed up her cheeks. It was quite cute. However, her attitude was very unyielding.

Faced with such a Bai Liluo, Chu Feng chuckled. Then, he said, “I’ll go.”
