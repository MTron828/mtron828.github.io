Chapter 4245 - Cheap Trick

“Shameless boasting. Do you really think that strong talent would means read you also possess great strength?”

“I will have you realize the disparity between you and I now.”

As Lu Jie spoke, boundless spirit power was released from his body. He was planning to have a head-on confrontation against Chu Feng using his spirit power.

Before Lu Jie could attack Chu Feng, Old Man Compliance spoke. “Since this is a match between world spiritists, you should utilize world spirit techniques to their fullest.”

“A match of pure battle power would be simply too dull.”

The meaning of his words was very clear. He did not wish to see a head-on confrontation between Lu Jie and Chu Feng. Instead, he wanted them to put effort and detail into setting up complete spirit formations for their showdown.

He did not want them to act like martial cultivators and fight by relying only on the battle power of their world spirit techniques.

After all, the longer a world spiritist spent setting up their spirit formation, the more powerful it would be. Normally, showdowns between world spiritists would take time. Only with that would the spirit formations they set up be powerful enough.

“What suggestion do you have in mind? Go ahead and speak it. I, Lu Jie, am willing to accept anything,” Lu Jie looked at Old Man Compliance with a faint smile.

He was already dissatisfied with Old Man Compliance’s behavior, and felt that he was siding with Chu Feng.

But, he didn’t really care about it as he had absolute confidence that he would be able to defeat Chu Feng.

Thus, no matter what suggestions Old Man Compliance might raise, he didn’t care.

Lu Jie not only wanted to utterly defeat Chu Feng, he also wanted to make everyone present realize that he, Lu Jie, was superior to Chu Feng.

He wanted to make them realize that he, Lu Jie, was still the fully-deserving strongest world spiritist of the Holy Light Galaxy’s younger generation.

Not only was he the strongest in the past, he was still the strongest at that moment, and would remain the strongest in the future.

“Young friend Chu Feng, do you have any objections to this old man setting the rules?”

Old Man Compliance did not directly set the rules. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng.

“I’m fine with anything. Since Lu Jie is willing to accept it, I have no objections either. Senior, please go ahead and set the rules.”

Compared to Lu Jie, Chu Feng was much more respectful.

“Truth is, the outcome of this match has nothing to do with this old man.”

“But, with all these world spiritists present, I believe that this old man is not the only one that wishes for the two of you to put forth a feast of a display of world spirit techniques.”

Once Old Man Compliance said those words, many people nodded in approval. Some even spoke directly to support him.

The crowd all wished to witness an exceptionally brilliant showdown between two genius world spiritists.

“How about this. The two of you can have a simple showdown between offensive and defensive formations.”

“The time to set up a spirit formation will be an incense stick’s worth.”

“What say the two of you?” asked Old Man Compliance.

“It’s fine with me,” said Chu Feng.

“Not an issue with me either,” said Lu Jie.

“Since that’s the case, the two of you can draw lots to determine who will attack first.”

As Old Man Compliance finished saying those words, Chu Feng suddenly said, “There’s no need for that, he can attack first.”

“What? What makes you think I need you to yield to me?” Lu Jie raised his brows and looked at Chu Feng. He was displeased by Chu Feng yielding to him.

“I’m not yielding to you. Since both you and I will have a chance to attack and a chance to defend, the outcome of the match will be decided by our spirit formations.”

“Thus, there’s no need to waste time. Let’s begin now,” As Chu Feng spoke, he sat down cross-legged and began setting up his spirit formation.

“Humph.”

Lu Jie, although displeased, did not hesitate and also began setting up his spirit formation.

“Amazing. As expected, the two of them are setting up their spirit formations completely unlike what people of the younger generation should be capable of.”

The people of the younger generation present were simply unable to make sense of the way Chu Feng and Lu Jie were setting up their spirit formations. As for the people of the older generation, they exclaimed in admiration repeatedly.

Chu Feng and Lu Jie’s grasp of world spirit techniques had surpassed the other people of the younger generation. Even for world spiritists who had trained for thousands of years, such mastery of world spirit techniques was still impossible for most.

Only grandmaster world spiritists that had been renowned for many years were capable of what they were doing.

But, Lu Jie was only several hundred years old. Chu Feng, on the other hand, was even more terrifying. He was not even a hundred years old.

As time passed, Chu Feng and Lu Jie’s spirit formations gradually took shape.

The spirit formation that Chu Feng had set up was a simple protective formation.

That protective formation was semi-transparent. Like a giant semi-transparent bowl, it covered Chu Feng within it.

Whilst Chu Feng’s spirit formation wasn’t gorgeous at all, the aura it emitted could be felt by all the world spiritists present.

It was an extremely powerful spirit formation.

Ignoring all else, Chu Feng’s current battle power was on par with rank two Utmost Exalteds.

But, the protective formation that Chu Feng had set up was something that not even rank two Utmost Exalted-level cultivators would be able to breach. That was the amazing aspect regarding Chu Feng’s protective formation, and the power of world spiritists.

In a normal confrontation and with the same battle power, a world spiritist’s world spirit techniques might not be able to take on a martial cultivator’s martial skills and secret skills.

But, if a world spiritist was given sufficient time to finish setting up a spirit formation, the martial cultivator would be the one to suffer losses should they fight.

That was the world spiritists’ advantage.

Even though the protective formation that Chu Feng had set up was very powerful, the crowd still didn’t believe that he would achieve certain victory.

The reason for that was because Lu Jie’s slaughtering formation was no small matter either.

In fact, the might of Lu Jie’s spirit formation surpassed Chu Feng’s protective formation by a lot.

The slaughtering formation that Lu Jie had set up was a golden spear. The golden spear measured a thousand meters in length, and had lightning surging around it.

Floating in midair, the spear caused the clouds to change color, and gave rise to howling winds.

Although it was a spear, the storm that it created made it resemble an enormous creature that had accumulated great power, enough to unleash devastation upon a region.

“Time’s up.”

Finally, an incense stick’s worth of time had arrived.

Once the time arrived, Lu Jie began rapidly forming hand seals. The golden spear floating in midair started to tremble violently.

As it trembled, the spear began to transform. Soon, it turned into ten spears.

“Boom---”

As the sky rumbled, the ten spears rushed forward to besiege Chu Feng simultaneously.

“Bang---”

“Bang---”

“Bang---”

Rumbles sounded as energy ripples surged forth.

The ten spears streaked across the sky and landed on Chu Feng’s protective formation from different directions.

But, even though the ten spears all struck Chu Feng’s protective formation, the protective formation merely trembled slightly. Not even a crack had appeared on it. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Chu Feng’s protective formation had easily blocked Lu Jie’s attack.

But, Lu Jie did not panic after seeing this. His hand seals changed again.

The ten spears started spinning.

“Zzzzz---”

Sparks soared into the sky as ear-piercing rumbling engulfed the surroundings.

Most importantly, as the ten spears began to rotate at the same time, the ten golden spears that were unable to pierce through the protective formation began to gradually bore their way into the protective formation.

“What a powerful slaughtering formation.”

“If this is to continue, Chu Feng’s protective formation will most definitely be breached.”

Seeing the situation before them, many people began to gasp with admiration at Lu Jie’s prowess.

Even though Chu Feng’s protective formation had not yet been breached, even though the speed at which the ten golden spears were boring into Chu Feng’s protective formation was very slow, the golden spears were making progress into Chu Feng’s protective formation as time passed. It was only a matter of time before Chu Feng’s protective formation was breached by the golden spears.

But, just when everyone felt that Chu Feng would definitely lose, he revealed a faint smile. Then... he formed a different hand seal and shouted softly, “Break!”

Once he spoke, his protective formation started trembling. Then, a body of light appeared at the center of the protective formation. The body of light turned into ten giant hands that extended outward. They actually each grabbed one of the ten spears.

Seeing that, the eyes of many bystanders shone. They felt that perhaps Chu Feng could still turn things around. But, soon, the light in the crowd’s eyes grew dim.

Many people even shook their heads in disappointment. Some even sighed.

“In the end, it’s Lu Jie of all people. Sure enough, Chu Feng couldn’t match his world spirit techniques.”

“Although what Chu Feng was capable of within the same battle power is already exceptional, it remains that there’s quite a disparity between him and Lu Jie.”

There was a reason for such comments.

Even though the ten giant hands that had been created by Chu Feng’s spirit formation had grabbed the ten golden spears, they were unable to stop them.

Instead, lightning surged from the ten spears as they spun. As the hands grabbed the spears, the friction of the lightning caused the hands to radiate energy ripples outwards. It seemed like those ten giant hands would crumble before the might of the lightning at any moment.

Those ten giant hands of light were simply no match for the ten spears.

“How could your cheap trick possibly take on my Flash-lightning Golden Spear Formation?”

Ridicule filled Lu Jie’s eyes as he looked at Chu Feng.

“Cheap trick?”

Chu Feng’s expression changed upon hearing those words. Then, a look of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes. He abruptly clasped his hands and shouted loudly, “Break!”

WIth those words, the ten giant hands also clenched tight like Chu Feng’s palm.

“Bang---”

“Bang---”

“Bang---”

“Bang---”

......

In the following instant, the ten golden spears were crushed.

“This!”

The crowd’s expressions all changed upon seeing this.

As for Lu Jie, he had a look of utter disbelief on his face.

His grand slaughtering formation was capable of both offense and defense. Yet, it had been so easily crushed by his opponent’s spirit formation?

When Lu Jie was in complete shock, a voice brought him back to reality.

“What were you calling a cheap trick again?”

Naturally, it was Chu Feng.
