Chapter 2787 - Searching For Another Method

“Chu Feng, our Yuwen City and you cannot exist together!!!”

“We will definitely settle this debt of blood with blood!!!”

Suddenly, the Yuwen City’s elders shouted with overflowing killing intent.

At that moment, everyone realized that the Yuwen City elders were not joking around. After all, Yuwen Tingyi was their Yuwen City’s Young City Master, a person with a very special status.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had no idea what was happening outside.

After the people from the Immortal Armament Villa left, Chu Feng did not rush to leave immediately. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the ground and began to ponder.

“If you attempt to find more flying insects now, it will likely be too late. Chu Feng, what do you have in mind now?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“Indeed, it’ll be too late. The amount of flying insects is finite. I already captured the great majority of them. Even if I am to try to capture them again, I would not be able to gather a sufficient amount. Otherwise, Xia Yun’er would not have needed the flying insects I captured,” Chu Feng said.

“In that case, do you think you still have a chance?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“I can’t be certain. Merely, I am unwilling to give up just like this. Perhaps... there is another method.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out all of the purple gemstones he had obtained so far and placed them on the ground.

Chu Feng stared at the gemstones and surveyed them for a very long time. However, he was still unable to find anything in particular regarding them.

Seeing that the one day time limit was soon to arrive, seeing that Buried Spirit Lake was soon to erupt, Chu Feng grew more and more impatient.

Suddenly, Chu Feng stood up and extended his palm. A blade formed by spirit power extended from Chu Feng’s palm.

Then, Chu Feng waved the spirit formation blade and sliced it at the gemstones on the ground.

“Woosh, woosh~~~”

As the blade moved back and forth, the purple gemstones started to swirl in the air. Those gemstones were being sliced into pieces by Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing?”

“Don’t be this stirred up by your emotions. Didn’t you say that there would definitely be other opportunities in this Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, that even if you miss this opportunity, there will be another one?”

Seeing Chu Feng slicing the gemstones, Her Lady Queen thought that Chu Feng was acting out of helplessness and venting his feelings onto the gemstones. Fearing that Chu Feng might lose himself, she quickly urged him to stop.

“Haha...” Hearing Her Lady Queen persuading him, Chu Feng immediately stopped, and even laughed.

Hearing Chu Feng’s laughter, a confused expression emerged in Her Lady Queen’s beautiful eyes.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s laughter did not resemble the laughter of someone driven by anger and impatience. Rather, his laughter was very relaxed.

“Eggy, you don’t have to worry. I am not venting myself on these gemstones. I am merely attempting something very stupid,” Chu Feng said.

“Something very stupid? What sort of thing is that? Let this Queen hear about it,” Her Lady Queen said.

“When a sufficient amount of flying insects are gathered, they will turn into a compass leading to Buried Spirit Lake.”

“I think that if one is to gather a sufficient amount of these gemstones, then perhaps they will also be able to guide me to Buried Spirit Lake,” Chu Feng said.

“Haha, this Queen understands now. Due to the fact that the amount of purple trees are limited, it would be impossible for you to gather a sufficient amount of complete gemstones. Thus, you planned to cut these gemstones into pieces to reach the required amount,” Her Lady Queen said with a laugh.

The reason why she laughed was because it was as Chu Feng had said, this was a foolish method. However, she felt that Chu Feng’s method was feasible.

Actually, Her Lady Queen was feeling admiration for Chu Feng. At the very least, Chu Feng had managed to think of a way in this helpless situation.

“Milady Queen, it seems that you also feel that this method of mine is feasible, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Feasible, of course it’s feasible. Go on and continue with it,” Her Lady Queen said.

“I’ll continue on then,” As Chu Feng spoke, he once again began to brandish his spirit formation blade.

As Chu Feng was cutting the gemstones with a spirit formation blade, those gemstones would only be sliced into smaller pieces and not destroyed when they encountered the spirit formation blade.

Chu Feng was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he sliced the gemstones into the required amount.

“Buzz~~~”

A shocking scene occurred. When the gemstones were sliced into enough pieces, they actually started to shine brightly. The next moment, they started to fuse with one another.

In the blink of an eye, the gemstones also turned into a compass.

“Heavens! Chu Feng, you’ve succeeded! That method of yours was actually feasible!” Her Lady Queen shouted in astonishment upon seeing this scene.

Chu Feng was actually also extremely astonished. He had truly never expected his foolish method to actually end up working.

Chu Feng picked the compass up and inspected it carefully. He discovered that the appearance of that compass was different from the compass formed by the flying insects. However, it was pointing in the same direction. This meant that the compass was indeed capable of guiding Chu Feng to Buried Spirit Lake.

“I wonder, what sort of reaction that poisonous woman Xia Yun’er will have when she sees me in Buried Spirit Lake?” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Who cares what sort of reaction she will have? After all, there won’t be anyone else in Buried Spirit Lake. If you are to encounter her, just strip off all her clothes and then take away her first time. You can consider that revenge for Li Xiang,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Woah! Milady Queen, you’re also a woman; how could you think of such a malicious thing to do?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile on his face.

“It is precisely because I am a woman that I know how painful it will be should a woman’s first time be forcibly taken away by someone.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“This is especially true for a woman like Xia Yun’er. With how vicious yet conceited she is, she will definitely view her first time with great importance.”

“Thus, if you are to take away her first time, it would be even more painful for her than having her cultivation crippled,” Her Lady Queen said with a mischievous smile.

“It’s better to forget about it. Back then, I was young and did that sort of thing to Yan Ruyu and the others. Because of that, I felt guilty and ashamed the entire time. I do not wish to make that sort of mistake again,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re still unable to let go of the three of them? It’s alright, this Queen has a feeling that the three of them are fine. Perhaps you will meet them again very soon.”

“Not only them, but Su Rou and Su Mei are also most definitely going to be fine too,” Her Lady Queen said.

“I will take Milady Queen’s lucky words,” Chu Feng smiled. Then, holding the compass in hand, Chu Feng began to proceed toward the direction indicated by the compass.

Chu Feng noticed that the direction indicated by the compass was changing nonstop. It simply seemed like it was pointing at random.

However, it was also precisely because the compass was changing directions nonstop that Chu Feng felt that it was useful.

After all, this seemingly normal mountain was actually a complicated maze. All kinds of bewilderment formations were present all over the mountain. If one was to follow one’s logic, one would definitely not be able to leave the mountain.

Meanwhile, as Chu Feng left in the direction indicated by the compass, two figures emerged from the void at the location where Chu Feng had sliced the purple gemstones to smaller pieces.

Those two people were actually the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief and the elder that had helped Chu Feng deliberately make things difficult for Han Yu earlier.
