Chapter 5353: Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists

Chapter 5353: Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists

“Big brother Chu Feng, I am very curious to know why those four daoists are helping you. Are you on close terms with them?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“We met at a remnant. I probably left a good impression on them,” Chu Feng replied.

“Is that all?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Mmhm,” Chu Feng replied.

“Well, they must have noticed your potential and know that you will become someone great in the near future. The Totem Nine Daoists I know of aren’t that kind,” Bai Yunqing said.

The Totem Nine Daoists usually kept to themselves, which was why Bai Yunqing couldn’t understand why the four daoists had stood up for Chu Feng. The only plausible reason he could think of was that the Totem Nine Daoists had been won over by Chu Feng’s potential. 

After all, Bai Yunqing himself had witnessed what Chu Feng was capable of, and he thought that it was more than enough to move a powerhouse. 

“Big brother Chu Feng, why is the Pill Dao Immortal Sect after you? Are you on bad terms with them?” Bai Yunqing asked.

Even though Chu Feng had offended Jia Chengying back in the Ancient Realm, that was unlikely to be the cause of this attack as Jia Chengying didn’t know that Chu Feng was alive. This meant that the mastermind must have been someone else in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. 

“Do you know Jia Lingyi?” Chu Feng asked.

“Jia Lingyi? Are you referring to the youngest daughter of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s sectmaster? She’s a prodigy who stunned the Totem Galaxy with her talents back then, which reinforced her position as the successor to the sect. Big brother Chu Feng, why are you mentioning her all of a sudden?” Bai Yunqing asked.

Realization struck him right after he said those words. He added, “It can’t be that you have offended her?”

“It’s not that I have offended her. She’s the one who has offended me,” Chu Feng replied.

“Big brother Chu Feng, it’s one thing to become enemies with Jia Chengying, but Jia Lingyi is not someone to be trifled with! She wields a lot of authority in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect,” Bai Yunqing said. 

“I have to kill her. I’ll kill anyone who tries to protect her,” Chu Feng replied with a calm voice.

“It looks like you harbor an irreconcilable grudge against her. Since that’s the case… let’s do it then. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect might be a big deal now, but it’s a matter of time before we trample them under our feet. Big brother Chu Feng, I’m with you on this!” Bai Yunqing said.

“Good brother!”

Chu Feng was delighted to have Bai Yunqing’s support. He knew that most people would have shunned him for going against the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, especially given how weak he was at the moment. 

Yet, Bai Yunqing was willing to support him, and Chu Feng could sense that those weren’t just empty words. He would have never imagined Bai Yunqing to be such a loyal friend, especially given the horrible first impression he had of the latter. 

“Big brother Chu Feng, should we disguise ourselves?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“You go ahead. I can’t put on a disguise due to certain reasons,” Chu Feng replied.

“Since big brother Chu Feng isn’t going to put on a disguise, I shan’t do it either,” Bai Yunqing replied with a smile.

… 

The four daoists found themselves in the middle of space after stepping out of the teleportation passageway, but they quickly made their way to the closest realm. They were going to enter an ancient teleportation formation, just that the destination would be different this time around.

Before stepping into the teleportation formation, Daoist Sixth Dragon took out a scroll that harnessed immense spirit power. Written on the scroll were the words: Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists.

“Six Brother, you!!!”

Daoist Seventh Dragon, Daoist Eighth Dragon, and Daoist Ninth Dragon were stunned.

“Since we might not survive this ordeal, we might as well do Chu Feng a favor. I feel a little guilt-ridden for leaving him in the lurch back at the Ancient Realm,” Daoist Sixth Dragon said.

“I agree with Sixth Brother’s decision. Chu Feng is a person with incredible luck and talent, evident by how he was able to escape the Ancient Realm alive. There’s bound to be a place for him in God’s Era. The nine of us have never befriended outsiders, but I think that we can at least accrue some good karma with him,” Daoist Seventh Dragon said.

“Seventh Brother is right. I agree as well.”

“Me too.”

Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon chirped in.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll be using the scroll now. I trust that our older brothers will understand the rationale of our actions. Speaking of which, this is the second time we’re using the Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists. It has been a long time since the last time,” Daoist Sixth Dragon said. 

“Even more reason for us to use it. The chances are slim that we’ll survive this ordeal. I’d like to see our Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists covering the entire Totem Galaxy for one last time,” the other three daoists said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“All right,” Daoist Sixth Dragon replied.

He unfurled the scroll and took out a special brush. He channeled his spirit power into the brush, and an extremely powerful formation began to surface. He proceeded to write a few huge words on the scroll.

Chu Feng is a friend of the Totem Nine Daoists. Anyone who dares to touch him will be the mortal enemy of the Totem Nine Daoists. 

After writing his message, Daoist Sixth Dragon kept the brush and fused his spirit power into the scroll. The scroll glowed brightly before abruptly vanishing.

The four daoists raised their heads to look at the sky.

Around five minutes later, there was a burst of brilliant light, and massive words began coming into appearance. Practically everyone in the Totem Galaxy could see those words clearly.

“What’s that? Is that a means of the Totem Nine Daoists?”

People from all over the Totem Galaxy were taken aback by the words that had suddenly appeared in the night sky. They could tell that those words were conjured by a stupendously powerful formation, but hardly anyone understood what they meant.

“It’s the Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists. The Totem Nine Daoists actually used it?”

There were also those from the older generation who recognized the means. Grim looks could be seen on their faces, for they understood what the Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists meant.

The last time it was used was when the Totem Nine Daoists fought against another powerhouse in the Totem Galaxy. That fight ended with the extinction of the powerhouse, and it was then that the Totem Nine Daoists first grew to prominence. 

In fact, that was how they won the favor of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, compelling the latter to extend an invitation to them.

The Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists was finally used once more after so many years, but it was all for Chu Feng’s sake. This showed just how important Chu Feng was to them.

Some people who were unnerved by that declaration, such as the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s Jia Chengying and Jia Chengxiong. 

“The Totem Nine Daoists are going to protect Chu Feng? He actually has their backing? But isn’t Chu Feng already dead?”

Jia Chengying and Jia Chengxiong both thought that Chu Feng had already died in the Ancient Realm. It was beyond their imagination how the latter could still be alive.

In a beautiful palace located in the depths of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, a woman raised her head to look at the sky. She had a young appearance, but her transcendental disposition and the vicissitudes in her eyes reflected her age. There was a conflicted look on her face when she saw those words.

“He actually got the backing of the Totem Nine Daoists. Song Luoyi, your grandson isn’t a complete pushover after all,” the woman muttered.
