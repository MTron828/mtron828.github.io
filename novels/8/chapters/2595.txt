Chapter 2595 - Rescue Chu Feng

At this moment, there were a lot of people standing in the sky.

Not only were all of the True Immortal-level experts from Hero City all here, but there were also many Martial Ancestor-level experts.

From the people standing in the sky, merely those from Hero City already numbered tens of thousands.

The reason why that was the case was because there were more than only people from Hero City there. There were also people from other powers.

Not to mention those tier two powers that had allied themselves with Hero City, but even the Immortal Sword School and Buddha’s Heavenly Temple had send forth a great amount of experts.

Their numbers were truly great.

From this, one could image how magnificent of a sight it was to have all these people standing in the sky.

“Why would there be this many people? Exactly what is going on?”

Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua looked to one another. Confusion covered their faces.

If Ying Mingchao was planning to save Chu Feng, he shouldn’t be bringing all these people.

However, if Ying Mingchao wanted to take care of them after finding out that they were here, there was even less of a reason for him to bring this many people.

At this moment, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua were completely puzzled.

“This is strange,”

After surveying the crowd, Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian’s expressions changed once again.

They grew even more puzzled.

The amount of people gathered in the sky was truly a majestic sight. All those that should have come and all those that should not have come all came. However, a single person did not come.

The person that was supposed to come here the most, Ying Mingchao, was not here.

Right at this moment, an old man stood forth and descended from the sky. He arrived at the central region of the Unknown Burial Ground.

That old monk was no ordinary individual. He was an Utmost Exalted Elder from the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple. Not only was he a True Immortal, but he was also a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Woosh, woosh~~~”

After that old monk descended to the ground, the people that were originally standing in the sky in an orderly fashion all started to descend to the ground.

There were people of all cultivations. There were both True Immortals and Martial Ancestors. However, they possessed a single common ground -- they were all world spiritists.

In an orderly manner, these people began to set up spirit formations to form a joint grand formation.

They seemed to have already planned this. Led by the Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, they began to divide up the work orderly as they set up their formations.

Apart from this, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua also felt some ill-intended gazes. Those were from Hero City’s older subordinates.

In fact, those sorts of gazes of hatred, gazes filled with killing intent, were being cast toward them from even True Immortal-level experts.

The two of them were capable of understanding this sort of situation. From their point of view, it was Ying Mingchao who was in the wrong to completely eradicate their clan.

However, when looking at things from the viewpoint of the people from Hero City, they would feel that the Kong Heavenly Clan was in the wrong for how they and the Zhou Heavenly Clan treated Ying Mingchao and Hero City back then.

As they were enemies, it was natural for the people from Hero City to hate the two of them.

However, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua were confused. Although those people were revealing their hatred toward them, they did not seem to plan to attack them.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, a figure descended from the sky and arrived beside Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua.

Although this person was wearing a black gown, a hood and possessed the cultivation of a rank one True Immortal, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua did not grow alert in the slightest from his approach. The reason for that was because they knew... that this man was that mysterious individual.

“Exactly what is going on?” Kong Shunlian asked.

“The current Hero City is much more lively than I imagined it to be. These people were all at Hero City. After finding out about this matter, they were asked by Ying Mingchao to come help.”

“Right now, there is a good news. That is, Ying Mingchao knows how to help Chu Feng.”

“Merely, he needs the assistance of an individual. As such, he has gone to find that person,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“Apart from that, Ying Mingchao knows that the two of you are here. He has already informed the people from Hero City beforehand. Thus, they will not attack you all. As such, you all can continue to stay here at ease.”

“Actually, Ying Mingchao was very regretful for what happened back then. According to what he said, he did such a ruthless thing because he was overwhelmed by anger, and has been tormented by his actions from that day.”

“I can tell that he wants to reconcile with you all. What do you plan to do?” The guardian clan’s clan chief continued.

Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua looked to one another. Neither said anything.

That said, the guardian clan’s clan chief saw wavering in their gazes. Likely, they too had thought about reconciling with Ying Mingchao.

That was understandable. With the situation at hand, it would be favorable for them if they could reconcile.

“How long will Ying Mingchao be gone for?” Kong Yuehua asked.

“I’m not certain about that either. However, he grew very impatient upon finding out that Chu Feng was in trouble. Else, he would not have mustered such a great number of people,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“That’s true,” Kong Shunlian agreed.

With all these people coming here, even if there were still people guarding Hero City, it would not be much different from an empty city.

After all, for a major power, their pillars were their True Immortals. Looking at the situation at hand, it seemed that Ying Mingchao had dispatched all of his True Immortals here.

It was not only their Hero City’s True Immortals; even their allies’ True Immortals had been dispatched here.

With this, one could see how much Ying Mingchao valued Chu Feng.

“Merely, will we be able to make it in time?” Kong Yuehua asked.

“Ying Mingchao saw my crystal, and inquired about the situation after seeing it. He said there should be enough time.”

“He said that Chu Feng should have entered a place called the ‘Gates of Hell.’”

“That ‘Gates of Hell’ is very long, and will become more and more difficult the further one proceeds. It will take Chu Feng some time to pass through that place.”

“However, fortunately, one will not really suffer any fatal danger from the Gates of Hell. Thus, he said that there will be enough time,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“How did he know that there’s a ‘Gates of Hell’ in the Unknown Burial Ground? Could it be....?” At this moment, Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian’s expressions both changed. They thought of a possibility.

“Ying Mingchao entered it before. Furthermore, he managed to come out alive,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“Siii~~~”

Hearing those words, both Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

Ying Mingchao had actually managed to come out of the Unknown Burial Ground that no one was able to come out of alive. This was truly hard to believe.

However, although they were astonished by it, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua immediately revealed joyous expressions afterwards.

As Ying Mingchao had been to it before, this meant that he most definitely knew the Unknown Burial Ground very well. As such, there would be hope in saving Chu Feng.

“Right now, the crowd is setting up that grand formation to rescue Chu Feng. Merely... another person is required in order to successfully set up that grand formation. The person that Ying Mingchao has gone to find is precisely that person,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“This is great, Chu Feng will be saved.”

“It seems that your decision to seek Ying Mingchao was the right one.”

At this moment, both Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua were extremely overjoyed.

Seeing the two of them acting in this manner, the guardian clan’s clan chief revealed a change in expression.

It was only at this moment that he discovered that these two people that should be Chu Feng’s enemies were actually this concerned about Chu Feng.

Most importantly, their reactions didn’t seem to be a pretense. Instead, they were deeply concerned for Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts.

“Since they’re all helping to save Chu Feng, we cannot watch with folded arms. Can you obtain the design of that spirit formation?” Kong Yuehua asked.

The two of them also wished to join the people setting up the spirit formation. Merely, they had no idea what sort of spirit formation they were setting up right now. That was why they needed a spirit formation design.

“I have already prepared them for you two,” The guardian clan’s clan chief took out two spirit formation diagrams.

Upon receiving the spirit formation diagram, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua’s expressions changed again.

The two of them were both world spiritists. In fact, Kong Yuehua’s world spirit techniques could be said to be very excellent too.

However... neither of them were capable of telling exactly what sort of spirit formation it was. That said, they were certain that it was an extraordinary spirit formation. That spirit formation could be said to be extremely profound.
