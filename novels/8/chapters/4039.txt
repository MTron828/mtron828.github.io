Chapter 4039 - Soldiers At The City Wall

They knew extremely well what sort of existence the Wuming Clan was.

They had been the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield for many years.

Back then, Chu Hanxian had been forced to leave by none other than the Wuming Clan.

Even Chu Xuanyuan had not been an exception.

When Chu Feng was an infant, had it not been for the Wuming Clan’s oppression, he and his father Chu Xuanyuan would not have been exiled to suffer in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

Even though the Wuming Clan had suffered disastrous losses in their battle against the Linghu Heavenly Clan, with only a small number of their experts managing to escape. The majority of their clansmen had died at the hands of the Linghu Heavenly Clan...

Even though the current Wuming Clan should’ve been much weaker than before...

The Wuming Clan was still an existence that the Chu Heavenly Clan could not contend with.

On top of that, due to the many years of oppression they’d suffered at the hands of the Wuming Clan, hearing about the Wuming Clan brought much more terror upon the hearts of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen compared to the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

“Lord Clan Chief, since the Wuming Clan has decided to return, they’ve undoubtedly come for the status of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord. How are we supposed to respond to them?”

“Should we immediately ask the Three Cities for assistance?”

“Request assistance. That’s right, we have to request assistance. Else, we’re simply no match for them.”

The elders were all terrified. Even their voices were filled with fear.

“Request assistance? The Three Cities are so far from us, whereas this Wuming Clan is right outside our Chu Heavenly Clan. There won’t be enough time for us to request assistance now,” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

His tone was rather unpleasant.

It was mainly because he despised those cowardly elders.

“Lord Clan Chief, I have a plan.”

Suddenly, a relatively calm elder spoke.

“What is your plan? It doesn’t hurt to let us hear it,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“The Wuming Clan has returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield without any sound or commotion.”

“This means that they’ve just returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield, and have come straight for our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Their intention should obviously be to retrieve their overlord status from us.”

“Now that the Purple Star Hall has just so happened to invite the overlords of the various starfields to participate in their gathering, why don’t we take this opportunity to yield the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord status to the Wuming Clan, and have them go keep that appointment instead?” said the elder.

“That is indeed a good method.”

Many elders expressed their approval upon hearing those words.

However, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head.

“That wouldn’t do. This Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord status has been given to our clan by the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.”

“Unless the Ancestral Martial Dragon City personally calls for our abdication, we cannot hand over our overlord status to anyone, regardless of who they might be,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“But Lord Clan Chief, we... are no match for the Wuming Clan.”

“Lord Clan Chief, whilst face is indeed important, it is nowhere near as important as the safety of our clansmen.”

“Lord Clan Chief, please reconsider.”

Many elders knelt.

They all hoped that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would be willing to give up on their overlord status so as to ensure the safety of their Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Shut up. If anyone dares to urge Lord Clan Chief again, I will personally kill him!” Chu Xuanzhengfa shouted angrily.

Hearing those words, the elders immediately grew quiet.

They knew Chu Xuanzhengfa’s temper very well. He was someone who would do what he said.

If they ended up angering him too much, they might really end up being killed by him.

“Lord Clan Chief, what should we do then?” Chu Hanpeng stepped up to ask.

He knew their Lord Clan Chief’s personality rather well. Thus, he did not bother trying to dissuade him. He knew it would be useless even if he did.

As such, he was fully prepared to listen to their Lord Clan Chief’s arrangements.

“Everyone, do not panic. Allow this old man to personally handle this matter.”

As the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he soared into the sky and flew away.

Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others from the Law Enforcement Hall immediately followed suit.

As for Chu Hanpeng, he swept his gaze across the crowd before flying upward. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Our Clan has always been united in our advance and retreat. If you all still consider yourself members of the Chu Heavenly Clan, follow Lord Clan Chief to confront them.”

After saying those words, he flew after the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

As for the other elders, they looked at one another in dismay. However, in the end, no one stayed behind. All of them flew after the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Whilst it was one thing for them to be cowardly, they still knew their statuses.

......

With powers from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield coming to offer their respects, the Chu Heavenly Clan was currently the place with the most activity in the entire starfield.

When the Wuming Clan arrived at the Chu Heavenly Clan, news of their arrival had immediately spread.

Because of that, everybody had rushed over to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s entrance.

When they saw that the overwhelmingly mighty troops standing neatly in midair really were the members of the Wuming Clan...

Some people felt flustered.

And some felt ecstatic.

Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan lacked strength, their Clan Chief was not only very good-natured towards everyone, he was also capable of distinguishing gratitude and grudges, and had always been fair in the way he handled things.

He was different from the overwhelmingly despotic Wuming Clan of the past, who would turn a blind eye to the other powers’ conflicts.

Because of that, during the short period of time they had ruled, many people felt the Chu Heavenly Clan to be a competent overlord.

Because of that, many people hoped that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would continue to rule over the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Should that be the case, they would be able to obtain a better environment to cultivate in.

As such, those people did not wish for anyone to replace the Chu Heavenly Clan.

That said, the appearance of the Wuming Clan also made them realize that they had not come with kind intentions.

That was why those people were so flustered.

As for the ecstatic people, they were naturally those that had never acknowledged the Chu Heavenly Clan and had only been putting on a disguise of respect. In truth, they actually looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clan within their hearts.

They were people that felt humiliated merely by the fact that the Chu Heavenly Clan was serving as the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord. They felt that they were unable to raise their heads when facing other starfields’ powers.

The return of the Wuming Clan was precisely what they wanted.

Besides, the Wuming Clan had come fiercely.

Their army was filled with experts.

The Six Great Utmost Exalteds, Ten Great Experts and numerous other experts were all there.

It could be said that apart from the Wuming Clan’s Clan Chief, Wuming Doutian, all of the Wuming Clan’s experts were present.

The Six Great Utmost Exalteds were all Utmost Exalted-level experts.

The Ten Great Experts were all peak Exalted-level experts. They were existences a step away from becoming Utmost Exalteds.

Apart from the Ten Great Experts, there were many other peak Exalted-level experts in the Wuming Clan.

As for ordinary Exalted-level experts, there were simply too many to count.

Their might was simply not something that the Chu Heavenly Clan could match.

The disparity in their strengths could even be said to be as vast as heaven and earth.

After all, the Chu Heavenly Clan had very few Exalted-level experts, and even their strongest Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was only a peak Exalted-level expert.

Even disregarding the peak experts, the ordinary clansmen were also on completely different levels.

The Chu Heavenly Clan could not be compared to the Wuming Clan in any of these aspects.

Everyone felt that if the Wuming Clan wanted to reclaim their starfield’s overlord status, the Chu Heavenly Clan simply did not have the ability to resist.

In fact, they would not even dare to utter a single fart before submissively yielding their overlord status to the Wuming Clan.
