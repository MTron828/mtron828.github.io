MGA: Chapter 630 - Who Exactly Are You

At the same time, in the center of the palace, the cross that bound Chu Feng still remained, but no more traces of him did.

Although Chu Feng was gone, there were a few rows of words left in the center of the palace. They were words made by Spirit Formations, and the content was...

“I thank Beauty Ya Fei for her generous gift; Wuqing shall accept them all. In the future, Wuqing will definitely repay such a chest-rending favour by many times.”

“Dammit. It was him!” The smart Ya Fei immediately understood the truth: the one who robbed the place wasn’t a traitor in the Immortal Execution Archipelago. It was the person she locked in the treasury.

She thought that this place was indestructible, so imprisoning Chu Feng here to make him a puppet was the best location. Yet, she never would have expected Chu Feng to use some unknown method to not only escape, but to also rob everything, making her take such a huge blow.

At that moment, Ya Fei gritted her teeth in anger. Even her chest could explode from fury, and she was so angry that smoke could be seen coming from her facial orifices. She clenched her fist tightly and ferociously said, “Wuqing, Wuqing, Wuqing! Damn Wuqing!

“So the one who saved the monster with Little Fishy was you! I’ve truly underestimated you. I didn’t expect you to have this ability. Not only did you escape from this treasury, you even stole a year’s worth of profit from my Immortal Execution Archipelago.

“But don’t you worry. I have never suffered losses from anyone. Don’t even think of being an exception.

“Do you truly think you can escape from my palms? I will let you know what I am capable of. It is something that you cannot even imagine. You will all die!!”

After speaking, Ya Fei suddenly willed, and formless aura instantly spread everywhere. With a bang, the Spirit Formation words Chu Feng left behind were shattered, and simultaneously, strong bloodlust filled the entire palace.

As Ya Fei became enraged, Chu Feng and Little Fishy had already left the Everlasting Sea of Blood. The reason why they were so fast was naturally all because of Little Fishy’s speed.

Although they had already left, for safety’s sake, they did not remain on top of the sea surface. They entered the sea and laid a Concealment Spirit Formation.

“Who exactly are you?!”

At present, Chu Feng was carefully examining the monster. He then discovered that it was as if the densely-packed water grasses were merged with its body. And even with his Spirit power, he could not detect anything through them. He could not examine its condition. Even using the Heaven’s Eyes he could not.

So, that made a thought enter his head—the monster was truly only a monster. Its appearance was indeed only of a special monster. Then yet, why did that monster have such a familiar feel to it? And why didn’t it kill him?

*whoosh*

However, just as Chu Feng was patching up his guesses, the monster suddenly opened its eyes. Immediately as the blood-red eyes appeared, Chu Feng felt extremely dense bloodlust.

But the bloodlust only existed for a moment before disappearing into nothingness, as in the moment the monster saw Chu Feng, its blood-red eyes instantly brightened. Obviously, it recognized him.

“You really do recognize me? Who are you? Where did you come from?” Seeing such a reaction, Chu Feng hurriedly barraged it with questions. He truly wanted to know why the monster didn’t kill him, exactly how it was related to him, and whether or not it was truly related to his ancestry.

*wuao* However, just at that moment, the monster hugged its head with both hands and knelt on the floor. It started to cry in anguish. Its voice was loud, causing the Spirit Formation they were in to violently shake. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At first, Chu Feng panicked a bit as he faced such a change from the monster because he could not be sure if the monster was truly not going to harm him or not. With its strength, if it truly lost control and wished to harm Chu Feng, he would not be able to do anything at all.

But, Chu Feng gradually discovered that concurrent to the monster’s cries of agony, its voice actually changed as well. From the low roar of something like a wild beast, it slowly became a human-like sound.

At the same time, the monster’s appearance also changed. The long water grasses started to retract, then at the end, it became a humanoid shape.

It was a female, covered by blue-coloured scales all across her body. But, she still had blood-red eyes and her face was fraught with pain as she screamed miserably.

“It’s you?!” After seeing that person, Chu Feng’s expression changed greatly too as he felt such disbelief. Because, he had already recognized who the person in front of him was.

She was the number one disciple of the Jade Maiden School from the continent of the Nine Provinces, the one who had a relationship with Chu Feng, Yan Ruyu.

Although she looked nothing like before, as she lost all of her former beautiful complexion, Chu Feng was still able to determine that the female was Yan Ruyu.

Chu Feng was truly a bit befuddled at that moment. He had made many guesses, trying to speculate the identity of the monster, but it being Yan Ruyu didn’t even cross his mind.

After all, the monster was currently so strong, yet Yan Ruyu’s strength back then wasn’t very strong. Even though she practiced Forbidden Mysterious Techniques, it shouldn’t be possible for her to reach her present stage of strength.

“Scram! Quickly scram! Or else, I will kill you!”

Just at that moment, the monster suddenly roared furiously at Chu Feng. Though its voice was a bit rigid and full of resentment, the tone did indeed belong to Yan Ruyu, no doubt.

“Waa, now this is interesting. Chu Feng, this ruthless monster that refines humans is actually your former lover! No wonder she isn’t willing to kill you. Hehe.”

After recognizing Yan Ruyu, even Eggy was surprised. But, she was different from Chu Feng. As the bystander, she clearly had an attitude of schadenfreude as she looked at the drama, lacking any fear of aggravating the situation.

“Why has this happened? How can it be you?!” Upon recognizing Yan Ruyu, Chu Feng’s gaze glittered, his heart in complete disorder.

Because looking at it from a certain point of view, the reason why Yan Ruyu became what she is today was all because of Chu Feng. If Chu Feng hadn’t forced a “relationship” with Yan Ruyu, it wouldn’t have made the Forbidden Mysterious Technique she practiced in lose control.

Although it was Yan Ruyu in the wrong at first, after all, Chu Feng hadn’t had too severe of a loss. It was only because he wanted to vent his anger that he turned a female with quite a good future into her current appearance that looked neither like a human nor a ghost. Deep in Chu Feng’s heart, the only thing surging about was regret.

“Wa ha ha ha ha ha!

“How can’t it not be her?!”

However, just as Chu Feng’s heart was in chaos—having quite some trouble accepting the truth in front of his eyes—Yan Ruyu suddenly laughed sinisterly, and extremely strangely as well. Even her speaking voice became abnormally sharp.

Looking back at Yan Ruyu in front of his eyes, Chu Feng discovered that the scales on her body had already faded away, turning her back into the former alluring, great beauty.

Seductive curves, snow-white skin, pretty face, bright eyes, fiery, exceptional body, all of that was not covered by anything at present. In complete bare nakedness, it appeared before Chu Feng.

But facing such changes from Yan Ruyu, Chu Feng lightly furrowed his brows, as if he understood something, then fiercely and austerely asked, “Who exactly are you?!”
