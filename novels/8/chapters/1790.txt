MGA: Chapter 1790 - Dumbstruck

“Humph.”

However, while Leng Yue was only a rank nine Half Martial Emperor, she possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. She... was a Half Martial Emperor capable of fighting against Martial Emperors.

However, even with this being the case, a Half Martial Emperor would remain a Half Martial Emperor, while a Martial Emperor would remain a Martial Emperor. While Leng Yue was capable of fighting against the Water Immortal Profound Technique, her imposing might was still inferior to its imposing might.

As this continued, Leng Yue had no choice but to start using martial skills. She had to borrow the strength of her martial skills to fight against the Water Immortal Profound Technique.

“Not bad, not bad. You’re actually capable of being equally matched against my Water Immortal Profound Technique.”

“It would seem this is still not your limit. Since this is the case, I’ll help you out,” Like an observer, Chu Feng mocked and ridiculed Leng Yue.

As he spoke, his gaze flashed. Then, like a volcanic eruption, boundless flames exploded from his body.

When the flames appeared, not only was this region covered with heat, the surging flames also turned into a man of fire. With a might akin to raging flames burning the heavens, the man of fire charged to attack Leng Yue from a different direction.

“This!!!”

When Leng Yue saw the incoming man of fire, her expression immediately changed. That man of fire’s aura was actually exactly the same as that of the Water Immortal Profound Technique; it was also a rank one Martial Emperor.

“Fire Immortal Profound Technique, it’s the long lost Fire Immortal Profound Technique! Chu Feng, where did you obtain that?!” Upon seeing the Fire Immortal Profound Technique, Leng Yue was extremely shocked.

“There is no need for me to inform you of something like this. You wish to know? How about... you do a striptease dance for this gentleman here? If you make me happy, I might consider telling you. However, there’s also a possibility of your figure being too bad that this gentleman will end up becoming disgusted. If that’s the case... I will not tell you,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

Once Chu Feng said those words, Baili Xinghe immediately sucked in a mouthful of cold air. Leng Yue was the number one disciple of the Heavenly Law Palace, an existence high above everyone else. Had there ever been anyone who dared to disrespect her?

Yet, Chu Feng had deliberately done such a thing.

“Chu Feng, you’re courting death,” Upon hearing what Chu Feng said, Leng Yue became extremely angry. As she spoke, she flipped her palm, and a golden-bright and dazzling rod appeared in her hand.

Once that rod appeared, a ray of golden light began to spread out from within Leng Yue’s body.

The reason for that was because that rod was no ordinary rod. Instead, it was an Incomplete Imperial Armament. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Once she revealed her Incomplete Imperial Armament, Leng Yue’s battle power instantly increased. Although she was fighting against two rank one Martial Emperors, she actually held the upper hand against them.

Leng Yue’s Divine Power was a type of powerful wind. It just so happened that her Incomplete Imperial Armament was able to work harmoniously with her Divine Power, increasing her battle power even further.

“Huu, huu, huu~~~”

At this moment, the violent wind was whistling as explosions began to sound from all around. Being blown by that devastating wind, the water was no longer fierce, and the fire was no longer ferocious. Leng Yue was unstoppable. She held absolute superiority.

However, the strongest aspect of the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique was that they were indestructible. No matter how strong Leng Yue was, she was unable to destroy them. All she could do was end up being tangled in a battle against them.

“Chu Feng, do you dare to fight me yourself?” Leng Yue shouted angrily.

“What’s wrong? You’re unable to win against my secret skills?”

“When you are unable to even win against my secret skills, how are you qualified to fight against me?” Chu Feng was fiddling with his sleeve, and had an inattentive appearance as he spoke those words. It was as if he were truly only an observer.

“I’m only asking you whether you dare or not,” Leng Yue was so angered that her face turned red. She felt as if her heart and lungs were about to explode because of Chu Feng.

However, although she was extremely angry, she also had no choice but to become serious.

Originally, she had not placed Chu Feng in her eyes. However, she had never expected that Chu Feng would force her to such a state using only two secret skills. Not only had she used her Divine Power, she had also used her Incomplete Imperial Armament.

Right now, she wished to quickly end this battle. However, the only method for her to be able to end this battle quickly would be to fight against Chu Feng, and not continue to be tangled with the two secret skills.

“Leng Yue, oh Leng Yue, you’re forcing me to fight. However, I must tell you this. If I, Chu Feng, am to fight, you’ll have to prepare to pay the price,” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out an Incomplete Imperial Armament. It was a sword.

The sword was extremely thin. In fact, it was so thin that it didn’t appear to be a sword, and instead looked more like a very thin and long ruler. However, not only was it a sword, it was also the impressively famous Heavenly Immortal Sword.

“Enough of your rubbish. Come and fight me with your strength,” Leng Yue shouted again.

“The Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique are parts of my strength to begin with,” Holding the Heavenly Immortal Sword, Chu Feng stepped into the air and began to walk toward Leng Yue one step at a time, “However, since you insist on fighting against me, I can grant you your wish.”

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng took a step forward, and his speed increased in a flash. As his clothes and long hair fluttered in the wind, Chu Feng’s speed reached the speed of light. In a flash, he arrived before Leng Yue.

When Chu Feng arrived, like two spirits, the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique entered Chu Feng’s body.

At this moment, only Chu Feng and Leng Yue stood in midair.

The two of them possessed the same cultivation, the same heaven-defying battle power and were both part of the younger generation...

At this moment, even Baili Xinghe opened his eyes wide to earnestly look to the sky. He did not wish to miss out on this confrontation between the strongest members of the younger generation.

“Huu, huu, huu~~~”

Leng Yue had unleashed her attack. The rod in her hand was extremely sharp. The sound it emitted was akin to the cry of ten thousand beasts. Adding onto her Divine Power, it could be said that she possessed unrivalled divine might.

To be exact, Chu Feng’s current opponent could not be considered to be a Half Martial Emperor. Instead, Leng Yue should be considered a Martial Emperor. After all... Leng Yue was able to suppress two rank one Martial Emperors.

However... Chu Feng was also not an ordinary Half Martial Emperor.

“Clank~~~”

Chu Feng moved, and his Heavenly Immortal Sword moved alongside him. The movement of the Heavenly Immortal Sword was no small matter.

“Snap!” The incoming wind that looked like ferocious beasts was split apart by the Heavenly Immortal Sword. Not only that, with that slash from the Heavenly Immortal Sword, space itself was split in half. It was as if there were nothing that could stop it.

“Clank~~~”

Suddenly, an ear-piercing sound was heard. That slash was stopped. It was stopped by the rod in Leng Yue’s hand.

“My Heavenly Law Unfettered Rod is not inferior to your Heavenly Immortal Sword,” After stopping Chu Feng’s attack, Leng Yue, who had been in a rage before, revealed a complacent smile.

“While the weapons are equally matched, I wonder, are your rod techniques comparable to my sword techniques?” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he shouted, “Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique!!!”

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

With a trembling of his hand, the Heavenly Immortal Sword Chu Feng held instantly turned into a myriad of blade rays. With an overwhelming power of righteousness, they surged toward Leng Yue.

“You’ll come to know,” Leng Yue was not to be outdone. She waved her rod around and collided with Chu Feng.

Although Chu Feng’s sword was extremely thin, it was incomparably hard.

As for Leng Yue’s rod, although it was thick and long, it was flexible like a snake, and capable of changing nonstop.

The attacks between the two fighters were extremely fast. As they confronted one another, they were evenly matched.

“So powerful. Their strength has already surpassed that of all their fellow members of the younger generation. Only the Martial Emperors from the older generations are capable of contending against them.”

“Chu Feng actually reached such a level in such a short period of time,” Baili Xinghe was already no longer capable of clearly seeing the attacks between the two fighters. However, he was able to tell that Chu Feng and Leng Yue were equally matched.

At this moment, Baili Xinghe had an extremely downcast expression as he tightly clenched his fists. He wished for Chu Feng’s death at Leng Yue’s hands. Yet... Chu Feng was not showing any signs of defeat. Instead, he seemed to faintly hold the upper hand in this battle.

In this sort of situation, Baili Xinghe... felt extremely nervous.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Suddenly, light began to shine brightly at the location of Chu Feng and Leng Yue’s battle. Those were the lights of sword rays. That light was formed by tens of thousands of sword rays flashing past simultaneously.

“Woosh~~~”

A figure shot out explosively from the light. It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had left the battle.

“What’s going on?” Originally, Baili Xinghe had thought that Chu Feng had become afraid and ran away. However, he soon discovered that not only was Chu Feng completely uninjured, he even had a mischievous smile on his face. Upon seeing that smile, Baili Xinghe knew that Chu Feng was not afraid. Rather, he must have some sort of different plan.

Right at this moment, Leng Yue’s body appeared before his line of sight.

“Heavens, that!!!” Upon seeing the current Leng Yue, Baili Xinghe’s mouth was wide open. He was dumbstruck.
