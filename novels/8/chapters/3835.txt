Chapter 3835 - Perhaps It’s Something Bad

“It’s nothing, just some personal matters of our Red-dress Holy Land,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“Girl, if there’s anything that you need my assistance with, do not hesitate to tell me. You and I are friends, there is no need to be overly courteous with me," said Chu Feng.

Yin Zhuanghong felt slightly moved upon hearing those words. Without saying anything, she nodded.

Then, the two of them chatted for a while before Yin Zhuanghong took her leave.

In the following days, Yin Zhuanghong would visit Chu Feng every day. Furthermore, she would also order people to deliver refreshments and dimsum to him.

That said, Yin Zhuanghong was very busy. She would only visit Chu Feng for a short period of time before leaving.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that Yin Zhuanghong had been introducing Chu Feng as Asura to others.

She did not mention his true identity to anyone.

This caused Chu Feng to have a better impression of her.

After all, that girl still gave thought to his circumstances.

Furthermore, Chu Feng had originally thought that Yin Zhuanghong had invited him over because she needed his help.

After all, like Grandmaster Yuan Shu and Zhang Duotuo, Chu Feng was also a world spiritist.

However, Chu Feng discovered that the attitude of Yin Zhuanghong and the others simply did not resemble people that needed his help. Instead, they behaved purely as hosts, entertaining him.

Furthermore, the Red-dress Holy Land was actually not a place that welcomed outsiders, especially men.

Yet, Chu Feng received the treatment of a distinguished guest from the moment he had arrived at the Red-dress Holy Land.

Chu Feng knew that he was only able to receive this sort of treatment because the people from the Red-dress Holy Land were giving Yin Zhuanghong face.

With all that being said, Chu Feng did not idle around while staying as a guest in the Red-dress Holy Land.

He handed the World Spirit Jade and all the treasures from those eleven world spiritists he had obtained from the World Spirit Mansion Gate to Yu Sha, and had her start training with them.

The World Spirit Jade was very impressive. As for the treasures from those eleven world spiritists, they were also treasures that were helpful towards world spirits’ cultivations. Thus, Chu Feng felt that if Yu Sha were to train with them, she would most likely be able to make a breakthrough.

As for Chu Feng himself, he had started to delve into the box that he had obtained in the World Spirit Mansion Gate.

Chu Feng felt that should he be able to meticulous study it and decipher it completely, he would be able to make progress towards becoming a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

“Young master Asura.”

Chu Feng was training when a sweet-sounding voice calling his name sounded from outside. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

During the days Chu Feng had been in the Red-dress Holy Land, he had practically never gone out of his residence. Rather than saying that he was staying there as a guest, it would be more accurate to say that he was staying there to train. Thus, Chu Feng did not know many people in the Red-dress Holy Land.

Apart from Yin Zhuanghong, Chu Feng was only rather familiar with a single person.

She was a woman by the name of Lil Xin. This Lil Xin was Yin Zhuanghong’s trusted aide, and would bring refreshments and dimsum to Chu Feng everyday.

Hearing Lil Xin’s voice, Chu Feng knew that something delicious had arrived.

Chu Feng stopped training and opened the door to his room. Sure enough, Lil Xin was standing outside, and had properly arranged the refreshments and dimsum on the dining table.

Chu Feng did not hesitate. He took a seat, casually picked up a piece of dimsum and placed it into his mouth.

“Eh? Lil Xin, how come the taste of the dimsum today has changed?”

“Girl, you’re inattentive today,” Chu Feng said to Lil Xin with a smile.

“Young master Asura, are you really stupid, or pretending to be stupid? Did you really think that I was the one who made that dimsum?” Lil Xin asked with a pouted mouth.

“This dimsum isn’t made by you?” Chu Feng asked.

“The ones today are. However, the ones from before weren’t,” said Lil Xin.

“Oh? In that case, who made the ones from before? Her dimsum is much better than yours," Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Of course those were tasty. The ones from before were made by our Lady Holy Daughter,” said Lil Xin.

“Stop joking around. With how dangerous that girl is, how could she have the time to make dimsum?”

“Besides, your aura was present on that dimsum, whereas her aura was not," as Chu Feng spoke, he placed several more pieces of dimsum into his mouth. He did not believe what Lil Xin had said.

“Milady Holy Daughter deliberately refused to allow you to know, thus you will naturally not know about it," said Lil Xin.

“You’re still trying to lie? With how busy she is, how could she have the time to make dimsum? Did you take me for a fool?” Chu Feng still didn’t believe Lil Xin.

“She is busy, but she still made that dimsum for you. Do you now know how blessed you are?”

“You should know that in the entire Red-dress Holy Land, apart from our Lady Headmaster, no one else has managed to eat dimsum made by our Lady Holy Daughter,” Lil Xin had a look of envy as she said those words.

“You’re saying that that dimsum was truly made by that girl?” Chu Feng started to believe Lil Xin after seeing her expression.

“Of course. Why would I lie to you?” said Lil Xin.

“Truly never would I have imagined that that girl actually possesses such an accomplished skill." At that moment, the corners of Chu Feng’s lips rose into a faint smile.

He was unable to help himself from remembering that dimsum. The taste was truly superb with no fault to be found.

“Whilst they are tasty, you might not be able to taste them anymore,” Lil Xin spoke with a pouting mouth.

“Why wouldn’t I be able to eat them again? Lil Xin, what are you implying?”

Chu Feng stood up and looked at the somewhat dispirited Lil Xin. He realized that something was fishy.

“Is young master Asura present?”

Suddenly, a voice sounded from outside.

Hearing that voice, Chu Feng narrowed his brows. The reason for that was because that was Meng Rufei’s voice.

Meng Rufei and Zhang Duotuo had arrived at the Red-dress Holy Land as guests together with Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng had never seen them once in the days he had stayed in the Red-dress Holy Land.

Today, Meng Rufei had taken the initiative to pay him a visit. Furthermore, he spoke with such a delighted voice, as if some sort of joyous matter had occurred. This caused Chu Feng to realize that that fellow might have come with ill-intentions.

After all, something joyous for that fellow would definitely be something bad for Chu Feng.

“Lil Xin, wait here.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng walked out.

Sure enough, when Chu Feng saw Meng Rufei, he appeared completely different.

He was full of mettle and extremely pleased. An unconcealable smile was present on his face.

He had the look of a groom who was about to consummate his wedding night, a look of extreme glee.
