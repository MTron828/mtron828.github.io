Chapter 2668 - Incomparably Astonished

“Putt~~~”

Seeing that Chu Xuanzhengfa was furious, Chu Yue and Chu Huai immediately kneeled back onto the ground and did not dare to even raise their heads.

It could be seen that they were very afraid of Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Vice Hall Master, please quell your anger,” the crowd in the Law Enforcement Hall said in unison.

However, Chu Xuanzhengfa’s anger did not diminish. He turned to Chu Huai and asked, “Do you possess proof of your accusation?”

“Milord, this matter is absolutely true. The two of us have personally witnessed it.”

“Furthermore, it is not only the two of us that have witnessed this.”

“Due to the fact that Chu Bore wanted to silence everyone by killing them, he revealed himself and acted openly.”

“Thus, many people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm also witnessed Chu Bore’s true identity.”

“They all know that the mastermind behind the calamity was him,” Chu Huai said.

“I already knew that he has done some despicable things for the sake of extending his lifespan.”

“However, never would I have imagined that he would do this sort of inhumane thing for the sake of living longer. His actions are simply a disgrace to our Chu Heavenly Clan’s reputation.”

“If the evidence is conclusive, Chu Bore will not be spared.”

Chu Xuanzhengfa’s state of mind eased slightly. However, the anger in his eyes did not decrease.

“Men! Immediately go to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and arrest Chu Bore,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Yes, Milord.” Ten individuals from the Law Enforcement Hall stood forth of their own accord. After bowing respectfully, they began to walk toward the exit of the Law Enforcement Hall.

“Chu Huai, Chu Yue, I will investigate this matter. If it is really as you two have said, not only will I punish Chu Bore for his crimes, but I will also reward the two of you,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Thank you Milord,” Chu Huai and Chu Yue both revealed joyous expressions.

The two of them believed in Chu Xuanzhengfa’s investigative abilities. Since he got involved, they believed that Chu Bore would definitely admit to his crimes.

If that wasn’t the case, the two of them would not have come to report this matter to Chu Xuanzhengfa.

Thus, when Chu Xuanzhengfa had decided to personally order an investigation into the matter, they did not fear that Chu Bore would refuse to admit to it. They were only waiting for Chu Bore to be convicted of his crimes and then obtain their rewards.

“All of you can leave now,” Chu Xuanzhengfa waved his hand.

Then, Chu Huai, Chu Yue and everyone else from the Law Enforcement Hall left.

At that moment, only Chu Xuanzhengfa and his daughter Chu Lingxi remained in the Great Law Enforcement Hall.

“Chu Feng...” Chu Xuanzhengfa had a pensive appearance on his face as he muttered that name.

“Father, it seems that you’re quite interested in that Chu Feng?” Chu Lingxi walked toward Chu Xuanzhengfa with graceful steps and hands behind her back.

“Aren’t you yourself also very interested? If you weren’t interested, you wouldn’t have returned after leaving, no?” Chu Xuanzhengfa said with a smile on his face.

“Humph, I have no interest in him at all. I was merely interested in the mission to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect.”

“If it wasn’t for you refusing to allow me to challenge that mission, how could that Chu Feng possibly be able to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect?” Chu Lingxi said with a pout.

“Lingxi, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s Infant Soul Sect was not as easy to handle as you imagined. Else... I would not have prevented you from taking the mission like I did,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“You do not trust me. Back then, if you had allowed me to go, I would definitely have been able to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect.”

“I have already made inquiries about them. The strongest among the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm are only rank two True Immortals.”

“As for me, I reached rank three True Immortal when I was thirty-nine years old. At that time, I was still within the age limit for the mission. As such, how could I be unable to eliminate a mere Infant Soul Sect?” Chu Lingxi said in a very annoyed manner.

“Okay okay, father was wrong, okay?” Chu Xuanzhengfa said with a smile on his face.

However, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not truly believe that he was wrong. Merely, he did not wish to continue to quarrel with Chu Lingxi.

“Humph,” Chu Lingxi raised her head. She did not appreciate her father giving in at all.

“Lingxi, do you wish to know what father is thinking about?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“What are you thinking about?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“I’m thinking that this Chu Feng might not be as simple as Chu Huai and Chu Yue have found out,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Why do you say that?” Chu Lingxi asked curiously.

“I’m thinking that Chu Feng might be Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Wasn’t it said that that trash already died? Even if he’s still alive, he is still trash. Thus, it shouldn’t be possible for this Chu Feng to be that trash, no?” Chu Lingxi said.

“There’s an exception to everything. Furthermore... you all simply do not know Chu Xuanyuan. He is an unfathomable individual,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Assuming he is Chu Xuanyuan’s son, what more could it signify?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“If he really is Chu Xuanyuan’s son, then this Chu Feng would be a truly serious matter,” Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke with deep emotions.

“Why’s that?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“Merely because he is Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Father, is that Chu Xuanyuan really that amazing? You’re exaggerating things, no?” Chu Lingxi narrowed her long, shapely eyebrows in a disbelieving manner.

“Haha...” Chu Xuanzhengfa burst into faint laughter. He said, “After what happened back then, Chu Xuanyuan became a taboo in the clan. Very few people dared to mention his name, and even fewer people dared to mention things concerning him.”

“Furthermore, many people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were afraid of offending our Chu Heavenly Clan, and thus didn’t dare to mention Chu Xuanyuan either. This has led to you all knowing very little about Chu Xuanyuan.”

“Because of that, it is normal for you all to doubt Chu Xuanyuan’s strength.”

“However, if anyone from my generation dared to doubt Chu Xuanyuan’s strength, we would be laughed at by others.”

“Then, between him and father, who is stronger?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“Haha,” Chu Xuanzhengfa laughed. This time around, he laughed very loudly. It was as if he had heard a funny joke.

Then, he turned to Chu Lingxi and asked, “Lingxi, how old are you now?”

“Forty-five. Why do you ask me that when you already know?” Chu Lingxi curled her lips.

“Lingxi, you possess excellent talent. Compared to when father was forty-five, you are stronger,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Of course,” Chu Lingxi curled her lips proudly.

“When father was forty-five, Chu Xuanyuan was only twenty-nine,” Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke meaningfully.

“In that case, it would mean that when father was forty-five, that Chu Xuanyuan was inferior to you, no?” Chu Lingxi said.

There was a sixteen year difference between Chu Xuanyuan and her father. During the early years of martial cultivation, such a difference in age was sufficient to create an enormous disparity in cultivation. This was even more so considering her father was not some nobody. Instead, he was known to be a genius in the Chu Heavenly Clan since his youth.

Thus, Chu Lingxi felt that when Chu Xuanyuan was twenty-nine years old, he should have been weaker than her father.

However, Chu Xuanzhengfa smiled and shook his head at Chu Lingxi’s response.

“Lingxi, when your father was forty-five years old, your grandfather held the status that your father currently holds. He was our Chu Heavenly Clan’s Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master.”

“I know that. Grandfather was a Vice Hall Master for many years before finally ascending to Hall Master,” Chu Lingxi said.

“Indeed, you knew that. However, there is one thing that you do not know,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“What is it?” Chu Lingxi asked curiously.

“When your father was forty-five years old, I was still training hard for the sake of my ranking among the younger generations. As for the things regarding the clan, I simply did not concern myself with them at all. Furthermore, I did not possess the strength to concern myself with the clan’s matters either.”

“However, at that time, Chu Xuanyuan, who was a total of sixteen years younger than your father, was this Law Enforcement Hall’s Hall Master,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Ah?”

Chu Lingxi’s beautiful eyes and mouth immediately opened wide upon hearing those words. Incomparable astonishment filled her beautiful young face.

She had thought the entire time that when her grandfather ascended to the Law Enforcement Hall’s Hall Master, the person that held the status before her grandfather must have been one of the few Utmost Exalted Elders of their Chu Heavenly Clan.

After all, with the strength that her grandfather had back then, only those existences were capable of surpassing her grandfather. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Thus, she never expected for the person that stood above her grandfather to be a twenty-nine-year-old member of the younger generation.
