Chapter 4482: It’s Really Xian Miaomiao

There was not a single person present who was calm at the moment.

While the crowd had guessed that Chu Feng had an extraordinary background, they didn’t think that he would be acquainted with this noble princess.

Even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and the others were unable to retain their composure. Shock and bewilderment were written all over their faces.

They had previously heard from an elder of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect that Chu Feng was on good terms with the Lady of Dao Sea, but as they had yet to see it with their own eyes, they still reserved some doubts regarding this matter.

But never in their wildest imagination did they think that he would actually be acquainted with a lofty princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan too.

Looking at how Princess Miaomiao was hugging him tightly, crying sorrowfully as if she was on the verge of mental breakdown, it was clear that they weren’t just mere acquaintances.

“Young friend Chu Feng, just who in the world are you? Why do you know so many formidable people?”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and the other experts couldn’t but help remark under their breath.

Yin Daifen, Fu Feiyue, Yu Hong, Yu Yin, and the others also had complicated looks on their faces. At the very start, they thought that Chu Feng was a person with a lowly background who wasn’t qualified to even speak on equal terms to them.

But one by one, they were uncovering the connections he had with the powerhouses of the world. It was as if they were staring right into the unfathomable abyss—no matter how they looked, there was still more to him than they thought.

Recalling how they had treated Chu Feng at the very start, they couldn’t help but feel as if they were clowns. They deeply regretted their earlier actions.

While everyone finally grasped the situation, the two Supreme Elders looked at one another with a mulling look on their faces.

...

This turn of events was a blessing for some but a calamity for others.

Watching how his backing, Princess Youyou, was killed just like that, Zhao Yuzhuo was scared out of his wits. He didn’t think that Chu Feng would have such a backing behind him.

His tears and snot covered his face as he fell into despair. He felt like his life was over.

He had never regretted doing something as much as he did at this moment. If only he had known this in advance, he would have never dared to provoke Chu Feng.

However, it was already too late for regrets now. There was no way for him to rewind time and redo everything once again.

He knew that trying to talk his way out of this wouldn’t work—Princess Miaomiao didn’t look like she was interested in listening to any explanations right now, let alone that he was no more than an ant before her.

He knew that he had to escape right now. Otherwise, he would surely die. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Your Highness, that man over there is the culprit who inflicted such harm upon Chu Feng. You mustn’t allow him to escape!”

But just as Zhao Yuzhuo was about to make his escape, Long Xiaoxiao’s voice suddenly sounded.

When the white-haired elder was killed, Long Xiaoxiao managed to regain her freedom. It went without saying that she wouldn’t allow Zhao Yuzhuo to escape from here alive, especially since he was the one who dared to put his hands on Chu Feng.

As soon as Long Xiaoxiao spoke up, Zhao Yuzhuo darted away as fast as he could.

However, all he managed to do was to take a single step before he was bound tightly by a powerful force in midair.

Princess Miaomiao turned to look at her with rage burning in her eyes.

“Miaomiao, how should we deal with this man?” the black-haired old man asked.

“Grandpa Xuansheng, I want him to die a painful death,” Princess Miaomiao spat out with gritted teeth.

Shoosh!

The black-haired old man took out a ball of light that was around the size of a fist and tossed it toward Zhao Yuzhuo. As the ball of light came into contact with Zhao Yuzhuo, it suddenly expanded to over ten meters in diameter, enveloping Zhao Yuzhuo within it.

The ball of light was filled with crimson centipedes and black venomous worms, who immediately noticed Zhao Yuzhuo and charged toward their newfound prey.

Within the limited space of the ball of light, there was nowhere Zhao Yuzhuo could escape to. He could only helplessly watch as those centipedes and venomous bugs bit into his flesh and climbed into his body. Inhuman screams sounded from him as he struggled desperately in futility.

Princess Miaomiao shot Zhao Yuzhuo a glance before turning her eyes back to Chu Feng. By this point in time, she was starting to regain her composure.

“Grandpa Xuansheng, hurry up and treat him. I don’t care what means you use and what kind of price it takes, you have to make him recover fully!” Princess Miaomiao told her black-haired old man.

Without any hesitation, the black-haired old man walked over and treated Chu Feng.

Under his advanced skills, Chu Feng’s flesh began to grow back, and his aura was gradually returning too. It didn’t take long for him to be out of danger.

Watching as Chu Feng gradually recovered, Princess Miaomiao’s eyes turned moist again as her emotions became a little agitated.

“Chu Feng, I’m sorry. I came late!”

Princess Miaomiao exclaimed as she dived into Chu Feng’s embrace and hugged him tightly.

It was also then that life began returning back into Chu Feng’s eyes.

“Xiaoxiao, I’m fine...”

As soon as Chu Feng regained his consciousness, he felt someone crying in his embrace, and he immediately thought that it was Long Xiaoxiao.

However, he soon realized to his astonishment that Long Xiaoxiao was looking at him from a distance away. If that was the case, who was the one hugging him right now?

Chu Feng quickly pushed aside the person that was holding him tightly, only to see the face of the sorrowfully weeping Princess Miaomiao.

He froze in that instant.

“Miaomiao?” Chu Feng asked in disbelief.

He was extremely shocked. The woman before him was a person that he recognized.

She was the princess of the Holy Land of Martialism’s Elf Kingdom of Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, Xian Miaomiao.

But Xian Miaomiao was more than just the daughter of the Elf Kingdom. She had a mysterious mother who had given her a unique treasure that bestowed her nine lives.

Xian Miaomiao had once used one of her lives to save Chu Feng, and Chu Feng had remembered it clearly in his heart.

The two of them were also extremely close with one another. They had been through numerous life and death situations, such that Xian Miaomiao could be said to be one of Chu Feng’s closest friends back at the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

Back then, both he and Xiao Miaomiao were viewed to be the prodigies with the highest chance of leaving the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, so the two of them made a promise to meet at the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm in the future.

However, Xian Miaomiao never appeared.

Afterward, Chu Feng returned back to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm in seek of Xian Miaomiao’s whereabouts, only to learn that she had been taken away by her mother’s clan members. Chu Feng had tried to look into which clan Xiao Miaomiao’s mother was from but to no avail.

Many years had passed since then, but Chu Feng was certain that the person that was holding onto him right now was definitely Xian Miaomiao. There was no doubt about it.

“It looks like I have sustained quite a bite of injuries.” Snapping out of his astonishment, Chu Feng smacked his own head as he remarked with a bitter smile. “To think that I would actually start hallucinating now...”

He felt that he was dreaming at the moment because there was simply no way he could meet Xian Miaomiao here.

“What do you mean by hallucinating? Chu Feng, are you meaning to say that you don’t even recognize this princess anymore?”

Hearing those words from Chu Feng, Xian Miaomiao wiped off the tears from her eyes. She pouted her lips and glared at Chu Feng with a grudging look.

Chu Feng widened his eyes in shock. He quickly took a look at his surroundings and saw that he was still at the very same place as before.

It didn’t seem like he was hallucinating.

More importantly, he realized that the clothes Xian Miaomiao was wearing belonged to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. Or to be more exact, the robes she was dressed in were even more elaborate than the others.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng recalled the unique ability that Xiao Miaomiao had that granted her nine lives, and a realization struck him.
