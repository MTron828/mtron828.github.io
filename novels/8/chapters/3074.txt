Chapter 3074 - True Man

Everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan was astonished.

This was especially true for the elders that had spoken repeatedly of severely punishing Chu Youyuan. At that moment, they were shivering and sweating cold sweat in fear.

When those elders were already reacting like that, Chu Haoyan’s grandfather and Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather would naturally be even more panicky.

After all, they never would’ve imagined that the man before them was not Chu Youyuan, but instead their Lord Clan Chief.

Radiating awe, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke loudly, “Earlier, I’d said that what this old man saw is definitive evidence, and you all felt it to be ridiculous.”

“Right now, I will say it again. What this old man saw is definitive evidence. Is there anyone that still finds it to be ridiculous?”

Once he said those words, everyone lowered their heads. Being their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, what he said was law. No one would dare to raise any objections.

Seeing that no one was refuting him, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled and said, “All of you, rise.”

As he said those words, he waved his sleeve, and a gentle power immediately dispersed, lifting up everyone that was kneeling on the ground.

After that, he waved his sleeve again, and forced Chu Haoyan’s grandfather, Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather, Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi back onto their knees with his oppressive might.

He said, “As for you all, it’s better that you continue kneeling.”

“Lord Clan Chief, exactly what is happening?” Chu Hanpeng had a confused expression on his face.

The Lord Clan Chief did not immediately respond to his question. Instead, he turned to Chu Feng, smiled and said, “Chu Feng, I am actually not Chu Youyuan. The actual Chu Youyuan is currently in closed-door training at our Chu Wonderland.”

“In that case, senior, you’ve been deliberately disguising yourself as Lord Youyuan?”

“You were in disguise since the Yin Yang Gate?” Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. However, he still asked those questions to verify his guess.

“Indeed. If I didn’t disguise myself, how could I expose their true filthy appearances?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to the four people kneeling before him as he said those words.

Hearing those words, Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi’s faces immediately turned ashen. It was only at that moment that they realized the whole truth.

It turned out that the Chu Youyuan they had encountered in the Yin Yang Gate back then was not the actual Chu Youyuan. Instead, he was their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief in disguise.

For the sake of appearing realistic, their Lord Clan Chief even went as far as to deliberately be injured, and then flee into the Infernal Lake with Chu Feng.

At that moment, they were completely stunned. It was as their Lord Clan Chief had declared, his words were indeed definitive evidence.

Of course they were definitive evidence. After all, he was the Clan Chief of their Chu Heavenly Clan, the ruler of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the king of their entire world.

Originally, Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi had thought that they had won.

It was only at that moment that they realized that they had lost. Furthermore, they’d lost from the very beginning.

“Lord Clan Chief, I know my wrongs, I know my wrongs. Please give me another chance.”

Suddenly, Chu Haoyan’s grandfather, that Chu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder, actually started to tear up, and began to kowtow and beg for forgiveness.

He had no choice but to beg for forgiveness. After all, everything he had done had been witnessed by their Lord Clan Chief. He simply had no chance to refute anything. Only by begging for forgiveness could he still have a chance to live.

“Humph, you know your wrongs?”

“Would our Chu Heavenly Clan’s two people of the younger generation that were killed be revived just because you know your wrongs?”

“If the one that entered the Yin Yang Gate to save Chu Feng wasn’t this old man, but was instead actually Youyuan, it would not only be those two people of the younger generation that would have been killed by you all. Youyuan and Chu Feng would have also been killed.”

“Our Chu Heavenly Clan’s talents would all end up being killed by the two of you! Yet, you still have the nerve to tell me that you know your wrongs?!” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shouted furiously. His voice resounded through heaven and earth. His anger could be felt by everyone present.

“Lord Clan Chief, this was all my idea, I will bear the consequences of my actions alone. Please spare Zhiyuan, please spare Zhiyuan.”

Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather also started to kowtow and beg for forgiveness to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

That said, compared to Chu Haoyan’s grandfather, Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather did not plead for leniency for himself. Instead, he was pleading for leniency for his grandson, Chu Zhiyuan.

“Do not bother with superfluous words. You will all definitely receive severe punishment for what you have done.”

“That said, this matter is not up for this old man to decide. Instead, Chu Feng will be the one to decide your punishment.”

After saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, how do you wish to handle them?”

“What? This...” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Hearing those words, the crowd were all startled.

If the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had ordered the execution of those two Supreme Elders, no one would voice any objections.

After all, he was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s ruler. According to the laws of the Chu Heavenly Clan, he possessed the authority to punish practically anyone.

However, Chu Feng was merely a person of the younger generation. How could he be qualified to punish the two Supreme Elders?

Seemingly knowing that the crowd was feeling displeased by it, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shouted loudly, “Who will dare to object to the intention of this old man?!”

Once his shout was heard, it was not only those that were displeased with his decision, even those that weren’t displeased were startled and afraid. Apart from Chu Hanpeng, all of the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen uniformly kneeled on the ground.

“Lord Clan Chief, please excuse this old man for speaking forthrightly.”

“The crimes that the two of them have committed should be punished with execution. However, taking into consideration that they have made many contributions to our clan, I feel that it would be better to spare their lives,” Chu Hanpeng said. He was actually asking for forgiveness for the two Supreme Elders.

“Chu Hanpeng, I have already said it. This old man will not decide what to do with them. Instead, Chu Feng will be the one to decide their punishment.”

“If Chu Feng wants them to live, they will live today. If Chu Feng wants them to die, they will die today.”

“This is the promise that I made Chu Feng, that I would retrieve justice for him.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng.

Justice. It turned out that this was the justice that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had promised Chu Feng.

It was indeed justice.

That said, when faced with this sort of justice, Chu Feng felt very conflicted.

Chu Feng had been in contact with Chu Youyuan for some time now. During this period of time, Chu Feng had formed a very good impression of him.

Perhaps because he had been journeying with Chu Youyuan for a relatively long time, Chu Feng truly started feeling affection for this senior of his.

And at that moment, Chu Feng found out that the person he was associating with the entire time was not Chu Youyuan.

Instead, it was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Back then, wasn’t it precisely that Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief that expelled his father and him?

Wasn’t it the same Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief that left the imprint of ‘trash’ on their foreheads?

Wasn’t it the same Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief that imprisoned his father and him in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area?

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief should be the person Chu Feng detested the most, the person he wanted to kill the most.

Yet at present, Chu Feng was unable to feel any hatred toward the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

The reason for that was because after getting along with him, Chu Feng discovered that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was actually a genial and impartial senior.

In fact, even before Chu Feng returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had already secretly helped him gain another level of cultivation.

That’s right. Chu Feng had originally thought the illusion to be a coincidence. However, Chu Feng was now certain that the illusion should have been created by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Chu Feng, I know that you are feeling very wronged. This old man is also guilty of the injustice that you’ve received. If you want, you can punish this old man too. That said, I still hope that you will spare their lives,” at that moment, Chu Hanpeng clasped his fist and bowed respectfully to Chu Feng.

It would appear that Chu Hanpeng truly did not wish for Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather and Chu Haoyan’s grandfather to die. Otherwise, someone of his status would not plead for leniency from a person of the younger generation like Chu Feng.

Faced with Chu Hanpeng’s plea, Chu Feng waved his arm and said, “Senior, let us put this matter aside for now. We can discuss it later.”

“Put it aside?”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the expressions of many people present changed. They revealed surprise and confusion.

As matters stood, the whole truth was already revealed. Chu Feng had never harmed their Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

Instead, he was a victim. The ones that had harmed Chu Feng were Chu Zhiyuan, Chu Ruoshi and two of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders.

According to the crowd’s understanding of Chu Feng, forced to suffer this sort of grievance and being presented the opportunity to punish the criminals, Chu Feng should bring the death penalty upon them.

As such, why would Chu Feng ask for the matter to be put aside for now?

This was not like Chu Feng’s character at all.

At the moment when the crowd were confused, Chu Feng said, “I know that many people are unable to understand why I am not punishing them right away.”

“Actually, it’s very simple. It’s because punishing them is not what I want to do the most right now.”

“Not what you want to do the most right now?” The crowd were even more confused upon hearing Chu Feng’s words.

“Right now, what I want to do the most is not to fight amongst our clan. Instead, it is to defend against foreign enemies.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng turned to the the Li Heavenly Clan’s war chariot.

“This...”

At that moment, the crowd came to a sudden realization. It turned out that Chu Feng wanted to accept the Li Heavenly Clan’s challenge.

After finding out Chu Feng’s intention, the crowd’s expressions changed again. Reverence appeared in their eyes.

Ignoring how Chu Feng planned to punish the two Supreme Elders, Chu Ruoshi and Chu Zhiyuan, merely Chu Feng’s attitude of placing his personal grudges aside for the sake of the greater good, for the sake of his clan, was something worthy of respect.

Chu Feng was a true man of the Chu Heavenly Clan.
