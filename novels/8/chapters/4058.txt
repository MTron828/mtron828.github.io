Chapter 4058 - Completely Terrified

“Eeeahhh~~~”

Even more miserable screams began to resonate in the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The screams reached every corner of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, although the screams were causing a massive commotion in the Chu Heavenly Clan, the people outside the spirit formation were unable to hear them at all.

Likewise, because of Lanfu Jianpeng’s special martial power that had covered the spirit formation, the people outside were unable to see anything.

That said, the spirit formation being suddenly covered in a layer of black, the giant explosion, and the hole that appeared afterwards, had caused the crowd to be unable to keep themselves from wondering if something had happened.

As such, the outside of the Chu Heavenly Clan was also in a complete uproar.

The people from the various powers were all spiritedly discussing, analyzing, and making guesses.

Whilst all this was happening, a person was beginning to worry if something bad had happened.

......

In terms of worry, the most worried person was not someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Instead, it was Lanfu Longping.

Lanfu Jianpeng, had come to the Ancestral Martial Starfield this time around, for the sake of collecting the blue ores.

Originally, Lanfu Longping had not planned to travel to the Ancestral Martial Starfield, as he had other important matters that he needed to handle.

However, unexpectedly enough, not long after Lanfu Jianpeng had left, the news of the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect being wiped out began to spread.

No one knew who the ape and the monkey were.

However, having seen Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape before, Lanfu Longping had a deep impression of them.

Upon learning what had happened to the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect, he immediately realized that things were bad.

Although the Nine Souls Galaxy was separated from the Holy Light Galaxy by the vast starry sky, Wuming Doutian had always reported back to them in a timely manner. In his reports, he would always include the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s current state of affairs.

They’d recently received Wuming Doutian’s latest report.

The report had informed Lanfu Longping, and Lanfu Jianpeng of Chu Xuanyuan’s son’s return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and had revealed his talent.

At the same time, it also informed them of the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s rebellion, as well as Chu Xuanyuan’s death.

Lanfu Jianpeng had always considered the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to be ants.

Thus, after receiving the latest report from Wuming Doutian, he declared that he would properly take care of the Chu Heavenly Clan, and the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Originally, Lanfu Longping had not shown much concern for this. After all, if Chu Xuanyuan had died, even if Lanfu Jianpeng were to truly overstep his bounds, it would not matter.

After all, the mission the two of them had been tasked with, was to ensure that the Wuming Clan maintained control over the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Starfield Master Realm, and continue to extract the blue ores for them until all the ores had been mined.

It was not only Lanfu Jianpeng who did not care about the life and death of other people; even Lanfu Longping did not care.

Simply no one, would’ve imagined that not long after Lanfu Jianpeng had left for the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Lanfu Longping would learn of the news of a man and an ape, bringing ruin to the extremely powerful, Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect.

Furthermore, after he made inquiries about the man and ape, he learned that they greatly resembled Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape.

Because of that, Lanfu Longping panicked.

Both him and Lanfu Jianpeng were only minor characters, nobodies even, in the Blue Talisman Clan.

If they were to truly offend Chu Xuanyuan, who had already grown extremely powerful. Them wiping out the Chu Heavenly Clan would not only ensure that their clan was wiped out; the two of them would also definitely suffer greatly because of their actions.

Even if their Blue Talisman Clan was able to escape the calamity of death, the two of them would definitely be killed.

That was why he’d decided to set aside the things he needed to do, and rush over to the Ancestral Martial Starfield, so that he could warn Lanfu Jianpeng.

Unfortunately, he’d still been a step too late.

Lanfu Jianpeng had not only set off to wipe out the Chu Heavenly Clan, but Chu Xuanyuan’s son also just happened to be within the Chu Heavenly Clan at the time.

This news completely terrified him.

In order to prevent Lanfu Jianpeng from causing a disaster, not only did Lanfu Longping go all-out in his pursuit, but he even went as far as to use a forbidden technique to ignite his bloodline and damage his own soul so that he could increase his speed.

Lanfu Longping had also been using his special observation method to look ahead of him the entire time.

Finally, when he and Wuming Doutian came very close to the Chu Heavenly Clan...

“Damn it! Damn it!”

Lanfu Longping stopped all of a sudden. Not only that, but he also cursed out loud in fury.

“Lord Longping, what’s wrong?”

Seeing Lanfu Longping acting like that, Wuming Doutian was completely confused.

He didn’t understand why Lanfu Longping would suddenly stop when they were so close to reaching the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Too late, it’s already too late. We didn’t make it in time.”

“That idiot Lanfu Jianpeng has already sealed the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“With his strength, he must’ve slaughtered the entire Chu Heavenly Clan by now.”

After saying those words, Lanfu Longping suddenly grabbed Wuming Doutian’s shoulders with his hands.

His gaze became extremely fierce.

This was the first time that Wuming Doutian had seen Lanfu Longping show such a fierce appearance.

Compared to Lanfu Jianpeng, Lanfu Longping had always been a relatively good-natured person.

Not only did he not put on an air of arrogance, but he was also very easy to speak to.

However, when Wuming Doutian saw Lanfu Longping’s currently fierce gaze, he suddenly realized that the Lanfu Longping he knew was a facade.

The terrifying existence before him was the actual Lanfu Longping.

In an extremely stern manner and with an extremely threatening tone, Lanfu Longping said, “Wuming Doutian.”

“The Chu Heavenly Clan has been wiped out.”

“However, this matter has nothing to do with both you and me.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“This is all Lanfu Jianpeng’s doing.”

“You... must bear witness to this.”

Hearing those words, Wuming Doutian finally realized why Lanfu Longping was acting like that.

He was afraid...

He was afraid of Chu Xuanyuan, afraid that he would come for revenge.

That was why he wanted to shift all responsibility. He was so afraid that he did not even dare to enter the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Milord, I will definitely testify for you.”

“You’ve always treated everyone very well, and are not someone who tries to do things through force.”

“Back then, when Chu Xuanyuan returned, Lord Jianpeng had wanted to personally take care of him. Milord, it was because of your dissuasion that we managed to stop him.”

“ Looking at things from this perspective, you can be considered to be Chu Xuanyuan’s benefactor.”

“Besides, what happened here today had nothing to do with you to begin with. It is all Lord Jianpeng’s personal doing.”

“This subordinate will definitely testify for milord.”

“But... Lord Longping, what if Lord Jianpeng still hasn’t massacred the Chu Heavenly Clan?”

“It’s better that we go in and have a look. If he still hasn’t begun his massacre, we can stop him from making this enormous mistake.”

“Even if he has committed this huge blunder already, this subordinate will still be able to prove milord’s innocence,” said Wuming Doutian.

“Right, what you say is very correct.”

“I was muddle headed, muddle headed,” Lanfu Longping said repeatedly.

Seeing Lanfu Longping like that, Wuming Doutian sighed in his heart.

He knew that it wasn’t that Lanfu Longping was muddle-headed. Rather, he was truly too terrified.

He was terrified of Chu Xuanyuan.

After coming to a decision, Lanfu Longping brought Wuming Doutian with him and continued on towards the Chu Heavenly Clan.

For the sake of not causing any commotion, he did not directly breach the Chu Heavenly Clan’s protective formation like Lanfu Jianpeng had.

Instead, he used his abilities to carefully tear apart the spirit formation and secretly make his way inside.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

However, right after Lanfu Longping and Wuming Doutian passed through the Chu Heavenly Clan’s protective formation, and Lanfu Jianpeng’s power that had sealed it, they were met with screams.

Hearing the screams, Lanfu Longping and Wuming Doutian’s hearts immediately tensed up.

What they were worried about the most had occurred.

Lanfu Jianpeng had already begun.

However, they soon felt that something was amiss.

If Lanfu Jianpeng had unleashed a massacre upon the Chu Heavenly Clan, how could they only hear the screams of a single person?

Furthermore, the strong reek of blood that is expected from a massacre, was nowhere to be found. Instead, many living auras could be sensed.

Most importantly, Lanfu Longping thought the screams sounded like Lanfu Jianpeng’s voice!
