Chapter 3238 - Spouting Nonsense

“Four hours?” Chu Feng was unable to determine what the hidden implication of Linghu Lun’s words were. Instead, he spoke disapprovingly and in a provocative manner, “Even if you’re given an entire lifetime’s worth of time, you will still not be able to do anything to me.”

“Linghu Lun, I’d urge you this. Do not follow me. Otherwise... your Symbol of Light will also be snatched away by me.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he waved his sleeve. Chu Huanyu, Chu Haoyan and everyone from the Li Heavenly Clan were all brought over to him.Then, Chu Feng soared into the sky. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Once he did that, the raging flames immediately soared into the sky too.

It was simply not a single person or a group of people moving. Instead, an enormous sea of flames were galloping in midair.

As the flames moved, the earth and sky were all burned by the flames. The flames were so powerful that they were able to set his entire surroundings ablaze.

“Arrogant bastard! You dare to make wild talk about depriving me of my Symbol of Light?! Very well, I shall see how you will snatch away my Symbol of Light!” Linghu Lun cursed in rage. Then, he soared into the sky and followed Chu Feng.

Linghu Lun would naturally not allow Chu Feng to escape. The reason for that was because he knew that the power of Chu Feng’s Fire Qilin Armor would eventually disappear. When the power of that Fire Qilin Armor disappeared, it would be time for him to take care of Chu Feng.

However, it seemed that Chu Feng had not noticed that at all.

Chu Feng flew in the sky in a slow and unhurried manner. In fact, he was ridiculing Linghu Lun as he flew. He simply did not have any intention to break free from Linghu Lun’s pursuit. Just like that, he allowed Linghu Lun to follow him.

Seeing Chu Feng acting like that, whilst Linghu Lun appeared to still be furious, he was actually sneering in his heart.

He thought to himself, ‘Chu Feng, I will allow you to continue with your arrogance for the time being. After four hours have passed, I’ll have you kneel before me and beg for forgiveness. However... even if you are to beg me, it will still be useless.’

......

Chu Feng ‘appeared’ to have no idea what Linghu Lun was planning to do.

That said, Li Anzhi and the others were actually ignorant as to what Linghu Lun was planning to do.

At that moment, they felt that Linghu Lun was truly ridiculous. They felt that he was a clown being enraged by Chu Feng, yet having no way to deal with him. They found Linghu Lun to be truly laughable and lamentable.

That said, they were even more astonished by Chu Feng’s power.

Before this, they had never imagined that they would be saved, and be saved by Chu Feng on top of that.

“Chu Feng, it would appear that I owe you another favor,” Li Anzhi said.

“I also owe you a favor.”

“I as well.”

After Li Anzhi spoke, the other Li Heavenly Clansmen also echoed his words.

Even Li Tianyou, who deeply detested Chu Feng, expressed his thanks to him.

As the saying went, everyone’s heart is made of flesh. Although it was a fact that they were defeated at Chu Feng’s hands, it was also a fact that Chu Feng had saved them.

One should be able to conduct oneself with integrity and distinguish between gratitude and grudges. Although those Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were conceited, arrogant and sometimes completely unreasonable, they had not yet reached the point of being unable to distinguish right from wrong.

Thus, they remembered the grace that Chu Feng had shown them.

“If you all truly feel that you owe me a favor, your Li Heavenly Clan should not invade our Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory,” Chu Feng said.

“That is not something that we can decide,” Li Anzhi said.

“In that case, it would mean that your Li Heavenly Clan is determined to invade our Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, I do not wish to lie to you. Our Li Heavenly Clan will not let this opportunity escape us. Thus, I’d urge your Chu Heavenly Clan to prepare yourselves. Rather than putting up a meaningless resistance, it’s better that we reach a compromise,” Li Anzhi said.

“That matter is also not something that I can decide. However, our Chu Heavenly Clan will definitely not let our hands be tied and wait for your Li Heavenly Clan to capture us. We will also not choose to reach a compromise with you.”

“Thus, I will also urge you all this. Don’t underestimate our Chu Heavenly Clan. If you all truly decide to invade us, your Li Heavenly Clan must prepare yourselves for a crushing defeat,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, even if you’ve saved us, I am still unable to tolerate you making that sort of boastful claim,” Li Tianyou said.

“You will know whether or not I am boasting when the time arrives,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Just like that, Chu Feng and the others continued to chat as they traveled past countless mountains, plains and rivers.

Suddenly, Chu Huanyu’s expression changed. Nervously, he asked, “Chu Feng, why did you come to this place?”

The reason why Chu Huanyu asked that was because the location where Chu Feng flew to was the location where they had been captured.

If he guessed correctly, Chu Feng was planning to fly toward that spirit formation entrance.

However, that spirit formation evidently contained some sort of secret. As for that secret... it was not something that Linghu Lun should know about.

“I have done so deliberately,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Hearing those words, Chu Huanyu’s expression changed. Then, he asked no more.

Although he had no idea what Chu Feng’s goal was, he knew that, based on his understanding of Chu Feng, that he was not someone who would do something that would bring a disadvantage upon himself. Thus, Chu Huanyu felt that Chu Feng must have a plan in mind.

Just like that, Chu Feng quickly dived into the depths of the sea. Chu Qing and Chu Shuangshuang were still inside the deep sea.

Without saying anything, Chu Feng directly brought Chu Qing and Chu Shuangshuang along with him and dove toward the spirit formation entrance.

The first time Chu Feng had entered the spirit formation, he did not allow Chu Qing and the others to follow him because he did not know what dangers were contained in the spirit formation entrance.

However, Chu Feng was now familiar with the spirit formation entrance. Thus, even though he was bringing them with him, he was able to ingeniously avoid the various traps.

“There’s actually a spirit formation entrance here? Is it a trap that Chu Feng had prepared for me? No wonder he was so confident the entire way here.”

“Humph. No matter what sort of shenanigans you have in mind, you won’t be able to shake me off today.”

“You, trash that can only act arrogant through the power of a treasure, will definitely be taken care of by me.”

Seeing that Chu Feng had entered the spirit formation entrance with the surging flames, Linghu Lun hesitated slightly.

However, that hesitation of his only lasted for a split second. Soon, Linghu Lun set off again, and followed Chu Feng into the spirit formation entrance.

With Linghu Lun’s speed, he soon caught up to Chu Feng after entering the spirit formation entrance.

However, not long after Linghu Lun entered the spirit formation entrance, his expression changed enormously as an astonished expression filled his eyes.
