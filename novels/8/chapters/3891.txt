Chapter 3891 - Experiencing Backlash

Chu Feng had returned to the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb with the Mystic Cave Saints.

He had returned the Mystic Cave Saints’ treasures to them.

This included the treasures that the Mystic Cave Saints had plundered from the All-heaven Sect.

“Brother Asura, so you’re actually still alive. Furthermore, you’ve obtained the spirit formation’s power, and in even greater measure than our own.”

“It would appear that brother Asura was correct. We were the ones mistaken.”

The Mystic Cave Saints were all extremely excited.

If it wasn’t for Chu Feng’s appearance, they would all have been killed by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted. Chu Feng had saved them.

Thus, they were extremely happy that Chu Feng had decided to take the other gate. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

If he hadn’t done that, he wouldn’t have obtained the power of that enormously powerful spirit formation and would not have been able to rescue them.

“In the end, it’s brother Asura that’s reliable. The YinYang Guidance Lamps were simply unreliable trash.”

“No, that shouldn’t be the case. If the YinYang Guidance Lamps were unreliable, the gate we entered should have been the death gate. We shouldn’t have been able to exit it alive, much less obtain the spirit formation’s power." someone said while the other Mystic Cave Saints were complaining.

“That’s true. That does seem to be the case.”

“...but brother Asura also came out alive.”

“Not only did he come out alive, but he even obtained an even greater amount of the spirit formation’s power than us.”

“Exactly what is going on here?”

The Mystic Cave Saints became even more confused.

Confused, they all turned their gazes to Chu Feng.

Only Chu Feng could clarify their confusion.

“The YinYang Guidance Lamps were actually correct. The gate you all entered was the life gate, whereas the one I entered was the death gate.”

“However, whilst it was a death gate, it was not a gate of certain death. If one could solve the death gate, one would be able to obtain the true inheritance." said Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, in that case, it would mean that you’ve obtained the true inheritance?” asked the Mystic Cave Saints.

Chu Feng smiled, and did not answer the question.

He didn’t want to burden the Mystic Cave Saints. Thus, he didn’t plan to tell them the truth.

“Wuuu~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng grabbed his chest, and a look of pain filled his face. Then, he sat down powerlessly on the ground, and his body began to twitch violently.

The energy armor that had enveloped Chu Feng also began to dissipate.

The Mystic Cave Saints were able to clearly witness how ugly Chu Feng’s current complexion was.

Chu Feng’s sudden change brought great alarm to the Mystic Cave Saints.

They immediately arrived before him and began to diagnose his condition. Upon doing so, they discovered that Chu Feng’s health was extremely weak, his bones were all shattered, and his veins were all fractured. His condition was akin to someone experiencing a backlash from taking forbidden medicines.

“Brother Asura, what’s happening to you?”

“Did you eat something bad? Why did you suddenly become like this?”

The Mystic Cave Saints started asking Chu Feng what had happened whilst treating his injuries.

“That Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted is simply too powerful. I was unable to defeat him with my power alone. Without any choice, I decided to overdraft my power and, with the price of a backlash, suppress him.”

“That is why this is happening.”

“I originally thought that I would be able to kill him. Unfortunately, he escaped." said Chu Feng weakly.

“Ah? The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted didn’t die? I thought he had died.”

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, the Mystic Cave Saints were very shocked and pained.

They were shocked that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had been able to escape from Chu Feng’s fierce attacks.

They were shocked by the abilities of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

However, compared to their shock, they felt more pained. They felt pained that Chu Feng did not hesitate to harm himself for the sake of saving them.

“It’s alright. It’s merely a backlash. It’s nothing serious.”

“The eleven of you are ugly to begin with, so don’t make that sort of agrieved look. It’s truly... too ugly." Chu Feng looked to the Mystic Cave Saints with a look of disgust.

After all, the Mystic Cave Saints’ true appearances were exposed at that moment.

“You stinky little brat, you actually resent us for being ugly?”

“Since you’re our brother, you’re not going to be much better looking than us either.”

“Right. Even if we’re ugly, we’re at least distinguishably ugly. As for you, you simply look beyond plain.”

The Mystic Cave Saints were truly shameless. They actually began to insult Chu Feng’s looks.

Chu Feng did not refute them. After all, he was currently using Asura’s appearance, and not his own.

Asura’s appearance was indeed extremely plain, and possessed no imposing qualities at all.

What the Mystic Cave Saints had said was true. Plain was the best description for Asura’s looks.

Although Chu Feng had ended up losing the power of the spirit formation and had ended up suffering from a backlash after forcibly taking on the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, the Mystic Cave Saints were, no matter what, quite capable.

With their help, Chu Feng’s condition began to change for the better.

“Brother Asura, according to you, you should’ve obtained even more powerful inheritances.”

“Exactly what sort of treasures did you obtain? Tell us about it.”

After seeing that Chu Feng’s condition was kept under control, the Mystic Cave Saints became curious.

Before Chu Feng could say anything, an aged voice was heard. “He didn’t obtain nearly as many treasures as you all.”

Following that voice, a figure appeared beside them.

“Who are you?!”

The Mystic Cave Saints were immediately startled by this person who had suddenly appeared.

After all, they’d just confronted someone as fierce as the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, and were still feeling lingering fear.

And suddenly, someone unknown had appeared out of thin air. They would naturally be on guard and afraid.

“Senior, what brought you here?”

Seeing the person before him, Chu Feng was also surprised.

After all, that person was the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s remnant soul.

The Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s remnant soul should be staying in that dusky palace hall. That was the reason why Chu Feng was surprised to see him there.

However, upon thinking about it, since the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb belonged to him anyways, it would not be surprising for him to appear there. Chu Feng was the one that was making a fuss about nothing.

Although the surprise had disappeared from Chu Feng’s eyes, the Mystic Cave Saints became extremely curious.

“Brother Asura, you know this person?” The Mystic Cave Saints asked Chu Feng.

“He is the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.” replied Chu Feng.

“Great Monster Slayer Emperor?!”

Even the Mystic Cave Saints felt deep veneration upon hearing that title.

After all, they knew better than Chu Feng what sort of person the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was.

“We pay our respects to Great Emperor.”

In the next instant, the Mystic Cave Saints uniformly knelt to the ground.

Compared to Chu Feng’s bow and clasp of his fist, the Mystic Cave Saints actually knelt directly, and were even on both knees.

This was the first time Chu Feng had seen the Mystic Cave Saints showing such respect towards someone.

“This old man is merely a remnant soul. I cannot accept such a great display of respect.”

The Great Monster Slayer Emperor let out a faint smile. Then, he waved his arm, and a gentle power directly helped the Mystic Cave Saints back to their feet.

“We truly never imagined that we’d be able to witness the legendary Great Monster Slayer Emperor during our lifetimes. Even if I am to die now, I will not have any regrets.”

“According to my knowledge, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor is someone of imperious might. Truly never would I have imagined that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor is even more outstanding than I’d imagined.”

The Mystic Cave Saints were all praising the Great Monster Slayer Emperor nonstop. Adoration filled their little eyes.

However, hearing those words, Chu Feng felt something was amiss.

How come they seemed to be boot-licking the Great Monster Slayer Emperor?
