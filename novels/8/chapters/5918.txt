Chapter 5919: Slaughter All of Them

“You seem to be fond of running your mouth.”

Chu Feng grabbed Tan Yu’s sister and smashed a punch into her face. Her nose twisted, her teeth rattled in her mouth, and blood splattered everywhere. She winced in pain.

Even so, she still shouted, “Big brother, save me!”

She was smart. Even their strongest old ancestor had kneeled. No one else in the sect could save her anymore. Her only hope was her foolish big brother.

But before Tan Yu could say a word, Chu Feng interjected, “Tan Yu, she disrespected my lover. This is no longer a matter between the two of you.”

Chu Feng emanated a cold aura that seeped into everyone’s soul, letting them vividly sense his killing intent. The crowd felt like they had been plunged into hell, and Chu Feng was its ruler.

This killing intent was made known to not just those from the Sunmoon Sect but Tan Yu too.

Tan Yu looked at Chu Feng and said, “Milord, it was unfortunate for such a black sheep to emerge from my family. She was the one who landed me in my current plight. She deserves to die for showing disrespect to you. I’ll only be grateful no matter how you punish her.”

Tan Yu’s little sister quickly turned her eyes to her husband for help instead, but the latter, despite being the sectmaster’s grandson, dropped to his knees and burst into tears.

“Milord, she’s an outsider to me! She was the one who drugged and urged me to deal with Tan Yu. To display her loyalty to our Sunmoon Sect, she even personally dug out her big brother’s dantian. It was due to her inability to do it properly that we couldn’t graft Tan Yu’s bloodline over for me to use.

“I know that I have done wrong too, but that’s because she seduced me! She is the true culprit behind that incident! Milord, please severely punish her!” the sectmaster’s grandson exclaimed with a tearful voice as if he were the victim.

Tan Yu’s little sister was baffled. She never thought that her husband would reveal such a face in this life-and-death situation when she had stooped down to harming her big brother for him. Tears began flowing from her face.

She didn’t cry when Chu Feng smashed her face, but her husband’s coldness made her burst into tears.

However, these were just crocodile’s tears. She was upset because she had been hurt, not because she was regretting having hurt her big brother.

Thus, Chu Feng didn’t change his mind because of her tears. Rather, an idea came to his mind. Physical torture means nothing to such people. Punishing her psychologically will let her better understand her crimes, as well as the harm she has inflicted on others.

So, Chu Feng manifested a formation dagger and passed it to the sectmaster’s grandson, saying. “Go and dig out her dantian.”

However, the sectmaster’s grandson pushed the dagger back to Chu Feng.

The old ancestor and the sectmaster were furious to see that.

“You bastard! Listen to milord’s words and cripple that wrench!”

They believed that they had to obey Chu Feng’s will and satisfy whatever tendencies he had. Perhaps when Chu Feng was satisfied, he might just lose interest and spare their lives.

However, the sectmaster’s grandson shook his head.

Tan Yu’s little sister burst into tears. Is his earlier coldness feigned? Does he still love me?

Just then, the sectmaster’s grandson said, “Milord, the dagger you manifested on a whim might be worthless to you, but it’s no different from a sacred treasure. It’d be blasphemy if we get that wrench’s blood on your dagger. My dagger will suffice here.”

The sectmaster’s grandson stood up and whipped out a dagger from his Cosmos Sack.

Grabbing the shoulder of Tan Yu’s little sister with his left hand, he plunged the dagger into her. As Tan Yu’s little sister shrieked in agony, he twisted the dagger around to mess her up. When he finally pulled out the dagger, there was a glowing little sphere attached to it.

He was skilled in it! He must have often dug out other people’s dantians, or else his movements wouldn’t have been so smooth.

“Milord.” The sectmaster’s grandson kneeled on the floor and raised his hands high, presenting his wife’s dantian to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng glanced at Tan Yu’s little sister, whose face was warped from the excruciating pain but was no longer able to make a sound. She must have realized the pain her big brother felt back then by now. Since that’s the case, I should send her on her way.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng flicked his wrist, and the formation dagger in his grasp pierced through the throat of Tan Yu’s little sister. The latter plummeted to the ground, dead.

He had her husband dig out her dantian to exact vengeance for Tan Yu, and he claimed her life because she insulted Zi Ling.

“Reveal the names of those who were involved in Tan Yu’s crippling back then,” Chu Feng ordered the sectmaster’s grandson.

The sectmaster’s grandson was scared out of his wits. He unhesitatingly crippled his wife, who had devoted herself to him, and didn’t even shed a tear afterward. This showed how callous he was.

Thus, he recited a list of names in a single breath. Most of them, elders and disciples, had a high standing in the Sunmoon Sect, and they were present here today.

They knew that it was unlikely for them to survive this ordeal, but they still stepped out and kneeled on the floor when their names were called. They pleaded desperately for mercy. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They could tell that Chu Feng was vicious, so they secretly pleaded with Tan Yu instead.

Tan Yu wavered. The main culprits behind this matter were the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster and his grandson, as well as his little sister. The others only played an auxiliary role.

Some of them had only hurled insults at him back then; it was possible that they didn’t even know the truth.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng exerted his oppressive might with a mere thought, and all of the kneeling individuals were reduced to blood water in an instant. He had killed all of them!

Tan Yu was flabbergasted. He looked at Chu Feng with fear in his eyes.
