Chapter 5520: Feng Tiansheng’s Challenge

“Eggy, do you think avatars may be related to the number of formations under one’s control? The more formations one has under one’s control, the faster they can complete the other formations,” Chu Feng murmured out his deduction.

“That’s probably the case,” Eggy replied.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng turned around and looked behind him. Moments later, he smiled.

“Come out,” he said.

Shoosh!

A ray of light shot forth from the distance, spreading outward to form a massive prison that trapped Chu Feng in place. At the same time, numerous individuals descended from the sky. They were Totem Phoenix Clansmen, with Feng Tiansheng leading the pack.

There were also Totem Dragon Clansmen such as Long Shanshan and Long Fulai amongst them as well, just that they were all bound by shackles. Upon seeing the situation, those who had previously entered the formation core and were preparing themselves to cultivate wanted to step out to save their brethren.

“Stay there. I’ll deal with this,” Chu Feng said with a wave of his hand, expressing that he would resolve the situation.

Those Totem Dragon Clansmen wouldn’t have made a difference even if they intervened in the situation. Even if Feng Tiansheng wasn’t around, the enemy was still beyond their means to deal with.

“Let’s see how you’re going to flee now, Chu Feng!” Feng Tiansheng sneered.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He was much more confident this time around. He had already sealed off the surroundings to prevent Chu Feng from escaping using his treasure.

“Are you a fool? Do I look like I’m going to escape?” Chu Feng asked.

“Are you planning to surrender?” Feng Tiansheng asked.

“Heh…” Chu Feng revealed a disdainful smile.

While he had to admit that Feng Tiansheng was a rather talented cultivator, it looked like he didn’t have a good head.

“This is all your fault,” Feng Tiansheng said as he pointed at the avatar above his head.

There were phoenix avatars above the Totem Phoenix Clansmen’s heads, but they were nowhere as clear as those above the Totem Dragon Clansmen’s heads.

“They wouldn’t have received such a huge advantage if not for your help,” Feng Tiansheng said.

“Isn’t your lack of social skills the reason no one wants to help you?” Chu Feng asked.

Feng Tiansheng clicked his tongue in annoyance. “It doesn’t matter whether I have good social skills or not. I have plenty of friends, but none of them are like you.”

“Is that fellow… complimenting you?” Eggy was surprised.

Chu Feng was rendered speechless too, for it sounded like a compliment to him too.

“Chu Feng, I have a high opinion of you. I believe we can become good friends if you’re willing to join our side,” Feng Tiansheng said.

That confirmed Chu Feng’s suspicion that Feng Tiansheng was indeed complimenting him.

“I have already told you that Long Chengyu and Long Muxi are my friends. I don’t turn my back on my friends,” Chu Feng replied.

“Are you really that sentimental of a person?”

Shoosh!

Feng Tiansheng waved his sleeves. Several chains shot out and wrapped themselves tightly around Long Shanshan, Long Fulai, and the others’ necks. Their faces immediately scrunched in pain. At this rate, they would lose their lives.

“Aren’t you a sentimental person, Chu Feng? You won’t turn a blind eye to their plights, right?” Feng Tiansheng asked as he grasped the chains suffocating Long Shanshan and the others.

“Feng Tiansheng, I suggest you stop what you are doing right now before I make a move. Apologize to them, and I can treat it as if nothing has happened. Otherwise, you’ll pay the price.” Chu Feng’s eyes turned cold.

After his recent breakthroughs, he didn’t fear Feng Tiansheng anymore.

“I’ll pay the price? Hahaha! What rights do you have to say those words to me, Chu Feng? You might be a fast runner, but how are you going to run away from here?” Feng Tiansheng laughed.

“You think that you have trapped me here?” Chu Feng chuckled in disdain.

Lightning crackled around his body as he hurled a fist upward.

Boom!

The barrier surrounding Chu Feng immediately collapsed.

“That fellow!”

The crowd was stunned.

Chu Feng was able to easily shatter the barrier because his cultivation had risen to rank six Half-God level, but more than that, he was bearing the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and a pair of gigantic Lightning Wings too!

In other words, he was able to raise his cultivation by three ranks despite being at Half-God level!

“My gosh! Young hero Chu Feng is too incredible! There is hardly anyone with the Heavenly Bloodline who can use Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor in Half-God level, and he’s able to use Lightning Wings on top of that!” the Totem Dragon Clansmen exclaimed in shock.

Even Long Shanshan and the others, despite being suffocated by a chain, showed looks of delight. They knew that there was hope for them. Chu Feng, in his current state, would surely be able to stand up against Feng Tiansheng!

“That explains why you were able to run that fast. You have indeed been hiding your cultivation. Very well, allow me to taste your means then. Chu Feng, do you dare to fight with me?” Feng Tiansheng asked as he released the chains around Long Shanshan and the others’ necks before pointing a finger at Chu Feng.

“What do I have to fear?” Chu Feng sneered.

“If you lose, you’ll have to help our Totem Phoenix Clan complete the formations here,” Feng Tiansheng said.

“And if you lose, you have to apologize to my friends, and I’ll be taking those avatars above your heads,” Chu Feng replied.

“Hahaha!” Feng Tiansheng burst into laughter.

Putting aside the fact that those avatars were intangible and couldn’t be taken away, he didn’t think that he would lose to Chu Feng in the first place.

“Very well. I’ll accept your bet,” Feng Tiansheng replied.

“Let them go. I’ll play with you,” Chu Feng said as he drew the Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

Feng Tiansheng waved his sleeves, and the chains binding Long Shanshan and the others shattered, returning them to their freedom. The lot of them quickly ran toward Chu Feng’s side.

Chu Feng opened up the formation core and said, “You head in first.”

Long Shanshan and the others didn’t want to be a burden to Chu Feng, so they quickly headed into the formation core, knowing that it was safe inside. Even so, they didn’t start cultivating but instead kept their eyes on the events outside.
