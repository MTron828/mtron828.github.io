MGA: Chapter 1188 - Allow Me

“Chu Feng, don’t act impulsively.” Seeing this scene, the expressions of all those people who possessed good relations with Chu Feng changed greatly. They began to secretly send Chu Feng voice transmissions to try to urge him against it. That was because this oath that Chu Feng had made was truly too deadly.

In fact, after Chu Feng swore upon the heavens, not to mention those who were worried about him, even those who possessed absolutely no relationship with him were shocked.

After all, what had just happened could not be changed. Using merely the words from his mouth, it was impossible for Chu Feng to confirm the validity of the things he had said. Even if they believed Chu Feng, there was nothing that Chu Feng could do about the elders from the Orion Monastery firmly rejecting all that he said and declaring them to be lies.

As for having Chu Feng show proof, how could he possibly be able to show proof? Could it be that he would have to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle once again?

However, the energy within the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond was extremely fierce. Other than the moment when it was opened by the Ancient Era’s Elves every year, it was extremely difficult for one to reach the deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. With even ordinary Ancient Era’s Elves being incapable of reaching the deepest region, there was less of a need to mention how difficult it would be for ordinary humans.

Thus, the majority of the people present believed that Chu Feng might have truly triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, as the energy of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond at that time would be the weakest and Chu Feng possessed the capability of triggering it.

However, if Chu Feng was to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle now, then it would be something that no one believed that he could accomplish. That was because, right now, the energy of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond was extremely frightening.

Even the Cyanwood Mountain’s demon-level geniuses would only stay in the upper water level when training in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, not daring to enter deep into it, much less diving into the deepest region.

In that case, if Chu Feng was incapable of triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle right now, then how must he prove that it was him that had triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle last time around?

There was practically no possible way for Chu Feng to prove that. Thus, everyone felt that Chu Feng was acting too impulsively, and to swear upon the heavens with his own death was simply equivalent to pressing himself into a dead end.

Compared to the others, that elder from the Orion Monastery had an expression of complacence. He felt that the control of the situation, which had been taken from them by Chu Feng, had now been regained.

“Ha, you’ve finally lost your appearance of calmness and entered a state of confusion? I bet you’re going to force me to swear upon the heavens with my own life afterwards, right? That’s fine, I’ll take you on, little bastard. I will continue to insist that all everything you said are lies, I shall see what you will do then.”

“You are definitely going to die today. However, it is not that I am trying to kill you. Instead, it is you who have courted death. Fight with me? You’re still too inexperienced!” cursed that elder from the Orion Monastery in his heart.

Sure enough, after Chu Feng swore his oath, he turned to that elder and asked, “Elder, I, Chu Feng, have already sworn upon the heavens. This is the way that I will take responsibility for the words that I have spoken. Elder from the Orion Monastery, what will you do? Do you also dare to take responsibility for your words?”

“Of course I dare,” That elder from the Orion Monastery smiled complacently.

After that, he raised his hand high up toward the sky and loudly said, “I firmly believe in Yuan Qing’s character. The person that obtained the Commander Flag and triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is, without a doubt, Yuan Qing. If this Chu Feng is capable of proving that the person who triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is not Yuan Qing, and was instead him, then I have most definitely misjudged, I am blind beyond help and have wrongly accused Chu Feng. If that is the case, then I am unfit to continue to live and will kill myself.”

“Well then, Chu Feng, I’ve already sworn upon the heavens. How are you going to prove that it was you that triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle now?” After swearing his oath, that Orion Monastery’s elder looked at Chu Feng with a beaming smile.

“No, it would not be enough with only you. Earlier, it was more than just you that declared that they firmly believed in Yuan Qing, and were willing to vouch for him with their own dignity.”

“Since you all believe in Yuan Qing this much, then elders, do you all dare to swear upon the heavens too?” To his surprise, Chu Feng once again made things difficult. Chu Feng cast his gaze toward the other elders, all of whom were Half Martial Emperors.

“This...”

Once Chu Feng said those words, not to mention that the expressions of the elders from the Orion Monastery changed greatly, even the crowd was unable to help themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

That was because Chu Feng was truly too ruthless. It was one thing for him to swear an oath himself, but he actually wanted to force all of the Half Martial Emperor-level elders from the Orion Monastery to swear upon the heavens.

It would be one thing if Chu Feng failed to provide everybody with ample proof that what he had said was the truth. However, if he was able to provide the proof, then wouldn’t it mean that all of these Half Martial Emperor-level elders from the Orion Monastery would have to kill themselves on the spot?

These Half Martial Emperor-level elders could be said to be the true backbone of the Orion Monastery in the Cyanwood Mountain. If they were to die, then Chu Feng’s action this time around could be said to be equivalent to the ruthless extermination of the Orion Monastery’s elders in the Cyanwood Mountain

At this moment, the other elders that had vouched for Yuan Qing earlier all started to panic. They did not wish, for no reason and cause, to gamble their lives for a disciple like Yuan Qing. Thus, they did not dare to provide an answer.

“Everyone, don’t be afraid. The only way for Chu Feng to prove himself would be to trigger this place’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. However, I believe you all should know how frightening the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond is right now. Not to mention triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, he would not even be able to reach the depths of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.”

“Take him on. It is nothing more than a mere oath upon the heavens. I can guarantee you all that the one who will die in the end will be Chu Feng.”

“Come, don’t be scared. This is not only a battle for our own reputations, this is also a battle for the future of our Orion Monastery. If we do not dare to swear today, then the future of our Orion Monastery will be completely ruined by this Chu Feng. All the reputation and fame that our Orion Monastery has managed to obtain will be destroyed.”

Seeing that the other elders were hesitating, that elder who had already sworn the oath started to hurriedly send voice transmissions to the others to urge them to swear.

“Very well. An upright man is not afraid of gossip. The truth is the truth, don’t you think you can invert black and white.”

After being persuaded by that other elder, the remaining Half Martial Emperor-level elders from the Orion Monastery also began to swear upon the heavens before the crowd.

“Chu Feng, we have finished our swearing toward the heavens. Take out the proof that you did not lie. Otherwise, in accordance with the oath you’ve sworn, if you fail to provide us with proof that the words you’ve said today are the truth, then you shall kill yourself.” After swearing their oaths, the Orion Monastery’s elders were filled with grievances. One by one, they began to force Chu Feng to show his proof. They truly wished that Chu Feng would kill himself right away.

“Very well. Actually, the method to prove my words is extremely simple. As the saying goes, true gold doesn’t fear fire. Since you all firmly believe that Yuan Qing is the one that triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, then why not have Yuan Qing trigger it again?” Chu Feng took a glance at Yuan Qing who was lying on the ground and then took a glance at the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle not far away in the distance.

Hearing those words, Yuan Qing’s complexion instantly turned ash-like.[1. He went as white as a sheet or pale as dying embers.] He did not even have the courage to reply. That was because Yuan Qing knew very well that he did not possess the capability to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.

“Truly ignorant. Could it be that you do not know that even Ancient Era’s Elves that are capable of triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle would have to do it at a specific time?”

“Other than that specific time, the energies in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond are extremely powerful, so powerful that even the Ancient Era’s Elves that are born from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond could not withstand it. Thus, how could Yuan Qing possibly be able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle now?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Chu Feng, this method that you’ve proposed will not work. Even if Yuan Qing wished to prove himself, he would still have to wait till next year’s opening of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.”

“Unfortunately, you’ve sworn that you will prove that your words are the truth today. If you’re incapable of proving it, then you must fulfill your oath.”

At this moment, the elders from the Orion Monastery refuted Chu Feng. Not only did they speak with force and conviction, they also began to force Chu Feng even further.

However, the actions of the Orion Monastery’s elders were something that Chu Feng had already anticipated. Thus, he was not worried at all. Instead, he laughed lightly and said, “Very well. Since Yuan Qing is incapable of doing it, then allow me to do it. Today, I, Chu Feng, will, before everyone present here, enter into the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond and trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle that no one has ever triggered before.”

As he said those words, Chu Feng pointed his finger at the depths of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, the location of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.
