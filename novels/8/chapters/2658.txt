Chapter 2658 - New Lease Of Life

“I was afraid he would scam me. Thus, after I met him, I drew a portrait of him so that I could search for him should he have scammed me.”

“Never did I expect for all of this to be true. Never did I expect for there to actually be a Ginseng King of Evil sealed in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”

“Even in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Ginseng Kings of Evil are only legends,” Chu Bore said.

“Ginseng Kings of Evil are also legends in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?”

Chu Feng was astonished. From merely those words, Chu Bore revealed how precious the Ginseng King of Evil was.

“I have told you everything that I know. I truly did not lie to you. Please spare me,” Chu Bore said.

“You can scram,” The Evil God Sword said.

Hearing those words, Chu Bore unleashed all of his body’s strength and stood up with great difficulty. Staggeringly, he ran away.

His running speed was very slow. It was roughly the same speed as that of ordinary people.

From this, it could be seen that his injuries were truly serious, and that the Ginseng King of Evil was truly powerful.

Without a doubt, the Ginseng King of Evil truly possessed the power to completely destroy the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

At the very least, it could turn the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm into a lifeless place of desolation.

Unfortunately, it had encountered an even stronger opponent.

The Evil God Sword!!!

The Evil God Sword turned around and swept its gaze across the crowd.

When the Evil God Sword’s gaze moved toward them, practically everyone, with the exception of Ying Mingchao, Wang Qiang and a few others, did not dare to face the Evil God Sword’s eyes. They were all very afraid of that crimson figure.

While that person was not enormous in size, it was even more frightening than the Ginseng King of Evil.

“You all need to thank Chu Feng for being able to live today,” the Evil God Sword said.

“Thank Chu Feng?”

“He... he isn’t Chu Feng?”

The crowd immediately burst into an uproar upon hearing those words from the Evil God Sword.

With merely one sentence, the Evil God Sword had revealed to the crowd that it wasn’t Chu Feng.

After all, if it were Chu Feng, Chu Feng would definitely not tell the crowd to express thanks to him.

“Who are you? Whe-Where is my b-brother?” Wang Qiang asked anxiously.

As he spoke, he rushed toward the Evil God Sword.

“Haha...”

The Evil God Sword chuckled. It watched as Wang Qiang approached.

“Woosh~~~”

However, by the time Wang Qiang managed to reach the Evil God Sword, the Evil God Sword had disappeared.

Following that, the crimson clouds that filled the sky also started to dissipate.

Both the dark black gaseous flames and the crimson gaseous flames disappeared from the sky.

The blue sky and white clouds once again appeared over the crowd.

At that moment, the crowd present realized that this most commonly seen sight was actually very beautiful.

After all, to them, this was equivalent to obtaining a new lease on life.

The things that they’d experienced earlier were simply akin to entering hell itself.

In fact, the crowd was unable to be certain even now as to whether or not their calamity was truly over or not.

After a short period of time, someone said, “We... survived?”

The tone of those words was filled with skepticism. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Even they themselves were uncertain as to whether they would be able to survive.

Suddenly, someone shouted, “Run away!”

Then, a figure started to fly into the distance with an extremely fast speed. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared.

“Run!!!”

Immediately afterward, many others also began to flee in disarray.

This time around, there was no longer any power restricting them. As such, the crowd all managed to successfully escape.

Seeing that they could now escape, some people started to laugh loudly, whereas others started to cry bitterly.

All of those were reactions from obtaining a new lease on life after a great calamity.

One thing that was somewhat comedic was the fact that the old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan, that old man who once stood high and above all the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s cultivators, was currently running away with a speed less than one ten thousandth of those cultivators.

That said, even though that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan was already so very weak, not a single person dared to attack him.

After all, he was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Who would dare to kill him?

That said, there were two individuals who were not from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm witnessing all of this.

Although the two of them were hidden, they were brought over when Chu Bore completely enveloped everyone in the surrounding region with his power and proceeded to chase after the Ginseng King of Evil.

Thus, the two of them witnessed everything that happened.

“Chu Huai, let’s go help senior. Let’s bring him back to the clan,” Chu Yue said.

“If you want to die, then go do that,” Chu Huai said.

“Are you saying that senior will still try to kill us in his current state?” Chu Yue asked.

“You have already seen his true appearance. What do you think he will do?” Chu Huai said.

Chu Yue grew quiet. After a while, she asked, “Do you really think that Chu Feng has been devoured by his Demon Armament?”

“That’s most likely the case,” Chu Huai said.

“Then, will he be able to survive?” Chu Yue asked.

“Most definitely not,” Chu Huai said in a very determined manner.

“Why is that? Didn’t you say that a genius like him most definitely possesses some sort of treasure to protect his life?” Chu Yue asked.

“Can’t you tell how powerful that Demon Armament was? No matter how powerful of a treasure he might have, it would not be able to contend against that Demon Armament.”

“To use that sort of Demon Armament is simply equivalent to playing with fire. Since he has lost control of the Demon Armament, it means that only death awaits Chu Feng.”

After saying those words, Chu Huai sighed. He was feeling pity for Chu Feng’s death.

“Then what should we do now?” Chu Yue asked.

“We must immediately return to the clan. We must report all of this before Chu Bore returns to the clan,” Chu Huai said.

“Okay,” Chu Yue nodded.

Chu Huai and Chu Yue left. The people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm were still immersed in a state of being overjoyed.

After all... they had managed to survive a great catastrophe.

That said, Ying Mingchao, Wang Qiang and the others were not among those cheerful people.

They all knew that Chu Feng might’ve met with an accident, and that the person holding the Evil God Sword might not be Chu Feng.

“Damn it! D-Damn it!”

Wang Qiang kneeled on the ground and started to roar hysterically. He was pounding the ground with his fists, creating many large craters and countless cracks on the surface of the ground.

He was feeling extremely unreconciled.

It also seemed that he was regretting the fact that he was unable to catch that Evil God Sword.

“Husband, don’t act like this. What you’re doing right now is meaningless. This is not what Chu Feng would want to see,” Zhao Hong landed beside Wang Qiang and started to urge him to stop.

“T-Then what do y-you want me to do? W-Where did my b-brother go? W-Who e-exactly is that g-guy? Where d-did he t-take my b-brother?” Wang Qiang was extremely emotional and irritable.

“The way I see it, little friend Chu Feng should’ve been devoured by his Demon Armament. That body is still his. Merely, it is now controlled by the Demon Armament. Or perhaps... he is now being controlled by the Demon Armament.”

“That said, it might not necessarily be true that little friend Chu Feng has suffered some sort of mishap. After all... it is not the first time that little friend Chu Feng has used that Demon Armament. He should be able to handle it,” Zi Xunyi said.

“That’s right. What Xunyi says is very reasonable. Don’t worry too much. Perhaps Brother Chu Feng did not encounter any mishap,” Ying Mingchao said.

Even though both Zi Xunyi and Ying Mingchao were saying things like that, they were feeling very unwell in their hearts.

They had all witnessed the power of that Demon Armament. If it wanted to devour Chu Feng, who could possibly stop it?

............

The Evil God Sword was flying in the sky. Its speed was extremely fast. Simply no one from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm was able to catch sight of it.

“Where are you going?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am waiting for someone,” the Evil God Sword said.

“Waiting for someone? Who are you waiting for?” Chu Feng asked.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. Boy, you do not possess the qualifications to know these things.”

“After all, this Evil God has already done all that should be done. Your friends are also safe and sound now. Thus, it is now your turn to help this Evil God do some things,” the Evil God Sword said.
