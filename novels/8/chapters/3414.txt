Chapter 3414 - The Youngest Saint-cloak

Seeing Chu Feng and his overwhelming killing intent, even the three grand characters outside felt surprised. As for Linghu Hongfei who was inside the grand formation, he naturally felt even more astonished.

Even though Linghu Hongfei appeared to remain composed, there was clearly hesitation in his eyes.

The reason for his hesitation was not because he started to pay more attention to Chu Feng after feeling the killing intent that he emitted. Instead, it was because of what Chu Feng had said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

That Utmost Exalted-level monster did not appear to be a fake at all. Yet, it was eliminated by Chu Feng with a single punch.

Then, recalling how Chu Feng was able to move about completely unhindered throughout the grand formation, Linghu Hongfei started feeling fear.

In terms of actual cultivation, not even ten thousand Chu Fengs would be a match for him.

However, facing a Chu Feng who possessed special power within the grand formation, Linghu Hongfei had lost his confidence.

“Chu Feng, those black flames are extraordinary. Even if you assimilate with them and obtain their power, you will have to pay a price.”

“For you to assimilate with that much of the black flames at once, I’m afraid that you will not be able to handle them,” Linghu Hongfei said to Chu Feng.

“Brother Hongfei, I am also afraid. My appetite is truly small. I am truly afraid that I will not be able to contain all these black flames.”

“However, there’s nothing I can do about it. These black flames seem to be determined to follow me, and insist on entering my body to assimilate with me. I am truly feeling very helpless about this matter. There is really nothing I can do.”

Chu Feng had a worried expression. It was as if he was truly worried about the matter.

Seeing such shameless behavior from Chu Feng, Linghu Hongfei felt so furious that his heart, liver, spleen and lungs were about to explode.

In terms of shamelessness, Chu Feng was evidently far more shameless than him.

Had it been a normal situation, Linghu Hongfei would definitely single-handedly grab Chu Feng and crush him to death. However, after losing his confidence in handling Chu Feng, he did not reveal the anger in his heart. Instead, he coldly said, “Chu Feng, don’t you be pleased with yourself just yet. The road is long, we shall wait and see.”

After he finished saying those words, Linghu Hongfei sat cross-legged on the ground and closed his eyes. He seemed to not plan to bother with Chu Feng anymore.

Chu Feng remained smiling even when faced with Linghu Hongfei’s threats. After all, he had encountered countless such threats on his journey so far.

In order to reach where he now stood, he had to step on those so-called geniuses, those so-called monster powers, and slowly walk over.

Then, Chu Feng also sat down cross-legged and began to assimilate with the black flames that had entered his body. After Chu Feng completely assimilated with the black flames in his body, a complete change occurred within him.

The boundless black gaseous flames had turned into boundless spirit power. However, the spirit power did not belong to Chu Feng. Furthermore, it was extremely frantic, and seemed to contain some other sort of power within it. This made it so that the spirit power was extremely difficult to control. Like a raging sea, it surged within Chu Feng’s body.

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng was unable to concern himself with too much. He had no choice but to focus on controlling the spirit power.

Otherwise, not to mention making a breakthrough in cultivation, he might even suffer a backlash.

“Master.”

Seeing that Chu Feng had begun to assimilate the black flames, Liangqiu Chengfeng looked to Grandmaster Liangqiu, “Chu Feng’s side should be fine now. We should...”

Grandmaster Liangqiu naturally knew what Liangqiu Chengfeng wanted to say. After Chu Feng assimilated with the black flames, it would be the crucial moment for the grand formation that they’d set up. Whether or not they would be able to make a breakthrough in their spirit power would all depend on that one point.

Earlier, he hadn’t entered their spirit formation because his mood was ruined after Chu Feng’s black flames were seized by Linghu Hongfei. However, the situation now was completely different.

Linghu Hongfei had fallen for Chu Feng’s trap. Not only had Chu Feng retrieved all his stolen black flames and more, but even Linghu Hongfei, who was originally planning to attack Chu Feng, ultimately reached a compromise due to fear.

Chu Feng had gained complete control over the situation. With this, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s mood had gotten extremely good. As such, it was time for him to enter the spirit formation and retrieve his long-awaited results.

Merely, Grandmaster Liangqiu still had a trace of hesitation. Thus, he looked to Linghu Yuhua. who stood beside him.

“Go ahead. You’ve meticulously prepared it for so long. Don’t waste it like this.”

“You don’t have to worry about this place either. Ignoring the fact that I’m unable to enter that grand formation, even if I’m able to enter it, I would not go and ruin the current state of affairs. I’ve said it already: I will not involve myself in matters between the younger generations. As long as no one causes harm to Hongfei, I will not interfere at all,” Linghu Yuhua not only knew about Grandmaster Liangqiu’s grand formation, but she also knew what he was worried about.

“If I’m able to successfully make a breakthrough, I will invite you to drink,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“Are you not going to invite me to a drinking session if you fail to make a breakthrough?” Linghu Yuhua asked.

“I’ll still invite you,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“In that case, I want to drink the exquisite wine that you’ve collected for over three thousand years,” Linghu Yuhua said.

“Deal,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“Very well. Go on ahead, don’t miss this opportunity,” with a smile on her face, Linghu Yuhua waved her hand.

“Many thanks,” Grandmaster Liangqiu clasped his fist toward Linghu Yuhua. He was thanking her for not attacking Chu Feng.

Otherwise, with Linghu Yuhua’s strength, there was likely no one present that could possibly stop her.

After his words left his mouth, Grandmaster Liangqiu leaped forth and left. Liangqiu Chengfeng also clasped his fist toward Linghu Yuhua and left following Grandmaster Liangqiu.

At this moment, only Linghu Yuhua remained.

“It would appear that the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist will really appear.”

“Merely, it seems to be different from what our clan had expected.”

“Our meticulous scheming ultimately helped someone else. I wonder if the people within the clan will be willing to leave the matter at that.”

Linghu Yuhua looked to Chu Feng inside the spirit formation and sighed.

There was a trace of worry in her words. She seemed to... not want the Linghu Heavenly Clan to become Chu Feng’s enemy.

Chu Feng was naturally unable to hear the words spoken outside the grand formation.

Even if he were capable of hearing them, he would not bother to. After all, he was currently confronted with a crisis.

After the black flames had assimilated with Chu Feng, the spirit power that they transformed into still did not belong to Chu Feng. Furthermore, it was going berserk.

Fortunately, Chu Feng’s psyche was especially strong. Thus, he soon managed to assimilate with a portion of the spirit formation’s power.

Soon, Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques managed to reach a breakthrough.

Although the spirit power that he was capable of summoning was still only Exalted-cloak, it had progressed to the Dragon Mark level.

Chu Feng had successfully broken through to Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

“Beloved master, please enter a contract with me. I wish to serve you.”

At the instant when Chu Feng managed to make a breakthrough, that familiar voice was heard once again.

It was that world spirit again. Whenever Chu Feng made a breakthrough recently, he would hear that world spirit’s voice.

Chu Feng was filled with curiosity toward that world spirit. He was curious as to how she had found him, and why she was so determined to make a contract with him.

However, the spirit power transformed by the black flames inside Chu Feng’s body was simply too powerful. Furthermore, it was growing more and more berserk.

It was not surging like waves in Chu Feng’s body. Instead, it was surging like boiling magma. If Chu Feng didn’t control the surging spirit power properly, it would burst from his body like a volcanic eruption. At that time, he would not be able to retrieve the spirit power, and would miss out on the opportunity to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

As such, Chu Feng had to seize this opportunity!!!

“Beloved master, please believe in my loyalty to you and enter a contract with me so that I can become your devoted servant,” seeing that Chu Feng did not respond, that world spirit’s voice sounded again.

“Girl, don’t disturb me. I have no time to chat with you right now. We can talk next time,” Chu Feng said impatiently. Then, he forcibly severed his connection to that world spirit.

“Damn it! You dare refuse me?! Just you wait!!!”

At the moment when Chu Feng forcibly severed the connection, he was met with a threat-filled shout from that world spirit.

“Sure enough, she doesn’t possess good intentions. The courteousness from before was merely a disguise,” Chu Feng said with his lips curled.

Chu Feng’s reaction was understandable. After all, that world spirit had simply become hostile too quickly.

That said, Chu Feng had no heart to bother with her. After all, the most important thing for him at that moment was to quickly assimilate with all of the boundless spirit power within his body so that he could make a breakthrough to Saint-cloak World Spiritist in a single stroke.

If Chu Feng’s talent for martial cultivation was inherited from his father, then his talent for world spirit techniques must have been inherited from his mother.

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to perfectly display his talent.

The boundless spirit power resembled an area of densely packed, chaotic lightning.

As for the power of Chu Feng’s psyche, it was like a lightning pole.

Trying to rely on a single lightning pole to gather the berserk lightning into an orderly location was an extremely difficult task.

However, Chu Feng was capable of such a feat.

In the beginning, the spirit power was extremely berserk. However, under the control of Chu Feng’s psyche, the spirit power started to gradually and orderly assimilate with him.

At the moment when the spirit power had completely assimilated with Chu Feng, the spirit power that Chu Feng possessed suddenly underwent a complete transformation.

Chu Feng’s Dragon Mark spirit power had once again returned to Insect Mark.

Merely, it was no longer Exalted-level. Instead, it had become Saint-level!!!

“Success!” Linghu Yuhua let out a cry of alarm outside the grand formation.

Inside the grand formation, Linghu Hongfei was filled with jealousy.

Chu Feng was emitting a boundless amount of spirit power from his body. Furthermore, that spirit power possessed the same aura as Chu Feng himself. That spirit power now belonged to Chu Feng.

The magnificent sight allowed everyone that saw Chu Feng to know that the current Chu Feng was... a Saint-cloak World Spiritist!!!
