Chapter 5798: Huangfu Zhantian

Chu Feng hurriedly took a second look to check if he wasn’t seeing things, but the formation abruptly stalled to a halt. He opened his eyes and saw both the talisman’s formation and the copper pot’s runes disintegrating.

The copper pot was still emanating the aura of the Immemorial Era, but it had no utility value aside from being an antique. It would appear that the copper pot was a one-time-use item.

It was no wonder why Master Nine Zenith was unsure whether this method would work or not, for he had never tried it before.

“Benefactor Chu Feng, did the method fail?” Master Nine Zenith thought that Chu Feng had failed because of his awful expression.

“It worked, but Master Nine Zenith, can the copper pot only be used once?” Chu Feng was reluctant to give up just like that.

“Yes, it can only be used once,” Master Nine Zenith replied.

“Is there any other way I could enter a similar state as I was in earlier?” Chu Feng asked.

“The formation I constructed helps to guide your consciousness through the Bloodline Bond, but the key to making this work is still the copper pot,” Master Nine Zenith replied.

“I understand. Thank you for your help, Master Nine Zenith,” Chu Feng replied. “While I sensed another Ruler’s Bloodline, I can’t tell for certain whether it belongs to my mother or not. Perhaps due to the limitations of the formation, I didn’t feel a sense of intimacy with the Ruler’s Bloodline, and I couldn’t sense my mother’s aura either. However, the Ruler’s Bloodline I sensed is healthy and intact.”

“It looks like I’m unable to allay Benefactor Chu Feng’s worries,” Master Nine Zenith replied with a sigh.

“Master Nine Zenith, my mother’s safety is at stake here. I doubt I’d be able to put my heart at ease till I see her safe and sound,” Chu Feng said.

He felt apologetic as it seemed as if he was being stubborn even though Master Nine Zenith had already done a huge favor for him despite them being strangers.

“I understand your feelings, Benefactor Chu Feng, and I wish to relieve you of your worries. But as my disciple should have told you, the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation doesn’t belong to me. I’m unable to use its formation to pry into the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, or else I’d be able to offer you a certain answer,” Master Nine Zenith said.

“Master Nine Zenith, you have already helped me greatly. I would have died in Jie Tianran’s hands if you hadn’t shaken me out of my trance with this formation,” Chu Feng replied.

“Haa. I don’t understand why Jie Tianran harbors such great hostility toward you. He shouldn’t have been such an unreasonable person,” Master Nine Zenith replied with a sigh.

“Elder, are you acquainted with him?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am acquainted with him, but we aren’t close. Rather, I was closer to your mother. Your mother helped me back then, and I’m glad to be able to return the favor today,” Master Nine Zenith said. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Chu Feng thought that Master Nine Zenith had helped him out of kindness, but who could have thought that it was due to his mother?

“Benefactor Chu Feng, is there anyone else you’d like to meet in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith?” Master Nine Zenith asked.

“Master Nine Zenith, is the Nine Heavens’ Zenith coming to an end?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes. Those who failed to get into the ranking board have been expelled from the grounds. There aren’t any rewards for those who got into the ranking board either, but I held them back as I thought you’d want to bid your friends farewell,” Master Nine Zenith said.

“Yes, I’d like to meet my friends. I’m counting on you, Master Nine Zenith,” Chu Feng said.

“Don’t worry, it isn’t much of a hassle. Who would you like to meet? I can bring them here,” Master Nine Zenith said.

Before Chu Feng could say a thing, Master Nine Zenith suddenly raised his head to look at the sky. He tightened his grip on his prayer beads as his eyes turned sharp.

“What’s wrong, Master Nine Zenith?” Chu Feng could tell that something had happened.

With a tap of his finger, Master Nine Zenith imbued a formation into Chu Feng. That allowed Chu Feng to see through the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s barrier to see the scenery outside.

The Pulse Ignition Realm had been sealed off once more, but this time around, it was sealed off by thick lightning chains that intersected into a lightning web.

While Chu Feng’s vision was limited, he figured that the entire realm had been sealed off by the lightning chains.

“Is it the Huangfu Heavenly Clan?” Chu Feng wondered.

Meanwhile, the crowd outside was unnerved.

The lightning chains were formidable, but they weren't the means of any of the existing powerhouses. The crowd outside was still oblivious to the existence of the Huangfu Heavenly Clan, so this unfamiliar means stoked their fear and unease.

Only Song Changsheng knew where the lightning chains were from.

Another person had appeared in the space beyond the Pulse Ignition Realm’s atmosphere. It was a middle-aged man with white hair. He was dressed like Huangfu Shengyu and the others, and he carried a black, wooden box behind him too.

He was the one who had tossed out the lightning chains to seal off the realm.

“Weak ants, I shall enlighten you to the true prowess of a cultivator today! Tremble, for today you will breathe your last,” the middle-aged man murmured even though he was channeling the lightning chains alone in outer space.

Unable to bear it anymore, Song Changsheng flitted up to the middle-aged man.

“AHHH!” The middle-aged man was startled by Song Changsheng. “Who are you?”

“It doesn’t matter who I am. I know you don’t belong to this era, so I’ll offer you some words of advice—don’t break the harmony here,” Song Changsheng said.

“You’re right. It doesn’t matter who you are, since you are all present-era cultivators. However, who I am is extremely important,” the middle-aged man said.

“I don’t care who you are. Leave this place,” Song Changsheng said.

“You’ll care. You must be quite strong to have appeared here. You must be a highly esteemed figure among present-day cultivators. What a pity. You’ll die in my hands today, for I, Huangfu Zhantian, am the second greatest prodigy in the Huangfu Heavenly Clan since its founding. Consider it your honor to die in my hands!”

The middle-aged man unleashed his oppressive might. He had narrowed his oppressive might to a small area, limiting it to only Song Changsheng. It exerted an incredible force that surpassed what True God level cultivators were capable of.

Even a pinnacle True God level cultivator would be reduced to ashes upon contact with it.

Yet, this immense force looked no different than a breeze when exerted on Song Changsheng. It tugged on his hair and robe, but he remained completely unharmed. It didn’t even damage the sleeves of his robe.

“You’re actually that powerful?”

The confident Huangfu Zhantian was dumbfounded.
