Chapter 2413 - Taboo Technique

“Senior, exactly what happened?” Chu Feng asked. He had realized that this Ying Mingchao seemed to really possess enormous hatred against the Kong Heavenly Clan.

“Didn’t you ask me why I would be here? This is all forced by the Kong Heavenly Clan,” Ying Mingchao said.

Then, Ying Mingchao began to narrate what had happened to Chu Feng in full detail.

Over a thousand years ago, Ying Mingchao and his Hero City were most flourishing.

The Hero City of that time not only possessed their own territory and range of influence, they also possessed some remnants.

Ying Mingchao had just left a remnant with a group of experts. Although he was exhausted at that time, he was very delighted at being able to successfully obtain benefits from that remnant.

Prompted by a sudden impulse, Ying Mingchao decided to bring his brothers with him to enjoy some wine.

It just so happened that he encountered the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chiefs.

The two clan chiefs insisted on inviting Ying Mingchao to be a guest at the Kong Heavenly Clan. They even told him that the Kong Heavenly Clan possessed great wine that had been kept in storage for ten thousand years.

As Ying Mingchao and his brothers were all people who were fond of drinking, they were naturally prompted by the promise of good wine. Furthermore, as the two clan chiefs were very eager, they found it hard to refuse them. Thus, they arrived at the Kong Heavenly Clan.

However, never did they expect that invitation to be a trap.

It turned out that the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan were afraid that Ying Mingchao would continue to mature and one day become the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s overlord. Thus, they wanted to kill Ying Mingchao before he could mature.

When Ying Mingchao found out what they wanted to do, it was already too late. All of his brothers that had accompanied him to the Kong Heavenly Clan were killed. He himself was also unable to defeat the joint forces of the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan’s clan chiefs.

With no other option, Ying Mingchao had no choice but to attempt to escape. However, the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan had already been prepared, and blocked off all his routes of escape. In the end, Ying Mingchao had escaped into the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.

Unfortunately, he had triggered a slaughtering formation, and was sucked into it. The slaughtering formation was so powerful that it was capable of killing him.

With no other option, Ying Mingchao used a taboo technique. This taboo technique that he used was able to prevent him from being killed by the slaughtering formation.

That taboo technique of his was very powerful. After using it, Ying Mingchao’s body disappeared. Although it didn’t truly disappear, it would make it so that the great majority of the spirit formations became unable to detect him, and no eyes could see him.

However, since it was a taboo technique, it would naturally also possess a very serious side effect. That side effect was that, he would no longer be able to move. Unless he was to undo the taboo technique, he would not be able to move a single step.

Luckily, Ying Mingchao was not in the slaughtering formation the entire time. The reason for that was because within the depths of the slaughtering formation was a teleportation formation. Thus, when Ying Mingchao came in contact with the teleportation formation, he was sent to this place.

Merely, after Ying Mingchao arrived, the side effect completely burst forth. As such, Ying Mingchao ended up being trapped there.

“It seems like one can reach this place should one be able to survive the slaughtering formations. This place’s trial is truly interesting,” After finding out about Ying Mingchao’s experience, Chu Feng understood the design Kong Yingyi had toward this place.

Although those slaughtering formations were very dangerous, they actually served as a shortcut to the palace. As long as one could survive through a slaughtering formation, they would be able to arrive at that place. However, evidently, over all these years, Ying Mingchao was the only one that managed to survive.

However, it was very unfortunate for Ying Mingchao. Due to the fact that he had used the taboo technique, even though he had managed to reach the location where his enemy’s treasures were contained, he was unable to bring any away with him.

“Logically, after senior used your taboo technique, you should not only be unable to move, but also become unable to speak or use your oppressive might, no?” Chu Feng said.

“That’s right. I have been trapped in here for over a thousand years. Although the side effect of my taboo technique has gradually weakened, I am still unable to leave this place.”

“Boy, think about it. A person being trapped in one place for over a thousand years. There is no one to speak to him, and even if he is tired, he cannot change his position. Furthermore, there is nothing to eat and drink. Merely by thinking about it, one can imagine how painful it is.”

“Oh, that’s right. Do you have anything to eat? Wine, that’s right, wine, boy, do you have any wine with you?” Ying Mingchao suddenly asked.

“I do,” Chu Feng took out some food and a jug of good wine from his Cosmos Sack.

“Boy, you actually really carry wine around with you? Quickly, quickly, quickly give it to me, give it to me,” After seeing the drinks and wine in Chu Feng’s hands, Ying Mingchao became incomparably excited.

Even though Chu Feng was unable to see Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng was able to faintly feel Ying Mingchao’s gaze. At that moment, Ying Mingchao was most definitely staring at Chu Feng’s food and wine like a starved tiger on the verge of death encountering a little sheep.

Chu Feng walked over to where Ying Mingchao was. He was not afraid. The reason for that was because if Ying Mingchao wanted to do something to him, there would be no way for Chu Feng to survive.

After Chu Feng arrived before Ying Mingchao, he asked, “Senior, since you’re unable to move, how are you to eat? You couldn’t possibly be planning to have this junior feed you, right?”

“Get out of here! If you were a woman, it would be fine for you to feed me. Yet, you, a grown man, want to feed me? This great sir does not have that sort of indulgence.”

“Although this great sir is unable to move, I possess cultivation. Merely by controlling my oppressive might, I am able to provide for myself,” At the same time Ying Mingchao said those words, a burst of oppressive might arrived before Chu Feng. That oppressive might took away the food and wine Chu Feng held in his hand.

“Since you’re able to use your oppressive might to handle the food, why do you still want me to bring them over?” Chu Feng asked in a slightly dissatisfied manner.

“After all is said and done, this great sir still does not possess liberty. While using my oppressive might to kill others is something doable, to operate it for a task like handling food is still quite troublesome. If you’re too far away, I fear that I might make a mistake and scatter my wine.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Woah! It’s been over a thousand years! It’s been over a thousand years since I last smelled the fragrance of wine! This is truly the most aromatic smell in the entire world!” After Ying Mingchao finished saying those words, gulping sounds could be heard nonstop. Likely, Ying Mingchao had begun his wine drinking.

“Boy, is there any more wine? Come, accompany this great sir in drinking,” Ying Mingchao asked.

“I do, I have a lot,” Chu Feng took out over a hundred jugs of wine.

“Woah! Boy, you actually carry this much wine with you?!” Upon seeing those jugs of wine, Ying Mingchao grew even more excited and emotional.

“When outside, one must always prepare a lot of good wine just in case the situation calls for it.” Chu Feng said with a smile. As he spoke, he sat cross-legged on the ground and opened a jug of wine. He said, “Senior, this junior offers you a toast.”

“Very well. You’re frank and straightforward. Boy, I admire you. Come, drink,” Ying Mingchao said excitedly.

Even though Chu Feng was unable to see Ying Mingchao, he was able to see Ying Mingchao controlling the jug of wine with his oppressive might so as to toast with him.

“Drink,” Chu Feng smiled. Then, he gulped the jug of wine in his hand down in one go.

“Ahh, rejuvenating,” Ying Mingchao gulped down his jug of wine. However, he was not yet content. Using his oppressive might, he directly opened two jugs of wine.

As for the food that Chu Feng gave him, he did not bother to take a single bite. Sure enough, this Ying Mingchao was a drunkard. His love for wine surpassed everything else.

“Senior, it’s time that we move on to proper business. For you to want me to stay, it should be because you hope that I will be able to help you, right? What must I do to help you? You can go ahead and tell me,” Chu Feng said to Ying Mingchao.

Chu Feng was unable to see Ying Mingchao. Thus, he knew that Ying Mingchao’s taboo technique must be extremely powerful.

Not to mention that Chu Feng would not be able to bring him away, it would likely be very difficult for Chu Feng to help Ying Mingchao even though he was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

Since Chu Feng had no idea how he was to help Ying Mingchao, he had no choice but to ask Ying Mingchao about it. He hoped that Ying Mingchao, the person who used the taboo technique, knew how to undo the taboo technique.

“We’re enjoying ourselves right now, there’s no need to rush. Come boy, accompany this great sir in drinking some more,” A jug of opened wine flew toward Chu Feng.

It turned out that Ying Mingchao had opened two jugs of wine because he had prepared one of them for Chu Feng.
