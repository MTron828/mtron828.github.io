Chapter 3679 - Three Gazes

“Clan Chief Chu, we’ve already given you a chance. Unfortunately, you did not cherish it.”

“Thus, do not blame us for being ruthless.”

An expert from the Blood-devouring Hall mocked. The other seven were all laughing in a ridiculing manner.

Suddenly, the leader of the eight shouted, “Today, our Blood-devouring Hall is going to exterminate the Chu Heavenly Clan. Who dares to accompany us?”

He was doing that on purpose. He knew that there were over ten thousand experts gathered outside the Chu Heavenly Clan that wanted to suppress them.

Knowing that, he decided to make that declaration purposefully, so that those people would join them in the massacre of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Me!!!”

“I’ll join!”

Sure enough, once the question was raised, many people immediately answered it.

Upon close inspection, there were over five thousand people!!!

Without a doubt, those people were all those that were there to crusade against the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had decided to spare them earlier, they evidently did not possess any gratitude.

At that moment, those people were once again emitting killing intent. One by one, they soared into the sky and stood behind the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall.

Like a bunch of restless wolves, they would immediately bare their fangs and frantically massacre the Chu Heavenly Clansmen once the order was given.

“Those guys!”

Seeing that, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others were so furious that their eyes turned deep red.

They knew that those people who were there to mount a crusade against them would not be willing to give up so easily. Merely, they had not expected for them to decide to attack their Chu Heavenly Clan again so quickly.

Compared to Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others, the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall were very satisfied with the current situation.

This was precisely what they wanted.

“Very well. Those who seek vengeance shall obtain it.”

“Listen carefully. After we breach the final barrier of the Chu Heavenly Clan, you all are to rush inside and, regardless of men, women, young or old, slaughter everyone in your path. Don’t leave a single person alive. Today shall be the day the Chu Heavenly Clan is exterminated.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Understand?” an expert from the Blood-devouring Hall asked loudly.

“Exterminate the Chu Heavenly Clan!!!”

“Kill!!!”

At that moment, the crusading army became particularly excited. They once again exposed their deep hatred for the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Clan Chief Chu, are you prepared for death?”

The eight experts from the Blood-devouring Sect simultaneously turned their gazes to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

The ‘final barrier’ that they spoke of was actually the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Once the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was defeated, there would be no need to concern themselves with the others in the Chu Heavenly Clan. They would truly become powerless lambs waiting to be slaughtered. Even if they were unwilling to die, they would still die upon the butcher’s knives.

“You will have to pass through this old man first if you want to slaughter my Chu Heavenly Clan!”

Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief let out a loud roar. Then, black gaseous flames poured forth from his body.

Black vein lines also appeared on his skin. Like veins, the black vein lines rapidly spread through his body, covering him. His eyes also changed enormously. Like a raging demonic beast, they turned blood-red.

The previously amiable-looking Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had turned into a terrifying existence. He appeared even more terrifying than the eight from the Blood-devouring Hall.

Most importantly, after the black gaseous flames appeared, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s battle power increased again.

Seeing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looking like that, the experts from the crusading army standing behind the eight Blood-devouring Hall’s experts were all scared.

The current Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief simply looked too terrifying.

Thus, they were starting to regret their decision to challenge the Chu Heavenly Clan again.

They knew very well that if the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall failed to defeat the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, they would no longer be allowed to leave safely like they had earlier.

“Lord Clan Chief, you...”

Compared to the others, when Chu Xuanzhengfa and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen saw the appearance of their Lord Clan Chief, worry filled their eyes. They felt so pained that they nearly broke out in tears.

They knew that their Lord Clan Chief possessed a very terrifying forbidden medicine.

Upon taking that forbidden medicine, one’s battle power would greatly increase. However, the backlash from taking it was extremely vicious, so much so that it might end up killing the user!!!

Seeing the current change in appearance of their Lord Clan Chief, they knew that their Lord Clan Chief had taken that powerful forbidden medicine.

But, even if their Lord Clan Chief was able to win the battle, the backlash from taking the forbidden medicine might end up killing him.

That was the reason they felt so aggrieved. After all, if it wasn’t to protect them, their Lord Clan Chief simply would not have to do such a thing.

“Die!”

An explosive voice was heard as boundless killing intent surged forth.

It was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He had unleashed his attack.

Different from before, his attack was filled with killing intent this time around. He was no longer holding anything back.

He was not only planning to kill the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall, but he was also planning to erase the ten thousand-plus people that stood behind those eight.

At that moment, many of the people that stood behind the eight from the Blood-devouring Hall had turned deathly pale with fear. The more cowardly among them even decided to turn around and flee.

“Humph. You think you can win against us by taking some forbidden medicine? You are truly foolish.”

Compared to the others, even though the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had greatly increased his battle power, the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall were still not showing any signs of fear.

“Rumble, rumble~~~”

Rumbles began to sound as martial power began to wreak havoc all over.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was once again locked in battle against the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall.

Most shockingly, even though the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had clearly taken a forbidden medicine, he was still unable to defeat the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall.

With the situation being like that, even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief began to panic.

He had given his all in the fight, and had unleashed all the abilities he possessed. Yet, he was only able to fight the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall to a stalemate.

Although the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall were unable to defeat him either, he had only gained his current battle power through using that forbidden medicine.

Once the effect of the forbidden medicine wore off, not only would he die, but all the Chu Heavenly Clansmen would die too.

......

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not know that there were three pairs of eyes watching what was happening in the Chu Heavenly Clan from the distant sky.

Even the battle between him and the eight Blood-devouring Hall’s experts was clearly being witnessed by the three pairs of eyes.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief also did not know that the owners of those three gazes belonged to...

...the City Masters of Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Monstrous Holy City and Divine Body Royal City.
