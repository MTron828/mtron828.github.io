Chapter 5875: Where Dreams Began

Chu Feng, Little Fishy, and the others had previously entered the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation, where he, Wang Qiang, Little Fishy, and Xianhai Shaoyu had successfully constructed their Dao Creation Buildings.

The latter three made a breakthrough in their cultivation as a result, but Chu Feng didn’t receive any benefits. His Dao Creation Palace merely pointed him to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

Now that he was back in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, he turned to look at the Dao Creation Palace inside him, but to his surprise, the guidance didn’t become clearer. It was still pointing at the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

This was different from what he had expected.

Even so, he had no plans of giving up. He had to overcome the hurdle known as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and the Dao Creation Palace was a means for him to do so. Besides, he had ideas of his own too.

He figured that there were two likely places.

One was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land. His father had told him that the forbidden land contained energy that could evolve his Heavenly Bloodline, but his cultivation back then was too weak to tap into it.

He had to become sufficiently strong before he could tap into the power to awaken his bloodline.

He now knew that there were two different bloodlines in his body. One was the powerful nine-colored lightning in his dantian, but that was an external power that slipped into his body when he was ten years of age. It was thanks to it that his talent greatly improved.

It was a huge reason why he was able to come this far.

However, Chu Feng had another bloodline in him, and that was the bloodline his father had passed down to him. For some reason, he had never been able to sense this bloodline, though he now knew that it was extremely powerful.

His bloodline going berserk was a result of his inherited bloodline.

He wasn’t sure which of his bloodlines would be awakened if he visited the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land, but regardless, it should make him much stronger than before.

Alternatively, the guidance could also be pointing toward the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, due to the Asura Palace inside his World Spirit Space. The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect had been the most powerful world spiritist organization in the early years of the current era, inheriting most of the Ancient Era’s world spiritist treasures.

Chu Feng was not just a cultivator but a world spiritist. If he could inherit the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s legacy, his prowess as a world spiritist would surely grow by leaps and bounds. However, it looked like it wouldn’t be easy for him to enter the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect, so he decided to head to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land to take a look first.

“Big brother Chu Feng, are you going to leave the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect? I told my master that I’ll follow you wherever you go,” Zi Ling said.

Chu Feng turned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

“I told Zi Ling I’d let her find you once she comes out of her closed-door cultivation. Her cultivation didn’t reach the level I expected because she forcefully came out of it, but I’ll still fulfill my promise to her,” the sectmaster replied.

“Big brother Chu Feng, are you going to scorn me for being a burden to you?” Zi Ling asked with a smile.

“What are you saying? My Zi Ling is my greatest backing! However, I’m not planning to leave the Ancestral Martial Galaxy yet, and there are some places I’d like to explore on my own. Let’s travel together when I’m about to leave the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, all right?” Chu Feng said.

He didn’t think that Zi Ling was a burden to him, but he was still worried about her safety.

“That won’t do. I’ll go wherever you go from this day onward. I’ll accompany you even if you’re heading to a realm occupied by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. I might not be able to help you, but I’ll stand by your side and brave through danger with you,” Zi Ling spoke determinedly.

She usually followed Chu Feng’s bidding, but not this time. She felt like her heart was going to beat out of her chest when Chu Feng went out to challenge the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city alongside JIe Tianran. She was afraid that Jie Tianran would notice Chu Feng and kill him, and she would only be watching helplessly from a far distance away.

Even though she knew deep down she was powerless against such existence, she wanted to at least brave danger alongside Chu Feng.

“All right, we’ll travel together. However, I need to make a trip to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land first, and you can’t enter the premises yet, so you’ll have to wait for me to return,” Chu Feng said.

“That won’t do. I’ll go with you,” Zi Ling insisted.

Left with no choice, Chu Feng sent a voice transmission over. “Zi Ling, my father set up a protective formation around our Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land. The formation is extremely powerful, such that only I’ll be able to enter. You might face danger if I bring you along.”

“Big brother Chu Feng, did you forget that I have cultivated inside your Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land together with your father and Elder Ape? That person is not just your father but my master too. He’s an extremely meticulous person. I doubt he will hurt me even if he doesn’t allow me to enter the premises. Your excuse doesn’t hold,” Zi Ling said.

Chu Feng knew that there was no dissuading Zi Ling, so he turned to the sectmaster and said, “Lord Sectmaster, I’ll be bringing Zi Ling with me then.”

Chu Feng’s compromise evoked a peal of laughter from the sectmaster. “You always act as if you don’t fear anything, but it turns out that you’re afraid of your wife.”

“Of course. There’s nothing bigger than my wife in this world.” Chu Feng agreed.

“I know you mean it, Chu Feng. Zi Ling has a good eye for people.” As she spoke, the sectmaster passed a teleportation token each to Chu Feng and Zi Ling. “Our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s teleportation formation can take you wherever you want in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but the teleportation may take longer when I’m not channeling it.”

“Thank you, sectmaster. We’ll be making a move then.” Chu Feng and Zi Ling took the teleportation tokens and activated the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s teleportation formation.

While the teleportation speed was not as fast as when the sectmaster channeled it, it was, by no means, slow either. It was much faster than ancient teleportation formations.

“A teleportation formation that can teleport one anywhere—I wonder whether our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s founder or the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s founder is stronger,” Zi Ling remarked. “Big brother Chu Feng, what do you think?”

Chu Feng turned over and saw Zi Ling looking at him with clear eyes and a beaming smile.

She only revealed such a side in front of Chu Feng.

“Our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s founder is more formidable,” Chu Feng replied.

“How do you know, big brother Chu Feng?” Zi Ling’s curiosity was further piqued by Chu Feng’s affirmative reply.

“Instincts. It could also be because we’re Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s disciples, so I’m more inclined toward our founder,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

“Instincts? Actually, I feel the same too,” Zi Ling replied.

Shortly after, the two of them arrived at the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm’s Heavenly Road. Looking at this familiar yet foreign place filled Chu Feng with many emotions. Back then, they were still stuck in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, not knowing what the world outside held. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Holy Land of Martialism was a sacred land of all cultivators, but those who wished to enter from the Eastern Sea Region had to face a heavenly tribulation, so this path became known as Heavenly Road.

This was also the place where his dreams began.
