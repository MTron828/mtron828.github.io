Chapter 4011 - Terrifying Everyone

“Unleash a massacre?”

“You’re truly one to boast. Do you really think our five great powers are a bunch of vegetarians?”

“Arrogant little thief, today, you will pay for what you’ve done.”

“Zzzz~~~”

The Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster was the first person to attack.

In his hand, the Wind Lightning Sword unleashed a completely different sort of power.

The lightning was like dragons and the violent wind was like blades. Even though it was clearly only a single sword, a single wave of the sword had unleashed a great army of wind and lightning that rushed to attack Chu Feng.

After the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster attacked, the other four leaders also attacked.

They did not hold back, and used powerful attacks from the get go. They planned to quickly subdue Chu Feng.

Whilst the leaders of the five great powers were taking on Chu Feng with their full power... the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster moved to the side.

He did not join the fray. Rather, he was healing his injuries and observing the situation of the battle.

“Exactly what sort of power is that little bastard using?”

“It couldn’t possibly be a treasure from the stone case world, right?”

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster’s expression was one of being very annoyed.

He discovered that even though the five great powers’ leaders were taking on Chu Feng together, they were still unable to suppress him. Instead, they were being slightly suppressed by Chu Feng instead.

One must know that those five were the strongest experts of five starfields. Yet, they were actually unable to defeat Chu Feng even after joining hands.

If the power Chu Feng displayed at that moment was truly brought forth by a treasure from the stone case world, one could very well tell how precious that treasure was from the battle power he displayed.

Just imagining the fact that such a heaven-defying treasure should’ve belonged to him, the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster became even more displeased.

“I cannot let this go on.”

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster knew that if this were to continue, even the five great powers’ leaders would not be a match for Chu Feng. He knew that they would be completely ruined.

Whilst the five great powers’ leaders might only be defeated, it would be completely different for him.

He would definitely be killed.

After all, Chu Feng was working with Zhao Hong and Han Xiu. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Because of that, he turned his gaze to Zhao Hong and Han Xiu, who were also treating their injuries.

After seeing them, a sinister smile emerged on Liu Shuo’s face.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, his body shifted. He turned into a flash of light and flew towards Zhao Hong and Han Xiu.

He planned to capture them and use them to threaten Chu Feng.

Sensing his movements, Zhao Hong’s expression changed enormously.

At that moment she was unable to contend against him at all.

She and Han Xiu were like fish on the chopping block, powerless to resist the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster’s slaughter.

Most importantly, she knew what he intended to do.

If they were truly captured by him, Chu Feng would definitely be threatened by him.

“You...”

However, before the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster could reach Zhao Hong and Han Xiu, he suddenly stopped. Not only that, a look of fear was present on his face.

A figure had blocked his path. As for that person, it was none other than Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had actually managed to breach the siege of the five leaders and block his path.

Furthermore, his gaze was incomparably cold. Even the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster turned pale with fright upon seeing that gaze.

“Despicable bastard, don’t think I don’t know what you’re trying to do.”

As Chu Feng spoke, the golden sword he held in his hand turned into a flash of light and thrust straight toward Liu Shuo’s dantian.

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster tried to avoid the incoming sword. However, he was shocked to discover that Chu Feng’s sword was many times faster than him.

It was simply impossible for him to avoid the sword.

“Puu~~~”

Blood splattered. Chu Feng’s sword had pierced into Liu Shuo’s dantian.

Then, Chu Feng swept his sword sideways.

Golden light streaked through the air. In the following moment, screams sounded.

When the crowd noticed what had happened, they were no longer only astonished.

They were completely bewildered to discover that the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster had been sliced into two by Chu Feng.

His two halves then fell from the air and smashed ruthlessly into the ground.

Even though he was the sectmaster of the All-heaven Sect, no one had rushed over to catch him. His appearance was truly miserable.

Everyone knew that the people from the All-heaven Sect definitely wanted to rush over to catch him. Unfortunately, none of them dared to do so.

Even their strongest Lord Sectmaster was powerless to take on Chu Feng, they would simply be throwing their lives away if they were to rashly rush over.

Seeing the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster struggling in a pool of blood with his body sliced in two, the crowd’s expressions became even more complicated.

Although the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster was still alive, his cultivation had been damaged and he was seriously injured. The crowd were also able to imagine through his miserable heart-wrenching screams what sort of suffering he was undergoing at that moment.

But, one should know that he was the sectmaster of the All-heaven Sect, the strongest expert of the All-heaven Starfield.

Yet, someone like him had actually been defeated by a person of the younger generation.

When they thought of that and looked to Chu Feng again, fear filled their eyes.

“Are you all still planning to get in my way?”

“If you’re still planning to do so, you’ll also end up like him.”

Chu Feng turned his chilly gaze to the leaders of the five great powers.

Seeing Chu Feng’s gaze, they all felt their hearts tremble. Even though they were grand existences, looks of fear were still present in their eyes.

They’d all felt Chu Feng’s battle power through their earlier confrontation, and knew how strong he was.

Truth be told, they’d already realized that even if they decided to join hands, they would still find it very difficult to defeat the youngster called Asura.

In addition, the Chu Feng at that moment seemed to be even more powerful than the one they had fought earlier.

There was no longer the image of a second individual on Chu Feng.

The golden gases were burning on Chu Feng’s body like flames.

It was as if they’d already fused together.

They were able to imagine that Chu Feng must’ve unleashed that power to its pinnacle.

They were simply no match for him.

“Thank you for showing leniency, young friend.”

“Since young friend is such a loyal and righteous person, our Miao Heavenly Clan will not look further into what happened here today.”

Suddenly, the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief put his weapon away and clasped his fist respectfully at Chu Feng.

After saying those words, he actually soared into the sky and flew to where the Miao Heavenly Clansmen were.

“Clan Chief Miao, what is the meaning of this?”

Seeing that, both the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s sectmasters were confused.

However, the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not even bother to turn around. Just like that, he’d left.

“Young friend, our Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion will also not get in your way anymore.”

Then, the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master actually also clasped his fist respectfully at Chu Feng before flying in the direction of his people.

“You two...”

The expressions of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster turned even uglier.

“You still can’t tell what’s going on?”

“Young friend Asura’s strength is more than capable of killing us.”

“However, look carefully at your bodies. Is there a single bruise, a single wound?” The Inferno Academy’s headmaster said to the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster.

They’d naturally realized that they were uninjured, and that Chu Feng had been showing leniency towards them.

Yet, they were unwilling to reconcile. They were unwilling to let Chu Feng slip away just like that; they were unwilling to let him take away the mysterious treasure from the stone case world.

“No matter what, you are all leaders of your respective powers. How could you be this lacking in confidence that you’re scared to such a state by a person of the younger generation?”

“Utter disgrace.”

The Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster, those two arch-enemies, were actually joining hands to insult the other three leaders.

They were trying to urge them to act and join hands against Chu Feng again with their insults.

Unfortunately, not only did the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion’s pavilion master ignore them completely, but even the Inferno Academy’s headmaster who stood right next to them looked at them with contempt.

“Truly pigheaded.”

“Since that’s the case, the two of you can continue.”

“This old man is not going to accompany you.”

After saying those words, the Inferno Academy’s headmaster waved his sleeve, turned around and left.

With that, only the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster and the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster remained.

They looked towards Chu Feng, who stood in the sky not far away from them with a golden sword in hand and surging golden gas all over his body, and then to the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster, who was screaming on the ground. They did not dare to attack Chu Feng, yet they were unwilling to retreat.

They momentarily found themselves in an extremely awkward and embarrassing situation.
