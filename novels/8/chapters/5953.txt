Chapter 5954: Restriction of the Bloodline Ability

Xianhai Shuoyi’s rage subsided by the time he was tossed into the dungeon. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He realized that he committed a huge mistake, but he was still confused as to how Chu Feng was acquainted with Little Fishy, and why Little Fishy would look at him with such freezing eyes. He believed that he would still have a place in Little Fishy’s heart even if the two of them hadn’t been in contact in recent years.

At least, he should carry more weight compared to other clansmen.

Yet, he saw killing intent in Little Fishy’s eyes earlier. She intended to kill him despite all the time they had spent together.

“Shuoyi, are you out of your mind?” Xianhai Shuoyi’s mother suddenly barged into the prison with tearful eyes.

“Mother, I know I have done wrong, b-but that man... Who does he think he is to be by Yu’er’s side? I couldn’t hold it in...” Xianhai Shuoyi explained the reason behind his recklessness.

“Shuoyi, did you lose your wits from cultivating too much? Do you not know who Lord Chu Feng is?!” Xianhai Shuoyi’s mother stared at Xianhai Shuoyi in disbelief.

“Y-you’re calling him ‘Lord Chu Feng’?”

Xianhai Shuoyi realized that he might have underestimated Chu Feng’s standing. The latter must not have been trash as he had previously thought, or else his mother wouldn’t have called him ‘Lord Chu Feng’. “Does he... have a special identity?”

“Of course! Few in the world of cultivation would want to offend him, let alone us!”

Xianhai Shuoyi’s mother proceeded to share Chu Feng’s background and feats.

Xianhai Shuoyi was dumbfounded to learn that Chu Feng was Jie Ranqing’s son, and his face turned as pale as a sheet of paper. His legs caved in when he learned that Chu Feng confronted the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion but still escaped unscathed.

This shock only further deepened when he learned that Chu Feng was titled the strongest junior in the present world of cultivation, surpassing even Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Yu’er. His face crumbled in despair, as he collapsed to the ground like a sack of mud.

He finally understood why the elder was so fearful of Chu Feng that he imprisoned him on the spot because of his killing intent. He also understood why Xianhai Yu’er glared at him with such scary eyes.

What did he count as compared to Chu Feng?

His mother’s words felt like hammers striking his head, finally waking him up from his dream. Lying on the ground with widened eyes and trembling lips, he weakly murmured, “Mother, am I a goner?”

“Shuoyi, you’re lucky Lord Chu Feng is magnanimous to not pursue this matter, but you would still have to be punished for showing disrespect to an esteemed guest. You’ll be locked here for a hundred years,” Xianhai Shuoyi’s mother said.

“A hundred years?”

Xianhai Shuoyi would have gone on a rampage in the past after hearing those words, as he wouldn’t be a junior anymore after a hundred years. Yet he heaved a sigh of relief. He knew that being imprisoned for a hundred years after offending someone like Chu Feng’s stature was a light punishment.

His dream of catching up with Little Fishy wasn’t as important in the face of death.

“Mother, you said that Chu Feng rose through the ranks without any background from a place like the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” Xianhai Shuoyi asked.

“Indeed. At least there appears to be no one backing Lord Chu Feng from the current looks of it,” Xianhai Shuoyi’s mother replied.

Xianhai Shuoyi looked incredibly conflicted. There was a tinge of despair in his eyes, but at the same time, there was also a hint of relief. Even the craziest of people would regain their senses after going through a crisis.

Chu Feng’s appearance had helped Xianhai Shuoyi regain his rationality. Chu Feng overtook him despite the better cultivation resources he had; it was unlikely that he could ever surpass Chu Feng no matter how hard he worked now.

Even the most talented prodigies in the world of cultivation dimmed in comparison to Chu Feng, let alone Xianhai Shuoyi. He was probably nothing at all in Chu Feng’s eyes.

...

Before the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s internal teleportation formation, Little Fishy reluctantly looked at Chu Feng and said, “Big brother, I shan’t keep you here since you are busy, but you have to come here and look for me once you have time. My brother should be around the next time you come.”

“I will,” Chu Feng replied before stepping into the teleportation formation.

He first made his way toward another one of the Immortal Sea Galaxy’s realms, which had a teleportation formation leading to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Through the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, he made his way to a more populous realm in the Seven Realms Galaxy.

He could already make his breakthrough with the Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads he had obtained, but he decided to make his breakthrough in the Seven Realms Galaxy instead.

Heavenly lightning quickly enveloped the sky and descended to the ground. This caught the notice of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s experts residing in the realm. Only one person in the world of cultivation could induce such a huge heavenly lightning phenomenon.

Thus, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s experts immediately made their way to where the lightning fell. By the time they arrived, an ominous feeling surged into their hearts.

A series of words floated where the heavenly lightning fell—The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion must be trash. I, your Grandpa Chu Feng, can step onto your turf and leave as I please.

Chu Feng was obviously taunting them! But what they feared more was that Chu Feng would cause an incident in the realm they were stationed at.

“Find him right now! We have to root Chu Feng out no matter what it takes! Also, report this matter to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. The lords there will decide on our next move,” an elder of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion ordered.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s experts dispersed into the surroundings.

However, they knew that it would be difficult for them to capture Chu Feng given their capabilities.

...

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already left the realm. He had chosen to make a breakthrough in the Seven Realms Galaxy not just to taunt them but to also distract them. The next key fragment he was after was not the one in the Seven Realms Galaxy but the Totem Galaxy.

The best way to cause a commotion in the Seven Realms Galaxy was to induce a heavenly lightning tribulation. That would surely catch the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s notice, and they might even dispatch experts to search for him.

None of them could have known that Chu Feng could cross galaxies in just four to six hours.

On his way to the Totem Galaxy, Chu Feng first constructed a healing formation before unleashing all his means. Soon, he fainted in the healing formation, and it was unknown how long had passed before he regained consciousness.

“There’s indeed a limitation,” Chu Feng remarked with a sigh.

He was able to exert the prowess of a rank two True God when he was at rank six Half-God.

He was curious to know, now that he had made a breakthrough to rank seven Half-God, if his maximum fighting prowess would further rise to rank three True God.

Despite having unleashed all his means, he found that his maximum fighting prowess remained at rank two True God level. This meant that his bloodline ability, God Lightning Bestowment, had a limit to it.

“Elder, has the bloodline ability you imparted to me reached its limit? Or is this my limit?” Chu Feng asked the red lightning beast inside him.

However, the red lightning beast didn’t answer, not wanting to provide him with guidance on this matter. Chu Feng caught the drift and didn’t probe deeper. Regardless, he hoped that it was the latter, as he could still improve and overcome his limitations.

Soon, Chu Feng arrived at the Totem Galaxy, in the realm where the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant was located. However, the remnant was different from what he had expected.
