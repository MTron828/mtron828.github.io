“Elder, I might have to take my leave first,” Chu Feng said after taking a glance at the map.

“Calm down. You’re dealing with the Netherworld Sect here. Are you sure you can deal with the Netherworld Sectmembers who infiltrated the Immortal Sea Fish Clan to capture Little Fishy? There is an army of Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen on standby outside, and the one leading the army is Xianhai Shiyue. Xianhai Shiyue is a rank eight True God level cultivator and a rank seven True Dragon World Spiritist,” the guild leader said.

“Will she allow me to tag along with them?” Chu Feng asked.

“She’s also one of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s higher-ups. She knows about your relationship with Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Yu’er. She should be agreeable to it if I vouch on your behalf. Wait here.”

The guild leader made her way out of the bamboo house. When she walked past Chu Feng, she took back the map she passed to him.

Soon, the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen stationed outside began stirring as if they were preparing to set off.

The guild leader returned and said, “She agreed. Go on.”

Chu Feng and Zi Ling were just about to leave when the guild leader suddenly said, “Zi Ling, you stay behind.”

“Elder...” Zi Ling was reluctant.

“You have been in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy all this while, so you probably don’t know the Netherworld Sect well. On the surface, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is the most feared power in the world of cultivation, but the Netherworld Sect is the sect that no power is willing to offend.

“The Immortal Sea Fish Clan is probably second only to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion in the world of cultivation, but I doubt that they will be a match for the Netherworld if the two of them went to war. It also doesn’t help that the Netherworld Sect is in the shadows, whereas the Immortal Sea Fish Clan is out in the open.

“Zi Ling, I know that you have become strong, but you’ll only be a burden to Chu Feng when dealing with such an entity. You should stay here. I’ll ensure your safety, and Chu Feng will be able to fight at ease without worrying about you,” the guild leader said.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I’ll wait here for you.” Zi Ling understood how dangerous this operation was, and she agreed with the guild leader’s words too.

“All right. I’ll come here to look for you once I’m done with this,” Chu Feng replied.

“Wait a moment,” the guild leader suddenly called out once more.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng turned around and saw two talismans flying toward him. One was a teleportation talisman, and the other was a concealment talisman. Both talismans were extremely potent.

“Don’t use it if you don’t have to. These talismans are extremely expensive,” the guild leader said.

She still ended up helping him despite saying otherwise.

“Elder, I owe you another favor. I’ll surely repay you in the future,” Chu Feng said before heading out to join the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s army.

At the forefront of the army was a white-haired but valiant granny. She looked imposing in her armor.

“Young hero Chu Feng, we finally met. I am Xianhai Shiyue. I watched His Highness Shaoyu and Her Highness Yu’er grow up from a young age. They often speak about you. You... have helped them greatly,” Xianhai Shiyue introduced herself with a smile.

“Junior Chu Feng pays respect to Lord Shiyue.” Chu Feng bowed.

“You’re one of us. There’s no need to stand on ceremony. Let’s talk on the way.”

Xianhai Shiyue immediately set off. On the way, she shared the situation with Chu Feng.

Xianhai Yu’er was cultivating, but thirteen days ago, she suddenly left the Immortal Sea Fish Clan without informing anyone, including Xianhai Shaoyu. Later, it was discovered that her protective formation had shattered.

On top of that, the enemy had prepared a means to disable the formations planted inside Xianhai Yu’er, such that Xianhai Yu’er was unable to contact the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief despite being in danger.

Nevertheless, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief was still able to find some crucial clues via the protective formation through his sharp observation. He was certain that the Netherworld Sect had kidnapped Xianhai Yu’er.

They had no idea why the Netherworld Sect had gone after Xianhai Yu’er, and the Netherworld Sect had made no attempt to contact the Immortal Sea Fish Clan regarding this matter either, which suggested that they intended to keep this matter under wraps.

There was no question that the Netherworld Sect was dangerous, and their behavior was concerning too. So, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan immediately set out to comb all of the possible bases of the Netherworld Sect.

At the same time, they contacted the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild to gather more information about the Netherworld Guild. It just so happened that Chu Feng arrived while they were waiting for the intelligence.

“Lord Shiyue, what’s your plan?” Chu Feng asked.

“Now that we have confirmed they are on Littlelight Upper Realm and Bluesnow Upper Realm, we’ll first seal off those two realms before assaulting them with our army. That’s the only way to deal with the Netherworld Sect.

If Her Highness Yu’er is in neither of those two realms, we’ll capture their upper echelons and interrogate them. If Her Highness is in one of the two realms and they take Her Highness Yu’er hostage, we’ll engage in negotiation with them. Our priority is to ensure Her Highness Yu’er’s safety,” Xianhai Shiyue said.

Chu Feng thought that there was nothing wrong with Xianhai Shiyue’s plan.

They used a special teleportation formation that brought them to outer space instead of into one of the two realms. The two vast realms appeared before Chu Feng’s sight as planetary bodies.

As soon as they arrived, the disciplined Immortal Sea Fish Clan quickly got into their positions and began constructing a formation.

“Sealing formation!” Xianhai Shiyue ordered.

Two formations were simultaneously activated. Two streams of spirit power rushed at the two realms before spreading outward to envelop them. Given the size of the realms, it was bound to take some time before the formations fully enveloped the realms.

These two sealing formations ensured that people could only enter and leave the two realms via the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen’s special teleportation formation.

“Detection formations!” Xianhai Shiyue ordered.

Two more formations shot out as streams of light toward the two realms.

These formations were fused with the Netherworld Sect’s unique aura. As long as there were Netherworld Sectmembers in those two realms, they would be able to find their locations.

Through the detection formation, Chu Feng and the others saw a vast difference between the two realms. Littlelight Upper Realm on the left had millions of light specks, whereas Bluesnow Upper Realm on the right didn’t have a speck of light at all.

“Those channeling the formation stay here and await further orders. The rest shall follow me into Littlelight Upper Realm,” Xianhai Shiyue ordered.

The Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s elite army charged into Littlelight Upper Realm via a teleportation formation.
