Chapter 4463: The First to Arrive

“Chu Hanxian?”

Just hearing that name was more than enough to jolt Chu Feng’s heart. Even with his great self-control, he was unable to calm himself at all.

He was simply too familiar with the name he had just heard.

His grandfather’s name was no other than Chu Hanxian.

Fortunately, he was able to control himself enough to not reveal his agitation on his face.

Besides, given how huge the world of cultivators was, there were plenty of people who shared the same name as one another. Chu Feng had no way to say for certain whether that Chu Hanxian was really his grandfather

That being said, he still couldn’t help but bear some hope regarding this matter.

After all, the first place that his grandfather headed to after leaving the Holy Light Galaxy back then was likely to be the Nine Souls Galaxy. Given so, there was a chance that that place the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke about might really belong to his grandfather.

In any case, Chu Feng was determined to give it a try.

“Elder, may I ask what kind of place that is?” Chu Feng asked the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with an interested tone.

Hearing Chu Feng’s question, the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief reached into his Cosmos Sack and took a map out.

The map was made using the hide of some beast, and it looked like it had many years behind it. It emanated the scent of the Ancient Era.

On top of that, Chu Feng could vaguely sense the presence of some world spiritist technique cast on the map.

When the map was unopened, even Chu Feng was unable to peer into it to see what was recorded on it. His Heaven’s Eye couldn’t see through the map.

Due to this, his interest in it deepened.

“I bought this from a special auction held in Nine Souls Galaxy some time ago. According to the seller, the map leads to a hidden place where a great treasure is buried. I have no idea what the treasure is, but it would appear that it is highly beneficial to cultivators. Feel free to have a look at it.”

As the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he unfurled the map and show it to everyone.

Surprisingly, there didn’t seem to be anything special on the map. All it did was to indicate a certain location.

The location pointed out was the Upper Realm in the Nine Souls Galaxy.

Other than that, there was also a name written on the bottom right corner of the map, and it was the words ‘Chu Hanxian’.

Seeing these words, Chu Feng felt his heart beating even wilder.

“Initially, there were only the words ‘Chu Hanxian’ on the map. According to what I heard from the seller, the map would only reveal the true location of the hidden place when it finally opens. It wasn’t too long ago that the routes finally surfaced on the blank map,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief told the crowd.

“That sounds quite mystical!”

Those from the juniors were awed.

“Interesting!”

Even experts on the caliber of the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster was deeply interested in what the hidden place indicated on the map would hold.

“Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, when are we going to make a move?”

Despite the composed tone of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, the crowd could tell that he could hardly curb his excitement. The very fact that the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief regarded this hidden place so highly was more than enough to show how extraordinary it was.

There was a good chance that they might strike gold here, so how could they, as cultivators, miss such a precious opportunity?

“If everyone is fine with it, my thought is to set off right away. However, I would advise us to don a disguise first. We aren’t in the Holy Light Galaxy but the Nine Souls Galaxy now, so it would be best for us to conceal our identities so as to avoid unnecessary trouble,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Yes, the words of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief rings true.”

The crowd quickly kept their tokens. With a wave of their sleeves, they quickly changed their clothes and altered their appearances.

Some of them, in order to ensure the impeccability of their disguise, even used treasures and put on masks.

In the blink of an eye, everyone already looked different from how they were before.

Only Chu Feng still looked the same way he did.

“Young friend Chu Feng, are you not going to disguise yourself?”

Seeing how Chu Feng wasn’t moving in the least, a person amidst the crowd asked him out of curiosity.

“Elders, I would prefer to use my real face instead,” Chu Feng replied.

“This... I reckon that young friend Chu Feng has his own considerations for making this decision, so let’s go along with it.”

There was no one who voiced their opposition toward Chu Feng’s decision. After everything that had happened, they were well aware that Chu Feng was no fool.

On the contrary, he was very sharp-witted, and it was likely that he had his reasons for doing so.

However, what the crowd didn’t know was that Chu Feng would love more than anything to disguise himself too, but it was just that he didn’t dare to due to a certain mysterious person who kidnapped Zhao Hong threatening him not to disguise himself.

With all preparations in order, the Monstrous Herd Temple, Yu Heavenly Clan, Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Dragon Clan, and Chu Feng finally set off with their eyes locked on the hidden place indicated on the map.

Based on the map, the hidden place which the cultivator named Chu Hanxian had left behind in was located in the midst of a remote mountain range.

However, when they finally arrived in the vicinity, before they could even see the mountain range, they suddenly found themselves unable to proceed any further in.

A massive translucent barrier of white light that rose from the ground to the boundless sky had sealed off the place entirely.

Someone had used a treasure to blockade the area off.

However, it just happened that the place Chu Feng and the others needed to head to was beyond the barrier. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

And to make things worse, they found that a huge crowd had gathered within the barrier. These people didn’t seem to be affiliated with one another. Rather, they seemed more like onlookers spectating a commotion.

Facing such a situation before them, Chu Feng and the others couldn’t help but frown in worry.

Could it be that someone had beat them to the hidden place?
