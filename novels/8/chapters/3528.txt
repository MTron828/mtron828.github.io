Chapter 3528 - The Cunning Chu Feng

“Something’s fishy about that compass!”

The crowd realized that it was the compass that had sucked away Chu Feng’s spirit power.

It turned out, it was all a plot by Kong Tianhui.

“This is bad,” Many people began to worry for Chu Feng.

After all, they knew that Chu Feng’s cultivation had actually not reached the Exalted realm. The only reason why he was able to tie with Linghu Hongfei was due to his world spirit techniques.

Now that his spirit power had been sealed, he would not be able to unleash his battle power.

No, there was still a chance. Chu Feng still had that world spirit.

The strongest aspect regarding Chu Feng was not his world spirit techniques. Instead, it was that world spirit of his.

Back then, it was precisely that world spirit that had fought Linghu Hongfei to a stalemate.

However, at the moment when the crowd thought that Chu Feng still had a chance to turn the situation around, Kong Tianhui suddenly spoke. “To only realize this now is already too late,"

“This compass of mine is especially used to restrain world spiritists. Not only is Chu Feng unable to utilize his world spirit techniques, but he will also not be able to open his world spirit gate either.”

“I know very well that the only reason why Chu Feng was able to obtain the first ranked spot in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars was due to his Asura World Spirit.”

“Indeed, that world spirit is very powerful, and I am no match for her.”

“That is the reason why I had you fight me atop this compass.”

“Chu Feng, now do you understand why I said that you’ve lost the moment you stepped onto this compass?”

“I admit that you’re quite talented. Unfortunately, you lack brains,” Kong Tianhui looked at Chu Feng, and a complacent expression filled his eyes.

“Young master Kong, if you are to do it like that, you would have won the match unfairly,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was clearly furious. He was originally very courteous toward Kong Tianhui. However, his tone was now no longer as courteous as it was before.

After all, Kong Tianhui was plotting against his most favored clansman, Chu Feng.

“I only care about winning. As for whether or not we actually fight, this young master simply doesn’t care,” Kong Tianhui spoke with an indifferent expression on his face. His appearance was very infuriating to look at.

At that moment, the crowd realized that although Kong Tianhui’s talent was pretty decent, his moral character was not up to much at all.

He was simply a shameless and despicably vile individual. Furthermore, his degree of shamelessness was quite high too, as his skin had already grown exceptionally thick.

That Kong Tianhui was not at all like the genius of the Divine Body Royal City in their imagination.

“Young master Kong, even if you manage to defeat young friend Chu Feng by relying on that compass, you are actually not a match for him. Once you leave the compass, you won’t be able to defeat him at all. You know it very well yourself. Even if you win today, what significance will it serve? You will only be deceiving others, and deceiving yourself,” said Tantai Yinjiang.

This was actually what the majority of the crowd thought as well.

However, Kong Tianhui still acted completely indifferent. He said, “I’m satisfied as long as I defeat that Chu Feng.”

The crowd felt helpless seeing Kong Tianhui acting like that. As the saying went; shameless individuals cannot be rivaled. Kong Tianhui was truly shameless to the extreme.

With the situation being like that, the crowd began to look towards Chu Feng with sympathy, and even distress.

If Chu Feng was truly no match for Kong Tianhui, then so be it if he was defeated.

However, if he was to be defeated in such a manner, it would be truly too unworthy.

“Hahaha...”

To the crowd’s surprise, Chu Feng burst into sudden laughter.

“What are you laughing about?” asked Kong Tianhui.

“Young master Kong, I am truly sorry,” said Chu Feng.

“What?” Kong Tianhui revealed a look of confusion upon hearing those words.

“What I did earlier was actually on purpose,” said Chu Feng.

“On purpose? With what?” Kong Tianhui looked even more confused.

It was not only Kong Tianhui who was confused. Even the others present were quite puzzled by his words.

“You don’t understand? That’s alright. You’ll soon understand.”

Chu Feng smiled in a very strange manner. Then, his body shifted as he shot out a punch explosively.

Martial power surged forth like a tide. ‘Bang!’ Kong Tianhui was caught off-guard, and knocked flying thousands of meters away from the compass.

“This aura...”

“It’s rank one Exalted!!!”

At that moment, in addition to the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and the Chu Heavenly Clan, even the various powers that came to offer congratulations were completely astonished.

That said, in terms of feeling the most astonished, it would be none other than Kong Tianhui.

“How could this be?! Wasn’t your cultivation... supposed to be that of a Martial Immortal?”

Kong Tianhui stood in the distant sky with a look of astonishment as he looked towards Chu Feng.

“Indeed, my cultivation was that of a Martial Immortal back in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.”

“To be exact, my cultivation was that of a rank seven Martial Immortal. That said, why can’t I increase my cultivation?” Chu Feng asked.

“What sort of nonsense are you spouting?”

“Who did you think you are? Do you think cultivation is so easily increased?”

Kong Tianhui turned pale with anger.

He simply did not believe that Chu Feng would be able to increase his cultivation from rank seven Martial Immortal to rank one Exalted in such a short period of time. After all, this would be simply too quick.

Thus, he felt that Chu Feng was toying with him. That was the reason why he became so furious.

In fact, he was not the only one who did not believe Chu Feng. The others also did not believe him.

It was as Kong Tianhu had said, it was indeed practically impossible to make so many breakthroughs in cultivation in such a short period of time.

Thus, the crowd felt that it might be possible that Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation from the very start.

However, none of that mattered anymore. Regardless of whether Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation long ago, or if he had gained successive breakthroughs later on, it was no longer important.

What was important was that Chu Feng had forced Kong Tianhui off of the compass.

The match had ended with Chu Feng’s victory.

Such an ending caused the crowd to have a feeling... of great satisfaction!!!

“Chu Feng, you are truly despicable. You actually concealed your cultivation,” Kong Tianhui was unwilling to drop the subject, and was cursing Chu Feng out.

However, Chu Feng was not angered. He merely spread his hands in a helpless manner. “There’s nothing I can do if you don’t trust me.”

He had the appearance of ‘What can you possibly do about it?’

Seeing Chu Feng like that, Kong Tianhui grew even more furious. He came to a sudden discovery that Chu Feng seemed to be extremely shameless too.

“Never did I expect you to be this shameless too. It would appear that I had miscalculated,” as matters stood, no matter how unreconciled Kong Tianhui might be, he had no choice but to face the truth. In the end, he had been defeated.

That said, it seemed that Kong Tianhui was much more thick-skinned than the crowd imagined him to be. After a sigh, he suddenly burst into laughter. “That said, this could only be considered to be a tie. After all, I had used that compass precisely so that you could make a fool of yourself. As for that goal of mine, I’ve already accomplished it.”

“A tie?”

“I’m afraid that you’re overthinking things, no?” said Chu Feng.

“Heh... Me, overthinking? Ask yourself this: how does it feel to have your spirit power sucked away by the compass,” Kong Tianhui spoke mockingly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“It’s alright. After all, I was prepared for it. Thus, it’s nothing too serious,” said Chu Feng.

“Prepared for it? What do you mean?” Kong Tianhui revealed a confused look.

“I mean that I had already seen through the fact that your compass was fishy. I deliberately released my spirit power so that it could absorb it,” said Chu Feng.

“Bullshit! Don’t you try to find a pretext for your own carelessness. Do you think we’re all fools that would believe your nonsense?” Not only did Kong Tianhui have a look of disbelief, he was looking at Chu Feng as if he were looking at a fool. He felt that the excuse Chu Feng had provided was simply too rudimentary.

However, Chu Feng replied in an indifferent manner, “There’s no need for me to find a pretext.”

“Then tell me, how did you know that my compass was fishy? Furthermore, why did you decide to deliberately put on an act? Why don’t you give me a reason to trust your words?” said Kong Tianhui.

“That’s very simple. If I didn’t do that, how would I let the crowd know that you, young master Kong, are such a shameless person?” Chu Feng suddenly smiled. That smile of his was so sly and cunning.

“Motherfucker! You fucking plotted against this young master!” At that moment, Kong Tianhui came to a sudden realization. It turned out that he had fallen for Chu Feng’s scheme.

“This young master shall take your lousy life!”

“Zzzzz~~~”

Suddenly, a ray of lightning appeared and cut through the skies.

It was Kong Tianhui. Filled with anger, he rushed straight at Chu Feng with overflowing killing intent.
