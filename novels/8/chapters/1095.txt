MGA: Chapter 1096 - The Battle Between Geniuses

“No wonder you dare to be this arrogant. It turns out that you actually have some skills.”

“Very well. Since this is the case, I shall not show any mercy either. Let’s quickly settle this.”

Bai Ruochen coldly snorted. Then, light flickered on her palm and a long scaled whip that shined with silvery light appeared in her hand.

Once this long whip appeared, a strong gale immediately started to torrent through the region and black clouds began to appear. The martial power in the surroundings also began to flutter up and down. Even the ground began to tremble.

At this moment, Bai Ruochen’s white dress was fluttering in the wind and her long hair was swaying back and forth. After she explosively increased her strength, even this region of empty space started to change with her at the center. It was as if her might had conquered this region of space.

That long whip was entirely white in color. However, it emitted a silvery light. Furthermore, the scales on the whip appeared extremely vivid and lifelike. They did not appear to be something that was added to the whip afterwards; instead they appeared like they were originally a part of it.

This long whip possessed intelligence; it was a Royal Armament. However, it was not an ordinary Royal Armament. The might displayed by it was able to match Chu Feng’s Demon Sealing Sword.

“What a powerful Royal Armament. Is this eldest senior sister’s legendary Platinum Dragon Whip?”

“Truly too amazing. That whip is a king among Royal Armaments. Before it, ordinary Royal Armaments would tremble in fear, unable to fight against it at all.”

“That Southern Cyanwood Forest’s disciple possessed some tricks and abilities that we have never seen before. I suspect he likely also possesses an extraordinary Royal Armament. Unfortunately for him, regardless of what sort of Royal Armament he possesses, it would not be able to exhibit its strength before eldest senior sister’s Platinum Dragon Whip. It would appear that the outcome of this battle is already decided.”

When they saw the Platinum Dragon Whip, the disciples of the Ascension Sect began to praise incessantly. They have already experienced how powerful Bai Ruochen’s Platinum Dragon Whip was.

“Receive my attack!!!”

Suddenly, Bai Ruochen attacked. She waved her sleeve and did a graceful motion, brandishing the Platinum Dragon Whip in her hand. “Pow,” a sharp echo, like a bolt from the blue. As the whip gave off that explosive sound, a white colored dragon appeared. With snarls, it charged toward Chu Feng.

“This Bai Ruochen is indeed extraordinary. She actually possessed a Royal Armament not inferior to my Demon Sealing Sword.” Seeing the incoming white dragon, Chu Feng’s eyes shined. However, he did not panic.

Although Chu Feng’s battle power was extraordinary, his cultivation was limited. Right now, after using both his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, his cultivation was only able to match Bai Ruochen’s.

As for Bai Ruochen, she immediately took out a Royal Armament not inferior to his Demon Sealing Sword. This caused it so that the gap that Chu Feng had closed to become inferior once again. In this sort of situation, Chu Feng had no choice but to go all out.

“Buzz.” Thinking till this point, Chu Feng did not hesitate anymore. With a turn of his wrist, the pitch-black Demon Sealing Sword appeared in his hand.

“Rumble~~~”

Once the Demon Sealing Sword appeared, the sky instantly turned dark and thunders rolled about. Most importantly, layers upon layers of black gases charged forth from the Demon Sealing Sword. Like an army of demons, they rushed to attack the incoming white dragon from all sides.

“Wuuuuu~~~~~~~”

“Aoooouuu~~~~~~~~”

The white dragon roared repeatedly, trembling the surroundings. As for the black colored gases, they howled like demons and ghosts unceasingly. If the dragon’s roar brought about fear to the crowd, then the howls of the gas brought about terror to their hearts.

As the two fought in the sky, a black and white battle scene appeared. It was an extremely spectacular sight.

“What is that? That guy’s Royal Armament is actually also this powerful? It is actually not at all inferior to eldest senior sister’s Platinum Dragon Whip?”

“How could this be? Who exactly is he? Where did he obtain such a powerful Royal Armament?”

Once Chu Feng’s Demon Sealing Sword appeared, he immediately brought about the focus of the crowd. After all, the Demon Sealing Sword’s might was matchlessly powerful too. It could be said that the Demon Sealing Sword was not in the slightest inferior to Bai Ruochen’s Platinum Dragon Whip.

Royal Armaments like those are known to be the kings among Royal Armaments. They were simply not something that ordinary world spiritists could craft. Even in the Holy Land of Martialism, they were invaluable items, treasures that everyone wanted to purchase but could not find.

Treasures like those were items that would only be held bye geniuses of major powers. As for Chu Feng, he was merely a Southern Cyanwood Forest’s disciple. Yet, he actually possessed such a Royal Armament. This naturally brought about a great deal of shock to the crowd.

However, at this moment, the crowd was unable to remain stunned by Chu Feng’s Demon Sealing Sword for long because the battle between Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen became more and more intense, reaching a point beyond their imagination.

From a simple contest of Royal Armaments, the two had moved onto a battle with martial skills. Moreover, neither of them were simply using a single martial skill. Instead, they were using multiple martial skills at once.

All kinds of offensive and defensive martial skills appeared in the sky only to be dissipated by their opponent nonstop. That sort of scene brought about amazement to even Sikong Zhaixing. There was no need to mention what the two Ascension Sect’s elders and ninety-nine disciples felt at this moment.

The battle between Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen had surpassed the capabilities of ordinary disciples. What the two of them displayed was simply the battle techniques and methods of exceptional geniuses.

This was a battle between geniuses!!!

“Unbelievable! Never did I imagine Chu Feng to be this powerful!”

“Ancestor, you were right, you were right! Our Southern Cyanwood Forest has finally managed to wait till the appearance of our hope! All these countless years of waiting has finally paid off!”

At this moment, Sikong Zhaixing was extremely emotional. His aged body even began to tremble. Although he knew that Chu Feng was powerful, he never imagined Chu Feng to be this powerful. Such battle strength, he believed that even the top geniuses of the Cyanwood Mountain would only be at his level.

“Damn it. I refuse to believe that I, Bai Ruochen, cannot defeat you today!”

With her attacks being dissipated by Chu Feng repeatedly, this caused the proud, arrogant and icy cold Bai Ruochen to become even more furious. After being enraged to such a state, her aura began to change. Layers upon layers of special aura began to spill out from her palm and was quietly channeled into the Platinum Dragon Whip.

“This feeling! She has trained in a special kind of Mysterious Technique. If my guess is correct, it should be a Forbidden Mysterious Technique. No wonder her battle power is this powerful. So there’s actually the assistance of a Forbidden Mysterious Technique.” Chu Feng was extremely sensitive. He noticed that the aura emitted by Bai Ruochen at this moment was a bit different. It was a power completely different from the norm, a power that originated from Forbidden Mysterious Techniques. In essence, the current Bai Ruochen became even more powerful.

“I shall see how you take on this attack of mine, Dragon Whipping The World!”

Suddenly, the Platinum Dragon Whip Bai Ruochen held in her hand shined like the dazzling sun, and at this moment, it was brandished once again in her hand. Layers upon layers of frightening power was channeling through the Platinum Dragon Whip. As if that power was about to emerge out from it, even the surrounding space started to violently tremble.

“Bang!”

Finally, a sound even more ear-piercing than thunder exploded in the sky. At the same time, the Platinum Dragon Whip twitched in the sky. After the twitching stopped, layers upon layers of spatial cracks appeared in the sky. Finally, the cracks split apart and created a pitch-black darkness.

“It would appear that she’s not holding anything back now.”

Seeing the sky that had been split apart, Chu Feng also frowned. Everything in the Holy Land of Martialism was different from the Eastern Sea Region. The sky here was taller and the space was more stable. It was simply impossible for ordinary power to shatter the space here. However, at this moment, Bai Ruochen had shattered it. This meant that she possessed extraordinary power.

She was displaying her might; she was displaying to Chu Feng how powerful the current her was. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In this sort of situation, Chu Feng did not dare to be careless. He tightly held the Demon Sealing Sword; then he channeled his martial power in his body through a special trajectory and into the Demon Sealing Sword. That was because he knew that the next time Bai Ruochen attack would no longer be a display of her might. Instead, the attack would be aimed at him.
