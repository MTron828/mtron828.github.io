Chapter 4110 - Demon Vanquishing Clan

“My clan has existed since the Ancient Era.”

“We are called the Demon Vanquishing Clan,” said the old granny.

“Demon Vanquishing Clan?!”

The curiosity in Chu Feng’s eyes grew even more intense.

Merely by hearing the name, he knew that the clan was very remarkable.

Then, after hearing the old granny’s narrative, Chu Feng learned about the Demon Vanquishing Clan’s origin.

The Demon Vanquishing Clan was a clan from the Ancient Era.

The mysterious technique that the people from the Demon Vanquishing Clan trained in was different from that of other cultivators.

For other cultivators, the purpose of their mysterious techniques was to increase their cultivations.

However, it was different for the Demon Vanquishing Clan. The purpose of the mysterious technique they trained in was to restrain monsters and demons.

Adding on their special bloodline power, it made it so that whilst the Demon Vanquishing Clan might not have the strongest martial cultivators, they were capable of curbing monsters, demons, ferocious beasts, natural oddities and other special beings.

This was especially true in regards to the Demon Vanquishing Talisman passed on by their ancestors.

The Demon Vanquishing Talisman required the Demon Vanquishing Clan’s bloodline power and the Demon Vanquishing Mysterious Technique to use.

In terms of cultivation, the old granny’s granddaughter’s cultivation was far weaker than hers.

However, through the use of the Demon Vanquishing Talisman, she had been able to save Chu Feng from the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast’s stomach.

From that, one could see how powerful the Demon Vanquishing Talisman was.

After all, Chu Feng had witnessed with his very eyes how terrifying an existence that Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beast was.

“Granny, are the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts scourges to people?” asked Chu Feng.

“We cultivators now rule over all the places in the world.”

“The Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts are creatures that seek out cultivators with powerful bloodlines to devour. That is their method of training.”

“As such, they are naturally scourges to people,” said the old granny.

“Since the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts are that abominable and your Demon Vanquishing Clan possesses the means to curb them, why don’t you eliminate them completely?” asked Chu Feng.

“Eliminate them completely?”

“Our ancestors had indeed thought about eradicating the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts.”

“However, later on, they thought that even though the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts devour cultivators to train, aren’t we cultivators also beings that refine natural oddies to train?”

“Are we cultivators alive, but those natural oddies with intelligence not?”

“Even if we are to ignore cultivators, what about the ordinary people in the Lower Realms? Aren’t the livestock that they eat also lives?”

“Even the flowers and trees, the vegetation, are alive.”

“As long as we are able to utilize the living beings of this world, we will definitely not hesitate.”

“Apart from killing fellow clansmen being a criminal offense, cultivators are able to kill everything before them.”

“In the end, we only uphold our own interests.”

“If we are to put ourselves in the shoes of other creatures, aren’t we cultivators also terrifying demonic beings?” said the old granny.

“Mn... that is reasonable.” Chu Feng nodded in agreement.

“That is the cruelty of this world.”

“When we are weak, we can only allow ourselves to be bullied and humiliated by ferocious beasts.”

“Later on, we learned how to cultivate. With that, we became powerful, and became the masters of the vast starry sky.”

“Since ancient times, the world has been one where the weak are prey to the strong. That is the law of nature.”

“That law is also one that keeps the balance between all living beings.”

“Since we’ve become powerful, we possess the qualifications to manage everything.”

“As such, foreign matters detrimental to us shall be eliminated. There’s nothing wrong with that, and we have no need to blame ourselves either.”

“If we are excessively charitable, not only will it bring about our own end, but it will also cause others to perish.”

“Excessive charity will harm both others and oneself. Following the law of things is the actual truth.”

“But, our clan’s ancestors said that since the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts exist, there must be a reason for their existence.”

“As such, we are not allowed to eradicate them.”

“Of course, while our old ancestors didn’t want to eradicate them, it is different for our generation.”

“For us, even if we wanted to eradicate them, we are unable to do so.”

“Our Demon Vanquishing Clan has already fallen. The disparity between us and the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts has grown wider and wider.”

“Even though our Demon Vanquishing Talisman is still capable of curbing them, we are unable to eliminate them.”

“As you can see from our infrastructure, you can imagine how prosperous we were in the past.”

“Yet now... only our generation of three remains.”

The old granny had a bitter smile on her face as she said those words.

She seemed to not have any hatred for the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts, yet, she felt very powerless.

Her powerlessness came from the fact that her clan had fallen. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Chu Feng chatted with the old granny about some more things.

During their conversation Chu Feng tried to inquire about the Ancient Era.

After all, the Demon Vanquishing Clan was a family of survivors from the Ancient Era.

Chu Feng felt that the old granny might have some clues about the Ancient Era.

However, to Chu Feng’s disappointment the old granny didn’t know anything about the Ancient Era.

All that she knew were things her forefathers had told her.

In terms of the Ancient Era, it seemed that her knowledge was even less than Chu Feng’s.

At least Chu Feng knew that a calamity had occurred in the Ancient Era, but the old granny didn’t know about that at all.

Seeing that he would not be able to gain any information and considering that Long Daozhi would most likely think he was dead, Chu Feng decided that in order to keep Long Daozhi from being worried he should leave.

After expressing his thanks Chu Feng finally asked, “Granny, may I know where the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation might be?”

“Teleportation formation? We have that.”

“But young man, where do you want to go?” asked the old granny.

“This junior is going to the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm to meet up with my friends,” Chu Feng replied honestly.

“Young man, do you know why our Demon Vanquishing Clan was able to move about the world unhindered in the past, but ended up staying here with the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts and becoming their old enemy later on?” asked the old granny.

Chu Feng was actually also very curious about this so he asked, “Why?”

“That’s because this Heaven-devouring Realm is already separated from the outside world.”

“Not only are the people outside unable to see us, but we are also unable to go outside.”

“Since you’ve entered this place, it means that you can only spend the rest of your life here,” said the old granny.

“What? Trapped here?”

“Granny, is there a way to get out?” asked Chu Feng.

“There’s no way out.”

“Amongst our ancestors there were many Martial Exalted-level experts.”

“There were also an innumerable number of world spiritists superior to myself.”

“Throughout their entire lives, they searched for a method to leave this place.”

“Unfortunately, they were unable to find it,” said the old granny.

“......”

“How could that be?”

Chu Feng narrowed his brows after hearing what the old granny had said.

Ignoring the fact that he needed to help Long Daozhi, if he were to get trapped in there, it would mean that he would be cut off from the rest of the world, and would no longer be able to see his close friends from the olden days.

He would also never be able to meet his mother and grandfather.

“No, I must leave this place.”

Because of that, the first thought that came into Chu Feng’s mind was to leave.

Even if there was no way out, he still had to think of a way out.

Suddenly, Chu Feng thought of a crucial question, “Wait, something’s strange. Granny, if it’s impossible to leave, then how did that Ancient Era’s ferocious beast leave?”

It wasn’t that he had entered their world on his own. Instead, he had been captured and brought there by the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts.

As the Ancient Era’s Heaven-devouring Beasts were creatures of the isolated world, it meant that since it was able to go out, there was a way to leave.
