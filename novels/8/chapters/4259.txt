Chapter 4259 - Great Shock

“Woosh, woosh, woosh---”

Light began to shoot out from the balls of light. Those lights were shooting straight toward the people that had cast their consciousness into the balls of light.

The white light crisscrossed one another. Like a giant net of light, they covered the entire sky.

Once the light landed on the crowd’s bodies, a faint layer of light covered everyone present.

That was the portion of power they received from Lu Jie.

While the reward was very meager like what the crowd expected, the crowd were still very joyous.

The reason for that was because those bodies of light had covered their bodies. Even without the need to refine them, those bodies of light will automatically assimilate with their bodies.

At this moment, they were all able to clearly sense the power contained within those bodies of light.

To world spiritists like them, it was an enormous assistance.

It will greatly increase their spirit power.

“This trip has truly not been made in vain, truly not been made in vain.”

“Thank you young hero Lu Jie, thank you young hero Lu Jie.”

Jubilance filled the air. But, more than that, the crowd was thanking Lu Jie.

There were a lot of people that came to the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain. However, the majority of them were merely here to speculate, here to get in on the action.

As they knew their own strength, they were not delusional in believing that they would be able to obtain the inheritance of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

Yet now, they actually received this power. It was most definitely a pleasant surprise.

This pleasant surprise was brought to them by Lu Jie.

It was Lu Jie who bestowed them with this power and opportunity.

As such, it was only natural that they would be enormously grateful toward Lu Jie, so much that they’re shedding tears with mucus covered faces.

No matter how haughty or conceited Lu Jie might be, no matter how displeased they might be with his personality, he had become the crowd’s, these hundreds of millions of people present’s, hero.

Sensing the deafening praises and voices of thanks that filled the sky, Lu Jie, although cold and aloof, was unable to conceal his happiness and was grinning from ear to ear.

He was feeling immensely proud of himself.

Even though he was a genius renowned throughout the Holy Light Galaxy to begin with, it was still the first time that he had received this sort of treatment.

He knew that his status in the crowd’s heart will change after today.

That said, he did not forget to look at Chu Feng.

After seeing that the balls of light around Chu Feng did not undergo any change, Lu Jie narrowed his eyes and took great delight in Chu Feng’s misfortune.

“Chu Feng, what’s going on with you? Why aren’t there any signs of activity?”

“Could it be that the light around your body is no reward at all?” Lu Jie spoke sarcastically.

“That’s true. Why is there no sign of activity with Chu Feng?”

“Hahaha. Could it really be as Lu Jie said and that light around Chu Feng was no reward at all?”

“That’s very possible. Look at how weak he looked. It might even be possible that he had never really breached the chess formation.”

“Besides, the red light around him does not possess any aura of spirit power. One could tell with only looking at it that it is not a power that will increase everyone’s spirit power.”

“But, if he didn’t breach the chess formation, how did he exit the chess formation?”

“That’s simple. Even we were rescued after Lu Jie breached his chess formation, that Chu Feng would naturally not be an exception.”

“Thus, after all this, that Chu Feng had never breached his chess formation at all. Instead, he was only able to escape from the chess formation alive thanks to Lu Jie.”

“That’s most likely the case.”

“Haha. So that’s the case.”

“Those fools actually thought that they would be able to obtain a distribution of the rewards from Chu Feng?”

“They think themselves to be clever. Served them right.”

Cutting remarks and ridicules toward Chu Feng sounded from the surroundings.

Even those people who chose to receive an equal distribution of Chu Feng’s rewards were being implicated by the crowd’s cutting remarks.

Hearing the mockeries and insults that filled the sky, Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu were all gnashing their teeth furiously.

If they didn’t have any misgivings, they would truly teach those people a ruthless lesson.

“Does that guy possess a heart of steel?”

“How could he remain this calm, composed and completely unaffected facing all these insults?”

Compared to the furious Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu, Yu Ting was staring at Chu Feng. Confusion filled her heart.

She discovered that Chu Feng had never been angered by those malicious words the entire time.

“He’s actually smiling?”

Suddenly, Yu Ting’s eyes opened wide. The shock on her face grew even stronger.

Chu Feng was smiling. This was not the first time Chu Feng smiled since he exited the chess formation.

“Everyone, I thank you all for your confidence in me.”

“Although I, Chu Feng, did not breach that chess formation for you all, but since you all were confident in me, you all are qualified to receive some reward.”

“This is my reward to you all,” Chu Feng spoke loudly.

His words were clearly aimed at the several thousand people that chose to share his reward.

“What is he talking about?”

“Has he gone mad?”

“He’s actually having delusions about sharing rewards with others?”

“Could it be that he still doesn’t know the red light on his body was simply not a reward from the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain?”

The mocking expressions on the people that were insulting Chu Feng grew even stronger after hearing Chu Feng’s sudden words.

At this moment, Chu Feng was no longer the dazzling demon-level genius from before.

Instead, he had become a clown to them.

The reason for this change was because they received benefits from Lu Jie whereas they believed Chu Feng nearly killed them.

That said, Chu Feng ignored all those mocking voices. He acted as if he cannot hear them.

Then, he closed his eyes.

Suddenly, Chu Feng opened his eyes.

At the same time, his clothes started fluttering. Then, the red light covering him started to spread from his body. In no time at all, the thin layer of red light expanded to a range of a hundred meters.

Furthermore, it began to assimilate with a portion of the spheres of light. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Woosh, woosh, woosh---”

After assimilating with them, the blood-red colored light shot out of the balls of light.

Like reverse meteors, the blood-red light shot straight toward the people that chose Chu Feng.

Seeing this scene, the crowd, including even those that had chosen Chu Feng, all turned pale with fright.

Even though those red lights had not reached them, the dazzling degree far surpassed the white light that Lu Jie shared with the crowd.

Every single red light was tens of times thicker than the white light Lu Jie shared with the crowd.

Furthermore, this was only the beginning.

It was only after the red lights landed on their bodies that the crowd were truly stunned.

The light that seemed to possess no spirit power at all started to emit an extremely rich and abundant amount of spirit power aura the moment they landed on the crowd.

The aura was tens of times more intense than Lu Jie’s white light.

Most importantly, Lu Jie’s light, when split among the crowd of hundreds of millions, made it so that everyone, regardless of whether it be Grandmaster Luo Tuo, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted or other nameless individuals, only received a small and meager amount.

But, the red light shared by Chu Feng was completely different.

Not only was its aura very strong, its size was also enormous.
