Chapter 3957 - Internecine Strife

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, the entrance to the room shattered.

Then, all of the Mystic Cave Saints rushed in.

The instant they rushed in, they immediately looked to Chu Feng nervously.

“Brother Asura, are you alright?”

The Mystic Cave Saints rushed in because they’d heard Chu Feng’s scream.

After they rushed in, they saw that he was on the ground. Immediately, they became even more worried.

Chu Feng was not only lying on the ground, but his complexion was also very bad. This was especially true in regards to his eyes -- fear was present in them.

They’d known Chu Feng for some time now. Yet, they had never seen fear in his eyes.

Because of that, they became even more worried. They all felt that he had encountered some sort of mishap.

“It’s alright. I’ve merely encountered a minor problem,” said Chu Feng.

“Problem? You don’t look to be fine at all.”

The Mystic Cave Saints refused to believe Chu Feng.

“It’s really nothing. Actually, I’ve already succeeded.”

“Have a look.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he not only stood back up, but he also released his spirit power.

Chu Feng released his spirit power very casually. His spirit power coiled around his hand like a little snake.

However, this mere strand of spirit power stunned all the Mystic Cave Saints. Their eyes were all shining.

“Dragon Mark Saint-cloak.”

“Hell! Brother Asura, you actually really succeeded.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“You’ve managed to comprehend that treasure from the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.”

“Your comprehension ability is truly astonishing.”

“Right, right. Although we knew that treasure was capable of providing enormous help to those below Dragon Mark Saint-cloak, time is needed to comprehend the treasure.”

“But, judging from the timing of things, you haven’t had this treasure for a long time, no?”

“Amazing. Brother Asura, you are simply the most talented world spiritist I’ve ever met.”

The Mystic Cave Saints praised Chu Feng nonstop. They looked as if they were openly flattering him.

However, they were actually not trying to flatter him. It was just that they’d heard how difficult it was to comprehend the treasure. Thus, they were praising him from the bottom of their hearts.

Although the Mystic Cave Saints were all feeling happy for Chu Feng, Chu Feng felt somewhat ashamed.

“It’s truly unfortunate that I am unable to have you all comprehend that gem too.”

“Furthermore, I am also unable to convey the mysteries I obtained from it.” Chu Feng sighed helplessly.

The reason why he sighed was because their original objective in proceeding for the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb was for that treasure, that gem.

However, in the end, due to a freak combination of factors, only Chu Feng himself obtained the gem. Furthermore, only he could train using it.

It was as if he had enjoyed all the benefits for himself.

Naturally, he would feel that he had let down and betrayed the Mystic Cave Saints.

The Mystic Cave Saints said with smiles on their faces, “Brother Asura, we are brothers, there’s no need for you to take us as if we’re strangers.”

“It was through your own ability that you were able to obtain the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s inheritance.”

“Let’s not think about the things of the past. Right now, there are quite a lot of treasures in the All-heaven Sect that we still haven’t seen. Furthermore, what we can do right now is truly limited. We will have to rely on you.”

“Right, what’s in the past is in the past. Let’s capture the opportunity before us, that would be better than anything else.”

Even though the Mystic Cave Saints valued treasures as much as their lives, they were also reasonable. At least, they were very reasonable with Chu Feng.

“Rest assured, regardless of what sort of treasure it might be, regardless of what sort of ability it might possess, I, Chu Feng, will definitely obtain it for you all,” guaranteed Chu Feng.

He had truly made a firm resolution. He was not only doing this for only the treasure, or to take care of the All-heaven Sect; he was also doing this for the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Someone’s coming.”

Suddenly, the expressions of the Mystic Cave Saints and Chu Feng all changed.

All of them sensed that there were people flying towards them.

They immediately set up a spirit formation that concealed them within the house, making it so that others could not detect them. They also used their respective observation techniques to look outward.

It was only then that they discovered that there was actually a group of younger generations outside.

There were both men and women among them. Their number totaled seven.

They were wearing the same attire. Their attire resembled daoist gowns. On their backs were engraved totem-like symbols resembling wind and lightning.

Most importantly, they were all carrying identical-looking swords on their backs.

Lightning was rushing out from their swords.

“Wind Lightning Sword Sect.”

Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints all knew the identities of those people.

Their attires were simply too distinctive. Even though it was the first time Chu Feng had seen them, he was able to guess their identities -- people from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect, the Wind Lightning Starfield’s overlord.

The people from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect all had a Wind Lightning Sword on them.

Their Wind Lightning Sword could be activated through special hand seals to release wind and lightning.

That said, the Wind Lightning Swords were not merely a symbol of their identity. They were also special treasures.

The Wind Lightning Swords could be used to set up a Wind Lightning Sword Formation, which was reportedly extremely powerful.

All that being said, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints noticed that those seven people, although all from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect, seemed to not have a harmonious relationship.

Six of them seemed to be a group.

As for the other person, the other six were forcibly grabbing his arm, forcibly bringing him with them.

“This place will do.”

The man leading the group said those words and began to descend.

The cultivation of those seven were not weak at all. They were all Martial Immortals. Among people of the younger generation, their cultivations were very decent.

Especially the tan-skinned man leading the bunch, his cultivation was actually that of a rank nine Martial Immortal.

After landing, the other disciples ordered the disciple that they’d forcibly brought with them. “Kneel.”

“If you want to kill me or torture me, do as you please. But for me to kneel, that’ll be impossible.”

The disciple that was forcibly brought over by his fellow disciples was not only handsome, but he was also someone with a tough backbone.

Even though his cultivation was clearly weaker than that of the other six, even though he’d already been forcibly brought there by them, he showed no fear at all.

“Kneel!”

Suddenly, the man leading the six raised his leg and kicked.

A ‘snap’ was heard, and the handsome man’s legs were broken.

With this, no matter how unwilling the handsome man was, his body still leaned forward onto the ground.

That said, even though his legs had been broken, he actually gritted his teeth, and did not even let out the slightest groan of pain.

Although the handsome man was so unyielding, the other six did not view him in a new light at all. Instead, they all mocked and ridiculed him. Even the women were filled with hostility towards him.

“Song Xiao, as we are fellow disciples, I did not want to make things difficult for you.”

“As long as you keep your distance from junior sister Bai, I will pretend that nothing has happened,” said the male disciple that seemed to be the leader.

“Wang Chen, all of us like junior sister Bai. If you want to make her yours, why don’t you do so with your abilities? I, Song Xiao, do not fear your threats.”

That Wang Chen was naturally the male leading the bunch.

Hearing all that, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints realized what was happening.

Evidently, the reason why those disciples were having a fall out was because of a female disciple surnamed Bai.

“Sure enough, beauties, since ancient times, are the source of calamity.”

“Fortunately, we brothers are not lecherous. Else, we too would have internecine strife,” the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints said with a sigh.

“Paa~~~”

“Aiyo.”

However, right after Eleventh said those words, he let out a scream.

It was the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. He had knocked Eleventh in the head.

Not only that, he also angrily reprimanded Eleventh, “What sort of bullshit are you spouting?! How could we brothers have conflicts with one another for the sake of a mere woman?!”

“Aiya, I’m only making a joke. Big brother, you mustn’t take me seriously,” said Eleventh.

“You can make any sort of joke you want, but you cannot joke about the affection between us brothers!” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

The Eldest was not the only one. The other Mystic Cave Saints also lashed out at Eleventh.

“I was wrong, I was wrong. I won’t dare joke about that again.”

Eleventh was able to tell that his older brothers were truly angry. Thus, he immediately apologized to them.

Although the Mystic Cave Saints were extremely loud inside the house, the seven disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect outside were unable to hear them because of the concealment formation.

“Hush!” Chu Feng suddenly spoke. He indicated to the Mystic Cave Saints to quiet down.

Hearing those words, the Mystic Cave Saints not only quieted down, but they also turned their gazes outward again.

It was only then that they discovered that the situation outside had become marvelous.
