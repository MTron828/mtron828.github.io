Chapter 2806 - Han Yu’s Challenge

“Hualong!!!”

Upon seeing Yuwen Hanyu, the people from Yuwen City immediately rushed toward him and began to heal his injuries.

As for the bystanders, they burst into an uproar. They were all whispering to one another and discussing the matter spiritedly.

Earlier, Yuwen Hualong had vowed to cripple Chu Feng’s cultivation.

However, what was the situation now?

How come his cultivation was crippled instead? Who was it who did it?

The crowd were still unable to confirm that it was Chu Feng who did it to Yuwen Hualong. After all, they felt that Chu Feng did not possess the strength to do so.

“Hualong, who crippled your cultivation?” The people from Yuwen City asked as they helped Yuwen Hualong heal his injuries.

“It’s Chu Feng, that animal. He’s despicable and shameless. He’s extremely cunning. He actually concealed his cultivation to plot against me.”

“His actual cultivation is simply not rank two True Immortal or rank three True Immortal. Rather, he’s a rank four True Immortal!!!”

The current Yuwen Hualong was in extremely weak health. However, when he voiced his grievance concerning Chu Feng, his voice was very resounding and powerful. It was as if every single word he said was like thunder exploding from his mouth.

Seeing him like that, the crowd were able to feel how enormous the hatred he held for Chu Feng was.

“It really was done by Chu Feng?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The crowd’s expression immediately changed upon hearing what Yuwen Hualong said. Then, they started to size up Chu Feng carefully.

Due to the fact that Chu Feng had not deliberately concealed his cultivation, the crowd were able to sense Chu Feng’s current cultivation.

“He really is a rank four True Immortal.”

“This Chu Feng, exactly how much is he hiding?”

Upon confirming Chu Feng’s cultivation, the crowd grew even more certain that Chu Feng possessed a grand origin. After all, Chu Feng had truly concealed himself extremely well.

That being said, they also felt a great amount of irony.

After all, Yuwen Hualong had declared that he would avenge Yuwen Tingyi. Yet, he ended up being crippled by Chu Feng. Furthermore, for the sake of finding Chu Feng, he had even used such a precious Clone Teleportation Formation.

How could he be considered to have been trying to cripple Chu Feng’s cultivation? He was simply rushing to his own death, rushing to destroying his own future.

“Chu Feng, you are truly daring. You actually have the nerve to cripple our Yuwen City’s two geniuses in succession. I will have you pay with your life for what you’ve done!!!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.

The next moment, several figures simultaneously leapt forth beside Yuwen Hualong.

It was those Yuwen City elders. They were simultaneously unleashing their attacks at Chu Feng with a very rapid speed.

The cultivation of those elders was not weak at all. They were all Heavenly Immortal-level experts.

Faced with experts this powerful, even though Chu Feng felt their killing intent, he was unable to escape at all.

At that moment, Chu Feng felt as if Yama, the King of Hell, had chosen him. At that moment, he was unable to escape from the impending doom.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

However, at practically the same moment those Yuwen City elders leapt forth to attack Chu Feng, a total of ten other people also soared into the sky. In the end, they landed firmly before Chu Feng.

After those ten people appeared before him, the killing intent and aura of death that Chu Feng felt disappeared into thin air.

Not only that, those ten individuals also unleashed their oppressive might at the same time. Although their oppressive might did not sweep forth, it created an invisible wall before them.

“Clank, clank, clank~~~”

When those Yuwen City elders collided with the wall of oppressive might, they reacted as if they had collided with an impenetrable wall. One by one, they started to grimace in pain. Their vision grew blurry, and their bodies swayed as they stepped back.

At this moment, Chu Feng was able to clearly see the ten individuals before him. Upon seeing who they were, Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He knew that he was safe now.

These ten individuals were all Heavenly Immortal-level experts. Furthermore, their overall strength greatly surpassed that of the Yuwen City elders.

As for these ten individuals, they were elders from the Sacred Pellet Villa and the Immortal Armament Villa.

“What are you all doing?”

“Aiyah.”

At this moment when a certain Yuwen City elder was about to react furiously, he suddenly opened his mouth and let out a scream.

It turned out that the collision earlier had been no small matter. He actually lost two of his front teeth.

“All of you, move aside. This matter is unrelated to you all.”

At this moment, the other Yuwen City elders began to speak out against them.

However, verbal criticism was all they dared to do. They did not dare to rashly attack those ten elders.

Actually, they were all helpless in the face of this crisis. That was the reason why they felt so unreconciled and displeased.

Although they were all Heavenly Immortal-level experts, the elders from the Sacred Pellet Villa and the Immortal Armament Villa possessed strength surpassing their own.

With those ten powerful elders standing before Chu Feng, they were simply an impregnable wall. Not to mention killing Chu Feng, they were simply unable to even injure Chu Feng.

“Unrelated to us? We have yet to even settle the debt of your Young City Master crippling our Sacred Pellet Villa’s disciple. Yet, you all dared to attack our Sacred Pellet Villa’s benefactor at a time like this. Did you think that we of the Sacred Pellet Villa were all dead?!” The Sacred Pellet Villa’s Elder Ma Changchun said. His voice was akin to thunder. It was extremely powerful and oppressive.

This Elder Ma Changchun was the strongest among the Sacred Pellet Villa’s elders present. His strength greatly surpassed that of these Yuwen City elders.

Moreover, he revealed his killing intent now. When he spoke, not only was his voice ear-piercing, it also caused the weather to change. It was as if even the heavens had become angry.

As he spoke, the oppressive might he emitted also swept forth. His oppressive might was extremely powerful. It shook the Yuwen City elders and forced them to back away repeatedly. One by one, they were sent rolling and crawling on the ground. Their appearances were truly sorry.

“You all are determined to make an enemy out of our Yuwen City?!” The Yuwen City elders asked.

At this moment, an elder from the Immortal Armament Villa spoke with a mocking tone. “So what if we are to become enemies with your Yuwen City? Could it be that our Immortal Armament Villa would possibly fear your Yuwen City?”

“You all...”

The people from the Yuwen City were about to explode with rage.

However, they were helpless to do anything. After all, their opponents were the Immortal Armament Villa and the Sacred Pellet Villa.

Not to mention these two powers joining hands, even if they were alone, their strength would still be superior to that of their Yuwen City.

Thus, at this moment, the Yuwen City elders were feeling extremely sullen.

“Chu Feng, while they can protect you for now, they will not be able to protect you forever. Our Yuwen City will definitely not let you get away with this. Just you wait.”

Helpless, the Yuwen City elders could only leave threats leveled at Chu Feng. Then, they turned around and returned to Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong’s side.

Pain and worry filled their faces.

Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi were both completely crippled. As for the two of them, they were their Yuwen City’s future successors. Yet, today, their cultivations had both been completely destroyed.

This was not a responsibility that they could shoulder. Thus, they would naturally be scared,

“Chu Feng, you have truly concealed your cultivation well,” Right at this moment, Han Yu cast an ill-intended gaze at Chu Feng. He said, “Since you’ve concealed your strength so well, I wonder, do you dare to fight against me, Han Yu?”

“What? Han Yu wants to fight against Chu Feng?”

Once Han Yu said those words, he immediately caused a huge ruckus.

The reason for that was because the crowd understood Han Yu very well. Precisely because of this, they felt that Han Yu’s challenge was clearly intended to bully Chu Feng.

Although Han Yu was a rank six True Immortal like Yuwen Hualong, the two of them were simply incomparable with one another.

The reason why Han Yu was able to obtain a ranking on the Demon-level Geniuses List was because he possessed the strength of a demon-level genius.

Han Yu was a Divine Body. Furthermore, his Divine Body was completely unsealed. If he was to utilize his Divine Power, he would be able to increase his cultivation by a single level much like Chu Feng after he used his Divine level Lightning Mark.

To put it simply, Han Yu absolutely could not be considered an ordinary rank six True Immortal. Rather, one should consider him a rank seven True Immortal.

The reason for that was because with how overwhelmingly talented Han Yu was, he would rarely find a match even among rank seven True Immortals.

Even if Chu Feng was able to defeat Yuwen Hualong, he absolutely would not be able to defeat Han Yu.
