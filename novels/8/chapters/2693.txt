Chapter 2693 - Demon Level

Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng hurriedly dodged to the side.

At the moment when Chu Feng was dodging, his aura was captured by his opponent.

“Rank one True Immortal?”

Sensing Chu Feng’s aura, that celestial fairy-like woman was evidently startled.

However, she soon streaked her hands across her Cosmos Sack. Then, two long swords appeared in her hands.

Those two swords were completely identical.

Their hilts were silver. The swords did not have any special decorations. However, they were shining brightly, and emitting very powerful auras.

These two swords were both Incomplete Immortal Armaments. Furthermore, they were both very high quality, and surpassed Chu Feng’s Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

“Woosh, woosh~~~”

With the two Incomplete Immortal Armaments in hand, the woman’s attacks grew even sharper. Although she did not move her feet, she thrust with the two swords in her hands repeatedly, and sent forth many sword rays that ripped the air apart. Those sword rays were shooting toward Chu Feng extremely quickly.

Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng hurriedly revealed his Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

However, his opponent’s attacks were simply too sharp and powerful.

Even though Chu Feng had increased his battle power by using the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler, he was still unable to dodge the attacks.

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng had no choice but to use the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler to block the incoming sword rays.

“Clank~~~”

“Clank~~~”

“Clank~~~”

......

Every time a sword ray collided with Chu Feng’s Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler, it would let out a loud metallic echo and dazzling sparks.

Most importantly, every time Chu Feng blocked a sword ray with his Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler, his arm would tremble violently.

After blocking repeatedly, Chu Feng felt his arm going numb.

“This girl, she’s very powerful.”

Chu Feng was endlessly astonished. Although he had determined this woman to be very strong when he first felt her aura, it was only when they actually fought that Chu Feng realized that she was stronger than he had imagined her to be.

It was most definitely not only because her Incomplete Immortal Armaments were better than his own that she was able to suppress him.

She herself also possessed extraordinary battle power. At the very least, if judging solely by her battle power, her battle power was most definitely not inferior to Chu Feng’s.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard.

At that moment, a surging sword aura started to rush toward Chu Feng like an enormous ocean wave. The aura was extremely imposing, and cut off Chu Feng’s escape.

This was an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.

This woman was extremely ruthless. She was planning to directly kill Chu Feng.

“Bang~~~”

Right at the moment when the surging sword aura was about to engulf Chu Feng, a golden-bright and dazzling light appeared from Chu Feng’s body. The golden light soon spread all around, engulfing their surroundings like bright sunshine.

The golden light actually managed to forcibly disperse the incoming sword aura.

At that moment, that woman finally stopped her attacks. A trace of shock emerged on her beautiful yet sharp eyes.

At that moment, an enormous golden sword with a length of several hundred meters was floating horizontally before Chu Feng. It was extremely imposing and domineering, like it was the ruler of that place.

Most importantly, once the sword appeared, Chu Feng’s battle power completely surpassed her own.

She was able to sense that Chu Feng’s battle power was now comparable to that of a rank two True Immortal.

All of this was because of that enormous golden sword.

“Who are you?” The woman asked.

She was very calm. Even though Chu Feng had unleashed his Ancient Era’s War Sword, there was no trace of fear in the young woman’s eyes.

“You tell me who you are first, and then I’ll tell you who I am,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, that woman suddenly smiled.

Her smile was truly charming. It was as if a lotus flower had bloomed on a vast region of ice that extended for ten thousand miles. It was an extremely beautiful sight, capable of charming anyone.

“You will not be able to know who I am.”

“However, I will definitely know who you are,” The woman said to Chu Feng with a smile.

Her smile was truly beautiful. That woman was most definitely someone who could cause the devastation of an entire state or country with her smile.

However, Chu Feng felt a deep sense of danger from her smile.

However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng was unafraid. Not only that, but he too smiled.

“I dare to guarantee that if you do not tell me who you are, you will definitely not be able to find out who I am,” Chu Feng said.

“Hard-mouthed,” said the woman. The sharpness in her eyes grew much more intense. Then, cyan-colored flames began to spread outward from her body.

Like a suit of armor, the cyan-colored flames covered her body.

Although they were clearly flames, they did not emit heat upon their appearance.

Instead, they were emitting a bone-piercing coldness. Soon, that chilly sensation filled the entire vast hall.

At that moment, even Chu Feng felt the cold to be slightly unbearable.

The reason for that was because that woman’s aura had increased to that of a rank two True Immortal.

“Young sis, to be honest, you’re quite remarkable,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

Although Chu Feng appeared to be completely calm, his heart was already in complete turmoil.

It was common knowledge that once one reached the True Immortal realm, regardless of whether it might be Divine Bodies or Inherited Bloodlines, all abilities that could increase one’s battle power would be restricted.

Only those with exceptional talent were capable of undoing the restrictions.

Thus, all those that were capable of undoing those restrictions were people superior to ordinary individuals. They were giants among men.

As for this woman, not only had she managed to undo the restriction of her Divine Power, but her Divine Power was also capable of allowing her to increase her cultivation by an entire level.

This sufficiently demonstrated just how powerful her Divine Power was.

However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng was still unafraid. After all, he was not an ordinary rank one True Immortal either. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“You dare continue to act this cheeky?”

The woman did not grow angry at Chu Feng’s teasing. Instead, a charming smile blossomed on her near-perfect face.

That said, at the same time that woman smiled, she unleashed her attack at Chu Feng.

This was merely an ordinary sword ray. However, it was many times stronger than the Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill from earlier.

However, faced with the incoming sword ray, Chu Feng did not even move. At that moment, nine-colored lightning started to flicker in his eyes.

“Zzzzz~~~”

The next moment, Chu Feng’s oppressive might swept forth. It forcibly dispersed the incoming sword ray.

“You...”

At that moment, the woman finally lost her calm. Not only were her eyes filled with astonishment, but even her previously completely composed and calm face had turned to one of deep shock.

She stopped her attack and started to size Chu Feng up. Her beautiful eyes were running over Chu Feng’s body nonstop. As for the main subject of her inspection, it was the character ‘Divine’ formed by the gathering of lightnings on Chu Feng’s forehead.

After sizing Chu Feng up, the woman smiled sweetly again.

She smiled very beautifully. It was as if all that had happened earlier was merely a misunderstanding.

She said, “So you’re actually someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Never would I expect that the Chu Heavenly Clan would actually hide a person like you. That Lightning Mark on your forehead is extremely extraordinary.”

“Could it be that you’ve trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?”

Chu Feng smiled lightly at the woman’s question. Then, he said, “Young sis, you’ve guessed wrong. I am not someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Not from the Chu Heavenly Clan?”

The woman’s eyebrows were slightly raised. She smiled meaningfully. Evidently, she did not believe Chu Feng.

That said, regardless of whether or not she believed him, Chu Feng was already charmed by that woman’s smiles.

Chu Feng discovered that that woman was truly peculiar.

When she didn’t smile, she was as cold as ice and frost. She resembled an ice-cold beauty where no one could reach her eyes.

However, when she did smile, she appeared extremely lovely and charming. It was as if she could lure one’s soul in with her smile.

If she was a celestial fairy untainted by anything when she didn’t smile, then she would be a demonic woman capable of seducing all living things when she did smile.
