Chapter 3672 - Three City Masters

As for the person standing on the right, it was a middle-aged man. That man had a very robust build, and was wearing golden armor. He resembled a war god, and appeared very imposing and majestic.

He was also an Utmost Exalted-level expert.

As for the person standing in the middle, he was simply too ordinary when compared to the two people beside him.

He was a somewhat messy-looking man. There was no spirit in his eyes. He had a shaggy beard, and wore simple clothes. In fact, he was even wearing straw sandals, and there was mud on his legs.

He looked like a farmer that had just come from the farm. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, standing there, no one dared to show any contempt towards him.

The woman was Monstrous Holy City’s City Master, Xian Yuying.

As for the man in golden armor, he was the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master, Kong Shanwu.

As for the person standing in the middle, he was Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master, Long Daozhi.

“Lord City Master!!!”

“Lady City Master!!!”

Seeing those three City Masters, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations reacted as if they had seen their saviors. Immediately, they got behind the three City Masters.

With grievance on their faces, they began to voice their complaints of what Beiyang Duchuan had done to them.

“Beiyang Duchuan, you’ve truly grown more and more outrageous. You actually dared to touch the people of our Three Cities?” Monstrous Holy City’s City Master Xian Yuyin asked with anger pulsing in her eyes.

“The way I see it, you don’t want to bring those younger generations of your All-heaven Sect back with you, right?”

Compared to the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master, the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master decided to strengthen his oppressive might as he spoke.

At that moment, Beiyang Duchuan’s complexion turned very ugly. As for Nangong Yifan and the other younger generations, pain was present on their faces.

“Misunderstanding. This is all a misunderstanding. How could I possibly bully the young? I was merely trying to scare that Chu Feng.”

Beiyang Duchuan, who was extremely aggressive earlier, actually had a terrified look on his face now.

“Misunderstanding?”

“I see that you feel that the people of our Ancestral Martial Starfield are all easy to bully, right?” asked the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“No, of course not. I wouldn’t possibly dare think that way. Our All-heaven Starfield has always had a friendly relationship with your Ancestral Martial Starfield. How could we possibly think that way?” explained Beiyang Duchuan.

“I will not make things difficult for you. Apologize to young master Chu Feng, and I will consider this matter dropped,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Young friend Chu Feng, earlier, this old man truly didn’t plan to do anything to you. It was merely a joke. Please don’t take offense to it, please don’t take offense.”

Without any hesitation, Beiyang Duchuan immediately started apologizing to Chu Feng.

It wasn’t that Beiyang Duchuan was a coward. It was simply that the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master’s gaze was simply soo fierce. Met with that gaze, even he felt great fear.

“That’s enough. Since you’ve come here, you’re a guest. Today, we’ll consider it as if you were really joking. However, you absolutely must not make this sort of joke again. Otherwise, our Three Cities will have to pay a visit to your All-heaven Sect,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“City Master Long, surely you jest,” Beiyang Duchuan smiled awkwardly.

“Enough with the superfluous words. Scram,” different from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master, the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master was much more direct, and actually cursed out Beiyang Duchuan.

Beiyang Duchuan’s expression turned very ugly. No matter what, he was a Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect. Yet, he was actually being insulted like that before his sect’s younger generations.

Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do. He had no choice but to lower his head in such a situation. No matter how displeased he might feel, he did not dare to erupt in anger.

Not only that, but he also had to be very respectful toward the three City Masters. After courteously bidding his farewell, Beiyang Duchuan turned around and prepared to leave.

“Wait,” however, when Beiyang Duchuan was preparing to leave with the All-heaven Sect’s younger generations, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master suddenly spoke.

Hearing that, Beiyang Duchuan trembled. When he turned around, the crowd could see that he was actually sweating cold sweat in fear.

“City Master Long, is there anything else you need?” Beiyang Duchuan’s voice was trembling with fear.

“You must also know what has been happening in our Ancestral Martial Starfield recently, right?”

“However, regardless of what might be happening, it remains an internal affair of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. I hope that the All-heaven Sect will not involve itself in this. Otherwise... we of the Three Cities will definitely not watch from the sidelines.”

The Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master had an extremely cold gaze as he said those words.

This frightened Beiyang Duchuan so much that he started to tremble slightly. He hurriedly replied, “Of course, of course.”

“Good. You can leave,” the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master said as he waved his hand.

Not daring to hesitate, Beiyang Duchuan hurriedly turned around and left with the All-heaven Sect’s younger generations.

When even Beiyang Duchuan was terrified by the scene earlier, the All-heaven Sect’s younger generations would naturally be even more terrified.

Thus, they were completely silent whilst leaving. Not a single person said anything. The atmosphere was very awkward.

It was only after they felt that they’d journeyed far enough that Nangong Yifan was finally unable to contain himself. He asked, “Lord Supreme Elder, they are merely the City Masters of the Three Cities. I’ve heard that they’re only rank one Utmost Exalted, like you.”

“Being of the same cultivation, why would you be so afraid of them? Your behavior is simply too much of a disgrace to our All-heaven Sect.”

“Nangong Yifan, watch your words. Wasn’t it because of your defeat to that Chu Feng that I ended up being disgraced? Did I not end up in that awkward situation because I was trying to stand up for you?” Beiyang Duchuan asked angrily. Although his voice was not loud and resounding, it was very ear-piercing.

Not only that, but his facial expression was also very terrifying. His eyes were blood-red giving him a fierce appearance. He seemed like he was about to eat someone.

Beiyang Duchuan was already brimming with anger after being suppressed by the Three Cities’ City Masters. For Nangong Yifan to ask such a criticizing question, he would naturally unleash all his suppressed anger onto Nangong Yifan.

Nangong Yifan was extremely tyrannical. He never paid any attention to the fellow younger generations of his All-heaven Sect.

However, he did not dare to act excessively impudent against the person before him. No matter what, Beiyang Duchuan was a Supreme Elder of their All-heaven Sect. Seeing that Beiyang Duchuan was enraged, Nangong Yifan did not dare say anything else.
