Chapter 2737 - Mother In Trouble

“I have not called seniors here today to make a decision on this matter. I merely wanted to discuss this.”

“The final decision would naturally have to wait till Lord Clan Chief exits his closed-door training so that he can decide things.”

“However, there is one thing that I needed to remind three seniors of.”

“Although the Law Enforcement Hall is one of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Four Halls, its status is above the other three halls.”

“When Lord Clan Chief is in closed-door training, the Law Enforcement Hall is to command the other three halls.”

“When the Law Enforcement Hall’s Hall Master is not present, the Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master is to command the other three halls.”

“Thus, I would like to ask instead, exactly who was being disrespectful earlier?” Chu Xuanzhengfa used his cold yet sharp gaze to look at the three Hall Masters.

“We have behaved badly. Zhengfa, please do not take it to heart.”

“That’s right. Zhengfa, we have no heart to offend you. After all, we’re your seniors.”

The three Hall Masters said.

“I addressed the three of you as seniors because I respect you all.”

“However, we are currently in the Four Halls Main Palace. In this place... I hope that three seniors will be able to act in accordance to the rules of our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Thus, you all should not be addressing me by name. Even though I am only a Vice Hall Master, as I am the Vice Hall Master of the Law Enforcement Hall, my position is still above yours,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

At that moment, the three Hall Masters revealed ugly expressions. However, after they took a glance at one another, they all bowed respectfully and said, “We were wrong to have offended you. We apologize to Lord Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master.”

“Forget about it. This matter shall be dropped today. However, I hope that three seniors will keep the order of things in mind.”

“If that Chu Feng is truly Chu Xuanyuan’s son, you all would have to have a plan in your hearts.”

“Furthermore, before Lord Clan Chief exits his closed-door training, I would like to not have anyone attack that Chu Feng.”

“Otherwise, do not blame me for being impolite,” Chu Xuanzhengfa’s eyebrows were narrowed. He looked to the three Hall Masters with a very sharp gaze.

“We wouldn’t dare, we wouldn’t dare.”

Regardless of how unwilling the three Hall Masters were, they did not dare to go against Chu Xuanzhengfa.

After all, Chu Xuanzhengfa’s cultivation had increased so quickly. At that moment he’d already surpassed them.

Furthermore, it was true that Chu Xuanzhengfa held a higher position than their own. Thus, there was nothing that they could do about him.

“You can go now,” Chu Xuanzhengfa waved his hand.

Then, the people from the World Spirit Hall, Military Hall and Treasure Hall all left.

At this moment, only the people from the Law Enforcement Hall remained in the vast meeting palace.

“Law Vice Hall Master, what you’ve done is truly a relief.”

“All these years, they have taken advantage of the fact that their seniority and cultivation surpassed your own, and have never placed you in their eyes.”

“From today on, we shall see which among them will dare to disrespect you again.”

At that moment, many people from the Law Enforcement Hall revealed joyous expressions.

They were all Chu Xuanzhengfa’s trusted aides. They also knew about the wrongs Chu Xuanzhengfa had suffered throughout the years.

However, the situation was different at present. Chu Xuanzhengfa’s cultivation had finally surpassed those three old codgers.

In a world where one’s strength determined one’s status, with the cultivation that Chu Xuanzhengfa currently possessed, he would be able to continuously suppress those three old codgers and make them unable to even lift their heads.

“I did not call them over here today to merely establish my might.”

“Most importantly, it is to give them a warning, to let them know that our Law Enforcement Hall is already paying attention to Chu Feng.”

“If any of them is to think about doing something noxious toward Chu Feng, they should first reconsider,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Lord Vice Hall Master is truly brilliant.”

“Merely... Lord Vice Hall Master, do you really think that Chu Feng is Lord Chu Xuanyuan’s son?” A member of the Law Enforcement Hall asked.

At that moment, the other members of the Law Enforcement Hall also revealed longing gazes. They were all longing for the answer.

“Before crucial moments come to pass, I also do not dare to be certain. However, I feel that he is most likely Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“If that Chu Feng is truly Lord Chu Xuanyuan’s son, it would truly be great.”

Upon hearing what Chu Xuanzhengfa said, the Law Enforcement Hall members present all revealed joyous expressions. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If he really is Chu Xuanyuan’s son, he will be in great danger. After all, Chu Xuanyuan has too many enemies.”

“As they are unable to take care of Chu Xuanyuan, they will shift their hatred towards his son,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“What should we do then?” At that moment, many people revealed worried expressions.

“That is why bringing Chu Feng back to our Chu Heavenly Clan would be the best option.”

“Merely, I’m afraid that it will not be that easy to accomplish,” Chu Xuanzhengfa sighed.

At that moment, the others grew silent. They all knew very well that it would indeed be very difficult to have Chu Feng return to their Chu Heavenly Clan.

The reason for that was because there were a lot of people who detested Chu Xuanyuan within the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Oh, that’s right. Where’s Lingxi? Why didn’t that girl come to bother me today?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Lord Vice Hall Master, Miss Lingxi has left for the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. She said... that when she returns, she will be a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. She also told us to inform Lord Vice Hall Master to prepare a gift for her return,” a member of the Law Enforcement Hall said.

“She left for the sake of making a breakthrough to become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist? That girl’s world spirit techniques have actually reached that level? That mischievous girl,” hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa’s lips rose into a smile.

......

Chu Feng had no idea what was happening outside. The reason for that was because after he left the Immortal Armament Villa with Song Xi, they immediately proceeded toward the Sacred Mountain.

The reason why they rushed back to the Sacred Mountain was because Chu Feng wanted to enter the Sacred Mountain to search for the whereabouts of Wang Qiang and the others.

After all, even if he needed to proceed for the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain, there was still enough time.

Since arriving there early would be pointless, Chu Feng did not wish to waste time.

Furthermore, the whereabouts of Wang Qiang and the others had always been an important matter that continued to linger in Chu Feng’s heart.

Of course, since Chu Feng and Song Xi had returned, they would naturally have to check on Song Xi’s mother first.

However, when Chu Feng and Song Xi returned to Song Xi’s home, they discovered that Song Xi’s home had already been razed to the ground.

Song Xi’s mother was gone. Only Aunt Jing was lying on the ground.

Not only was Aunt Jing covered with cuts and bruises, but she was also tied to a chain. That chain was connected to the ground and placed on Aunt Jing’s neck. Aunt Jing was tied up there like a dog.

“Aunt Jing, what happened here?”

“Aunt Jing, where’s my mother? Where’s my mother? Where has my mother gone to?”

Both Chu Feng and Song Xi were greatly startled. They both realized that the situation was bad.

Chu Feng was still relatively calm. However, Song Xi was completely panicking.

He arrived before Aunt Jing, tightly grabbed her shoulders and began to ask her about the whereabouts of his mother incessantly.

However, Aunt Jing seemed to be in some sort of shock, and was mentally confused. Not only did she not answer Song Xi’s questions, but she instead started to scream. It was as if she had gone insane.

Seeing this, Chu Feng pointed his finger forward. Immediately, a strand of spirit power entered Aunt Jing’s forehead.

When that spirit power entered Aunt Jing’s forehead, Aunt Jing instantly went motionless.

She only managed to return to normal after a long while passed. At the beginning, she had a blank expression. However, upon seeing Chu Feng and Song Xi, she immediately started crying.

“Young Master, you’ve finally returned. Something bad has happened! Madam, she, Madam, she, Madam has been captured,” Aunt Jing cried.

“My mother has been captured? Who? Who captured my mother?” Song Xi asked worriedly. He was utterly frantic.

“Was it done by the Zhao Mansion?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right, it’s the Zhao Mansion. The Zhao Mansion’s young master Zhao Zirong came to find Young Master for revenge.”

“Originally, because of the spirit formation set up by Lord Chu Feng, Zhao Zirong and the others were simply unable to charge their way in.”

“However, who would’ve thought that Zhao Zirong actually managed to request the assistance of the Grand Mountain Monastery’s headmaster.”

“The Grand Mountain Monastery’s headmaster was simply too powerful. Even the spirit formation Lord Chu Feng set up here was unable to stop him.”

“Not only did he break through Lord Chu Feng’s spirit formation, but he even captured Madam.”

“He said that if we wished to retrieve Madam, you all will have to go to the Grand Mountain Monastery. Otherwise... we can forget about seeing Madam again,” Aunt Jing cried.

“Damn it! Zhao Mansion, it’s them again! They actually dared to make troubles for me again!”

“I’m going to kill them! I’m going to kill them!” After hearing about what happened, Song Xi started to shout frantically and began to fly toward the Zhao Mansion.

As for Chu Feng, he would naturally not ignore this matter. He first helped Aunt Jing heal her injuries, and then comforted her.

After that, he chased after Song Xi. After he caught up to Song Xi, he increased his speed and, the two of them began to proceed for the Zhao Mansion together.

However, it seemed that the Zhao Mansion was prepared for their arrival. When they arrived at the Zhao Mansion, they discovered that the Zhao Mansion was completely deserted.

Through inquiring of the people in the city, Chu Feng and Song Xi came to find out that the people from the Zhao Mansion were afraid that Song Xi would bring Chu Feng for revenge. Thus, they had already scattered.

All of the workers had been driven out of the Zhao Mansion. As for the Zhao Mansion’s trusted aides, they were all moved into the Grand Mountain Monastery.

“What are we to do? What are we to do?!”

Seeing that all the people from the Zhao Mansion had left, Song Xi started to shout in worry.

He felt that while it was possible for Chu Feng to take care of the people from the Zhao Mansion, it would be extremely difficult for him to take care of the Grand Mountain Monastery.

No matter what, the Grand Mountain Monastery was the true overlord of the region. Furthermore, there were a lot of True Immortal-level experts in the Grand Mountain Monastery. As for their headmaster, he was an individual with an extremely powerful level of cultivation.

Song Xi felt that the Grand Mountain Monastery was simply an existence that they could not deal with. If they were to rashly proceed for the Grand Mountain Monastery, they would only be throwing their lives away.
