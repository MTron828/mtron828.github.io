Chapter 3349 - Request To Enter The Battle

The person who had appeared before the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform was an old lady.

That old lady possessed a very strong aura. She was a rank three Exalted. The reason why the crowd were so alarmed was not only because of her cultivation, but also because of the special identity that she possessed in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

She was the Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief.

The Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief was a close friend of Chu Feng’s grandfather, Chu Hanxian. In the past, the Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief had secretly helped Chu Feng, and even openly stood up for him.

She even went as far as to battle Chu Hanpeng.

Naturally, she was protecting Chu Feng because of Chu Hanxian.

Merely, no one had anticipated that she would arrive so quickly when Chu Feng encountered a calamity.

“Senior, as the Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master, I cannot allow you to take Chu Feng away.”

“However... as a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, as someone who possesses a conscience, and knows right from wrong, today, I, Chu Xuanzhengfa, earnestly ask senior to take Chu Feng away.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa actually knelt down to the Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief.

The Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief was very surprised by his action. Even she did not anticipate that he would do such a thing. It was as if her arrival to rescue Chu Feng was greatly helping Chu Xuanzhengfa.

While the Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief was still surprised, Chu Xuanzhengfa stood back up. He waved his sleeve, and a circular compass flew out from his hand.

The circular compass was black, and after it left his hand, it immediately started expanding.

At the same time as that was happening, a sort of special suction power emerged on the compass. That suction was targeted the lightning. After the compass landed on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, the Heavenly Lightnings that struck down repeatedly from the ninth heaven was all drawn to the compass.

“That’s the Blackgold Lightning Attraction Compass!!!”

Many people of the Chu Heavenly Clan revealed astonished expressions upon seeing the compass.

The Blackgold Lightning Attraction Compass was an item especially meant to block Heavenly Lightning.

However, it was only able to obstruct Heavenly Lightning for a very short moment. Nevertheless, even though it was only a short moment, a considerable amount of effort and treasures were needed to construct it. As such, the Blackgold Lightning Attraction Compass was a priceless treasure that could only be discovered, but not sought.

In the Chu Heavenly Clan, apart from their Lord Clan Chief, only Chu Hanpeng possessed a Blackgold Lightning Attraction Compass.

The Blackgold Lightning Attraction Compass that Chu Xuanzhengfa tossed out was handed to him by Chu Hanpeng. Chu Hanpeng had had Chu Xuanzhengfa look after Chu Feng. If Chu Feng was unable to resist the Heavenly Lightning, and was in fatal danger, he was to immediately use the compass and rescue him.

Thus, when the crowd saw the Blackgold Lightning Attraction Compass, they immediately understood everything.

At the moment when the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were astonished, Chu Xuanzhengfa’s body shifted, and he disappeared.

When he reappeared where he previously stood, he was carrying another person. As for that person, he was Chu Feng.

“Bang~~~”

At the moment when Chu Feng was rescued by Chu Xuanzhengfa, the Blackgold Lightning Attraction Compass shattered.

However, the Heavenly Lightning did not continue to strike down for much longer, before stopping altogether.

This was actually very normal. Without anyone on of the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, the Heavenly Lightning naturally would not strike.

Seeing the current Chu Feng, the crowd all felt very pained.

Chu Feng’s clothes were completely destroyed. Including his face, his entire body had been charred black by the lightning. Not a single inch of flesh could be seen. As for his aura, it was extremely weak.

“Allow me to treat him,” Chu Xuanzhengfa was originally planning to treat Chu Feng’s injuries, but the Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief interrupted him and began Chu Feng’s treatment on her own.

The Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief began to form hand seals single-handedly whilst placing her other hand on Chu Feng’s forehead. In the next moment, a blood-water like substance emerged from her palm and enveloped Chu Feng.

In merely a short moment, the blood-water started to dissipate. When the blood-water completely disappeared, Chu Feng had not only returned to how he looked previously, but he was also clothed, and his Cosmos Sack that had fallen onto the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform was also returned to his waist.

Merely, the current Chu Feng’s complexion was very pale. He looked seriously ill, and on the verge of death. He was still very weak.

“Senior Zhengfa, how is Lord Clan Chief’s... injury?” Chu Feng asked weakly.

“Lord Clan Chief has been poisoned with a very peculiar poison. However, you need not worry. We will think of a way to treat him.”

“The situation right now is very detrimental to you. We simply do not possess any evidence proving that it wasn’t you who poisoned Lord Clan Chief. Thus, Chu Feng... before we possess sufficient evidence, you should leave this place with the senior from the Blood Clan,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Okay,” Chu Feng nodded.

He also felt that it was meaningless for him to blindly stay in the clan, that it was better that he left in order to seek out the culprit.

“But, I need to go see Lord Clan Chief first,” Chu Feng added.

“Very well,” Chu Xuanzhengfa knew that Chu Feng was still very worried about the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Thus, he acceded to Chu Feng’s request.

Afterwards, the Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Xuanzhengfa, bringing Chu Feng together with them, began to fly toward the place where the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was being treated.

However, as they flew over, Chu Feng noticed the scene in the plaza.

“Senior, could it be that the match against the Fang Heavenly Clan has begun?” Chu Feng asked.

As Chu Feng was suffering from the immense torture of the Heavenly Lightning while he was on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, he had had no heart to concern himself with what was happening outside.

However, when he saw the plaza, he was able to guess what was happening.

“Indeed, the Fang Heavenly Clan has colluded with the Starfield Master Realm. They have come prepared. Our clan no longer has any hope of winning against them,” Chu Xuanzhengfa did not attempt to conceal the matter from Chu Feng.

“Senior, let me down,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, with how this Chu Heavenly Clan has treated you, you’re still trying to fight for them? Have you gone insane?” The Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief asked with a stern voice. It could be seen that she very much did not wish for Chu Feng to assist the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Senior, my father once told me this: ‘No matter when, we are still members of the Chu Heavenly Clan.’ While it is true that, today, there are clansmen that want to harm me... this is not the Chu Heavenly Clan’s fault, nor is it the Chu Heavenly Clan’s ancestor’s fault.”

“I will definitely not spare those people that wish to harm me. However, more than that, I cannot watch as outsiders snatch away the estate left behind by Old Ancestor,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, both Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief revealed a change in expression.

At that moment, the people below were all focused on the battlefield within the plaza. Thus, no one noticed that Chu Feng and the others were approaching.

At that moment, the Fang Heavenly Clan’s camps were still in their possession, whereas the Chu Heavenly Clan had lost fifty-nine of their camps.

Currently, a hundred and twenty-one banners were still standing.

However, only a single banner spelled ‘Chu Heavenly Clan.’ Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The match had reached the point where the outcome would be decided.

The Chu Heavenly Clan had gathered the strength of their entire clan to withstand the Fang Heavenly Clan’s offensive. They were unwilling to give up. They seemed to want to defend that final piece of dignity.

Thus, the originally boring match became slightly interesting.

Unfortunately, the Chu Heavenly Clan no longer possessed any momentum. After their previous struggles, all that remained were merely injured soldiers. It was simply impossible for them to withstand the Fang Heavenly Clan’s offensive.

Everyone knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan would not be able to last for long.

At that moment, the Fang Heavenly Clansmen all had complacent smiles on their faces.

As for the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan, regardless of age or gender, they were all very aggrieved.

This defeat would not only bring humiliation upon them, but it would also bring humiliation upon the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, a figure suddenly descended from the sky and landed at the entrance of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s camp.

Seeing that unexpected guest, everyone’s expressions changed.

However, before the crowd could say anything, that person clasped his fist respectfully at Wuming Fenghuo, who sat at the master seat of the plaza.

Loudly, he said, “Chu Heavenly Clansman Chu Feng requests to enter the battle!!!”
