Chapter 4312 - The Ninth Galaxy

Possessing an extremely powerful world spiritist bloodline. Being able to breach the barrier of the spirit worlds to enter them as a martial cultivator.

All of these signs pointed to Chu Feng’s mother.

While Chu Feng had never met his mother before, he had always believed his mother to be an extremely powerful existence.

After all, it was his mother that bestowned him such a powerful world spiritist bloodline.

To be able to inherit such a bloodline from his mother, Chu Feng knew that she was most definitely not someone ordinary.

Of course, that was merely Chu Feng’s guess.

At first, he was unable to be certain of anything.

But, when Xianhai Shaoyu mentioned that Jie Ranqing suddenly entered closed-door training tens of years ago, Chu Feng was no longer able to remain calm.

Why would a peak genius suddenly enter closed-door training for tens of years?

That was not something reasonable. It couldn’t possibly occur without reason.

But, if one was to say that she wasn’t in closed-door training but was instead imprisoned and was only announced as closed-door training, things would all make sense.

Chu Feng felt that Jie Ranqing was very possibly his mother.

This was not something that he determined only from the information he learned from Xianhai Shaoyu.

He also felt a sort of intuition that she was his mother. That intuition came from his bloodline.

At this moment, Chu Feng felt slightly distressed.

He learned that his mother was actually so dazzling. With how dazzling she was, she should be illuminating the entire martial cultivation world.

But, all due to his birth, she ended up being imprisoned. This made Chu Feng feel as if his heart was being sliced away.

“Brother Chu Feng, why... are you suddenly having this sort of expression?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked Chu Feng.

He was able to clearly see the change in Chu Feng’s expression.

It was a very complicated expression. There was shock and pain. Overall, it was difficult to describe that expression Chu Feng had. But, it seemed like he received some sort of major shock and was feeling very emotional.

This was the first time Xianhai Shaoyu saw such an expression on Chu Feng.

Even when he informed Chu Feng his bloodline was so powerful that it could go berserk, Chu Feng did not reveal this sort of expression.

Because of that, Xianhai Shaoyu was very confused. Why would Chu Feng become this emotional when he was only speaking about a senior?

“Brother Chu Feng, you couldn’t possibly know senior Jie Ranqing, right?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu all of a sudden.

“No, how could I know a senior of that caliber?” Chu Feng shook his head.

No matter how he determined Jie Ranqing to be his mother, it was merely his guess. Before verifying it, Chu Feng would not say that Jie Ranqing was his mother.

After all, if his guess was incorrect, it would be a certain laughingstock.

“Brother Shaoyu, have you heard whether or not senior Jie Ranqing has a man she’s fond of?” asked Chu Feng.

“A man she’s fond of?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“How could there possibly be anyone in this vast martial cultivation world that cough match her?”

“Let me say it like this. Jie Ranqing is someone that surpasses all others.”

“There might not exist any men that could match her in this world.”

“No matter who it might be, if anyone is to marry her, he will be a toad that managed to consume the meat of a swan.”

“I truly hoped that she would not marry any man. Only by that would she be more of a legend,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

Chu Feng wanted to scout out information regarding the relationship between his father and mother.

But, after hearing the way Xianhai Shaoyu responded, it was likely that all information had been sealed. People simply do not know about the existence of his father.

But, that was understandable. It was very reasonable for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to refuse something that they felt to be humiliating to be spread.

“Brother Shaoyu, in that case, what is the last galaxy?” asked Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, how did you know there’s another galaxy remaining?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

“I’ve heard that this vast martial cultivation world possesses nine galaxies.”

“Since the vast and boundless starry sky is separated into four different directional regions, there must be a central region too.”

“The four other directions can only exist in accordance to where the central region is.”

“Thus, the ninth galaxy must exist too,” said Chu Feng.

“You’re right. There are indeed nine galaxies.”

“Brother Chu Feng, look over there.”

As Xianhai Shaoyu spoke, he pointed his finger to the vast starry sky’s western direction.

Following Xianhai Shaoyu’s finger, Chu Feng looked over. What came into Chu Feng’s vision was darkness. But, within the darkness were countless stars flickering with faint lights.

Chu Feng knew that while those stars appeared very small, every one of them was a world.

The gathering of numerous stars forms a river of star, also known as a galaxy. The galaxies flow through the vast starry sky.

There existed nine galaxies in the vast martial cultivation world. But, some were located so far away that one simply cannot see them.

But, the galaxy Xianhai Shaoyu pointed toward was one that Chu Feng could see with his naked eyes.

Not to mention now, even when he was back in the Nine Provinces Continent and unable to cultivate, he would still be able to see that galaxy in the vast starry sky when he looked up at night.

“Brother Shaoyu, could it be that the galaxy we’re seeing is the ninth galaxy?” asked Chu Feng.

“Correct. That is the ninth galaxy. Brother Chu Feng, do you know why the other eight galaxies apart from the ninth galaxy are only able to see the ninth galaxy?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Is it because the other galaxies are located too far away?” asked Chu Feng.

“In terms of distance, the Nine Souls Galaxy is closest to your Holy Light Galaxy. But, are you able to see the Nine Souls Galaxy?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Why is it then?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s because the ninth galaxy is the brightest galaxy in the entire martial cultivation world.”

“At the same time, it is also the most mysterious galaxy. It is said that the secrets of the Immemorial Era are recorded there,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“The secrets of the Immemorial Era?” Chu Feng grew increasingly curious.

“That’s right. Because of that, the ninth galaxy is unruled. To be exact, even if it is ruled by someone, we have no idea who ruled it.”

“Since the Ancient Era, there have been countless experts that entered that galaxy.”

“But, without exception, none of them returned from the galaxy.”

“There are people that proclaimed that place to be the Domain of Gods. Those that entered that place are all unwilling to leave because of how beautiful and fine that galaxy is.”

“But, there are also people that proclaimed that place to be the purgatory. Those that entered it all lost their lives inside. As they’re already, it was natural that they wouldn’t return.”

“But, the great majority of the people were more willing to believe it to be the Domain of Gods.”

“Because of that, the ninth galaxy is known as the Immemorial Domain of Gods.”

“Of course, there are also people that addressed it as the Immemorial Purgatory,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

Hearing the explanation from Xianhai Shaoyu, Chu Feng looked to the ninth galaxy again.

He had always felt that there were people more powerful than him in this vast martial cultivation world.

But, after Xianhai Shaoyu informed him of the structure of the vast martial cultivation world, Chu Feng felt that while he still hadn’t reached the summit of the martial cultivation path, he was at least able to see it.

Seeing the ninth galaxy, Chu Feng saw unfathomable depths.

If the ninth galaxy really recorded the secrets of the Immemorial Era, it most definitely also recorded the secrets of the Ancient Era.

But, why would it be that the people that entered the ninth galaxy never returned?

Even if that place was truly a sacred cultivation ground, people should still desire to return to announce their safety to their family and loved ones.

But, Chu Feng felt that the ninth galaxy was not a place of certain death. Such a bright galaxy illuminated the entire boundless martial cultivation world. How could such a place be the purgatory?

While Chu Feng had only learned about this ninth galaxy, the mysteriousness of the ninth galaxy had already invoked Chu Feng’s interest.

“Brother Shaoyu, could one enter the ninth galaxy at will?” asked Chu Feng.

“Enter it at will? How could that be possible?”

“It’s very difficult to enter the ninth galaxy,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.
