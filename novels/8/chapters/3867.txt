Chapter 3867 - Terrifying Impact

The next moment, something even stranger occurred.

At the same time, the eleven Mystic Cave Saints pulled out their hands from their dantians.

Once their hands were pulled out, their damaged dantians immediately restored themselves.

They were still completely unharmed. Furthermore, an item had appeared in their hands.

It was a stone-like object.

They were fragments. Chu Feng was able to tell that the fragments were most likely some sort of treasure that had been shattered into eleven pieces.

If the fragments were fused back together, the treasure would be restored.

“These guys, they’ve actually hidden treasures in their dantian?”

Chu Feng felt extremely astonished.

Although he had no idea how the Mystic Cave Saints had accomplished such a thing, it really did appear that they had used their dantians as Cosmos Sacks.

To be able to store treasures and be opened at any time without causing any damage to oneself or one’s cultivation, Chu Feng finally realized why the Mystic Cave Saints were so poor, why their Cosmos Sacks that he took in the World Spirit Mansion Gate held no treasure at all.

It turned out that they had placed all their treasures in their dantians.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints formed hand seals single-handedly, and then tossed forth the fragment in his hand.

Following him, the remaining ten Mystic Cave Saints did the same thing.

Soon, the fragments gathered together and turned into a strange creature.

That creature seemed like a fat, white dog. However, that dog-like creature had an enormous pig-like nose.

Merely, that nose was many times larger than an ordinary pig’s nose.

That creature seemed to be alive. Furthermore, it did not appear to have been created artificially.

However, it stood there completely motionless, like a sculpture. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Furthermore, Chu Feng was unable to sense its aura. It was like it did not exist at all.

In short, this thing was rather strange too.

“The eleven of you are simply too careful, no? You’ve actually hidden your treasures in your dantians?”

“That said, how did you accomplish such a strange feat?”

Compared to the enormous pig-nosed dog-like creature, Chu Feng was more interested in how the Mystic Cave Saints were able to keep their treasures in their dantians.

“Hehe. Brother Asura, that is the gift that we brothers possess. You’d best not attempt to imitate us, since you wouldn’t be able to do so.”

“Right, right, right. You must not attempt to imitate us. If you do, you’ll end up ruining your cultivation.”

The Mystic Cave Saints spoke with smiles on their faces. They appeared very proud as they spoke.

“In that case, what use is this thing?” Chu Feng pointed to the unusual creature.

“This thing is called the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast. It can be considered to be a treasure.”

“Through its sense of smell, it is able to detect some dangerous things.”

“However, it can only be used once. Unless absolutely necessary, we brothers would not use it.”

“However, as matters stand, we seem to have no choice but to use it. We will have to rely on it to guide our path,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“In that case, you can begin,” said Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, release a strand of your spirit power and bind it with the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast. Once it begins to smell danger, you will be able to sense what it senses, and determine the true appearance of this place,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Very well.” Chu Feng did not hesitate, and did as he said.

“Huu, huu, huu~~~”

After Chu Feng released his spirit power and bonded with the so-called Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast, Chu Feng noticed that it began trembling slightly, but did not show any sign of special change.

However, all of a sudden, Chu Feng’s sense of smell became extremely sharp.

His sense of smell connected with his other senses, his perception, and even his soul.

Following that, an intense reek of blood and killing intent rapidly rushed into Chu Feng from either side of the cave, impacting him nonstop.

“No more, no more. It’s too terrifying.”

“I cannot continue sensing anymore. Otherwise, my soul will not be able to withstand it.”

Soon, the others from the Mystic Cave Saints began to cut off the connection of their spirit power with the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast.

As the intense reek of blood and killing intent bombarded them, they were completely enveloped by the aura of terror. As for that aura of terror, it was capable of causing harm to their souls.

The Mystic Cave Saints were only connected to the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast for a short moment. Yet, they were already terrified to a state of shivering.

If they had continued, they would’ve been impacted even more by that terrifying aura. It would even be possible for them to be completely terrified to death.

With the situation being like that, even the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints had quickly severed his connection with the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast.

“Big brother, brother Asura is still sensing! We must quickly sever their connection!”

Seeing that Chu Feng’s spirit power was still connected to the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast, Eleventh spoke and released his spirit power. He turned his spirit power into a sharp blade and wanted to sever the connection between Chu Feng and the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast.

“Wait.”

Right at that moment, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints rushed to stop Eleventh.

“Big brother, that aura is simply too strong. That thing will strengthen brother Asura’s senses. If this is to continue, brother Asura might end up dying from the impact of that terrifying aura. Even if he’s able to live, his consciousness will be damaged, and he will go insane,” Eleventh said with great worry.

“Fool! Look carefully, is brother Asura showing symptoms of fear?” the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints said as he pointed to Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, the others from the Mystic Cave Saints began to carefully examine him.

Upon doing so, shock filled their eyes.

They had only connected to the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast’s enhanced senses for a short period of time. Yet, they were terrified to a state of shivering, drenched in cold sweat, and unable to calm down.

As for Chu Feng, he had remained connected for so long, yet his body was still extremely tranquil. He was showing no signs of being affected.

“Did brother Asura release his spirit power incorrectly? Could he have failed to connect with the Cosmos Giant-nosed Beast?” asked Eleventh.

“Bullshit! Do you think brother Asura is as clumsy as you?” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints with contempt.

“But that aura was so terrifying. Why is brother Asura unaffected?” asked Eleventh.

“This shows how strong his spirit power is. His spirit power is able to withstand the impact of that terrifying aura,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Ah? For real?”

“If that’s really the case... it’ll be simply too crazily abnormal!”

Hearing their eldest brothers’ words, the Mystic Cave Saints’ eyes were all filled with intense shock.
