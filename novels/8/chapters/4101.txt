Chapter 4101 - Arrival Of The Backer

In a panic, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master shouted, “Exactly what are you planning to do?!”

Even though his voice was very powerful, it no longer possessed the arrogance from before.

The current Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master was completely lacking in confidence.

After all, it was not just the lives of everyone from the Purple Star Hall; even his own life was in Long Daozhi’s hands.

Long Daozhi did not bother to pay attention to the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng. “Chu Feng, take out your Star-guiding Stones.”

Chu Feng did not hesitate, and took out both Star-guiding Stones and handed them to Long Daozhi.

After receiving the two Star-guiding Stones, Long Daozhi tossed them over to the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

“Honor your promise,” ordered Long Daozhi.

The Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master realized what Long Daozhi intended to do.

He was demanding his rank three Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

The Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master took out the rank three Exalted Taboo Martial Skill again.

However, he was trembling with fear as he handed it to Long Daozhi.

A look of unease was also present in his eyes. It was as if he was worrying about something.

After Long Daozhi received the rank three Exalted Taboo, he directly opened the scroll.

Upon seeing the contents of the scroll, he let out a sneer before turning to look at the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

“No matter what, you’re the overlord of a Lower Starfield. Do you not find yourself disgraceful by doing this?”

Long Daozhi’s tone was extremely insulting.

However, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master did not refute him, and instead lowered his head silently. It was as if he were quietly accepting the insults.

The others present were all confused upon seeing this.

They did not understand why Long Daozhi insulted the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

“Everyone, have a look.”

“See for yourselves how despicable and vile of a person this Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master is.”

Seemingly knowing that the crowd were confused, Long Daozhi tossed the scroll into the sky.

The scroll opened downward. Although the words written on it were extremely small, the cultivators present were all able to see them clearly.

Seeing the scroll, the people from the younger generation were bewildered. They were unable to determine what the issue was.

However, those from the older generation were completely shocked.

They managed to tell that the rank three Exalted Taboo Martial Skill was actually a fake.

It turned out that even if the cultivation treasure didn’t appear, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master wasn’t planning to uphold his promise.

From the very start, he had never intended to bestow a rank three Exalted Taboo Martial Skill to the people from the Abandoned Starfields.

The rank three Exalted Taboo he had prepared was a phoney.

Most infuriating of all, even if the Ten Abandoned Starfields were to discover that the rank three Exalted Taboo was a fake, none of them would dare to say anything out of fear for the Purple Star Hall. They would have no choice but to accept their losses and pent up their unspoken grievances.

Fortunately, Long Daozhi had appeared.

If it wasn’t for him, no one would know that the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master was actually this despicable.

It was no wonder that Long Daozhi would insult him.

His behavior was indeed deserving to be insulted, and even beaten.

“It’s not that I do not wish to give a rank three Exalted Taboo.”

“It’s simply that our Purple Star Hall only has a single rank three Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.”

“That is our rank three Exalted Taboo: Purple Meteor Shower.”

“But, Purple Meteor Shower is our Purple Star Hall’s hall protection treasure. Our great forefather established a rule that we cannot divulge it to outsiders.”

“Furthermore, one must train in our Purple Star Hall’s Purple Star Martial Technique in order to learn the Purple Meteor Shower. Else, even if one is to learn it, it would be useless.”

Seeing that his scheme had been exposed, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master told the truth.

“Since that’s the case, then hand over that Purple Meteor Shower,” said Long Daozhi.

“I’ve already said that it is our Purple Star Hall’s hall protection treasure left behind by our great forefather, and cannot be divulged to outsiders. Besides, even if Chu Feng is able to obtain it from me, it would be useless for him. If he is to forcibly attempt to train it, he will only end up losing control over himself,” the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master emphasized.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

However, right after his words left his mouth, the screams from the people of the Purple Star Hall grew even more miserable. There were even people that exploded and died. Even the Utmost Exalted-level experts were bleeding from all of their facial orifices, and on the verge of collapse.

That was naturally caused by Long Daozhi.

“I will not force you. You can choose whether to comply with the rules of your Purple Star Hall’s forefathers, or allow your Purple Star Hall to be wiped out.”

Long Daozhi looked to the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master as he tortured the people from the Purple Star Hall.

“I’ll give, I’ll give.”

Helpless, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master had no choice but to reach terms.

Then, he personally took out their Purple Star Hall’s hall protection martial skill, the rank three Exalted Taboo: Purple Meteor Shower.

After Long Daozhi confirmed the validity of the rank three Exalted Taboo, he handed it to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng did not hesitate, and directly accepted the rank three Exalted Taboo.

As matters stood, he had already had a complete falling-out with the Purple Star Hall. In fact, if it wasn’t for Long Daozhi’s appearance today, him and his Chu Heavenly Clan might have all died here.

Because of that, Chu Feng no longer had any misgivings.

That said, even with all this, Long Daozhi was still not planning to spare the people from the Purple Star Hall.

Even though he stopped torturing them, he began to insult them.

He had the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master lead all the people from the Purple Star Hall to kneel before Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

To the Purple Star Hall, this was an act of extraordinary shame and humiliation.

Yet, none of them dared to refuse.

They were already utterly humiliated today. Thus, as long as they were able to live, they were willing to do anything. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Seeing all the elders and disciples of the Purple Star Hall, tens of millions of people, all uniformly kneeling to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, the people from the Purple Star Upper Realm and other starfields were all gasping in disbelief.

Before this banquet, simply no one would’ve imagined that a colossus like the Purple Star Hall would submit to a mere Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, after all of this happened before them, the crowd had no choice but to accept it.

The Ancestral Martial Starfield was completely different from before. An overwhelming change had occurred with them.

The Ancestral Martial Starfield that was deemed to be the weakest starfield in the entire Holy Light Galaxy was definitely going to emerge in power and have all the powers in the Holy Light Galaxy take note of them.

That said, the crowd knew that it was not only Long Daozhi that had led to the transformation of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

The most important person was the unprecedented genius Chu Feng.

“Hahaha...”

Suddenly, a burst of strange laughter exploded in the sky above.

As the laughter echoed, heaven and earth started to change.

This made everyone realize that the owner of that laughter was extraordinary.

“Hall Master Li, aren’t you too much of a disgrace?”

“How could you actually bow down to a bunch of trash from an Abandoned Starfield?”

Then, an old man appeared before the crowd.

This old man was standing in the sky above the clouds.

Over ten thousand meters up in the air, his human-sized body appeared extremely small.

However, it just so happened that this old man was emitting an extremely powerful air. Even though he was small-statured, he was looking down with a posture of overlooking mortals like a ruler.

It was as if this entire place was under his control.

Furthermore, the title plate on his waist caused many people to change their expressions.

On the title plate were the words ‘Seven Stars Alliance.’

“Lord Lei Tong, save me!”

The Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master not only stood up, but he also begged for help.

‘Crap!’

Chu Feng shouted ‘oh no’ in his heart.

He had no idea who this old man from the Seven Stars Alliance was.

But, through the conversations of the crowd, he learned of what sort of existence the Seven Stars Alliance was.

The Seven Stars Alliance was the overlord of a Middle Starfield.

They were a power far superior to the Purple Star Hall.

As for that old man, he was named Lei Tong, and was one of the Seven Stars Alliance’s Supreme Elders.

Most importantly, the Purple Star Hall was one of the Seven Stars Alliance’s subsidiary powers.

In simpler terms, the Seven Stars Alliance was the Purple Star Hall’s backing!
