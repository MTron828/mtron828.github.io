Chapter 5332: Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Invasion

While Chu Feng also had the Totem Dragon Clan’s strongest token in his possession, he knew that it wouldn’t be of any help to his current situation. 

Yuan Jiang was clearly not just a Half-God level cultivator, and he was staking his all on this matter. Needless to say, he wouldn’t give up here just because the Totem Dragon Clan told him to. In other words, the Totem Dragon Clan wouldn’t be able to save him.

His only hope was his father’s protection formation.

“Eggy, trust me… I won’t die… Nothing will happen to me… If anything… endangers my life… the protection formation… will ensure my safety,” Chu Feng emphasized.

“All right,” Eggy replied despite her unease.

Weng!

The ancient compass Zhou Dong had been channeling released a burst of light that shot into the sky. This burst of light resembled a single thread, but it contained immense spirit power. 

“How did he do that?” 

The Ancient Realm’s chief and elders looked at the thread of spirit power in disbelief. They could tell that Zhou Dong was planning to open a spirit formation gate that allowed outsiders into the Ancient Realm… but this was a feat that none of them were capable of. 

How did Yuan Jiang grasp such means? Could he possibly know of secrets that they were unaware of?

Yuan Jiang smirked when he saw how shocked those from the Ancient Realm were. He turned to them and said, “I already told you earlier that I have my basis for my guesses. Witness the future, my foolish brethren!”

The crowd from the Ancient Realm didn’t know what to say. Yuan Jiang had indeed pulled off something they were incapable of.

At the same time, the crowd outside the Ancient Realm was also gripped by shock. The spirit power that gushed from the earth into the sky was visible even from outside the Ancient Realm. 

“What’s that?”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Putting aside the others, even Xia Xingchen from the Heavenly Domain Immortal Sect was bewildered too.

“It’s a spirit formation gate,” Gongsun Wentian replied.

“Spirit formation gate? Why would a spirit formation gate suddenly appear here? Does it lead into the Ancient Realm?” Xia Xingchen asked.

She could also tell that it was a spirit formation gate, but the problem was that the gate carried the Ancient Realm’s aura. Why would the Ancient Realm suddenly open such a huge spirit formation gate? This was something that had never happened before.

All of a sudden, Xia Xingchen turned her gaze toward the Bluemoon Sacred Palace. The gray aura that covered half of the sky had started to recede. Slowly, the full force of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace was being revealed. 

The crowd below also noticed it and raised their heads. Their faces immediately paled in nervousness.

The armored army of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace, together with their monstrous beasts and mounts, was standing in a neat formation in the sky. They numbered in the hundreds of millions. In particular, the eight thousand people positioned at the forefront of the army emanated strong auras. These people were channeling their powers on a single warship to activate a formation.

Astonishingly, this formation shared the same aura as the Ancient Realm.

“Why does that formation have the aura of the Ancient Realm? What are they planning?” Xia Xingchen frowned.

A man suddenly stepped out from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s warship. Every member of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace immediately kneeled down to pay respect to him.

This man stood at a height of three meters. He was dressed in majestic armor and a black cape, which swayed along with his elegant blue hair. His presence stirred the flow of energy, exerting tremendous pressure on the surroundings.

Gongsun Wentian’s complexion turned grave upon seeing the man. 

The crowd below also paled in horror. Even the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s Mo Wuxiang clenched his fists out of nervousness. 

“The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master! He’s actually here?”

Gongsun Wentian rose to his feet and rushed outside. Xia Xingchen and the top experts of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect hurriedly followed suit and stood in a neat formation behind him. 

“Calm down, Gongsun Wentian. My goal is the Ancient Realm. As long as you don’t interfere in our affairs here, I’ll guarantee the safety of your juniors.” The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master didn’t even glance at Gongsun Wentian when he said those words.

“Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master, I hope that you’ll keep your promise,” Gongsun Wentian said.

“Rest assured. I am a man of my word,” the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master replied. “The junior of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect will also make it out alive.”

“My deepest gratitude.” 

Mo Wuxiang bowed in response, but not a single person thought that he was embarrassing himself. After all, the other party was the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master! Other than Gongsun Wentian, none of the people present here could pose a match to him. 

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master had shown plenty of respect to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect by addressing Mo Wuxiang’s concern. It was only right for Mo Wuxiang to thank the other party.

“What is your goal? Are you attacking the Ancient Realm to steal their fortune?” Xia Xingchen asked.

“That is none of your business. I have already guaranteed the safety of your junior. You may leave now. Remember this. If you dare to get in the way of my plans…” A faint smile formed on the lips of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master as he said those words. 

The crowd felt chills running down their spine. That smile was more than enough to relay his threat. 

Some of the more cowardly ones began to leave the area. They sensed that something huge was about to happen, and they didn’t want to get involved in it. 

More and more people joined them. Most people were aware that this wasn’t a commotion they could afford to watch, but they were hesitant to make the first move out of fear that it might be a trap. They only made their move upon confirming that those before them had made it out alive. 

In just a few moments, the only ones left in this crowded place were the Bluemoon Sacred Palace, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. In fact, if not for this realm being sealed off, the crowd would have already escaped from this realm. 

The appearance of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master made it clear that something huge was going to happen, and it likely didn’t bode well. 

Boom!

The formation in the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s warship suddenly released a huge burst of energy toward the spirit power that was gushing out from the Ancient Realm.

Boom boom!

The flow of energy was so great that the sky and the earth quivered before it. Clouds began forming out of spirit power, forming a phenomenon. Slowly, the long thread that extended from the earth to the sky began to open, forming a humongous spirit formation gate.

“Bluemoon Sacred Palace, follow me into the Ancient Realm!”

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master began charging toward the spirit formation gate with his warship, and his hundreds of millions of troops followed closely behind him.

Xia Xingchen wanted to make a move and investigate the situation too, but… 

Pah!

A person held her down before she could make a move. It was Gongsun Wentian.

“Don’t interfere in this matter,” Gongsun Wentian said.

“But…” Xia Xingchen tried to protest.

“I am still wounded. I don’t have the confidence to defeat the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master,” Gongsun Wentian replied.

It finally dawned on Xia Xingchen how grave the situation was. She had heard rumors about the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master’s personality. What the other party mentioned earlier was unlikely to be just empty threats.  

She was hoping to stop the Bluemoon Sacred Palace from massacring the people of the Ancient Realm, but if even Gongsun Wentian wasn’t confident of defeating the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master, it would be reckless of her to get involved here. 

She couldn’t possibly endanger the lives of her brethren from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect just because of her own sense of justice.

Meanwhile, the crowd inside the Ancient Realm was utterly bewildered by the massive army of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace charging in with huge warships and monstrous beasts. 

It immediately became apparent to them that this was an invasion!

“Yuan Jiang, you really betrayed our Ancient Realm! You deserved to die thousand times over!” 

Infuriated, the Ancient Realm’s chief rose to his feet to confront Yuan Jiang. He knew that he was outmatched here, but he wanted to punish the latter by any means possible.

Uwa!

Barely as the Ancient Realm’s chief got to his feet, he suddenly fell to the ground once more. A sharp sword had pinned him down to the ground. 

“Don’t move if you don’t want to die,” a voice echoed from the sky.

The one who had made a move this time around wasn’t Yuan Jiang but the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master.

“Dong’er.” 

After suppressing the Ancient Realm’s chief, the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master turned to Zhou Dong.

Zhou Dong, with his severely injured body, rose to the sky and headed to the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master’s side.

“Lord Father, we succeeded,” Zhou Dong said with a gleeful smile.

“You’ve worked hard, Dong’er. Who hurt you?” the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master asked.

“It’s that fellow.” Zhou Dong pointed at Chu Feng.

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master cast his gaze over. His first instinct was to kill the person who had injured Zhou Dong, but when he saw Chu Feng’s pathetic state, he knew right away that it wasn’t time for him to make a move yet. 

Thus, the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master turned to Yuan Jiang and asked, “What are you doing?”

“The energy of our Ancient Realm’s Ancestral Idol currently resides in this child. I’m trying to weaken the Ancestral Idol so that I can take control of it. Once I do that, I’ll be able to freely open the vault containing the Sacred Temple Beads,” Yuan Jiang replied.

“That lad seems to be at his limit,” the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master glanced at Chu Feng and remarked.

“His death doesn’t pose a problem, though I must say, he is surprisingly resilient,” Yuan Jiang mocked.

Chu Feng had already fainted by this point. He was barely hanging on.

Weng!

Teleportation energy suddenly enveloped the white-haired woman.

Shoosh!

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master released a burst of grayish-black aura to seal off the huge spirit formation gate that extended from the earth to the sky. He could tell that someone was trying to save the white-haired woman, and he was determined to stop it. 

Grar!

Golden dragons suddenly appeared in the sky with majestic roars.

“Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master, I don’t care what you’re planning to do to the Ancient Realm, but know that our Totem Dragon Clan will not let you off if you dare to hurt her,” a woman’s voice echoed from the spirit formation gate.

It was the white-haired woman’s aunt.
