MGA: Chapter 1521 - A Martial Emperor’s Might Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chu Feng left, following Dugu Xingfeng and the others.

At this moment, only Yan Lei, Yan Ru and the others remained.

They stood there gazing in the direction which Chu Feng had left in. They were unable to calm themselves.

However, right at this moment, many figures suddenly appeared from all directions. There were men, women, old, young, Martial Kings and Half Martial Emperors. They covered all the directions and both the sky and the ground.

Furthermore, at this moment, they were all discussing spiritedly. This quiet place had instantly became a cacophony.

Yan Lei and the others were not surprised by what was happening. Although this garden, this venue for their younger generation’s gathering, was a place that people rarely visited, the battle between Chu Feng and Xian Kun earlier had created an enormous commotion.

With how ferocious that battle was, it would instead be strange if the experts of the Yan Clan did not come over.

However, upon seeing that it was a battle between two members of the younger generations that possessed extraordinary origins, they decided not to interfere with the fight. In fact, none among them even bothered to show themselves. They had decided to completely ignore the battle.

It was only when this matter was over that they showed themselves and began to discuss what had happened.

“Big brother Chu Feng and the others have gone to pay a visit to our Ancestor. For there to be so many people coming at once, they must have something important to discuss. I wish to go over there and see,” Yan Ru said to Yan Lei.

Yan Lei did not answer Yan Ru. Instead, he turned to ask Yan Xie, “Lil Bro Yan Xie, is it suitable for us to meet Ancestor right now?”

The Yan Clan’s Ancestor was someone who was in closed-door training all year round. Other than the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief, unless there was a very important matter, no one could meet him and no one must disturb him. Even the people from the Yan Clan were not allowed to do so.

As for Yan Xie, he was the person with the best relationship with the Yan Clan’s Ancestor. Yan Xie knew the Yan Clan’s Ancestor’s temperament the best. He was also the only one who could disturb the Yan Clan’s Ancestor at any moment.

“You can follow me,” Yan Xie said. In fact, he also wished to go over and see exactly what was happening. It was not because he was curious as to what Dugu Xingfeng and the others wished to find their Yan Clan’s Ancestor for. Rather, he was purely interested in Chu Feng.

Yan Xie was someone who stayed in the Yan Clan to train all the time. Very rarely did he ever go out. Even though there were frequently disciples from hidden experts who would come to pay their respects to their Yan Clan, they were not people who could match up to Yan Xie at all.

Thus, Yan Xie did not bother to pay attention to those people at all. However, Chu Feng was different. Chu Feng was the first person among Yan Xie’s generation who had managed to catch Yan Xie’s attention. This caused Yan Xie’s undisturbed heart to suddenly become restless.

Suddenly, three figures flew over from the crowd and asked, “Lil Bro Yan Xie, can you bring us with you?”

They were two males and a female. The female was very young and pretty. She was also wearing a very enchanting dress. Overall, she appeared to be very charming.

However, she was already over a hundred years old and possessed the cultivation of a rank three Half Martial Emperor.

As for those two men, they had the appearances of middle-aged men. However, their actual ages were much older than that female’s. One was over three hundred years old, and the other was over six hundred years old. The two of them were old, elderly men.

However, not only were their ages older than the woman’s, their cultivations were also much stronger than hers as well. The three hundred-plus-year-old man was a rank five Half Martial Emperor. As for the six hundred-plus-year-old man, he was a rank seven Half Martial Emperor. His cultivation was the same as Half Martial Emperor White Ape’s.

“Third brother, Fifth brother, Ninth sister, you all actually have the time to bother with this sort of thing?” Yan Ru walked over and asked with a beaming smile.

It turned out that these three people were Yan Ru’s blood siblings. Like her and Yan Lei, the three of them were all the children of the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief.

“What’s wrong, only you, girl, are allowed to enjoy this liveliness, and your ninth sister is not allowed to do the same?” That ninth sister’s eyes narrowed as she displayed an enchanting smile.

However, her smile was completely different from Yan Ru’s naive and innocent smile. While it appeared to be very charming, it was actually very shrewd and ruthless.

After all, she was someone who had lived for over a hundred years. Even though she had managed to maintain her appearance through special methods, she was unable to maintain a pure mindset the entire time.

“Ninth sister, that won’t do. Today is a gathering of the younger generation. You all cannot be considered to be from the younger generation. Thus, you cannot participate,” Yan Ru said with a mischievous smile.

“Ru’er, stop playing around,” The third brother pushed Yan Ru aside and walked over to Yan Xie. He said, “Lil Bro Yan Xie, bring us over to the Ancestor too. It’s been a very long time since we last saw him too. We also wish to pay our respects to him.”

Even though this third brother was a true elder brother-level character among the Yan siblings, he was very courteous toward Yan Xie. In fact, there was even a trace of reverence in his tone.

In fact, very few people in the entire Yan Clan would not revere Yan Xie. As for the reason why, it was none other than because the person standing behind Yan Xie was their Yan Clan’s Ancestor.

“We’re siblings. There’s no need to be so polite. Come, you all can follow me,” As Yan Xie spoke, he began to walk into the sky and toward the direction that Chu Feng and the others had left in. Although his footsteps were not rushed, his speed was extremely fast. Seeing that, Yan Ru and the other siblings also hurriedly followed him.

The city that the Yan Clan lived in was very large. Rather than calling it a city, it would be more accurate to describe it as a country. The area covered by that world spirit formation was extremely vast. It covered everything as far as the eye could see, and appeared to be boundless.

At this moment, Chu Feng and the others, under the leadership of Dugu Xingfeng, had arrived at the northeastern region of the Yan Clan’s city.

This place was a mountain range. There were tall mountains, waterfalls, flowers, plants, trees, and even wild boar, wild dogs, wild hares and other small animals.

However, there were no buildings in this region. The airs of nature were very heavy in this place. When compared with the beautiful and exquisite palaces, this place came as a clear contrast.

Around this mountain range was a layer of a completely new spirit formation. This spirit formation was many times more powerful than the one that covered the place where the Yan Clan lived. The two spirit formations could simply not be discussed alongside one another.

There were eight elders that sat cross-legged at the foot of the mountain. Each and every one of them were very old and possessed a head full of white hair. They sat there motionlessly, like eight ancient bells. As for their auras, they were actually the same as Dugu Xingfeng and the others; they were all peak Half Martial Emperors.

“Woosh~~~”

When Chu Feng and the others approached, the eight elders all opened their eyes simultaneously. Their overbearing and sharp gazes began to shoot toward Chu Feng and the others. Those gazes were extremely chilly.

However, when they saw the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief, the chilliness in their gazes instantly vanished.

None of them said anything. Instead, they all spread open their palms in unison. Then, a world spirit key flew out from each of their palms, a total of eight keys.

After the eight world spirit keys fused together, they shot out a ray of light. That ray of light landed on the world spirit formation and left behind an entrance.

“What an amazing world spirit formation,” Seeing this, Chu Feng’s eyes shone with admiration.

Although the spirit formation that the Yan Clan had placed around the city was very strong, Chu Feng was certain that he could open it, given sufficient time. However, this spirit formation was something that Chu Feng would not be able to open no matter how hard he tried.

“It’s a masterpiece of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,” Hong Qiang said.

“A Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist? I see, it’s not surprising then,” Chu Feng knew what sort of existence Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists were. They were the most powerful world spiritists in the entire Holy Land of Martialism. With merely a thought, they could topple mountains and overturn the sea. They were existences akin to gods.

However, Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists were extremely rare. In the entire Holy Land of Martialism, they were people who could be counted with one’s fingers. As the Yan Clan did not possess World Spiritists, it meant that they must have asked someone else to help them set up this spirit formation.

However, upon closer thought, Chu Feng found it to not be anything surprising. Back then, the Yan Clan had been at the apex of the Holy Land of Martialism. Thus, they most definitely had managed to get to know a lot of people. To be able to request the help of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist would not be strange.

“Everyone, please,” As the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he walked into the large mountain range before them. Seeing that, Chu Feng and the others immediately followed after him.

The mountain road was very rugged. However, the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief continued to walk on the ground the entire time. Likely, there was some sort of rule. Thus, Chu Feng and the others found it unsuitable to fly in this place. As such, they followed closely behind the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief the entire time.

Fortunately, even though they were all walking on the ground, their speed was still very fast. Soon, they arrived at a ravine.

When looking from outside the ravine, everything appeared to be normal. However, when they arrived at the edge of the ravine and looked down below, it became a magnificent sight.

Red flames were rising from below. Being able to topple mountains and overturn the seas, it was a true sea of flames. Waves of flames were surging into the sky like fiery dragons coming out from the sea. It was extremely mighty.

These flames were no ordinary flames. Even though Chu Feng was very close to the flames, he was unable to sense the slightest bit of warmth from them. However, if he were to fall into the sea of flames, then, not to mention him, even people like Dugu Xingfeng would be instantly burned to ashes.

A Martial Emperor’s might was something that no one could resist.
