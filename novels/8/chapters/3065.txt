Chapter 3065 - Came For Revenge

“It’s the Li Heavenly Clan. It really is the Li Heavenly Clan.”

“Milord, what’s going on here? Wasn’t it said that the Upper Realm Gate’s opening has been slowed down? Why would the Li Heavenly Clan appear here so quickly?”

At this moment, many of the people present were panicking. Even the grand characters present were panicking.

They were unable to see through that Li Heavenly Clan’s war chariot. As such, they did not know what sort of expert was inside, and became worried because of that.

After all, if the Li Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders were inside the war chariot, a battle would be unavoidable. It would not only be the Chu Heavenly Clan that would end up suffering, even they would be implicated.

At the moment when the crowd was panicking, the Saintly Stellar Monk spoke, “Don’t panic, they’re merely people of the younger generation.”

While others were unable to see through that war chariot, the war chariot was unable to hide its occupants from the Saintly Stellar Monk’s eyes.

“Younger generation?” The crowd were all surprised after hearing those words.

Soon, that war chariot arrived before the crowd.

At that moment, everyone’s gaze was focused on the war chariot.

FInally, the spirit formation gate on the war chariot started to squirm. Following that, people began to walk out of the war chariot.

There were a total of fifteen people, six women and nine men, all people of the younger generation.

All of them had imposing appearances. One could tell with a single glance that they were extraordinary individuals.

Even though their auras were deliberately concealed through the use of special treasures, one could still tell that they were very powerful.

When those fifteen people appeared, practically all of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generations were eclipsed by them.

“They really are people of the younger generation.”

“Why would a bunch of people from the younger generation come here?”

“That Li Heavenly Clan is looking down on us too much, no? They’ve actually dispatched a group of their younger generations?”

After verifying that the people inside the war chariot were indeed a group of younger men and women, the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were all confused as to what the Li Heavenly Clan was thinking.

“Lord Saintly Monk, you’re also here?”

Right at that moment, a man in white walked out and respectfully greeted the Saintly Stellar Monk.

Not only were Li Youbin and the other seven people of the younger generation that had entered the Upper Realm Gate present among the fifteen, but even Li Anzhi’s younger brother Li Tianyou was present.

However, the leader among them was a man in white.

That man in white had a youthful look to his face. While he was not particularly handsome, he gave off a very extraordinary air. He had very fair skin, and was holding a folding fan. As he clasped his fist to respectfully greet the Staintly Stellar Monk, he looked very refined.

“Little friend Li Yan, it has been some time since we last met. Your cultivation has increased again,” the Saintly Stellar Monk replied with a smile on his face.

The Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations had all concealed their cultivation through the use of treasures. Even experts like Li Hanpeng were unable to determine their cultivation.

However, the Saintly Stellar Monk was able to see through their cultivation. He knew very well that that man by the name of Li Yan was actually a rank five Heavenly Immortal.

Such a cultivation was actually not particularly powerful when placed in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

However, when compared to the younger generations of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Li Yan would be an existence that they could only look up to.

“Senior is flattering me,” Li Yan clasped his fist in response.

“Li Yan, he is that Li Yan?”

“Reportedly, he was deemed to be one of the Li Heavenly Clan’s three great geniuses with Li Ming and Li Anzhi during his youth.”

“Even though his later progress did not match up to Li Anzhi and Li Ming, he can still be counted as the Li Heavenly Clan’s number two genius ever since Li Ming died.”

“I’d heard that he was a rank four Heavenly Immortal.”

“What? He’s a rank four Heavenly Immortal at such a young age? This is simply too powerful, no? Is that the disparity between our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and the Li Heavenly Clan?”

There were people present among the crowd that had heard of Li Yan and knew of his reputation. At that moment, they immediately began to spiritedly discuss what they had heard of him.

Right at that moment, Chu Hanpeng asked, “Little friends, what might have brought you all to our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?”

“Senior, we have come here today seeking an individual,” Li Yan clasped his fist.

Even though Li Yan knew that they would become enemies in the future, he was acting very courteously, and was displaying the modesty that a person of the younger generation should possess.

“Who might you be seeking?” Chu Hanpeng asked.

“He should be someone from your Chu Heavenly Clan. However, I do not know exactly what his name is. I hope that he can come forward on his own,” as Li Yan spoke, he deliberately cast his gaze upon the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations present.

“Why are you seeking him?” Chu Hanpeng asked.

“He has injured the brothers of my clan in the Upper Realm Gate. I have not come here today for the sake of obtaining justice for them. I merely want him to know that our Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations are not as weak as he imagined,” Li Yan said.

“This...”

At that moment, the crowd all involuntarily turned their gazes to Chu Zhiyuan.

To have entered the Upper Realm Gate and defeated the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, there should be no one other than Chu Zhiyuan that could have done that. After all, Chu Zhiyuan was the only person among the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations that could possibly defeat the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

Furthermore, it was known that Chu Zhiyuan had entered the Upper Realm Gate and destroyed the main formation.

At that moment, the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm began to look at Chu Zhiyuan with even more reverence in their eyes. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They only knew that Chu Zhiyuan had entered the Upper Realm Gate and destroyed the main formation, and didn’t know that he had clashed with the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

When thinking of how Chu Zhiyuan fought against the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations for the sake of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s safety, how could they not feel admiration for him?

However, they had no idea that Chu Zhiyuan was completely stunned upon hearing what Li Yan said.

After all, he did not enter the Upper Realm Gate, much less fight against the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

“What’s wrong? You dared injure us back then, yet do not dare to admit to it now?”

“So the strongest person of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations is actually a coward,” seeing that Chu Feng was nowhere to be seen, Li Tianyou started to mock him.

“Who told you that I, Chu Zhiyuan, am a coward?” Right at that moment, Chu Zhiyuan suddenly spoke.

He had no choice but to speak up. After all, everyone knew that he was the strongest member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation.

“You are not qualified to speak to me. Go and call the strongest member of your Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation out,” Li Tianyou said.

“I am the strongest,” Chu Zhiyuan said.

“You?”

Hearing Chu Zhiyuan’s words, Li Tianyou laughed mockingly. He took a disdainful glance at Chu Zhiyuan. His eyes were filled with contempt.

Although Chu Zhiyuan was also a Heavenly Immortal, he was only a rank one Heavenly Immortal. That level of cultivation was simply not something that Li Tianyou would place in his eyes.

Right at that moment, someone from the crowd said, “Little friend, perhaps you might not know about it, but little friend Chu Zhiyuan is the strongest person of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generation.”

“Oh?” Hearing those words, the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations all carefully looked to Chu Zhiyuan.

“The person that I’m calling for is the one that destroyed the main formation in the Upper Realm Gate,” Li Tianyou emphasized.

“There’s no mistake then, that formation was destroyed by none other then little friend Chu Zhiyuan,” this time, more people spoke at the same time.

“It’s not him,” Li Tianyou said.

“How could it not be him? Little friend, you should have your clan’s younger generations that were injured by him come and recognize little friend Chu Zhiyuan,” the crowd said.

“I said it’s not him so it’s not him! Younger generations that were injured by him?! This young master is also a person of the younger generation that was injured by him!” Right at that moment, Li Tianyou yelled furiously.

Li Tianyou felt that the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were deliberately insulting him. That was why he became so furious.

However, upon hearing what he said, the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were all confused.

It was clearly Chu Zhiyuan who had destroyed the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s main formation. Why would the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations say that it was not him?

Right at that moment, Li Yan said, “Seniors, the one who injured our clansmen is this person.”

As he spoke, he flipped his palm, and a picture scroll floated out from his hand toward the sky. Once that scroll opened, it immediately increased in size.

Everyone present was able to clearly see the image on that scroll.

“This...”

When the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm saw the image on the scroll, they were all stunned; their expressions changed enormously.

The reason for that was because the image on that scroll was Chu Feng.
