Chapter 4595: There’s Still a Long Road Ahead

Chu Feng’s eyes were still directed at the Asura Graveyard.

It was based on instincts that he managed to recognize the Asura Graveyard, but right now, he felt a sense of summoning from it. He couldn’t explain this feeling clearly, but it seemed like there was some sort of mysterious power that was compelling him to step forth.

This made the Asura Graveyard look exceptionally tempting to him.

“Big brother Chu Feng, it’ll do as long as we obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. There’s no need to compete for the slots,” Song Yun advised.

She was saying these words because she had a good idea just what the kind of people participating in the matchmaking convention was.

As talented as Chu Feng was, the ones who would be participating in the matchmaking convention were the most talented junior world spiritists of the Nine Souls Galaxy. Their strength wasn’t something that the Holy Light Galaxy could hope to match up to.

“I’ll obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl for you first,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

Following that, the two of them continued heading forward.

There had been barely anyone in sight ever since they entered the Graveyard Realm, but the closer they got to the Incubation Forest, the more people they could see. Most of these people were of the younger generation. There were also some elders here and there, but it would seem like they were here as accompaniment.

All of a sudden, a whirring sound echoed from behind, and the air started to tremor.

Turning around, Chu Feng saw numerous massive beasts zapping across the air. All of these beasts looked identical to one another, boasting a height of a thousand meters and a length of over ten thousand meters.

And what was even more impressive was that there were several thousand of them in the sky.

They were dragging a war chariot that was so humongous that it looked as if a mobile continent.

The emergence of this war chariot immediately dispersed the cultivator in the region. Chu Feng was also quickly pulled to the side by Song Yun.

Despite how bulky it was, the war chariot moved at an extremely fast speed. It was still a long distance away a moment ago, but in the blink of an eye, it had already passed by Chu Feng and the others before disappearing in the direction of the Incubation Forest.

“The Gongsun Clan?”

“What amazing airs!”

Even as the war chariot got further and further, Chu Feng was still able to clearly discern the flags fluttering above the war chariot. The words ‘Gongsun Clan’ were written clearly on them.

“That’s one of the two strongest world spiritist clans in the Nine Souls Galaxy, the Gongsun Clan. It’s said that the Wretched Black Demon has sent out 7 invitation letters in total, and three of them were directed to the Gongsun Clan,” Song Yun explained.

“What about the other clan?” Chu Feng asked.

“The other clan is the Zhuge Clan. Rumors have it that the Zhuge Clan has obtained 4 invitation letters, and there are only ten candidacy slots in total for the matchmaking convention,” Song Yun said.

“In other words, there will only be three more people chosen in the selection round in the Incubation Forest?” Chu Feng asked.

“Aiyo, how smart! As expected of my big brother Chu Feng!” Song Yun teased with a giggle.

“Heh, you lass! Do you know what’s the level of the strongest juniors in the Gongsun Clan and the Zhuge Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ve heard rumors that the strongest juniors of the Zhuge Clan and Gongsun Clan have grasped rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation.”

“Rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Hearing those words, it dawned on Chu Feng that the junior world spiritists of the Nine Souls Galaxy were really not to be underestimated. One must know that rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation was on par with rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivators!

“The strongest junior of the Zhuge Clan goes by the name of Zhuge Feiluan, and the one for the Gongsun Clan is no other than Gongsun Yuntian. They have a resounding reputation in the Nine Souls Galaxy, but they have gone into closed-doors training for quite a while now. There are many speculations flying about regarding how strong they are at the moment,” Song Yun said.

“Does that mean to say that Zhuge Feiluan and Gongsun Yuntian are the strongest ones amongst the junior world spiritists of the Nine Souls Galaxy?” Chu Feng asked.

“Indeed. There are rumors though that Zhuge Feiluan and Gongsun Yuntian have once crossed blows with one another, but Gongsun Yuntian wasn’t a match for Zhuge Feiluan at all. However, these are just rumors, and neither the Zhuge Clan nor the Gongsun Clan has verified this matter before,” Song Yun supplemented.

“I see.”

Chu Feng noted down what Song Yun had just said. He thought that unless he were to venture into other galaxies outside of the Holy Light Galaxy and Nine Souls Galaxy, otherwise it was likely that he would bump into those two.

“Big brother Chu Feng, why are you asking about all these? It can’t be that you’re really intending to compete with them over the Wretched Black Demon’s granddaughter, are you?

“I’m trying to put you down, but you’re still slightly weaker than them being at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation. You shouldn’t put yourself at risk here!” Song Yun said worriedly.

“Who told you that I’m at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation? I’m at rank two right now.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng began rushing his way forth once more. The Incubation Forest was already within sight, so even without Song Yun leading the way, Chu Feng was still able to find his way over.

“What? If you’re at rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation, that makes it even more impossible!” Song Yun exclaimed as she quickly followed Chu Feng from behind.

Finally, the two of them arrived at the Incubation Forest.

The Incubation Forest was made up of countless towering trees, some of them so tall that they pierced through the clouds. The closer Chu Feng approached the Incubation Forest, the more minute he felt. It was almost as if he was entering the world of the giants.

This vast forest was being sealed off by a layer of barrier. Clearly, this was the Wretched Black Demon’s doing.

However, there was a spirit formation gate leading straight into the Incubation Forest opened up in the vicinity. The juniors who wished to participate in the matchmaking convention could accept the challenge by entering it.

However, there were conditions to this matchmaking convention too, of course.

First, one must be of hundred years old or less.

Second, one must be a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist at the very least. Those who failed to reach this mark would be forbidden from entering the Incubation Forest.

Either of these two conditions was actually not too rare, but when put together, it was a requirement so harsh that only a few could meet them.

It was due to this was Chu Feng was so shocked.

“Are all of these people really Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists?”

Having arrived at the entrance of the Incubation Forest, Chu Feng could see a huge crowd of people standing in a line, undergoing checks by the Wretched Black Demon’s underlings. Almost every single one of them was granted entry into the Incubation Forest in the end.

This showed that the quality of world spiritists in the Nine Souls Galaxy was really far above that of the Holy Light Galaxy,

“Is this the gap between the two galaxies? Interesting,” Chu Feng thought with a smile.

Once again, he felt the gap that stood between the two galaxies, but instead of disheartening him, he felt excited. He had always been someone who was interested in challenges, and in the face of stronger rivals that he could become stronger himself. Only challenges could stimulate him and make him stronger than ever.

And this was what growth was.

Chu Feng had grown extremely quickly. Compared to back then, he was already becoming stronger at an unprecedented speed.

However, when he saw all of these prodigious world spiritists from the Nine Souls Galaxy, he realized that there was still a long way ahead of him.

If he was really serious about challenging the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, he had to overcome these peers of his first.
