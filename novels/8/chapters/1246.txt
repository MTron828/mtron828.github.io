MGA: Chapter 1247 - To Endure Silently

“Senior brother Qin, junior brother Chu Feng and junior sister Ruochen are my friends. Although I do not know how the two of them came to offend you, I hope that you would be willing to give me face and not make things difficult for them anymore,” Jiang Furong said calmly with a smile on her face.

When he heard those words, Qin Lingyun’s eyes started to narrow, and his expression immediately changed. However, in the end, he calmed himself and turned to Bai Ruochen, “Regardless of which Imperial Clan you’re from, it’d be best for you to know your place in this Cyanwood Mountain. Otherwise, even if you have junior sister Jiang behind you, I will still not let you go.”

After he finished saying these words, Qin Lingyun flicked his sleeves, turned around and left. However, he suddenly stopped after walking a short distance away.

He turned around, looked to Chu Feng and sneered, “Earlier, you said you were going to kill me?”

“If you think you have the ability, then you can come and give it a try.”

“Bastard!” Hearing those words, Chu Feng propped himself back up. However, after hesitating, he did not attack Qin Lingyun.

“For a nobleman to take revenge, ten years is not too long.”

“For a nobleman to take revenge, ten years is not too long.”

“For a nobleman to take revenge, ten years is not too long.”

These words continued to resound through Chu Feng’s heart. He was urging himself, urging himself to not take on the bait of Qin Lingyun’s provocation. In the end, he decided to endure.

“Humph, trash.” When he saw that Chu Feng did not try to attack him, Qin Lingyun snorted coldly in disappointment. After he said those words, he turned and left. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Hahaha, you’re nothing more than trash. You only dare to act so arrogant before us. Before senior brother Qin, you’re nothing more than trash.”

At this moment, Tao Xiangyu and the others seized the opportunity to mock Chu Feng. Once again, laughter filled with mockery sounded through this region of space.

“Is it very funny?”

“If you really want to laugh, then it’s better for you to wait until junior brother Chu Feng is as old as you all are before laughing at him.”

“At that time, I truly wonder if you all would have the ability to laugh.” Right at this moment, Jiang Furong suddenly shouted those words.

Once she said those words, the world immediately started to tremble, and a boundless oppressive might swept through heaven and earth, penetrating deep into the bodies of everyone there.

At this moment, Tao Xiangyu and their army of tens of thousands all stopped laughing. No one dared to laugh at Chu Feng again.

Jiang Furong, this existence which was ranked third on the Cyanwood Succession List, most definitely did not have an undeserved reputation.

When even someone like Qin Lingyun have to give Jiang Furong face, how could people like them possibly be able to do anything to her?

“It is one thing to bully the young. Yet you all actually relied on your superior strength to bully the weak. Is this all the honor that you all have? Scram, I do not wish to see vile characters like you bunch.” Jiang Furong added.

“Jiang Furong, you best not be excessive in your speech. You called us vile characters, are you implying that you’re a good person?” Bai Yunxiao reprimanded her angrily. Even though he knew that he was inferior to Jiang Furong, he was unable to tolerate being humiliated before this many people.

“Bai Yunxiao, I do not care what others view you all as. However, in my eyes, you all are nothing more than little vile characters. Do you have an objection to it?”

At this moment, Jiang Furong’s long, shapely eyebrows suddenly creased. At the same time, a fierce killing intent soared through the sky.

Her killing intent was not only aimed toward Bai Yunxiao. Instead, it penetrated through the hearts of all of the tens of thousands of people that had surrounded Chu Feng’s territory.

“You...” To be humiliated by Jiang Furong in such a manner caused Bai Yunxiao to be extremely angered. However, after he sensed Jiang Furong’s oppressive might and killing intent, he hesitated and did not dare to attack.

“Senior brother Bai, forget about it. Let’s wait till senior brother Mowen comes out from his closed-door training to teach this woman a lesson,” Seeing that the situation was far from good, Tao Xiangyu hurriedly sent Bai Yunxiao a voice transmission.

After hearing what Tao Xiangyu said, even though Bai Yunxiao was extremely unwilling, in the end, he still waved his sleeve and led the crowd from the Heaven Inquiring Division and left.

After Bai Yunxiao left, Tao Xiangyu, Qi Yanyu, Zhao Jingan and the others also led their subordinates and hurriedly left. None of them were willing to fight with Jiang Furong.

When even the main characters left, the crowd that had come to enjoy the show naturally would not dare to stay any longer. In merely a short moment, the vast sea of people had all dispersed.

At this moment, Chu Feng was treating Bai Ruochen’s injuries. Even though Bai Ruochen was only superficially injured, Chu Feng was enraged to see her covered in blood and felt it was extremely difficult to control himself.

“Junior brother Chu Feng, is junior sister Ruochen alright?” Jiang Furong had not left. Instead, she walked toward them.

“Thank you, senior sister Jiang, for your concern. Ruochen is alright, they are merely superficial wounds,” Bai Ruochen replied in a grateful manner. Being meticulously treated by Chu Feng, her wounds were mostly healed now, and she no longer felt any pain.

However, even though she had a smile on her face, she was forcing that smile. She who was very prideful had been forced by Qin Lingyun to publicly kneel and thus felt an extremely great amount of humiliation.

“Junior sister Ruochen, junior brother Chu Feng, the two of you are still young. The reason why Qin Lingyun is able to defeat you two is simply because he has cultivated for longer than you two.”

“However, if you were of the same age, I firmly believe that, with the talent that the two of you possess, Qin Lingyun would most definitely not be your match,” As if she had seen Bai Ruochen’s unpleasantness, Jiang Furong consoled her.

“Senior sister Jiang, please rest assured. If we cannot deal with a small matter like this, then we would be carrying the title of disciples of the Cyanwood Forest in vain,” Chu Feng smiled calmly.

After he took a glance at Bai Ruochen, he asked, “Merely, senior sister Jiang, I do not understand why Qin Lingyun detested the Imperial Clansmen like that. Could it be that he has some sort of history with the Imperial Clansmen?”

Hearing those words, Jiang Furong was startled. A trace of surprise flashed past her intelligent eyes.

To outsiders, Qin Lingyun might appear to have come for the sake of Tao Xiangyu, and intentionally come to attack Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.

However, Chu Feng surprised her. Not only was he able to tell that Qin Lingyun had come for the sake of making things difficult for Bai Ruochen, he even managed to guess that there must be some sort of history between Qin Lingyun and the Imperial Clansmen.

“I do not know very well about matters regarding Qin Lingyun,” Jiang Furong shook her head and pretended to know nothing.

However, at the moment when Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were disappointed, a voice transmission entered their ears. As for that voice transmission, it was from Jiang Furong.

“What junior brother Chu Feng said is correct. Qin Lingyun detests the Imperial Clansmen. Naturally, there is a reason for that.”

“Qin Lingyun had once been seriously injured and humiliated by a young Imperial Clansman. Furthermore, that young Imperial Clansman was much younger than he was.”

“Qin Lingyun was known to be the strongest in the Cyanwood Mountain, and was practically unparalleled among the younger generation. After that incident, a knot was left in his heart, and he began to deeply detest the Imperial Clansmen.”

“So that’s the case. Thank you senior sister Jiang,” After learning of the matter, Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen both expressed their thanks via voice transmission.

“That matter I spoke of is a secret. It would be best for the two of you to not spread it to anyone else. Or else, if Qin Lingyun were to find out about it, he would definitely not let the two of you off. At that time, even I would not be able to stop him,” Jiang Furong warned.

“We understand.” Both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were intelligent people. Merely by Jiang Furong’s decision to say that she didn’t know anything while secretly informing them about what had happened, the two of them knew that this matter was extremely serious.

After this, Jiang Furong made some casual conversation with Chu Feng before leaving his territory.

After Jiang Furong left, Bai Ruochen asked, “Chu Feng, was she the person you met in the Firmament Medicine Garden?”

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded.

“It was merely a single meeting, yet she was willing to offend Qin Lingyun and the others to help you. No matter how I see it, I feel that it’s strange,” Bai Ruochen said.

“What’s strange about it?” Chu Feng asked.

“She’s either truly a kind-hearted good person or she’s someone who possesses a scheme,” Bai Ruochen said.

After he heard what Bai Ruochen said, Chu Feng smiled a relieved smile. He said, “Don’t think about it too much. For some matters, it is not good to overcomplicate them.”

“Don’t tell me that you do not suspect her motives?” Bai Ruochen asked.

“All I know is the truth. And that is, she has helped us today,” Chu Feng said.

After hearing what Chu Feng said, Bai Ruochen was startled. After that, she spoke no more and started to thoughtfully look toward the direction in which Jiang Furong had left.

As for Jiang Furong, although she flew toward the direction of her own territory, she did not return to her territory. Instead, after circling around, she arrived at a forest before descending.

“You’ve completed it?” A voice sounded from the forest.

“Mn,” Jiang Furong replied respectfully.
