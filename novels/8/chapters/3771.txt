Chapter 3771 - Departure

“Oh, that’s right. Little brother Chu Feng, your big sister will be entering closed-door training for some time. Does your Chu Heavenly Clan have a place your big sister can use for closed-door training?” Bai Liluo asked Chu Feng.

Before Chu Feng could say anything, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said, “Of course. It is our Chu Heavenly Clan’s honor to be able to provide young lady with a place to undergo closed-door training. We will definitely provide the best location for young lady to use for training.”

“Merely, young lady, when will you need this place?”

“Thank you. I need it right away,” said Bai Liluo.

“Big sister Liluo, you need to enter closed-door training right away?” asked Chu Feng.

“Right. Right away. Immediately. At once,” Bai Liluo said with a beaming smile.

After she finished saying those words, she patted Chu Feng’s shoulder. “Don’t look so worried. Do you not trust your big sister?”

“Even that Black-feathered Specter was nearly refined by your big sister. How could I not be able to handle the curse it has left on my body?”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled and said, “Of course I believe in big sister Liluo.”

Then, Bai Liluo really ended up undergoing closed-door training in the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After Bai Liluo entered closed-door training, the smile on Chu Feng’s face disappeared at once.

Although he believed in Bai Liluo, he had also witnessed how powerful the Black-feathered Specter was.

Thus, Chu Feng was still worried about the curse it had left on her.

Chu Feng did not want Bai Liluo to suffer the torment of the curse for the rest of her life.

“Young friend Chu Feng, it seems like you have an extraordinary relationship with that young lady,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said to Chu Feng after Bai Liluo left for closed-door training.

“I guess we can be said to be close friends that have experienced life and death together," said Chu Feng. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After hearing those words from Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu was able to confirm that Bai Liluo held great importance to Chu Feng.

“Curses are things that cannot be handled with ordinary world spirit techniques.”

“However, since a curse can be cast on someone, it can naturally be removed too. There is nothing in the world that cannot be undone.”

“In the past, I ran across a certain individual. Although his capability as a world spiritist was rather limited, he was a master at both casting and removing curses.”

“Merely, as it has been many years since then, I do not know if he’s still around," said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Chu Feng’s expression changed upon hearing those words. He hurriedly asked, “Senior, who is the person you’re talking about? Do you know where he might be located?”

“I’ve actually only met that man once. I only know that he is surnamed Tang but do not know his full name.”

“Furthermore, he is not someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Instead, he’s from the All-heaven Starfield.”

“As for where he is located...”

“He actually left me a location. He told me that the place is his hometown, that he will return to settle there, and told me I could pay him a visit there in the future.”

“That place is located in the All-heaven Starfield’s Reincarnation Upper Realm’s Seven Suns Mountain Range’s Southeastern region. It is called Autumnfall Village,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“The Reincarnation Upper Realm’s Seven Suns Mountain Range?”

Chu Feng revealed a look of surprise upon hearing those words.

Sensing that Chu Feng’s expression was strange, Grandmaster Liangqiu asked, “Is there an issue, young friend Chu Feng?”

“It’s nothing.” Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.

“That place is indeed a bit dangerous. After all, it’s located in the All-heaven Starfield.”

“However, with your world spirit techniques, I believe that very few people will be able to see through you if you are to disguise yourself,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

The Reincarnation Upper Realm was located in the All-heaven Starfield. As for the All-heaven Starfield, it was controlled by the All-heaven Sect.

Because of that, Grandmaster Liangqiu felt that the change in Chu Feng’s expression was because he was afraid of the All-heaven Sect.

However, that was actually not the reason.

Instead, Chu Feng was planning to proceed for the All-heaven Starfield from the very start.

Chu Feng needed to proceed to the All-heaven Starfield to seek out the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s friend and break his formation to complete the agreement he had made with his friend.

That said, the location where the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s friend was located was also the All-heaven Starfield’s Reincarnation Upper Realm.

That was already a matter of extreme coincidence.

However, what was even more of a coincidence was that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s friend was not only located in the Reincarnation Upper Realm, but his residence also happened to be in the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

It was due to this coincidence that Chu Feng felt so astonished.

“Lord Clan Chief, I will be leaving the Ancestral Martial Starfield for a while," Chu Feng said to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“You’re planning to seek out a method to remove the curse?” asked the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“That’s not all. I also need to complete a task senior Daoist gave to me.”

“Because of that, I might be away for a while," said Chu Feng.

“Very well.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had learned that it was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist that had given Chu Feng the grand protective formation that had nearly eliminated the entire Linghu Heavenly Clan, and his Divine Power.

As such, he knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was a great benefactor to Chu Feng and his Chu Heavenly Clan.

Naturally, Chu Feng could not neglect a task given by his benefactor.

Seeing that Chu Feng was truly planning to proceed for the Reincarnation Upper Realm, Grandmaster Liangqiu said, “Chu Feng, I just so happen to have not paid a visit to that friend of mine. How about we travel together?”

“Senior, you don’t have to trouble yourself with this matter. It’s better that I handle things myself.”

Chu Feng knew that Grandmaster Liangqiu did not possess a deep friendship with that friend he spoke of. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have not bothered to pay a visit to said friend after so many years.

The reason why Grandmaster Liangqiu made such a suggestion was because he wanted to protect Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng didn’t wish to involve Grandmaster Liangqiu. He felt that it would be a show of respect if he were to complete the task from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist on his own.

After making his decision, Chu Feng immediately set off.

As the All-heaven Starfield was the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s neighbor, Chu Feng was able to reach the Reincarnation Upper Realm through teleportation formations in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Merely, the distance between starfields was most definitely not something that upper realms could compare to.

Thus, it would naturally take longer to arrive.

So in order to allow Chu Feng to reach his destination sooner, Grandmaster Liangqiu gave Chu Feng his treasure that was able to accelerate his speed inside the teleportation formation.

Normally, a treasure like that would be incomparably precious. Because of that, Chu Feng was reluctant to accept it.

However, Chu Feng wanted to reach the Reincarnation Upper Realm quickly. Thus, he decided that he would borrow Grandmaster Liangqiu’s treasure and accept it for the time being.

Gu Mingyuan, Grandmaster Liangqiu, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Lingxi were all there to see him off.

After witnessing Chu Feng enter the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation and disappear into it, Chu Lingxi turned her gaze to Gu Mingyuan.

“Mother, let’s return to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.”

“Lingxi, why do you suddenly wish to return?”

Gu Mingyuan was surprised. She knew that Chu Lingxi possessed deep affection for the Chu Heavenly Clan. When she was training in the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, she was complaining about returning to the Chu Heavenly Clan the entire time.

Gu Mingyuan had thought that it would be difficult to have Chu Lingxi return to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan once she returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Because of that, she was very surprised when Chu Lingxi made the request to return to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan on her own.

“I must strive to train. Otherwise, I will truly be unable to catch up to that little brother of mine called Chu Feng," Chu Lingxi said to Gu Mingyuan with a smile.

Gu Mingyuan was pleasantly surprised upon hearing those words. In fact, she was unable to contain her smile.

She was truly overjoyed. Very rarely did she smile with such joy.

Seeing the joyous Gu Mingyuan, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Chu Xuanzhengfa were all surprised, and even confused.

They did not understand why Gu Mingyuan would be suddenly so happy.

Gu Mingyuan turned to Chu Lingxi and asked with a skeptical tone, “Lingxi, you’ve truly decided?”
