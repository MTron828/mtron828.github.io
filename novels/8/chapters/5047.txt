Chapter 5047: The Prophecy is Coming True

“Of course, there’s no way I would turn her away after she has displayed such impressive talents. However, I have to confirm whether she’s willing to come with us to the Monstrous Spirit Clan or not since it’ll be dangerous,” Yao Cheng said before turning to Wang Yuxian.

However, the Lady of Dao Sea answered before Wang Yuxian could say a word at all, “She’s willing! My disciple is willing to go with you!”

“Master, what does this elder mean?” Wang Yuxian asked out of curiosity.

“Lele, a calamity is about to befall our Nine Souls Galaxy, and you’ll have a chance to stop it from happening.”

The Lady of Dao Sea looked at Wang Yuxian expectantly as she explained the circumstances to the latter.

“I never thought that something like this would happen. Elder, master, I’m willing to accompany Chu Feng to the Monstrous Spirit Clan.”

Wang Yuxian accepted the offer without any hesitation. She turned to look at Chu Feng with a smile, seemingly looking forward to fighting alongside him.

“Let’s set off then,” Yao Cheng said.

Soon, they returned to where Yao Cheng had previously brought them to. Yao Cheng took out a spirit formation key.

“This key…” Chu Feng murmured with a contemplative gleam in his eyes.

“What’s wrong, Chu Feng?” Yu Sha asked, having overheard what Chu Feng had said.

“It’s nothing.”

Chu Feng shook his head.

He had felt a sense of familiarity from the spirit formation key, but he couldn’t tell where this sense of familiarity was coming from. However, if there was one thing he was sure of, this spirit formation key didn’t belong to the Monstrous Spirit Clan. There wasn’t the slightest monstrous spirit aura on it at all.

Even so, Yao Cheng was still able to fuse her aura into the spirit formation key without any problem.

Weng!

The spirit formation gate released a blinding light, and a thousand meters tall spirit formation gate began to form.

The Lady of Dao Sea and the Godwish Grandmother frowned at the sight of the spirit formation gate. They could sense just how resilient the spirit formation gate was, such that it was impossible for them to pass through it.

It was one thing if it was just resilient, but the spirit formation gate had a defensive mechanism to it too. Anyone who wasn’t a member of the Monstrous Spirit Clan who attempted to barge through the spirit formation gate would be halted by it and even face danger.

“Elder, will they really be able to pass through that?”

The Lady of Dao Sea looked at Yao Cheng with worry in her eyes. She could tell that the spirit formation gate was guarded against all outsiders, including juniors. It was unlike the ancient remnants, where one could enter freely as long as one was a junior.

Yao Cheng rose into the sky and headed over to the top of the spirit formation gate.

“This spirit formation gate is restricted to only members of our Monstrous Spirit Clan. No one from other races is allowed to pass through it, be it elders or juniors. However, the barrier has been steadily weakening over time, such that juniors are now able to enter from this area,” Yao Cheng said as she pointed to a small area of the hulking spirit formation gate.

Upon hearing her words, Chu Feng and the others rose into the sky and scrutinized the spirit formation gate. They soon concluded that what Yao Cheng had said was true.

Upon careful examination, there was indeed a part of the spirit formation gate that was much weaker. It would still be hard for those from the older generation to pass through it, but it might just be feasible for the juniors.

The only problem was that this spirit formation gate didn’t just consist of the entrance. It was likely that there was a passageway beyond it, which would make the journey quite perilous.

“You are all world spiritists, so you should understand the risks here even if I don’t explain them to you. I’ll be frank with you. I have no idea what you’ll encounter on the other side of the spirit formation gate either, so you should think your decision through,” Yao Cheng said.

“Elder, is there no way for the two of them to enter the Monstrous Spirit Clan safely? I mean, this is the territory of your Monstrous Spirit Clan. If you wish it so, surely you should be able to allow outsiders to enter? Also, I’d like to ask what’s the way to save the Nine Souls Galaxy, that you mentioned earlier,” the Lady of Dao Sea asked.

Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian’s lives were at stake here. She wanted to first clarify the situation and see if there were any other safer alternatives.

“I’m afraid that our Monstrous Spirit Clan is unable to remove the restriction on the spirit formation gate. As for what the way is, I’ll tell these two young friends here if they are able to enter our Monstrous Spirit Clan. Otherwise, it’ll be futile even if I tell them now,” Yao Cheng said.

She then turned to Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian,

“I’ll be waiting for you inside. I’ll give you an hour. If I don’t see you within an hour, I’ll be closing this spirit formation gate.”

With those words, she entered the spirit formation gate and passed through with ease.

“Junior Chu Feng, you need not feel responsible for the affairs of the Nine Souls Galaxy. You don’t have to take this risk if you don’t want to,” the Godwish Grandmother advised Chu Feng.

“To be honest with you, I have no interest in the affairs of the Nine Souls Galaxy. However, my master is still in the hands of Sima Xiangtu. That leaves me with no choice but to meddle in this. Lele, why don’t you wait for me here? I can enter by myself,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you looking down on me? I know that you’re formidable, but I was the one who caused that incredible phenomenon earlier. I was still wondering why I would suddenly make a breakthrough at this juncture, but I get it now. It might all be for this moment,” Wang Yuxian told Chu Feng with a smile.

Despite her pure appearance, she was like a mischievous and adorable little girl. It was just that she only showed this side of hers to two people in this world, the Lady of Dao Sea and Chu Feng.

“Master, please forgive me for being unfilial, but I wish to enter the Monstrous Spirit Clan together with Chu Feng.”

Wang Yuxian turned to the Lady of Dao Sea to seek her permission.

“Lele, if you have truly thought things through, you may go ahead with it. I’ll respect your decision today,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

“Thank you, master.”

Wang Yuxian was delighted to receive the permission of her master.

“Let’s go then.”

Chu Feng made his way toward the area pointed out by Yao Cheng earlier and entered the spirit formation gate. Indeed, he was able to pass through it without any problems.

“Master, Senior Aunt, I’ll be heading in too.”

Wang Yuxian bowed to the Lady of Dao Sea and the Godwish Grandmother before hurriedly following suit.

“Little sister, you’re acting a little weird. I know just how fond you are of Wang Yuxian, but why are you so eager to have her shoulder this risk together with Junior Chu Feng?”

The Godwish Grandmother noticed that the Lady of Dao Sea had an expectant look on her face even though it was tinged with worry too. It was as if Wang Yuxian’s choice was the one she had hoped for too. This was different from how the Lady of Dao Sea usually was.

“Big sister, do you still remember the prophecy I told you about? Even though who would stop the Nine Souls Galaxy’s calamity was eventually changed to Junior Chu Feng, the one who first showed up was still none other than my Lele.

“I didn’t understand back then why Lele would show up when Junior Chu Feng was the one who would stop the calamity, but I think I finally get it now. Our Lele has the ability to stop the calamity too.

“Just wait and see. They’ll surely succeed. I’m confident that they’ll be able to safely enter the Monstrous Spirit Clan and stop the Nine Souls Galaxy’s calamity. This is heaven’s will, something that had been predestined right from the start!” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

“Is the Spirit Rock of Prophecies really that accurate?”

The Godwish Grandmother fell into deep thoughts upon hearing those words.

She was reluctant to believe in prophecies, thinking that they were just superstitions. She thought that cultivators should prioritize strength, for the world of cultivation only respected the strong. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

But when she looked down on the chain of events, she couldn’t help but feel that everything had been leading up to the prophecy. It felt too much of a coincidence to call it as such. It made her wonder if the prophecy was truly real or not.

At least at this very moment, she hoped for it to be the case so that Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian could return safely from the Monstrous Spirit Clan.
