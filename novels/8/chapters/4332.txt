Chapter 4332: As Capable As the Rumors Suggest

A furious gale blew across the desert, stirring a copious amount of yellow sand into the air that covered the sky. It was a terrifying sight indeed, but it had become one of the unique sights of this desert.

It was just that there was an even more frightening sight before them at this very moment.

And that was the presence of a translucent body of light floating in the air like a fleeting cloud, enveloping the entire desert.

This translucent body of light was a formation.

This powerful formation had come from a small individual standing in the midst of the desert. Compared to the humongous formation that enveloped huge swathes of land, this individual looked like nothing more than a speck of dust.

Yet, it was due to this individual that this humongous formation had come into being.

And this individual was none other than the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

After he instructed Chu Feng on what he should do after entering the Dragon Vein Source, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist began setting up his formation.

As soon as he made his move, other than Supreme Elder Long Duan and Chu Feng, all of the other Supreme Elders present in the area were all shocked by what they saw.

They might have still doubted the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s means a moment ago, but after witnessing the grand sight before them, they were starting to believe in his abilities.

The formation that enveloped the entire desert wasn’t just massive, but the aura that it emanated was imposing as well. It wasn’t hard at all for one to imagine that there was tremendous power harnessed within it.

Other than the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted and Zhuge Yuankong, they had never seen anyone who was able to drive such a domineering formation.

And yet, the hideous-looking Ox-nosed Old Daoist was actually controlling something of this scale with extreme ease.

This made them realize that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was someone who possessed true capabilities.

“As expected of Grandmaster!”

A compliment suddenly sounded from afar.

Following that, two figures landed in the midst of the desert. They were the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and Long Xiaoxiao.

Long Xiaoxiao glanced at the imposing formation above her before turning to look at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a look of reverence in her eyes.

She walked over to Chu Feng’s side and asked, “Little benefactor, is he your master?”

Even though everyone here was kin to Long Xiaoxiao, her eyes were only the gentlest when they were looking at Chu Feng.

“Yes, this is my master,” Chu Feng replied.

“He’s incredible!” Long Xiaoxiao remarked in awe.

Had it been any other occasion, even if Long Xiaoxiao was impressed by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s capabilities, she would have never looked at him in reverence.

However, after she learned that it was due to this old man that she and her mother were freed from their quandary, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s position in her heart soared to a great height.

“This lady over here, you must be my disciple’s benefactor, Princess Xiaoxiao, right?”

At this moment, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly turned over to look at Long Xiaoxiao.

But what was even more shocking was that even though he was talking to Long Xiaoxiao, he was still forming complex hand seals one after another. He was still building up the formation smoothly, and his speed hadn’t decreased in the least.

This ability to multitask further showcased the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s formidable control over formations.

“Junior Long Xiaoxiao pays respects to elder!”

Long Xiaoxiao quickly bowed deeply. She looked so adorably obedient that it was hard not to dote on her.

“You are truly a beauty in the making. It’s no wonder why my disciple often mentions you,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Oh? Little benefactor often mentions me?” Long Xiaoxiao was surprised to hear that.

“Indeed. My disciple often talks in his dream about how beautiful Xiaoxiao is, and how he wants to hug, kiss you, and those sort of things,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied with an evil smile.

Long Xiaoxiao’s face immediately turned as red as an apple.

“This...”

Those words rendered the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the Supreme Elders speechless.

But in terms of speechlessness, there was no one who was more speechless than Chu Feng at this moment.

“Master, when have I said those words? Princess Xiaoxiao has never appeared in my dreams before,” Chu Feng quickly clarified.

“Haa, you lad! You’re a man; why can’t you just admit to it frankly?”

The Ox-nosed Daoist eyed Chu Feng disdainfully before waving his hand impatiently, saying, “Alright, cut the crap. Don’t interrupt me anymore. I need to focus on the formation!”

“You’re really...”

Chu Feng really felt like hurling expletives right now.

What the heck was wrong with his master?! Why would he slander his own disciple in public?

“It’s fine, little benefactor. I’m not someone who can’t take a joke,” Long Xiaoxiao replied smilingly.

Even though she was trying to put on a relaxed front, her scarlet face still told everyone that she wasn’t as composed as she seemed.

Boom!

All of a sudden, a slight explosion sounded in the air.

Raising their heads, the crowd saw that the humongous formation was starting to contract. At the same time, the power of the formation was getting stronger and stronger.

“Activate formation!”

All of a sudden, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist raised his hand up high before cutting it downward.

A ray of light descended from the center of the formation and enveloped the Dragon Vein Source.

Boom!

Under the prowess of the formation, the Dragon Vein Source began to shake intensely. The shaking felt a little unnerving, as if the Dragon Vein Source would collapse at any moment.

This sight made everyone in the Dragon Clan, including the Clan Chief, stiffen in tension.

One must know that the Dragon Vein Source was of utmost importance in the Dragon Clan. According to the words passed down by their ancestors, it was something that could determine the fate of the Dragon Clan.

When they saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s formation clashing against the Dragon Vein Source, words couldn’t describe just how frightened they were.

They were worried that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist might not be able to open the Dragon Vein Source, but at the same time, they were also worried that he might accidentally destroy it.

However, the two forces seemed to be of equal prowess to one another. Other than the intense shaking, nothing else seemed to be happening.

Just like that, the situation fell into a stalemate temporarily. It felt like nothing would happen in the short-term.

“Quite obstinate, huh?”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t seem to be too bothered by the current situation. His left hand continued resting by his side as he raised his right hand and pointed it into the air.

Weng!

The formation above the sky began to shudder. Following that, the light began to condense within the formation to form 46 sheets of amulets. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

These amulets were each over a hundred meters in length, and they emanated a powerful yet mysterious aura. As soon as they were formed, they descended from the sky and fell on the Dragon Vein Source in an orderly manner.

With each sheet of amulets that fell on the Dragon Vein Source, the shaking would alleviate a little.

By the time all 46 amulets were finally in place, the Dragon Vein Source had finally calmed down entirely.

Next, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist began to swiftly form a series of hand seals before bellowing loudly, “Break!”

There was a loud ‘kacha’ sound from the Dragon Vein Source, signaling that something had shattered.

Taking a closer look, at the very bottom of the Dragon Vein Source, one could see that a small slit three meters in height and one meter in width had formed.

It looked humble in comparison to the massive Dragon Vein Source, but such a sight still left everyone present with shocked faces.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had managed to deliver what he had promised. He said that he would open a slit in the Dragon Vein Source, and he had really managed to do so.

While most people did think that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would have the ability to do it, what really left them shocked was how he was able to achieve it within such a short span of time.

“A world spiritist grandmaster is indeed formidable.”

Such remarks could be heard all around yet again.

It was just that, this time around, these words were coming from the mouths of the highly-esteemed Supreme Elders of the Dragon Clan, top-notch cultivators of the Holy Light Galaxy.
