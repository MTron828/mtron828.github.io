Chapter 5568: Little Fishy VS Jie Tian

Chu Feng and Little Fishy patiently bided their time, knowing that it would be advantageous for them to wait. Jie Tian was expending a lot of energy in order to open the palace doors using his unorthodox methods, though the doors were clearly showing signs of opening.

Kacha!

A crack finally appeared in the palace doors. A blinding light spilled out of the crack.

This was no ordinary light but one harnessing formation runes, tremendous martial power, and bits of starlight. It was a unique energy made out of martial power, spirit power, and starlight. This energy gave off an amazing air of divinity, increasing one’s desire to enter the palace.

While there was no benefit to be gained from that energy, it reminded one of the fortuitous encounters that were potentially awaiting on the other side of those palace doors. The palace surely had a formidable treasure that would rattle the entire world of cultivation.

Jie Tian trembled with increasing excitement. He further channeled his spirit power into his formation, hoping to open the palace doors in a single breath. His attention was focused on the formation, and his energy was rapidly depleting.

He channeled his formation, wanting to open the doors with a single push.

“Big brother, is it despicable of me to attack him now?” Little Fishy asked.

“It is despicable against a good man but wise against a villain,” Chu Feng replied.

“Heh! I’ll be making my move then.”

Little Fishy opened her palm, revealing a bundle of revolving starlight concealed within. Amidst the starlight was an arrow harnessing terrifying prowess. It turned out that she had been making preparations all this while. Should this arrow strike, she would be able to decimate Jie Tian.

“Wait a while longer. Let him tire himself a bit more,” Chu Feng said.

While Little Fishy’s starlight arrow was formidable, he didn’t think that it was the ideal timing yet. Their chances of success could be further heightened if Jie Tian expended himself further.

“All right,” Little Fishy replied with a nod.

Chu Feng vigilantly observed the situation. He patiently waited for an ideal opportunity before exclaiming, “Now!”

Little Fishy had been waiting on standby. As soon as Chu Feng gave the word, she hurled out a punch, releasing the starlight arrow upon Jie Tian like a ferocious beast.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jie Tian was so focused on breaching the palace gates that he wasn’t aware of it at all. By the time he finally noticed it, the starlight arrow was already right behind him.

Gwah!

A bundle of black aura suddenly surged out from Jie Tian’s body to form a powerful barrier, protecting him from the starlight arrow.

The arrow ended up striking the barrier first.

The barrier shattered, but the arrow lost its momentum too. As a result, Jie Tian emerged from the collision unharmed.

“The evil power planted a protective formation inside him?”

Chu Feng had known that someone of Jie Tian’s stature was bound to have a protective formation, but he hadn’t expected it to be this powerful. On top of that, he could tell that the protective formation wasn’t planted by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion but by the evil power.

He didn’t think the evil power would value Jie Tian so much as to plant such a formidable protective formation in him. While it was only a one-time-use protective formation, it still ended up saving his life.

Even so, Jie Tian was startled by the attack. He stood frozen on the spot, unable to react right away. It was Little Fishy who made the first move.

“He has a protective formation? Why did it not appear when I injured him with my previous attacks?” Little Fishy pouted as he looked at the protective formation with a frown.

She had previously exerted her bloodline power against Jie Tian after accusing the latter of being a traitor. Even though Jie Tian eventually escaped, she still managed to hurt him, and she was certain that there was no protective formation on him then.

“The protective formation might not have been activated because that attack didn’t pose a fatal threat,” Chu Feng said.

“Come out!” a furious roar echoed.

It finally occurred to Jie Tian that someone had assaulted him after a moment of shock. He hurled his fist forth in the direction where Chu Feng and Little Fishy were. He was still unable to see them, but he could guess their positions based on the trajectory of the earlier attack.

Not only were his efforts unraveled by the untimely interruption, but he also lost a powerful protective formation on top of that. Killing intent surged forth from him as if a mad beast. He had no desire to know who assaulted him; all he wanted to do was to murder the culprit.

Little Fishy easily blocked Jie Tian’s attack, but much to her surprise, the spirit power behind his attack suddenly spread out. It turned out that there was a concealed formation hidden beneath his offense, and the formation unraveled Little Fishy’s concealment formation.

Chu Feng and Little Fishy finally appeared before Jie Tian’s eyes.

It was also then Chu Feng realized Jie Tian was not to be underestimated.

Jie Tian’s earlier daze was likely feigned; he was thinking about his next move. His assault was probably a feint too. He knew that his attack wasn’t sufficient to kill the culprit in the shadows, so he hid a formation beneath it to reveal the culprit.

“It’s you?”

Jie Tian’s ferocious expression vanished upon seeing Little Fishy and Chu Feng. His ferocity was just an act; his current expression reflected his true emotions. While he was indeed angry, it was nowhere near the point of losing his rationality.

“You’re alive?” Jie Tian asked.

Boom!

Before Chu Feng could answer the question, a powerful surge of spirit power rushed at Jie Tian. At the same time, Chu Feng felt a protective formation surrounding him.

It was Little Fishy. Both the attack and defensive formation came from her.

Not bothering to waste any words, she morphed into a flash of light and charged straight at Jie Tian as soon as she was revealed.

Powerful shockwaves rippled from her assault, ravaging everything in the vicinity. If not for Little Fishy’s protective formation, Chu Feng would have been torn into shreds.

“Chu Feng, how’s the battle going?” Eggy asked, worried about Little Fishy.

However, Chu Feng couldn’t see how the fight was going, even through his Heaven’s Eyes. Little Fishy and Jie Tian were simply too fast, as their formation armors had enhanced their abilities to a level beyond what he could see.

Thus, he closed his eyes and spread out his consciousness in an attempt to sense the ongoing battle through the rippling spirit power. A brief moment later, he frowned.

The situation wasn’t optimistic.
