Chapter 4323: A Better Candidate

Before Chu Feng could respond to the question from the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had already beaten him to it. “Indeed. This disciple of mine isn’t just acquainted with your daughter. Your daughter even saved his life once. Due to that incident, they became life-and-death buddies.

“You have to know that the procedure to activate the Dragon Vein Source is extremely dangerous, and there’s a chance that I might lose my life if something goes wrong. Nevertheless, I still agreed to help you for two reasons.

“One of them is because I wanted to enter the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground, but more than that, I wanted to return the favor to your daughter. What else can I do? It’s only right for the master to repay the debt of his disciple, don’t you agree?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist told the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Of course, I can’t agree more with your words, Grandmaster,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief nodded vehemently. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

While the Clan Chief had tried his best to maintain a poker face, Chu Feng could still see signs of awkwardness in his gestures and words.

After all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been pretty explicit with what he was driving at with his words.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was willing to help them with this matter, but his help was conditional. The compensation was one thing, but the crux actually lay with Long Xiaoxiao.

To put it in other words, if something were to happen to Long Xiaoxiao, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was likely to retract his help.

“Chu Feng, you should head over to meet your benefactor first. I can handle things here by myself. Once the preparations are in order, I’ll get Elder Long Duan to call you over,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist told Chu Feng.

“Alright, I’ll listen to your arrangements, master,” Chu Feng replied.

He then turned to Long Nanxun and said, “Brother Nanxun, I’ll be troubling you to lead the way.”

However, Long Nanxun didn’t move right away, and he wasn’t saying anything either. It seemed like he was afraid of something.

Chu Feng knew just what he was afraid of.

Given the current circumstance surrounding Long Xiaoxiao, unless the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief were to give his permission, who would dare to bring Chu Feng to her?

“Young friend Chu Feng, listen to me...” one of the Supreme Elders suddenly spoke up at this moment. The intention of this Supreme Elder wasn’t just to break the awkwardness in the air. More than that, it was likely that he would find some kind of excuse to stop Chu Feng from looking for Long Xiaoxiao.

But barely after that Supreme Elder opened his mouth, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had already cut right in, “I received news that Princess Xiaoxiao is in the Dragon Clan right now, and that she isn’t in closed-door training. Otherwise, the two of us wouldn’t have made the trip here.”

Following that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist turned to the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and continued, “Clan Chief, I understand that we have put you on a spot when we requested to enter the Dragon Clan’s Ancestral Ground, but surely meeting your daughter shouldn’t be that difficult of a request, right?”

Hearing these words from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng couldn’t help but be amazed by his master’s formidable mouth. Those words had practically sealed off all opportunities for the crowd from the Dragon Clan from fabricating lies to stall them.

Even if they did try, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would simply insist that they were lying to him.

Right now, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, who wielded the power to activate the Dragon Vein Source, held the fate of the Dragon Clan in his hands. There was no way the Dragon Clan would dare to turn against him at this juncture.

Thus, as soon as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words, Chu Feng immediately knew that he would definitely be able to meet Long Xiaoxiao.

No matter how reluctant the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was, he would have to give in on this one.

“Of course, it’s no problem at all. Nanxun, you can bring young friend Chu Feng over.”

As expected, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief relented on the matter.

Having received permission, Long Nanxun immediately led the way forward for Chu Feng. They left the desert and began rushing toward where Long Xiaoxiao was.

But halfway through the journey, Long Nanxun suddenly halted.

When Chu Feng turned his head around, he saw Long Nanxun half-kneeling on the ground. Bending his back and lowering his body, he bowed deeply to Chu Feng.

“Long Nanxun, what are you doing?” Chu Feng asked.

“Brother Chu Feng, I have eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. I beg your pardon for my earlier offense,” Long Nanxun said.

“I was still wondering what was wrong, but it turns out to just be that. Rest assured, I, Chu Feng, am not that narrow-minded. I didn’t put that matter on my mind.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he even took the initiative to walk forward and help Long Nanxun back to his feet.

Seeing that Chu Feng really wasn’t bothered by the earlier matter, Long Nanxun stood up and continued leading the way for Chu Feng.

‘Brother Chu Feng, I knew that your master was a formidable individual, but I didn’t think he would be this powerful,” Long Nanxun remarked in awe.

“What do you mean by that?” Chu Feng asked.

“Those are the Clan Chief and Supreme Elders of our Dragon Clan. Despite standing in their presence, your master was able to remain composed and control the situation. Even our Clan Chief was unable to oppose your master’s will.

“That courage and means he has are something that ordinary experts don’t possess. It’s no wonder he was able to groom a disciple like you. Just like they say, a capable teacher produces capable students,” Long Nanxun said.

“That master of mine is indeed quite formidable,” Chu Feng nodded in agreement.

“With Brother Chu Feng and your master’s help, there might be hope for Xiaoxiao and her mother,” Long Nanxun said hopefully.

Chu Feng agreed deeply with what Long Nanxun said as well.

In truth, the bulk of the problem had already been resolved with the earlier conversation.

As long as he were to successfully meet with Long Xiaoxiao, Chu Feng would be able to ‘learn’ of the hardship Long Xiaoxiao was facing, and he would angrily inform his master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, about it.

In turn, his master would then lodge a complaint with the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and make things difficult for him.

If the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief still needed the help of Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he would have no choice but to spare Long Xiaoxiao and her mother from punishment.

While such a course of action wouldn’t resolve the grudge between Long Xiaoxiao and Long Mumu, at the very least, Long Xiaoxiao and her mother would be out of danger for the time being.

And this was all thanks to the help of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Just like that, this problem Chu Feng had been troubled about was resolved so easily by his master.

Meanwhile, as Chu Feng and Lu Nanxun were rushing to where Long Xiaoxiao was, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had discerned some things from the Dragon Vein Source.

“Clan Chief, are there any talented female cultivators among the younger generations of your clan who happen to be skilled in world spiritist techniques too?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly stood up and asked after observing the area.

“Yes, Grandmaster. May I know if there’s anything I can help with?” the Dragon’s Clan Clan Chief asked.

“I can temporarily open a slit into the Dragon Vein Source from outside, but only those of the younger generation will be able to enter through it. Of those who will be entering the area, one of them will have to be my disciple, Chu Feng. The two of us will work together to properly open the Dragon Vein Source.

“However, based on my observation, it appears that there’s a fortuitous encounter lying inside. If you send your juniors in, they might be able to benefit greatly from this. However, the formation inside hinges heavily on the harmony between yin and yang, so it would be best for the ones entering to be a male and a female. That’s the reason why I asked you that question earlier,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

“Grandmaster, will our juniors face any danger inside?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Rest assured. With me and my disciple around, she won’t be in any danger. She can just sit back and reap the rewards,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“I have a person in mind who is the most suited for this,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Is it Long Xiaoxiao?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“Ah... Well, Xiaoxiao does fulfill some of the requirements, but when it comes to mastery of world spiritist techniques, she’s still lacking a fair bit. I have another person in mind who is more suited for this than Xiaoxiao,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Oh? Who is it?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“It’s my other daughter, Long Mumu,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief replied.
