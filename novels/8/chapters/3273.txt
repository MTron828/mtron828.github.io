Chapter 3273 - Regained Honor

After Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys were expelled, the news of Chu Feng’s return to the Chu Heavenly Clan rapidly spread through the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.

Not only did the people of the younger generation rush over, but even the elders of the Chu Heavenly Clan rushed over to the palace, and were all outside the palace hall.

The palace hall was originally not a place that just anyone could enter. However, it was different at present. After all, Chu Feng’s return was a happy occasion.

After Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng discussed it with one another, they decided to permit everyone to enter the palace hall for the day.

Thus, the palace hall that was very imposing yet completely empty was soon packed with people and bustling with excitement.

Although everyone there knew who Chu Feng was, only a few among them had close relationships with him.

After all, the current Chu Feng was no longer the same Chu Feng from before.

Although everyone wanted to worm their way into being Chu Feng’s friend, they now felt reverence for Chu Feng, and found it difficult to approach him.

After all, they had all spoken ill of Chu Feng and treated him badly in the past.

Among the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, it would only be Chu Qing and the others that would dare to approach Chu Feng.

Speaking of it, it was quite a coincidence. Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang seemed to have come to a prior agreement and actually arrived at the palace hall at the same time.

The four of them were tortured by Linghu Ye’s cruel methods and forced to leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm of their own initiative.

When they left, the four of them were all seriously injured. However, their complexions at that moment were extremely good. It would appear that they had been completely cured of their injuries.

That said, although they looked to be in good health, their expressions were slightly unsightly. There was worry present on their faces.

When they saw Chu Feng, the four of them directly rushed over and surrounded him.

“Chu Feng, how did you return? Did the Linghu Heavenly Clan force you to return?”

“Little brother Chu Feng, are you alright?”

When Chu Qing and Chu Shuangshuang saw Chu Feng, the two of them became very concerned for his well-being.

After all, they were both forced to escape the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm by Linghu Mingye.

They were able to imagine what sort of circumstances Chu Feng encountered in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. They knew that things were extremely bad for him.

Thus, after they saw Chu Feng, they immediately felt that he must’ve been forced to escape the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm by the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

“I left of my own accord,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah?” Chu Qing and the others were feeling a bit confused,

Seeing their reactions, Chu Feng immediately added, “I was not driven out by the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.”

“If it’s not because of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, why did you leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?” Chu Haoyan and the others asked in unison. They were even more bewildered by Chu Feng’s answer.

“The Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is no longer under the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s control. Instead, it is under our Chu Heavenly Clan’s control,” Chu Feng said.

“The Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is under our Chu Heavenly Clan’s control now? What about the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen?” Chu Haoyan asked.

“All of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen left the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,” Chu Feng said.

“They left? Why?” Chu Shangshuang asked whilst blinking her large eyes.

“Little brother Chu Feng, what exactly is going on?” Chu Qing asked.

Not to mention the four of them, even Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng, grand existences in the Chu Heavenly Clan, were staring impatiently at Chu Feng and waiting for him to provide an answer.

After all, Chu Haoyan and the others had returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan for quite a bit of time.

Although they had not brought up Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys betraying their Chu Heavenly Clan, they had informed their Chu Heavenly Clansmen of all the major events that had happened in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

As such, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others all learned that the current overlord of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was the Linghu Heavenly Clan. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Furthermore, they learned that Chu Feng ended up rebelling against the despotic rule of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

That was also the reason why Chu Qing and the others were forced to escape the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm after being miserably tortured by Linghu Mingye.

After leaving the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang were all very worried for Chu Feng.

And now, after so much time had passed, Chu Feng had actually returned. Furthermore, he had returned with no injuries, and his mental state was also very good.

Furthermore, the words spoken by Chu Feng had let the crowd realize that a series of major events must’ve occurred in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

At that moment the crowd were all very interested in knowing exactly what had happened in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Faced with the crowd’s curious gazes, Chu Feng did not try to keep them in suspense, and began to tell them what had happened.

As they started to hear what had happened from Chu Feng, the expressions of the people present, regardless of whether they were from the older generation or the younger generation, began to change repeatedly.

At the beginning, they revealed amazement. Then, they were pleasantly surprised. After that, they became completely astonished. Finally, they were ecstatic.

Upon finding out that Chu Feng had not only driven the Linghu Heavenly Clan out of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, but also that Chu Feng had used the power of the grand formation to allow Chu Ping and the others to rule over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, to allow their Chu Heavenly Clan’s future descendants to continue to rule over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm after entering it, not only were the people of the younger generation cheering excitedly, but even the experts from the older generation were smiling gleefully.

The reason for that was because all of this was simply too unbelievable.

“Chu Feng, boy, you are truly amazing. Although both your father and your grandfather ruled the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm in the past, their rule only continued while they were in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

“Yet you, you actually managed to allow our clan to continue to rule over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm after you left. That is something that not even your grandfather and father were able to accomplish,” Chu Xuanzhengfa was very excited, and began to praise Chu Feng without holding back.

“My grandfather was the one who discovered that grand formation. My father was the one who assisted in the incubation of that grand formation. As for me, I have merely enjoyed the rewards of others’ hard work. I didn’t contribute anything at all. As such, how could I possibly compare to my grandfather and my father?” With a wry smile, Chu Feng shook his head.

Chu Feng was not being modest. Instead, that was truly what he felt.

“You don’t have to act so modest. Whilst it might sound easy, it is difficult to do. Even if that grand formation had truly matured, it is absolutely not something that just anyone could control,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Indeed, how could things in the cultivation world be so easily accomplished? Boy, you don’t have to be modest,” the other elders also began to echo Chu Xuanzhengfa with smiles on their faces.

Suddenly, Chu Haoyan said, “Chu Feng, you have been concealing your cultivation the entire time. It should be time for you to let us know what your current cultivation is, no?”

“That’s right. Chu Feng, you’re actually concealing your cultivation from even us, your seniors. That’s not right, no? Come, stop trying to be so secretive and let us see exactly how much you have grown now that you’ve gloriously returned from the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,” Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke with a joking tone.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was truly feeling happy today.

Although he didn’t witness it himself, he felt as if he were seeing Chu Xuanyuan from back then after hearing of what Chu Feng had done in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Chu Xuanzhengfa knew very well that a genius that would shake the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield had been born. As for that genius, he would once again carry the name of their Chu Heavenly Clan as he moved through the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

As for that genius, he was none other than Chu Feng.
