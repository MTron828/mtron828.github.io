Chapter 5782: Time to Conquer

“I agree to have Chu Feng enter alone too,” Jie Baobao said heartily.

“Me too,” Ling Xiao agreed.

“The two of you are not bad.” Long Chengyu shot a thumbs-up at Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao.

“I won’t let you down,” Chu Feng said before stepping into the spirit formation gate.

A number immediately appeared above the gate—1.

The spirit formation gate emanated a peculiar aurora that shimmered with an increasing tempo, as if counting down. The light shimmered with the highest intensity before abruptly stopping all at once. The number above the spirit formation gate vanished, and the gate turned corporeal.

Clearly, the others had lost their opportunity to enter the spirit formation gate.

An hourglass symbol appeared on the spirit formation gate, and sand was flowing from the hourglass. There were marks beside the hourglass too.

“What does that mean?” The crowd went up to take a closer look.

“There seems to be additional rewards. The faster one clears the trial, the greater the reward they are entitled to,” Ling Xiao said.

“The highest reward seems to be pretty formidable,” Little Fishy remarked as she reached out to touch the first golden rune beside the hourglass.

“Don’t touch it, little sister!”

Xianhai Shaoyu tried to stop her, but it was too late. Little Fishy had already touched the golden rune.

The golden rune was delicate and small, but as soon as Little Fishy touched it, it emitted a burst of golden light and expanded to over ten thousand meters in height. Then, it began to revolve till it morphed into a bundle of divine and imposing golden aura.

“This feeling!” Huangfu Shengyu’s eyes lit up upon seeing the golden rune.

“Young master, did you notice something?” Huangfu Jiangyao asked via voice transmission.

“It’s a formidable treasure. This Nine Heavens’ Zenith is indeed different from the previous iterations. I hope Chu Feng comes out soon,” Huangfu Shengyu said.

Huangfu Jiangyao and Huangfu Shangyang turned their attention to the divine golden rune, choosing not to probe any further. They understood Huangfu Shengyu’s personality—he would have elaborated more on his accord if he wanted to share.

“Big brother, that looks formidable. What is it?” Little Fishy asked excitedly.

“It’s bigger now, but I still can’t tell what it is. However, it looks like someone recognizes it.” Xianhai Shaoyu glanced at Huangfu Shengyu.

He had been paying attention to the surroundings, so he noticed Huangfu Shengyu’s earlier reaction too.

“Hey, do you know what that is?” Little Fishy asked.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It doesn’t matter whether I know or not. The key is whether your big brother is able to trigger it or not,” Huangfu Shengyu said.

The spirit formation gate suddenly turned back into an intangible formation, and Chu Feng walked out from within.

“You’ve already succeeded?”

The crowd’s lower jaws slackened in shock.

“I have,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“So fast?!”

The crowd was stunned. It was even faster than the shortest time allotted.

Boom!

The ancient hall suddenly began trembling, shaking even the purple aura enveloping their surroundings. It was as if they were expressing fear.

The crowd turned to the spirit formation gate, sensing that the cause of this phenomenon lay in there.

Boom!

All of a sudden, a surge of golden aura rushed out from the spirit formation gate and enveloped Chu Feng. The ancient hall trembled with even greater intensity.

“Big brother!!!”

Alarmed, Little Fishy rushed forward to drag Chu Feng out of the golden aura, but she was knocked back by the golden aura. She was unable to breach its encirclement and get to Chu Feng.

“Stay there, Little Fishy. I’m fine,” Chu Feng said aloud.

Even so, the crowd was worried as the golden aura was simply too terrifying. It was fortunate that this situation didn’t last long before the golden aura tore itself away from Chu Feng’s body.

The receding golden aura fused with the spirit formation gate and morphed into a light pillar that gushed upward, eventually forming a circular spirit formation gate. This spirit formation gate was transparent as if a huge window had been opened above the ancient hall. It allowed one to see what was happening outside the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

It was only then that the crowd saw that the entire Pulse Ignition Realm had been sealed off by a golden aura. It was a sight much more majestic than what they had witnessed so far.

“What’s that?”

The crowd was mesmerized by the golden aura. They noticed that the golden aura outside was the same one that had enveloped Chu Feng earlier, but they were shocked to learn that such a powerful energy existed in such a copious quantity.

All of a sudden, a person rushed toward the window-like spirit formation gate. It was Huangfu Shengyu!

Weng!

Golden patterns appeared on the spirit formation gate as soon as Huangfu Shengyu got close, and he was ricocheted back.

“Huangfu Shengyu, how shameless can you get? You want to beat us to it when you sat out on the earlier trial?” Long Chengyu sneered.

“The Ancient Era’s Heavenly Clan think highly of themselves, but their actions are nothing but despicable. I never knew the Ancient Era was so filthy,” Qin Xuan sneered.

Huangfu Jiangyao and Huangfu Shangyang rushed forward to support Huangfu Shengyu.

Huangfu Shengyu looked displeased, but he didn’t say a word. His eyes remained focused on the spirit formation gate.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng made his way toward the window-like spirit formation gate. The trial he just underwent had nothing to do with the Genesis Bloodline, so he was surprised to see the golden aura when he came out.

Perhaps due to him having absorbed energy related to the Genesis Bloodline in an earlier trial, he didn’t feel any pain when the Genesis Bloodline enveloped him. It was supposed to be an excruciating process to temper him and determine whether he was qualified.

In any case, he was able to clear the test with ease.

“Perhaps it’s time to conquer the Genesis Bloodline,” Chu Feng thought as he reached out to touch the spirit formation gate.

Weng!

Golden patterns appeared on the spirit formation gate too. They didn’t push Chu Feng away, but he was unable to enter the spirit formation gate either.

“Is there a secret in the patterns?”

Chu Feng earnestly examined the golden patterns that resembled golden butterflies in front of him, knowing that he had to decipher them in order to pass through the spirit formation gate and conquer the Genesis Bloodline.
