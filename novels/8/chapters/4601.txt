Chapter 4601: The Strongest Bloodline

“Them? Who are you referring to?”

Yin Tianchou frowned as he subconsciously took a step back. He was expecting Chu Feng to despair in this situation, and the way things were not going as he expected was starting to unravel his confidence.

“You’ll know soon enough.”

Right after saying those words, a noise that sounded even more deafening than the rumble of thunder echoed from Chu Feng’s body.

Boom!

Following that, flames began pouring out of Chu Feng’s body like an erupting volcano. These flames rose up high, reaching the sky. Be it in terms of scale or might, they were all far above that of Yin Tianchou’s!

Furthermore, there were five colors to his flames—white, gray, blue, purple, and gold!

These five different colored flames were like five ferocious beasts, and vaguely, one could hear growls and roars from them. They weren’t very distinct to the ear, but without a doubt, this was a quality that the flames summoned by Yin Tianchou’s bloodline ability didn’t possess.

If the number of colors of the flames manifested by the world spiritist bloodline was a gauge of strength, without a doubt, Chu Feng’s bloodline was several times stronger than that of Yin Tianchou.

“Damn it!”

Upon seeing the flames bursting out of Chu Feng, Yin Tianchou’s face began warping lividly.

As he said those words, a white flash of light suddenly burst out of his body.

It only lasted for an instant, but by the time the white light disappeared, Yin Tianchou was no longer anywhere to be seen.

“He escaped? He actually has such means?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Chu Feng clicked his tongue in annoyance, but without a doubt, Yin Tianchou had managed to make his getaway. As it turned out, Yin Tianchou still had other cards prepared too in case he lost the battle.

“Is this the bloodline granted to me by my mother?” Chu Feng wondered as he began inspecting his world spiritist bloodline.

Chu Feng had used his world spiritist bloodline on many occasions, be it to fend against venomous objects, control formations, or even to raise his own fighting prowess. It was also due to its power that he could fight against Yin Tianchou despite only having grasped rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation.

However, thanks to the powers of the Blood Dimension, he was able to see its physical manifestation for the first time.

It was as powerful as his Heavenly Bloodline, but it was extremely beautiful as well. The flames looked as radiant as the aurora, but it was much more captivating than that because it had five different colors. The glow coming from the five different colored flames were so magnificent that it shook one’s heart.

Chu Feng couldn’t help but feel moved on the inside. So, this was the great power that was lying inside of him.

Weng!

All of a sudden, the silver bowl above Chu Feng’s head began to contract. At the same time, the world spiritist bloodline Chu Feng had released began to dive back into his body.

Soon, the silver bowl returned back to its original size, and the surroundings reverted back to its original form.

“It’s truly a powerful treasure. It’s just a pity that it already has a master.”

Chu Feng grabbed hold of the silver bowl, wanting to sense its powers carefully. To his disappointment, the silver bowl rejected his discernment. Even though it was in Chu Feng’s hands, it wasn’t under his control.

It already had a master, and that person was most likely Yin Tianchou. It wouldn’t be an easy feat for Chu Feng to destroy the contract between the two of them together.

“Bloodline Dimension, huh? What a useful treasure this is.”

While Chu Feng was unable to control the silver bowl, he still appreciated it a lot. If he could gain possession of a treasure like this, if a day came where he had to deal with troublesome world spiritists like Yin Tianchou, it would be a powerful trump card that he could rely on.

It was, after all, the key behind why he managed to send Yin Tianchou running today.

Speaking of which, he should probably thank Yin Tianchou for this. He was still wondering how he could defeat Yin Tianchou, but who could have thought that the latter would court his own death?

Judging by the differences in their manifested world spiritist bloodline, had Yin Tianchou not escaped with his special means, he would have surely died without a doubt.

“I, Zhao Mingyue, thank the benefactor for saving my life!”

A voice suddenly sounded behind Chu Feng. The woman whom Chu Feng saved from Yin Tianchou’s clutches kneeled down behind Chu Feng.

She had put on the clothes Chu Feng had given her, and her injuries had recovered significantly after consuming a recovery pill though. Her complexion still looked horrible, but at least most of her wounds had vanished.

Zhao Mingyue was really a looker. She was not a top-class beauty, but she had a charming disposition.

To think that a person like her was actually done in by that beast, Yin Tianchou...

Chu Feng couldn’t help but feel sorry for her sake, but these feelings only lasted in his heart for an instant. Such things happened far too often in the world of cultivators that it would be almost meaningless to brood over it for too long.

Unless Chu Feng were to become the ruler of the entire world of cultivators, otherwise there was nothing he could do about this either.

“There’s no need to stand on ceremony. You should find a place to hide, don’t continue the test anymore,” Chu Feng said.

He felt that the woman should quickly leave this area so that she wouldn’t put herself deeper into danger.

“Benefactor, please wait a moment. May I ask for your name?” Zhao Mingyue asked.

“I only did it on a whim. You need not think too much into it.”

Chu Feng was intending to leave right away, but before he could even move, the woman had pounced forward and grabbed his leg tightly.

“Benefactor, it might have just been a whim for you, but to me, it was my life that you have saved. I know that I might never be able to return your kindness, but the least I should do is to learn the name of my benefactor!

“Please, I’m begging you!”

The woman’s eyes reddened as she spoke, and it looked like she was going to burst into tears soon.

Alright alright! My name is Chu Feng. Miss, you should let go of me. If you continue holding onto me, I’ll be eliminated in this trial. You’d then be returning kindness with ingratitude,” Chu Feng replied helplessly.

“Ah! My apologies, benefactor. I have acted inappropriately!” Zhao Mingyue exclaimed in shock before hurriedly releasing Chu Feng.

Chu Feng quickly left the area anxiously. He was not afraid of Yin Tianchou’s vengeance, but he was worried that he wouldn’t be able to gather all five keys on time and meet up with Song Yun.

Over half a day had passed, and it was likely that most of the formations had been breached by now. The keys left for Chu Feng’s picking were decreasing every single moment he wasted.

But all of sudden, Chu Feng’s face lit up in delight. He didn’t find any formation with keys, but he did find a large bunch of world spiritists gathered together.

He recognized some of these world spiritists. They were the ones who mocked Chu Feng prior to entering the Incubation Forest.

And more importantly, some of them had the five element keys hanging by their waist.

These people had chosen to gather and travel together with one another. Interestingly, they had a common topic that they appeared to be very into—putting down Chu Feng.

“The world sure is kind to me!”

The anxious look on Chu Feng’s face faded, giving way to a gleeful smile.
