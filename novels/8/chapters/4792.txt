“Zuoqiu Youyu, scram out here!”

The frenzied Xia Yan released her full prowess as a rank two Martial Exalted level, ravaging the surroundings with her aura. At the same time, she drew her weapon too.

It was a white jade sword that commanded an imposing presence. It was an Exalted Armament!

Both Xia Yan’s airs and might were indeed one to behold. It looked like she was ready to get into a huge fight with Zuoqiu Youyu.

“Xia Yan, stop slandering my brother! If you wish to accuse my brother of killing Chu Feng, bring out some evidence then. We’re currently in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, the most enigmatic place in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. It wouldn’t be surprising for anything to happen here. Those who have guts to come here ought to be ready to meet their end, so stop yapping away there!”

However, Zuoqiu Yanliang wasn’t intimidated by the furious Xia Yan. Instead, he began criticizing her angrily.

He looked sincerely angry, such that the crowd was left wondering if Xia Yan had really wronged Zuoqiu Youyu or not.

“Stop putting on an act there. Everyone knows about your grudge with Chu Feng. Since Zuoqiu Youyu dares not to come out, you’ll be the one to repay the debt then!”

Xia Yan pointed the Exalted Armament in her hand at Zuoqiu Yanliang.

“Hmph!

With a cold harrumph, Zuoqiu Yanliang released an even more powerful aura that immediately suppressed Xia Yan.

It was the oppressive might of a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator.

“You wish to kill me? Hah, know your place! Xia Yan, it’s on the account of your two grandfathers that I’ve been tolerating you thus far. Do you think that I’m really afraid of you?” Zuoqiu Yanliang sneered coldly.

Boom!

A red aura billowed ceaselessly into the sky, and Xia Yan’s aura immediately rose to rank three Martial Exalted level. At the same time, the red aura manifested into the form of a giant crimson wolf.

This crimson wolf spanned over tens of thousands of meters, covering the entire sky. As it slowly descended to the ground, Xia Yan’s aura rose once more to rank four Martial Exalted level.

“You actually mastered your Divine Powers to such a level?”

Zuoqiu Yanliang was astonished by what he was seeing. His eyes that were dripping with disdain a moment ago immediately turned grim.

While he had known that Xia Yan had achieved significant advancement in his Divine Powers, he didn’t think that she had already reached such a level. It was beyond his imagination that she would actually be able to use her Divine Powers to raise her cultivation level by two ranks despite only being at Martial Exalted level.

It was common knowledge that Zuoqiu Yanliang was a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator possessing a powerful Heavenly Bloodline. While he was still an Utmost Exalted level cultivator, he was able to summon both the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor.

However, his Heavenly Bloodline was limited upon reaching Martial Exalted level, such that he could only summon his Lightning Mark now.

So, even though Zuoqiu Yanliang was only a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator, he was only able to raise his cultivation rank by a single level to reach rank four Martial Exalted level. This meant that Xia Yan stood a chance against Zuoqiu Yanliang.

Weng!

All of a sudden, the space around Xia Yan distorted, and she disappeared without a trace.

Following Xia Yan’s disappearance, the space continued to distort, and Li Muzhi, Zhao Shi, Song Xi, Tu Yuanyuan, and the others also vanished as well.

The crowd was horrified by this development, wondering if some kind of calamity was upon them. However, there were no other victims after Zuoqiu Yanliang vanished as well. Slowly, the nervous hearts of the crowd calmed down a little.

In truth, Zuoqiu Yanliang was simply transported to another place by someone else. In this place were Xia Yan, Li Muzhi, Song Xi, Tu Yuanyuan, and the others who had vanished.

Of course, Zuoqiu Youyu was present too.

There was a Lightning Mark on his forehead, but it carried not a ‘Heavenly’ character but a ‘Divine’ character, similar to Chu Feng.

Zuoqiu Youyu had practiced the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique too!

On top of that, there was a Lightning Armor crackling around him too.

Due to that, his cultivation was raised two ranks all the way up to rank five Martial Exalted level even though his base cultivation was the same as Zuoqiu Yanliang.

This was also why Zuoqiu Youyu surpassed his older brother in terms of ranking and reputation despite the two of them being of the same cultivation rank. In terms of talent and strength, Zuoqiu Youyu was indeed the strongest junior in the present Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

Given that Xia Yan’s limit was only rank four Martial Exalted level, she was completely helpless before the rank five Martial Exalted level Zuoqiu Youyu, similar to Li Muzhi, Zhao Shi, Song Xi, Tu Yuanyuan, and the others.

All it took was an instant for Zuoqiu Youyu to bind them with his treasure.

“Zuoqiu Youyu, what did you do to Chu Feng?”

Despite being all tied up, Xia Yan still glared at Zuoqiu Youyu with murderous eyes.

However, the latter didn’t even bother sparing a glance at Xia Yan. Instead, he turned to Zuoqiu Yanliang and asked, “Big brother, do you feel any discomfort?”

“None at all. Youyu, why did you ask that? Could it be that Chu Feng managed to escape?’ Zuoqiu Yanliang asked in astonishment.

“I’m not certain, but there’s a good chance that he didn’t die in the earlier attack,” Zuoqiu Youyu replied..

“He was actually able to slip through your fingers?” Zuoqiu Yanliang was surprised.

“He must have some kind of escape means on him. However, the fact that he chose to escape instead of fighting with us shows that he’s weaker than us. If he’s truly alive, there’s no way he wouldn’t be able to figure out that I was the one who attacked him. Since you’re fine, it would mean that he was lying all this while and that he isn’t in control of the Hellking’s powers.

“He might have been able to kill those personal disciples, but he doesn’t have the means to dictate Song Qian and your life and death. So, you need not fear him anymore,” Zuoqiu Youyu said.

“That bastard! How dare he lie to me! If he’s still alive, I swear that I’ll end him with my own hands!” Zuoqiu Yanliang spat.

“Chu Feng seems to possess quite some means. It’ll be best for you to tread carefully if you encounter him. I’ll leave these people to you so that you can hold them hostage against Chu Feng.”

Naturally, Zuoqiu Youyu was referring to the bound Xia Yan and the others.

“Youyu, you should just end their lives right away. If they were to escape from this place...”

Zuoqiu Yanliang glanced at Xia Yan and the others worriedly.

“Big brother, what are you talking about? They have already met with their demise due to the earlier distortion of space. How could they possibly escape from this place?” Zuoqiu Youyu said.

Those words shocked not just Xia Yan and Li Muzhi but Zuoqiu Yanliang as well.

They didn’t think that Zuoqiu Youyu would really intend to take their lives!
