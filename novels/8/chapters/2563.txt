Chapter 2563 - Fighting For Love

“You will activate this spirit formation. Remember, you must concentrate fully,” Zi Xunyi said to Chu Feng.

“This Chu Feng does not dare to guarantee that he will definitely succeed. However, I will definitely do my best,” Chu Feng said with a serious expression.

Zi Xunyi looked to Chu Feng. She wanted to say something, but hesitated. Then, she wanted to turn to look at Ying Mingchao.

However, she didn’t do that. Instead, she turned around.

Seeing that, Ying Mingchao spoke to ask her, “Xunyi, where are you going? Are you still angry at me?”

Zi Xunyi stopped. However, she did not turn around. With her back facing Ying Mingchao, she said, “Forget about me.”

After saying those words, Zi Xunyi’s body moved, and she instantly disappeared.

At that moment, Ying Mingchao revealed a stunned expression. He was confused as to what was going on.

However, Chu Feng knew where Zi Xunyi had gone. He also knew what she was going to do.

Zi Xunyi deeply loved Ying Mingchao. However, it was also because of how much she loved Ying Mingchao that she felt extremely guilty toward the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.

That sort of guilt most definitely felt like a sharp blade that stabbed into her heart nonstop. It was something extremely unbearable.

This was especially true after she broke off all relations with the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, yet the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was still willing to brave dangers to save her.

She was truly moved by him. The guilt in her heart had completely burst forth. At that moment, she was feeling extremely pained in her heart.

She could not refuse to save Ying Mingchao. Yet, she also could not abandon the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Thus, Zi Xunyi had left to fight alongside the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.

Merely, it was difficult to tell whether they would survive the battle. After all, their opponents were the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clans. Furthermore, their opponents possessed their special Bloodline formation.

Ying Mingchao sighed. “That girl is truly headstrong. It’s alright, she will be fine once I amuse her after going out.”

“Hehe, Brother Chu Feng, it will all be up to you as to whether or not I will be able to go out,” he said to Chu Feng with a mischievous laugh.

Chu Feng was able to tell that Ying Mingchao had forced himself to laugh. After seeing Zi Xunyi, Ying Mingchao’s heart was also fluctuating enormously. It was fluctuating so strongly that he was unable to conceal his expression. The more he tried to conceal his emotions, the more loopholes there were.

That said, Ying Mingchao had no idea how dangerous the situation outside was. Thus, he only thought that Zi Xunyi was angry at him for what had happened back then.

However, he had no idea that Zi Xunyi might die after leaving, that it would be very possible for him to not see her again.

“Senior, after I activate this spirit formation, I will need your full cooperation,” Chu Feng said to Ying Mingchao.

“Rest assured boy, I know this formation. Go ahead, I know what I must do,” Ying Mingchao spoke very straightforwardly.

Seeing Ying Mingchao agreeing to it, Chu Feng hurriedly sat down and unleashed his spirit power. He began to wholeheartedly focus on activating that spirit formation.

“Buzz~~~”

At the moment the spirit formation was activated, a golden light appeared. Like a small palace, it completely covered Chu Feng and Ying Mingchao.

Time quickly passed. In the blink of an eye, ten hours passed.

After ten hours passed, the spheroid golden spirit formation finally dissipated.

At that moment, Chu Feng raised his head. He was finally able to see Ying Mingchao.

The man was over two meters tall. He had a very robust build.

Although he had a middle-aged man’s appearance, he had a head of long hair. His hair was truly long. Although he was only over two meters tall, his hair was over three meters in length.

Apart from his extremely long hair, he also had a full beard. His beard was also extremely long. Although his beard was not as long as his hair, it was over two meters long.

Fortunately, his lower half was covered by his black beard.

The reason for that was because Ying Mingchao was actually completely naked.

“I can move now, I can move now! It has been over a thousand years now! I, Ying Mingchao, have finally regained my liberty! Hahaha!!!”

At that moment, Ying Mingchao faced upwards and started laughing. He was truly excited.

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to sense Ying Mingchao’s aura. He was indeed a True Immortal. Not only that, but he was also a rank two True Immortal.

“Senior, please wear some clothes first. It is a bit indecent.”

Chu Feng took out a change of clothes from his Cosmos Sack and tossed them to Ying Mingchao.

“Haha, we’re both men, what’s there to fear? Rest assured, I am not interested in men.”

Ying Mingchao was laughing loudly. However, as he spoke, he had also changed into Chu Feng’s clothes.

“Senior, let’s leave right now,” Chu Feng stood up and said to Ying Mingchao.

“Little brother, this is all thanks to you this time around. I must properly thank you. Come... I have deliberately saved these two jugs of wine for today. Let us enjoy them.”

Ying Mingchao was overjoyed. He held the two jugs of wine in his hand and handed one to Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng had no heart to enjoy wine. Instead, with a serious expression on his face, he said to Ying Mingchao, “Senior, we must leave immediately. If we don’t leave right now, I’m afraid that Senior Zi Xunyi will be in danger.”

“Zi Xunyi... what’s going on with her? Why would she be in danger?” Hearing the name Zi Xunyi, Ying Mingchao’s expression changed immediately.

“At this moment, there are people from the Zhou Heavenly Clan in the Kong Heavenly Clan. We have forced our way in here.”

“Earlier, Senior Zi Xunyi must’ve left to confront them. As of now... we have no idea if she is still alive,” Chu Feng said.

“Damn it!” Hearing those words, Ying Mingchao immediately grabbed Chu Feng and started flying out with him.

Being shown the way by Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao successfully avoided the numerous slaughtering formations in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.

With the greatest speed, they exited the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.

It was no longer daytime outside.

Thick smoke was surging about in the Kong Heavenly Clan. Overflowing oppressive might covered the entire sky. The already dark night had become even more dusky.

However, it seemed that the battle had already ended.

The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was covered in blood. Countless of his scales had fallen off. Not only that, but his flesh was all torn, and his legs were missing. The condition of his injuries was truly astonishing to the heart and shocking to the eyes.

However, although those injuries of his could cause one’s heart to grieve upon seeing them, they remained only superficial wounds. To martial cultivators, they were nothing serious.

What cultivators feared the most was their source energy being injured, their souls being injured or their dantian being injured.

At that moment, the parts where the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief should not be injured the most were all damaged.

He was seriously injured, and simply unable to continue living. All that remained was his final breath.

At that moment, he had fallen into Zi Xunyi’s bosom.

However, he was reacting as if he could not feel the pain in his body. He had a blissful expression on his face, and was looking at Zi Xunyi with an incomparably gentle gaze.

As for Zi Xunyi, she too was seriously injured. However, she simply had no heart to care about her injuries and pain. Instead, she was looking at the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief in her bosom with tears falling like rain.

The reason for that was because she knew that the one who should be seriously injured was her. The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief had blocked an attack for her at the crucial moment.

He had saved her with his own life as the price.

“Don’t cry.”

The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief raised his hand with great difficulty. Using that violently trembling palm, he gently wiped away the tears on Zi Xunyi’s face.

Although he managed to wipe away her tears, bloodstains were left behind on Zi Xunyi’s face.

It was the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief’s blood.
