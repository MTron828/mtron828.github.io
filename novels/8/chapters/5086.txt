Chapter 5086: No One Can Save You

“Chu Feng, it seems like you can hold it in better than I thought. I’d like to see how long you can keep calm.”

Jiang Kongping kept his eyes firmly on Chu Feng. He knew how much his older brother cared for his pride, and that was also the reason why the latter accepted Chu Feng’s meaningless duel even when everyone from the Nine Souls Galaxy present was doomed to die.

Jiang Yuantai simply wanted to prove his strength.

However, the situation wasn’t going according to Jiang Yuantai’s plans. Thus, Jiang Kongping wanted to find a way to prove that his older brother didn’t lose so as to make his older brother feel a little better.

“Hold it in? I didn’t know that it was possible to hold in the backlash of forbidden medicine. You sure think of me as an incredible person!”

Chu Feng reached into his Cosmos Sack and took out a wooden container. He opened it up and showed it to Jiang Kongping.

“Take a good look, Jiang Kongping. Did I eat any of the three forbidden medicines you have?”

There were three pills in the wooden container, and that was all Jiang Kongping had in his Cosmos Sack.

“Impossible!”

Jiang Kongping was baffled to see the three pills. He was certain that Chu Feng had eaten the forbidden medicine, but the situation was telling him otherwise.

If Chu Feng had really consumed the forbidden medicine, he would have definitely suffered a backlash by now.

Jiang Taibai and the others also swiftly understood what was going on. It was finally apparent to them that Chu Feng hadn’t consumed any of the forbidden medicine. He had defeated Jiang Yuantai with his own strength even when the latter had consumed a forbidden medicine.

But how in the world did Chu Feng become this powerful?

“How did you do it?” Jiang Yuantai finally spoke up after a long bout of silence.

He wanted to know how Chu Feng had won in this battle.

Shoosh shoosh!

Chu Feng brandished the sword in his hand.

“The fighting prowess you have displayed is a result of the spearmanship you have practiced; you should be clearer of that than anyone else. That day, under the pressure of your spearmanship, I comprehended a sword skill of my own. It’s just that I didn’t have time to fully develop it.

“However, over the last few days, I was able to fully master the sword skill. That’s also the reason why you aren’t a match for me anymore. I’m also glad that you have only consumed a forbidden medicine, or else the most I could have done was to force the match to a draw,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“It was the sword skill he grasped that day? He managed to develop it into such a formidable sword skill within such a short span of time?”

The cultivators from the Nine Souls Galaxy were shocked to hear those words. It sounded utterly ridiculous to them. In fact, even the Lady of Dao Sea and the others found it incredulous too.

“Hahaha!”

Jiang Yuantai suddenly burst into laughter. It had started out soft, but it swiftly crescendoed with an eerie undertone to it. Those listening to it felt a chill run down their spine.

“You’re truly a prodigy, Chu Feng. It’s no wonder my younger brother would lose to you. It’s just a pity that you’re dumber than a rock. If you had laid low, you might have just posed a threat to us many years from now. Yet, you foolishly chose to appear here for your so-called loyalty toward your friends. Do you even understand the situation you’re in?

“Very well. Since you have chosen to come here on your own accord, it’d be rude of me to not reciprocate!” Jiang Yuantai said.

He revealed his murderous intent and released the suppression on his cultivation, causing it to recover back to rank eight Martial Exalted level. Clearly, he had already accepted his defeat and didn’t want to put on an act any longer.

He had decided to get rid of Chu Feng.

“Are you intending to go against our promise?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.

“Hahahahaha! How dumb must you be to ask the obvious? Did you really think that I would spare you if you defeated me? Well, if you begged me desperately after falling in defeat, I might have considered sparing you. But how could I allow someone who possesses as much talent as you to escape?”

Jiang Yuantai looked at Chu Feng as if he was a fool.

“I never thought that you would let me off. I just wanted to see how ugly you can get. It was right. You’re indeed a scum. Alright, I’m already done verifying whatever I want to. Let’s not waste any time and get along with it.”

Chu Feng nonchalantly shrugged with a smile on his lips, as if he had already accepted his death. His gesture looked incredibly provocative to Jiang Yuantai.

“Is Chu Feng out of his mind?!”

No one in the crowd could understand what Chu Feng was up to, even the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. They thought that Chu Feng was here to save his master and friends, but that didn’t look to be the case now. If Chu Feng had known that the Pill Dao Immortal Sect wouldn’t honor their promise, why did he even return here and challenge Jiang Yuantai to a duel?

It was no different from committing suicide!

“You dare to provoke me at a time like this? Do you want to die that much?” Jiang Yuantai spat through gritted teeth.

“Heh…”

Chu Feng’s smile widened, making no attempt to conceal the disdain he carried for Jiang Yuantai.

“Fine! I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Shoosh!

Jiang Yuantai thrust his palm toward Chu Feng’s neck with a speed so fast that he tore a hole through the fabric of space.

Pu!

Blood splattered all around, and the crowd fell silent yet again.

“!!!”

Even Jiang Taibai was in a state of disbelief after seeing what had happened.

Not only did Chu Feng dodge Jiang Yuantai’s attack, but he had also used his sword to pierce Jiang Yuantai’s left arm. One must know that Jiang Yuantai’s cultivation was not at rank eight Martial Exalted level right now but rank nine Martial Exalted level. He had raised his cultivation by a single rank using his bloodline power.

Under normal circumstances, it should have been impossible for Chu Feng to even injure Jiang Yuantai. Yet, Chu Feng managed to do it, for he was also emanating the aura of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator too!

“Chu Feng… did he manage to raise his cultivation level? But that’s impossible! Isn’t he at rank four Martial Exalted level? How could he raise his cultivation to rank eight Martial Exalted level within such a short period of time?!”

Everyone was astounded.

Chu Feng’s current cultivation level was at rank nine Martial Exalted level, but Wang Yuxian and the others keenly noticed the Lightning Mark on his forehead, which told them that he had raised his cultivation by a rank too.

But they also knew that the Lightning Mark could only raise his cultivation by a single rank, which meant that Chu Feng’s real cultivation level had reached rank eight Martial Exalted level! That meant that he was at the same level as Jiang Yuantai.

It was inconceivable to them how someone who was only at rank four Martial Exalted level could advance his cultivation by four ranks within such a short period of time, reaching rank eight Martial Exalted level.

Grar!

Jiang Yuantai let out a howl of defiance! A peculiar aura began seeping out of his body, granting him an additional level of Heaven-defying Battle Power.

Shoosh!

In response, Chu Feng swung his sword and easily severed Jiang Yuantai’s arm. It turned out that he had manifested the Lightning Armor too, resulting in him gaining an additional level of Heaven-defying Battle Power too.

Given the same cultivation level, Jiang Yuantai wasn’t a match for Chu Feng at all.

“Is that all you have? Since you were the one who first reneged on your promise, you shouldn’t blame me for not showing mercy!” Chu Feng sneered.

He raised his sword up high, ready to take down Jiang Yuantai.

“Audacious!” a bellow suddenly sounded.

The earth shook and the sky tremored. A powerful oppressive might crushed down on Chu Feng.

Those from the Nine Souls Galaxy immediately knew that the situation had gone awry. The oppressive might had come from a Half-God level cultivator, and it was filled with killing intent.

It was from Jiang Taibai.

He was intending to take Chu Feng’s life and end this farce. He had only held himself back because he knew that Jiang Yuantai would berate him for interfering in his affairs, but it was clear at this point that Jiang Yuantai wasn’t a match for Chu Feng.

Given so, there was no way Jiang Taibai would allow Chu Feng to do as he pleased.

Boom!

Just as the oppressive might was about to reach Chu Feng, another loud explosion broke out. Following that, the surrounding space shook intensely. It was to the extent that even the gigantic Immortal Cauldron started to sway.

Many of the cultivators let out a pained groan under the impact, and the weaker ones even exploded into bits of flesh and blood.

Jiang Taibai’s face paled. He knew very well what had just happened. His oppressive might had been deflected!

“What’s going on?”

The crowd swiftly noticed that something had happened, as shown by how Chu Feng was still alive. It seemed like someone had deflected Jiang Taibai’s attack.

But who could it be?

Did Chu Feng bring in a helper?

That was what the Lady of Dao Sea, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others were wondering. That was the only possibility in their minds.

“Why don’t you show yourself!” Jiang Taibai bellowed as he scanned the surroundings.

He also thought that Chu Feng must have brought in a powerful cultivator, and the powerful cultivator was the one who deflected his earlier attack.

“Heh…”

Chu Feng suddenly sneered at this moment. He raised his sword and impaled Jiang Yuantai’s neck.

“You bastard!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Seeing that Chu Feng actually dared to hurt Jiang Yuantai, Jiang Taibai raised his hand and manifested a humongous ten-thousand meters large golden palm that swiftly fell upon Chu Feng.

Boom!

But the golden palm made out of martial power crumbled as soon as it came close to Chu Feng.

“That is!!!”

Jiang Taibai’s eyes widened in horror. He saw a layer of black gaseous flame appearing around Chu Feng. It was the black gaseous flame that had deflected his golden palm.

The black gaseous flame gave off a sinister aura that left him feeling incredibly unnerved.

Boom!

The black gaseous flame began to expand, swiftly forming a humongous sphere that spanned a diameter of over tens of thousands of meters. It sealed off the surroundings as if a black formation, completely isolating Chu Feng and Jiang Yuantai from the rest of the world.

Fear showed in Jiang Yuantai’s eyes for the first time.

Chu Feng looked at him and sneered, “Unless I choose to spare you, no one can save you today.”
