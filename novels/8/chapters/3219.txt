Chapter 3219 - Inside The Formation Of Light

“Linghu Mingye, the fifth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars; he really entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?!”

The expressions of the people from the various powers on the plaza all changed upon seeing Linghu Mingye.

This was especially true for Dongguo Bingyu. Deep worry appeared in her eyes.

The reason for that was because Linghu Mingye was even stronger than Linghu Lun. Everyone present was able to sense that Linghu Mingye was a rank two Martial Immortal.

Although Dongguo Bingyu was also a rank two Martial Immortal, she was over two hundred years older than Linghu Mingye.

Perhaps two hundred years was not a very long time for ordinary martial cultivators; after all, they would need to train for a long time in order to make progress due to their limited talent. However, to the geniuses present, two hundred years was an extremely long period of time.

Linghu Mingye was able to reach the Martial Immortal realm before he turned a hundred. In that case, once he reached Dongguo Bingyu’s age, one could very well imagine what sort of cultivation he would obtain.

While it might not be possible for him to become an Exalted-level expert within two hundred years, Linghu Mingye was practically certain to become a renowned Martial Immortal-level expert within two hundred years.

Someone like Linghu Mingye was truly a genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Most importantly, a genius like him had only just entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, and was still a newcomer.

In other words, Linghu Mingye could enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

Although Chu Feng and the others had most likely successfully entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, they had offended the Linghu Heavenly Clan in the process.

After the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s newcomers entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, they would definitely not spare them.

To Dongguo Bingyu and the others, Linghu Mingye’s appearance was extremely bad news.

“Mingye, you’ve come at the perfect timing. Quickly, enter the Formation of Light and properly teach that Chu Feng a lesson.”

Sure enough, upon seeing Linghu Mingye, Linghu Tiemian immediately ordered him to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. Before everyone present, Linghu Tiemian told Linghu Mingye to take care of Chu Feng and the others.

“I’ve already said that I’m not interested in that Formation of Light,” Linghu Mingye said.

“Mingye, I can understand that you are not interested in the Formation of Light from earlier.”

“However, this Formation of Light is no longer an ordinary Formation of Light. Instead, it is the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. The amount of cultivation resources contained in this Holy Spirit Formation of Light is over several times that of the ordinary Formation of Light.”

“A training ground like the Holy Spirit Formation of Light is very rare throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. You must not miss out on this opportunity,” Linghu Tiemian earnestly advised Linghu Mingye.

“I know that this Holy Spirit Formation of Light is very remarkable. I’ve heard the conversations between you all earlier. However, as I’ve said before, I’m not interested in the Formation of Light. That serves true for both the ordinary Formation of Light and this so-called Holy Spirit Formation of Light,” Linghu Mingye said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Linghu MIngye’s words not only surprised Linghu Tiemian and the other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, but they also surprised all the others present.

“To be uninterested in even the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, that Linghu Mingye is simply too arrogant, no?

“Mingye, do not be so stubborn,” Linghu Tiemian’s attitude had changed somewhat. From his previous earnest advice earlier, his words now contained a trace of anger.

“I said I’m not entering it, so I will definitely not enter it. Besides, it’s only to take care of a bunch of trash. There’s simply no need for me to handle it. A’Lun will be able to take care of them,” Linghu Mingye looked to Linghu Lun, “A’Lun, you shouldn’t have a problem with it, right?”

“Of course not. Merely, Mingye, what big brother Tiemian said is very correct. This Holy Spirit Formation of Light is truly a very rare cultivation opportunity. Are you really planning to miss out on it like that?” Linghu Lun asked.

“Indeed, this opportunity is rare. However, no matter how rare the opportunity might be, it still contains limited cultivation resources. As such, I will not fight over them with you.”

“A’Lun, make sure to seize this opportunity and strive to become a rank two Martial Immortal quickly,” Linghu Mingye said to Linghu Lun with a smile on his face.

At that moment, the crowd finally realized why Linghu Mingye was determined not to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

It turned out that it was not purely because of his stubbornness. Instead, he was deliberately giving the opportunity to Linghu Lun so that Linghu Lun would be able to gain even greater benefits in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

At that moment, Linghu Tiemian, who had become angry at Linghu Mingye, was at a loss for words.

Linghu Mingye’s action was a sign of brotherly affection, something that was extremely rare to come by in the current cultivation world.

When others were moved by Linghu Mingye’s action, Linghu Lun would naturally also be moved.

At that moment, Linghu Lun had an extremely moved expression. In fact, there were even glistening teardrops in his eyes.

However, Linghu Lun did not cry from being moved. Instead, he suddenly laughed and said to Linghu Mingye, “Mingye, I will definitely not disappoint you.”

“Let us go.”

After he finished saying those words, Linghu Lun’s body shifted, and he flew into the entrance to the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

Seeing that, the other newcomers from the Linghu Heavenly Clan and the newcomers from the Nightmare Spirit Clan and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan also set off toward the spirit formation entrance.

Meanwhile, as the newcomers from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the Nightmare Spirit Clan and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan entered the spirit formation entrance, Chu Feng and the others had already entered the so-called Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

The Holy Spirit Formation of Light was an extremely vast spirit formation world.

There were countless mountains, plains and rivers. In fact, there were even several vast oceans that extended as far as the eye could see.

From this, one could imagine how vast the world was.

Of course, for people with cultivations like those that Chu Feng and the others possessed, only in a world of such vastness would they be able to travel about freely. Otherwise, with their speed, they would soon travel through and search every nook and cranny of the world like they had done in the New Excellence Formation.

Should that happen, it would instead make things boring.

Only by having a world so vast would they have a sense of anticipation.

“This place is truly vast. However, this is good too, as it will decrease our chances of encountering the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen,” Someone said.

“So what if we are to encounter them? Didn’t that Linghu Heavenly Clansman say that as long as we entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, they would allow us to train here? Are they perhaps going to target us here? Should that happen, wouldn’t they have gone back on their word? Wouldn’t they be slapping themselves in the face?” A young and inexperienced-looking woman said.

“Don’t be naive,” Li Anzhi immediately said after that woman’s words left her mouth.

“Why do you say that? Are you saying that the Linghu Heavenly Clan will really go back on their word to not deliberately make things difficult for us?” At that moment, many people began to question Li Anzhi. Worried expressions filled their faces.

After all, being inside the same Holy Spirit Formation of Light, even if the probability was very slim, it was still possible for them to encounter people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

If the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were truly planning to make things difficult for them, it would be better for them to not have entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.
