Chapter 4826: Surprisingly Maddening

“I told you that you shouldn’t have gotten back up. You should have feigned death to the very end,” Chu Feng snorted.

“Is it the power of forbidden medicine? Even if you used a forbidden medicine, you’d only be able to rival me in strength. You still wouldn’t be a match for me!”

Zuoqiu Youyu’s eyes gleamed in viciousness.

Shoosh!

He swiftly swung the Exalted Armament in his hand, and it formed countless after images that looked like an army of thousands completely encircling Chu Feng, seeking to tear him into pieces.

However, Chu Feng didn’t panic in the face of this battle. He stood gracefully on the spot as he began swinging his Immemorial Hero’s Sword in retaliation. His movement looked slow and gentle, but it was nothing more than an illusion. In truth, he was moving at a speed so fast that he actually blocked off all of Zuoqiu Youyu’s attacks.

“Brother Chu is indeed formidable.”

Duan Liufeng smiled in delight as he murmured compliments for Chu Feng.

He knew that Zuoqiu Youyu wasn’t just for show. The latter had become the second place of the Hidden Dragon Disciples through his true capabilities. He dared not say for the whole world of cultivation, but at least in the scope of the Holy Light Galaxy, Zuoqiu Youyu definitely ranked amidst the top of the juniors.

Be it in terms of cultivation, intelligence, combat power, or ability to utilize martial skills, none of his peers could rival him at all.

However, what Zuoqiu Youyu particularly excelled in was actually swordsmanship. He was interested in swordsmanship and had been training in it from a young age. On top of that, he had his grandfather, one of the top experts of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, to guide him along the way. Due to that, he was able to achieve considerable attainment in terms of swordsmanship despite his young age.

Even without resorting to any martial skill, his swordsmanship was already a huge threat to deal with. If he claimed to be second in terms of swordsmanship amongst the juniors, no one would dare proclaim himself first.

Yet, Chu Feng was actually able to stand toe to toe with Chu Feng in a fight of swordsmanship!

Not to mention, Chu Feng was still in a severely weakened state from having executed the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes, so in terms of martial power, Chu Feng should be weaker than Zuoqiu Youyu at the moment.

One had to know that martial power was of utmost importance to a cultivator. For two cultivators of the same level, the difference in martial power could easily determine victory and loss.

In other words, it was safe to say that Chu Feng’s swordsmanship skill was actually above that of Zuoqiu Youyu, which was why he was able to fight Zuoqiu Youyu on equal grounds despite being slightly weaker at the moment.

If Chu Feng had been in his peak condition, Zuoqiu Youyu would have likely fallen into defeat quickly, at least in terms of swordsmanship.

This was the reason why Duan Liufeng was overjoyed. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Zuoqiu Youyu, your swordsmanship looks pretty decent. You must have gotten the guidance of an expert. But how unfortunate it is that you met me. I’ve never lost to anyone in a clash of weapons before!” Chu Feng sneered.

“You have never lost before? Haha, what arrogant words! Are you saying that I’ve lost to anyone before? One of us will be falling in defeat here today, but that person is definitely you!”

Zuoqiu Youyu’s swordsmanship grew even more ferocious. He tore through the trees around them with just his sword rays, forcefully creating a clearing in the middle of the mountain forest they were in.

What was worth noting was that the severed parts had been reduced in dust due to the absurd speed of his swordsmanship, such that not even a single leaf remained intact.

Zuoqiu Youyu was indubitably a formidable opponent. His swordsmanship was vigorous and forceful, making it hard for Chu Feng to deal with in his injured state. At least in terms of strength, Zuoqiu Youyu definitely had the advantage here.

Chu Feng was forced to retreat again and again, but he showed no panic at all. He continued eyeing Zuoqiu Youyu intently with a smile sitting on his lips. His expression looked almost as if he was toying with Zuoqiu Youyu here.

“Is this all you have? You actually think that you can win against me with such lowly skills? How disappointing. If you have anything else up your sleeves, hurry up and bring it out,” Chu Feng sneered.

“What big words for someone who is struggling against my onslaught at the moment!” Zuoqiu Youyu bellowed furiously.

Chu Feng’s provocation had successfully triggered him.

He couldn’t stand how Chu Feng was mocking him even though he was in an advantageous position here. It was not that he didn’t try to mock Chu Feng back, but the latter was somehow completely unfazed by his remark. It was as if Chu Feng had already decided that he was weaker than him, and nothing could change his mind.

This infuriated him further.

It was just like two people spitting at one another, but one party was somehow able to dodge all of the spits.

Anyone in his place would be maddened and disgusted.

“Struggling? I haven’t even gotten serious yet! Take a close look around you. You have been fighting so vigorously, destroying the surroundings. Yet, did you even manage to get a nick on me?” Chu Feng said with a contemptuous smile.

Zuoqiu Youyu was so enraged by his attitude that even his veins were starting to pop out.

“Who could have thought that that fellow would have such a sharp mouth?”

Even Duan Liufeng was surprised by Chu Feng’s taunts.

It was common for taunts to occur in a fight, but even combat veterans like Duan Liufeng were reluctant to fight against opponents like Chu Feng.

There was nothing more frustrating than fighting against an opponent who kept striking one’s sore spots, and yet, one was unable to do anything back to him.

More often than not, psychological attacks were much more unbearable than physical attacks.

There were cases of cultivators who had been angered to death in this world.

Duan Liufeng was glad that he was only watching by the sidelines right now. Had he been in Zuoqiu Youyu’s place, he might have been pulled into Chu Feng’s tempo too.
