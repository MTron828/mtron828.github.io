Chapter 4037 - The Change To The Chu Heavenly Clan

“Milord, if it weren’t for you, we Underground Iron Beasts would have definitely all been wiped out.”

“Thus, Milord, if you ever need our assistance in the future, do not hesitate to tell us. If it’s something that we Underground Iron Beasts can do, we will definitely spare no effort,” the old beast said with a clasped fist.

“You all intend to continue living here?”

Chu Feng was able to tell from the words spoken by the old beast that the Underground Iron Beasts intended to continue living in that place.

“Lord Benefactor, we Underground Iron Beasts have existed in this place since our birth. We also have instructions from our ancestors that we must never leave this place,” said the old beast.

“In that case, does anyone else beside Tuoba Chengan know that you all live here?” asked Chu Feng.

“There shouldn’t be anyone else. Our clan has always been careful, and would practically never interact with the outside world.”

“Actually, our clan shouldn’t have suffered this calamity. It was this old man’s kind-heartedness that led to this disaster.”

As he said those words, the old beast had a look of regret.

Chu Feng later learned from the old beast the reason why Tuoba Chengan knew of their existence.

It turned out that Tuoba Chengan had once been seriously injured, and had just so happened to land outside the mountain range.

Although the Underground Iron Beasts were very fierce in appearance, they were actually kind-hearted creatures.

They were a clan of good and honest monstrous beasts.

Seeing the dying Tuoba Chengan, the old beast felt compassion, and decided to bring him into their clan to heal him.

Originally, he had planned to bring Tuoba Chengan away once his injuries stabilized and before he regained consciousness so as to avoid future troubles.

However, Tuoba Chengan had actually woken up all of a sudden. Furthermore, to the old man’s surprise, Tuoba Chengan was extremely powerful, much more powerful than him.

What happened later on was naturally Tuoba Chengan not being grateful for being saved by the old man, but instead beginning to covet the treasures of the underground cave.

Because of that, the entire Underground Iron Beast Clan had been reduced to mere slaves by Tuoba Chengan.

They had been tortured and sadistically killed by him.

Upon hearing about this course of events, Chu Feng’s heart raged with anger.

He’d already known that Tuoba Chengan had an extremely vile personality. However, he had never imagined that he would be malicious enough to not even spare the people that had saved his life.

If Chu Feng had known all this before, he wouldn’t have allowed Tuoba Chengan to die so easily.

However, there was at least one bit of good news -- apart from Tuoba Chengan, it seemed like no one else knew of the underground cave’s existence.

If the Underground Iron Beasts decided to continue to live there, they would most likely remain undisturbed.

However, to guard against the unexpected, Chu Feng set up a powerful spirit formation before leaving.

That spirit formation not only made the cave even more hidden, it also made it extremely difficult for outsiders to enter.

It could be said that Chu Feng had given the Underground Iron Beasts a safety guarantee.

After that, Chu Feng refined the gift the Underground Iron Beasts had given him.

The power was as Chu Feng had expected. Not only was it able to enter his soul, but it was also able to protect and strengthen his dantian.

It was a very rare tempering treasure.

Thinking back to how Tuoba Chengan was able to recover the cultivation he had lost after being crippled by the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master. And how he had obtained much more of the power than Tuoba Chengan had, Chu Feng had not only eliminated Tuoba Chengan during his visit to the All-heaven Starfield, he’d even received an unexpected harvest.

This trip could be said to have been made worthwhile.

With that, Chu Feng departed from the underground cave and began proceeding for the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Although he had only been in the All-heaven Starfield for a short amount of time, he was constantly worried about the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Of course, he was mostly worried about the people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

......

Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Chu Heavenly Clan.

Ever since being entrusted with control of the Ancestral Martial Starfield by the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s city master after the battle against the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Heavenly Clan hadn’t had a single day of peace.

Powers from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield kept coming to the Chu Heavenly Clan to pay them visits and offer words of congratulations. In fact, there were even powers from other starfields that visited the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The bustling activity was something that had never occurred in the Chu Heavenly Clan in all the years of their history.

Actually, had it been other powers, they would most likely not have attended to all the guests.

After all, as the overlord of a starfield, one should possess a demeanor befitting of an overlord.

However, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not refuse anyone.

Regardless of whether the powers that visited were strong or weak, he would receive them as long as it was their first time paying the Chu Heavenly Clan a visit.

Of course, all the powers that came to visit the Chu Heavenly Clan were very respectful.

Although the Chu Heavenly Clan had been bustling with activity, they were basked in countless people’s reverence and adoration at the same time.

Because of that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were extremely pleased with themselves.

Even though they were originally the overlords of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm to begin with, and had always been respected by all the powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, it was limited to only the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

They all knew that if they were to leave the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, their Chu Heavenly Clan’s status was actually very low in the standings of the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

There were a lot of people that looked down on them.

However, things had changed. All the powers in the Ancestral Martial Starfield were extremely respectful towards them.

Their statuses had increased by who-knew-how many levels.

This transformation caused the vanity in their hearts to increase significantly. Naturally, they were extremely fond of the change in their identities, and the respect and reverence they received from the various other powers.

That said, as the people of the younger generation did not consider a lot of things, it was understandable that they got immersed in the delight brought forth by their change in status.

However, it was different for those of the older generation. They were slightly worried.

They all knew that the foundations of their Chu Heavenly Clan could not support the status of a starfield’s overlord.

The only reason they were able to gain their current status was all due to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s supporting Chu Feng.

Because of that, they all knew that they were nothing more than overlords in name.

People would always seek higher elevation, whereas water would flow to a lower elevation.

Since they’d obtained this status, even if it was nothing more than nominal, they still did not wish to surrender it. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They wanted to enjoy the feeling of being revered by the entire starfield.

Because of that, the topic of how to keep their overlord status became the main consideration.

Of course, they knew that their greatest trump card was Chu Feng.

Chu Feng possessed astonishing talent. His talent was not at all inferior to his grandfather and father Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan.

All the Chu Heavenly Clansmen knew that as long as Chu Feng was given a sufficient amount of time, he would definitely become the most powerful being in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. At that time, no one would dare question the authority of their Chu Heavenly Clan.

However... what were they to do before then?

The period before Chu Feng matured was precisely what they were worried about.

......

At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and many elders of the Chu Heavenly Clan were all gathered outside a teleportation formation.

They stood in an orderly manner. It was a rarely-seen sight.

Apart from the people of the Three Cities, practically no one could cause the Chu Heavenly Clan to muster such a large display of force.

It turned out, they were sending off someone respectfully.

However, that person was not someone from the Three Cities.

He was an old man. With an impressive appearance, he wore a purple-gold gown. Ignoring his overwhelming aura, merely his outfit itself was enough to make him look extremely noble.

Seeing him, one would feel like he was someone that should not be trifled with.

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen all faced that old man with smiles on their faces.

Their respectful attitude further illustrated how extraordinary the old man was.

However, the moment the old man disappeared into the teleportation formation, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s elders immediately stopped smiling. Their rigid smiles were replaced with frowns.

Even Chu Hanpeng and Chu Xuanzhengfa frowned.
