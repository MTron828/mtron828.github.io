MGA: Chapter 1585 - The Strongest of the Younger Generation

“You, listen carefully. Brother Chu Feng is my brother. If you dare to say another disrespectful remark about him, do not blame me, Nangong Ya, for being impolite,” After Nangong Ya finished saying those words, Nangong Ya retrieved his spear.

“You... you... good... Nangong Ya, what courage you have. As this place is the Immortal Island, I will show my respect toward Weaponry Refinement Immortal, and not lower myself to argue with you. However, after we leave Immortal Island, I will definitely teach you a lesson.”

To have his throat pointed at and nearly pierced into by Nangong Ya’s spear before this many people caused Beitang Zimo to feel extremely humiliated. He was so angry that he started to gnash his teeth. Beitang Zimo was a person who held grudges. This hatred was deeply remembered by him.

“Everyone, I’ve made you all wait.”

Right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded. Soon, a group of white clothed people wearing conical bamboo hats arrived from the other end of the plaza.

There were a total of twenty people, with ten on either side. Their appearances could not be determined. However, their cultivations could be felt. All twenty of them were peak Half Martial Emperors, existences at the same level as the Nine Powers’ headmasters.

However, these extraordinary existences were standing to either side like a group of guards. It was as if they were waiting for someone.

Sure enough, a young man soon walked over following the twenty experts. He then stood at their forefront.

Then, those twenty experts began to follow behind that young man like a group of guards.

This young man was also wearing white clothes. His age was on par with Nangong Ya and Beitang Zimo’s. However, his cultivation was actually even stronger than theirs. Even though they were all from the younger generation, this young man’s cultivation was actually rank five Half Martial Emperor.

It was not only that. His battle power was also extremely strong. Like Chu Feng and Tantai Xue, he possessed heaven-defying battle power that could surmount three levels of cultivation. In other words, this young man’s actual battle power was on par with ordinary rank eight Half Martial Emperors.

Someone of the younger generation who could contend against rank eight Half Martial Emperors, this young man was the strongest member of the younger generation Chu Feng had ever seen since his arrival in the Holy Land of Martialism.

Furthermore, Chu Feng discovered that this white-clothed young man, other than possessing an extremely powerful cultivation, also emitted a special sort of aura. He was emitting a faint golden light.

While that golden light was something that ordinary people would not be able to see, Chu Feng was capable of seeing it. It was world spirit power, the spirit power of a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. This white-clothed young man was not only a martial cultivation genius, he was also a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.

This sort of talent was truly frightening.

“Who is that man? He’s so powerful,” At this moment, even Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, and began to inquire. That was because this young man’s talent in all aspects could not be looked down upon. It could be said that he was the strongest of the younger generation. At the very least, he was the strongest among all of the others of the younger generation that Chu Feng had encountered.

“I’ve also never seen that man before. However, if my guess is correct, he should be Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s personal disciple, Baili Xinghe,” Nangong Ya said. [1. Baili Xinghe → Surname Baili (hundred miles, actual surname) and given name Xinghe → star river → galaxy.]

“Baili Xinghe?” Chu Feng remembered this name. This Baili Xinghe was qualified for Chu Feng to remember his name.

“Mn, Baili Xinghe is a Divine Body. Reportedly, he controls a Divine Power like the galaxy. Among all Divine Powers, he is one of the strongest. There are even people who say that he has the strongest Divine Body in the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“Look carefully at Baili Xinghe’s eyes. His eyes seem like they contain the galaxy. They’re extremely extraordinary,” Nangong Ya said as he pointed at Baili Xinghe.

“Indeed. Not only do his eyes seem to contain the galaxy, his entire aura is extremely extraordinary. From merely a glance, one can tell that he’s a dragon among men. The Overlord Domain is truly a place with hidden dragons and crouching tigers.”

Rarely had Chu Feng ever given this sort of evaluation of someone of his same generation. However, this Baili Xinghe was really extremely outstanding. Chu Feng couldn’t help but give him such a high evaluation. If he didn’t, it would only seem like he was being miserly. As for Chu Feng, he was never a miserly individual.

“Is that Baili Xinghe the strongest of the younger generation in the Holy Land of Martialism right now?” Tantai Xue asked curiously. It was evident that she was also astonished by Baili Xinghe’s powerful strength.

“While Baili Xinghe is very powerful, he shouldn’t be the most powerful. At the very least, the Four Great Imperial Clans all possess members of the younger generation as powerful as him.”

“I presume that the Mortal King Palace, the Underworld palace and the Heavenly Law Palace would likely also possess members of the younger generation as powerful as him.”

“As for the Elf Kingdom, there’s no need to mention them. I suspect they have more than just one member of the younger generation as powerful as him.”

“However, regardless, Baili Xinghe could represent the tallest stepping stone among our current Holy Land of Martialism’s younger generation,” Nangong Ya replied.

“He’s still not the strongest? In that case, how powerful is the strongest member of the younger generation? What sort of cultivation does he or she have now?” Tantai Xue began to guess curiously.

“Strongest? That’s very hard to define. While we’re all members of the younger generation, our ages are different, and the people nurturing us are also different. Thus, it is truly extremely hard to determine who is the strongest. After all, being the strongest now does not mean that they will remain the strongest later on.”

“If I had to determine who was the strongest among our younger generation, then I would have to base it on talent. If I am to be the judge, then, among all the people I’ve encountered, I think that Brother Chu Feng is the strongest,” Nangong Ya said as he looked to Chu Feng.

“Me? I’m merely a rank eight Martial King. You don’t have to joke around with me,” Chu Feng shook his head with a smile.

“Brother Chu Feng, there is no need for you to be this modest. I have personally seen your strength. I dare guarantee that, with your talent, you will, sooner or later, surpass even that Baili Xinghe,” Nangong Ya said.

“However, other than you, Brother Chu Feng, I feel that there’s another individual capable of competing against you. Her talent is truly too frightening,” Nangong Ya added.

“Who is it?” Tantai Xue asked curiously.

“I’ve heard that there’s a little princess from the Elf Kingdom who is a super genius rarely seen even in ten thousand years. She was already a Martial King when she was born. When she was ten years old, she became a Half Martial Emperor. As for her current age, she should only be a bit older than Moli. However, I reckon that her cultivation would not be any weaker than Baili Xinghe’s.”

“She is a true genius. Not only does she possess exceptional talent, she was also born to an enormous family. I truly cannot assess how powerful she will become in the future,” Nangong Ya said.

“There’s actually a person that powerful?” After hearing what Nangong Ya said, Chu Feng was startled.

To be born a Martial King and become a Half Martial Emperor at the age of ten was truly a bit too powerful. One must know that Chu Feng had only started on the path of martial cultivation when he was ten years old. At that time, not to mention Martial Kings, even Heaven Realm-level experts were like legends to him.

“Actually, that is normal too. Not to mention that the Elf Kingdom’s princess is a rare genius rarely seen in ten thousand years, the methods at the Elf Kingdom’s disposal to nurture their younger generation are also things that we cannot compare against.”

“After all, they have existed for so long, and they have remained the strongest power in the Holy Land of Martialism this entire time. As such, how could the geniuses that they nurture possibly be ordinary?”

“Other than the several Overlord’s eras, the Ancient Era’s Elves have always been the true rulers of the Holy Land of Martialism. Neither we humans nor the monstrous beasts dare to provoke the Ancient Era’s Elves.”

“Thus, after Emperor Qing’s time, the Ancient Era’s Elves have been the strongest power in the Holy Land of Martialism. Naturally, the strongest member of the younger generation in the Holy Land of Martialism should also be from them,” Nangong Ya said.
