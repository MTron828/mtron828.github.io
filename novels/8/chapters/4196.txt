Chapter 4196 - Beasts Invasion

“Chu Feng, listen carefully! You are not allowed to bother Menglu anymore!”

“In addition, you must keep your mouth shut! If you dare to mention what happened here today, I will beat you up every time I see you!” Xiao Yu threatened fiercely.

Seeing how impressive her big brother Xiao Yu was, Zhao Menglu was both scared and proud.

Then, Xiao Yu looked fiercely at Zhao Menglu. “Menglu, you make sure to properly reflect on your actions too!”

After saying those words, he leapt into the air and left.

Zhao Menglu and the others thought that Xiao Yu had left because he was angry.

What they didn’t know was that Xiao Yu didn’t fly far before descending into the forest again.

After landing, Xiao Yu crouched onto the ground. His face twisted as he grimaced in pain. Fear appeared in his eyes as he looked at his shattered hand.

“What is going on with that guy? Why is his body as tough as a treasure?”

“My hand... I’m actually unable to recover it?”

Xiao Yu was terrified.

He didn’t understand why his hand would end up that way after punching Chu Feng.

Naturally, he had no idea that Chu Feng’s body was still that of an Utmost Exalted even though his cultivation was sealed.

As a mere Martial Ancestor, Xiao Yu had actually dared to attack Chu Feng physically with his own body. Such an action was no different from seeking his own doom.

Unless Chu Feng decided to help treat his injuries, there was simply no one there that could heal his hand.

Even the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk would not be able to help him.

His hand had been crippled.

......

Chu Feng stood up. He was completely fine.

Xiao Yu’s punch had shattered his hand. But, being struck by the punch, Chu Feng only felt as if something had bumped into him.

Perhaps this was the benefit of being a cultivator.

Should one reach a certain level of cultivation, those weaker than them would not be able to do anything to them even if they decided to mount a sneak attack during sleep.

That said, although Chu Feng had been struck by Xiao Yu’s punch, he did not take things to heart.

He did not plan to continue bickering with those people. He felt that they were not qualified for him to go to war against.

Chu Feng continued to pick fruits.

But, as Chu Feng continued to walk, he suddenly felt a sting of pain coming from his body.

That pain had soon filled his entire body. It had originated from his World Spirit Space.

“Crap!”

Chu Feng shouted in his heart upon sensing the pain.

What he was worried about was not himself. Instead, it was Yu Sha and Eggy.

Yu Sha and Eggy were still training in his World Spirit Space.

Right when Chu Feng tried to cast his consciousness into his World Spirit space, he felt dizzy and all his power disappeared.

It was the World Spirit World!

The World Spirit World was devouring all of his strength.

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng soon fell unconscious on the ground.

After an unknown amount of time passed, Chu Feng woke all of a sudden.

Upon waking up, Chu Feng didn’t say anything, but immediately cast his consciousness into his World Spirit Space.

Upon entering his World Spirit Space, Chu Feng immediately rushed to find Eggy and Yu Sha.

Upon discovering that both of them were fine, Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief.

“This feeling?”

Soon, a look of joy appeared on his face.

He was shocked to discover that his spirit power had returned.

Because of that, Chu Feng immediately looked at the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

At the beginning, the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk looked completely normal. But, when Chu Feng’s gaze landed directly on it, it immediately started reacting.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk began to release blood-colored gaseous flames.

The blood-colored gaseous flames began to transform in Chu Feng’s World Spirit Space.

They formed four series of words...

‘The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk is an artifact that once belonged to the founder of the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect.’

‘It was forged using Heaven-plundering Ash-crystal Stone, Seven Realms Immortal Feather Silk and the Immemorial Sacred Beast’s Blood.’

‘This treasure is capable of breaching secret grounds, plundering rare opportunities, protecting its master and strengthening spirit formations.’

‘It is one of the Celestial Master’s Sacred Sect’s Ten Great Sect-protection Treasures!’

After seeing the series of words floating in midair, Chu Feng had learned the origin of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk then began to float towards Chu Feng.

Holding the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk in his hand, Chu Feng was finally able to vividly sense how powerful of a treasure it was.

At that moment, he was endlessly excited.

As a world spiritist, being able to obtain such a treasure was simply akin to giving wings to a tiger.

“Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, you’ve truly given me an enormous gift,” Chu Feng said happily.

As his spirit power had recovered, Chu Feng immediately examined his body.

After all, it should be impossible for his cultivation to be sealed for no reason.

Soon, Chu Feng found the cause.

His soul had been sealed by a layer of dark black energy.

That dark black energy was very dangerous. The more Chu Feng examined it, the more obvious the danger it posed became.

That... was most likely the power that had been emitted by the black spirit formation gate.

Once Chu Feng discovered it, he immediately used his spirit power to remove it.

Fortunately, although the dark black energy was dangerous, there was not a lot of it. Chu Feng had managed to effortlessly remove the energy from his soul.

After that, both Chu Feng’s cultivation and world spirit techniques returned to normal.

“Senior Zhuge Yuankong, I am finally able to experience this treasure trove you’ve left behind.”

Chu Feng felt that since his condition had returned to normal, it was time for him to properly explore this world.

“Bang---”

“Bang---”

“Bang---”

Suddenly, rumbles sounded from outside.

It actually came from the direction where the residents lived.

But, according to Chu Feng’s knowledge, that place should be very safe. Not to mention the spirit formation beasts, even ferocious beasts and wild beasts would not dare set foot in that region. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Thus, why would rumbles sound from there?

Moreover, there were energy ripples wreaking havoc throughout the region.

Chu Feng realized that something bad was happening, and immediately began flying over.

......

Within the safe zone, all the cultivators in the residential area had flown out of their houses.

They were all assembled inside a protective formation and looking nervously into the distance.

That place was the border of their residential area.

It originally had an invisible protective formation. Both the ferocious beasts and spirit formation beasts were unable to breach it .

Yet at that moment, not only had the spirit formation beasts breached the spirit formation, there were also tens of thousands of them. They were all fiercely rushing towards the safe zone.

Those spirit formation beasts were each dozens of meters tall. They had humanoid bodies and pitch-black skin. Their eyes were blood-red and their claws blade-sharp. As for their faces, they looked extremely hideous and fierce.

There wasn’t a nose on their face. Yet, there were tens of eyes. Those eyes were all packed together in multiple layers. It was a truly disgusting sight.

But, the most terrifying aspect of the spirit formation beasts was not their hideous appearances.

Rather, it was their strength. Practically every single one of them were Martial Immortal-level beings.

For the great majority of the people present, Martial Immortal was a cultivation that they could not contend against.

Fortunately, there were two figures holding weapons and standing before the protective formation, fighting those spirit formation beasts.

One was the Golden Crane True Immortal.

As for the other, he was the plain-clothed old monk.

“Old Poisonous Substance, what’s going on? How did you manage to lure all these monsters here?” the Golden Crane True Immortal asked as he fought against the spirit formation beasts continuously.

He had realized that the spirit formation beasts that had appeared were different from the ones they had encountered in the past.

Not only were those spirit formation beasts more vicious, they were also able to breach that protective formation.

“I entered a dangerous area and found a black gate.”

“After pushing open that black gate, those spirit formation beasts appeared. Their numbers are simply too many,” said the plain-clothed old monk.

“No matter how many there are, they shouldn’t be a match for you. Why didn’t you get rid of them before returning? Why lure them all here?” criticized the Golden Crane True Immortal.

“If I could get rid of them or shake them off, I wouldn’t have lured them back.”

“It’s simply impossible to kill all these spirit formation beasts. Furthermore, they’re too fast. I’m unable to shake them off. I’ve already fought them for multiple days and nights.”

“If I continued to fight them, I’d die from exhaustion.”

“It’s because I had no other choice that I decided to return.”

“After all, the protective formation here should’ve been able to keep them outside.”

“Who would’ve thought that these monsters would be unaffected by the spirit formation?”

The plain-clothed old monk was filled with endless regret. In the end, he had underestimated the spirit formation beasts.

“Old Poisonous Substance, you’ve courted a disaster!” cursed the Golden Crane True Immortal.

But, as things had already gotten to this point, there was nothing else they could do.

The two of them had no choice but to stop the spirit formation beasts with their all. If a single spirit formation beast got past them, it would be fatal to all the cultivators behind them.
