Chapter 5146: Stealing the First Move

“Milord, we wouldn’t dare harbor such greedy intent. We were going to first confirm whether this is Lord Zhenlong’s ancient remnant or not before reporting it to the Totem Dragon Clan.”

Situ Tingye fell to his knees. Cold sweat was dripping down his face.

“Is that so?” Bai Yunqing expressed his skepticism, but he quickly shrugged it off. “Forget it, I’ll give you a chance to make up for your mistakes. Open this ancient remnant together with me, and I won’t pursue this matter anymore.”

“Understood, milord,” Situ Tingye replied with a clasped fist.

“Lead the way,” Bai Yunqing ordered.

Situ Tingye quickly rose to his feet and led the way for Bai Yunqing. Chu Feng discreetly followed the group.

It was a completely different world on the other side of the disguise formation, a paradise filled with mysterious lush plants and animals. These animals were incapable of cultivation but they were all breathtakingly beautiful.

What was the most eye-catching of all was a palace sitting not too far away. Gray in color and squarish in shape, it had no windows and the doors were tightly shut. There was a powerful formation embedded in the walls, making the palace nigh indestructible.

This was the entrance to the ancient remnant.

Those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan had already set up a formation to open the gates. The formation consisted of 24 formation cores, and it required 24 God-cloak World Spiritists to simultaneously channel them. There were various peculiar treasures placed within the formation, and they surprisingly emanated auras that were similar to that of the palace.

This showed that the Situ World Spiritist Clan was well-prepared here. They had already acquired the treasures required to open the ancient remnant, and this discovery wasn’t just a coincidence.

Had they been a little later, the Situ World Spiritist Clan might have already acquired all of the treasures inside.

“Elder Yuwei, do you know what kind of person Bai Yunqing’s master is?” Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.

It was apparent from the reaction of those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan that Bai Yunqing had a powerful master.

“His master is likely to be Taishi Xingzhong, the First Guest Elder of the Totem Dragon Clan. His position in the Totem Dragon Clan is comparable to Lord Zhenlong back then. Based on what I know, Taishi Xingzhong was already a True Dragon World Spiritist back then, and he’s bound to have made further progress over the years.

“It’s no wonder why Bai Yunqing has reached such heights despite his young age. It only makes sense for him to be that strong given his master,” Song Yuwei said.

“Elder Yuwei, is Bai Yunqing’s cultivation considered exceptional in the Totem Galaxy?” Chu Feng asked.

He could tell from Song Yuwei’s reaction that Bai Yunqing’s strength was abnormal even by the standards of the Totem Galaxy.

“I don’t know how powerful the current juniors of the Totem Galaxy are, but Bai Yunqing would have been considered one of the top prodigies back in my era. The strongest junior back then was also only at rank two Half-God level,” Song Yuwei said.

“Oh? The strongest junior back then was only at rank two Half-God level? What about my grandmother’s cultivation back when she was still a junior?” Chu Feng asked.

“Our young miss managed to reach rank nine Martial Exalted level as a junior. She only reached Half-God level afterward. While she was the daughter of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect’s sectmaster, the Golden Dragon Flame Sect is actually an extremely weak sect compared to the rest of the Totem Galaxy. The resources it has are severely limited. It’s already impressive that our young miss was able to reach rank nine Martial Exalted level as a junior.

“If our young miss had sufficient resources, she might have been able to surpass the strongest junior of the Totem Galaxy back then,” Song Yuwei spoke with confidence.

She wasn’t only saying that out of blind belief in her young miss. Rather, it was because she understood her young miss that she was saying such words.

While Chu Feng’s grandmother wasn’t the most outstanding junior in the Totem Galaxy, her talent was unquestionable. All she was lacking was resources.

“There can be vast differences in the strength of the juniors across different generations. There was a period of time when the Totem Galaxy was lacking in younger prodigies, and there were hardly any Martial Exalted level juniors around, let alone Half-God level. I can’t really tell how talented Bai Yunqing is without a gauge for comparison,” Song Yuwei said.

Song Yuwei had lived in the Totem Galaxy for many years, so she had witnessed many generations of juniors. The average talent of juniors could vary greatly across the generations, and the definition of what constituted a prodigy would change accordingly as well.

“In any case, someone of his cultivation is anything but ordinary,” Song Yuwei quickly added.

“It looks like Bai Yunqing is truly extraordinary to receive such an evaluation from you. I’m interested to see the means of the disciple of Totem Galaxy’s strongest world spiritist.”

Chu Feng never thought that he would come across such a strong rival shortly after he arrived in the Totem Galaxy. Bai Yunqing was clearly here for the legendary world spiritist’s ancient remnant, which made competition between the two of them inevitable.

Bai Yunqing wouldn’t be an easy opponent, but Chu Feng was never one to shy away from a challenge. On the contrary, he was delighted to encounter such a rival right after stepping onto the Totem Galaxy.

Boom boom!

The earth suddenly began trembling. The tremors seemed to be coming from the palace doors.

“Is it a success?”

Those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan were delighted to see that.

Crrrk!

The palace doors creaked open. However, it didn’t open fully, revealing just a small crack.

Hu!

A subtle rush of energy suddenly surged out from the door crack and brushed across everyone present, including Chu Feng and Song Yuwei. It was invisible and could only be barely felt when brushing across one’s skin.

“Young master Chu Feng, do you feel that?” Song Yuwei asked. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I do. It’s coming from the ancient remnant,” Chu Feng replied.

Thanks to the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, Chu Feng had a clearer sensing of the energy than everyone else. The crowd could feel the energy lingering around them, but any information other than that would have to be done through deduction.

However, Chu Feng was able to clearly sense the nature of the energy. That was the prowess of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

“Young master Chu Feng, do you know what this is?” Song Yuwei asked.

“Lord Grand Elder, I can feel some kind of energy shrouding me.”

“Me too. Lord Grand Elder, what is this?”

The crowd from the Situ World Spiritist Clan turned to Situ Tingye for answers, but the truth was that Situ Tingye had no idea what was going on too. They could guess that the energy was related to the ancient remnant’s opening, but they couldn’t figure out anything other than that.

In comparison, Bai Yunqing looked much more composed. He took out a compass.

“Lord Zhenlong, I am Bai Yunqing. I have come for your legacy, and I’ll prove to you that I am the person you are waiting for.”

Bai Yunqing formed a series of hand seals, and the compass started directing a ray of light at the palace gates.

Through the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk’s sensory ability, Chu Feng could sense the energy coming from the gate flowing into Bai Yunqing’s compass, where it was redirected into his body.

“What is he doing? Is he consuming the energy here?” Song Yuwei asked.

Despite being unable to sense the energy changes in the surroundings, she was still able to make deductions through direct observation.

“Lord Yuwei, didn’t you ask me what that energy was? It’s the preliminary key to unraveling the formation,” Chu Feng replied.

“Preliminary key?” Song Yuwei asked.

“Yes, the energy harnesses an opportunity in it. Those who are able to obtain its acknowledgment will receive an advantage from it when the door fully opens. The energy might be all around us now, but one will have to first earn its acknowledgment before being able to absorb it.

“However, it seems like Bai Yunqing’s compass allows him to easily attain the acknowledgment of the energy. He’s forcefully taking the preliminary key for himself,” Chu Feng replied.

“He’s the disciple of Taishi Xingzhong, after all. It wouldn’t be surprising for him to have such treasures on him. What do we do?” Song Yuwei asked.

“Calm down, Elder Yuwei. This treasure of mine allows me to clinch the preliminary key as well.”

Chu Feng turned to the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk in his hand. From the moment the energy appeared, he could already sense some changes occurring with it. In fact, it was through it that he was able to understand the true nature of the energy.

Weng!

As soon as Chu Feng channeled the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, the energy started surging into his body. Due to the discreet nature of the energy, none of the world spiritists noticed this occurrence, not even Bai Yunqing.

On top of that, the rate at which Chu Feng was siphoning away the energy was much faster than Bai Yunqing.

“As expected of the Celestial Master Sacred Sect’s clan-protection treasure,” Chu Feng murmured gleefully.

As formidable as Bai Yunqing’s compass was, it was not a match for Chu Feng’s Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk at all.

“Hm? This feeling…”

Chu Feng suddenly frowned. He sensed that someone else other than him and Bai Yunqing was trying to siphon away the energy. A third person had noticed the true nature of the energy as well, and he possessed the means to capitalize on it.
