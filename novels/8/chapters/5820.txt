Chapter 5820: Asura Palace

Around an hour later, a pink aura similar to that of her Immortal Sea Mansion began to envelop her. Her Immortal Sea Mansion contracted to the size of a bead before fusing into her body.

A majestic phenomenon surrounding Little Fishy enveloped this space.

By the time the phenomenon dissipated, the crowd sensed that Little Fishy’s cultivation had risen by a rank. She was now a rank seven Half-God level cultivator.

“Little sister, you succeeded?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked. He could hardly conceal his smile.

“That’s right. Big brother, you’ll have to work harder. Don’t mess it up here, or else I’ll use this against you for the rest of your life,” Little Fishy said with a mischievous smile.

“Don’t worry. I shan’t let you dump me behind,” Xianhai Shaoyu said with a confident smile. From his ability to have a casual conversation with Little Fishy despite being amid taming his mansion, this wasn’t difficult for him.

Not long later, he succeeded. A phenomenon occurred when the Dao Creation Building entered his body, and his cultivation rose by a rank to rank eight Half-God level.

Wang Qiang succeeded next. His cultivation rose by a rank to rank seven Half-God level.

Some time later, the others also succeeded in constructing their Dao Creation Buildings and proceeded to the taming phase.

In contrast, Chu Feng, despite being the first to start, was still in the midst of his construction. He got increasingly concentrated, to the point he completely disregarded what was happening in his surroundings. His composed expression slowly strained up.

“Will Chu Feng be fine?” Feng Ling asked worriedly. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Xian Miaomiao, who had begun taming her Dao Creation Building, kept looking at Chu Feng too. She didn’t say a word, but the worry in her eyes was apparent.

“Don’t worry, M-M-Miss Feng Ling. My brother must be challenging something more difficult, or e-e-else he wouldn’t have been struggling,” Wang Qiang said.

“Something more difficult? Brother Wang Qiang, did you sense something?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“N-n-nope,” Wang Qiang replied.

“Little sister, what about you?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked Little Fishy.

Little Fishy shook her head.

“What’s going on?” Xianhai Shaoyu looked at Chu Feng with curious eyes.

Feng Ling, Xian Miaomiao, and the others had succeeded in their construction, though they struggled to tame their Dao Creation Building and there was a chance they might fail here. Meanwhile, Chu Feng, despite having begun earlier, still hadn’t finished his construction.

Xianhai Shaoyu wasn’t worried about Chu Feng failing. He was confident Chu Feng would succeed. In fact, like Wang Qiang, he thought that Chu Feng’s final product could be different from them. Nevertheless, he was still curious as to why Chu Feng was struggling right now.

Why is it because our intelligence is lower than him, and we’re failing to see a deeper aspect of this trial?

“It could be due to the energy he chose,” Little Fishy said.

“Oh? Little sister, isn’t the black energy of the same tier as your golden energy?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

Wang Qiang also looked at Little Fishy in curiosity.

“There is a difference. While the black energy is at the same level as the golden energy, the former is more aggressive in its mental attacks. I was planning to construct my building with the black energy together with big brother, but I couldn’t focus my attention on capturing them. That’s why I went for the golden energy instead,” Little Fishy explained.

“I see. So that’s where the problem lies. It’s a problem with the material,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng’s speed of construction accelerated. His progress suddenly sped up exponentially, to the point where even Xianhai Shaoyu and the others were taken aback.

In a blink of an eye, Chu Feng finished his building.

Boom!

The space shook violently, distracting those focused on taming their Dao Creation Buildings.

The source of this shaking was Chu Feng’s Dao Creation Building. It was transforming to its true form, but there hadn’t been such a stir when Little Fishy, Wang Qiang, or Xianhai Shaoyu completed their buildings earlier.

“The hell!” Wang Qiang widened his mouth.

Their buildings were all mansions, but Chu Feng’s building was a majestic palace.

It was a black palace that gave off a domineering aura. The black aura shrouding the palace encompassed a larger area, and there would be occasional flashes of nine-colored lightning from it. The palace felt lofty as if it was from the heavenly realm or the demonic realm.

“T-t-this isn’t a Dao Creation Building anymore. It’s a Dao Creation Palace!” Wang Qiang exclaimed.

Just then, the deep voice inside the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation echoed, “Please name your Dao Creation Palace.”

“The hell! It is r-r-really called Dao Creation Palace! It’s superior t-t-to what we have constructed. No w-w-wonder it took him so long! Brother, you s-s-should have told us if you’re constructing a p-p-palace. Look at how shabby my m-m-mansion looks,” Wang Qiang said.

“I didn’t know it would transform in such a manner either,” Chu Feng replied.

“Stammerer, don’t distract my big brother from his naming,” Little Fishy said.

“A-a-all right.” Wang Qiang nodded before abruptly raising his head. “Stammerer?! You look so obedient, but y-y-your words are so awful!”

“It’ll be fine once you get used to it. She’s only nice to Brother Chu Feng,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“I get you now, Brother S-S-Shaoyu. Little sister can’t be depended on,” Wang Qiang agreed.

Chu Feng stared at the majestic black palace, as he thought about how he should name his Dao Creation Palace. Eventually, two words came out of his mouth, “Asura Palace.”

The words ‘Asura Palace’ appeared on the plaque.

Chu Feng had given serious thought to this name. His current accomplishments could be credited to the nine-colored lightning and the help of many benefactors, but the person he was the most grateful to was still Eggy, who had accompanied him all this while.

It seemed a bit thoughtless to name the palace Eggy, so he decided to name it after her place of birth instead.

On top of that, the world spirits currently serving him were from the Asura Spirit World too, and his capabilities as a world spiritist were inherited from his mother. No matter how he looked at it, the word ‘Asura’ had special significance to him.
