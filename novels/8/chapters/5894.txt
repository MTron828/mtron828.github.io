Chapter 5895: Special Legacy

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and the others stepped into the spirit formation gate and were brought into a mysterious space. This space was completely white in color, such that they couldn’t even differentiate whether they were stepping on the ground or floating in mid-air.

The only color in the realm was the spirit formation gate where they came from.

Chu Feng and the others advanced into the realm while observing their surroundings.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief stepped forward and asked, “Chu Feng, why did you say those words earlier?”

“Elder Clan Chief, there was information on the spirit formation gate’s barrier. I made my deductions based on that. This realm isn't the original home of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan. Rather, it’s a training ground that they prepared for their descendants. That’s why the sacred mountain has a system of rewards and punishments.”

In truth, Chu Feng had already grasped the way to breach the formation from the start, but he noticed additional information on it, which was why he spent another twenty hours observing it.

“What else did you decipher?” the clan chief asked.

Clearly, he knew the origin of this place too. In contrast, Sansheng Qiutian and Sansheng Xingyu looked confused.

“The strongest formation energy lies in the sacred temple. The ancestors of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan left a special legacy for their descendants there.”

“Legacy? What kind of legacy?” Sansheng Qiutian’s eyes lit up.

“I don’t know the details either,” Chu Feng replied.

Sansheng Qiutian turned to his father.

“I only know that we’ll obtain unimaginable power if we breach the final formation. It might allow our clan to undergo metamorphosis, but I don’t know whether it’s a legacy or not,” the clan chief said. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Did you decipher anything else?”

“As long as the final two formations are breached, the special legacy in the sacred temple will be bestowed to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan. The formation my father entered has closed, so I can’t enter it anymore. However, if he failed, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan won’t receive the legacy even if I cleared the second formation,” Chu Feng said.

Zi Ling’s eyes lit up upon hearing those words. “That means that if the Three Saints Monstrous Clan receives the special legacy after big brother Chu Feng clears the formation, it will prove that my master breached the first formation back then, and the loss of the sacred treasures had nothing to do with him?”

“Not necessarily, but it’d at least prove that my father did successfully breach the first formation,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“That’s great!” Sansheng Qiutian was overjoyed.

Chu Feng felt warmth surging into his heart, as this proved that Sansheng Qiutian wanted to help Chu Xuanyuan right his name too.

“Thus far, we have believed that the disappearance of the sacred treasures is related to Chu Xuanyuan’s failure to breach the formation. However, if you can prove that Chu Xuanyuan had successfully breached the formation back then, there will be reasonable doubt to believe that our sacred treasures disappeared for another reason.

“I, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, promise to right your father’s name if that’s the case. However, how can you prove that what you have said is true?” the clan chief asked.

“This is the final formation. As long as I breach it, what I have deciphered from the barrier will become plain for everyone to read. The truth will be apparent,” Chu Feng replied.

“Good. I’ll look forward to it. Where should we head now?” the clan chief asked.

“Lord Father, why do you keep looking to Chu Feng for answers?” Sansheng Qiutian asked. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Young friend Chu Feng is a world spiritist,” the clan chief replied.

“You entered the sacred temple many times with Elder Chu Xuanyuan and breached many formations together. You should be the most experienced one of us all. Yet, it feels like you’re just as ignorant as me,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“Cough cough! My son, I have experience with the other formations, but it’s my first time dealing with this one,” the clan chief explained.

“That’s true, father, but... this is Chu Feng’s first time entering the sacred mountain. Don’t you think it’s a bit embarrassing if we aren’t able to do anything to help even though this is our turf?” Sansheng Qiutian looked at his father with a frown.

“Well... Hahaha...” Black streaks appeared on the clan chief’s face.

Even Chu Feng could sense the sheer rage building inside the clan chief, though this made him think that the clan chief was a good father. Most people in his place would have hurled a slap at Sansheng Qiutian by now.

Powerful cultivators tended to be proud, given the influence they would wield and the respect they received from others, which led them to care about their reputation. Yet, the clan chief remained relatively patient with Sansheng Qiutian despite the latter’s frequent rude remarks.

This showed that he truly doted on his son.

“It’s only normal for cultivators to struggle with deciphering formations. Cultivators and world spiritists have their strengths, after all. However, there’s no need to worry. I am confident in my skills as a world spiritist. As long as you trust me, I’ll lead you to the destination.” Chu Feng stood up for the clan chief.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief unhesitatingly grasped at the straw of salvation. “Of course we do.”

Chu Feng picked a direction and began marching forward. It didn’t take long for the spirit formation gate they had entered the realm by to disappear from their sight.

Chu Feng feared that this space might have some kind of energy to confuse him, so he left marks with his spirit power along the way.

An hour later, another color finally appeared in the distance—a desert was right ahead of them. While the desert was barren too, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was overjoyed to be freed from the monotonous white surroundings.

“We’re finally out.” The clan chief heaved a sigh of relief after seeing a ray of hope.

Chu Feng quickly led them toward the desert.

The group couldn’t help but turn to look at the monotonous white world behind them, and it somehow felt rather peculiar. On one side was a seeming illusory realm devoid of anything, whereas the other side was a lifelike desert.

They knew that these were all manifested from formations, but it was still hard to discern truth from falsehood. It felt like they had wandered from the world of dreams into reality.

Boom!

All of a sudden, thunderous rumbles boomed. Dark lightning clouds instantaneously enveloped the clear sky above them.

Before Chu Feng and the others could react, tremendous pressure suddenly enveloped all of them.

While Chu Feng hesitated whether he should resort to the Divine Deer’s power, an equally terrifying oppressive might suddenly gushed toward the sky. It was coming from the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.

He formed a barrier with his oppressive might to protect Chu Feng and the others.

“How is it? You still have to rely on me in the end, huh? ”

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was delighted to get a chance to prove himself. He immediately looked at Sansheng Qiutian and smirked. It was such a childish response that he looked nothing like a chief of a powerful clan.
