Chapter 2718 - You Are Not Qualified

“Bullshit! Even if you do not wish to admit your defeat, you should still find a better excuse.”

“Do you think that we are fools that will believe that sort of excuse?” Chu Xianshuo said.

“What big brother Chu Xianshuo said is very correct. Chu Feng, you are simply too shameless. Your spirit formation has clearly been pierced through by my big brother Chu Xianshuo, yet you still dare to say that you allowed it to pass through. You have no sense of shame at all!”

At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations also began to lash out at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng sighed. “Sure enough, it is meaningless to bother to explain to a bunch of fools like you all.”

“Since that’s the case, I, Chu Feng, should just have reality speak for me.”

“As for you all, make sure to open your eyes wide and properly bear witness to what will happen.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he spread open one hand. Then, he tightly clenched that open palm.

The next moment, a ‘snap’ was heard. The spear formation that Chu Xianshuo had set up was actually severed in two.

After that spear was severed, it turned into golden-bright and dazzling spirit power before dissipating into thin air.

Immediately after the spear was severed, Chu Feng’s defensive formation that was pierced through by the spear was immediately made whole again. There was no sign of damage at all.

“This!!!”

Seeing that scene, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations and the experts outside the hunting ground all revealed surprised expressions.

Even the experts outside were stunned by what had just happened.

It was only at that moment that they realized what had happened.

It turned out, while Chu Feng’s defensive formation appeared to be very weak, it was actually extremely powerful, and greatly surpassed Chu Xianshuo’s formation.

Thinking about it, a defensive formation was actually capable of easily destroying a formation meant to breach and destroy a formation.

From this, it could be seen how powerful Chu Feng’s defensive formation was.

They were all deceived by Chu Feng earlier.

“That Chu Feng is amazing. Even we were deceived by him.”

The experts outside the hunting ground exclaimed in admiration.

That said, it was understandable that they would be deceived, since they were only able to see the appearance of Chu Feng’s defensive formation, and were not capable of sensing the strength it possessed.

However, they were very confident in themselves, confident in their eyes, confident that they could tell whether Chu Feng’s or Chu Xianshuo’s spirit formation was stronger.

It was only at that moment that they realized that Chu Feng was not arrogant and conceited. Instead, it was they who had been overly confident. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Chu Xianshuo, did you see that?”

“Your so-called Divine Dragon Spear Formation is simply unable to withstand a single blow from my defensive formation.”

“Let me ask you, do you still think that your Divine Dragon Spear Formation is capable of destroying my defensive formation?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile on his face.

“You!!!”

Chu Xianshuo’s complexion turned ashen. He seemed to want to say something, but didn’t know what to say.

With how enormous the disparity between the two spirit formations was, he was unable to find any excuse for himself.

Overwhelmed with anger, he actually took several steps back, opened his mouth and ‘puu,’ sprayed out a mouthful of blood.

That Chu Xianshuo was actually angered to a state of vomiting blood by Chu Feng.

“Big brother Chu Xianshuo!”

Withessing that scene, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were all frightened.

One by one, they rushed to Chu Xianshuo and took out their healing medicines to feed to him.

However, not only did Chu Xianshuo refuse those medicines, but he also ignored them.

This caused the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations to become even more panicky.

Suddenly, Chu Xianshuo revealed a smile on his expressionless face.

“Hahaha...”

The next moment, Chu Xianshuo burst into frantic laughter. His laughter was not only ear-piercing, it was also very frightening.

This was especially true with Chu Xianshuo’s fierce expression. Looking at it, one would be scared.

“Chu Feng, did you think that you’d already won?”

“Let me tell you this: you’re wrong. I, Chu Xianshuo, haven’t even gone all-out against you yet.”

“However, since you dare to force me to such a state, I will have you know my true strength!”

As Chu Xianshuo spoke, he moved his hand over his Cosmos Sack. The next moment, a handful of medicinal pellets appeared in his hand.

Those medicinal pellets seemed to be made of gold. However, they were each filled with veined patterns that were moving about as if they were alive.

It was as if each and every one of those medicinal pellets was a world in itself, and contained many living creatures within them.

“Those are... forbidden world spirit medicines?”

Upon seeing the medicinal pellets in Chu Xianshuo’s hand, there was a change in expression in the eyes of all the experts outside.

As expert world spiritists, they all knew what Chu Xianshuo was holding in his hand.

Those were medicinal pellets capable of increasing one’s world spirit power. However, they were deemed forbidden medicines. The reason for that was because one would receive a backlash upon using them.

Furthermore, the forbidden world spirit medicines Chu Xianshuo was holding in his hand possessed extraordinary quality.

“Never would I have imagined that Chu Xianshuo would be forced to such a state.”

At that moment, many people outside the hunting ground started to sigh and shake their heads. Sighing sounds were being heard from all over the place.

Even if Chu Xianshuo was to win using forbidden world spirit medicines, he would have won with an unfair advantage.

However, Chu Xianshuo evidently did not care about any of that anymore. He was determined to win by fair means or foul.

He knew very well that using those forbidden world spirit medicines would be an unfair advantage. However, who would dare call him out on that?

On the other hand, if he were to be defeated by Chu Feng, he would be utterly humiliated. Not only would people start to ridicule him, but he would also be sneered at by his clansmen upon his return to the Chu Heavenly Clan. He would no longer be able to raise his head before his family and his elders.

Thus, he must win. Regardless of what the price would be, he must defeat Chu Feng.

Thinking up to that point, Chu Xianshuo opened his mouth wide and swallowed all of the forbidden world spirit medicines he held in his palm.

Evidently... he also knew that Chu Feng would not be that easy to handle.

Thus, he had decided to go all-out to fight against Chu Feng.

After the forbidden medicines entered his body, Chu Xianshuo’s body started to emit a golden radiance.

That was not spirit power. Rather, it was purely a change that occurred to his body after taking the forbidden medicines.

The next moment, Chu Xianshuo immediately began to set up a spirit formation.

“That spirit formation! No wonder Chu Xianshuo said he hadn’t gone all-out yet. So what he meant by going all-out was not taking those forbidden world spirit medicines, but rather that spirit formation.”

The fiery red-haired old man started to frown tightly. He was able to tell exactly what Chu Xianshuo was planning to do.

The spirit formation Chu Xianshuo was setting up at that moment was extremely powerful.

It was precisely because that spirit formation was so powerful that Chu Xianshuo needed to consume forbidden medicines to set it up.

At that moment, those with discerning eyes were able to tell that the spirit formation Chu Xianshuo was setting up at that moment was going to be his final trump card.

However, Chu Feng continued to stand there without doing anything. He was just watching Chu Xianshuo set up his spirit formation like an observer. There was no sign of him planning to do anything to stop Chu Xianshuo.

Finally, Chu Xianshuo finished setting up his spirit formation. At that moment, his body had fused with his spirit formation. He had become the core of his spirit formation.

It was an enormous sword. The sword was over a hundred meters long. Chu Xianshuo was standing in the center of the sword.

“That spirit formation is simply too powerful! Big brother Chu Xianshuo is destined to win!”

Being inside the hunting ground, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were capable of sensing how powerful that world spirit formation sword was.

It was true, the spirit formation Chu Xianshuo had set up was extremely powerful. At the very least, it was over a hundred times more powerful than that spear.

However, even with that being the case, there was no trace of fear on Chu Feng’s face.

Chu Feng was very calm. He looked calmly to Chu Xianshuo. “Is that the spirit formation you’ve set up after putting forth all your strength?”

“Precisely. Are you prepared to die now?” Chu Xianshuo asked.

“Haha...” Chu Feng chuckled.

He said, “If that is the quality of the spirit formation that you’ve gone all-out to set up, then I’m afraid that I can only say that you are still not qualified for me, Chu Feng, to go all-out against you.”
