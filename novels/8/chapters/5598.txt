Chapter 5598: It’s None of Your Business

Chapter 5598: It’s None of Your Business

After Little Fishy left, Chu Feng quickly pulled himself together and continued his journey.

Soon, he stumbled upon a massive residence that occupied a huge area, including the ocean. Surprisingly, there weren’t many people residing in it, suggesting that they were a clan of elites.

Such powerful clans would have been considered a powerhouse in the Eastern Region, but here, their dominant standing was only limited to this realm. It was unlikely that their strength amounted to much in the scope of the starfield, let alone the entire galaxy.

This was the gap between the other galaxies and the Eastern Region, as well as the reason the other galaxies looked down on both the Ancestral Martial Galaxy and the Nine Souls Galaxy.

It couldn’t be helped, as the Eastern Region was simply too weak.

The Holy Light Clan, excluding the Holy Valley, would have been a minor power in this realm. How could the others respect the Holy Light Clan as a galaxy overlord when it couldn’t even compete with minor powers like this? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

If one equated cultivation to fortune, even the richest clans in the Eastern Region struggled to match the ordinary populace in the other galaxies. Given so, it was only normal for the Eastern Region to be thought of as a remote countryside area.

The reason the clan caught Chu Feng’s notice was due to something he witnessed. A bunch of ten-year-old children were bullying a ten-year-old boy. They were viciously beating him up, not holding back in the least at all. A group of elders watched the scene nearby, chuckling as if this was just a joke.

Through the insults the other children hurled at the boy, Chu Feng understood why the boy was receiving such treatment. It turned out that the boy was an adopted child.

This brought Chu Feng down memory lane, as that had been the treatment he had received from the Chu Clan back then. Other than his adopted father, his big brother, Chu Yue, and a few others, most of the Chu Clansmen saw him as an outsider. He suffered a lot of discrimination and bullying from a young age.

Had he not worked hard to become stronger and protect the clan, those Chu Clansmen would have never changed their attitudes toward him. Chu Feng himself was well aware of that, just that he had chosen not to harp on the matter.

“Those people need to be taught a lesson,” Eggy said.

She knew that this scene had reminded Chu Feng of his past self, which was why she was telling Chu Feng to teach them a lesson. Since the elders refused to properly discipline their juniors, an outsider would just have to do it in their stead.

This would be for the better too, since it would ingrain the right values in them. Otherwise, they would only grow up to be villains that oppressed the weak.

“Stop, stop!” A middle-aged man ran out, pushed the children aside, and hugged the boy.

“Father, wu…” The boy burst into tears upon seeing the middle-aged man. He didn’t even cry when he was being viciously beaten up earlier, but he was now crying with great indignance. “They said that I stole their items, but I didn’t!”

“Don’t cry. I’m here. It’ll be fine.” The middle-aged man wiped away the boy’s tears before turning to an elegantly–dressed lady in the crowd. “Big sister.’

Boom!

A gush of martial power pushed the middle-aged man aside. The culprit was none other than the elegantly-dressed lady.

“How dare you push my son aside? Li Hai, are you tired of living?” the elegantly-dressed lady sneered.

“Big sister, I didn’t push your son aside. I only wanted to protect Little Qiang. I didn’t hurt your child. I would never hurt my nephew!” The middle-aged man felt so indignant that he actually burst into tears as well.

“Useless trash! You’re already struggling yourself, but you still want to adopt an outsider’s child as your own. Scram! I lose my mood whenever I see you. What a disgrace to our Li Clan!” the elegantly-dressed woman sneered in disdain.

The others also ridiculed the middle-aged man too.

Those simple words enlightened Chu Feng about the current situation in the clan. The middle-aged man was of high birth, but he had a low standing in the clan due to his weak cultivation. This suggested that the clan was one that prioritized strength above everything.

Blood ties and sentiments meant nothing much in such clans, as they valued strength above all else. Those who weren’t strong enough would suffer the same fate as the middle-aged man, where even his own big sister didn’t think of him as a human being and struck him as she liked.

“Given your personality, it’s no wonder your child is so domineering too.”

Chu Feng descended from the sky and landed amongst the crowd. It could have been that he felt empathetic toward the middle-aged man or that he couldn’t stand watching the oppression, so he decided to get involved in this matter.

“Who are you?”

Chu Feng’s appearance drew the crowd’s alarm, as they released their oppressive might to display their strength. They were all at Martial Exalted level, with the strongest one being the elegant-looking lady at pinnacle Martial Exalted level.

Chu Feng didn’t answer their question. With a swoop of his hand, the children who were bullying the boy earlier floated in front of him.

“Ahhh! Mother, save me! Father, save me!”

Chu Feng hadn’t even done anything to those children other than capture them, and they had already begun crying out of fright.

“You’re courting death!”

The elegant-looking lady whipped out an Exalted Armament with a flick of her wrist and pushed her sword forth. The killing intent harnessed in her sword made it clear that she was planning to claim Chu Feng’s life.

“Hmph!”

A harrumph from Chu Feng shattered her sword intent, and she collapsed to the floor, spurting large mouthfuls of fresh blood.

“…”

It was only at this sight that the crowd realized that Chu Feng was not as simple as he looked. Some of them immediately attempted to flee from the scene, and Chu Feng didn’t stop them either.

Instead, he pointed at the children and said, “I’ll give an incense stick’s time for their birth parents to collect them. Otherwise, you’ll just have to bear the consequences.”

“T-this is my son!” one of the ladies pointed toward a boy and said.

“Catch!” Chu Feng said as he tossed the boy to the lady.

The crowd was surprised to see Chu Feng returning the child without making things difficult for the lady or the child, so more and more people started stepping forward to claim their children.

“Young hero, that’s my son over there.”

“Young hero, I’m that lass’ father.”

It didn’t take long for all of the children under Chu Feng’s control to be claimed by their parents. It turned out that all of their parents were around.

When the final child was claimed, the atmosphere around Chu Feng suddenly turned cold, as he exerted his oppressive might on them. The children weren’t affected by his oppressive might, but all of the parents were forced to kneel on the floor like dogs, unable to move at all.

“The parents should take responsibility for the child’s misdeeds,” Chu Feng said.

Someone quickly cried out, “Young hero, I have nothing to do with this! My child isn’t here!”

“I would have spared you if you had only turned a blind eye to the atrocity, but you’re an implicit accomplice to this too,” Chu Feng sneered.
