Chapter 3909 - Unreconcilation

Sure enough, when the gate opened, a figure appeared before Chu Feng.

That person was none other than Murong Wan.

Merely, the current Murong Wan greatly resembled Yan Ruyu from the mural.

She no longer had the appearance of a human. Instead, she had the look of a Galewind Hunting Clansman. That said, Chu Feng was still able to tell that she was Murong Wan.

Through the palace gate, Chu Feng was able to see two more silhouettes inside the palace. Those two people were none other than Ya Fei and Yan Ruyu.

They were really all here.

“Your Highness, someone is looking for you.”

The Royal Clansman controlled by Chu Feng pointed to him.

“You’re looking for me?”

Murong Wan sized up Chu Feng. Although she showed no guard, she revealed a look of unfamiliarity in her eyes.

“Your Highness, may I enter?” asked Chu Feng.

“You may not. You are not qualified to enter this place.”

Before Murong Wan could answer, Ya Fei’s voice was heard.

Compared to Murong Wan, Ya Fei was much more domineering and imposing.

Both her demeanor and her insufferably arrogant appearance made Chu Feng recall the time when he had first met her in the Eastern Sea Region.

Ya Fei hasn’t changed.

“Unfortunately, I must enter.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he stepped into the palace and forcibly shut the entrance gate.

“Impudence!”

The instant Chu Feng stepped into the palace, Ya Fei unleashed boundless oppressive might from her body and shot it straight toward Chu Feng.

Rank nine Exalted. That was Ya Fei’s current cultivation.

She who was so weak in the Eastern Sea Region now had such a strong cultivation.

That said, Chu Feng was no pushover himself. His Lightning Mark appeared on his forehead, and his Lightning Armor appeared on his body. In an instant, his cultivation surpassed ordinary rank nine Exalted.

His overwhelming oppressive might swept forth and not only engulfed Ya Fei’s oppressive might, but it also covered the entire palace.

At that moment, Ya Fei, and even Yan Ruyu and Murong Wan, all revealed painful expressions.

They had all been restricted by Chu Feng’s oppressive might.

Chu Feng was able to tell that even though Murong Wan and Yan Ruyu had not attacked him, their cultivations were definitely also weaker than his own. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been so easily restricted by his oppressive might.

“What audacity! You dare attack us?! Do you know who we are?!” Ya Fei shouted angrily.

Even though she was being restricted by Chu Feng’s oppressive might, she was still struggling. Most importantly, her gaze seemed like she was about to murder someone.

“The three of you, calm down. Have a look at who I am first.”

As Chu Feng spoke, his appearance began to change. He soon returned to his original appearance, returned to Chu Feng’s appearance.

Seeing Chu Feng, the three women were first stunned. However soon, an alarmed look appeared in their eyes.

“Men! Someone has disguised their way in here!” Ya Fei shouted all of a sudden.

Seeing that, Chu Feng’s heart tensed up. Evidently, the three women did not recognize him.

Otherwise, they wouldn’t have called for help.

“You three, don’t you recognize me?” Chu Feng asked with an assertive tone.

“How could we recognize you? You’re but a lowly human. Release us at once. Otherwise, once the imperial guards arrive, you will undoubtedly be killed,” said Murong Wan.

‘Damn it. What is going on here?’

Chu Feng cried out in alarm in his heart.

He was able to sense that there were indeed very powerful auras approaching the palace. However, he had clearly sealed the space with his spirit power the instant he entered the palace.

Thus, it should be impossible for their voices to reach outside.

“Exactly who are you?”

Seeing that he was forced to desperate straits, Chu Feng’s gaze turned sharp.

“You’re the one who came to find us, yet you’re asking us who we are?”

“Shouldn’t it be us asking you that question? Exactly who are you? Why did you come here? Could you be trying to assassinate us?”

Finally, Yan Ruyu spoke.

Like Murong Wan, Yan Ruyu also looked at Chu Feng like a stranger.

She didn’t recognize Chu Feng and was on-guard against him.

This was especially true after she discovered that Chu Feng was a human. With this discovery, she was brimming with hostility toward him.

‘Damn it!’

‘Exactly what is going on here?!’

Chu Feng felt completely puzzled. It would be one thing if they only looked the same. However, even their voices were the same. They should be Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan.

But, why would they not recognize him?

Why did he se Yan Ruyu’s remnant soul begging for his help before?

Could it be that they were actually from the Galewind Hunting Clan, and were merely occupying the bodies of Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan, like how the Moon Immortal had occupied the body of Su Rou and Su Mei?

But, even though the Moon Immortal had occupied their bodies, she did not cause them any harm. Su Rou and Su Mei’s souls were still in their bodies. They had merely been suppressed by the Moon Immortal.

If the three women before him were also occupying bodies, they were evidently not as soft as the Moon Immortal. It was very possible that they had already expelled Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan’s souls from their bodies.

That was the reason why Chu Feng saw Yan Ruyu’s remnant soul.

“You animals! Speak immediately, what did you do to Ya Fei, Murong Wan and Yan Ruyu?!”

Chuu Feng became furious after thinking about what might’ve happened to the three of them. As he spoke, he strengthened his oppressive might.

With that, Murong Wan, Ya Fei and Yan Ruyu all displayed pain on their faces.

“Booom~~~”

Right at that moment, the tightly closed palace hall’s gate was forced open.

Following that, an enormous oppressive might emerged out of thin air. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Chu Feng was unable to determine the cultivation of that oppressive might. He was only able to sense that it was extremely powerful.

Before that oppressive might, he felt as if he were a droplet of water that had fallen into the vast sea.

There was simply a heaven and earth-level difference between him and the person who had unleashed that oppressive might.

Should that person be willing, they would be able to easily kill him.

Finished.

At that moment, Chu Feng sighed. He felt that he was doomed.

Should that person be willing, he would be killed that very instant. He would not even have the opportunity to resist.

However, he felt unreconciled, extremely unreconciled.

It was not only because he still had a lot of things he hadn’t finished.

Instead, it was because he didn’t know what exactly had happened to Ya Fei, Murong Wan and Yan Ruyu, even in death.
