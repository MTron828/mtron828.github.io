Chapter 5279: Self-Immolation Formation

Boom!

All of a sudden, the black hand and the golden dragon exploded at the same time, causing a burst of cataclysmic energy to ripple from the sky.

“Give it your all!” the elder with yellow brows bellowed.

The four-layered Saint Dragon Shield glowed even brighter than before, but the sheer energy rippling from the sky mercilessly tore through it.

First layer. Second layer. Third layer.

The cataclysmic energy was finally stopped by the fourth layer of the shield, but even so, it inflicted countless cracks on the shield. The sight of that brought terror to the cultivators in the Skydomain Lower Realm as they finally understood the predicament they were in.

The Saint Dragon Shield was an invaluable treasure, but four layers of it only barely managed to block the shockwaves. It scared them just to imagine what would happen if there was a second wave of that attack.

Just then, Long Junlin’s voice boomed from the sky.

“Totem Dragon Clansmen, Formation: Heaven Subduing Myriad Dragons!”

With the exception of Long Zhen, the tens of millions of Totem Galaxy Clansmen began forming hand seals. Soon, their eyes emitted golden glows and golden auras gushed into the sky. Through the power of their bloodlines, they morphed into golden dragons.

Tens of millions of such golden dragons simultaneously charged at the black aura in the sky. Their presence cast a blinding golden light over the realm.

At this very instant, the Totem Dragon Clansmen, with the exception of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors, had their fighting prowess enhanced to a similar level. The resonation of their bloodlines through the formation had bestowed upon them strength surpassing their own limits.

“The Heaven Subduing Myriad Dragons Formation?”

“It really is!”

The majestic sight of tens of millions of roaring golden dragons charging at the black aura filled many younger cultivators with adrenaline. They cheered passionately for the Totem Dragon Clan.

However, those from the older generation couldn’t bring themselves to smile at all. Worry filled their eyes.

They knew that the Heaven Subduing Myriad Dragons Formation inflicted irreversible damage on those participating in the formation. In other words, the Totem Dragon Clansmen were sacrificing their own future to win this battle.

The fact that the Totem Dragon Clan was willing to go that far showed just how precarious a position they were in.

“Long Junlin, I still have a bone to pick with you. You have to win this battle!” Mo Chengzhou clenched his fists tightly.

Ningyu Shangren also looked at the sky with grim eyes.

Both of them understood that the outcome of this fight would determine their fate.

Wu!

A cry suddenly echoed as a massive golden dragon fell from the sky. A second one soon followed, then a third one, a fourth one…

In the blink of an eye, there were already hundreds of golden dragons falling from the sky.

These golden dragons were all Totem Dragon Clansmen. Some were bleeding from their seven apertures; some had become crippled. In truth, these people could already be considered lucky, for those who had lost their golden dragon form had already breathed their last.

But even those who had survived the clash were barely clinging to their lives. It was unlikely that they would survive for long.

More and more golden dragons fell from the sky, with the casualties reaching tens of thousands in a matter of moments.

Chu Feng, who had just defeated his opponent on the tenth floor, raised his head to watch the commotion, and a moment later, he heaved a deep sigh.

It was human nature to fear death, but these Totem Dragon Clansmen were willing to put their lives on the line to protect their clan’s honor and their people.

“I feel melancholic. It’s like they don’t fear death at all.” Even Eggy was moved by the sight.

“They are people who deserve to be remembered,” Chu Feng said.

It was normal for people to cower in the face of death, but the Totem Dragon Clansmen chose to stand their ground and charge at the enemy bravely. Such people deserved respect.

“Stop looking, Chu Feng. You have to hurry. The people outside are doomed. You only have yourself to count on if you wish to survive this ordeal,” Eggy said.

“I know.”

Chu Feng advanced to the eleventh floor with the Immemorial Hero’s Sword. Similar to previous floors, a monster was blocking the stairway to the next level. What was different from before was that the monster was human-shaped and wielded a spear.

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng charged forward and battled the monster.

Meanwhile, more and more dragons were falling from the sky. Over a million golden dragons had lost their lives by now, and the number was swiftly increasing with each passing second…

“Totem Dragon Clansmen, Formation: Self-Immolation!” Long Junlin ordered.

The golden auras of the Totem Dragon Clansmen still fighting in the sky changed into blood-red color.

“Self-Immolation?” Ningyu Shangren muttered in shock.

“They’re really going all out,” Mo Chengzhou said with a sigh.

They knew what the Self-Immolation Formation meant.

Unlike the Heaven Subduing Myriad Dragons Formation, which was fueled by the bloodline of the Totem Dragon Clansmen, the Self-Immolation Formation was powered by their lives. All cultivators who were involved in the formation would lose their lives unless they were strong enough to withstand the eventual backlash. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The chances were likely that no more than ten thousand Totem Dragon Clansmen would survive the backlash of the formation, and those who survived would sustain a severe trauma that they would never recover from.

In any case, the Self-Immolation Formation did provide the Totem Dragon Clansmen with a huge boost in power that allowed them to push back the dark aura. The winds of the battle seemed to be shifting in their favor.

After all, this was the strength they had obtained by burning their life force!

“Hahaha! The Totem Dragon Clan is putting its life on the line to fight me? That’s all you all amount to!” the demon monk sneered.

It was no longer possible to see the demon monk amidst the mess, but his voice was more than enough to instill rage, hatred, and fear in the people. This was the man that had single-handedly forced the Totem Dragon Clan to this point, after all!

Woosh!

All of a sudden, a golden dragon that was ten times larger than the others emerged in the sky. Taking a closer look, the crowd saw Long Junlin’s figure inside it. Needless to say, this was the golden dragon manifested by Long Junlin.

The crowd hadn’t been able to see Long Junlin all this while as he had been fighting inside the depths of the black aura, so they were understandably surprised to see that he had already retreated to the backlines.

It left them wondering why Long Junlin had to retreat. Was it because he was reaching his limit and was planning to make an escape?

The billions of cultivators watching the battle below couldn’t help but bear ominous thoughts about the situation.

While the crowd was trying to figure out the situation, Long Junlin’s golden dragon suddenly opened its mouth.

“Dragon Clan Taboo Art: Totem Dragon Breath!”

A gigantic burst of golden light harnessing unbelievable destructive prowess shot out from Long Junlin’s mouth, but It was aimed not at the sky but the ground. Its target was the black chains that had sealed off their immediate surroundings.

Boom!

It was such a powerful attack that three of the black chains were obliterated upon impact, and the resulting shockwave raised infernos that began disintegrating the nearby chains.

And the attack didn’t stop right there.

The burst of golden light continued to advance toward the black chains that had sealed off the entire realm, blasting a gaping hole right through it. Through this devastating attack, Long Junlin had created an escape path out of this sealed realm.

Weng!

While the crowd was still flabbergasted by the happenings, powerful energy suddenly enveloped the billions of cultivators in the Skydomain Lower Realm. It was from the only person from the Totem Dragon Clan who hadn’t participated in the battle—Lord Long Zhen.

Raising the only remaining Saint Dragon Shield, he charged through the gap in the black chains and headed toward a nearby teleportation formation. As long as the realm wasn’t completely sealed off, he would be able to escape using a teleportation formation.

“Lord Long Zhen?!”

The billions of cultivators in the realm were also dragged along with Lord Long Zhen’s movements.

It was only then that the crowd finally understood what was going on.

Long Junlin had descended from the black aura not to escape but to create an opening so that Long Zhen could help them escape. The crowd felt conscience-stricken for having doubted Long Junlin earlier.

Looking at the Totem Dragon Clansmen, who stood their positions despite knowing it was a suicidal move, many of the cultivators broke into tears. They would have never thought that the lofty Totem Dragon Clansmen would sacrifice themselves to save them.
