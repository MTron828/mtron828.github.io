Chapter 5818: I’m Glad You’re Here to Accompany Me

Chu Feng and Little Fishy soon reached the territory of the black specks of light.

Chu Feng first entered the territory, and Little Fishy followed him. As soon as they stepped in, the black specks of light furiously assaulted them.

“Little Fishy, are you able to take it?” Chu Feng asked.

He could sense just how formidable the black specks of light were. He couldn’t help but worry about Little Fishy despite knowing she had her unique way of coping with the pain.

“I’m fine, big brother,” Little Fishy replied with a radiant smile, though her smile was strained.

The black specks of light were so ferocious that it nearly went beyond the threshold of what Chu Feng could withstand; it was unlikely Little Fishy would fare much better.

“Let’s give it a try. We can go for something else if it doesn’t work,” Chu Feng said.

“Mm.” Little Fishy obediently nodded.

Enduring the soul-splitting pain, Chu Feng sat down and attempted to control the black specks of light with his bloodline power via the method he had comprehended from the runes. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Through the method, he would capture the specks of light entering his body using his bloodline power. As long as he successfully captured them, he would be able to use them as material for his structure.

It was just that the specks of light would intensely jolt their minds upon seeping into their bodies. There was a risk they could go berserk or even implode if they lost focus, making it hard to do anything in that state.

However, Chu Feng was able to swiftly adapt, and it wasn’t long before he successfully captured his first black speck of light. As he captured more and more black specks of light, he began to construct his structure.

“Big brother,” Little Fishy suddenly called out.

Chu Feng turned over and saw she had retreated from the black specks of light’s territory.

“Big brother, the energy here is too violent. I’m struggling to focus my attention to capture them, so I’ll try the others instead,” Little Fishy said.

“All right.” Chu Feng didn’t say too much as he could tell Little Fishy knew what she was doing.

It hadn’t been long since they entered the black specks of light’s territory. Little Fishy could withstand the assault of the black specks of light, so she could have spent a bit more time trying to capture them. The fact she had chosen not to do so meant that she had determined it to be a waste of time, and she didn’t want to waste her time and effort on it.

Even so, Chu Feng chose to keep an eye on her instead of turning his attention back to capturing the black specks of light. Even if Little Fishy knew what she was doing, he still couldn’t help worrying about her.

It was only after seeing Little Fishy stepping into the golden specks of light’s territory and confirming she was coping well that he returned to building his structure.

As time passed, Chu Feng became more proficient at capturing the black specks of light, and his construction speed hastened.

He also continued keeping an eye on Little Fishy.

She had quickly adapted to the golden specks of light, and it didn’t take her long to capture her first speck of light and begin her construction. Soon, her construction speed caught up with Chu Feng’s and even overtook him.

The two of them were constructing the same building, though they didn’t know what the final product would be.

“C-C-Chu Feng!” a familiar voice echoed. It was Wang Qiang.

Chu Feng looked over and saw Xianhai Shaoyu standing next to Wang Qiang.

“Chu Feng, are these specks of light materials for our building?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

“Got it.”

Xianhai Shaoyu and Wang Qiang began adapting to the specks of light, though the two of them chose to venture in different directions. Xianhai Shaoyu made his way toward the golden specks of light, where his little sister was, whereas Wang Qiang headed in Chu Feng’s direction.

From their reactions, Chu Feng could tell that their ability to withstand the specks of light paled in comparison to him and Little Fishy, so he offered a warning to Wang Qiang, “The energy here is violent. Don’t step too deep in.”

“D-d-don’t worry. I can take it t-t-too. I-I-I have to take it! Do you know why?” Wang Qiang asked.

“Why?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s because we’re brothers. B-b-brothers must stay together! Even if I die, I’ll stay w-w-with you!” Wang Qiang said as he strutted into the black specks of light’s territory.

“B-b-bloody hell!” As soon as he walked in, he yelped in pain and retreated. “Brother, t-t-treat it as if I didn’t say anything. I-I-I’ll check out other places.”

Wang Qiang began making his way toward Xianhai Shaoyu.

Meanwhile, Xianhai Shaoyu had just arrived at the golden specks of light’s territory. He took a deep breath before walking in, and the immediate assault of excruciating pain warped his face. His usual refined demeanor disappeared without a trace.

“L-l-litter sister, is there any secret trick to this? Teach me,” Xianhai Shaoyu cried.

“No tricks. Endure,” Little Fishy coldly replied.

Xianhai Shaoyu refused to give up just like that. “You have already made such a h-h-huge progress in your construction. There must be a s-s-secret trick! Teach me!”

“B-B-Brother Shaoyu, don’t you think it’s mean for y-y-you to copy me?” Wang Qiang also arrived at the scene then.

“I’m not copying you! It’s too p-p-painful to speak properly,” Xianhai Shaoyu cried.

“I-i-is it that painful?” Wang Qiang stepped into the golden specks of light’s territory, only to retreat the next instant. He looked at Xianhai Shaoyu and said, “Brother Shaoyu, a true hero knows his own limits. You should learn from me.”

Wang Qiang made his way to the dark purple specks of light. It wasn’t as pure as the golden and black specks of light, but its energy was still formidable.

Xianhai Shaoyu was in a dilemma, not knowing whether he should continue trying or back down. He had wanted to go for the best as this was a rare fortuitous encounter, but upon seeing Wang Qiang going for a lesser option, he decided to give in and do the same too.

All of a sudden, he noticed something and stared at Wang Qiang in disbelief. “Wait a moment, you didn’t stutter at all when you lectured me earlier!”

Wang Qiang didn’t reply.

Xianhai Shaoyu stared at Wang Qiang with doubtful eyes before making his way toward the dark blue specks of light. The dark blue specks of light were weaker than the golden and black specks of light, but it was of the same rank as Wang Qiang’s dark purple specks of light. It was the second strongest energy here.

It didn’t take long for Xianhai Shaoyu to adapt to the dark blue specks of light.

With time, Yuwen Yanri, Ling Xiao, Feng Ling, Jie Baobao, Xian Miaomiao, and the others successfully withstood the pressure and entered the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation too. Even Long Muxi succeeded as well.

However, four people continued to struggle against the pressure. They were Long Chengyu, Qin Xuan, and the two prodigies from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion.

Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan had been stuck in the golden light for some time now—for some reason, the silhouettes in the golden light refused to step aside and grant them passage. As for the two from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion, they couldn’t even reach the golden light.

“Even Miss Long has gotten in. I’m starting to doubt myself,” Qin Xuan said in melancholy.

“What do you mean by that? Are you insinuating my big sister isn’t as talented as you?” Long Chengyu frowned.

“That’s not what I mean.” Qin Xuan shook his head. He looked at Long Chengyu, who was barely holding on and sweating profusely, and he suddenly burst into laughter. “I’m glad you’re here to accompany me.”

“Shit!” Long Chengyu cursed.
