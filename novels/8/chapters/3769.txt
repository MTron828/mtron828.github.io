Chapter 3769 - Deeply Worried

“Young lady, that place is a jail for prisoners. How are they dangerous?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

She felt very complicated.

On the one hand, she felt that Bai Liluo was not lying.

On the other hand, she felt that the people from the Blood-devouring Hall did not pose a threat.

Otherwise, why would the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master not do anything when she was torturing his grandson earlier?

Unless... he was plotting something.

“Prisoners? You imprisoned that monster?” asked Bai Liluo.

“Monster?”

Upon hearing her words, the crowd realized that something was amiss.

It was very possible that what Bai Liluo was indicating was not the people from the Blood-devouring Hall.

After all, although those people were dangerous, they could not be considered to be monsters. At the very least, they were not as dangerous as the monster Bai Liluo described.

“Big sister Liluo, are you indicating the thing inside that man?” Chu Feng pointed to the direction of the cell.

The person Chu Feng was indicating was the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s grandson.

“That person? I can only sense that monster, not people,” said Bai Liluo.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng came to a realization. As Bai Liluo was a Natural Oddity, she had a special sort of perception.

However, her perception was only effective towards special beings. She was unable to detect ordinary martial cultivators.

The place where the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master and the others were imprisoned was covered in a spirit formation that was capable of blocking one’s perception.

Although that spirit formation had blocked Bai Liluo’s perception of the people, it was unable to block her perception of the special existence there.

“Forget it, I’ll take a proper look myself.”

As Bai Liluo spoke, her gaze started to change. She looked at the entrance gate again. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, after Bai Liluo’s gaze changed, Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu’s expressions changed.

“That young lady?”

While Chu Feng was able to remain rather calm, Grandmaster Liangqiu revealed a look of astonishment.

Both Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu were able to detect that Bai Liluo was using a special perception ability.

She was using a world spirit technique. Through the ability Bai Liluo used, Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu were able to tell that Bai Liluo’s world spirit techniques were at the level of a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

Her world spirit techniques were on par with Grandmaster Liangqiu’s.

Thus, after Bai Liluo used her ability, the spirit formation around the prison that blocked one’s perception was immediately rendered useless.

At that moment, the situation inside the prison was fully visible to Bai Liluo.

“Little brother Chu Feng.”

“Did you also manage to detect that?”

After surveying the prison, Bai Liluo turned her gaze to Chu Feng.

“Big sister Liluo, it really is the thing inside that man’s head?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right. It is that thing," said Bai Liluo.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt some lingering fear.

The monster Bai Liluo spoke of was the poison within the grandson of the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

Earlier, Chu Feng had been in contact with that monster. Although he had realized that the poison was very strange, he had not expected it to be so dangerous.

Fortunately, Bai Liluo had come. Otherwise, perhaps no one would’ve discovered that such a dangerous thing was hidden in their Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Chu Feng, exactly what is going on here?”

Gu Mingyuan, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and others all looked to Chu Feng with curiosity.

Although he had come to understand what was going on, the others were still completely baffled.

Seeing that, Chu Feng began to roughly explain the situation to them.

“The grandson of the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master has a monster inside him?”

The crowd were all surprised upon hearing those words.

The person feeling the most surprised was Gu Mingyuan. After all, she had tortured the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s grandson earlier.

Furthermore, she was the one who had captured him and brought him there.

“Young lady, is that thing very difficult to handle?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

“It’s hard to tell. It’s still dormant. I can only determine its strength after it awakens.”

“However, it’s best to not take that risk. I am able to tell that that thing is very dangerous. The nefarious aura it emits is even stronger than that of the Black-feathered Specter. If it is to awaken, we will not be able to handle it, and will only be courting trouble for ourselves,” said Bai Liluo.

“Sssss~~~”

Hearing those words, even Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

When Bai Liluo said, that the nefarious aura it emitted was even stronger than that of the Black-feathered Specter, it had proved how dangerous it was.

After all, the Black-feathered Specter had just massacred the Tantai Heavenly Clan. What it had done was enough to raise people’s hackles.

An existence more nefarious than the Black-feathered Specter, one could imagine what sort of thing a being like that would do.

“Young lady, that monster is inside that man’s body, right?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

“More or less.” said Bai Liluo.

“In that case, if its host is killed, will it die?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

“Killed? It’s best that you do not infuriate it. The host’s mood will also affect that monster.” said Bai Liluo.

“This...”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and Grandmaster Liangqiu subconsciously took a glance at Gu Mingyuan.

Gu Mingyuan was slightly embarrassed after feeling their gazes.

After all, what she had done earlier was not only a simple action of infuriating the host.

It could be said that what she did earlier had been extremely dangerous.

“In that case, we can only release them." After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. “Lord Clan Chief, is that fine?”

“Let’s release them.” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded.

No one voiced any objection to this decision. Even Gu Mingyuan didn’t voice any objections.

Logically, as the people from the Blood-devouring Hall had come with the intention to kill them, it was already showing great mercy to allow them to live. Releasing them should be impossible.

However, due to that monster, they could only choose to release them. After all, they could not provoke the grandson of the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

Even though the grandson was merely the host of that monster, Bai Liluo had said that if the host was provoked, that monster could be affected too.

Thus, killing the host would be impossible. The only choice would be to release him.

After making their decision, Chu Feng and the others really ended up releasing the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master, the experts and, naturally, the grandson of the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

Of course, they couldn’t possibly release them just like that. Chu Feng and the others deliberately put on a show for them.

They made the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master and others think that it was Chu Feng who had tried his hardest to urge Gu Mingyuan and the others to agree to spare them.

Furthermore, before releasing them, Chu Feng put forth a demand.

That is, after being released, he wanted the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master to take his subordinates and his grandson with him and leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield, never to return, and never to willfully slaughter the innocent in the other starfield they settled in.

The Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master and experts did not anticipate that they would be able to come out alive.

Thus, they naturally agreed to Chu Feng’s demand without any hesitation.

Furthermore, they were not putting up a pretense. Instead, they were extremely earnest. They were even filled with gratitude and remorse when they agreed to Chu Feng’s demand.

Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan had both experienced what sort of individual the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master was.

Although he could be considered to be a sinner covered in the blood of countless innocent people, he was also someone who valued loyalty and honor.

Thus, since he had agreed to his demand, Chu Feng felt that he would most likely be able to keep it.

Just like that, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master left the Chu Heavenly Clan with his subordinates and grandson.

However, after the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master left, Chu Feng became deeply worried.

“Chu Feng, what did you tell the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master in your voice transmission earlier?” asked Gu Mingyuan.

They all knew that Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master had talked about some things using voice transmission.

The worry that Chu Feng showed at that moment was most definitely related to what he had talked about with the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master.

“I think I know where that monster came from,” said Chu Feng.

“Ah?”

The crowd were all shaken upon hearing those words.

They also wanted to know about the origin of that monster.

Merely, after seeing Chu Feng’s reaction, they realized that the monster’s origin was no small matter.

It was very possible that that origin concerned their fate.
