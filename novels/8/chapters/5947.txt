Chapter 5948: Reinforcement

Both the sealing formation and detection formation were channeled by this white-robed person. He was also the one who spoke up earlier to lure Chu Feng and Little Fishy out.

“Gather your men,” the mysterious white-robed man told the Netherworld Marshall.

“You can’t find them?” the Netherworld Marshall asked.

“I’ll find them in another twelve hours’ time.”

“Continue searching then.”

“We might be far away from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s headquarters, but we’re still in the Immortal Sea Galaxy. Their reinforcements should be arriving soon after the huge commotion in Littlelight Upper Realm.”

“The experts of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan don’t know that we’re here and have left for the other galaxies searching for us. Whatever reinforcements they send here won’t pose a threat to us.”

“Don’t underestimate the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. They wouldn’t dispatch all of their experts. Normal reinforcements might not pose a threat to you, but what if it’s the clan chief or some old monster from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan? Are you confident in dealing with them?”

“What a joke. Do you think I’d fear them?” the Netherworld Marshall scoffed in disdain. He turned around and issued an order, “Activate the teleportation formation. Call everyone back.”

“I thought you don’t fear them?” the mysterious white-robed man asked.

“It’s better to be prepared than to be caught off guard.”

The Netherworld Generals rushed forward and released unique surges of energy to channel the teleportation formation. This teleportation formation could be accessed via all of the Netherworld Sect’s bases in Bluesnow Upper Realm.

All Netherworld Sectmembers were to enter the teleportation formation once it was activated.

So many Netherworld Sect’s experts were channeling the teleportation formation, but they still weren’t able to activate it.

“Master, you’re needed to control the formation,” the Netherworld Marshall said with a smile.

The white-robed man formed a hand seal and fused his spirit power into the teleportation formation. Only then did the teleportation formation finally activate.

“As expected of you. You can simultaneously channel three massive formations without a hitch,” the Netherworld Marshall complimented. “Master, are you sure you can find them within twelve hours?”

“Of course. However, there’s one thing I need to first clarify,” the white-robed man said.

“What is it?”

“I’ll find the person within twelve hours, but I won’t get involved if an old monster from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan arrives before then. I’ll leave right away, and I’d be happy to take you with me. However, you shouldn’t expect me to fight with you.”

“No problem.” The Netherworld Marshall nodded. “Is that person Chu Feng?”

“Chu Feng? What Chu Feng?” The white-robed man was confused.

“The person who saved Xianhai Yu’er.”

“Are you kidding right now?” The white-robed man glared at the Netherworld Marshall as if he had been humiliated.

“Master, I don’t mean any disrespect, but our scouts have only found Chu Feng’s trail in Bluesnow Upper Realm. None of our sources indicated that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan has dispatched someone here,” the Netherworld Marshall said.

“Your sources are unreliable. You’re underestimating the Immortal Sea Fish Clan if you think that you can grasp all their movements by slipping some spies in. Chu Feng can’t circumvent your defenses to rescue Xianhai Yu’er, and neither does he have the ability to circumvent my detection formation. It has to at least be a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist, and he must own some formidable treasure. It could be one of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s hidden powerhouses,” the white-robed man said.

“I heard rumors that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan has a powerful honorary elder. Supposing the news is true, does that mean that the honorary elder is in Bluesnow Upper Realm now?”

“The rumors are true, but the one who’s here isn’t him. That honorary elder has long reached rank nine True Dragon World Spiritist and is currently pushing for a breakthrough to Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist. I will never be able to find him within twelve hours.”

“How do you know that?”

The Netherworld Marshall tactfully chose not to probe deeper. “The waters in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan run deeper than I thought.”

“Before the emergence of the Ancient Clans, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was the only one who could fend against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” the white-robed man replied.

“What are you saying? What about our Netherworld Sect?” The Netherworld Marshall was displeased.

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion doesn’t have a grasp of what your Netherworld Sect is capable of.”

“That’s true.” The Netherworld Marshall nodded in satisfaction.

Netherworld Sectmembers started emerging from the activated teleportation formation. Soon, even Lord Nine Demons walked out of the teleportation formation too.

Coincidentally, Chen Hui, Song Yun, and the others also emerged from the teleportation formation.

When Lord Nine Demons saw Chen Hui, he quickly deduced that Song Yun had already caught wind of his movements. Given Song Yun’s wits, she would have figured out that he had resorted to underhanded tactics to issue the kill order on Chu Feng.

In truth, he had long known that Song Yun was on good terms with Chu Feng. He had intentionally asked that question to probe her. The fact that Song Yun was willing to shoulder the crime to protect Chu Feng further highlighted how close they were.

He hadn’t expected the two of them to be so close.

He knew that he had thoroughly offended Song Yun this time, but he wasn’t concerned as no one could walk out of the Demon Netherworld Tower alive. He didn’t say a word, but he directed a taunting smile toward Song Yun.

Much to his surprise, Song Yun greeted him with a polite bow and a sweet smile, “Paying respect to Lord Nine Demons.”

Lord Nine Demons was caught off guard. She doesn’t suspect me for the kill order I issued on Chu Feng?

...

Twelve hours passed in a flash.

All of the Netherworld Sectmembers were now gathered on this mountain peak. All in all, there were millions of them. The sea of red silhouettes was grand. It was rare for so many members of the elusive Netherworld Sect to be spotted in one place.

Weng!

The white-robed man suddenly formed a hand seal, and the teleportation formation expanded into an incomparably huge spirit formation gate. This spirit formation gate was reminiscent of a giant mirror face, reflecting the starry sky.

“Twelve hours is up. Why haven’t you found Xianhai Yu’er yet?” the Netherworld Marshall asked.

The white-robed man didn’t say a word. Instead, he continued channeling the detection formation with all his might. A complete map of Bluesnow Upper Realm surfaced from the detection formation, as layers of spirit power swiftly combed through the map.

Suddenly, the spirit power gushed toward a single region. It was where Chu Feng and Xianhai Yu’er were hiding.

“Found him!” the white-robed man said.

He waved his sleeves, and a spirit formation gate appeared. This spirit formation gate was linked to its sealing formation, and it allowed him to teleport to anywhere within the area of the sealing formation at a relatively fast speed.

The faces of the Netherworld Marshall and the others lit up.

The Netherworld Marshall and the white-robed man were just about to enter the spirit formation gate when the latter suddenly paused and looked at the sky. Beyond the sealing formation, he saw a humongous martial power palm descending from the sky.

Boom!

With a massive explosion, both the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s and Netherworld Sect’s sealing formations unraveled. Tremendous spirit power gushed down from the sky, bringing calamity upon the world.

Even the spirit formation gate opened by the white-robed man shattered as well.
