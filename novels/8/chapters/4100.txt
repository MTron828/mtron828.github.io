Chapter 4100 - I Am Long Daozhi

“Who are you? Do you dare voice your name?” the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master asked with a stern voice.

“Why wouldn’t I dare?”

That voice sounded again. Merely, this time around, that voice did not sound from an indistinct location.

Instead, it came from before Chu Feng.

Looking over, a figure was standing before Chu Feng.

Seeing this person, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were overjoyed.

The reason for that was because this person was the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s strongest individual, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

As for the people from the Purple Star Hall, they were somewhat confused. They did not recognize the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

While he didn’t know who his opponent was, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master did not dare to be careless. Thus, with a stern voice, he asked, “Who are you?”

“I am Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s Long Daozhi,” Long Daozhi declared his name.

“Heh...”

However, surprisingly, after learning Long Daozhi’s identity, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master actually revealed a smile.

He seemed to have eased up from the nervousness he had felt before, and was no longer acting that cautious.

“And here I was wondering who it was. So it was you.”

“I’ve actually heard of you already. I know you’re quite capable.”

“But, wasn’t your Ancestral Martial Dragon City never one to involve yourselves in anything? Why would you decide to meddle in other people’s business today?” asked the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

“Other people’s business?”

“You’re calling your bullying of the people from my Ancestral Martial Starfield other people’s business?” Long Daozhi refuted.

“That’s true.”

“However, I’d still urge you to consider carefully before acting.”

“If you are to truly fight me, things will not be that simple anymore.”

“Those who dared to attack me are all people that have committed a capital offense,” said the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

“Is that so?” Long Daozhi smiled faintly.

“Bang~~~”

Following that, the surrounding atmosphere changed. He had unleashed his oppressive might.

His oppressive might wreaked havoc as it enveloped heaven, earth and everyone present.

Everyone could sense the cultivation of this expert from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

He... was a rank six Utmost Exalted.

Rank six Utmost Exalted. This cultivation was comparable to the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

No one would’ve imagined that the Ancestral Martial Starfield deemed to be the weakest in all of the Holy Light Galaxy’s starfields would possess an expert of this caliber.

At the time when the majority of the crowd were shocked by Long Daozhi’s cultivation, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master shook his head.

There was no trace of caution on his face at all.

Compared to earlier, he was now completely relaxed.

The reason why he was afraid earlier was because he didn’t know who his foe was.

Upon learning of Long Daozhi’s identity, he had loosened up greatly.

After all, the status of the Ancestral Martial Starfield was already set in stone in his mind.

No matter how powerful Long Daozhi might be, since he was from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master would inevitably belittle him.

That said, he did not immediately attack Long Daozhi after learning his identity. Instead, he had spoken to threaten him.

The reason for that was because he had actually had some restraining fear.

The fear he had, originated from his uncertainty of Long Daozhi’s cultivation.

But now that he had discovered Long Daozhi’s cultivation to be equal to his, all of his restraining fear disappeared.

He felt that, with an equal cultivation, he would possess at least a ninety percent chance of victory.

After all, he was the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master. He believed that the mysterious techniques and martial skills he had learned were most definitely not something that someone from an Abandoned Starfield could match.

“Truly never would I have expected that everyone from your Ancestral Martial Starfield would possess the same sort of ignorance of not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth.”

“Since you have refused the face that was given to you, do not blame me for being impolite.”

After saying those words, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master intended to attack.

However, to his surprise, Long Daozhi waved his sleeve and tossed an item into the sky.

That was a spheroid. It was completely golden in color, and seemed to be made from metal.

Once it was tossed into the sky, it immediately began expanding in size. Soon, it turned into a colossus tens of thousands of meters long.

That item was a seal. It seemed like a fort. At its center was a spirit formation gate, which was the entrance to that item.

Chu Feng noticed that the golden colossus’s surface was covered in runes and symbols. Seeing that, he knew that it was a treasure created through world spirit techniques.

Seeing that treasure, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master’s gaze changed somewhat.

He was able to tell what the usage of that treasure was.

It was most likely a treasure specialized for duels.

It might be able to withstand the battle power of rank six Utmost Exalted. It went without saying how valuable of a treasure it was.

Even his Purple Star Hall did not possess a treasure like that.

“Our battle shouldn’t involve other people. If you want to fight, then follow me.”

As the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master spoke, he turned around and leapt into that treasure.

Seeing that, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master let out a cold snort and followed Long Daozhi into the treasure.

“Buzz~~~”

Right after the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master entered, the runes and symbols on the surface of the treasure began to radiate dazzling light.

Even the treasure itself began to tremble violently.

The trembling was so powerful that the surrounding space was being affected by it.

Furthermore, energy ripples were being emitted from the treasure.

Even though the energy ripples were very weak, it still made the crowd realize what was going on.

That treasure seemed to be having difficulty containing the battle.

Because of this, many people revealed uneasy looks on their faces. Some of the more cowardly individuals immediately escaped from this place.

They all felt that it was very possible for the treasure to be unable to withstand a battle between two rank six Utmost Exalted.

If that treasure were to burst apart, the oppressive might and martial power wreaking havoc inside it would impact everyone present, bringing forth a calamity upon all of them.

“Buzz~~~”

However, at the time when the crowd were feeling worried, the light from the treasure began to dissipate.

Then, a figure shot out from the spirit formation entrance.

With the speed that figure was flying at, he would definitely be seriously injured upon impact with the ground.

That said, that figure managed to stabilize his body right before he reached the ground.

That said, when the crowd managed to clearly see who this person was, they were all unable to keep their calm.

This person was the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

Merely, the current Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master looked terrible.

Not only was there blood at the corner of his mouth, but his body was also covered in stab wounds.

Furthermore, his right arm had disappeared.

A large amount of blood was flowing from his severed arm.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, something else flew out from the treasure.

It was an arm. Furthermore, that arm was holding an Incomplete Exalted Armament.

That was the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master’s severed arm.

“Seems like the Purple Star Hall is nothing much either.”

“The Lower Starfields are nothing much either.”

At the time when the crowd were still shocked, a voice sounded from the sky.

It was Long Daozhi.

Long Daozhi slowly descended from the sky, and landed before Chu Feng.

Seeing Long Daozhi, the others and even Chu Feng felt surprised.

Long Daozhi had not even fought the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master long enough to finish half a cup of tea.

Yet, the battle was determined in such a short period of time.

This meant that even though they were both rank six Utmost Exalted, there was an enormous disparity in their strengths.

Long Daozhi’s strength far surpassed that of the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

Not only was the Purple Star Hall’s Hall master battered and exhausted, but he also had a look of unwillingness on his face. Yet, he did not dare to voice any complaints.

From his flickering eyes, one could see that he had begun to fear Long Daozhi.

The Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master flicked his wrist and grabbed. With that, the severed limb flew toward him.

He was not only planning to retrieve his weapon, but he also wanted to retrieve his lost limb.

“Paa~~~”

However, right after the severed arm started flying toward him, a foot stomped it to the ground.

It was Long Daozhi.

Long Daozhi’s stomp crushed the severed arm into two pieces.

“You...”

Anger filled the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master’s face when he saw that.

Humiliation. That was an enormous humiliation toward him.

“What do you want to say?” Long Daozhi asked with a sneer. Contempt filled his eyes as he looked to the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

It was a gaze of someone completely disregarding another person.

“Long Daozhi, don’t you act too excessive here!” the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master shouted angrily.

“Excessive?”

Long Daozhi narrowed his brows and released his overwhelming killing intent.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

The experts from the Purple Star Hall all grabbed their heads and began to roll on the ground while screaming in pain. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone beside the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master was acting this way. Even Li Mengyue was affected.

This was caused by oppressive might. Long Daozhi’s oppressive might was attacking everyone from the Purple Star Hall.

Then, Long Daozhi turned his gaze back to the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

Merely, his eyes were no longer filled with contempt. Instead, they were now filled with anger.

“The person who went back on their word is you. The person who tried to bully others with your strength is you.”

“Yet now, you’re saying that I’m being excessive?”

“Let me tell you this: not only am I not being excessive by teaching you a lesson, but even if I were to wipe out your entire Purple Star Hall, no one would dare say that I acted excessively!” Long Daozhi shouted.
