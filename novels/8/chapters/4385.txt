Chapter 4385: Deep Grudge

Upon seeing the person who appeared, looks of joy appeared on the faces of many of the spectators.

In contrast, a tight frown appeared on the forehead of the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster.

All of them recognized the person who had just arrived through the formation gate—Liu Shangwu.

“To think that it’s Liu Shangwu. No wonder. I was still wondering who would be so gutsy as to challenge the Death Dominion, but it turns out to be him.”

“Looks like we have a show ahead of us!”

Most of them were excited by the arrival of Liu Shangwu.

Liu Shangwu was not only a person who had successfully cleared the Death Dominion, previously, when the Sagacious Grandmaster held this world spiritist tournament elsewhere, he was also the one who defeated all of the competitors and emerged as the final champion.

Zhao Xuanhe was powerful, but Liu Shangwu was not lacking either.

It would surely be an exciting fight between the two of them, and it was such a battle that really sent one’s blood pumping.

Weng!

But shortly after, the formation gate shuddered once more, and yet another person appeared—Chu Feng.

“Who is this guy?”

“Did he successfully clear the Death Dominion too? Or did he just follow Liu Shangwu and bypassed the obstacles with his help?”

Chu Feng’s appearance had surprised the crowd, such that many of them started to assess him from head to toe. After all, this was an unfamiliar face to them.

They knew just how difficult the Death Dominion was, so they couldn’t help but doubt whether Chu Feng had really cleared the trial with his own ability. Many of them wondered if it was Liu Shangwu who had brought him all the way here.

Due to most eyes being focused on Chu Feng, none of them realized that the Sagacious Grandmaster was looking at Chu Feng with a deep, meaningful gaze.

“Brother Chu Feng, you were able to catch up so quickly! Did you manage to get that treasure?” Liu Shangwu asked in delight.

“Yes, I managed to obtain it,” Chu Feng replied.

“That’s a relief!” Liu Shangwu replied as he patted Chu Feng’s shoulders.

They might have been shallow acquaintances, but Liu Shangwu was a person who was extremely warm-hearted. Furthermore, he was already convinced that Chu Feng’s mastery of world spiritist techniques had already surpassed him, which added another layer of admiration toward his impression of Chu Feng.

“Are the two of you my competitor? Are we going one by one, or are the two of you going to come at me together?” a voice suddenly sounded.

It was Zhao Xuanhe.

Zhao Xuanhe had a haughty personality, which could be clearly heard just from the tone of his voice.

It formed a stark contrast to the ‘righteous sect’ image that the Soaring Flower Gazebo feigned on the surface, but as it turned out, no one that was present was surprised to hear those words coming from him at all.

From the looks of it, it would be safe to assume that Zhao Xuanhe had always been such a person.

“Brother Chu Feng, will you allow me to go first?” Liu Shangwu turned to Chu Feng and asked. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Sure, go ahead,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

So, Liu Shangwu got onto the dueling ring first.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng looked through the crowd and saw the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster. He noticed that the gaze of the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster was following Liu Shangwu as he got onto the dueling ring.

“Looks like they still don’t know about me stealing their treasure,” Chu Feng deduced.

Otherwise, the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster would have been looking at him with a hint of fury in his eyes.

“Zhao Xuanhe, let’s stake something on the battle,” Liu Shangwu suddenly proposed after getting onto the dueling ring.

“Stake something?”

Liu Shangwu’s words induced the curiosity of the crowd.

“What do you intend to stake?” Zhao Xuanhe asked.

“If I win, I’ll dig out your eyes and sever your limbs personally,” Liu Shangwu said.

“Ah? Why would it... be such a bet?”

“That’s way too cruel! Is there some kind of deeper grudge between them?”

Liu Shangwu’s words caused a huge commotion to break out amidst the crowd.

At the same time, Chu Feng’s heart rippled a little too.

If someone as gentle as Liu Shangwu was saying such words, it could only mean one thing—Chu Feng’s earlier guess was spot-on.

There must be some kind of grudge between the two of them, and a particularly deep one at that.

“It’s just as what all of you are thinking. There’s a deep grudge between me and Zhao Xuanhe,” Liu Shangwu turned to the crowd and said.

“Zhao Xuanhe is a hypocrite. He dresses in fine clothing and puts on a righteous face, but all he commits all sorts of vile deeds in the shadows! My cousin, Liu Yu, a 19-year-old lady, has great talents as a world spiritist. She happened to meet Zhao Xuanhe out of coincidence, and she thought of him as a close friend. Yet, who could have thought that Zhao Xuanhe would actually do something inhuman to her...”

Speaking up to this point, Liu Shangwu’s body began trembling in agitation. His rage flurried like the volcano, such that everyone could feel the extent of his rage just from the aura he was emanating.

Everyone present in the room stood silently on the spot, waiting for Liu Shangwu to finish his story. They were also curious to know just what did Liu Shangwu’s cousin go through.

“That beast, Zhao Xuanhe, forced himself on my cousin. My cousin tried to retaliate and scratched his face in the midst of doing so, so he dug out my cousin’s eyeballs and severed her arms and legs.

“Not only so, he even threw my cousin into a cauldron and tried to assimilate her using cruel means. If not for someone discovering it, my cousin wouldn’t have been around anymore!”

Speaking up to this point, the rage that Liu Shangwu emanated turned into concentrated killing intent. The hatred in his eyes was sharp like daggers.

In that instant, a huge uproar broke out in the room. Many people found the story unbelievable, and most of them carried a skeptical view toward it.

However, Chu Feng knew that the story was likely to be true.

Liu Shangwu didn’t look like the type to lie, and he knew that true face of the Soaring Flower Gazebo too. It wasn’t beyond them to commit such atrocities.

It was a daily affair in the Soaring Flower Gazebo to turn human children into pills so as to nourish their own disciples.

“Liu Shangwu, I don’t know you or your cousin at all. If you wish to defeat me, you can do so with your capabilities. Why must you slander my reputation with such lies? Did you think that you can affect my state of mind through this?

“I must say that you’re underestimating me, Zhao Xuanhe, as well as all of the elders gathered here. I believe that they have the ability to judge for themselves just what kind of person I, Zhao Xuanhe, am!”

Zhao Xuanhe looked at Liu Shangwu with a cold sneer on his face.

He didn’t admit to those accusations, and instead, he tried to turn the tables on Liu Shangwu even.

What was even more hateful was that many people present in the room swiftly voiced out their support for Zhao Xuanhe.

In other words, they believed that Liu Shangwu was lying.

However, it appeared that Liu Shangwu had already expected such a situation, so he didn’t lose his cool as a result of this. Nevertheless, the killing intent in his eyes still remained unabated.
