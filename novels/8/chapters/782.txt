MGA: Chapter 783 - Unpredictable Outcome

“Too arrogant.” You Tonghan couldn’t endure Murong Xun’s conceited attitude any longer. Before Xuan Xiaochao even made his move, You Tonghan attacked first.

*boom*

He leapt forward as the aura of a rank eight Martial Lord radiated from his body like a heatwave. It swirled about in the sky while the surrounding space instantly twisted around him. At the same time, he was akin to a furious tiger as he lashed at Murong Xun with ferocious attacks.

“You’ve come at the perfect moment.” Murong Xun roared with laughter as he faced You Tonghan’s attacks; he wasn’t the slightest bit afraid.

As You Tonghan drew near, he clenched his fist and threw a punch at the oncoming attacks. Instantly, the winds and clouds surged about; Murong Xun fully revealed the destructive might of a Martial Lord.

The boundless Martial power was like an enormous wave travelling through the air. It unceasingly surged towards You Tonghan as it rolled ahead.

You Tonghan did not reveal any weakness either. Similarly, he also released his Martial power and threw out a punch. A huge explosion resounded out, releasing a berserk shockwave that flared out like fireworks, and devastated the surrounding area.

The confrontation of the two fists revealed a display of extraordinary might. Those who were watching burst with excitement, and some even cheered on, as if they were truly watching an entertaining spectacle—one that could not be seen in countless years!

“The fighting strength of this Murong Xun is very strong. I’m afraid even normal rank nine Martial Lords would be unable to defeat him. However, You Tonghan and Xuan Xiaochao are the same: they are a bit inferior to Murong Xun. In a one-on-one fight, You Tonghan will most likely lose.”

Although, on the surface, it appeared there were no differences between the two punches, Chu Feng discovered that You Tonghan was slightly weaker with his Heaven’s Eyes.

“Haha! It seems you’ve got a bit of skill; however, it is simply insufficient.” After the exchange, Murong Xun continued roaring with laughter, and fully displayed his arrogant nature. Right after, he slightly narrowed his eyes towards Xuan Xiaochao and Fu Fengming, and provoked them by saying, “You two, come as well! Otherwise, he alone will not be enough.”

“Murong Xun, you are too haughty...” Hearing his words, Xuan Xiaochao, who was standing on the side, looking at the fight, was so angry his sharp brows slanted inwards as he gritted his teeth. His expression looked like he wanted to tear Murong Xun apart.

He knew that Murong Xun was really stooping low.

Although on the surface, Murong Xun was provoking them, in reality, Murong Xun was threatening Xuan Xiaochao and Fu Fengming not to interfere.

If they did, then that would mean they thought they’d be unable to defeat Murong Xun alone and required the assistance of the others. With that, not only would the three of them lose face, even the entire Crippling Night Demon Sect would as well.

However, Xuan Xiaochao and Fu Fengming were not fools. They knew if they didn’t interfere, then You Tonghan would suffer, sooner or later. And, with what they knew about Murong Xun, You Tonghan would possibly greatly suffer.

“Everyone, I thank you all for coming from far distances to this place. However, I’d advise if you want to observe, stay a bit away because you may be affected if you’re too close. After all... this is war!”

Just at that moment, Fu Fengming spoke. He first clasped his hands at the people around, then his gaze turned fierce, and he shouted, “Members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, attention! The insolent Immortal Execution Archipelago has forgotten when they served our Crippling Night Demon Sect, and now, they dare to challenge us!

“Today, let us show the might of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, and let the world know, with the filthy blood of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, who is the strongest in the Eastern Sea Region!

“KILL THEM ALL!” Suddenly, Fu Fengming pointed at the experts of the Immortal Execution Archipelago and shouted. Then, he rushed towards Murong Xun, joining into the ring of battle between him and You Tonghan.

“Kill them! Let the Immortal Execution Archipelago know they are nothing before the Crippling Night Demon Sect!” At the same time, the over two thousand experts of the Crippling Night Demon Sect all emanated their vast might, and started fighting the experts of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.

The fires of battle instantly flew all about, shock waves bursting out incessantly. The sky and the earth was engulfed in battle, and looking at it from a distant, it was near impossible to determine who was who within the berserk shock waves. One could only see an exchange of ferocious attacks.

When Xuan Xiaochao saw this, he didn’t hesitate either and also joined the circle of battle. He joined hands with You Tonghan and Fu Fengming in attacking Murong Xun.

“This Fu Fengming is indeed intelligent.” Chu Feng, who was underground, also gazed at that scene. He had to admit that Fu Fengming’s move was quite brilliant.

Originally, due to the pressure of the observers—feeling shame if they were to attack Murong Xun unfairly—they did not dare to join hands and strike. However, due to a few simple words, Fu Fengming turned the single one-on-one into a battlefield, pulling the entire sky and earth into chaos.

In the eyes of the outsiders, other than Gold-cloak World Spiritists, those who could see through the horrifying shock waves were likely only people like Chu Feng who had the Heaven’s Eyes. Only they could see that Fu Fengming and the others were handling Murong Xun together.

So, even though it was an unfair battle, outsiders could not tell that. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Big Brother, the Immortal Execution Archipelago has entered the trap! It looks like we don’t need to activate that place to defeat them completely! How about we rush out and enter the battle as well?”

“Yeah! Big Brother, we really do want to take care of the dogs from the Immortal Execution Archipelago. In this period of time when the Crippling Night Demon Sect was in fragments, they have been too arrogant. The brothers that have been scattered around were bullied too much by them. Today, is it our best chance for revenge.”

“That’s right! They are truly seeing themselves as the overlord of the Eastern Sea Region! I really want to personally give them a lesson.” Seeing the Immortal Execution Archipelago entering a disadvantageous state, the blood of the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s experts hidden underground boiled with excitement. They couldn’t hold themselves from showing their skills.

“Big Brother, it is better to follow the plan. As long as we successfully open that place, then the Immortal Execution Archipelago will definitely be defeated. Giving them a lesson then would not be too late.”

However, just as a large portion of people wanted to go out and join the battle, Seventh Brother spoke to urge otherwise.

“This...” Old Liu entered a predicament as he heard his brothers’ urge and looked at the crowd’s battle-eager gazes.

As the old subordinate of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, he too was full of fighting spirit. How could he not want to go out right now and take care of the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago?

However, as the leader here, he could not be careless. After all, taking a single incorrect step would mean he would lose completely. Those here would also die because of his mistake.

“Old Liu, no matter if you believe me or not, from the information I’ve obtained, I heard that the people above are not everyone from the Immortal Execution Archipelago. It is best to not be too hasty.”

Seeing that Old Liu and the others had an absolute trump card, Chu Feng gave them some advice as well. He didn’t want them to waste that trump card and risk their lives outside. After all, it was always better to walk the safer route.

“Oh? My friend, Wuqing, what else do you know? There’s no harm in speaking your mind.” Hearing his words, Old Liu turned his head around and asked seriously. After the prior events, he now trusted Chu Feng completely.

“I’ve heard that other than the group of experts and Murong Xun, of the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s well-known Nine Immortals, two have come. However, they have yet to show themselves,” replied Chu Feng truthfully.

“What? Is that true?!” Not to mention Old Liu, even the others changed their faces greatly when they heard those words. On their formerly excited faces, uneasiness instantly emerged.
