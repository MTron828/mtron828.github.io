Chapter 4858: Netherworld Sect

Chu Feng had never met the Netherworld Envoys before, but he had heard of them. They were a bunch of mysterious but incredibly powerful cultivators.

They had a custom of planting terrifying monsters into the bodies of children that possessed superior cultivation talent. Those monsters would turn those talented children into fools with time.

The grandson of the Blood-Devouring Hall’s Hall Master had fallen prey to their means.

For that, the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master had gone around searching for the whereabouts of the Netherworld Envoy and found them twice. It was just that he wasn’t a match for the Netherworld Envoys at all.

His audacity for daring to challenge the Netherworld Envoys should have led to his death, but upon learning that his grandson had fallen prey to them, the Netherworld Envoys surprisingly spared him.

Song Yun had also fallen prey to the Netherworld Envoys too. Based on what she said, if not for a rare medicine she obtained, she would have already become a fool by now.

So far, there were no known means to deal with those monsters once they had been planted into a person’s body.

No one knew what the Netherworld Envoys’ real goal was, but they were indeed a fearsome bunch of people considering what they were doing. It was likely that they were from a vile organization.

“Go on,” Chu Feng said.

“G-go on with what? I’ve already told you everything I know!” Shengguang Yunyue exclaimed, but her eyes were flickering around nervously.

“How could the Holy Light Clan know nothing about the Netherworld Envoys at all? I want you to spit out everything that you know!”

Chu Feng thought that it was impossible that the Holy Light Clan, as the overlords of the Holy Light Galaxy, would know nothing about the Netherworld Envoys. Shengguang Yunyue’s nervous response only further affirmed his guess.

“I-I really don’t know!”

Shengguang Yunyue was still refusing to speak. Chu Feng’s gaze slowly turned cold. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t force my hand.”

Chu Feng’s menacing gaze made Shengguang Yunyue recoil in horror.

“I-I’ll speak... Young hero Chu Feng, it’s not that I’m trying to keep things from you. Our Holy Light Clan did try to investigate the Netherworld Envoys, but we didn’t manage to uncover much,” Shengguang Yunyue said.

“Just tell me everything you know,” Chu Feng said.

So, Shengguang Yunyue started to divulge what she knew about the Netherworld Envoys.

The activities of the Netherworld Envoys weren’t just limited to the Holy Light Clan. There were sightings of them all over the world of cultivation.

The Holy Light Clan were far from the top, but their desire to exert complete dominance over the Holy Light Galaxy was extremely strong. Naturally, they wouldn’t allow an outsider like the Netherworld Envoys to fool around on their territory.

So, they dispatched a group of elites to hunt down the Netherworld Envoys many years back, only to swiftly lose touch with them.

One day, ten Netherworld Envoys suddenly appeared in the territory of the Holy Light Clan with a massive box. They opened the box and revealed the heads of the elites they had dispatched. One of them was even a grand elder.

They had all been killed by the Netherworld Envoys!

The Netherworld Envoys placed the box there and left without saying a word, but from then on, the Holy Light Clan no longer dared to pursue them anymore. It was not that they didn’t want to but they didn’t dare to.

The Netherworld Envoys were clearly a bunch not to be trifled with.

While the Netherworld Envoys never harmed any other members of the Holy Light Clan from that day on, the Holy Light Clan was still unable to rest at peace knowing that there was a huge threat lurking in their territory.

So, they tried to secretly investigate the affairs of the Netherworld Envoys, and it was then that they learned that the Netherworld Envoys operated all over the massive world of cultivation.

Putting aside the Holy Light Galaxy, the Netherworld Envoys were headaches for the other galaxies too. It was said that not even the powerful world spiritists of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were able to remove those monsters once they were planted into one’s body.

“Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion can’t remove those monsters?”

Chu Feng was shocked.

“I don’t know the details. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion looks down on our Holy Light Galaxy, so we couldn’t verify the rumors with them,” Shengguang Yunyue replied.

“The ones they look down on isn’t our galaxy but the Holy Light Clan,” Long Xiaoxiao remarked.

Those words made Shengguang Yunyue glare at Long Xiaoxiao, but she quickly backed down upon sensing Chu Feng’s sharp gaze.

“Even the Seven Realms Galaxy isn’t able to do anything about them?”

Chu Feng realized that the Netherworld Envoys were stronger than he had imagined.

The Seven Realms Sacred Manion was not just the overlord of the Seven Realms Galaxy. It was also a place of gathering for the most powerful world spiritists in the world of cultivation.

If they were unable to do anything about those monsters too, Chu Feng would really have to re-evaluate the threat of those Netherworld Envoys. The Netherworld Envoys could very well be a threat to the entire world of cultivation.

That would mean that they were adversaries whom Chu Feng couldn’t deal with at his current level.

“What other news do you have?” Chu Feng asked.

“The Netherworld Envoys come from an organization known as the Netherworld Sect,” Shengguang Yunyue said, only to quickly cover her mouth in regret.

“Young hero Chu Feng, regardless of whether you’re going to confront the Netherworld Envoys in the future or not, you mustn’t tell them that I was the one who provided you with the information. Otherwise, it could bring calamity upon the Holy Light Clan!

“I concede that I’m not a good person, but my clan members are innocent! I only know this much about them!” Shengugang Yunyue pleaded.

Chu Feng could understand her worries.

The Netherworld Envoys must have greatly traumatized the Holy Light Clan when they visited with the heads of their clan members and a grand elder back then.

“I won’t tell anyone that you were the one who conveyed this information to me,” Chu Feng harrumphed before putting Shengguang Yunyue back into the gourd.

He tried activating the ancient teleportation formation, but just as he had expected, it didn’t work. There was nothing wrong with the ancient teleportation formation; it was just that his destination, the Flowersea Ordinary Realm, no longer existed.

Knowing that it was impossible for him to obtain the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor’s heritage anymore, he looked into the boundless sky and sighed.

“Netherworld Sect, huh? I wonder what you all are up to.”
