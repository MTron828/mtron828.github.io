Chapter 5731: Is It a Coincidence?

“Big brother Chu Feng, I would have liked to expand my horizons at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, but I shan’t be a burden to you given my current condition,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Recuperate well. We shall travel this world of cultivation together once you regain your spirit power,” Chu Feng replied.

“I will work hard. I’ll accompany big brother Chu Feng to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and teach those arrogant things a lesson!” Bai Yunqing said.

He had been betrayed by his master, but he hadn’t been imprisoned, so he had heard about Chu Feng’s affairs. On the other hand, Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were still unaware of the matter, though they could tell from his words that a conflict had happened between Chu Feng and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

So, the two siblings asked at the same time,” What did the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion do?”

“Let’s get moving first. I’ll fill you in on the details along the way,” Chu Feng said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, this is where our Totem Dragon Clan’s sanctuary is located. Do drop by and visit us if you have time. We have to properly thank you for your help.”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief passed Chu Feng a token while forming several hand seals. Chu Feng would have to be recognized by the token for it to function, and the process had to be facilitated by the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

Chu Feng quickly reached out to grab the other side of the token, knowing that this was a symbol of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s trust in him.

He had fallen out with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but he didn’t have his father’s protection formation anymore and the Divine Deer had yet to recover. There might come a day when he needed to seek refuge, and the Totem Dragon Clan’s sanctuary would be a good place to head to.

Upon receiving the token’s recognition, it transformed into a stream of light and flowed into Chu Feng’s palm, forming an imprint on it. Through the token, Chu Feng learned the location of the sanctuary. He was surprised by the location.

It was the Spirit Beast Upper Realm of the Totem Dragon Clan’s True Dragon Starfield. Coincidentally, he had been there before.

That was where he hunted down and slaughtered the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Back then, Elder Song Yuwei feared that she would become a burden to him, so she was planning to bring Yue Ling and Monk Bitter Reminiscence to an ancient hidden spot in the Spirit Beast Upper Realm’s Golden Dragon Mountain Range.

In the ancient hidden spot, Chu Feng stumbled upon a mysterious woman who lived there. The mysterious woman was unfathomably powerful, and she possessed many formidable treasures. She even said that her master was acquainted with Qin Jiu, which meant that her master had to be from the Ancient Era.

It just so happened that the Totem Dragon Clan’s sanctuary was in the vicinity of that ancient hidden spot. Was it a coincidence? Probably not, but Chu Feng didn’t voice it aloud. He didn’t want the Totem Dragon Clan to know about that mysterious woman.

The group split ways.

Bai Yunqing followed the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others to their sanctuary in the Spirit Beast Upper Realm, while Chu Feng, Long Chengyu, and Long Muxi entered another teleportation formation.

Along the way, Chu Feng told them about his enmity with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“Holy! You are Elder Jie Ranqing’s son! No wonder! Were you the one who induced that phenomenon? My brother Chu Feng is incredible! It’s no wonder I can’t compete with you! Hahahaha…” Long Chengyu was overjoyed to hear that Chu Feng was Jie Ranqing’s son.

This provided a justification as to why he was unable to match Chu Feng.

In contrast, Long Muxi was more concerned about Chu Feng’s enmity with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“Chu Feng, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion refuses to acknowledge you even though you have induced such a phenomenon? They are still going after your life despite this?” Long Muxi asked.

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion doesn’t think much of me,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is too arrogant! Brother Chu Feng, don’t worry. We’re with you. We’ll slaughter our way into the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and force them to beg you for forgiveness on their knees with tears in their eyes!” Long Chengyu exclaimed.

“I don’t care how they see me. I only want my mother to be free. If they dare make my mother suffer, I won’t forgive them even if they beg for forgiveness on their knees,” Chu Feng replied.

“Of course! I, Long Chengyu, won’t forgive them either if they dare to mistreat Lord Jie Ranqing,” Long Chengyu said.

“Stop talking big. You should only say those words when you have the strength to back them up. How do you find the courage to say that when we have just lost our home?” Long Muxi glared at Long Chengyu.

“Big sister, our foundation is still intact. Our father is safe, and we are still around too. It’s only a matter of time before we regain control of the Totem Galaxy. By then, we’ll first settle things with the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect before helping Brother Chu Feng deal with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Long Chengyu replied cheerily.

He didn’t lose his heart over the recent revolt.

On the other hand, Long Muxi was still very concerned about the Totem Dragon Clan.

“Brother Chu Feng, aren’t we heading to Bloodline Galaxy? Why are we traveling within the same realm?” Long Chengyu asked.

“You’ll know soon enough. Ah, I suddenly remembered something,” Chu Feng said.

“What is it?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I previously helped Long Lin nurture the dragon essence. Out of gratitude, he gifted me one of your Totem Dragon Clan’s God Taboo Martial Skill. Is it fine for me to use it?” Chu Feng asked.

Even though he had already grasped the martial skill, he thought that he should still seek the Totem Dragon Clan’s permission out of respect for them. If they disapproved of it, he would just treat it as if he had never practiced it before.

“Brother Chu Feng, you are our savior. It goes without saying that you’re allowed to use our martial skills. If we hadn’t moved our treasures in advance, I’m sure my father would have imparted one of our God Taboo Martial Skills to you in person. Feel free and use it. No one will dare to blame you,” Long Chengyu said.

“I’ll be using it then,” Chu Feng said.

“Go ahead! May I ask what martial skill it is?” Long Chengyu asked out of curiosity.

“God Taboo: Dragon Breath,” Chu Feng replied.

“What?” Long Chengyu exclaimed in anger. “That Long Lin really isn’t a thing at all! Screw his grandmother!”

“You’re referring to rank one God Taboo Dragon Breath, right?” Long Muxi clarified.

“Indeed,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“That martial skill was created by one of our predecessors, but no one has successfully executed it before. Honestly, we only keep a record of it for the sake of it. Long Lin was clearly just messing with you when he handed that God Taboo Martial Skill to you,” Long Muxi said.
