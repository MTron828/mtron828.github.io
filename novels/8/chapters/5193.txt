Chapter 5193: Are Their Outcomes Worse Than Yours?

“What arrogance. What sect are you from?”

The man was infuriated by Chu Feng’s attitude, but he was hesitant to make a move out of fear of Chu Feng’s background.

“I don’t have a sect,” Chu Feng replied.

“Do you think I dare not make a move on you?” the man sneered.

“I told you that you can give it a try,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

“Putting on a brave front? I don’t buy that!”

The man unleashed his rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation spirit power and channeled it at Chu Feng.

“Heh…”

The spirit power gushed toward Chu Feng, but it suddenly dissipated right before it could hurt him. It turned out that Chu Feng had unleashed his own spirit power too.

“You!!!”

The man’s face warped in horror. He realized that Chu Feng was at rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation, making him a world spiritist far beyond his means to deal with.

Thus, the man immediately turned tail and fled.

Light shone under his feet, forming runes with each step he took. He had activated a movement formation that allowed him to move at a much faster speed than usual.

“Oof!”

He could barely take two steps before an anguished cry escaped from his mouth. He immediately pressed his hand against his face, but blood kept oozing out from the cracks between his fingers.

Chu Feng had secretly constructed a barrier behind the man.

The man had foolishly accelerated right into the barrier, causing him to ram his own face out of shape.

“Why are you running? Aren’t you going to take my rocks?” Chu Feng sneered.

At the same time, he used his spirit power to pull all of the blue rocks floating around the man over to his side.

“Y-you dare to steal from me? Do you know who I am?” the man bellowed in anger.

“Who are you?” Chu Feng asked.

“Return my rocks to me and I’ll let this matter slip. Otherwise, my parents definitely will not let you off!” the man threatened menacingly.

Despite his threat, the blood flowing down his face made him look more hilarious than intimidating.

“Who are your parents?” Chu Feng asked.

“You don’t need to know that, and you aren’t qualified to know either. Once my parents get involved in this, you’ll definitely regret crossing me. You’ll kneel down before me and beg me for mercy, but it’ll be too late then,” the man said.

“Some words of advice, you should learn how to be humble. Cultivate harder if you’re weak. Stop bringing trouble to your parents. If you didn’t try to steal my rocks, I wouldn’t have taken yours either. You reap what you sow.

“Even so, the conflict between us is nothing but a trifling matter. I suggest that you rein it in and stop troubling your parents over everything,” Chu Feng said.

With a wave of his sleeves, he dispelled the barrier and prepared to move on.

“A mere rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist dares to act so smugly! You’re merely a loser who preys on the weak. If a Situ World Spiritist Clansman stands before you instead of me, would you dare to take his rocks?” the man yelled indignantly.

“They would have suffered a fate far worse than you,” Chu Feng replied.

“What a big mouth you have. You’re telling me that you dare mess with a Situ World Spiritist Clansman?” the man asked.

“Why not?’ Chu Feng replied.

“If that’s the case, wait here for me then. I’ll get the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen over!” the man said.

“You know where they are?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course! I met them along the way,” the man replied.

“Sure, go on and call them. Make sure to move fast. I don’t have all day,” Chu Feng replied.

“Just you wait!”

The man began walking away, but he suddenly stopped halfway and turned to Chu Feng, saying, “Don’t run away if you’re a man.”

Chu Feng chuckled.

He pointed in a direction and said, “I don’t have time to waste with you, but I’ll be heading there. If you can really get the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen over, tell them to head in there to find me.”

“All right. I hope that you’ll at least show some guts.”

The man activated his movement formation and soon disappeared into the depths of the cavern. Chu Feng chuckled to himself before heading down the path he had pointed out earlier.

He wasn’t too bothered about this incident since he didn’t think that the man could actually bring the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen to him, but he didn’t lie about the direction he was heading toward. His intuition told him that there were more blue rocks and fewer people in that direction.

The direction where the man had headed off was probably where he had come from. The chances were likely that he had already harvested all of the blue rocks he had found along the way. Furthermore, if what he had said about meeting the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen earlier was true, the chances were likely that there was a crowd there.

Taking these into consideration, he decided to follow his intuition.

Chu Feng knew that it was unwise for him to rely solely on his Heaven’s Eyes for all matters, which was why he had focused on the cultivation of his mind and heart too. Over time, he was able to develop a sharp intuition for things.

While intuition might appear to be baseless deductions, they were actually based on accrued experience. This was one of the important things when it came to exploring ancient remnants.

It didn’t take long for Chu Feng to stumble upon blue rocks, and in large quantities too. In the blink of an eye, he had added yet another dozen blue rocks to his collection.

“Hm? He really managed to get them here?”

Chu Feng sensed that a large group of people was approaching.

Soon, a few hundred people appeared before their eyes.

Standing at the forefront were 33 young men wearing the robes of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. The others were probably spectators who heard the news and rushed over to watch the commotion.

Needless to say, the man from earlier on was amidst the crowd too.

“That’s the guy!” the man pointed to Chu Feng and said.

“Are you the one who dares talk bad about our Situ World Spiritist Clan?” one of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen asked furiously. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Despite his angry tone, his eyes betrayed his greed. Clearly, these people had only come here upon hearing that Chu Feng had a lot of blue rocks with him.

“Why aren’t you speaking? Where did your arrogance go?” the man hollered.

Emboldened by the presence of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen, his earlier cowardice had disappeared without a trace.

Chu Feng ignored the man and instead looked at Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.

“You’re all from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course! If you end your life right now, we’ll at least leave you with a whole corpse,” one of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen sneered.

“Heh…”

Chu Feng suddenly burst into laughter. He glanced at the man and said, “It looks like he didn’t tell you how strong I am when he called you over.”

The immediate stiffening of that Situ World Spiritist Clansman’s face proved that Chu Feng was right. The man hadn’t told the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen how strong Chu Feng was out of fear that they wouldn’t come over.

After all, these Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were all at early Martial Exalted level. Even the strongest one amongst them was only at rank three Martial Exalted level.

They wouldn’t stand a chance against a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist like Chu Feng.

“Does it matter how strong you are?”

The Situ World Spiritist Clansman finally lost his patience and exerted his rank three Martial Exalted level martial power on Chu Feng. He didn’t hold back in the least; he was planning to take Chu Feng’s life.

This was their first meeting, but the Situ World Spiritist Clansman was planning to take Chu Feng’s life after listening to the man’s one-sided story. This showed just how domineering they must have usually been.

Gahhh!

Astonishingly, the Situ World Spiritist Clansman suddenly cried in pain right after exerting his martial power.

The perplexed crowd quickly turned their eyes over, only to see Chu Feng piercing the Situ World Spiritist Clansman’s dantian with a spirit formation sword.

“This!!!”

Disbelief flashed across everyone’s eyes.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Chu Feng swiftly flitted around the place, and the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen fell one after another, letting out groans of pain. All of their dantians had been crushed.

The crowd was dumbstruck.

They thought that they would see the Situ World Spiritist Clan teaching Chu Feng a lesson, but the tables were turned on the Situ World Spiritist Clan instead.

After dealing with the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen, Chu Feng turned his attention toward the man.

“How is it? Are their fates worse than yours?” Chu Feng asked.

The man was so scared that he immediately turned around and ran away. However, his legs succumbed to fear and he fell flat on the ground. It took him a bit of scrambling before he managed to run away.

Chu Feng didn’t bother chasing him.

He didn’t know who that man was, but it was apparent that the man’s background was beneath that of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. He had crippled the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan today before so many onlookers, which meant that the Situ World Spiritist Clan would put him on their hit list.

Naturally, the Situ World Spiritist Clan wouldn’t let that man, who perpetrated this incident, get away scot-free either.

Chu Feng wasn’t bothered by it since he wasn’t afraid of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but the same couldn’t be said about that man.
