Chapter 5793: First in the Present Era

The Genesis Bloodline enveloping the realm converged on Chu Feng’s palm.

The realm shook intensely as if it would collapse on itself. All of the powers quickly activated their defensive means to protect their juniors.

While this commotion was happening, the same thought occurred in everyone’s mind as they intently eyed Chu Feng: This is Chu Feng, Jie Ranqing’s son.

They had been reluctant to recognize this foreign junior, as rumors were rumors, after all.

Yet, Chu Feng somehow conquered the Genesis Bloodline right after Jie Tianran’s failed attempt… This gave his accomplishment tremendous weight. No one could deny this momentous achievement.

Grar!

A massive silhouette suddenly surfaced within the roaring Genesis Bloodline. At the same time, the tremors in the surroundings intensified. Oceans raged, and mountains crumbled. The realm was swiftly changing under the tremors.

The Genesis Bloodline, which had been swiftly flowing into Chu Feng’s body, began slowing down.

“Jie Tianran.” Chu Feng turned toward the Seven Realms Sacred Manion’s Mansion Master. “Do you know what this is?”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master stared at Chu Feng, not replying to the question.

“You should have a guess by now, but let me confirm it for you. Yes, this is the energy hidden in the Bloodline Galaxy, the Genesis Bloodline. The Nine Heavens’ Zenith was held here because of it,” Chu Feng said.

“How are you certain of it?”

Several people sent voice transmissions to Chu Feng. They wanted to verify the matter but dared not to ask it aloud out of fear for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Chu Feng ignored those voice transmissions and instead kept his attention on his maternal grandfather, Jie Tianran. “The Genesis Bloodline is right here. Why aren’t you taking it? Does the huge Seven Realms Sacred Mansion not have a single person worthy of winning over the Genesis Bloodline? If so, what rights do you have to see outsiders as trash? You yourselves are trash too.”

The crowd turned their eyes to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, curious to see how they would respond. Anyone else who said those words would have been courting death, but it was different for Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was already sworn enemies with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, not to mention that he had proven that he had the qualification to say those words.

The crowd wanted to see how the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion intended to deal with this matter.

“Chu Feng, stop putting on an act. Why don’t you give in if you can’t hold on anymore? What’s the point of finding so many excuses?” an elder from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion said with a composed tone as if he had seen through everything.

“Indeed, Chu Feng should be at his limit, right?”

“Is he finding an excuse to cushion his imminent failure?”

The crowd thought that the words of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elder made sense. After all, Chu Feng’s absorption of the Genesis Bloodline had slowed significantly.

“Feigning ignorance?” the elder asked with a contemptuous smile. “You must think we’re blind. It’s clear to anyone with eyes that you’re reaching your limit, and you don’t have the strength to conquer the Genesis Bloodline.”

“Oh?” Chu Feng burst into laughter. “If that’s what you think, you should take a closer look.”

The golden runes on Chu Feng’s body glowed with greater luminescence and the rate at which the Genesis Bloodline flowed into his palm hastened by more than ten thousand times. At such speed, it only took a few moments for the Genesis Bloodline enveloping the realm to converge in Chu Feng’s hand.

Blue sky and white clouds returned to the realm, as everything reverted to normalcy. Yet, the crowd looked utterly shocked.

Chu Feng had tamed the Genesis Bloodline with ease, despite Jie Tianran and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion having failed just moments ago. They would have never believed this to be possible had they not witnessed it with their own eyes.

Was this the gap between them? But how could there be such a huge gap? Could there be a huge difference between prodigies too?

“Old man, why don’t you say the same words once more?” Chu Feng said.

The elder gritted his teeth and his face turned livid, but he dared not to look at Chu Feng anymore. There was nothing he could say to refute the latter’s words. He couldn’t even claim that the Genesis Bloodline was weaker than it appeared after Jie Tianran’s defeat, or else it would be slapping their own Mansion Master’s face.

This put him in a corner. He had no choice but to accept his humiliation.

“That child is formidable! He’s even more talented than Jie Ranqing!”

“Jie Tianran really made a misjudgment this time around. Chu Feng is not trash; he’s a prodigy the world has never seen before!”

The powerhouses dared not to say those words aloud, but they recognized Chu Feng’s talent to be at a level beyond their imagination.

Weng!

All of a sudden, there was a change in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s ranking board.

1: Chu Feng

2: Xianhai Yu’er

3: Xianhai Shaoyu

4: Feng Ling

5: Yuwen YanriVịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

6: Ling Xiao

7: Jie Baobao

8: Xian Miaomiao

9: Long Chengyu

10: Qin Xuan

…

There were over a hundred names in the ranking board, but the crowd was more focused on the topmost name—Chu Feng!

“Has the Nine Heavens’ Zenith ended? That’d explain why Chu Feng has that formation’s protection. He wasn’t lying when he said that the Genesis Bloodline’s appearance is related to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.”

The crowd gossiped.

No one doubted that Chu Feng was the strongest junior, ranking even above famed prodigies like Xianhai Yu’er and Xianhao Shaoyu, after seeing how he conquered the Genesis Bloodline. It was only right for him to take the champion seat.

Chu Feng, the son of Jie Ranqing, was indisputably the strongest junior in the present world of cultivation.
