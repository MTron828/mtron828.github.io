Chapter 5864: Long Xie’s Edict

Holding onto the token of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster sensed that it was no longer assimilated by the formation of the Ancient Era’s clans, which meant that they were in a safe position.

All of a sudden, there was a change in the protective formation.

The protective formation began to retract and disintegrate. A tiny portion of the protective formation’s energy was distributed to the formation cores in each realm, forming a smaller protective formation of their own.

These protective formations were still formidable, but they were weaker than the previous ones Chu Feng had reinforced. Nevertheless, it was already enough to protect the realms from the cultivators of the world.

Enemies could now enter the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, and the only safe sanctuaries were the places covered by the smaller protective formations.

At the same time, the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city was exposed too, allowing everyone to approach it.

But there shouldn’t have been such a change to the protective formation. The protective formation Chu Feng had expended his strength to reinforce shouldn’t have become like that. It was someone else’s intentional doing.

A voice echoed in the ears of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, “The intruders have been eliminated. The Ancestral Martial Galaxy is safe, but our protective formation needs to be channeled by treasures. We can’t empty ourselves protecting the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. This matter shall end like this.”

It was Lord Long Xie’s voice, a mysterious but powerful existence dwelling deep in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, as well as the sect’s true master. He had a high opinion of Chu Feng and Zi Ling back then, but he couldn’t nurture either of them due to several reasons. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Thus, he indirectly offered pointers to Zi Ling via the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, which was how Zi Ling grew so much within a short time.

“Milord, isn’t it our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s mission to protect the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked.

“I am already being merciful by protecting those weaklings who know naught but internal strife. They shouldn’t have been worthy of our protection. I concede their performance surprised me, but that’s all there is to it. A leopard doesn’t change its spot. If the protective formation is breached, I believe many wouldn’t hesitate to side with the Ancient Era’s clans,” Lord Long Xie said.

“I’ll heed milord’s arrangement. Milord, were you the one who eliminated those invaders?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked.

“I wasn’t the one who made the move, but that person is related to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect too,” Lord Long Xie replied.

That piqued the curiosity of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, but since Lord Long Xie didn’t divulge that person’s identity, she tactfully chose not to probe any deeper. Instead, she asked, “Milord, should we bring the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city into our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?”

“Lass, you’re becoming quite nosey.”

“I...” The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was put at a loss.

“Don’t worry, it won’t be easy to acquire the treasures inside the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. Only someone who is deserving can obtain the treasures inside. You shouldn’t worry too much about it,” Lord Long Xie replied.

“Thank you for your reminder. I was too greedy.” The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster hung her head in shame.

The treasures left behind by the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect had nothing to do with the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, yet she tried to hoard them. That would make her no different from those selfish clans. The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasures were a gift from the predecessors to them, and it ought to go to whoever’s deserving of them.

Following that, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster explained the situation to the Holy Master. She didn’t reveal the truth; she merely said that the protective formation had run out of energy and couldn’t envelop the entire Ancestral Martial Galaxy anymore.

But the good news was that the crisis was over. She didn’t know how it happened, but the invaders were dead.

They relayed this news to everyone in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy via the formation cores.

The people of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy were thankful to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for providing the protective formation, knowing that they would have been purged if not for it. They didn’t blame the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for retracting the protective formation. Instead, they were overjoyed that the crisis was over.

The more timid ones immediately hid in one of the realms with the protective formation, whereas the more daring ones went back to their usual lives.

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster brought Chu Feng and the others back to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Coincidentally, Chu Feng woke up shortly after returning to the sect.

“Big brother Chu Feng!”

As soon as Chu Feng opened his eyes, he felt a soft body pressing against his chest. He looked at the woman lying on his chest and rubbed her head with a smile.

“I’m fine, Zi Ling. I’m just exhausted from exerting myself too much,” Chu Feng explained.

“Let me take a look.” Zi Ling grabbed Chu Feng’s wrist and infused her spirit power into him to inspect his condition. Moments later, her heart was put at ease. “It looks like you’re really fine.”

“You finally believe me.” Chu Feng sat up. “Why did you bring me back into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?”

He could tell from the surroundings that he had returned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but they should have been at a critical phase of fending against the Ancient Era’s clans.

Zi Ling quickly explained the situation to Chu Feng, though her understanding of the situation was incomplete too, as Long Xie didn’t allow the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster to divulge his identity.

“The protective formation has run out of energy?” Chu Feng fell into deep thought.

He had previously taken control of the protective formation, so he knew how much energy was harnessed in it. It shouldn’t have run out of energy within such a short time.

“Zi Ling, is Chu Feng awake?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster spoke from outside the door.

“Ah, I nearly forgot! Master and the others are worried about you, but they chose to wait outside to not disturb your rest.” Zi Ling quickly got up and opened the door.

Outside the door were the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, Duan Liufeng, Xia Yan, and countless elders and disciples. Everyone was worried even though the sectmaster had already said that Chu Feng was fine.

“Lord Sectmaster.” Chu Feng followed Zi Ling over to the door and bowed to the sectmaster.

The sectmaster, Duan Liufeng, and the others heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing Chu Feng.

“It looks like he’s really fine,” the sectmaster said.

“Rest assured, Lord Sectmaster. I’m perfectly fine.” Chu Feng thumped his chest with a smile.

“That’s good to hear. Chu Feng, do you still have Wen Xue’s Life Soul?” the sectmaster asked.
