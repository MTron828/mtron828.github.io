Chapter 5220: My Mother is Jie Ranqing

Eggy proceeded to tell Chu Feng everything Taowu had told her.

She told him that Taowu was sealed here not to cleanse his vicious nature but to take out his Godsoul and pass it on to a fated individual and that she was the fated individual.

She told him how Taowu’s master was Lord Qin Jiu, the strongest world spiritist in the Ancient Era who was dubbed the World Spiritist Emperor.

She told him how Eggy’s elder, Lord Chi Yu, used to serve Lord Qin Jiu, and that Chu Feng’s Pulse Searching Method, which was none other than his Heaven’s Eyes, was created by him.

“In the end, Elder Taowu is the master of this land. It all makes sense now… He’s been testing me all this while.”

Chu Feng revealed a smile upon coming to a realization. His worry for Taowu had vanished, and now just thought that it was interesting how everything came together.

Heaven’s Eyes had always been one of Chu Feng’s most important abilities. He had been using it since his time at the Eastern Sea Region, and it had helped him obtain many fortuitous encounters. While Eggy was the one who imparted the ability to him, its true creator was Lord Qin Jiu.

He thought that it was a huge coincidence how Taowu turned out to be Lord Qin Jiu’s world spirit.

At the same time, he felt a deep respect for Lord Qin Jiu too. It was hard not to feel respect for someone like that.

“Elder Taowu also said that you have an extraordinary world spiritist bloodline. It’s the strongest world spiritist bloodline known as the Ruler’s Bloodline,” Eggy said.

“Ruler’s Bloodline?”

Chu Feng had always known that he had a powerful world spiritist bloodline, but he never knew the name of it. Ruler’s Bloodline did sound rather imposing, but for some reason, he found it extremely familiar.

Bam!

Chu Feng suddenly felt something exploding in his mind.

He finally remembered where he had heard the term ‘Ruler’s Bloodline’ from. It was from Xianhai Shaoyu!

Xianhai Shaoyu told him that there was a sudden flood of prodigies in the world of cultivation five hundred years ago. In that era, practically every clan and sect had a monstrously talented prodigy in their ranks.

Such a prodigy emerged from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion during that era too, and her name was Jie Ranqing.

Exactly how powerful was Jie Ranqing?

During that era filled with monstrously talented juniors, she was publicly acknowledged to be the strongest one of them all. In fact, there was a clear gap between her and the other prodigies. Before her, the other prodigies only looked ordinary in comparison.

Jie Ranqing was the very definition of overpowered in that era. Common limitations somehow didn’t seem to apply to her.

For example, it was well known that world spiritists could only contract a single spirit world, but Jie Ranqing simultaneously contracted all Seven Spiritual Worlds. She was also known to possess the strongest bloodline in the world, and it was known as the Ruler’s Bloodline.

“Eggy, are you certain that Elder Taowu said that my world spiritist bloodline is the Ruler’s Bloodline? How was he able to tell what my world spiritist bloodline is?” Chu Feng asked.

A series of different emotions flashed across his face, starting from relief to grimness, followed by solemnity, and finally, agitation. The answer to that question was extremely important to him.

“Your world spiritist bloodline activated back when you were deciphering the formation. Elder Taowu was able to tell from that that you possess the Ruler’s Bloodline, just that it hasn’t fully awakened. He seems to be quite knowledgeable about such matters, so I’d think that he can be trusted on this,” Eggy replied.

She looked at Chu Feng and noticed a huge fluctuation in his emotions. Anxious, she asked, “What’s wrong, Chu Feng?”

“I really… I really am her son!”

Chu Feng felt like his head had just exploded.

Jie Ranqing was the one person in the world who possessed the Ruler’s Bloodline, and he happened to have the Ruler’s Bloodline too. How could there be such a huge coincidence in the world?

The only logical explanation he could think of was that Jie Ranqing was his mother!

Xianhai Shaoyu had told him back then that Jie Ranqing was a person whom he deeply respected, and that he had been wanting to pay her a visit. It was just that Jie Ranqing had announced decades ago that she would be going into closed-door training, and she hadn’t come out of it since then.

Thinking about it, that was also roughly the time that Chu Feng was born.

Chu Feng felt as if gigantic waves were crashing down on his heart, leaving him unable to maintain his composure. His eyes even turned a little red out of sheer agitation.

Back then, when Xianhai Shaoyu first started sharing Jie Ranqing’s story with him, Chu Feng listened to it from the perspective of a bystander. But when Xianhai Shaoyu mentioned that Jie Ranqing had been imprisoned for decades, his emotions suddenly began running amok.

That was the first time that he suspected that Jie Ranqing might be his mother, though it was just a guess back then.

However, he was almost certain right now that Jie Ranqing was his mother. He was certain that his Ruler’s Bloodline was inherited from his mother.

“Chu Feng, what’s wrong? Talk to me!” Eggy urged.

She noticed that Chu Feng’s eyes had turned red, and that made her even more worried.

“Eggy, I think I know who my mother is,” Chu Feng said.

He grabbed Eggy’s shoulder and revealed a rare joyous smile.

While Chu Feng was someone who often smiled, he rarely showed such a beaming smile. His reddened eyes reflected his yearning for his kin.

“Is it Elder Jie Ranqing?” Eggy asked.

While she had been busy trying to assimilate the Asura God-Demon Stone, she was still aware of everything that Chu Feng had been through. Naturally, this meant that she had heard his conversation with Xianhai Shaoyu.

In fact, she, who knew everything about Chu Feng, had also wondered if Jie Ranqing was Chu Feng’s mother.

“Yes, Jie Ranqing is my mother. That has to be the case. There can’t be any mistake about it! How could there be any mistake when it’s the Ruler’s Bloodline we’re talking about here?” Chu Feng said with absolute confidence.

“You’ll have to work harder then, Chu Feng. Your mother was imprisoned despite her immense talent. You won’t be able to save her unless you become much more powerful than you currently are,” Eggy said with a smile.

“I’ll definitely save my mother. The Seven Realms Sacred Manion better have treated my mother kindly, or else I’ll make them disappear from the face of the world.”

A vicious glint could be seen in Chu Feng’s reddened eyes.

“I believe that you’ll be able to do it,” Eggy said.

She knew that these weren’t just empty talk. Chu Feng did have the talent and willpower to reach that height. He might still be weak at the moment, but given sufficient time, he would be able to reach the peak of the world of cultivation.

Many mountains had appeared in Chu Feng’s journey, but he had always been able to surmount them and trample them flat. Eggy knew that because she had witnessed all of it.

Chu Feng was still weak right now compared to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but that had been the case for many of the adversaries he had eventually overcome too.

Be it the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Hundred Refinement Ordinary Realm, or the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, which of those so-called powerhouses who had once looked down on him dare to make light of him now?

Eggy believed that a day would come when the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion could only look up to Chu Feng.

“There’s one more thing, Chu Feng. It’s possible that Lord Qin Jiu’s true legacy might be hidden in Yue Ling’s ancestral land,” Eggy said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy? Are you saying that Yue Ling’s ancestor has obtained Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy, but he wasn’t able to comprehend its true essence?” Chu Feng asked.

In truth, he already had such doubt in mind when he grasped the legacy left behind by Yue Ling’s ancestor.

“That’s what I suspect too. It’d be hard for ordinary world spiritists to fully comprehend Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy. We should return to Yue Ling’s ancestral land and comb the area. We might just be able to find Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy. You have already met Xue Ji anyway, and she appears to be doing well. You’re at least accountable to Yu Sha now,” Eggy replied.

“I’ll follow your orders, Milady Queen.”

Chu Feng set off to Yue Ling’s ancestral land.

As a matter of fact, he would still have to return there for Song Yuwei even if not for this conjecture.

While Chu Feng left the Demoncoffin Realm, Xue Ji was still patiently waiting in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm for the Demon Spirit King to finish his trial. When six hours was finally up, she returned to the hidden space.

There, she saw the Demon Spirit King sitting cross-legged on the floor. He was no longer howling in pain. His aura was still weak, but he had regained his usual air of dominance.

He was initially resting with his eyes closed, but he immediately opened his eyes upon sensing Xue Ji’s entry.

“You succeeded?”

Xue Ji looked at the Demon Spirit King in surprise.

“It’s all thanks to you, Xue Ji. It looks like heaven is really looking after me. It doesn’t want to separate us,” the Demon Spirit King said excitedly.

He felt like he had just taken a trip to hell, and there were several times that he thought that he would really die. It wasn’t easy for him to be reunited with Xue Ji. Compelled by his rush of emotions, he stood up and tried to hug Xue Ji.

However, Xue Ji immediately backed away, not allowing the Demon Spirit King to touch her.

“Remember what I told you. I’ll consider it if you reach peak True God level,” Xue Ji said.
