Chapter 5935: The Most Fearsome Evil Power

However, Chu Feng didn’t make a move as he sensed that something was amiss.

The Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s guild leader had said that she had reliable news that they spotted Netherworld Sectmembers in both of the realms, but one of them reflected zero Netherworld Sectmembers whereas the other one had millions.

This was too big of a difference.

If the Netherworld Sect was the one behind Little Fishy’s capture, they should have made thorough preparations beforehand and wouldn't have been exposed that easily. Something was off.

“Elder.” Chu Feng looked at a nearby old man.

He had been chatting with this old man along the way, and the latter was both friendly and a decently powerful individual within the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.

“What’s wrong, young friend Chu Feng?” the old man asked.

“Can you give me one of the items carrying the Netherworld Sect’s aura?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course.” the old man replied before passing a tattered red cloak over.

This was the cloak Netherworld Sectmembers often wore. There was a formation embedded on the cloak to better retain the unique scent of the Netherworld Sect.

“Elder, may I use the teleportation formation to enter Bluesnow Upper Realm?’ Chu Feng asked.

“You may, but young friend Chu Feng, the detection formation has already shown no signs of the Netherworld Sectmembers in the Bluesnow Upper Realm. Why are you still heading there?” the old man asked.

“Elder, the Netherworld Sect has run rampant in the world of cultivation for so long, but hardly anyone has managed to find their bases. This shows that they possess extraordinary means. I find it hard to believe that there’s such a strong contrast between the two Upper Realms. This doesn’t seem like the Netherworld Sect’s style of doing things.”

“You suspect that Littlelight Upper Realm is a trap, whereas the Netherworld Sect’s true forces are stationed in Bluesnow Upper Realm?”

“It’s just a guess, but I have no basis behind it.”

“Young friend Chu Feng, if you truly think that’s the case, isn’t it too dangerous for you to head there alone?”

The old man had to remain here, as per Xianhai Shiyue’s commands. He knew Xianhai Shiyue’s personality; she was unlikely to believe Chu Feng even if they reported this conjecture to her right now, not to mention Chu Feng had no evidence to back it up.

Given the current circumstances, Xianhai Shiyue was making the right call.

“Rest assured, elder, I have tricks up my sleeves. I’ll go scout the situation in Bluesnow Upper Realm. If I find anything amiss, I’ll return to request your help,” Chu Feng replied.

“All right. Take care, young hero Chu Feng,” the old man said.

Before Chu Feng made a move, he asked, “Elder, you should be able to contact Lord Shiyue via the formation, right?”

“Yes, I can,” the old man replied.

“Why don’t you inform Lord Shiyue of my conjecture? Even if she harbors her reservation, you can advise her to at least tread carefully.” Chu Feng was becoming more certain that Littlelight Upper Realm was a trap.

The old man hesitated. He knew Xianhai Shiyue well. The latter would likely shrug off his concerns and instead berate him for overthinking things.

“Elder, the lives of many Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen are at stake. There’s nothing wrong with taking extra caution,” Chu Feng persuaded him.

“All right.” The old man made up his mind.

He thought that being berated was a small price to pay compared to the ten million lives of his clansmen. He contacted Xianhai Shiyue via the formation and relayed Chu Feng’s conjecture to her.

“Help me thank young hero Chu Feng for his reminder. We’ll be careful. Also, those channeling the formations should stay put.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Chu Feng could tell from Xianhai Shiyue’s response that she didn’t believe his deduction, just that she was replying in a roundabout manner instead of strongly expressing her dissatisfaction like Long Mochuan previously did.

Her order for those channeling the formation to stay put proved that. Otherwise, she would have dispatched some people to enter Bluesnow Upper Realm with Chu Feng to scout the situation.

Thus, Chu Feng entered Bluesnow Upper Realm alone via the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s teleportation formation.

Bluesnow Upper Realm was covered in a layer of blue snow, which was why it was named as such. Chu Feng landed amid a snowfield.

Without any gestation, he constructed a detection formation.

He knew that if the Netherworld Sect was camping here, they would have likely enveloped the entire realm with a concealment formation before they arrived. That would have been the reason why their Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s detection formation failed to pick up anything.

However, the concealment formation shouldn’t work now that he was inside the realm. He should be able to pick up on the Netherworld Sectmembers with his detection formation now.

Once he completed his detection formation, he tossed the cloak containing the Netherworld Sect’s aura into it and began flying around the area. Of course, he made sure to disguise and conceal himself.

“Hm?” Chu Feng’s detection formation soon picked up on something. “There are Netherworld Sectmembers here!”

Chu Feng didn’t think that he was just lucky. Chances were that there were many Netherworld Sectmembers here, so his detection formation was bound to quickly pick up something.

Just then, he heard rumbles coming from the sky, in the direction of Littlelight Upper Realm. An intense battle must have broken out, or else the noises wouldn’t have reached this far.

“Is Littlelight Upper Realm really a trap? I hope they are safe and sound,” Chu Feng murmured.

He continued making his way toward the signal picked up by the detection formation.

Soon, he arrived before a city.

As he got closer, he noticed that someone had slaughtered everyone inside the city. There were carcasses everywhere, but there was surprisingly no blood to be seen. Most victims didn’t even have wounds on their bodies. They looked like their souls had been devoured instead.

At the center of the city were fifteen people. They were dressed peculiarly, wearing white bamboo hats and red cloaks bearing two black words—Netherworld Envoy. They were from the Netherworld Sect.

They were the culprits behind the massacre.

They were sitting together to construct a formation to gather all of the souls inside the city. Unfortunately, they had already assimilated all of the souls. Chu Feng was a step too late.

The Netherworld Envoy he had previously met didn’t seem to be a bad person; he wouldn’t have massacred the innocent. As obstinate as he was, he had his sense of justice.

In contrast, the people before him looked like a bunch of twisted cultists.

From this, he deduced that there might be diverging beliefs in the Netherworld Sect. It was no wonder why people said that the Netherworld Sect was the most fearsome malevolent power.
