Chapter 5554: A Dream?

The chief elder was taken aback by Chu Feng’s honesty, but he quickly snapped out of it and probed further, “Why do you wish to meet Lord Xianhai Yu’er? Are you interested in her because of the rumors about her beauty?”

“It’s something more important than that,” Chu Feng said.

“Speak,” the chief elder said.

“I know that my spirit power is still weak, but I have always had a unique take when it comes to formations. I can help Lord Xianhai Yu’er modify her formation armor,” Chu Feng said.

“That formation armor is no ordinary formation,” the chief elder replied with a smile.

The fact that he answered in such a manner after witnessing Chu Feng’s means showed how difficult it was to tamper with the formation armor.

“Elder, I’ll give my all for the Star Sea Realm if you grant me the chance,” Chu Feng said.

Instead of answering the question, the chief elder asked, “521, did you sense a power seeping into your body?”

“I did,” Chu Feng replied with a nod. “Did you sense it too?”

“Mm,” the chief elder replied with a nod. “It shouldn’t have been possible for someone of your level to sense it. You’re truly extraordinary. Very well, I’ll give you a chance then. I was going to get you to maintain the formation armor, but I’ll make an exception and assign you the role of a designer.”

The chief elder passed a token to Chu Feng before adding on, “521, you have to know that the formation armor is Xianhai Yu’er’s key to entering the Star Memorial Domain. While modifying it, you also have to ensure its completeness. I won’t be able to save you if a problem occurs as a result of your negligence.”

“Rest assured, elder. I’ll proceed carefully.” Chu Feng accepted the token with a heart filled with excitement.

He had come here to help Little Fishy, and he had finally obtained the opportunity to do so. However, he still wasn’t satisfied with the token in hand, so he asked, “Elder, will I… have a chance to meet Lord Xianhai Yu’er?”

“It won’t be easy. Lord Xianhai Yu’er doesn’t like to associate herself with males. She has only requested a female follower. That being said, you should have heard about the duel between Lord Xianhai Yu’er and Lord Jie Tian, right?” the chief elder asked.

“I heard that Lord Xianhai Yu’er lost the duel and sustained injuries,” Chu Feng replied.

“There was indeed a duel, but they didn’t directly cross blows or sustain any injuries as a result of it. It’s just a bet between the two of them,” the chief elder said.

The Star Memorial Domain was the most important place in the Star Sea Realm. It was usually not accessible to the formation entities, but for some reason, the traitors managed to find a way to slip in there.

Thus, the Star Realm needed Little Fishy and Jie Tian’s help to subdue them.

The two of them had cleared the trial, so they were able to enter the Star Memorial Domain as long as they wore the Star Sea Realm’s specially crafted formation armor. The Star Sea Realm entrusted them with the important job of entering the Star Memorial Domain and defeating the traitors while uncovering the secret of the Star Memorial Domain.

If possible, they would tap into the power of the Star Memorial Domain to clear away the evil power, thus returning peace to the Star Sea Realm.

Little Fishy and Jie Tian had already explored the Star Memorial Domain a little thus far, and they discovered new formation entities in its depths. These formation entities were monsters manifested from the realm’s great spirit power, and they hindered them from further exploring the Star Memorial Domain.

If they wished to advance further, they would have to work together to clear these monsters.

While dealing with the monsters, Jie Tian issued a challenge to Little Fishy as to which of them could clear more monsters. Little Fishy accepted the bet.

It would appear that Little Fishy lost the bet by a significant margin, however, which was why she was a little depressed when she returned. In any case, the truth wasn’t as exaggerated as the rumors and ten days had already passed since their bet.

It was just that City 19 was too closed off, which is why their news was late and inaccurate.

“We have previously told Xianhai Yu’er that we need to further decipher her bloodline to better tailor the formation armor to her needs, but she refused to share any details regarding that. Yet, after that duel, she took the initiative to provide us with information about her bloodline. Clearly, she’s concerned about the bet even though it was inconsequential. She is a very competitive person at heart.

“I have personally met Xianhai Yu’er, and she’s a bubbly and amicable person. If you can further decipher her bloodline and better tailor the formation armor to her needs, I believe she would be willing to meet you so as to personally thank you,” the chief elder said.

“I understand,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

The chief elder brought Chu Feng to the place where Little Fishy’s formation armor was being constructed. There was a chief engineer, nine normal engineers, and a hundred maintenance staff there.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Chu Feng’s position was a normal engineer, and his addition to the team increased the total number of normal engineers to ten. Even though he was just a normal engineer, he now had the right to request permission to modify the formation armor.

The team warmly welcomed him, partly because the chief elder had brought him over.

As soon as he stepped into the grounds, Chu Feng’s eyes were drawn to a massive armor spanning a height of over a hundred meters. It looked domineering, emanating tremendous spirit power. Inscribed on the armor were the words ‘Xianhai Yu’er’.

Clearly, this was the formation armor Little Fishy used to enter the Star Memorial Domain.

Beside the armor was an unfurled scroll detailing the traits of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s bloodline power.

Chu Feng could tell that the formation armor had just been modified in accordance with the traits detailed on the scroll.

“Elder, may I begin modifying the armor right away?” Chu Feng asked the chief elder.

Before the chief elder could answer the question, the chief engineer stepped forward and asked, “You want to modify the armor right away?”

“May I?” Chu Feng asked.

“Next time, Engineer 521. We have modified the formation armor based on the unique traits of Lord Xianhai Yu’er’s bloodline. She’ll be heading to the Star Memorial Domain tomorrow, so you won’t be able to make it in time if you begin modifying the armor now,” the chief engineer said.

“What time does she need the formation armor by?” Chu Feng asked.

“She needs it by daybreak,” the chief engineer replied.

The chief elder frowned. The sky was already darkening, and there were less than twelve hours before daybreak.

“521, why don’t you wait till Xianhai Yu’er returns from her next trip before modifying the armor?” the chief elder proposed.

“Elder, I can finish modifying the armor before daybreak,” Chu Feng replied.

As soon as those words were spoken, everyone in the vicinity turned their sights to Chu Feng, be it the maintenance staff or the elders. None of them said a word, but their eyes gleamed with skepticism. Some of them even revealed contemptuous smiles.

The chief engineer and his nine engineers took ten days to finish modifying the current armor, but a newcomer who knew nothing about the formation armor actually claimed that he could finish modifying it in just a couple of hours.

He was clearly dreaming!
