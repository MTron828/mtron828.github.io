Chapter 3726 - The Injured Old Daoist

“But senior, you clearly like and have feelings for senior Chu Xuanzhengfa,” said Chu Feng.

“So what if I do? It is one thing to like someone and have feelings for them, but it’s another thing to acknowledge and approve of that person.”

“I, Gu Mingyuan, would rather marry someone that I acknowledge than marry someone weaker than me that I like and have feelings for.” said Gu Mingyuan.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng no longer knew how to persuade Gu Mingyuan. He was able to tell that she was extremely determined.

Furthermore, he knew that this was a matter between Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa, While he could offer simple words of persuasion, he was unqualified to meddle in their business.

Thus, in an apologetic manner, Chu Feng said, “Senior, this junior was rude. I shouldn’t have said these things to senior.”

“It’s alright. I know that you’re only thinking for our and Lingxi’s sake.”

“That said, things like affection and feelings are truly not something that one can force one’s way with.”

“Take your father for example...”

Suddenly, Gu Mingyuan stopped talking. She forced a smile and shook her head.

Seeing that, Chu Feng realized something...

It was no wonder Gu Mingyuan was so nice to him. It seemed like she had special feelings for his father, even though it seemed like they did not have a close relationship at all.

Suddenly, Gu Mingyuan said to Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, promise me this. If something is to happen to me, you must protect Lingxi.”

“Senior, please rest assured. I will protect Lingxi with my life.” said Chu Feng.

“I am very assured. I’ve already seen you do it." Gu Mingyuan smiled in a very gratified manner.

......

Then, Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan chatted a bit more. However, they did not chat for too long, because it seemed like Gu Mingyuan was really in a rush to leave.

When Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa left, Chu Feng naturally had to see them off.

Even though he could not see them all the way to the teleportation formation, he needed to at least see them off with his eyes.

“Chu Lingxi!!!”

However, at the moment when Chu Lingxi and the others were about to leave, a voice sounded from within the palace that Chu Feng was training in.

That voice belonged to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“I will give you one final chance, are you really going to give up?”

“If you plan to give up, do not think of obtaining this old man’s help again for the rest of your life. Likewise, do not think about obtaining Divine Power for the rest of your life.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice sounded again. He knew that Chu Lingxi was planning to leave. Thus, the tone of his voice was slightly angry.

Hearing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice, Chu Feng felt a slight hint of sadness.

Although the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was someone who laughed and joked around a lot, someone who did not resemble a senior at all. Chu Feng knew very well that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been helping them in the past month and a half.

Chu Feng knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist thought very highly of Chu Lingxi. The reason why he asked her those questions was because he did not want her to leave.

Unfortunately, Chu Lingxi... was determined to leave.

“Senior, thank you for looking after me. Also, thank you for bringing my father and Chu Feng out from the Gate of Death. However, in regards to becoming a Divine Body, I am truly incapable of enjoying it. Senior, farewell.” Chu Lingxi replied loudly.

Hearing those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice did not sound again.

With that, Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa left.

Grandmaster Liangqiu, on the other hand, stayed.

After seeing Chu Lingxi and the others off. Chu Feng hurriedly returned to the palace where the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was.

The most external palace hall inside the palace was the location where Chu Feng trained. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he had been in the inner hall the entire time.

Normally, unless the Ox-nosed Old Daoist called for him, Chu Feng would not take the initiative to set foot into the inner hall.

However, this time around, Chu Feng directly pushed through the door and entered the inner hall.

After pushing open the inner hall’s doors, he discovered the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. However, the instant he saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he was immediately stunned.

“Senior, you...”

At that moment, Chu Feng had a very pained expression in his eyes.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was currently naked and sitting cross-legged in a tub.

That tub was created with a spirit formation. It was a healing formation.

Chu Feng was able to hear from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice earlier that he was slightly weak.

Because of that, Chu Feng was worried about him, and decided to directly enter the inner hall.

And now, the situation of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was much more severe than he had imagined.

“Why did you come in here?” The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was slightly displeased to see Chu Feng in the inner hall.

“Senior, please don’t say anything for now.” Chu Feng ignored his displeasure and directly arrived before him. He released his spirit power to help the Ox-nosed Old Daoist treat his injuries.

Chu Feng was feeling very complicated. A look of guilt and shame filled his face.

Although the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had an ugly appearance and was very old, he was someone who spoke with great confidence, great strength and a lot of laughter.

However, the current Ox-nosed Old Daoist was extremely weak.

Chu Feng knew that the reason why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was so weak was due to him helping him and Chu Lingxi in the tempering of their bodies.

Chu Feng had realized from the very start that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would wear out his body by helping them increase the speed of their tempering process.

However, it was only after seeing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist that Chu Feng discovered that the exhaustion to his body was much more severe than he had imagined.

Chu Lingxi had wrongly blamed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had most definitely not deceived them. Otherwise, there would be no reason for him to become like that by helping them.

Whilst treating the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng was unable to take his gaze off his body.

Although the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was extremely weak, the wounds that covered his body were even more shocking to the eyes.

Those were old wounds. His wounds covered his entire body. It seemed like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s body was once shattered to pieces, and then gradually put back together.

Those wounds were no ordinary wounds. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to not heal, for them to remain so clear and vivid.

Chu Feng suspected that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist must’ve been seriously injured in the past.

His injuries must have been extremely destructive. Even though the wounds were old, Chu Feng was able to imagine what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had suffered back then.

In fact, Chu Feng even felt that it was a miracle that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was still alive.

Perhaps... that was what it truly meant to survive by the skin of one’s teeth.
