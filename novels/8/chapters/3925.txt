Chapter 3925 - Acquaintance

“Spirit Spring Water? Young friend Asura, how much do you need?” asked the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Roughly a million kilos,” said Chu Feng.

“A million kilos?”

Even the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster was surprised to hear that number.

She was also a world spiritist. Although her world spirit techniques were inferior to Chu Feng’s, she still knew about Spirit Spring Water.

Although Spirit Spring Water was not extremely precious, it was also not something that could be found in great quantity. Furthermore, people would ordinarily only need one or two kilos.

In fact, many people only needed several catties.

Yet, Chu Feng actually needed a million kilos of Spirit Spring Water. This shocked the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Young friend Asura, why do you need so much Spirit Spring Water?”

“You’re most likely not only using it to train, no?”

“After all, even though Spirit Spring Water is capable of strengthening one’s spirit power, the effect is only temporary. It would not be practical to use it to train with.”

“Thus, I am truly quite curious as to why young friend Asura needs so much Spirit Spring Water,” the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster looked at Chu Feng with a curious gaze.

“Senior, just like how you have your secrets, I also have my own secrets. Thus, please forgive me for being rude, but this junior is unable to inform senior of what the Spirit Spring Water will be used for,” said Chu Feng.

“Very well. I will not ask anymore,” the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster smiled. Soon afterward, she said, “You can leave the million kilos worth of Spirit Spring Water to me. That said, I will need some time to gather that much Spirit Spring Water. Furthermore, I don’t really have the time these days. How about this, you can come and retrieve the Spirit Spring Water from me in a year’s time.”

“A year?”

Hearing that number, Chu Feng felt that the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster would not be able to help him.

Chu Feng needed such a vast amount of Spirit Spring Water because he needed to comprehend the gem he had obtained from the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb, and increase his world spirit techniques to the Dragon Mark Saint-cloak level.

A year would be too long. Chu Feng was simply unable to wait that long.

If it were a year, even if Chu Feng didn’t use Spirit Spring Water, he would likely be able to successfully comprehend the gem on his own.

The reason why Chu Feng needed such a great amount of Sprint Spring Water was because he wanted to increase his world spirit power quickly. If he had to wait an entire year, there would no longer be any use for the Spirit Spring Water.

“Senior, thank you for your kind intentions. However, senior doesn’t have to trouble herself with this matter. I will think of a way myself,” said Chu Feng.

“Wait. Young friend Asura, if you need it urgently, I know of a place that might be able to help you,” said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Senior, what place might that be?” asked Chu Feng.

“The Reincarnation Upper Realm’s Mount Ivory Valley. That is a place that produces Spirit Spring Water.”

“Spirit Spring Water flows from that place year-round. That said, although the Spirit Spring Water flows steadily, the amount is very limited. Furthermore, the Spirit Spring Water that flows out is all collected by the people there.”

“That said, people have guessed that even though a very limited amount of Spirit Spring Water flows out from Mount Ivory Valley, the water source should have a lot more Spirit Spring Water.”

“Unfortunately, the mountain rocks of Mount Ivory Valley are all protected by spirit formations. No one is able to cut through the mountain. Because of that, no one is able to reach the spring water source.”

“If you’re able to find the source, then perhaps you will be able to obtain a million kilos worth of Spirit Spring Water,” said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Mount Ivory Valley? Senior, where is that Mount Ivory Valley located?” asked Chu Feng.

“Mount Ivory Valley is a little remote. However, it will not take too long to reach it using the Ancient Era’s teleportation formations.”

“That said, Mount Ivory Valley is guarded by the Cloudspirit Clan. The Cloudspirit Clan is rather eccentric. They are a clan that fears nothing and no one.”

“Young friend Asura, are you really in such a rush? If you’re not in a huge rush, you can wait some days, and I‘ll go there with you.”

“Although the Cloudspirit Clan, with their personality, might not necessarily give me face, I am able to use my martial power to suppress them in crucial times,” said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Roughly what is the cultivation of the strongest person of the Cloudspirit Clan?” asked Chu Feng.

“The strongest individual in the Cloudspirit Clan was a rank two Utmost Exalted. As for their current cultivation, I am not certain,” said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Rank two Utmost Exalted? That powerful?” Chu Feng felt surprised upon hearing those words.

The Red-dress Holy Land was the fully-deserving overlord of the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

Yet, even they, apart from their Lady Headmaster, who possessed the cultivation of rank three Utmost Exalted, only had two rank two Utmost Exalted amongst their Supreme Elders.

Yet, the strongest expert from the Cloudspirit Clan was actually a rank two Utmost Exalted.

From this, one could see that the so-called Cloudspirit Clan possessed strength that could not be looked down on. Furthermore, from what the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster had said, it seemed that they had a very eccentric temperament. They were a clan of people that refused to give anyone face.

From this, Chu Feng could tell that this was a rather thorny clan to deal with.

“It would appear that young friend Asura is truly in a rush. Unfortunately, I am truly unable to leave this place right now.”

“How about this, I’ll dispatch my elders to accompany you,” said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Senior, there’s no need. I actually know of a place that also possesses Spirit Spring Water. It’s just that the journey there would be rather far. That place is not located in this Starfield, but it has a very abundant amount of Spirit Spring Water. It would do for me to proceed for that place instead,” said Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was actually lying.

Chu Feng knew that even though those two Supreme Elders of the Red-dress Holy Land were both rank two Utmost Exalted, they had been seriously injured by Linghu Zhishi at the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond, and had still not recovered.

Chu Feng could not bear to trouble them at a time when they were still seriously injured.

Because of that, he decided to lie.

He lied because he did not wish to trouble them. However, he still decided to check out that Mount Ivory Valley.

If Chu Feng could obtain the Spirit Spring Water, it would be ideal. If it was too difficult, he would just give up on it.

Afterwards, Chu Feng and the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster chatted some more. Then, Chu Feng told her of his intention to leave. The Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster was able to tell that he was impatient to leave to obtain Spirit Spring Water. Thus, she did not attempt to make him stay.

Chu Feng then left to find Yin Zhuanghong so that he could bid her farewell.

After Chu Feng left, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster opened a secret stone entrance.

Then, holding the jug Chu Feng felt to be nefarious, she entered the stone entrance.

The Yin aura inside the stone entrance was even more intense. Extremely thick ice and frost covered that place. That place was strangely dark. There were blood-red candles placed all around. Those candles were actually emitting blood-colored light.

Furthermore, blood-red vein lines would appear on the ground of the pitch-black space from time to time. This made that place appear particularly strange.

That was a spirit formation. The entire place was a giant spirit formation.

If Chu Feng saw that grand formation, he would definitely be alarmed.

Chu Feng would know that that grand formation was a soul gathering formation, a taboo spirit formation used to fuse souls with.

Suddenly, an extremely aged voice sounded, “Xiu’er, who were you talking with earlier?”

That voice was extremely weak. It seemed like it was from someone on the verge of death.

“Milady, it was a person of the younger generation. That person possesses very strong world spirit techniques. He is the one who helped me fuse this soul-fixing item.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster actually revealed an extremely humble and respectful attitude after hearing that voice.

“Younger generation? What’s his name?” asked that voice.

“Milady, he is called Asura,” said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Asura?” Hearing that name, the voice grew a bit bleak. It seemed to be disappointed.

“Milady, is something the matter?” asked the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“It’s nothing. It’s merely that the tone in which that person of the younger generation spoke earlier reminded me of someone I know,” said that person.
