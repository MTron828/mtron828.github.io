Chapter 5951: The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s Remnants

“Amazing. You tamed the Frenzy Tsunami Saber so easily. Jie Tianran, that old thing, must be blind to refuse to acknowledge such an outstanding grandson. Does he not regret it?” Little Fishy’s grandfather murmured contemplatively. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Elder, would it be fine for me to use this God Armament in public?”

Chu Feng had refrained from using the spear he had stolen from Huangyu Shengyu and the others because he feared that they would trace their death to him. As long as he didn’t reveal the spear, everyone on the Nine Heavens’ Zenith would be as suspicious as him.

At least, the Huangfu Heavenly Clan wouldn’t have a proper reason to deal with him yet.

Due to that, it wasn't convenient for him to use the spear.

A cultivator of his level was bound to be disadvantaged without a God Armament, especially when he was fighting against a powerful opponent of the same cultivation level. This Frenzy Tsunami Saber would compensate for that.

However, this was the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s God Armament, after all. If others believed that he was on close terms with the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, that could bring trouble to them, given the enemies he had right now.

“Feel free to use it. It doesn’t descend from our heritage, and I concealed my identity when I bought this God Armament,” Little Fishy’s grandfather explained.

“Thank you, elder. This is exactly what I need now,” Chu Feng replied.

“This isn’t anything much yet. My meeting gift is the real deal,” Little Fishy’s grandfather said as he took out a Csomos Sack.

This Cosmos Sack was transparent, so Chu Feng could see the items stored within. It was filled with Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads.

He had once obtained one from the Ancient Realm’s Sacred Heavenly Temple, and it was a huge impetus for his breakthrough to Half-God level. Yet, there were over a million of them in this Cosmos Sack.

That being said, these Sacred Temple Beads weren’t as useful to him now due to the breakthroughs he had made since. On top of that, he needed far more cultivation resources than his peers to make a breakthrough, such that even a million Half-God level Sacred Temple Bedas might not be enough, there was no denying that this gift was invaluable.

“Elder, isn’t this too much?” Chu Feng felt bad, having just received a high-quality God Armament.

“This can’t be more important than my granddaughter. You saved my granddaughter. It would be unseemly of our Immortal Sea Fish Clan to not offer you something of value. Grandson-in-law, there’s no need to stand on ceremony. You deserve it,” Little Fishy’s grandfather said.

“Grandfather is right. Big brother, take it.” Little Fishy took the Cosmos Sack and stuffed it into Chu Feng’s hands too.

Little Fishy’s grandfather let out a sigh. Is my granddaughter helping an outsider fleece our clan right now? If I wasn’t earnest about thanking Chu Feng, I might have just popped a vein by now.

“Grandson-in-law...”

“Elder, you should call me Chu Feng instead,” Chu Feng said.

“All right. Chu Feng, I have a question I’d like to ask. How did you save my granddaughter?”

While they were searching Bluesnow Upper Realm, they found where Little Fishy was imprisoned. The treasures used for channeling the formations had been taken away, but there were remains of what had been consumed.

From that, he could tell that his granddaughter had been guarded by formidable formations, such that it would have been nigh impossible for anyone beneath Heavenly God to overcome them. Thus, he was curious to know how someone of Chu Feng’s caliber was able to pull it off.

“Elder, I obtained a means to circumvent formations through a fortuitous encounter. It was thanks to that that I was able to rescue Little Fishy,” Chu Feng replied.

“What a formidable means. Is it an Ancient Era’s legacy?” Little Fishy’s grandfather asked.

“You can say so.” Chu Feng nodded.

“It looks like my gifts still fall short.”

Little Fishy’s grandfather shook his head and sighed. There was no doubt in his mind that such a formidable means had to be a one-time-use consumable, and its value was likely greater than whatever he had given to Chu Feng.

This one-time-use consumable would have been invaluable to Chu Feng, especially with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion on his tail, but he still chose to use it to Little Fishy.

“Let’s do this instead. Yu’er, you’ll bring Chu Feng to our Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Myriad Immortals Refinement Lakes,” Little Fishy’s grandfather said.

“Grandfather, are we going to sneak big brother there?” Little Fishy discreetly asked.

The Myriad Immortals Refinement Lakes was an important place to the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Of course, Chu Feng had the right to enter the Myriad Immortals Refinement Lakes, given what he had just done for their clan, but other powers might think that they were on close terms.

“We’ll bring him openly,” Little Fishy’s grandfather discreetly replied.

“Grandfather, aren’t you worried about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion going after us?”

“Yu’er, you and your big brother need not hesitate to befriend Chu Feng. How our clan treats Chu Feng is our business. Our Immortal Sea Fish Clan isn’t subordinate to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, so we need not share the same stance as them. We permitted the two of you to befriend Chu Feng to prove to the world that we don’t fear any powers.

“That being said, we can’t openly protect Chu Feng, as that would have been no different from declaring war on the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. There’s a difference in these two matters,” Little Fishy’s grandfather said.

“I understand now. Thank you, grandfather.”

That was the kind of attitude she wanted. She hoped that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan could accept Chu Feng even when he was going through difficult times.

“I have other matters to attend to, so I shan’t interrupt you two lovebirds,” Little Fishy’s grandfather said via voice transmission.

He bade Chu Feng farewell before taking his leave.

“Little Fishy, is the Myriad Immortals Refinement Lakes a cultivation spot?” Chu Feng asked.

“It is. You should reap better results assimilating the Sacred Temple Beads there. Big brother, I’ll bring you there when you recover from your injuries,” Little Fishy said.

“There’s no need for that. I’ll bring you trouble if I cultivate in your turf.”

“It’s not a problem. My grandfather has already given his approval, so you need not feel burdened by it. You absolutely have to come with me, or else I won’t let you leave,” Little Fishy said earnestly.

She grabbed Chu Feng’s arm, looking as if she wouldn’t let go if he refused to go with her.

“Fine, let’s head there now then,” Chu Feng relented.

“Good.” Little Fishy nodded.

“Little Fishy, you know more about the world of cultivation compared to me. Is there anything special about these four places?”

Chu Feng drew out four maps with a wave of his sleeves, reflecting the Totem Galaxy, the Bloodline Galaxy, the Divine Body Galaxy, and the Seven Realms Galaxy. These were where the remaining four key fragments were located.

Chu Feng had intended to ask the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s guild leader about it when paying a visit to her, but he was so anxious to save Little Fishy upon learning that she had been kidnapped that he forgot about it.

He could tell that Little Fishy’s grandfather was no ordinary cultivator either, so he figured that she could ask her grandfather about it even if she wasn’t sure.

“I know those four places. They are where the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnants are,” Little Fishy said.
