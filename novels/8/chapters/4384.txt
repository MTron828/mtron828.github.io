Chapter 4384: Divine Stone of the Seven Realms

While tolerating the pain, Chu Feng’s body sunk deeper and deeper in.

Just as his feet were about to reach the bottom, the searing pain on his body began to alleviate. At the same time, his seared body was beginning to recover too.

It was the formation that was working to heal his injuries.

That being said, Chu Feng didn’t pay much heed to it. He quickly scanned his surroundings to look for the treasure that was useful for world spirits.

But for some reason, despite looking around the area, he was unable to find the treasure at all.

“Why is it not around? It should have been in the vicinity...”

Chu Feng was deeply perplexed. Even under the effects of the Heaven’s Eyes, he was unable to find the treasure.

Yet, he was certain that it was around the area based on the aura he was perceiving.

This made him a little anxious.

He had cleared the trial, but the treasure was nowhere to be found. Didn’t this mean that he had suffered all that pain for nothing?

Hu!

It was at this moment that the heat waves from the lava began manifesting itself as a layer of mist. The mist quickly interweaved with one another before eventually forming a stone.

It was a very irregular stone. It was around the size of a watermelon, and there were seven different colors gleaming on its surface. It emanated a dense aura of energy.

Such cultivation resource was extremely rare to see in the world.

Even though it couldn’t match the Asura God Stone, Chu Feng believed that it would be able to increase Yu Sha’s cultivation significantly.

So, he quickly took the stone and entered his World Spirit Space.

“How is it, lass? My suffering wasn’t in vain, right? If I’m not mistaken, this stone should be able to raise your cultivation up to another level,” Chu Feng said as he walked up to Yu Sha.

“This is the Divine Stone of the Seven Realms. It harnesses a lot of energy,” Yu Sha remarked.

“Oh? You recognize the origin of the stone?” Chu Feng was surprised.

“Before entering this world, I have already resolved myself to become a world spirit. I have already asked around my elders about the various matters surrounding the world of cultivators beforehand, as well as what kind of stuff would be useful to me,” Yu Sha said.

“I see. Take it,” Chu Feng said as he passed it over to Yu Sha.

He was feeling rather glad inside. Since Yu Sha knew about this stone, she should know how to use it to its fullest effectiveness too.

Yu Sha didn’t stand on ceremony and took the stone over without much hesitation.

After all, she had her own motives for coming to this world and becoming Chu Feng’s world spirit.

She was here to save her Milady, Xue Ji, but she still lacked the strength to do so at the moment.

“Lass, I’ll be leaving now. You should also know that I’ve urgent things to attend to. You should hurry up and cultivate.”

After saying his piece, Chu Feng prepared to take his leave from his World Spirit Space.

But at this moment, Yu Sha suddenly called out from behind, “Chu Feng.”

“What’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked.

“Thank you.”

Yu Sha’s head was lowered when she said those words. She wasn’t looking at Chu Feng directly at all.

She might have quite an obstinate and domineering personality, but she wasn’t used to expressing her emotions.

“How courteous. Well, I’m also helping myself over here, so you need not feel burdened by this. You did save my life before, and only with you becoming stronger will I have someone to fall back on, isn’t that right?” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

After that, he returned his consciousness into his body and proceeded ahead.

Even though Liu Shangwu had gone on ahead of him and breached the formations and obstacles ahead, the Death Dominion worked in a way where the formations would automatically restore themselves once a challenger had passed.

As such, Chu Feng wasn’t able to simply lay back and enjoy the fruits of Liu Shangwu’s hard work.

That being said, the formations within the Death Dominion posed no challenge to Chu Feng at all.

It might be named the Death Dominion, but Chu Feng didn’t sense any danger at all.

...

Meanwhile, the world spiritist tournament finally reached its final stages.

The last round was situated in the midst of an ancient castle. This ancient castle was situated above the clouds, making it appear like a heavenly palace.

It wasn’t an original construct of this city but the work of the Sagacious Grandmaster.

Entry into this ancient castle was limited.

Other than the competitors who had managed to make it to the final rounds of the tournament, only those who were of certain standing were allowed to enter its premises.

As such, there weren’t many people there, only around several hundred.

Every single one of these several hundred people was a noteworthy figure in the Nine Souls Galaxy, but nevertheless, there were still some who stood out from the rest.

The Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea was one such example. They tended to draw gazes no matter where they went due to their ravishing appearances and their formidable strength as Martial Exalted level cultivators.

Other than them, there was also one elder that stood out conspicuously amongst the crowd.

This elder had a lanky appearance, but there was a benevolent look on his face. His hair was white like snow, and he emanated an aura that felt as if he was untouched by the secular world. It was almost as if he was an immortal who had distanced himself from worldly materialism.

And this elder was no other than the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster.

Of course, the one person who stood out the most was neither the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster nor the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea. Instead, it was an old man dressed in ordinary clothes whose hair looked particularly unkempt. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

His raggedness wasn’t just in his appearance. There was a sour stench coming from his body, a smell that could have only come from not bathing for many years.

Had it been any other occasion, the several hundred people within the castle would have surely distanced himself from that old man.

But that was not the case here. Not only did no one dare to disrespect that ragged old man, but they were even treating him with utmost respect.

That was because he was the owner of this ancient castle, as well as one of the strongest world spiritists of the Nine Souls Galaxy, the Sagacious Grandmaster.

At this very moment, however, everyone’s gaze was gathered in the center of the ancient castle, where a vast dueling ring was.

Rather than calling it a dueling ring, it felt more like a grassland plain instead due to its sheer size.

Without a doubt, the ancient castle was much larger on the inside than how it looked on the outside, and this dueling ring took up the bulk of the space.

There were two people on the dueling ring at the moment. One of them was already lying on the ground and the other one was standing on the spot.

In contrast to the person lying on the ground, the person who was standing didn’t have any injuries, and even his clothes were still clean. He was no other than the First Personal Disciple of the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster, Zhao Xuanhe.

“Zhao Xuanhe, I didn’t expect you to have grasped the rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation. I’m no match for you.”

The person lying on the ground forced himself to sit up as he spoke with a feeble voice.

“The winner is out. Zhao Xuanhe really hasn’t let us down.”

“The battle of the outcome was already predetermined from the start.”

“Congratulation, Sectmaster Xu.”

Many of those present in the castle turned their heads toward the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster and offered their congratulations.

They knew that the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster doted on Zhao Xuanhe quite a bit. Even though Zhao Xuanhe was only one of his disciples, it appeared that he had the intention to groom Zhao Xuanhe as his successor.

“But why isn’t the treasure box opening yet?”

Very soon, the gazes of the crowd turned to the copper box floating at the top of the dueling ring.

It looked ordinary at first glance, but it was peculiarly eye-catching. The treasure that was prepared by the Sagacious Grandmaster was inside the copper box.

Based on what they knew, as soon as the victor of the tournament was decided, the treasure box would open on its own accord. Yet, the fact that it wasn’t opening left many feeling deeply confused.

“The fact that treasure box has yet to open means that someone is challenging the Death Dominion. Let’s wait for a while longer,” the Sagacious Grandmaster spoke up and addressed everyone’s doubts.

“Someone is challenging the Death Dominion? Who is it?”

The crowd was surprised to hear those words.

Even Zhao Xuanhe also turned his gaze toward the edge of the dueling ring, where a formation gate that served as the exit of the Death Dominion was.

If a person successfully cleared the Death Dominion, he would appear from the formation gate.

Coincidentally, just as Zhao Xuanhe’s gaze fell upon the formation gate, the formation gate suddenly shuddered a little, and a silhouette walked out from within.
