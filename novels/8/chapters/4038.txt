Chapter 4038 - Return Of The Overlord

It was due to a single item that the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were so nervous -- the letter that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief held in his hand.

That letter had been delivered by the old man wearing the purple-gold gown who’d just left.

It was a special invitation letter.

The reason that letter was special was because only the overlord of a starfield was qualified to receive the invitation.

Those invitation letters indicated that it was not only the Chu Heavenly Clan that received such a letter, but all the strongest powers of the other starfields would have received an invitation letter as well.

However, the Ancestral Martial Starfield was one of the Holy Light Galaxy’s Ten Abandoned Starfields, the ten weakest starfields amongst the Holy Light Galaxy’s ninety-six starfields.

As the Ten Abandoned Starfields were too weak, they were not even qualified to participate in the Holy Light Galaxy’s grand occasions. That was also the reason they were known as the ‘abandoned’ starfields.

As such, the fact that the Ancestral Martial Starfield had received the invitation letter indicated that the other overlords of the ten ’Abandoned’ Starfields had also received invitation letters.

If the letter was for a grand occasion, it would only be a grand occasion for the Ten Abandoned Starfields.

Logically, since the Ten Abandoned Starfields were all roughly of equal power, it was not much for them to be gathered together.

Furthermore, there had been many gatherings between them before.

Otherwise, the All-heaven Sect and the other four powers wouldn’t have become allies.

Nevertheless, the Chu Heavenly Clan still felt enormous pressure.

The reason for that was wholly because they were simply too weak.

Whilst they were the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they were not the strongest in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

The reason they were able to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord was wholly because it was the desire of the Three Cities.

Being supported by the Three Cities meant that even if there were people that were dissatisfied with them being the overlord, they could only keep their dissatisfaction in their hearts; no one dared to voice their thoughts.

However, things would be different if they were to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Those powerful existences would not worry about that at all.

If they looked down on them, they would definitely express it. If the Chu Heavenly Clan decided to participate, they would definitely be looked down on.

That was the reason why the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were frowning so heavily.

“Lord Clan Chief, are we not able to refuse?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked all of a sudden.

“I’m afraid that wouldn’t do. Lord Clan Chief agreed to participate earlier,” said Chu Hanpeng.

“Are we not allowed to back out just because we agreed to it?” asked Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Back out? That’s an invitation letter from the Purple Star Hall.”

“If we refuse to participate, it would be equivalent to not giving the Purple Star Hall face.”

“We cannot even afford to offend the other starfields. How can we possibly afford to offend the Purple Star Hall?”

Chu Hanpeng had a helpless look on his face as he said those words.

Hearing Chu Hanpeng’s words, Chu Xuanzhengfa lowered his head.

What sort of existence was the Purple Star Hall?

They were also the overlord of a starfield.

The old man in the purple-gold gown from before was from the Purple Star Hall.

That said, the Purple Star Hall was not from the Ten Abandoned Starfields.

Rather, they were the overlord of a Lower Starfield.

Although they were only the overlord of a Lower Starfield, they were absolutely not people that the Abandoned Starfields could compare to.

As such, the Purple Star Hall possessed strength surpassing all the Abandoned Starfields.

Even without Chu Hanpeng telling him that, Chu Xuanzhengfa knew that they could not afford to offend the Purple Star Hall.

The only reason he didn’t want to participate in the grand occasion was because he didn’t want their Lord Clan Chief to be humiliated.

As such, whilst the grand occasion might be a gathering for the other starfields, it might be nothing more than a Feast at Swan Goose Gate for the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Lord Clan Chief, you’re a very busy individual, it is better that I keep the appointment on your behalf.”

Suddenly, Chu Xuanzhengfa raised his head and looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

He didn’t wish for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to be humiliated and, since they could not refuse to participate. To be humiliated in their Lord Clan Chief’s stead, became the only suggestion he could think of.

However, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled and waved his hand at Chu Xuanzhengfa’s proposal. “Zhengfa, I appreciate your intention. However, this is something that this old man must personally attend to.”

“But, Lord Clan Chief, you...” Chu Xuanzhengfa still wanted to dissuade him.

“Zhengfa, you must also know that this grand occasion is bad for our Chu Heavenly Clan, no?”

“However, have you thought of why it is only bad to our Chu Heavenly Clan?” asked the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“It’s because our Chu Heavenly Clan is the weakest.”

“The world of martial cultivators is a world where the weak are prey to the strong. That has been the principle since ancient times,” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“That’s right. Insufficient strength, that is the main reason.”

“With the strength that our Chu Heavenly Clan possesses, we are indeed unqualified to become a starfield’s overlord. All of us present know that very well.”

“However, even if our Chu Heavenly Clan does not possess sufficient strength, we must still have integrity.”

“Since this old man has accepted the task of managing the Ancestral Martial Starfield before the masters of the Three Cities, I must shoulder the responsibilities that come with it.”

“This old man cannot only enjoy the respect and reverence of my position. I must also shoulder all the responsibilities that come with being the overlord of a starfield.”

“Thus, how can I hide?”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief swept his gaze across the people present as he said those words.

All the elders lowered their heads silently.

None of them were able to find grounds to refuse their Lord Clan Chief.

“Lord Clan Chief, in that case, allow me to accompany you,” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“I’ll consider it.”

After saying that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief put the invitation letter away.

“Lord Clan Chief...”

“Lord Supreme Elders...”

“Elders, this is bad!”

Right at that moment, an elder rushed in and immediately knelt on the ground.

His face was completely pale and he was covered in sweat. Even his clasped hands trembled slightly.

It was as if he had received an enormous scare.

“What scandalous behavior! What are you making a fuss about?!”

“Fortunately, Lord Envoy left. Otherwise, you’d have thoroughly disgraced our Chu Heavenly Clan!”

The people present were already very agitated to begin with. As such, the appearance of the messenger immediately provoked their ire. A few people immediately started to angrily denounce the messenger.

Of course, it was not only because they were upset. There was another reason.

That reason would be the fact that that elder was simply in too much of a panic.

Their Chu Heavenly Clan was already no longer the same as before.

With the protection of the Three Cities, practically no one would dare to cause trouble for them.

Who would possibly dare to oppose them?

That was the reason why someone had denounced the elder for making a fuss about nothing.

That said, even though he was denounced by the elders, the panicked appearance of the elder did not change in the slightest.

“It-it-it’s... it’s the Star-star-starfield Master Realm, th-they’ve returned.”

The elder was so scared that he even stuttered.

“Starfield Master Realm?!”

Hearing those words, even Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s expressions changed.

“You mean to say that the Wuming Clan has returned?” asked the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Right. F-f-furthermore, t-they’re r-ri-right o-outside t-the entrance of our C-Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“They’ve come fier-fiercely. I... I think that t-they’re n-no-not here with k-kind intentions.”

“Lord Clan Chief, Lord E-elders, p-please go l-look.”

That elder was about to cry as he spoke.

He was truly terrified.

In fact, he was no longer the only person terrified at that moment.

The elders that had denounced him earlier about making a fuss about nothing were also shivering in fear. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In fact, even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Xuanzhengfa had ugly looks on their faces.
