Chapter 3916 - Grandmaster Tang Chen

What Chu Feng didn’t know was that right after he left, a figure appeared in the place.

It was an old man. He wore a black gown and had a head of long hair. Although he looked very old, he also appeared very spirited. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Most importantly, the aura and presence he emitted were extremely rare in the world.

That man fully gave off the air of an immortal.

That person was Grandmaster Yuan Shu’s master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s close friend, Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Yuan Shu walked up to his master and asked, “Master, why didn’t you help directly?”

“No matter what, brother Chu Feng is senior Ox-nose’s disciple. If some sort of unexpected accident is to happen to him in your territory, senior Ox-nose will likely be unhappy, no?”

“Humph, what does anything that could happen to his disciple have anything to do with me?”

“Besides, this old man has already saved him once.” Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke. His voice was identical to that of the mysterious old man’s voice Chu Feng had heard in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

Sure enough, the person who had rescued Chu Feng all on his own and then defeated the Galewind Hunting Clan’s experts was Yuan Shu’s master, Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“That’s not too good, no? How about I go and check things out?” said Yuan Shu.

“You’re not allowed to go.” Grandmaster Tang Chen immediately lashed out at Yuan Shu.

“Are we really going to disregard this?” asked Yuan Shu.

“Yuan Shu, what have I, your master, taught you? Do you think you’re a savior? Must you save everyone’s life?” asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Of course not. If I felt that way, I wouldn’t have done nothing as those black-clothed people massacred the innocent. More than that, I wouldn’t have ignored the Red-dress Holy Land.”

“However, brother Chu Feng is different from those people. After all, he is senior Ox-nose’s disciple. Furthermore, I also like him a lot,” said Yuan Shu.

“That’s still a no. You are absolutely not allowed to do anything. Otherwise, this old man will break all ties with you,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Okay okay okay. I will definitely not do anything. Master, please cool your temper, please do not break all ties with me. Your disciple still needs master’s guidance.”

Although that was what Yuan Shu was saying, he had a mischievous smile on his face.

Although Yuan Shu was seen to be the all powerful Grandmaster Yuan Shu in the eyes of others, his behavior was like that of a child when he was before his master.

From this, it could be seen that the relationship of that master and disciple was extremely good.

“This could also be considered to be a test for him.”

“The treasures inside the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond have long since been retrieved by your master.”

“That Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond is nothing more than an empty mystic grounds now. There’s nothing to gain from there at all.”

“Because of that, the protective barrier of the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond is much weaker than before.”

“If that brat by the name of Chu Feng is unable to handle even such a weakened Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond, how exactly is he supposed to challenge my bet with Ox-nose?”

“If he’s unable to even handle that Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond, it would mean that he’s a failure, and might as well die. It’s better for Ox-nose to find a new disciple,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Master, that Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond is only easy for you. For brother Chu Feng, it would not be easy at all. Even for me, I might not necessarily be able to handle it,” said Yuan Shu.

“Say what? You said you’re unable to handle that mere Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond?”

“This old man had strenuously nurtured you for all these years, yet you’re only this capable?”

“If you’re unable to even handle that Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond, you might as well scram right away. Do not attempt to go and breach the spirit formation established by Ox-nose, for you will only humiliate this old man.”

At that moment, Grandmaster Tang Chen was actually somewhat angry.

“Master, I was wrong. I was truly wrong.”

Seeing that, Yuan Shu no longer dared to smile mischievously anymore. He immediately began to appease his master.

......

Meanwhile. Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong were proceeding toward the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond.

“Chu Feng, you really managed to meet Grandmaster Yuan Shu? He really told you there’s another entrance to the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond?” Yin Zhuanghong asked en route.

She felt very shocked. After all, their Red-dress Holy Land had been controlling the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond the entire time.

They should know the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond better than anyone.

Yet, Chu Feng had actually told her that there was another entrance to the Ancient Era’s Blood Refinement Pond. Naturally, she would be shocked. After all, she had never heard of anyone mention there being another entrance before.

“Grandmaster Yuan Shu definitely wouldn’t lie to me.”

Compared to the slightly skeptical Yin Zhuanghong, Chu Feng was extremely certain that there was another entrance.

Soon, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong arrived at a forest.

There were many natural springs in the forest. The entrance Yuan Shu had told Chu Feng about was located in a natural spring.

As Chu Feng had the map, he managed to accurately find that natural spring.

“This is the one,” Chu Feng pointed to the natural spring.

“Were you deceived? My eyes are unable to detect anything from it,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“We’ll know whether I was deceived once we enter it.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he jumped into the natural spring. Seeing that, Yin Zhuanghong, having no other choice, jumped in after him.

At the beginning, there was no change to the natural spring at all. However, as they dove further, a bypass appeared in the waterflow.

There was a very small tunnel deep in the natural spring. There was also spring water inside that tunnel. Merely, the color of the spring water was actually red.

Once Chu Feng swam into the tunnel, a strong reek of blood assailed his nostrils. That reek of blood came from the red spring water.

Most importantly, Chu Feng was certain that it was indeed water, and not blood.

Although it was not blood, both its appearance and smell were identical to blood.
