Chapter 3627 - Stunning Everyone

Logically, no one would bother to pay attention to Chu Feng, and would continue on their way.

However, it just so happened that Yin Zhuanghong also stopped and began to observe that spirit formation gate. Furthermore, she revealed a very interested look on her face.

Seeing that, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations hurriedly began to inform her about that spirit formation gate.

After all, many people among them and many of their seniors were all fortunate enough to have entered the Divine Armament Cemetery in the past.

Thus, their understanding of the Divine Armament Cemetery was no less than that of Kong Tianhui and the others.

Because of that, they were urging Yin Zhuanghong not to enter that spirit formation gate.

However, Yin Zhuanghong completely ignored them. She acted as if she did not hear their words at all.

However, the All-heaven Starfield’s proud younger generations were not angered. After all, they already knew what sort of personality she had. Thus, they were already feeling very honored to be able to interact with her. How could they possibly dare to blame her for ignoring them?

“You must’ve noticed something, right?”

Suddenly, Yin Zhuanghong spoke. This was the first time she had spoken to someone since her arrival.

Even when the icy and arrogant Nangong Yifan took the initiative to speak to her, she merely nodded, and at most respond to him with an ‘mn.’ Her responses were always as short as they could possibly be.

However, now, she actually spoke. Most shocking of all, it was actually Chu Feng who caused her to speak of her own accord.

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to sense countless fierce beast-like gazes fixed on him. The emotions within those gazes were more than only envy and jealousy. They were simply itching to dismember him into ten thousand pieces.

Uncertain, Chu Feng asked, “Miss Yin, are you speaking to me?”

“That’s right,” Yin Zhuanghong nodded.

“I did manage to detect something. However, I will have to continue to observe it. There is only one chance. If you wish to accompany me, you would have to come to my side,” said Chu Feng.

“Have you gone insane? Who do you think you are? And you want Miss Yin to accompany you?”

“You are most definitely a toad that wants to eat swan meat, and have gone insane by thinking about it too much.”

“Miss Yin, you absolutely must not trust him. That fellow has some issues with his head. Earlier, I saw him studying the highest-level chess strategy. That guy is definitely abnormal.”

At that moment, many people from the All-heaven Starfield began to speak out against Chu Feng.

“Brother Kong, are you going to accompany me?” Chu Feng looked to Kong Tianhui.

“Brother Chu Feng, you don’t know this, but my luck is extremely bad. Adding on this time, I’ve been to this Divine Armament Cemetery three times already. However, I’ve only been able to obtain scrap iron every time. I haven’t even been able to obtain an Immortal Armament.”

“This time around, I will definitely not return empty-handed. I must earnestly make my selection. I don’t dare to take chances anymore. Thus, I will not be accompanying you,” Kong Tianhui gestured with his hand.

“I can help you make your selection,” said Chu Feng.

“Hahaha, am I mishearing things? He wants to help make his selection? Who does he think he is?”

“Not only is he a madman, but he’s even enormously boastful.”

At that moment, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were spouting all sorts of malicious words at Chu Feng. Even the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were sneering at him.

To their understanding, no one would be able to use any techniques or tricks to make their selections inside the Divine Armament Cemetery. They would all have to rely on their luck. Thus, they felt Chu Feng’s words to be ridiculous.

“Brother Chu Feng, you don’t understand. One can only rely on luck in this place. World spirit techniques are useless here too,” Kong Tianhui said quietly to Chu Feng. Compared to the others, he had no intention of ridiculing him. Instead, he was advising him with kind intentions.

Seeing that Kong Tianhui was so distrusting of him, Chu Feng did not bother to explain things to him. Instead, he looked to the three beauties. “Miss Kong Ci, Miss Long Ning, Miss Xian Yun, what about you three?”

“I’m not going with you,” Kong Ci refused decisively.

“Young master Chu Feng, I think I’ll make my selection myself,” Xian Yun refused tactfully.

As for Long Ning, she narrowed her eyes and revealed her teeth to smile foolishly. That smile of hers revealed her answer to Chu Feng.

“Sure enough, he’s a toad that wants to eat swan meat. Seeing that he is unable to invite Miss Yin Zhuanghong, he decided to attempt to invite our three celestial faeries.”

“Never would I have imagined this Chu Feng to be such a shameless fellow. It’s no wonder he would hang out with someone like Kong TIanhui.”

“How could someone like senior Chu Xuanyuan give birth to a son this shameless?”

Seeing that Chu Feng had actually attempted to invite Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun, the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield were unable to tolerate him anymore either, and began to lash out at him.

That said, compared to the others, Nangong Yifan’s gaze was fixed on Yin Zhuanghong the entire time.

“Miss Yin, let’s continue,” Nangong Yifan said to Yin Zhuanghong.

“Woosh~~~”

However, right after his words left his mouth, Yin Zhuanghong’s body shifted. She had leapt into the spirit formation gate.

After she leaped into the spirit formation gate, it closed.

Seeing that, Kong Tianhui asked loudly, “Where’s my brother Chu Feng?”

He discovered that Chu Feng, who was beside him earlier, had disappeared.

“Chu Feng entered that spirit formation gate first. Yin Zhuanghong followed him in afterwards,” Kong Ci revealed the answer to the crowd.

“What? Miss Yin Zhuanghong actually really followed him in?”

“Wouldn’t that mean that the two of them, man and woman, are currently alone together?”

“Ahhhh!!! Heavens! If I knew that Miss Yin would enter, I would’ve followed him too!” Kong Tianhui feld endless regret. Overwhelmed with regret, he grabbed his hair.

“Strange. In the past, I’ve seen people enter that spirit formation gate too. However, the spirit formation gate would remain present even after people entered it. Yet this time, why would it close? It’s simply not giving us a chance to follow them,” Kong Tianhui voiced his confusion.

Suddenly, Kong Ci asked, “Could it be that Chu Feng really discovered some sort of secret?”

“Oh, that’s right, I’ve nearly forgotten that guy is a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.”

Such words soon began to sound from the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

“Saint-cloak World Spiritist?” Hearing the words from the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the expressions of those from the All-heaven Starfield changed.

Earlier, none of them had thought highly of Chu Feng. They felt that he was just a pervert emboldened by his lust, someone with mental issues.

However, after learning that Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, they started to have a whole new level of respect for him.

After all, even in their All-heaven Starfield, there had never been such a young Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

Soon, someone voiced their refute, “That’s impossible. So what if he’s a Saint-cloak World Spiritist? This is the Divine Armament Cemetery, it isn’t a place that a world spiritist can see through.”

“That’s right. Selecting weapons in the Divine Armament Cemetery relies wholly on luck and intuition. The observational abilities of world spiritists are simply useless here.”

The crowd nodded upon hearing that refute. They all felt it to make a lot of sense.

“But, why would Miss Yin Zhuanghong choose to trust that guy?”

Soon, someone raised this question.

“I also can’t understand. Why would Miss Yin Zhuanghong trust him?”

Suddenly, someone pointed to Kong Tianhui. “Wait, that guy, didn’t he say earlier that he encountered Miss Yin Zhuanghong together with that Saint-cloak World Spiritist?”

At that moment, the crowd’s gazes all landed on Kong Tianhui.

Kong Tianhui had made a ruckus when Yin had first appeared, but no one had paid any attention to him back then. They all felt that he was spouting nonsense so that he could get her attention.

However, thinking back on it now, they discovered that something seemed amiss.

The reason for that was because they were unable to think of any connection between Yin Zhuanghong and Chu Feng. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Unless... what Kong Tianhui had said was true.
