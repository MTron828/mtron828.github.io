Chapter 3680 - Foolishness And Loyalty

The three City Masters had followed Chu Feng to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Due to their strength, they were able to clearly see the circumstances of the Chu Heavenly Clan, even though they were very far away.

“Never would I have imagined that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s cultivation had increased this much.”

“It is simply a miracle for someone of his talent to be able to obtain such a level of cultivation.”

“Likely, he must’ve came across a fortunate encounter,” said the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master.

“And what if that’s the case? He is simply no match for the Blood-devouring Hall,” said the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master. Then, she turned her gaze to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was right before the three of them. He had no idea that they were behind him. He was still rushing towards the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Chu Feng’s gaze has changed somewhat. He is, after all, a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Over such a distance, he should’ve discovered the situation of the Chu Heavenly Clan,” said the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

“It’s possible that he has discovered it. However, what will he choose to do?” the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master asked.

“What else could he choose? If I was him, I’d turn around to flee immediately,” said the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

“You’re a City Master; is that what a City master should do?” The Divine Body Royal City’s City Master took a glance of contempt at the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

The Monstrous Holy City’s City Master was not angered. Instead, she smiled charmingly, “For a nobleman to take revenge, ten years is not too long. To insist on throwing away one’s life is foolishness.”

“Whilst it can be said to be foolishness, it can also be said to be loyalty,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Oh? In that case, I shall see if this brat is more loyal or more intelligent,” said the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

“We’ll wait and see then,” said the Ancestral Dragon Martial City’s City Master.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng accelerated.

A change had occurred to his body.

Not only was his Lightning Mark activated, but his Lightning Armor had also covered his body. In fact, even the Ancient Era’s War Axe and Ancient Era’s War Sword had appeared.

Chu Feng had activated all of the most powerful abilities he possessed in order to increase his speed. He was rushing towards the Chu Heavenly Clan at his fastest speed.

“This guy, is he trying to die?”

Seeing his behavior, the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master revealed an astonished look.

The Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master, on the other hand, had a faint smile in his eyes.

Compared to the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master seemed to have foreseen Chu Feng making such a decision.

“You seem to have already known that he was going to choose to protect his clansmen?” The Monstrous Holy City’s City Master noticed the change in the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master’s expression.

“It would appear that you don’t understand Chu Xuanyuan,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“What does this have to do with Chu Xuanyuan?” asked the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

“If you understand Chu Xuanyuan, then you know that Chu Feng will absolutely not disregard the life and death of his clansmen. Otherwise... he would not be Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Oh?” The Monstrous Holy City’s City Master’s eyes started to flicker. From her gaze of uncertainty, one could tell that she was still confused.

The Divine Body Royal City’s City Master, on the other hand, had an excited look. He looked at Chu Feng, who was flying rapidly, and burst into sudden laughter. “That brat has guts. I like him.”

............

“Boom~~~”

“Boom~~~”

“Boom~~~”

Meanwhile, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was still locked in battle against the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall.

Terrifying martial power was still wreaking havoc throughout the surroundings. For many of the people present, they could only experience the might of the battle between the nine peak Exalted experts, and not actually see their battle.

That said, the outcome of the battle was already decided.

The reason for that was because the black gaseous flames that covered the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief were starting to ebb. His expression was also changing from a fierce one to one of suffering and pain. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

His battle power was weakening alongside the fading effect of the forbidden medicine. In its place was pain that engulfed his entire body.

“Heeeahhh~~~”

Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, who had entered a disadvantaged state in the battle, suddenly gathered his power to unleash a counter-attack.

At the same time, he shouted to his clansmen, “Run!”

Seeing that he could not last for much longer, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had decided to stop all the enemies with his final bit of strength so that his clansmen would have the opportunity to flee.

“Run? None of you will be able to escape today.”

One of the eight from the Blood-devouring Hall let out a sneer.

Then, his body shifted, and he disappeared.

In the next moment, like a phantom, he appeared before the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. With his hand held like a blade, he thrust into the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s dantian.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief detected the sudden attack, and immediately turned around to avoid it.

However, by the time he avoided the incoming hand thrust, another expert from the Blood-devouring Hall was waiting for him, and shot a punch directly toward his face.

“Bang~~~”

The fist struck. The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was sent flying.

Like a meteor, he fell into the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.

Soil scattered all over as thick dust rose into the sky...

Everything had happened too quickly. By the time the Chu Heavenly Clansmen reacted to what had happened, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had already fallen.

At that moment, cracking sounds could be heard from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Every bone in his body had been fractured.

Most importantly, his face was badly mutilated. It had been beaten beyond recognition.

“Lord Clan Chief!”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s experts all rushed to their Lord Clan Chief’s side. They were trying their best to treat their Lord Clan Chief’s injuries.

Unfortunately, no matter what they did, they were unable to heal their Lord Clan Chief’s injuries. Not only that, but his condition was worsening by the second.

With the situation being like that, weeping sounds could be heard from the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

They were not only grieving for their Lord Clan Chief, but they were also in despair because of the current situation.

Seeing the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that seemed to have lost their determination to resist, the experts from the Blood-devouring Hall all began to smile, taking joy in the misfortune of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

This was precisely what they wanted to see. The more miserable the Chu Heavenly Clan appeared, the more delighted they were.

“What are you all still standing there for?! Do we need to take care of this trash ourselves?!” An expert from the Blood-devouring Hall shouted to the people behind them.

“Milord, leave that trash to us.”

Immediately, many people flew out from the crowd behind the Blood-devouring Hall and unleashed their killing intent. They rushed towards the Chu Heavenly Clansmen with the intention to kill.

Not all of the crusading army behind the Blood-devouring Hall moved. Instead, it was only a small portion that rushed over.

That vanguard group was composed of over five hundred individuals. The weakest among them were peak Martial Immortals, whereas the strongest possessed the cultivation of rank three Exalted.

To the Chu Heavenly Clan that no longer had their Lord Clan Chief to protect them, this mob of five hundred plus was an extremely powerful enemy that they couldn’t necessarily defeat for certain.

The strongest person in the Chu Heavenly Clan apart from their Lord Clan Chief was their Supreme Elder, Chu Hanpeng. However, Chu Hanpeng only possessed the cultivation of a rank three Exalted.

“Bang, bang, bang~~~”

Suddenly, muffled explosions began to be heard. Then, a vast amount of blood began to sprinkle from the sky.

Those were all the people who had rushed to attack the Chu Heavenly Clan!!!

Powerful sword silhouettes had appeared out of nowhere. Not only were they very sharp, but there was also a lot of them.

Like rain, the swords swept across the sky and instantly obliterated the peak Martial Immortals, and even those rank three Exalted.

The five hundred plus experts who might have been able to massacre the Chu Heavenly Clan were all instantly killed.

In fact, not a single intact corpse remained.

“What happened?”

Seeing that, many people began to wonder what had happened.

After all, everything had happened too suddenly.

“Zzzzzz~~~”

At the moment when the crowd were confused, a figure appeared in the sky and landed before the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

“A person of the younger generation?”

Seeing the person who had landed, the expressions of many people changed.

They were able to instantly tell that the person who had appeared before the Chu Heavenly Clansmen and killed five hundred plus experts was a person of the younger generation.

When the crowd managed to get a clear look at that person’s face, an identical expression appeared on their faces -- extreme shock.

They recognized the person who had suddenly arrived.

“It’s Chu Feng!!!”
