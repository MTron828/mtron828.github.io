Chapter 4106 - Enormous Gift

Meanwhile in the Purple Star Hall.

Due to their fear of Long Daozhi, they’d been kneeling the entire time.

None of them actually dared to stand back up before dusk.

That said, kneeling so long would definitely be a very humiliating thing. This was especially so when they were being viewed by a bunch of people who were weaker than them. The embarrassment they felt was even more intense.

Because of that, in a rage, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master drove out all the other powers.

Finally, night arrived.

The Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and everyone else finally dared to stand back up.

Of course, this also included the Seven Stars Alliance’s Supreme Elder Lei Tong.

Lei Tong was seriously injured. As such, he did not leave at once, and instead decided to stay in the Purple Star Hall.

After standing back up, the people from the Purple Star Hall all returned to their posts.

Their lips were all sealed toward the humiliation they’d received today.

Even though they were acting like nothing had happened, they were feeling extremely upset in their hearts.

They felt as if their aloof egos had been crushed.

......

At this moment, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and his daughter Li Mengyue were inside a palace and chatting.

The content of their conversation was why Li Mengyue had decided to help Chu Feng even at the risk of death.

The Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master was confused about that.

After all, if it wasn’t for Chu Feng’s prompt aid, Li Mengyue might’ve died at the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master’s hands.

Upon learning the reason why, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master felt gratified.

It turned out that Li Mengyue did not help Chu Feng out of kindness. Rather, she had her own goal.

Li Mengyue felt that Chu Feng’s talent was pretty good, and he might be able to accomplish great things in the future. Because of that, if she could befriend him, it would be a good thing for her Purple Star Hall once he matured in the future.

That said, she had not anticipated that the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master would be that powerful.

If she had known that he might endanger her life, she would not have rashly gone to Chu Feng’s aid.

Of course, Li Mengyue had only cared about her Purple Star Hall the entire time.

That was also the reason why she did not attempt to dissuade her father when he tried to seize the cultivation treasure from Chu Feng.

After all, she also did not wish for him to take that cultivation treasure.

Even though they had promised it, she still did not wish for it to happen.

“Father, is that Long Daozhi really from the Dragon Clan?”

“If he’s from the Dragon Clan, why doesn’t he address himself as a member of the Dragon Clan, but instead as the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master?”

“He must be someone who was expelled by the Dragon Clan back then, no?” asked Li Mengyue.

Despite being relatively young, she was deeply knowledgeable of the matters of the Holy Light Galaxy.

Even though she acted frivolous, she was actually a very scheming person.

“Even if he was expelled by the Dragon Clan, he had the title plate of the Dragon Clan on him. That is equivalent to him having the protection of the Dragon Clan.”

“A single title plate is already enough to terrify the Seven Stars Alliance.”

“Thus, how could our Purple Star Hall possibly do anything?”

“That is the deterrence power of the Dragon Clan.”

“That said, the most terrifying of all would not be that Long Daozhi. Instead, it’s that Chu Feng.”

“That child’s talent is simply too terrifying. If he is allowed to mature, he will be beyond measure.”

“Our failure to eliminate him today will cause us no end of trouble.”

When his words reached this point, regret filled the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master’s face.

If he had known this would be the outcome, he would not have oppressed Chu Feng like he had.

Unfortunately, what had happened had happened. Even if he were to regret it now, it would be useless.

The only thing that made him rejoice was the friendly relationship between his daughter Li Mengyue and Chu Feng.

Regardless of what Li Mengyue’s intentions were, she had, at the very least on the surface, come to Chu Feng’s aid.

Because of that, he turned his gaze to Li Mengyue. “Mengyue, you are truly father’s most highly regarded child.”

“Judging from the situation now, your decision to befriend Chu Feng was the correct one.”

“Even if Chu Feng has an extremely bad impression of our Purple Star Hall and might even view us as enemies, his impression of you is at least decent.”

“In the future, if we want to neutralize this grievance, we will have to rely on you,” said the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master.

“Lord Father need not worry, I will look for an opportunity to get in contact with that Chu Feng.”

“He will not be able to escape my grasp.”

“He will not become our Purple Star Hall’s enemy. Instead, he will become our puppet.”

Li Mengyue had a look of confidence on her face as he said those words.

In fact, there was a trace of sinister intent present on her exceptionally beautiful face.

She was truly a poisonous beauty.

“Mengyue, you are truly father’s good daughter.”

Seeing Li Mengyue like this, a smile finally appeared on the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master’s face.

He had always viewed Li Mengyue as his successor.

The reason for that was not only because of her talent, but also because he was fond of her methods.

Suddenly, a female voice sounded from the palace hall, “Have Chu Feng become your puppet?”

“Who gave you that confidence?”

“Did you really think that brat Chu Feng is so easily deceived?”

Hearing that, a look of alarm appeared on the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and Li Mengyue’s faces.

The palace they were in was a forbidden area. Furthermore, the entrance to the palace hall was shut. There shouldn’t be anyone that could enter.

Yet, the voice they’d heard had definitely come from within the palace hall.

This meant that someone had breached their palace hall.

Realizing that whoever it was could not be looked down on, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master did not get angry.

Instead, he clasped his fist and asked with an extremely courteous tone, “May I know who this expert that came to our Purple Star Hall is?”

Once his words were said, a figure appeared and landed before them.

The person who had appeared before them was a little girl with long blonde hair.

The little girl appeared very young. She looked roughly thirteen years old. She was simply a child.

However, the world of martial cultivators was not one where people could judge another’s age by their appearance.

The Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master’s experience told him that this little girl before him, although extremely young in appearance, was very possibly an old monster that had trained for over ten thousand years.

Thus, afraid to be careless, he once again bowed respectfully. “May I know who senior is and why senior has come to my Purple Star Hall?”

“Senior?” The little girl revealed a strange smile.

“For the sake of finding me earlier, you all did not hesitate to take care of Chu Feng.”

“Why did you not recognize me when I appeared before you?”

As the little girl spoke, she was not only emitting golden light, but there was even lightning present on her.

At the same time, a sacred aura was released from her body.

Sensing that aura, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and Li Mengyue were both stunned.

Was that not the aura of the cultivation treasure from the Purple Star Variance Realm?

Could it be that the little girl before them was the cultivation treasure from the Purple Star Variance Realm?

“Senior, could it be that... you’re from the Purple Star Variance Realm?” the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master asked in a probing manner.

“That’s right. I am that so-called cultivation treasure you all yearned for day and night,” the little girl said with a smile.

Hearing those words, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and Li Mengyue were both stunned.

They were stunned with joy. They felt such immense joy that they did not know what to do.

They had thought that the cultivation treasure had been taken away by Chu Feng. Never did they expect for it to actually return.

This was completely beyond their anticipation.

“What’s this? Are you perhaps unhappy that I came to find you?” asked the little girl.

“Happy, happy.”

“So that Chu Feng didn’t deceive us. He really didn’t obtain senior,” the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master was so excited that he didn’t know what to do.

He was so happy that wrinkles covered his face.

“It’s good that you’re happy.”

“Your Purple Star Hall has waited for me for all these years. It hasn’t been easy.”

“As such, I’ve prepared an enormous gift for you all.”

“You can consider it my thanks to you all for waiting for me,” said the little girl.

“Enormous gift?”

Ecstasy covered the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and Li Mengyue’s faces after they heard that.

“You’ll understand once you look outside,” said the little girl.

The Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and Li Mengyue did not hesitate. They immediately turned their eyes to the outside of the palace.

Even though the palace was protected by a spirit formation that made it so that the people outside could not see the inside, the people inside could use special methods to see through the spirit formation and examine the situation outside.

“This...”

However, after they looked outside, the expressions of the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and Li Mengyue changed enormously. Their faces turned deathly pale.

They felt an enormous fear.

They discovered that the entire Purple Star Hall was devoid of life. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Everyone from the Purple Star Hall, including that Seven Stars Alliance’s Supreme Elder Lei Tong, had died.

Furthermore, the manner of their deaths was practically identical.

They had all died in a sinister manner. It was as if they all had their souls sucked dry.

All of them were reduced to sinister-looking mummies.

When they turned to the little girl again, the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master and Li Mengyue were so terrified that they felt it hard to even breathe.

They were shocked to discover that the seemingly sweet little girl before them was smiling with an extremely wicked smile.

“Do you like this gift of mine?” the little girl asked with a beaming smile.
