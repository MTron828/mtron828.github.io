Chapter 5491: The Right Decision

“Is that a name?” Eggy asked.

“That should be so,” Chu Feng replied.

“Why is there another name? Is someone competing with Little Fishy?” Eggy asked.

Supposing that the name on the stone monument signified that someone had dominated the region, the likeliest reason behind the previous name blurring out and another name appearing beside it was that Xianhai Yu’er had met her match.

Someone else had the power to conquer the Immemorial Star Sea too.

Most people shared the same thought as Chu Feng and Eggy.

Chu Feng focused on his ears to listen to others’ conversations. He learned that Xianhai Yu’er’s name had been the only name inscribed clearly on the stone monument. The blurring of Xianhai Yu’er’s name and the appearance of another person’s name happened recently. Unfortunately, it was impossible to make out the blurred name.

The weirdest thing of all was that the Immemorial Star Sea would at least open three days within ten days even though it wasn’t accessible every night, but ever since the changes on the stone monument, the Immemorial Star Sea hadn’t opened at all.

“Is this a sign that another prodigy has barged into the Immemorial Star Sea and become Xianhai Yu’er’s competitor?”

“What’s going on? Such a situation has never happened before!”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and its elders speculated on the situation as they sensed that this was something huge. The common consensus was that Xianhai Yu’er had met her match. A person whose name appeared on the stone monument was anything but normal.

“Did Little Fishy meet with trouble?” Chu Feng was worried.

Time ticked by. Specks of light began rising from the desert as the sky darkened, and it continued to grow increasingly brighter as the night deepened.

The crowd finally understood why this place was called the Immemorial Star Sea. The little specks of light that dotted this dark world were reminiscent of the stars in the sky.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At the same time, the stone monument that could only be viewed through special means in the day became visible via normal sight. It was still a far distance away, but it projected itself in a way that made it seem as if it was very close to them.

Xianhai Yu’er and her rival’s names were still blurry.

There were no obstacles preventing one from entering the Immemorial Star Sea, but it still gave off a feeling of utmost danger.

“Father, is it unsafe to enter the Immemorial Star Sea now too?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Yes. You’ll be subjected to immense pressure if you try to force your way in. You’d be lucky to get away with injuries; there are some who have died from it. Usually, when the Immemorial Star Sea opens, its sand will flow like seawater and a whirlpool with a powerful suction force will form around the stone monument. Anyone who steps into the Immemorial Star Sea will be dragged away by that suction force,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief explained.

Since it was impossible to enter the Immemorial Star Sea, the crowd simply spent a while admiring the scenery before returning to their respective rooms to rest. Before long, the only ones left on deck were Chu Feng and Long Muxi.

Long Muxi was slowly flipping through a book, whereas Chu Feng was still staring at the Immemorial Star Sea.

“Brother Chu Feng, why are you still staring at the Immemorial Star Sea? Did you notice something?”

Long Chengyu walked over with a side dish and a vat of alcohol in hand. He looked like he was planning to have a drink with Chu Feng.

“I believe so, but I’m not too sure. Shall we take a look?” Chu Feng asked.

Long Chengyu’s eyes lit up. Even Long Muxi tore her eyes away from her book to look at him.

“Brother Chu Feng, what did you notice?” Long Chengyu switched to communicating via voice transmission as if he was afraid that a third party would overhear their conversation.

“Let’s go and take a look,” Chu Feng said as he began making his way toward the Immemorial Star Sea.

Long Muxi and Long Chengyu followed him.

Despite knowing the dangers of the Immemorial Star Sea, the two of them didn’t hesitate to follow him. They harbored absolute trust in him.

There were two eyes gazing at their movements. One of them was the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, and the other was the chief of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors, Long Xu.

“Lord Clan Chief!” Long Xu exclaimed worriedly.

He knew that it was unsafe to enter the Immemorial Star Sea right now.

“Don’t worry. The three of them aren’t that weak,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Long Xu chose to watch the situation after hearing those words, but he was still worried nevertheless. He was surprised when he saw Chu Feng and the others advancing without the slightest change in their expression.

“Lord Clan Chief, why aren’t they meeting with any obstruction? Has the pressure from the Immemorial Star Sea faded?” Long Xu asked.

“Why don’t you go and take a try?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

Long Xu frowned. The Immemorial Star Sea was only accessible to juniors. Cultivators beyond a certain age would face tremendous pressure that immediately halted their advancement. He had once tried to enter the Immemorial Star Sea even after surpassing a hundred years of age, and he never wanted to experience again what he did back then.

Besides, the fact that the clan chief said such words meant that the pressure was still there.

All of a sudden, Long Xu thought of something and asked, “Did they discover a special road into the Immemorial Star Sea?”

Now that he thought about it, Chu Feng hadn’t been navigating into the Immemorial Star Sea in a straight path. Rather, he seemed to be walking down a winding path, sometimes heading left and sometimes heading right.

“Didn’t Chu Feng already mention that he noticed something?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief pointed out.

“Given his cultivation, it doesn’t make sense for him to notice something that no one else has,” Long Xu exclaimed in agitation.

No one would have believed this if he said it aloud, but it didn’t seem that inconceivable when he thought about Chu Feng’s past track record. First he conquered the God Armaments, then he obtained the God Taboo Martial Skill for the Totem Dragon Clan. Those were feats that none had ever achieved in the Totme Dragon Clan.

It didn’t seem unthinkable for him to discover a road through the Immemorial Star Sea that no one else had. This showed that his performance wasn’t just luck; he was a true prodigy.

“I don’t know what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master wants us to do, but I know that it’s the right decision to bring Chu Feng with us,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief remarked.

There was a hint of amazement in his eyes too.
