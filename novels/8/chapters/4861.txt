Chapter 4861: So This Is a Prodigy?

Back then, when Shengguang Xuanye entered an ancient remnant, he obtained a few ancient treasures and learned two ancient formations.

These two formations were related to cultivation, and those ancient treasures were required to construct them.

One was a malevolent formation that converted a cultivator’s bloodline into a cultivation resource. Shengguang Xuanye was preparing it to use on Long Xiaoxiao.

The other one was a cultivation formation used to enhance one’s intelligence, thus refining one’s control over martial skills.

This cultivation formation was much more complicated than the malevolent assimilation formation. It needed to be catalyzed by the ancient treasure and a huge amount of special liquid known as Condensed Divine Dew.

Condensed Divine Dew wasn’t something that could be found in the natural world; it had to be concocted through a complicated process.

Nevertheless, Shengguang Xuanye still spent a great deal of time, effort, and resources to concoct the Condensed Divine Dew. Over the last 1300 years, he successfully concocted enough of this precious fluid to form a boundless lake.

The beautiful swan-like palace they were in was the ancient treasure catalyzing the cultivation formation. All of the required elements were already in place.

The thought of taking away the cultivation formation that Shengguang Xuanye had prepared for over a thousand years filled Chu Feng with glee.

To be honest, he ought to have escaped as soon as he managed to secure Long Xiaoxiao’s mother since he was in enemy territory. Yet, he continued to linger in the area because he realized that the cultivation formation was extraordinary. He wanted to use it.

“How can the cultivation formation be activated?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young hero Chu Feng, the formation can be activated through setting up an activation formation and fusing it with a droplet of the Condensed Divine Dew. I’ll tell you the method, but please don’t blame me if you aren’t able to do it.

“The process is extremely complicated, so it can be hard to pull off. To be honest with you, no one in the clan has been able to activate it thus far. There are doubts that the activation method might be wrong, but no one can tell for sure,” Shengguang Yunyue said.

Chu Feng didn’t think that Shengguang Yunyue was lying to him. It was unlikely for her to do so given how afraid she was of him, especially when there was no one to save her at the moment.

Besides, he had also been looking around the place and couldn’t find the activation method either. If the activation method was truly easy, he would have already found a way by now.

“Young friend Chu Feng, my speed will be slow as I’ve already lost my cultivation. Please don’t mind it,” Shengguang Yunyue said as she took out a dagger from her Cosmos Sack and started writing on the floor.

She was no different from a mortal now that her cultivation had been crippled by Chu Feng.

It was something she could have completed with a wave of her hand previously, but she could only manually carve the runes on the floor with her dagger now. Nevertheless, it didn’t take her long to finish carving out the formation blueprint despite her primitive method.

Chu Feng took a look at the formation blueprint. He could tell that the blueprint complemented the cultivation formation, a hint that Shengguang Yunyue hadn’t been lying to him.

He pointed his hand at the entrance and pulled a droplet of Condensed Divine Dew right in front of him. Then, he started constructing a formation based on Shengguang Yunyue’s blueprint.

The activation formation was actually not too complicated, such that it only took Chu Feng a split second to complete the construction process.

All that was left now was to fuse the droplet of Condensed Divine Dew with the activation formation, though it was still a huge question mark whether it would really work or not.

Unexpectedly, when Chu Feng tried to fuse the two together, he felt a strong blockade that hindered the fusion. He was unable to carry out this step.

A contemplative frown surfaced on his forehead. He tried altering the formation, but he was still unable to catalyze the fusion between the formation and the Condensed Divine Dew.

Unwilling to give up, he continued trying and trying.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I-I didn’t lie to you! I’ve tried it before, and I was clearly able to fuse the two easily. This doesn’t make sense!”

Shengguang Yunyue was appalled to see Chu Feng’s failure. She was afraid that he would blame her for it, so she hurriedly tried to explain herself.

Chu Feng ignored her and continued altering the formation to push the fusion.

Meanwhile, a glint flashed across Shengguang Haifu’s eyes. He secretly sent a voice transmission to Shengguang Yunyue.

“I finally get it now, Lord Yunyue. You’re doing this on purpose. You gave him an inaccurate activation formation so as to stall time for our clan chief to appear,” he said.

Shengguang Yunyue stared at Shengguang Haifu with a speechless look on her face.

She knew deep well that she hadn’t lied to Chu Feng. It was not that she didn’t want to but she dared not to. The pain she had suffered in the hands of those black snakes and human-faced spiders were not something she would ever want to experience a second time.

Soon, cold sweat started flowing down Chu Feng’s back, and he started becoming irritable.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I really didn’t lie to you!”

Shengguang Yunyue’s fear was intensifying with each passing second. She was afraid that Chu Feng would blame her for his failure.

“Shut up!” Chu Feng roared furiously.

Those words scared Shengguang Yunyue into silence. She was afraid that the unbearable torture would begin again if she let out another word.

“Chu Feng, calm down. Take it slow,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother spoke up.

She noticed that something was amiss here. Chu Feng’s condition didn’t look too good, and it looked like he might suffer a cultivation deviation if this went on.

“Elder, please give me some space. I need to focus on this.”

Unexpectedly, Chu Feng wasn’t even listening to Long Xiaoxiao’s mother either. He didn’t sound angry, but this was unlike him.

Long Xiaoxiao’s mother dared not to interrupt Chu Feng anymore.

This further convinced Shengguang Haifu of his theory that this was Shengguang Yunyue’s ploy, and he took it as a sign that her ploy was already on the verge of success.

Weng!

All of a sudden, the distance between Chu Feng’s activation formation and the droplet of Condensed Divine Dew closed in.

Woosh! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Raging waves could be heard outside.

Shengguang Haifu looked out of the palace and was dumbstruck by what he saw.

Even Shengguang Yunyue found it hard to believe her eyes.

The lake that had remained calm for over the past thousand years had started raging. Despite being in the higher echelons of the Holy Light Clan, this was the first time they were seeing something like this happening to the cultivation formation.

One must know that Shengguang Xuanye had tried countless times to activate this cultivation formation, but not once had he caused such a stir.

“Why would this happen? Lord Yunyue, what did you do?!”

Shengguang Fuhai glared at Shengguang Yunyue with eyes filled with reproach. He realized that Shengguang Yunyue was not trying to play Chu Feng like a fiddle; she was really helping him!

There was no doubt that Shengguang Yunyue had told him the truth, or else it wouldn’t have caused such a stir here.

“Are you an idiot? Open your eyes and take a good look! Is there anything different about the formation I’ve carved on the floor? Stop prattling off over there!”

Shengguang Yunyue couldn’t stand Shengguang Fuhai anymore and roared at him. She knew that informing Chu Feng of the activation formation was a betrayal to her clan, but she didn’t think that she was responsible for the commotion Chu Feng was causing.

The activation formation she had imparted to Chu Feng was the same that Shengguang Xuanye had used many times before, just that he had failed miserably each and every time. She, too, had no idea what was causing the difference here.

Was this the difference between a true prodigy and the rest of them?
