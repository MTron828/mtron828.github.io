Chapter 5242: Prodigy Against Prodigy

“Was he the one who caused those anomalies? Just how insanely talented is he?”

While the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were suffering a mental breakdown, the onlookers were amazed by what they were seeing. This left the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen feeling even more humiliated.

“I can help you if you wish to save them. It’s not too late for me to intervene before that man absorbs all of the spirit beasts’ spirit power,” Tang Xiu suddenly spoke up.

He knew that the Situ World Spiritist Clan possessed a way for outsiders to enter the formation, just that they refused to divulge it because they didn’t want to share the resource. But now that their prodigies were already facing the threat of death, they had to let him in.

“Young master Tang, please get rid of that bastard for us.”

Just as he had expected, Situ Tingye took out a guest token and passed it to Tang Xiu without any hesitation. That exposed Situ Tingye’s earlier lie about there being no more guest tokens, but Tang Xiu accepted the guest token without harping on that matter.

However, instead of entering the formation right away, he said, “I have a condition.”

Situ Tingye and the others were taken aback.

“What conditions do you have?” Situ Tingye asked.

“Any spirit beasts I hunt down inside the formation will be mine,” Tang Xiu said.

Situ Tingye and the others felt indignant, but there was no way around it.

If Tang Xiu didn’t enter the formation, Chu Feng would claim the power of the spirit beasts and massacre all of their prodigies. That would spell the end of their Situ World Spiritist Clan.

“You can do whatever you like as long as you get rid of that man!” Situ Tingye gritted his teeth and said.

“Rest assured. That man won’t stand a chance now that I’m making a move,” Tang Xiu replied before vanishing on the spot.

By the time he reappeared, he was already inside the spirit beast mountain range. He was able to pass through the formation with the guest token, and he was well on his way toward the center area where Chu Feng and the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan were at.

It would be meaningless for him to kill Chu Feng after he had absorbed all of the spirit beasts’ spirit power. After all, he was doing this to get a slice of the pie too.

“Hm?”

All of a sudden, the spirit power that Chu Feng hadn’t absorbed yet reverted back to their spirit beast form. The juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan were confused as to what was going on.

Chu Feng had simply stopped the absorption because he sensed someone approaching.

Soon, a person appeared within his line of sight. It was Tang Xiu.

“Not bad. You actually noticed me.”

Chu Feng’s eyes were fixated on Tang Xiu, indicating that he had sensed his arrival.

“It’s you,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Not knowing the reason behind Chu Feng’s smile, Tang Xiu was oblivious to the danger he was in.

“Are you going to end your own life, or do you need me to do it for you?” Tang Xiu said.

He was extremely confident in himself.

“There’s no grudge between us. Are you sure you want to stand up for the Situ World Spiritist Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

“So what if that’s the case?” Tang Xiu replied arrogantly.

“That would be for the best.”

Chu Feng was extremely protective of those whom he considered his friends. He had been wanting to stand up for Shengguang Daokui after learning about the conflict between him and Tang Xiu, but his initial plan was just to teach Tang Xiu a lesson since there wasn’t a grudge between them.

However, Tang Xiu’s response changed his mind. He decided to end Tang Xiu’s life here for the sole reason that the latter was here to take his life. Those who planned to murder others should be ready to be killed themselves.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng drew the Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

“You aren’t going to use your spirit power?”

Tang Xiu was surprised. He thought that Chu Feng’s core was a world spiritist considering how adept he was at world spirit techniques, but Chu Feng seemed to be planning to fight him with martial power instead.

“Does it matter? You’re going to be defeated whether I resort to spirit power or martial power anyway,” Chu Feng replied.

“Hahaha!” Tang Xiu burst into laughter. “Do you take me to be the same as them?”

He glanced at the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan as he said those words, which made their complexions darken.

As prodigies of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, how could they stand being made light of by someone else? However, there was nothing they could say in rebuttal since Tang Xiu was indeed stronger than them.

“There’s no difference to me,” Chu Feng replied.

“Arrogant bastard. Those who dare to act up before me deserve to die!”

Unable to stand it anymore, Tang Xiu drew the saber behind his back. With a powerful hack, he tore a huge hole through the barrier Chu Feng had constructed earlier before charging at Chu Feng himself.

Chu Feng brandished his sword to face Tang Xiu.

He had never been afraid of frontal confrontations before.

“Run!”

Without any hesitation, the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan made use of this opportunity to flee from the scene. They ran straight toward the hole in the barrier…

Weng!

… but by the time they arrived, the hole had already disappeared.

“He’s multitasking?”

Their faces turned bitter. They knew that they wouldn’t be able to breach Chu Feng’s barrier, which meant that they could only pin their hopes on Tang Xiu.

“How are the two of them that powerful? Will Tang Xiu be able to win the fight?”

The more they watched the duel, the more unnerved they felt. Even though their cultivation had already been suppressed to rank one Martial Exalted level, they were still unable to see through Chu Feng and Tang Xiu’s movements. To make things worse, they could tell that they were fighting without resorting to any martial skills at all.

“There’s no need to panic. It’s not as if we haven’t heard of how powerful Tang Xiu is. That bastard might have been able to subdue us with his unorthodox means, but those tricks wouldn’t work on Tang Xiu. Besides, Tang Xiu specializes in close-quarter combat. That bastard is truly foolish to dare confront Tang Xiu face-on,” Situ Jingchuan said.

Those words settled the unnerved hearts of the juniors.

Shoosh!

All of a sudden, a figure flew across the air and crashed onto the barrier. The impact was so great that it cracked the barrier.

The juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan quickly turned their eyes over, only to be shocked by what they had seen. It was Tang Xiu!

Blood was seeping from the corner of his mouth, and there was a footprint on his chest.

The juniors quickly turned their eyes over to Chu Feng, and they were astonished to find him completely unharmed.

“Is this all you’re capable of?” Chu Feng asked.

“Shit! Again!”

Refusing to accept his loss, Tang Xiu brandished his saber and charged at Chu Feng.

“How is he that powerful? Tang Xiu is known for his skills with the saber, but he’s unable to withstand that man’s swordsmanship?”

An uproar broke out amongst the onlookers outside the formation.

The juniors inside the formation were unable to see through the battle due to their cultivation being suppressed, but those outside were able to tell just how ingenious Chu Feng’s swordsmanship was despite the suppression of his cultivation.

It filled them with awe.

“Is that person’s name Chu Feng? Why have I never heard of him before?”

Chu Feng had won over the crowd with his sheer strength.

“It’s no surprise you have never heard of him before. He isn’t from the Totem Galaxy but the Holy Light Galaxy!” Shengguang Daokui murmured gleefully under his breath,

He looked at Chu Feng and clenched his fists in excitement.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you’re the hope of our Holy Light Galaxy.

Just then, Tang Xiu was sent crashing into the barrier by another kick.

This time around, before he could get up, Chu Feng suddenly appeared in front of him and plunged the Immemorial Hero’s Sword into his chest.

Pu!

The sword penetrated Tang Xiu’s heart and the barrier behind him.

“This!!!”

The crowd was shocked beyond words. Everything fell completely silent.

That was a fatal blow.

Was the renowned prodigy, Tang Xiu, going to die just like that?

Chu Feng confirmed that Tang Xiu had stopped breathing before attempting to grab his Cosmos Sack.

Shoosh!

Tang Xiu suddenly swept his saber outward. It was fortunate that Chu Feng had reacted fast and swiftly leaped out of the way, but even so, he was still left with a bloodied gash in his chest.

“You aren’t dead yet?”

Chu Feng was surprised.

The earlier fatal attack should have claimed Tang Xiu’s life, and he had confirmed that the latter had stopped breathing. However, he quickly noticed a powerful surge of medicinal energy enveloping Tang Xiu.

“What powerful medicinal energy! Did that medicinal energy save his life?” Chu Feng deduced.

“You knave! You wasted the Life Protection Sacred Pill that my master gave me!”

Those words affirmed Chu Feng’s guess. The medicinal energy had indeed protected Tang Xiu from the fatal attack, just that Tang Xiu had chosen to feign death and wait for Chu Feng to loosen his guard so as to launch a counterattack.

To his disappointment, Chu Feng managed to get away with just superficial injuries.

“It sure is good to have a good master. You even have a pill to protect yourself from a fatal attack. However, if I’m not mistaken, the pill should only work once, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Once is more than enough,” Tang Xiu replied confidently.

He then raised his voice and shouted, “If you want to save your juniors, release the cultivation suppression barrier. I’m going to use my true strength now!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Those words were directed at Situ Tingye, and the latter heard those words loud and clear. Without any hesitation, he deactivated the formation suppressing the juniors’ cultivation.

Having regained his true strength, Tang Xiu’s face lit up in confidence. His body began to emanate a blue aura, and a massive blue beast could be vaguely seen behind him. At the same time, dark clouds began filling the sky.

Tang Xiu was originally at rank nine Martial Exalted level. By activating his Divine Power, he was able to raise his fighting prowess by a cultivation rank.

Grar!

A furious roar echoed, and Tang Xiu’s aura intensified. Another massive blue beast formed behind him, raising his fighting prowess by yet another cultivation rank. He now had a Heaven-defying Battle Power of two levels.

“Incredible! As expected of Tang Xiu!”

Tang Xiu’s show of might inspired confidence amongst the despaired juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. The onlookers were also full of compliments for Tang Xiu.

“Die!”

With a roar, Tang Xiu hacked his saber down on Chu Feng. He wasn’t using a martial skill, but that didn’t mean that he was holding back either. He was simply confident that he could defeat Chu Feng with his superior cultivation.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng lightly swung his Immemorial Hero’s Sword, and the released sword qi utterly decimated Tang Xiu’s attack.

“Do you think that you’re the only one in the world who is able to raise your fighting prowess?” Chu Feng sneered.

The crowd took a closer look at Chu Feng, only to be shocked by what they saw.

Chu Feng was equipped with both the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor, and there were four beast avatars manifested around him. Every single one of his beast avatars was stronger than Tang Xiu’s massive blue beasts.

Through these means, he raised his fighting prowess by three cultivation ranks, putting him on the same cultivation rank as Tang Xiu.

It was already shocking enough that someone was able to simultaneously invoke the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor, to think that Chu Feng possessed a Divine Power on top of that.

This was truly overpowered!

“How in the world is he that powerful?”

The faces of Situ Tingye and the others turned pale.
