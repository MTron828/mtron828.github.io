Chapter 4624: Infuriated

Gah!

Guttural cries reminiscent of the death throes of slaughtered pigs echoed in the air. These sounds were coming from the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.

The formation beast tightened its grip around the two of them, and the thorns on its palms began to extend too, piercing right through their bodies.

Crimson blood flowed down from its palms like flowing water, dripping down on the floor.

“Yuntian... Save... Save us...”

The two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan pleaded desperately with Gongsun Yuntian with a feeble voice.

All of the prodigies on the other side of the communication formation grew anxious at this side. They didn’t think that Chu Feng would actually be so brazen as to harm their kin right before their eyes.

One must know that those in this palace right now weren’t ordinary people. They were all prodigies highly valued within the Gongsun Clan, the future pillars of the clan.

And in truth, even Xiao Yu and Xia Yan were astonished too. They didn’t think that Chu Feng would actually be this arrogant.

“Stop right now! Stop!’

Even Gongsun Yuntian was unable to keep his calm anymore. He roared at Chu Feng furiously, as if trying to intimidate the latter.

“Stop? Do you really expect me to heed your command? Do you think that the world revolves around your Gongsun Clan? Let me tell you this outright, I wasn’t planning to go this far in the first place. I was going to let them off after teaching them a quick lesson.

“However, despite knowing that your own kin has done wrong, instead of admitting your own faults, you chose to threaten me instead. Such intimidation might work on others, but not on me, Chu Feng!’

Right after saying those words, Chu Feng clenched his fists tightly together, and his action was mirrored by the formation beast as well. Its claws tightened, and the creaking of bones could be heard echoing loudly in the hall. Then, with loud snaps, the bones of the two prodigies were crushed.

“This brother over here, hurry up and stop! We know our wrong now, and we’re willing to admit our mistakes. Besides, the one who threatened you earlier wasn’t us. Please, let us off!”

The two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan finally put down their pride to beg with Chu Feng for mercy.

Seeing this, a slight smile formed on Chu Feng’s lips. He stopped the formation beast from exerting more pressure, but he didn’t let them off just like that.

“Since you have admitted to your faults, I, Chu Feng, am not an unreasonable person either. However, those brothers of yours have really displeased me greatly. If they apologize to me, I can let the two of you off. Otherwise, I’m afraid that it’ll be hard for my rage to be quelled.”

Chu Feng shot a glance at the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan beyond the mirror when he said those words.

“A trash like you wants us to apologize to you? Dream on!”

However, right after Chu Feng said those words, the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan sneered in disdain. Faced with their disdain, Chu Feng simply shrugged lightly before turning to look at the two prodigies suffering in the grip of the formation beast.

“Do the two of you have a grudge with your brethren?” Chu Feng asked.

“Ah?”

Those two prodigies were confused by Chu Feng’s question.

“If there isn’t any grudge, why are they so eager to send you to your death? They’re intentionally hurling insults to agitate me. They could have easily saved your lives just by apologizing, but they decided to do the contrary instead. Surely true brothers wouldn’t do something like this to one another?” Chu Feng asked.

“You dog! Stop trying to sow discord amongst us here!”

The other prodigies of the Gognsun Clan behind the mirror bellowed at Chu Feng angrily.

“See what I mean? It looks like they really want the two of you dead.”

Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed coldly as the smile finally vanished from his lips.

The chilling aura that Chu Feng was giving off at this very moment scared the two prodigies out of their wits. Squeezed between the claws of the formation beast, what was flowing out of them was no longer just blood but some unidentified fluid too.

To be honest, they also thought very little of Chu Feng prior to this, but their opinion had made a 360-degrees turn now.

They realized that there was more to this seemingly ordinary fellow than they expected. This fellow wasn’t afraid of the Gongsun Clan at all. There was no doubt that he had the guts to kill the two of them.

“Stop talking nonsense here and quickly apologize! Do you really want to see us dead?”

“Yuntian, please keep them in check! If they don’t apologize, we’ll really die!”

The two prodigies began howling at their own brethren.

A hint of hesitation flickered across Gongsun Yuntian’s face. To be honest, apologizing wasn’t that big of a deal, but the problem was that they were offspring of the great Gongsun Clan. if they lowered their heads to Chu Feng here, it would be equivalent to the Gongsun Clan lowering its head too.

The clan’s pride was at stake here.

“You all, apologize to him.”

But in the end, Gongsun Yuntian still relented.

“Fine. Treat it as if we have misspoken.”

The other prodigies who had provoked Chu Feng earlier were reluctant to apologize, but given that it was Gongsun Yuntian telling them to do so, they had no choice but to obey. However, they made sure to display their reluctance in its full glory in their ‘apology’; unwillingness was written all over their faces, and there was a grudging edge to their voice too.

Heck, they weren’t even bothering to look at Chu Feng at all!

“Is this how you apologize? Am I supposed to accept such an insincere apology?”

Needless to say, Chu Feng wasn’t going to show them any face if this was all they had.

“What else do you want? Stop pushing your luck!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The other prodigies immediately lashed back in dissatisfaction.

“Show some sincerity.”

Before Chu Feng could refute them, Gongsun Yuntian had spoken up once more, and his tone was much more severe this time around. It was indubitably an order.

Panic immediately showed on the faces of the prodigies. It could be seen that they were actually very frightened of Gongsun Yuntian.

“Our tone wasn’t right earlier. Brother, show some magnanimity and let them off.”

So, the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan spoke up once more. They were still very reluctant, but at least they had softened their stance greatly from before. Their attitude was much better this time around.

“That won’t do. It’s still too insincere. You should at least kneel down.”

Yet, who could have thought that the troublemaker, Xia Yan, would suddenly interject at this moment?

“You...”

Upon hearing those words, the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan gritted their teeth furiously. However, out of fear that Chu Feng would vent his anger on their kin, they swallowed their words back down and held their tongue.

Xia Yan’s playful voice had made it clear that he was just teasing them, and it wasn’t an actual demand.

“There’s no need for you to kneel down, but you aren’t the only ones who insulted me earlier. Gongsun Yuntian, you asked your kin to apologize, but what about you?”

Chu Feng shot a narrowed glance at Gongsun Yuntian.

This remark shocked not just the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, Xia Yan, and Xiao Yu but the two prodigies who were held in Chu Feng’s grasp too.

It was still possible to get the other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan to apologize, but Gongsun Yuntian? He was like a lofty dragon towering above the others, so how could he possibly lower his head to others?

Besides, Gongsun Yuntian was a proud person too. There was a much better chance at finding a needle in a haystack than to make him apologize!

“You really are tired of living.”

A cold glint flashed across Gongsun Yuntian’s eyes.

As everyone expected, Gongsun Yuntian had no intention to apologize at all.

“So, you’re really intending to leave them to the lurch?” Chu Feng replied frankly.

“Kill the two of them then. However, I can promise you that your entire clan will pay the cost of your actions,” Gongsun Yuntian sneered coldly.

His face had turned completely livid, and his eyes were utterly cold. Even though they were divided by a formation, everyone present could feel his raging killing intent.

Chu Feng had provoked the strongest prodigy of the Gongsun Clan!
