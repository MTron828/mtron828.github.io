Chapter 5351: Three Seas of the Immemorial Era

Old Man Zhou was initially guarded against the white-robed old man who had suddenly appeared before him, but when he saw the other party’s face, his eyes visibly widened a little. He quickly got to his knees and bowed deeply, “Paying respects to milord.”

“It really is you. Who could have thought that the renowned Deranged Zhou Exalted would be living in seclusion at a place like this?” the white-robed old man said with a chuckle.

“Milord, are you here to look for me?” Old Man Zhou asked.

“Yes, I am going to do something very soon. Come back and help me,” the white-robed old man said.

“Milord, I have grown weary of fighting. I have already told you that when I left back then. I humbly request…” Old Man Zhou wanted to turn down the order, but the white-robed old man interjected before he could finish his sentence.

“I know that your Zhou Clan suffered heavy losses in that battle.” As he said those words, the white-robed old man looked toward the Unageing Peak. “I can see that your Zhou Clan does have talented individuals. Is that lad on that mountain peak your grandson?”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Old Man Zhou also turned his gaze toward the Unageing Peak. It was only then that he realized other than his grandson Zhou Zhi, there was another young man on the peak… and the young man was emanating the spirit power of an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. 

That was power comparable to a rank seven Half-God level cultivator.

Old Man Zhou was shocked, for he could tell that the young man was indeed a junior.

The fact that a junior possessed such powerful spirit power showed just how terrifyingly talented the young man was. While the young man was not the only one to have reached this height at such a young age—there was another one in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion—it was surprising because this young man had come out of nowhere. 

“Milord, are the rumors true?” Old Man Zhou looked at the white-robed old man with a conflicted gaze. 

The white-robed old man chuckled. Instead of answering the question, he opened up his palm and released numerous glowing insects reminiscent of fireflies. These glowing insects emanated powerful spirit power.

“The Spirit Flies of the Saint Realm. Milord, you really managed to acquire it?”

Old Man Zhou couldn’t believe his eyes. All along, he had thought that this was nothing more than a legend. 

“I didn’t just acquire it; I acquired a lot of it. Your grandson is talented. I am certain that he’ll be able to quickly advance his spirit power and restore honor to your Zhou Clan with these Saint Realm’s Spirit Flies,” the white-robed elder said.

Old Man Zhou was moved. He knew what these Spirit Flies represented.

“And this will be the last time. Once you accomplish the task I ask of you, I’ll permit you to retire and live the leisurely life you want,” the white-robed old man added. 

“I am willing to brave through danger for milord,” Old Man Zhou lowered his head and said.

The white-robed old man finally revealed a satisfied smile. He stepped forward and supported Old Man Zhou back to his feet.

“Stand up. We’ll be doing something big this time around. Your Zhou Clan will leave its mark in history,” the white-robed old man said.

“Milord, what are you intending to do?” Old Man Zhou asked.

“No rush. I’ll fill you in on the details later,” the white-robed old man said. He turned his gaze toward the Unageing Peak and asked, “Did someone manage to awaken the Life Crystal?”

“Yes, it’s a junior named Chu Feng,” Old Man Zhou replied.

“Do you know his background?” the white-robed old man asked. 

“I don’t know his background, but I heard that he’s from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Not too long ago, he won the Trial of the Strongest hosted by the Totem Dragon Clan and became dubbed as the strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator,” Old Man Zhou said.

“Events hosted by the Totem Dragon Clan are nothing more than child’s play,” the white-robed old man scoffed. He clearly didn’t think highly of the Totem Dragon Clan. “Nevertheless, the fact that he was able to awaken the Life Crystal shows that he’s rather talented.” 

“Milord, do you intend to bring him under your wing?” Old Man Zhou asked.

“There’s no rush. Let’s wait and see for the time being. What he has displayed thus far isn’t enough to prove his qualification. There’s no lack of prodigies in God’s Era. Even prodigies of that tier have appeared in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan,” the white-robed old man remarked.

“Indeed. God’s Era sure is frightening. So many monstrously talented individuals are appearing in droves every now and then,” Old Man Zhou said with a sigh.

“That’s what makes things interesting. Give these to your grandson first and wait for my news.” The white-robed old man tossed some Spirit Flies to Old Man Zhou before leaving the room.

At the same time, the young man on the Unageing Peak suddenly vanished into thin air. Zhou Zhi was taken aback by the other party’s sudden disappearance, till Old Man Zhou appeared beside him.

“Grandfather, didn’t you go into closed-door training?” Zhou Zhi asked.

“I’m afraid that I won’t be able to go into closed-door training anymore,” Old Man Zhou replied.

“Grandfather, did you see that person? Is he really a junior like me?” Zhou Zhi asked. 

“Yes, he is a junior,” Old Man Zhou replied.

“He really is a junior? How is it possible for a junior to reach such a level of spirit power?” Zhou Zhi was startled.

“He’s no ordinary junior,” Old Man Zhou replied.

“Grandfather, you know him? Who is he?” Zhou Zhi asked. It had finally dawned upon him that the young man whom he had just met earlier was a formidable individual.

“Since he has made an appearance, it’s only a matter of time before he becomes known throughout the world of cultivation. You’ll naturally find out who he is then,” Old Man Zhou replied.

Meanwhile, the white-robed old man and the young man traversed across the realm’s boundary and arrived in space. 

“Tian’er, where do you want to cultivate?” the white-robed old man asked.

“I wish to head to the Immemorial Star Sea,” the young man replied.

“The Immemorial Star Sea? Why not the Immemorial Realm Sea?” the white-robed old man asked.

“Don’t you think that the Immemorial Star Sea is much more interesting?” the young man asked.

“That lass isn’t an easy one to deal with,” the white-robed old man said.

“That’s precisely the reason I want to head there,” the young man replied.

The white-robed old man revealed a satisfied smile upon hearing that answer. With a wave of his sleeves, a gigantic bird resembling a phoenix manifested beside him. The two of them ascended on the phoenix’s back and headed toward the depths of the vast world of cultivation.

On the other hand, Chu Feng’s group had entered an ancient teleportation formation and was swiftly making their way toward the Bloodline Galaxy.

“Big brother Chu Feng and esteemed elders, have you heard about the incident at the Immemorial Star Sea?” Bai Yunqing suddenly asked.

“Immemorial Star Sea? Did something happen there?” the four daoists asked.

“Elders, I’m surprised that you haven’t heard of it yet. It looks like my news is more current,” Bai Yunqing gleefully said.

“You seem excited,” Chu Feng remarked. 

“Big brother Chu Feng, something huge has happened. I only just heard it from my senior uncle myself. I don’t think the news has spread yet, but it’ll soon be known throughout the vast world of cultivation. I reckon that the top prodigies won’t be able to sleep anymore once they hear about it!” Bai Yunqing said.

“You’re acting all secretive. So, what happened at the Immemorial Star Sea?” Chu Feng asked.

“Big brother Chu Feng, have you heard of the Three Seas of the Immemorial Era?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“I haven’t.” Chu Feng shook his head.

“The Three Seas of the Immemorial Era are namely the Immemorial Realm Sea, Immemorial Star Sea, and Immemorial Massacre Sea. These three seas are rumored to be places of trial back in the Immemorial Era, and they are currently dubbed as the three most dangerous seas in the world of cultivation. Anyone who manages to conquer any of the seas will be allowed to leave their name on the stone tablet located at the seas’ entrances, which is why all of the juniors of the world of cultivation are looking to conquer them to prove themselves,” Bai Yunqing said. 

“I see.” Chu Feng nodded.

“There have been doubts about the authenticity of the rumors as no one has conquered any of the three seas before, but those doubts were quelled when that person came and conquered the Immemorial Realm Sea, leaving her name on the stone tablet at the sea’s entrance… and I bet that you have heard about her before,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Who is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“She is dubbed as the greatest prodigy ever seen in the world of cultivation, Lord Jie Ranqing!” Bai Yunqing said.

Chu Feng felt his blood rushing when he heard that name. How could he possibly not have heard about Jie Ranqing?

“Big brother Chu Feng, it can’t be that you haven’t heard of Lord Jie Ranqing too?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“I have heard about her,” Chu Feng replied.

Bai Yunqing heaved a sigh of relief. “Of course. As a prodigious world spiritist yourself, how could you have possibly not heard about Lord Jie Ranqing?”

“Tell me more about it,” Chu Feng urged.

“Lord Jie Ranqing challenged the Three Seas of the Immemorial Era back when she was still a junior, but even with her talents, she has only managed to conquer the Immemorial Realm Sea. The Immemorial Star Sea and Immemorial Massacre Sea were beyond her means to deal with.

“But not too long ago, someone has successfully conquered the Immemorial Star Sea, evident by how her name is carved on the stone tablet at the sea’s entrance,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Are you serious? Who was the one to conquer the Immemorial Star Sea?” The four daoists could hardly believe what they were hearing.

Chu Feng could tell from their expressions that this was a huge matter.

Bai Yunqing was all the more gleeful upon seeing how he had successfully built up tension amongst the listeners. He took his time to clear his throat before finally revealing the answer, “Her name is Xianhai Yu’er.”
