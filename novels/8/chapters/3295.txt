Chapter 3295 - Su Rou, Su Mei

The person that Chu Feng was focused on was a middle-aged looking man. He had a slightly wretched appearance, and belonged to the sort that appeared very indecent and unreliable. As for his cultivation, it was at the Heavenly Immortal realm.

As for his actual age, he should be close to a thousand years old.

Someone like him would be considered to be a very ordinary martial cultivator.

At that moment, that middle-aged man was standing with several close friends. He was gesticulating and spitting all over the place as he narrated some things to them.

As for what he was telling them, it was in regards to the strange matter happening in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm. That said, what he was talking about was the appearance of the two women.

Currently, those two women were the most important points of interest to everyone in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm. As for their appearances, they too were something that the crowd were all very interested in.

As such, when that middle-aged man began to give an account of their appearance, the surrounding people all began to listen closely to his narrative.

According to him, those two women were not only very young, but they also had appearances like that of celestial fairies. They were beauties so devastatingly beautiful that they could cause the downfall of cities and states. When men saw them, they would definitely feel their heartbeat accelerate, and let their imagination run wild. Those two women were such alluring beauties.

One of the women was very sexy and enticing. She gave off the airs of an imperial older sister.

As for the other woman, she was very pure and charming. She resembled a fairy that had descended upon the mortal world.

Although the two beauties were of completely different styles, their appearances were very similar, and resembled that of sisters. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After hearing that middle-aged man’s descriptions, many people began to doubt his account. Not only did the bystanders smile and then begin to walk away, but even his friends had expressions of disbelief on their faces.

The reason for that was because the Wuma Heavenly Clan had never published any portraits of the two women. As such, there were many rumors as to how the two women looked. Merely, the majority of the rumors were very vague.

Yet, that middle-aged man’s description was very detailed, so detailed that he could simply imprint the two women’s appearances into the crowd’s heads with mere words.

However, it was precisely because his descriptions were so detailed that the crowd felt that he was making things up.

As for the middle-aged man, he was naturally unwilling to give in to the crowd, and was defending himself incessantly. He proclaimed that he was not spreading false rumors, and had really witnessed the two women with his very eyes.

However, the more he justified himself, the less the crowd believed him.

Instead, it was Chu Feng whose gaze grew more and more serious, whose expression became more and more complicated.

Sensing that something was amiss, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, could it be that you know the two ladies that man spoke of?”

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded. His gaze was very complicated. It seemed like he was pondering deeply about something.

“Who are they? Your friends?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

He was also very surprised to hear Chu Feng’s confirmation.

No matter who those two women might be, they would definitely not be ordinary individuals, since they were capable of defeating a Supreme Elder of the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

After all, to be able to become a Supreme Elder of the Wuma Heavenly Clan would not only require significant qualifications, but one must also possess at least an Exalted realm cultivation.

As such, how could Chu Feng possibly know people like them?

“Senior, they are not my friends,” Chu Feng replied.

“They’re not your friends? Then who are they?” Hearing such a response from Chu Feng, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief grew even more curious.

From Chu Feng’s reaction, he was able to tell that he valued those two women deeply.

No, Chu Feng valued them enormously. The reason for that was because it was the first time that he had seen such a reaction from Chu Feng, even after knowing him for so long.

“They are... both my beloveds,” Chu Feng said.

“Beloved?” Hearing Chu Feng’s answer, the astonishment in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s eyes grew stronger and stronger. Soon, his expression shifted. He seemed to have suddenly recalled something. Then, he asked, “Are they the Su Sisters that you met in the Azure Dragon School, Miss Su Rou and Su Mei?”

Hearing those words from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Feng’s expression changed slightly. He was quite surprised to find out that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief actually knew about Su Rou and Su Mei. However, his surprise only lasted for a split second. He did not say anything, and merely nodded his head.

Chu Feng already knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had investigated what he had experienced in the Lower Realms. Thus, it was normal for him to know about Su Rou and Su Mei.

After all, a lot of people knew about what Chu Feng had experienced in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. It was not a difficult task to investigate his history at all. It would be an even easier task for someone like the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Chu Feng, are you certain they are the Su Sisters?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Absolutely certain. The people that man described are none other than the two of them,” Chu Feng replied with an expression of certainty.

“I’ve heard that the Su Sisters were captured by a woman.”

“It would appear that woman is rather remarkable.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief truly knew about Su Ruo and Su Mei. Thus, he felt that it was not Su Rou and Su Mei who had robbed the Wuma Heavenly Clan of their resources.

Instead, it should be the actions of the Moon Immortal.

Su Rou and Su Mei merely had their bodies occupied by the Moon Immortal, and were manipulated by her like puppets.

Although the Moon Immortal was a peak existence in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, her strength was unworthy of mention in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, much less in the Upper Realms.

Yet, she was able to defeat a Supreme Elder of the Wuma Heavenly Clan. This sort of change revealed that the Moon Immortal was very remarkable.

“It must be her. Never would I have expected that she had actually arrived in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm, and used their bodies to do such a dangerous thing,” at that moment, Chu Feng silently clenched his fists whilst anger filled his eyes.

After all, what the Moon Immortal was doing was very dangerous. She was going against the Wuma Heavenly Clan, and placing the lives of Su Rou and Su Mei in danger.

Chu Feng did not care about the Moon Immortal’s life or death.

However, this matter concerned Su Rou and Su Mei’s lives. With this, how could Chu Feng not be furious?

“It would appear that we have come to the Scarlet Province Upper Realm at the perfect timing. Chu Feng, rest assured, I will definitely help you save those two ladies from the Su Family.”

“Merely, it is out of question to search blindly. Thus... we should proceed for the Wuma Heavenly Clan. For her to do that sort of thing in the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s territory, the Wuma Heavenly Clan will definitely not let her get away with it. Thus, they will definitely be trying to track her down with all their might. Should we go to the Wuma Heavenly Clan, we will be able to find some clues,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“In that case, Lord Clan Chief, when should we set off for the Wuma Heavenly Clan?” Chu Feng asked in a deeply concerned manner.

For Chu Feng, as the matter concerned the safety of Su Rou and Su Mei, nothing else could compare to its importance.

Although he had journeyed for the purpose of seeking out the treasure in the mysterious place, he only wanted to find Su Rou and Su Mei At That Moment.

“Look at how anxious you’re acting. Naturally, we will be leaving right now,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled lightly. Then, he looked to Chu Feng with a joking gaze and said, “Boy, I guess you can be considered as having surpassed the previous generation.”

“Eh... Senior, what do you mean by that?” Chu Feng asked with a confused look.

“I’ve heard that the Su Sisters were exceptionally outstanding back in the Azure Dragon School. They were simply akin to goddesses, and there were countless male disciples that were secretly in love with them.”

“However, the two goddesses were actually both obtained by you.. That aspect of yours... surpasses your father,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said with a smile.

“Eh...” Chu Feng felt embarrassed, and did not know how to respond. After pondering for some time, he said, “Coincidence, it was all a coincidence.”
