Chapter 5859: That’s Why I Am Puppeteer Exalted

“Milords, my strength is limited. I need your help,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

He changed his hand seal, and the formation core expanded.

“This...”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders looked at their respective grand elders. They were weakened from channeling the formation earlier, and the fight with the woman in a white dress had left them with injuries. Given how poor their conditions were, they didn’t want to expend any more energy lest it shake their foundation.

“Why are you looking at us? Go over and help!”

However, the six grand elders bellowed at them. The six injured clan leaders had no choice but to enter the formation core. The formation visibly strengthened with their help, and the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect began to turn corporeal, albeit at a slow pace.

“Milords, we need your help too. We only have two hours. This opportunity will slip past our fingers if we can’t manifest it within an hour,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

The six grand elders exchanged looks before stepping into the formation core.

With their help, the formation glowed more brilliant than ever, and the rate at which the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect manifested greatly accelerated.

While channeling the formation, the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master turned to his grand elder and said, “Grand elder, Gongyi... is dead,”

“Don’t worry, I won’t let Gongyi die in vain. I’ll stay here from this day onward. Once that protective formation dissipates, I’ll make sure that everyone in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy is buried together with our Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s clansmen. That includes Chu Feng. I’ll have him see how I kill all of his closest kin with his own eyes,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder said. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The grand elders of the six Ancient Era’s clans had been here from the start, just that they had chosen to spectate from the shadows. Thus, they were aware of what had happened.

“Milords, don’t get distracted. Our time is limited, so we need to focus,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

Channeling this formation was highly strenuous on Heavenly God level cultivators too. In mere moments, the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders became as thin as skeletons. An hour later, the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders collapsed in mid-air, unable to continue anymore. They would die if they pushed themselves any further.

Two hours passed, the six grand elders also became as thin as skeletons, and their life force became extremely weak. Even the few remaining hair strands on their heads fell out.

However, their effort paid off. The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city glowed as brilliantly as a moon. By the time the light faded, the main city had become completely corporeal.

“We succeeded!” Puppeteer Exalted was the first one to run out of the formation core to examine the main city close-up.

The Ancient Era’s clan leaders and grand elders revealed heartened smiles too. Some of them even had tears in their eyes. They had sacrificed far too much for this.

A cold glint flashed across the eyes of the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder. He slowly raised his hand and aimed it at Puppeteer Exalted. A burst of spirit power shot out like a released arrow.

Weng!

However, the burst of spirit power suddenly vanished into thin air before it reached Puppeteer Exalted. It was then that Puppeteer Exalted opened his palm, and the burst of spirit power was sitting in his hand.

This sight shocked the Ancient Era’s clan leaders and grand elders. Even the clan leaders, who were so weak that they had collapsed in the formation core, nervously sat up.

While the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder was weakened from channeling the formation, given his spirit power, he should have been able to easily claim Puppeteer Exalted’s life with that earlier attack.

“Getting rid of me as soon as we pulled it off? How sly.”

Puppeteer Exalted turned around and aimed his palm at the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder. The burst of spirit power shot out at such a tremendous speed that the latter didn’t have time to react before it pierced through his dantian.

“I’ll slaughter you!”

The five grand elders and six clan leaders immediately rose.

“Kneel,” Puppeteer Exalted calmly ordered.

All of them immediately kneeled in place.

Incomparably strong spirit power had bound them in place, forcing them to kneel.

“You!!!”

All of them stared at Puppeteer Exalted in fright. They realized that Puppeteer Exalted had been concealing his strength all this while. In truth, the latter was stronger beyond their imagination.

“My apologies. I can’t coerce you into channeling this formation; you have to do it willingly to draw out its true prowess. That’s why I had no choice but to put on this act with you,” Puppeteer Exalted said with a smile.

“Y-you have been using us right from the start!” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder exclaimed.

“Indeed. I spent a long time investigating a way to activate the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, and I soon found that while the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s protective formation is needed as the formation’s foundation, the powerful bloodlines of your Ancient Era’s clans would be greatly helpful too. I ought to thank all of you. You have been vital to this operation.

“But again, you people aren’t easy to deal with. I spent so many years building close ties with you. I obtained so many items for you. Yet, you still don’t trust me at all. Luckily, you people are greedy enough,” Puppeteer Exalted walked up to them as he spoke.

“You approached us for this from the very start?!”

All in all, of the six Ancient Era’s clans, there were ten Heavenly God level cultivators and two Heavenly Dragon World Spiritists gathered here, but all of them were trembling with anger. They would have never imagined that Puppeteer Exalted had been scheming this right from the start.

It was all for this moment.

“Why else do you think I’m called Puppeteer Exalted?” Puppeteer Exalted raised his right arm and wriggled his five fingers. “You Ancient Era’s clans think that you’re the protagonist of the world, but you’re nothing more than puppets in my hands.”

“YOU BASTARD!!”

The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s grand elder roared, but it spurted a huge mouthful of blood right after. This caused its life force to further weaken.

“Calm down. Why are you so short-tempered? You’re not getting any younger. What if your anger gets the better of you?” Puppeteer Exalted gloated.

“You’re not from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Who are you?” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder asked.

Puppeteer Exalted walked up to the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder and took off his cloak, revealing an old face with unnervingly tiny eyes. He looked like a conniving merchant. However, he had a rather peculiar-looking nose that resembled an ox.

“I was first known as Dugu Lingtian, but my friends now know me as Ox-nosed. But well...”

It was then that Puppeteer Exalted stabbed his hand into the chest of the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder. The latter’s face distorted in pain, as he could feel his origin energies and cultivation being siphoned away.

Puppeteer Exalted looked at him with a smile and said, “You can also call me Chu Feng’s master.”
