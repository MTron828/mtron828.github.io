Chapter 3784 - Play With Them

Sure enough, after Chu Feng asked that question, the several men immediately revealed joyous looks.

Finally, someone had given them an opportunity to show off.

“Brother Asura, it seems that you’re very interested in the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse. Truth be told, someone of your status will not be able to enter the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse in your entire life.”

“That said, you are very fortunate to have encountered us, and our brother Luo Zhi.”

“Brother Luo Zhi’s father is the best friend of the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse’s owner. Whilst others will not be able to enter the teahouse, our brother Luo Zhi is able to enter the teahouse at will. Furthermore, he will be seated at the best seat in the teahouse,” those men said in a very proud manner.

“That amazing?”

Chu Feng revealed a look of admiration as he looked to that man by the name of Luo Zhi.

As for that man by the name of Luo Zhi, he did not even bother to look at Chu Feng. Proudly, he said, “I only bring my close friends to the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse.”

His unspoken implication was that he would not bring Chu Feng to the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse.

“Young master Asura, are you very interested in the show at the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse?” Song Ge asked Chu Feng.

“I am indeed slightly interested. However, this young master Luo Zhi has already stated that he will only bring his close friends into the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse. Since I do not know him, I am evidently unable to enter.”

“Song Ge, it’s better that we find some random little teahouse to enjoy some tea instead," said Chu Feng.

“Sure," Song Ge not only agreed to it immediately, but she even had a look of expectation on her face.

She reacted as if she was very delighted to be able to enjoy tea in a small teahouse with Chu Feng.

Chu Feng did not hesitate. He turned around and began to walk away. Song Ge immediately and eagerly followed him.

Seeing that, Wang Lian immediately tried to persuade Song Ge. However, her attempt was completely ignored.

Wang Lian was very surprised by that. Earlier, Song Ge would hesitate after listening to her persuasions. Why did she decide to completely disregard her now?

She was unable to understand exactly what sort of magical ability Chu Feng possessed to actually attract Song Ge like that.

One must know that she and Song Ge were close friends. She knew Song Ge and the matters regarding her very well.

It was not only outsiders that were eyeing Song Ge; people inside the Void Cleanse Monastery were also eyeing her like wolves.

However, regardless of who they might be, Song Ge would still show them indifference.

In the past, Wang Lian had even wondered if Song Ge didn’t like men.

Song Ge told her that it wasn’t that she didn’t like men, instead, her criterion for a spouse was extremely high. Not only must the man be handsome, but he must also possess a certain amount of strength and imposing will.

At the very least, his cultivation could not be weaker than hers.

Most importantly, Song Ge was someone who believed in romance.

She hoped that the man of her dreams would be able to save her like a hero saving a beauty when she was in danger.

However, how could there be such a perfect thing in this world? How could things all happen according to the vision of a single person?

Thus, Wang Lian felt that Song Ge would never be able to find a man to her liking with her standards.

However, the behavior Song Ge showed towards Chu Feng was extremely abnormal.

Wang Lian was unable to understand why Song Ge was acting like that. After all, Chu Feng seemed to possess, neither a cultivation nor an appearance up to Song Ge’s standards.

Seeing that Song Ge was truly leaving with Chu Feng, Luo Zhi immediately ran before Chu Feng and stopped him.

“Brother Asura, please wait. Since brother Asura is interested in the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse, I think we should go there and enjoy some time.”

Luo Zhi had changed his previously prideful attitude and actually invited Chu Feng to enjoy tea in the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse of his own accord.

“Truly? Is it not going to make things difficult for you?” asked Chu Feng.

“Of course not, of course not. Since brother Asura is Elder Song Ge’s friend, brother Asura will also be my friend. Since we are all friends, how could things be difficult?” Luo Zhi said with a smile. Merely, that smile of his was extremely fake.

“Since that’s the case, let’s go and check out the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse," Chu Feng said to Song Ge.

“Sure.” Song Ge nodded gladly.

Seeing that, the crowd began to rage with anger.

Earlier, they had attempted to persuade Song Ge to go to the teahouse with them for so long, only to be refused by her.

Yet, a single sentence from Chu Feng had actually managed to change her mind. This made them feel very upset and very displeased.

Although displeased, it remained that Song Ge had finally agreed to accompany them. Thus, they also felt joyous.

After all, as long as they reached the teahouse, they would be able to enjoy tea and refreshments. They would also be able to tamper with the tea.

Thinking of that, the men glanced at each other and wicked smiles appeared on their faces.

That said, although they were delighted that Song Ge had decided to go, they were not fond of the fact that Chu Feng was accompanying them too.

“Brother Luo Zhi, are you really planning to bring that guy to the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse?”

“Look at him, country bumpkin and all. If he is to accompany us to the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse, others will ridicule us.”

“We should think of a way to drive him away. If all else fails, let’s threaten him.”

The men began to send voice transmissions to Luo Zhi.

They hoped that they would be able to drive Chu Feng away so that he would not ruin their plans.

“Rest assured, the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse is my territory. Once we reach the teahouse, he will suffer.”

“Isn’t it better that we enjoy some appetizers before we enjoy the main course that is Song Ge?”

Luo Zhi spoke with a very despicable tone.

Hearing those words, the men all realized his intention.

Thus, all of them also revealed looks of anticipation in their eyes.

However, what they didn’t know was that even though they were sending voice transmissions to each other, all their conversations were overheard by Chu Feng.

Chu Feng and the others soon arrived at the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse.

Although it was named a teahouse, it was extremely large. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Merely the lounge could contain hundreds of millions of people. Apart from the lounge, there were over ten thousand private rooms. Each of those private rooms was extremely spacious, and could contain over ten thousand people at once.

Of course, only people with sufficient strength were capable of entering those private rooms. Generally, they would only come in groups of three or four, and never over ten thousand.

The decorations of the Cyan Bamboo Teahouse could be said to be quite stylish too.

The Cyan Bamboo Teahouse used young bamboos as the main source of decoration, and other plants to complement them. There were no paintings in the teahouse, but it still appeared simple and elegant. The inside of the teahouse resembled an indoor forest.

Led by Luo Zhi, Chu Feng and the others were given a private room.

This private room was actually made of world spirit techniques. One could not see anything happening inside the room from the outside. However, one could see the entire lounge from inside the room.

Not long after they were seated, people immediately came with tea.

It must be said that the tea there was the work of a tea master.

Not only was there a large variety of teas, but they were also very fragrant, rich, clear and sweet.

In addition to the ambiance of the place, enjoying tea was truly comfortable.

This was especially true for the lounge. The lounge was different from the private rooms. There were many small tables in the lounge, with many people enjoying tea. Rather than calling the place a teahouse, it would be more accurate to call it an enormous restaurant.

The entire teahouse bustled with noise and excitement. Chu Feng was very fond of such a feeling.

Martial cultivators sought unsurpassed cultivation and unsurpassed status.

For many people, they lived their lives like Immortals. After enjoying their paramount status for many years, they would even forget that they were people.

Although this teahouse was also filled with cultivators, it was filled with liveliness too.

Being there, one would feel like one had returned to one’s most ordinary, most simple form of living.

Chu Feng enjoyed this sort of environment greatly. He drank tea, watched the performance, and chatted with Song Ge leisurely.
