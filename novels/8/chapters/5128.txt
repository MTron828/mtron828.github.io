Chapter 5128: We’re Just Saving Ourselves

There was a spatial distortion in the entrance of the hall.

Two silhouettes materialized out of thin air, one tall and one short. They were dressed in red bamboo hats and robes, looking as if they were dyed in blood. It was not to say that their appearances were terrifying, but it did look awfully repressive.

A formation on their red bamboo hats blurred their appearance and concealed their cultivation. Nevertheless, there was no doubt that they were the ones who had severed the Night Monarch’s arms.

Chu Feng’s heart skipped a beat.

He suddenly remembered Shengguang Baimei telling him about a bunch of powerful but elusive people who specialized in killing beings from the Ancient Era. No one knew where these people came from, such that they were even more enigmatic than the Netherworld Sect.

Who could have thought that they would cross paths here?

“It looks like I have made a mistake. Were you the ones who intruded into my territory?” the Night Monarch looked at the duo and asked.

“You can’t even tell who barged into your territory? It looks like your intelligence has regressed along with your cultivation over the years!” the tall red-robed man spoke in a masculine voice.

“There’s no need for any hostility between us. We don’t even know each other, let alone have any grudges. You’re here for the treasures, right? I’ll compensate you handsomely so as to make your trip worthwhile.”

The Night Monarch regenerated its severed arm and pierced it into its chest. It pulled out a palm-sized rectangular box, which it tossed over to the red-boxed figures with a flick of its hand.

The tall red-robed man caught the box and opened it.

Weng!

Brilliant light and a powerful aura poured out from the box.

Chu Feng narrowed his eyes. He could tell that the box was similar to a Cosmos Sack, possessing a much larger space on the inside than what it showed on the outside. There were many natural oddities inside the box, and every single one of them was extremely precious.

He could sense a dozen weapons with auras surpassing that of Exalted Armaments inside the box. This was the first time that he had sensed such a powerful aura from a weapon, and it stoked his heart’s desire.

As a cultivator who was nearing Half-God level, it was inevitable that he would desire a weapon that could match his strength, just that such weapons weren’t easy to acquire.

There were even more powerful auras inside the box other than the weapons.

Chu Feng couldn’t tell what they were, but those were bound to be powerful treasures. He never thought that the Darknight Sacred River would actually have such formidable treasures, just that these things weren’t fated to be his.

Surprisingly, the tall red-robed man didn’t seem too impressed by the treasures. He merely shot it a glance before closing the box and stuffing it into his Cosmos Sack.

“I’ll accept your compensation, but we aren’t here for this,” the red-robed man said.

“What are you after?” the Night Monarch asked uneasily.

For the first time since their encounter, the Night Monarch revealed a frightened expression. The latter seemed to have noticed that the two red-robed men wouldn’t be as easy to deal with, which was why it assumed a subservient attitude and offered them the treasures right off the bat in hopes of making peace with them.

“We’re after your life,” the tall red-robed man said.

“Why do you want to take my life? There’s no grudge between us. I admit that I have tricked you here with my treasures, but I have already given you everything I have. Your journey isn’t wasted. Do you really have to go that far?” the Night Monarch spoke with an aggrieved voice.

The short red-robed man burst into laughter. His voice revealed his old age.

“Night Monarch, are you trying to stall time to recover your cultivation? Don’t embarrass yourself with that poor act of yours. There’s no way we would give you a chance to turn the tables. I’ll at least offer you the chance to die a dignified death. Will you kill yourself or will you wait for me to claim your life?” the short red-robed man said.

He spoke in a confident tone as if the Night Monarch’s fate was already within his grasp.

“You skunks are really getting too far. I shan’t be humiliated by the likes of you even if I haven’t recovered my cultivation. If I have to die today, I’ll drag the two of you down with me!”

Seeing that there was no room for negotiation, the Night Monarch let out a furious roar. Its aura immediately rose beyond that of a rank five Half-God level cultivator, to the extent where Chu Feng could no longer tell how powerful it was.

Words couldn’t begin to describe just how terrifying the current Night Monarch was to Chu Feng. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Shoosh!

Yet, in a flash of red light, the Night Monarch’s terrifying aura started to wane. By the time Chu Feng and the others realized what was going on, the short red-robed man was already standing behind the Night Monarch.

The difference in the heights between the giant Night Monarch and the short red-robed man was strikingly obvious with the two of them standing next to each other. The short red-robed man whipped out a red saber and plunged it into the Night Monarch’s chest.

“W-who are you?” the Night Monarch asked as blood spurted out from its mouth.

It had already realized that he was doomed to die today, but the thought of dying in the hands of these people left it feeling awfully indignant.

Shoosh!

The short red-robed man didn’t answer the question. He pulled his saber upward and severed the Night Monarch into two halves.

The Night Monarch’s aura dissipated entirely, marking his death.

The short red-robed man took out a gourd, which exerted a suction force that took away the Night Monarch’s carcass, its coffin, and its formation. He stowed away the gourd before heading over to the tall red-robed man’s side.

Then, the two of them turned around to leave the area.

“Wait a moment!” Chu Feng called out.

“Yes?” the tall red-robed man turned around and asked.

“Thank you for saving me,” Chu Feng said with a clasped fist.

He knew that those two could have left him to the lurch and dealt with the Night Monarch after his death, which was why he felt indebted to them.

“You need not thank us. We’re saving ourselves too. We would have been implicated if that foolish Night Monarch really triggered the protective formation in your body,” the tall red-robed man said.
