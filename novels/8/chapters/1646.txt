Chapter 1646 - Scouting For Information

In fact, Chu Feng was feeling very depressed too. He had only been in the Overlord Domain for a short while. Yet, not only did he offend the Beitang Imperial Clan, he had now also offended the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Furthermore, Chu Feng knew very well that, when compared to the Beitang Imperial Clan, the Nangong Imperial Clan hated him even more. Firstly, the secret skill that they had meticulously obtained was taken by him.

Next, there was that Asura Evil Spirit. Chu Feng had seen for himself how powerful that Asura Evil Spirit was. Even if the Nangong Imperial Clan managed to successfully defeat the Asura Evil Spirit, they would likely have suffered enormously in the process. At the very least, the death of Nangong Huayi, a Martial Emperor, was already a major loss for the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Likely, the Nangong Imperial Clan wished to be able to pull Chu Feng’s tendons out, drink his blood, and tear and eat his flesh.

However, Chu Feng did not know that, other than Nangong Huayi, there were two other Martial Emperors who died at the hands of that Asura Evil Spirit. The hatred that the Nangong Imperial Clan had toward him was greater than he could have imagined.

However, regardless of the losses the Nangong Imperial Clan had sustained, it had not been destroyed. As such, Chu Feng felt relieved. At the very least, this meant that not all of the innocents had been killed because of him.

Even though Chu Feng felt a lot more at ease, Chu Feng did not leave right away. Instead, he began to follow a group of people from the Nangong Imperial Clan.

No matter what, that Asura Evil Spirit was his. Chu Feng could not be unconcerned with its death because he had failed to control it.

Thus, Chu Feng wanted to capture a person from the Nangong Imperial Clan so that he could investigate what exactly had happened in the Nangong Imperial Clan that day.

At this moment, Chu Feng had targeted a person from the Nangong Imperial Clan. He was a middle-aged man, and his cultivation was not weak. However, he could not be considered to be a very powerful expert either. He was a normal rank six Martial King with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation.

At this moment, this middle-aged man was walking freely in the city and posting Chu Feng’s wanted posters.

He was very aggressive. He would push and shove people aside and wantonly curse people out.

Taking advantage of the fact that he was someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan, this middle-aged man was extremely arrogant. In fact, there was no one in this city who dared to provoke him.

“Old bastard, get the hell away. Your daddy needs to post the wanted poster here. Your damned stall is in your daddy’s way!”

Suddenly, this Nangong Imperial Clansman kicked an uncle’s stall to pieces. Seeing that, the uncle and the surrounding people all immediately ran away. In a blink of an eye, only this Nangong Imperial Clansman remained on the street.

“A bunch of bumpkins. Look at their useless appearances,” As he looked at those people that were scared witless and fleeing from him, this Nangong Imperial Clansman wiped his nose with his thumb and revealed a vulgar and complacent smile.

“Paa~~~”

Suddenly, a piece of rock came flying from behind. It accurately smashed onto that man’s head.

“Ouch!” This rock was thrown with a lot of strength. It directly knocked the man over. As the Nangong Imperial Clansman rubbed the back of his head, he discovered that his head was not only dripping with blood, the back of his head had also been knocked inward, and the stone was actually stuck within his head.

This caused the man to immediately fly into a violent rage and begin to shout loudly. As someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan, people from the city would generally not dare to even look at him. Yet, at this time, someone had actually dared to attack him. How could he possibly endure this?

Thus, he turned around and began to loudly curse, “Motherfucker! Who the fuck hit your daddy? Are you tired of living? Do you know who I am? I am the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Nangong Dahao!”

“The fuck! The hell is going on?!”

However, he was stunned after he turned around. There was not a single person behind him. Even when he carefully sensed his surroundings, he was unable to sense anyone with a cultivation higher than his in the surrounding area. If their cultivation was weaker than his own, then it would have been impossible for them to hit him to such a state.

“Ouch!”

Right at this moment, the man screamed again. Immediately afterward, he fell to the ground and lost consciousness.

At this moment, a man stood behind him. It was a middle-aged burly man. This man was actually Chu Feng’s disguise.

Chu Feng used a special burlap sack and placed this man inside it. Then, he left the city and arrived at a remote and uninhabited location.

Furthermore, in order to protect himself against the unexpected, he set up a concealment formation and a soundproofing formation. It was only then that he released the man.

“Who dares to hit your daddy here? Have you grown tired of living? Do you know who your daddy is? Your daddy is...” Right after this man woke up, before he even opened his eyes, he had begun to curse loudly.

Chu Feng ignored him completely. “Pow,” a slap landed on his face, knocking him to the ground.

“I ask, you answer. If you dare to speak any superfluous words, I will cripple your cultivation,” Chu Feng said with a cold voice.

“Wuu~~~” This Nangong Imperial Clansman was no fool. When he discovered that Chu Feng possessed the cultivation of a rank nine Martial King and that he was deep in the forest without anyone from the Nangong Imperial Clan nearby, he knew right away that he had been kidnapped. Thus, he immediately shut his mouth and did not dare to curse and threaten anymore.

This man was quite amusing. Even though he did not dare to say anything, he was nodding his head repeatedly. It was as if he were telling Chu Feng ‘I will answer anything you ask so please don’t cripple my cultivation.’

“The Nangong Imperial Clan has been attacked by an Evil Spirit, no?” Chu Feng asked.

“Who are you? How did you know about this?” Hearing Chu Feng’s question, that man was immediately shocked.

“Pow~~~”

Chu Feng did not bother to say anything and immediately slapped him, knocking him to the ground again. Then, he said, “I am the only one asking the questions here. You are only to answer my questions. Do you not understand?”

“I do, I do, I do. Please don’t cripple my cultivation!” The man crawled back up and began to nod repeatedly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Then why are you not answering?” Chu Feng asked.

“We were indeed attacked by an Evil Spirit. I was also present back then. Thus, I saw everything.”

“Speaking of it, this is a long story. I heard that we were holding some sort of Secret Skill Inheritance Assembly. At that time, I was extremely excited. Later on, I ended up finding out that I was not part of it because my talent is too weak.”

“This caused me to be extremely depressed. So depressed, I began to drink. After I finished drinking, I went to sleep. I was sleeping very soundly when heaven and earth started to suddenly tremble, and roars began to be heard repeatedly. This scared the hell out of me. I thought that heaven was going to collapse. Immediately, I got out from my bed and walked outside to see what was happening.”

“Once I saw what was going on, I was so scared that I pissed my pants on the spot. What did you think happened? This was not something as simple as the heavens collapsing. This was much more frightening than the heavens collapsing. A monster capable of hiding the sky and covering the earth appeared in our Nangong Imperial Clan. At that moment, it was destroying everything in its path.”

“That monster was too frightening. Three of our Nangong Imperial Clan’s Lord Martial Emperors died at its hands. As for the casualties of those with cultivations below Martial Emperor, their numbers were too many to count.”

“Even our Lord Clan Chief was no match for it. Afterward, our three Utmost Exalted Elders who had been in closed-door training for five hundred years all came out. Yet, they were still no match for that monster.”

“In the end, it was Lord Nangong Longjian who beat that monster away. I only came to find out after asking about it later that it was actually an Evil Spirit. Furthermore, it seemed to be an Evil Spirit from the Asura Spirit World.”

“Heavens! It was truly too frightening. I truly do not know where that monster came from, but it nearly destroyed our entire Nangong Imperial Clan.”

“Oh, that’s right, you must definitely not tell others of this matter. Even if you are to tell others, you must not tell them that I told you this. Else, they will definitely cripple me.”

“Yoh, that’s strange. Brother, how did you know about this? You don’t seem to be someone from our Nangong Imperial Clan.”

This man was like a string of firecrackers once he opened his mouth. He was unable to stop at all. He was truly a blabbermouth.

From his mouth, Chu Feng came to know what had happened that day. The Asura Evil Spirit had been driven away by Nangong Longjian. It should have been injured. However, it managed to successfully escape the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Even though it had escaped the Nangong Imperial Clan, there had not been any news of an Evil Spirit injuring and killing people. This meant that the Asura Evil Spirit was not as irrational as Chu Feng had imagined it to be. At the very least, it did not go around willfully slaughtering the innocent.

The Nangong Imperial Clan had not been destroyed.

The Asura Evil Spirit also did not go around willfully slaughtering the innocent.

This ending surpassed Chu Feng’s imagination. However, it made Chu Feng extremely happy. After all, this was the ending that he wished to see the most.

Afterward, Chu Feng asked about Aunt Lian, Nangong Ya and the others. After all, it was them who Chu Feng cared the most for in the Nangong Imperial Clan.

“What did you say? Say it again.”

After hearing what this man said, Chu Feng immediately started frowning. His expression took a huge change. The reason for that was because the news he had obtained was not something that he wanted to hear.
