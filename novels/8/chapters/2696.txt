Chapter 2696 - Immortal Armament Villa

“Materials for weaponry refinement, is it? What sort of quality materials do you need?” Song Xi asked.

“I need materials capable of strengthening Incomplete Immortal Armaments,” Chu Feng said.

After the battle with that woman, Chu Feng realized that although his Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler was an Incomplete Immortal Armament, it was not a top quality item.

Thus, Chu Feng needed to strengthen the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler. After strengthening it, the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler would also be able to increase his battle power even more.

Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that the strengthening process would also provide him with martial comprehension.

This would be the best of both worlds.

“Materials capable of strengthening Incomplete Immortal Armaments? That would be hard to obtain. Let me think about it,” Song Xi placed his hand under his chin and started to think.

“Got it! I thought of a place that I think you can try out,” Song Xi suddenly said.

“What sort of place?” Chu Feng asked.

“It is a place that I have only heard of before, and never been to,” Song Xi said.

“Go ahead and tell me exactly what sort of place that is,” Chu Feng said.

“The Immortal Armament Villa. They have been in existence for a very long time. They are one of the most amazing powers specialized in refining Immortal Armaments in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

“Every year, the Immortal Armament Villa will conduct a hunt. This hunt is open to all of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generations.”

“However, there are two conditions. Firstly, one’s age cannot surpass a hundred years old. Those older than that will not be able to participate in the hunt.”

“Secondly, one must be a world spiritist. The reason for that is because one’s martial power will be sealed off in the hunt. The only thing that one can use is spirit power.”

“Those who participate in the hunt will be ranked according to their results. The higher one’s rank, the greater reward one will obtain. I have heard that the rewards are various precious materials. Furthermore, if one is able to obtain first place in the hunt, one will be able to obtain an Incomplete Immortal Armament forged by the Immortal Armament Villa.”

“Judging from the time, this Immortal Armament Villa’s hunt will happen soon. Judging from the distance, if you are to proceed for the Immortal Armament Villa right now, you should be able to get there in time,” Song Xi said.

“I guess this is what they mean by ‘it is better to arrive at the right moment than to arrive early’. This hunt has simply been prepared for me.”

Chu Feng was extremely happy upon finding out about this. To him, this was a great opportunity.

“Chu Feng, so you’re planning to go there?” Song Xi asked.

“Of course. I’ll be leaving right now,” Chu Feng said.

“I have a request. Might it be possible...” At that moment, Song Xi wanted to say something but then hesitated.

Chu Feng was able to see through Song Xi’s intention. Thus, he asked, “You want to accompany me?”

“Hehe. Actually, I have always wanted to experience the world. This time around, it will be a great opportunity. Are you able to bring me with you?” Song Xi asked.

“Of course,” Chu Feng answered straightforwardly.

“In that case, let’s leave right away,” Song Xi was even more impatient than Chu Feng.

After all, Song Xi was fond of traveling the world. He had only returned because of his mother’s illness.

And now, his mother’s poison had been removed. Furthermore, Aunt Jing was taking care of her. Thus, Song Xi was finally able to leave at ease.

Suddenly, Chu Feng said, “Song Xi, there’s actually one thing that I’ve wanted to tell you the entire time. I think that you should bring your mother and leave this place.”

“Why’s that?” Song Xi revealed a confused expression.

“The people of the Zhao Mansion are rather dim-witted. To put it simply, they’re very stupid.”

“I fear that my threat might not be effective.”

“If they were to grow daring and take revenge upon you and your mother, what could you possibly do?” Chu Feng said.

There was nothing in this world that was absolutely impossible. Although the Zhao Mansion was utterly weak and unable to withstand a single blow in Chu Feng’s eyes, he was unable to be certain that they would not seek revenge upon Song Xi and his mother once he left.

After all, Chu Feng had experienced the disaster of having his entire family exterminated by his enemies. Thus, he was extremely careful in this aspect.

However, Chu Feng was unable to eliminate everyone from the Zhao Mansion because of Song Xi. This would not be reasonable. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Furthermore... Chu Feng had found out from Song Xi that the Zhao Mansion’s young master was a disciple of the Great Mountain Monastery.

Thus, even if Chu Feng were to really eliminate the Zhao Mansion, their young master would definitely not spare Song Xi.

Thus, the best way of doing things would be to have Song Xi and his mother leave.

“Chu Feng, truth be told, if I were able to leave, I would’ve done so already.”

“Merely, my mother is completely insistent on not leaving this place. She is determined to spend her last years here. I cannot refuse to respect her wishes,” Song Xi said.

“In that case, you must still prepare against the unexpected.”

“If you do not mind, I can set up a protection formation around your residence,” Chu Feng said.

“That would most definitely be for the best. Merely... I’ll have to trouble you again,” Song Xi said.

“It’s not troubling at all,” Chu Feng smiled.

Although Chu Feng declared that it was not troubling, it took him quite a lot of effort to set up that protection formation.

In order to prevent against the unexpected, Chu Feng set up a very powerful defensive formation. This defensive formation was invisible and formless when not activated. Others would simply not know that it was there.

With this spirit formation, one could only leave Song Xi’s home, and not enter

If one wanted to enter Song Xi’s home, one would need a key.

Without the key, only True Immortal-level experts would be able to destroy the protection formation. If one were to attempt to breach the defensive formation without the cultivation of a True Immortal, one would instead be injured by the grand formation.

“Chu Feng, I truly do not know how to thank you for all this.”

At that moment, Song Xi was tightly holding onto the world spirit key that Chu Feng gave him. The rims of his eyes had turned red again.

“Enough with that. C’mon, let’s go,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

Then, Chu Feng and Song Xi proceeded toward the Immortal Armament Villa.

The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm possessed a lot of martial cultivation experts. Naturally, there were also quite a few powerful world spiritists.

Not to mention Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, there were even many Exalted-cloak World Spiritists here.

Thus, there were many powers established by world spiritists in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Some of those powers specialized in setting up formations. Some specialized in healing injuries and some specialized in concocting medicines.

As for the Immortal Armament Villa, they could be said to be the strongest in terms of weaponry refinement in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Because of that, the Immortal Armament Villa was invited by the Starfall Holy Land to become their honored guest.

That’s right, the Immortal Armament Villa was an honored guest, and not a subsidiary power.

In other words, the Immortal Armament Villa received the protection of the Starfall Holy Land without having to offer tribute.

Such treatment from the Starfall Holy Land also served to illustrate how amazing the Immortal Armament Villa was.

After traveling for some time, Chu Feng and Song Xi finally walked out of an Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation.

Their current location was still some distance from the Immortal Armament Villa. However... it was already filled with people, and bustling with noise and excitement.

Chu Feng was able to sense that there were a lot of True Immortal-level experts among the crowd. There were simply too many people stronger than him.

However, those people were all martial cultivators who had lived for countless years.

As for martial cultivators within a hundred years of age, they were mostly Martial Ancestors. Very few among them were capable of matching Chu Feng’s cultivation and age.

“This is the territory controlled by the Starfall Holy Land?” Sure enough, it’s extraordinary,” Song Xi had a very excited expression on his face.

His excited appearance was like that of a country bumpkin seeing a city for the first time. Everything he saw was novel and new, capable of stirring up his excitement.

“You’ve never been here before?” Chu Feng asked.

Logically, as Song Xi was someone that had traveled extensively, he should have been there before.

“Hehe, truth be told, I have truly not been to the Starfall Holy Land before. This is my first time here.”

“The reason for that is because the Starfall Holy Land’s territory could be said to be the most sacred and respected beside that of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.”

“Thus, I had planned to save the Starfall Holy Land as the last place to visit. Merely... before I could come here, my mother fell ill,” Song Xi said.

“In that case, you’re also unfamiliar with this place?” Chu Feng asked.

“Indeed. However, I’ve made preparations,” Song Xi handed Chu Feng a scroll.

Chu Feng received the scroll and opened it. Upon opening it, he discovered that it was a map. That map contained all the territories controlled by the Starfall Holy Land.
