Chapter 3246 - Seriously Injured Genius

"Are you serious?" Linghu Mingye asked.

"Of course," Chu Feng replied.

"Very well, If you’re truly able to defeat me, Linghu Mingye, with your own strength, then I, Linghu Mingye, won’t need you to punish me, I’ll kneel before you and apologize to you," Linghu Mingye said.

"Very well," Chu Feng nodded.

"Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~"

Suddenly, Linghu Mingye started to move. He aimed his Immortal Armament at Chu Feng. Immediately, a sword ray emerged and began to fly toward Chu Feng with murderous might.

As for Chu Feng, he was prepared for Linghu Mingye’s incoming attack. Immediately, his Divine level Lightning Mark emerged on his forehead. At the same time, his two great secret skills, the Ancient Era’s War Axe and the Ancient Era’s War Sword, also appeared. Like treasures, they began to revolve around Chu Feng.

At that moment, both Chu Feng’s cultivation and battle power increased enormously.

“Boom~~~”

“Boom~~~”

“Boom~~~”

In the blink of an eye, the two men collided. Many explosions were heard as powerful energies wreaked havoc through their surroundings.

That said, this sort of situation did not last for long.

After a short while, the ear-piercing rumbles stopped. The violent energy ripples also began to dissipate.

Linghu Mingye was half-kneeling on the ground.

Although his body appeared to be completely undamaged, his clothes were covered in blood, and his complexion was deathly pale.

Even his breathing became rapid. He was holding his chest with one hand while an expression of pain filled his face.

If one were to look closely, one would notice that his body was actually shivering.

Across from Linghu Mingye, a figure was slowly descending from the sky. It was none other than Chu Feng.

Not only was Chu Feng’s complexion the same as before, but his clothes were also untainted by even a speck of dust. He was a clear-cut contrast from Linghu Mingye across from him.

“Impossible! How could I be defeated?!”

Linghu Mingye had a very intense expression of pain on his face. However, that pain was not caused by his injuries. Instead, it was caused by the unwillingness of his heart.

Linghu Mingye was incapable of accepting the fact that he had been defeated by Chu Feng.

“Linghu Mingye, you’ve lost,” Chu Feng said to Linghu Mingye.

“I was careless. This match doesn’t count. I want another match,” Linghu Mingye looked to Chu Feng and spoke while gnashing his teeth.

Although Linghu Mingye was extremely weak at that moment, his attitude was very firm. He simply refused to admit his defeat.

“Very well. In that case, stand up, and let’s fight again,” Chu Feng said.

“With my current injuries, I’m incapable of fighting. When my injuries are healed, I will come and seek you out again,” Linghu Mingye said.

“Hah...”

Hearing what Linghu Mingye said, Chu Feng laughed. He had realized that Linghu Mingye was someone who did not keep his word.

Not to mention defeating him once, even if Chu Feng were to defeat him ten times or a hundred times, Linghu Mingye would still refuse to admit his defeat.

“Since that’s the case, I have no choice but to do it myself,” as Chu Feng spoke, he clenched his fist. Boundless lightning gathered and formed a lightning whip.

Then, Chu Feng waved his arm, and the lightning whip struck Linghu Mingye’s body.

“Paa~~~” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Zzzzz~~~”

The lightning whip was not only flickering with electric light when it struck Linghu Mingye’s body, but it also left behind a horrible scar.

Not only was Linghu Mingye’s flesh badly mutilated by the whip, but even his bones were shattered. Practically half of his body was shattered by the whip.

Most importantly, after being whipped, Linghu Mingye opened his mouth and began to scream miserably in pain.

Chu Feng’s whip had not only injured Linghu Mingye’s physical body, but it had also injured his soul. That sort of pain was even more unbearable than the pain of the raging flames from Linghu Mingye’s Immortal Armament furnace.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

The very next moment, Chu Feng’s arm began to wave about repeatedly, and the lightning whip began to lash Linghu Mingye’s body repeatedly.

Due to the fact that the power of the whip was growing stronger and stronger, Linghu Mingye was rolling around on the floor and screaming like a dying pig.

“Chu Feng, you’d best remember this! I will absolutely not let you get away with this!”

“I will return the humiliation today with interest!”

Enduring the pain with great difficulty, Linghu Mingye shouted to threaten Chu Feng. After Linghu Mingye finished shouting those words, he disappeared.

Seeing this scene, Chu Feng opened his hand, and the lightning whip started to disappear.

Chu Feng’s gaze was very calm. He did not know where Linghu Mingye had disappeared to. However, he knew that Linghu Mingye must’ve left the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

At that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze toward the location where Linghu Mingye had tortured Chu Qing and the others.

Quietly, he said, “Big brother Chu Qing, big sis Shuangshuang, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu, I’ve avenged you all.”

......

Linghu Upper Realm, the currently most revered Upper Realm in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

One would even have to obtain permission in order to enter the Linghu Upper Realm.

As for the reason why, it was none other than the fact that the Linghu Upper Realm was the Upper Realm ruled by the strongest of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

In fact, the entire Upper Realm had changed their name to the Linghu Upper Realm because of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

The entire Linghu Upper Realm was the territory of the Linghu Heavenly Clan. In there... apart from people invited by the Linghu Heavenly Clan or guests that had come to pay a visit, there were only Linghu Heavenly Clansmen present.

No other power existed in the Linghu Upper Realm. The reason for that was because the Linghu Heavenly Clan did not allow other powers to take root and expand in their their Upper Realm.

Cities belonging to the Linghu Heavenly Clan covered practically every corner of the Linghu Upper Realm.

However, there was only a single capital city. As for that capital city, it was an enormous group of palaces constructed in midair.

This floating city continued nonstop in all directions for many tens of thousands of miles. Not only was the entire city bejeweled with jade and gold, but there were several mountains and vast bodies of water inside the city. This city contained everything in the world.

As the main city of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, not to mention the outsiders, not even the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan were allowed to enter the capital city at will. The only ones that were allowed to enter the capital were elites recognized by the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, a spirit formation gate emerged above the main city. Following that, a figure flew out from it and landed in the capital.

There were countless spirit formations surrounding the main city. The sudden emergence of a person within the capital was immediately detected by its guards. Upon detection, they immediately flew over to the place where that person had landed.

However, when those elite experts of the Linghu Heavenly Clan arrived, their expressions all changed enormously.

The reason for that was because all of them knew the person there.

The person who had appeared was their Linghu Heavenly Clan’s genius, Linghu Mingye.

However, if they had only seen Linghu Mingye, they would not have been so astonished.

The reason for their astonishment was because Linghu Mingye only had half a body. His legs were gone. They had been whipped off by Chu Feng.

Inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, with the power of the grand protective formation, Linghu Mingye would have been able to immediately recover his lost legs.

However, as he had left the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, his injuries were not restored. That was the reason why he appeared with only half of his body intact.

The people of the Linghu Heavenly Clan had no idea who it was that had made Linghu Mingye like that. However, they knew from looking at his bloodied clothes that Linghu Mingye had been tortured by someone.

However, what worried those experts the most was the fact that not only did Linghu Mingye have a twisted expression, but he was still screaming miserably in pain.

His screams were very tragic. Hearing those screams, one would feel a sense of compassion and pity. This was even more so for those senior Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, who treasured Linghu Mingye dearly.

That said, while they were filled with grief and indignation, those Linghu Heavenly Clan’s experts also could not help themselves but to wonder exactly who it was that managed to seriously injure their clan’s genius.
