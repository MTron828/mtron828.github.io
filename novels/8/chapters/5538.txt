Chapter 5538: I Advise You To Think Thrice

Long Chengyu walked back the same road he came from and soon returned to the Totem Dragon Clan’s warship. The first thing he did upon returning was to look for his father.

Soon, he found his father inside a hall together with Long Xu and Long Muxi.

His father had an awfully livid expression, and his killing intent surged in the hall. Long Xu and Long Muxi had heavy expressions that reflected their unease too.

Clearly, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had heard about what they had encountered.

“You’re back?” Long Muxi noticed Long Chengyu and asked.

The first thing she did upon returning was to look for the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, so she didn’t know about the return of the other Totem Dragon Clansmen, who had entered the spirit formation gate leading to the Immemorial Star Sea together with Chu Feng.

“Big sister, the spirit formation gate doesn’t lead us straight to the Immemorial Star Sea but a passageway…” Long Chengyu shared what they had faced after entering the spirit formation gate.

“It looks like young friend Chu Feng wishes to leave his name on the Immemorial Star Sea’s stone monument,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly spoke up. His complexion had alleviated from before, and his tone sounded normal.

He was the patriarch of a powerhouse, after all. The least he could do was to control his emotions no matter what happened.

“Brother Chu Feng said that there’s a reason he needs to enter the Immemorial Star Sea, but he didn’t specify what it is,” Long Chengyu said.

“Young friend Chu Feng sure is a mysterious one. I reckon that even Xianhai Yu’er will struggle to keep her name on the stone monument given her talents. Speaking of which…” The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly paused and let out a sigh. “We have to thank young friend Chu Feng for saving you once again.”

“The debt we owe him just keeps growing larger. If not for him, we’d have all died inside there,” Long Chengyu said.

Even now, he still felt frightened thinking about what a close shave they had. Their fates were already sealed from the moment they entered the realm. They would have all died if Chu Feng hadn’t entered the realm, deciphered the compass, and protected them.

“Chengyu, it’s my fault. I nearly led you to your deaths,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief apologized.

“You mustn’t say that, father… but how do you intend to deal with this matter?”

Long Chengyu didn’t bother asking whether his father knew about the existence of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan beforehand, for he knew that his father would have never allowed them to enter the realm and work with them otherwise.

“I’ll demand an explanation from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. How dare they make a fool of us? They are looking down on us!” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief bellowed.

Shoosh!

A beam of light suddenly shot into the hall. The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief caught the light with his hand, and geographical coordinates flowed into his mind.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had sent him a location.

“He still dares to look for me after what he has done?” The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s eyebrows shot up as his anger flared once more.

“Lord Clan Chief, I’ll come with you,” Long Xu said.

“No need. I’ll suffice,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said before flitting off.

“Lord Long Xu.”

Long Chengyu and Long Muxi looked at Long Xu with worried faces, knowing that neither the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion nor its Mansion Master was easy to deal with.

“Don’t worry. Our clan chief knows what he’s doing,” Long Xu consoled them with a smile.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

…

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief soon arrived in a cloudy area not too far away from the Immemorial Star Sea. There was not a single person to be seen in the vicinity. He was at the location the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had sent him.

But as soon as he took a step forward, he bumped into an invisible barrier. Three figures appeared before his eyes.

One of them was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

The other two were unfamiliar faces, but it wasn’t hard to figure out their identities. One of them was a Totem Phoenix Clansman, whereas the other was a Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman. Both of them were formidable experts.

The Totem Phoenix Clansman had a furious expression despite his best attempt to suppress his anger. In contrast, the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman was relatively composed. Without a doubt, the three of them must have been discussing the assimilation formation prior to his arrival.

The Totem Phoenix Clansman was probably furious because he didn’t know that this was a suicide mission that doomed his clansmen. It was perplexing to see how composed the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman was, but the chances were that he either knew the truth beforehand or that he was unconditionally loyal to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, such that he wouldn’t kick up a fuss even though this matter had caught him by surprise.

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, you sure have many tricks up your sleeves. Were it not for this incident, I would have never known that the Totem Phoenix Clan and the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan are under your protection,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief sneered.

Unfazed by his sarcastic remark, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said, “Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, you arrived just in time. Allow me to introduce you to the Totem Phoenix Clan’s Clan Chief and the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan’s Clan Chief.”

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief waved his hand and bellowed, “I’m not interested to know who they are. All I want to know is why you betrayed my trust and made me send my son and daughter to their deaths. I didn’t hesitate to offer you a helping hand when you requested my help, but I never thought that you would be so vicious as to plot against my descendants!”

His deafening voice shook the concealment formation so much that it looked as if it would shatter at any moment, but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master remained unfazed.

“The two of you should head back first,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said with a wave of his hand.

“Mansion Master, I’ll be taking my leave.” The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan’s Clan Chief respectfully bowed to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master before taking his leave.

The Totem Phoenix Clan turned around and left without saying a word. As infuriated as he was, he dared not to disobey the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

In the blink of an eye, the only ones left in the vicinity were the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I was fooled as well. I didn’t know it was an assimilation formation. Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, you should know what kind of person I am. I wouldn’t have sent anyone into the formation if I had known that it was an assimilation formation, let alone Chengyu and the others,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master explained.

“Heh…” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief sneered. “You’re telling me that you didn’t know? You, who only makes a move when you’re certain of success? The Immemorial Star Sea is a trial for the juniors. How did you even find out about the formation there? You better give me a satisfactory explanation today, or else…”

Before he could finish his words, the face of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master suddenly turned cold. “Or else what?”

Boom!

A surge of intimidating oppressive might rippled from the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, instantaneously tearing about the concealment formation and enveloping the entire Immemorial Star Sea.

Dragon roars resounded in the sky, though the crowd couldn’t tell where it was coming from.

“This oppressive might… Is that the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief?”

The tremendous oppressive might was so powerful and unique that the crowd had no doubt who it was from. Unlike the crowd, who didn’t know better what was going on, the Totem Dragon Clansmen on the warship nervously clenched their fists.

They already knew what was going on, which was why they were worried.

“Father…”

Even Long Chengyu and Long Muxi could hardly conceal their nervousness.

Yet, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, despite being in proximity to such terrifying oppressive might, showed no fear whatsoever. Instead, he burst into laughter.

“Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, are you certain you want to make a move on me? I advise you to think thrice,” said the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master as he stepped forth and lightly patted the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s shoulder.

This light pat caused the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s face to stiffen. A hint of fear flickered across his livid eyes.
