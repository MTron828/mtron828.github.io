Chapter 5958: You Underestimated Me

There were restrictions in the formation realm.

Not only was Chu Feng unable to exert his martial power, but his spirit power was also suppressed until the formation voice faded. In other words, he couldn’t construct formations until the battle officially began.

Jie Tian should have faced the same restrictions too, which meant that the army he had conjured was a formation he had whipped up on a whim. Yet, each of the soldiers looked lifelike, as if they possessed a life of their own.

This was a profound formation, and it shouldn’t have been possible for a world spiritist to construct it on a whim.

“I guess the world spiritists of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion aren’t all for show.”

Chu Feng could tell that Jie Tian was superior to Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao.

The formation Jie Tian had constructed was no ordinary formation; it was most likely from the Heaven Tome.

The Heaven Tome was a secret manual containing the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s strongest formations, said to be able to draw out the limits of a world spiritist.

In truth, Jie Tian was weaker than Chu Feng in terms of sheer spirit power, but he was able to make up for it through his ingenious formations.

However, Chu Feng had another advantage over Jie Tian—his superior control over his spirit power. That was what he had grasped from Qin Jiu’s legacy.

Shoosh!

Despite knowing that Jie Tian’s formation was formidable, Chu Feng didn’t panic.

He got into a horse stance and mimicked the action of pulling a bowstring. A formation bow manifested in his grasp and a three-meter long arrow was nocked in it.

Shoosh!

The arrow was released, but it shook unstably.

“What’s going on? Is it a failure?”

There were many experts in the hall. They were paying attention to the details of Chu Feng’s attack, so they could tell that there was something amiss about the arrow he had released.

Boom!

The formation arrow exploded, but countless more formation arrows emerged from it, forming an arrow rain. The arrow rain fell on the army, slaughtering half of them in an instant.

This was peculiar, as the arrow rain should have been powerful enough to obliterate the army.

Upon closer examination, it turned out that the remaining hundred formation soldiers had morphed from humans into skeleton soldiers, and they looked even more ferocious than before. The formation shields they held were glowing, suggesting that they had been enhanced.

That was the reason they survived Chu Feng’s formation arrow rain.

“I see.”

Chu Feng narrowed his eyes. He was getting increasingly impressed with Jie Tian’s talent as a world spiritist.

He noticed dark strings extending from the hundred soldiers to Jie Tian. These strings were extremely discreet, such that it was unlikely that anyone else would have noticed them.

This was no ordinary formation, and the army charge wasn’t a one-time-off attack either. Rather, it would become stronger over time.

The initial charge of a thousand soldiers wasn’t a complete formation. Even now, the formation was still far from completion. Jie Tian was still strengthening it.

Their shields were the only ones glowing earlier, but by the time they reached Chu Feng, the swords of the hundred soldiers were glowing too, greatly boosting their fighting prowess.

“Interesting.”

However, Chu Feng wasn’t intimidated in the least. He tightened his grip, and a formation sword manifested in his grasp.

However, these formation soldiers weren’t pushovers. Not only were they skilled fighters, but they also knew how to cooperate. Despite Chu Feng’s combat sense, he struggled to defeat them.

It was a draw.

“Incredible. So this is the most talented world spiritist in this generation!” an old True Dragon World Spiritist remarked in awe.

“Master, who’s the formidable one?” a young woman beside him asked out of curiosity.

Despite her youthful appearance, she was much older than Chu Feng and the others. She wasn’t a junior anymore.

However, her spirit power was nowhere on par with Chu Feng and Jie Tian, so she couldn’t discern the details of the battle. Thus, she could only turn to her master to enlighten her.

“They’re both formidable.

“Jie Tian, despite being at Exalted Dragon God-cloak, is displaying prowess comparable to a Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. On top of that, he constructed one of the strongest slaughter formations in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Heaven Tome, Netherworld Army Summoning Formation.

“This Netherworld Army Summoning Formation is not to be underestimated. It is already powerful right from the start, but it has the potential to become much stronger as the formation further develops over time. It starts with the enhancement of the equipment in the early stage, followed by the enhancement of the soldiers in the middle stage, and eventually, the soldiers become capable of forming formations in the late stage. If the formation reaches completion, it can even rival world spiritists of a higher rank!

“There are also three stages to its summoned soldiers. The first stage is human soldiers, followed by ghost soldiers, then demon soldiers. There are no more than a handful of people in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who can summon ghost soldiers. Before this, the only person who has managed to summon ghost soldiers as a junior is Jie Ranqing. I’d have never thought that Jie Tian was capable of it too,” the old man explained.

“What about Chu Feng?” the woman asked.

“Chu Feng’s spirit power is beneath Jie Tian; he’s at Immortal Dragon God-cloak.”

“An Immortal Dragon God-cloak fighting against an Exalted Dragon God-cloak who is comparable to Saint Dragon God-cloak; isn’t Chu Feng doomed to lose then? But if that’s the case, Chu Feng should have lost by now. The battle wouldn’t have been this intense.”

The woman was confused.

“That’s why I said Chu Feng is formidable. His fighting prowess is also comparable to a Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist despite being at Immortal Dragon God-cloak. He rivals world spiritists two ranks stronger than him. In a way, he’s even more incredible than Jie Tian.

“It’s just a pity that his formation is much simpler. Make no mistake, the formation weapons he manifested are indeed formidable, but he’s mainly relying on his prowess as a cultivator in the battle to hold his ground. His combat sense is amazing, but I doubt he knows how powerful the Netherworld Army Summoning Formation is.

“Chu Feng is still able to fight back since the formation is at its initial stage, but Jie Tian is still strengthening the formation. He has probably grasped the method to enhance the formation to its mid stage. Will he still be able to stand his ground then?”

The old man was right.

The soldiers themselves soon began glowing too, greatly boosting their strength and speed.

“These soldiers are getting tougher to deal with. But Jie Tian, do you think I can’t tell that you’re secretly channeling the formation to complete them?” Chu Feng sneered.

Shortly after, his body glowed with the light of a formation too, boosting his strength and speed. Due to that, the enhanced formation soldiers were unable to take down Chu Feng.

“It looks like Chu Feng didn’t sit around and wait for his doom. He was secretly constructing an enhancement formation. He must have seen through Jie Tian’s intention. Exciting! So this is a battle between two prodigious world spiritists!” the True Dragon World Spiritist was impressed.

He was not the only expert around. There were others to decipher the fight for the crowd. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Due to that, even the weaker world spiritists knew how the battle was progressing.

“Chu Feng, I know that you can see through my formation because I permitted you to do so. Now, I’ll be showing you things that you can’t see through. Let’s see if you can deal with them.”

With a roar, Jie Tian’s spirit power gushed forth.

The eyes of the hundred formation soldiers suddenly lit up. Chains whizzed forth from their bodies, interweaving with one another to form a net around Chu Feng.

As soon as the net was formed, a terrifying aura burst forth from the net. Even those in the hall could sense the terrifying aura.

At the same time, the fighting prowess of the hundred formation soldiers hit the peak of rank nine Half-God level. Any further than this, they would achieve heaven-defying battle power of one rank.

“Jie Tian has kept a hand. He has reached the late stage for this Netherworld Summoning Army Formation, but he didn’t reveal it right away to toy with Chu Feng,” the True Dragon World Spiritist exclaimed in excitement.

He didn’t care who won or lost; he was just excited to watch such an exciting show among prodigies.

“Jie Tian is monstrously talented. Not only has he achieved a high mastery of the Heaven Tome’s Netherworld Army Summoning Formation, but he’s also able to complete the formation within a short time. Chu Feng doesn’t stand a chance here.”

Everyone remarked that the odds were against Chu Feng, and such words fanned Jie Tian’s glee.

“Chu Feng, you might be no weakling, but you underestimated me, Jie Tian. It’s over!”

Jie Tian was about to channel the formation to kill Chu Feng when the latter’s voice sounded.

“I didn’t underestimate you.”

Jie Tian’s face darkened. To his shock, the voice had come from behind him.

He immediately tried to dodge, but it was to no avail.

Psh!

There was a sharp pain in his chest, as a formation sword plunged into him.

“You are the one who underestimated me.”

Chu Feng was standing right behind Jie Tian.
