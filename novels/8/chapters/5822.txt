Chapter 5822: The Prodigies Parting Ways

Chapter 5822: The Prodigies Parting Ways

A surge of energy appeared and dragged those who had failed their dao creation into the gate, evicting them from the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation.

“We should leave too.”

Chu Feng had already inspected the area. They wouldn’t be evicted from the area, but there was no benefit in them staying here either. Thus, they made their way out of the Immemorial Land of Dao Creation too.

As soon as they stepped out, the gate closed, and the energy sealing off the area vanished. They were brought out of their concealment. Everything reverted to normal.

“What do you intend to do next?” Chu Feng asked.

Yuwen Yanri and the two prodigies from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion walked up to Chu Feng and bowed. “Chu Feng, I’m thankful for this invaluable fortuitous encounter.”

“You’re being too courteous. This is what you ought to receive. Do you intend to head back now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Mm.” Yuwen Yanri nodded.

Chu Feng formed a hand seal and removed the isolation formation he had placed on Yuwen Yanri and the other two prodigies.

Yuwen Yanri turned to look at Wang Qiang.

“I’ll r-r-return with you,” Wang Qiang said. He walked up to Chu Feng, patted his shoulder, and said, “Brother, I believe you won’t stumble on your current adversity, but make sure to tell me if you ever require help. I’ll rush over even if it means leaving the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion.”

He had spoken those words out loud, which expressed his tremendous support for Chu Feng. The latter knew those weren’t empty words; he would do it.

Following that, Wang Qiang relayed a voice transmission over, but it was discreetly done through Chu Feng’s communication formation. “Don’t worry about the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. I can deal with him. I sense that the Dao Creation Building can help me with that.”

Chu Feng patted Wang Qiang’s shoulder. “Take care of yourself.

“You t-t-take care of yourself too.

With that, Wang Qiang left with Yuwen Yanri and the others.

“Chu Feng, we’ll be heading back to the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion.”

Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao walked up to Chu Feng. They bade their farewell to the crowd before taking their leave. Needless to say, Chu Feng also dispelled their isolation formation.

“Chu Feng, I ought to be leaving now. May fate bring us together, everyone,” Feng Ling said with a sweet voice. She coolly walked away without any hesitation.

“Brother Chu Feng, we might have started on the wrong foot, but this experience has been invaluable to me. It showed me how small I am, and it taught me not to rush into evaluating a person from hearsay. Rumors aren’t reliable,” Qin Xuan said.

He was indirectly complimenting Chu Feng’s personality.

“Are you heading back?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, I’m heading back. It'll be hard to explain it to my sect if I don’t head back now,” Qin Xuan said. He then bowed to the others. “Brother Chengyu, Miss Muxi, Miss Yu’er, Miss Miaomiao, Brother Shaoyu, farewell.”

“Brother Qin, what do you intend to do if you confirm that the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect has indeed done injustice to our Totem Dragon Clan?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I’d concede our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect has done wrong, but even so, I, Qin Xuan, was born as a Heavenly Dome Immortal Sectmember and will die as one. I can’t judge my sect’s wrongdoings from a neutral point of view,” Qin Xuan said.

“I see. It looks like a battle between us is inevitable,” Long Chengyu said.

“Brother Chengyu, I ask you not to hold back if such a day comes,” Qin Xuan said.

“Don’t worry, I won’t go easy on you. Our clan’s grudge weighs heavier than our personal ties,” Long Chengyu said.

“It’s the same for me too. Farewell.” Qin Xuan rose into the sky and flitted off.

“Chu Feng, what do you intend to do?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I wish to return to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,” Chu Feng said.

Despite having obtained the strongest Dao Creation Palace, he didn’t receive any benefit from it. All he had was guidance pointing to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. He anxiously wanted to raise his cultivation, so he decided to make a trip over.

“We shan’t be joining you. You can look for us after you’re done with your affairs,” Long Chengyu said.

“Are you rushing back?” Chu Feng asked.

“To be honest, I have been triggered. I need to work harder to complement my deficiencies,” Long Chengyu said.

“That’s good too.” Chu Feng nodded.

“Take care, Chu Feng,” Long Muxi said.

“I’ll be done. You don’t have to worry about me,” Chu Feng said.

Long Chengyu left with Long Muxi, leaving Chu Feng, Little Fishy, Xianhai Shaoyu, and Xian Miaomiao behind.

“Chu Feng, are you in a rush to return to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“Not really. Brother Shaoyu, do you have something up?” Chu Feng asked.

“Brother Chu Feng, have you heard of the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild?”

“I’ve heard about them.”

“The Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild will be holding an auction in the Immortal Sea Galaxy. There’s an item there I’m interested in, and we should be able to make it in time if we rush back now. I’d like to invite you over with us,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Little Fishy’s eyes lit up. She stared at Chu Feng with expectant eyes, hoping that Chu Feng would agree. She knew that she would have to part ways with Chu Feng if he rejected it.

“I’ll come with you. I’m in no rush to head back,” Chu Feng said.

He was in a rush to head back, but he wouldn’t turn down a request from a brother.

“Great! It won’t be boring now that I have big brother to travel with me,” Little Fishy said.

“What do you mean by that? Is it that boring being with me?” Xianhai Shaoyu growled.

“Being with you makes me want to fall asleep,” Little Fishy snorted. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Chu Feng turned to Xian Miaomiao and asked, “Do you want to come with us?”

He was intending to return to the Eastern Region with Xian Miaomiao. The Immortal Sea Galaxy was near the Totem Dragon Galaxy, so he thought that they could travel together.

“I have heard about the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild. There’d likely be a lot of treasures in the auction. I’d love to tag along, but I have to head back now,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Miaomiao, are you returning by yourself? Or is someone fetching you?” Chu Feng asked.

He was worried about her. They had gotten along well with the other prodigies thus far, but it was unwise to think that they were best buddies just because of that. There was no saying that one of them might leak the fact that she had Soul Fog.

That was a power comparable to Genesis Bloodline. She would be in great danger if the others learned about it.

“Don’t worry. My master is already here to fetch me,” Xian Miaomiao replied.

“That’s great.” Chu Feng’s heart was set at ease.

He knew that Xian Miaomiao’s master, Song Changsheng, was not just his master’s good friend but also an unfathomably powerful individual.

“Chu Feng, let’s hug.” Xian Miaomiao suddenly opened her arms. She was smiling, but her eyes reflected her reluctance to part.
