MGA: Chapter 897 - A Clean Cut

“Whatever, don’t brood over it too much. As they say, you gain a bit of wisdom when you gain a bit of suffering. Just view this as a lesson. However, right now, this place is not safe. We have to quickly return to the Misty Peak,” Qiushui Fuyan urged, but then murmured, “For no reason at all, why have two people from the Holy Land of Martialism appeared? I feel that they’ve come here with some sort of goal... I just hope it won’t affect us.”

Chu Feng couldn’t help recalling the woman called Tantai Xue after Qiushui Fuyan spoke. He suddenly felt such a powerful woman who wasn’t well-known at all very possibly didn’t come from the Eastern Sea Region. She quite likely also came from the Holy Land of Martialism.

However, Chu Feng was not too worried. Instead, a hint of a smile was worn on his face.

Although it was quite possible a huge turmoil in the Eastern Sea Region would arise due to the arrival of the people from the Holy Land of Martialism, their arrival itself proved Chu Feng could reach the Holy Land of Martialism from the Eastern Sea Region via the Heavenly Road, something he was uncertain of before.

Whether that was fortune or misfortune was still an unknown.

Chu Feng followed Qiushui Fuyan and returned to the Misty Peak. Just in case, they went in other less direct paths to avoid meeting people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.

Luckily, there were no more incidents and both of them safely reached the Misty Peak.

After they returned, Lady Piaomiao was still concocting medicine in seclusion, and Qiushui Fuyan, due to the battle, gained new insights. She prepared to cultivate in seclusion to make a breakthrough to rank two Martial King.

This was not her first attempt. Before today, she had tried sixteen times, but had yet to succeed. However, this time, she said she had gained many insights and could likely succeed.

As for Chu Feng, he didn’t leave the Misty Peak. The world outside was really too chaotic. Even people from the Holy Land of Martialism had appeared, and they even seemed to be on the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s side. Right now, the Misty Peak was the only place that guaranteed their safety.

At the same time, Chu Feng had been pondering an issue. You Mingdeng had ordered the Crippling Night Demon Sect to sever their relation with him. How to find Fu Liansheng became a huge problem.

Moreover, Chu Feng, who had seen many acts of deception, no longer dared to be certain whether that Fu Liansheng was truly worthy of trust. If this continued, the hope in saving Qiu Canfeng was really too remote. If he attempted it, not only would it increase the danger to himself, it was likely the ones close to him would be affected as well.

“Chu Feng!” On that day, Chu Feng was still thinking about that question. Zi Ling’s sweet and soft voice then suddenly rang out outside.

“Oh? You’ve come!” Chu Feng flashed a dazzling smile when he opened the door, because not only was Zi Ling in front of him, even Su Rou, Su Mei, Zhang Tianyi, and Jiang Wushang had come.

These were the closest people to Chu Feng, and also the ones he cared about the most.

After entering Chu Feng’s residence, Zi Ling and the others did not quickly sit. They looked at each other, and from their facial expressions and eye contact, Chu Feng could tell they seemed to be forcing one another to do something.

Chu Feng couldn’t help lightly smiling, and said, “Is there something you want to say to me?”

“Yeah! Big Brother Chu Feng, Zi Ling has something she wants to say to you,” Jiang Wushang said as he chuckled.

“That’s right, that’s right! Zi Ling has something she wants to discuss with you,” Zhang Tianyi said, also with a smile.

“You...”

Zi Ling curled her lips at their shameless actions, and couldn’t help but cast her gaze toward Su Rou and Su Mei.

But who’d expect them to just stand and giggle on the spot, not saying anything for Zi Ling. Clearly, those two also wanted Zi Ling to be the one to speak.

“Zi Ling, if all of you have something you want to say, then just go ahead. What worries would you have with me?” Chu Feng could instantly tell that they had something to discuss with him, and it was also something that was difficult to speak of.

“Chu Feng, do you know in a few months, the Heavenly Road to the Holy Land of Martialism will open?” Zi Ling asked, seeing that Chu Feng himself had spoken.

“Oh? The Heavenly Road will open? I truly didn’t know.” Chu Feng felt rather surprised. Ever since coming to the Eastern Sea Region, he’d always had his heart on saving Zi Ling and Qiu Canfeng, so he truly didn’t think much of the Heavenly Road.

“The Heavenly Road opens every year, and right now, there’s no longer any need to remain in the Eastern Sea Region. We’ve come here today because we want you to enter the Heavenly Road with us,” Zi Ling said again.

“Enter the Heavenly Road? You’re preparing to head towards the Holy Land of Martialism this year?” Chu Feng was taken aback. He indeed viewed the Holy Land of Martialism as a goal of his, and the Heavenly Road was also confirmed to be a path he had to walk on because it likely concealed the mystery of his ancestry inside.

However, Chu Feng didn’t think of entering the Heavenly Road so early, because he still had one thing he hadn’t taken care of—he hadn’t saved Qiu Canfeng yet.

“Big Brother Chu Feng, didn’t we say before we would go to the Holy Land of Martialism together? It’s time now,” Jiang Wushang said as well, seeing a bit of hesitation in Chu Feng.

“Junior Chu Feng, there is no benefit in staying in the Eastern Sea Region at this present time. Rather than surviving in this place with fear of danger and ambushes perpetually, why not head to the Holy Land of Martialism and experience the world?” Zhang Tianyi said.

“Yeah! Big Brother Chu Feng, didn’t you and Senior Qiushui already see a person from the Holy Land of Martialism? Although I haven’t personally seen them, I can tell from your descriptions that the people in the Eastern Sea Region are really no match for those from the Holy Land of Martialism.

“We are both of the younger generation. Yet, we’re still in the Heaven realm, while they’re already Martial Kings. From this, it can be seen that the Holy Land of Martialism is the true place for breeding geniuses. We shouldn’t limit our horizons anymore. It’s time to check out that place.” Jiang Wushang’s face was also one of yearning.

“You should know why I have come to the Eastern Sea Region.” Chu Feng’s face expressed his difficult standing.

“Of course we know! However, Junior Chu Feng, that Crippling Night Demon Sect doesn’t care about loyalty, so you truly don’t have to work so hard for them. Just leave them to their own lives,” Zhang Tianyi urged.

“I know Chu Feng is a very logical person. He is certainly also furious that the Crippling Night Demon Sect treated him like this. But, he’s not willing to leave, so he definitely has some sort of trouble we don’t know of. Chu Feng, am I right?” Just at that moment, Zi Ling spoke again. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Feng relievedly nodded his head at her words, then said, “Indeed, I don’t need to care about the Crippling Night Demon Sect anymore due to their treatment. However, I became a disciple to one of the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s Four Protectors, Qiu Canfeng. I promised I would save him, and even though I can sever my relationship with the Crippling Night Demon Sect, I cannot ignore my master, Qiu Canfeng!”

“Does this mean if Qiu Canfeng is saved, you can rid yourself of the Crippling Night Demon Sect?” After Chu Feng spoke, a faint chuckle rang out outside the door.

When they looked over, Chu Feng was instantly taken aback.
