Chapter 4239 - Yu Ting’s Glory

“Yu Ting?”

“Who’s this Yu Ting?”

Seeing the characters ’Yu Ting’ slowly emerge on the flag, the people present were all greatly shocked.

What happened to Chu Feng?

Who was Yu Ting?

Confused, the crowd all turned to look at Yue Yang and Chen Guang.

They wanted to get an answer from the two of them.

“Yu Ting?”

But, it was not only the bystanders that were bewildered. Even Yue Yang and Chen Guang, who had been kicked out of the Ancient Compliance Castle, were completely bewildered.

At least for Chu Feng, they’d gained first-hand experience of his strength.

But who was Yu Ting? They simply had no knowledge of that person at all.

......

Inside the Ancient Compliance Castle.

After the crowd witnessed Chen Guang and Yue Yang’s crushing defeat, no one dared to challenge Chu Feng.

With that, Chu Feng obtained his reward smoothly.

But, after Chu Feng opened the case and saw the so-called reward, the crowd were extremely disappointed.

If Yue Yang and Chen Guang knew what was in the case, they would most likely not have braved such a risk to challenge Chu Feng.

It turned out that the so-called reward was merely an egg-sized gray stone.

That stone appeared very ordinary.

It resembled a simple stone that one could pick up anywhere. It was not even the lowest quality Spirit Stone.

Not to mention those cultivators, even ordinary commoners would not bother to collect a stone like this.

But, as it was a reward from the Ancient Compliance Castle, not one dared to show too much disdain for it.

Because of that, the crowd had thought that the stone might only resemble an ordinary stone on the surface, but was actually some sort of well-concealed treasure.

But, after they carefully examined the stone, they couldn’t see what about it was a treasure at all. When Chu Feng asked Old Man Compliance what use the stone had, the answer that he gave also astonished the crowd.

He told Chu Feng that the secrets of heaven could not be divulged, and that Chu Feng should safekeep the stone properly.

Then, he added that even if it was truly useless, it would still be good for Chu Feng to put it away.

The former sentence made some people look forward to what the stone might be for. But after they heard the latter sentence, their remaining expectations dropped severely.

Even though there were still people that felt the stone to be a well-concealed treasure, the majority of the crowd felt that Chu Feng might’ve obtained something completely useless.

Because of that, the crowd only envied Chu Feng’s talent and strength. As for the reward, very few people envied him obtaining it.

As nobody else had attempted to challenge Chu Feng, Old Man Compliance had removed the invisible barrier blocking the crowd.

The crowd were finally able to have their wishes fulfilled. They either went to the Compliance Mirror or the Talent Steps.

Yu Ting was the first person to step onto the Talent Steps.

At the start, the crowd did not care much about her.

However, Yu Ting had suddenly become the focus of the crowd inside the Ancient Compliance Castle.

Even Old Man Compliance, who was lying on his rocking chair, opened his eyes faintly and used the corners of his eyes to size up Yu Ting.

The reason for that was because Yu Ting had stood on top of the Talent Steps for an entire incense stick’s worth of time.

An incense stick’s worth of time was actually very short.

But, being able to remain on the Talent Steps for an incense stick’s worth of time was an exceptional feat.

The last person to accomplish this feat was Lu Jie.

But, even for Lu Jie, he was completely covered in sweat and panting after that time had passed. Once the time passed, he immediately stepped down from the Talent Steps.

But Yu Ting, although she was also sweating profusely and had a deep frown and a difficult expression on her face, was still standing on the Talent Steps. She still had more energy left...

She was still persisting. The length of time she had been on the Talent Steps had already surpassed Lu Jie’s. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“It’s enough. If you continue to stand on the Talent Steps, you’ll harm yourself.”

“Besides, you’ve already surpassed Lu Jie. Your name has been imprinted onto the flag outside. There’s no need to continue to persist. Go ahead and step down,” said Old Man Compliance.

After he spoke, Yu Ting stopped forcing herself and left the Talent Steps.

After Yu Ting stepped down, she looked completely exhausted.

“Are you alright?” Chu Feng went up to her.

“I’m fine.” Yu Ting revealed a faint smile.

Very rarely did he see Yu Ting smile. But, it must be said that Yu Ting was quite charming when she smiled.

Yu Ting was many times more beautiful with a smile on her face than without.

“Miss Yu Ting, you’re truly a well-concealed expert.”

“I, Yuan Shu, have truly broadened my horizons today.”

Yuan Shu also arrived beside Yu Ting. Compared to how calm Chu Feng was, Yuan Shu’s expression was much more marvelous.

After all, what Yu Ting did earlier had signified that her talent as a world spiritist surpassed Lu Jie’s.

That was something that Yuan Shu had never anticipated.

After seeing how Chu Feng and Yuan Shu were conversing with Yu Ting, the crowd realized that the three of them knew each other.

There was no need to mention who Yuan Shu was. As he was the disciple of Grandmaster Tang Chen, he already had a brilliant reputation.

As for Chu Feng and Yu Ting, their performances had astonished the crowd.

The fact that the three of them knew one another made the crowd realize that Chu Feng and Yu Ting most definitely possessed remarkable origins.

“Sure enough, the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain is a treasured place that no world spiritist wants to miss out on.”

“As the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain is soon to open, these powerful hidden fellows have all come out of seclusion.”

Such exclamations of admiration were heard from many of the people present.

There was no need to doubt how talented Chu Feng and Yu Ting were. They were both existences that surpassed Lu Jie.

Their appearances would definitely not overshadow Lu Jie completely. But, they would at least be able to dim his radiance.

As the saying went, exceptional disciples are produced from famous masters. As such, the crowd were all very curious as to who the teachers of those exceptional disciples were.

That said, since the disciples were present, the crowd all felt that their masters would most definitely be there too.

Because of that, those people of the younger generation were all filled with expectation.

They were looking forward to when they exited the Ancient Compliance Castle.

They were looking forward to when the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain opened.

At that time, Yu Ting and Chu Feng’s masters would show themselves.

What sort of people would they be?

This was something that everyone looked forward to.

“Chu Feng, you should give it a try too,” Yu Ting said with a weak voice.

Although Yu Ting was extremely weak at the moment, Chu Feng was not too worried for her.

Chu Feng knew that the weakness Yu Ting was suffering from had originated from some sort of pressure created by the Talent Steps.

Looking at Yu Ting, Chu Feng believed that she would quickly recover from her state of weakness.

Everything inside the Ancient Compliance Castle was quite humane. They would generally not cause harm to the people that entered this place. Even for challenges, they would stop before causing too much harm to the challengers.

As such, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the Talent Steps.

Upon closer inspection, he discovered that the Talent Steps now had Yu Ting’s name on them.

Chu Feng discovered that Yu Ting was actually very concerned about her talent.

Likely, this was caused by her being deemed as the weakest talent in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

Yu Ting’s performance would be a great boost to her confidence.

That was something that could be seen from the fact that she had smiled earlier.

Chu Feng didn’t wish to destroy the confidence that Yu Ting had established for herself.

Chu Feng hoped that Yu Ting’s glory would remain engraved on the flag, as that would become a great boost to her in the future.

Because of that, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the second step.

“Woosh---”

Suddenly, Chu Feng leaped. He leaped past the first step and stepped onto the second step directly.

“What’s he doing?”

The crowd were all astonished to see this scene. Even Old Man Compliance abruptly sat up straight in his rocking chair.

“Chu Feng, quickly, get down!” Yuan Shu shouted nervously.
