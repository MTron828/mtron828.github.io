Chapter 3757 - The Power Of The Battle God’s Halberd

“Am I seeing things? This aura, it seems to be the aura of Utmost Exalted-level existences?!”

“There’s no mistake. I’m also able to sense it. They are all Utmost Exalted.”

“What are those? They actually all possess Utmost Exalted-level cultivations?”

Seeing the army of Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits half-kneeling before Chu Feng, the crowd felt completely astonished. At the same time, they were unable to contain the fear in their hearts.

Afraid. They would naturally be afraid. After all, those were ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences.

The crowd all knew very well what ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences represented.

“What is it that you’re holding in your hand?” Linghu Zhishi asked as he looked at the silver halberd in Chu Feng’s hand.

The crowd were all able to tell that the ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences were all being controlled by the silver halberd in Chu Feng’s hand.

It was a rare treasure. Should one possess that treasure, it would be equivalent to controlling an army of Utmost Exalted.

Thus, Linghu Zhishi really wanted to know exactly what that treasure was.

Before Chu Feng could answer, Grandmaster Liangqiu answered, “That’s the Battle God’s Halberd.”

“Battle God’s Halberd?!”

Hearing those words, the already astonished crowd all gasped with astonishment.

After all, the Battle God’s Halberd was renowned throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. Everyone knew about it.

It was also precisely because the crowd knew how exceptional an item the Battle God’s Halberd was that they were skeptical that Chu Feng’s halberd was it.

After all, the Battle God’s Halberd was hidden within the Mirror Sea. As for the Mirror Sea, the crowd all knew how dangerous a place it was.

That place was deemed to be one of the most dangerous places in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Could Chu Feng really have obtained such a legendary item?

Seemingly sensing the skepticism of the crowd, Grandmaster Liangqiu repeated himself. “Indeed, that is the Mirror Sea’s Battle God’s Halberd.”

“It’s actually the Battle God’s Halberd!”

After Grandmaster Liangqiu repeated himself, the crowd all opened their mouths wide with shock.

At the same time, the gazes with which they looked at Chu Feng had changed again.

He had simply shocked them too many times in one day.

He had defeated Linghu Hongfei, unleashed a heaven-defying spirit formation, and then revealed the legendary Battle God’s Halberd too.

Chu Feng’s performance had far surpassed the crowd’s expectations. In fact, he had smashed the crowd’s imaginations.

“I truly never would’ve imagined that you actually obtained even the Battle God’s Halberd.”

“However, do you actually think that you’re able to win against me using only those things?”

“Chu Feng, you’re a cultivator yourself. How could you not understand that the disparity between cultivation is not something that numbers can make up for?”

“Today, I will have you, Chu Feng, die with understanding. I will have you witness how your rank one Utmost Exalted are completely useless before me.”

As Linghu Zhishi spoke, his clothes fluttered, and his overwhelming oppressive might started surging towards Chu Feng with a power capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas.

At that moment, he was no longer using his oppressive might to scare Chu Feng. Instead, he had truly used his oppressive might to attack him.

At that moment, the crowd were all able to witness how powerful a rank two Utmost Exalted was.

Even though an army of ten thousand Utmost Exalted was extremely astonishing, those Utmost Exalted guardian spirits appeared very small and weak by comparison.

This was a match with a massive disparity in strength.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, silvery light started to shine brightly, illuminating the surroundings. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As that silvery light filled the surroundings, Linghu Zhishi’s oppressive might was forcibly suppressed.

Seeing that, the first reaction of the crowd was to look at Gu Mingyuan.

After all, she was the only person that they felt to be remotely capable of contending against Linghu Zhishi.

However, when the crowd looked to Gu Mingyuan, they discovered that she had a look of bewilderment on her face. This meant that she was not the one who had blocked Linghu Zhishi’s oppressive might.

Thus, the crowd all turned their gazes to Chu Feng, who stood beside her.

The dazzling silvery light was being emitted from him.

Upon doing so, the crowd were astonished to discover that it was actually Chu Feng who had blocked Linghu Zhishi’s oppressive might.

The current Chu Feng was not only emitting the same sort of silvery light as the Battle God’s Halberd, but even his aura was identical to the Battle God’s Halberd. The current Chu Feng seemed to have fused with the Battle God’s Halberd.

Most importantly, the aura Chu Feng currently emitted was that of a rank two Utmost Exalted!!!

“You still don’t understand the true power of the Battle God’s Halberd.”

“That said, that cannot be blamed on you. After all, one can only sense its true power while holding it,” Chu Feng said to Linghu Zhishi.

What Chu Feng said was the truth. When Chu Feng saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist holding the Battle God’s Halberd back then, he, like the crowd now, only thought the Battle God’s Halberd’s power to be an army of ten thousand Utmost Exalted guardian spirits.

However, after holding the Battle God’s Halberd, Chu Feng discovered that it was much more powerful.

Even though he was only granted the power of a rank two Utmost Exalted by the Battle God’s Halberd at that moment, Chu Feng was able to sense that rank two Utmost Exalted was most definitely not its true power.

It was merely that he could not handle its true power.

It was like the Battle God’s Halberd had said to him before.

Chu Feng had only gained a preliminary acknowledgement from it. Thus, he could not grasp its full power.

That said, even though it was only the cultivation of a rank two Utmost Exalted, it was already sufficient for Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, let us take care of him together.”

As Gu Mingyuan spoke, she planned to take the forbidden medicines she held in her hand to assist Chu Feng.

However, before she could put the forbidden medicines in her mouth, all of the forbidden medicines shattered.

They were all destroyed.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing?”

Seeing that, Gu Mingyuan looked to Chu Feng, who stood beside her.

She knew that it was Chu Feng who had destroyed those forbidden medicines.

Those forbidden medicines were their hope. Now that he had destroyed them, it was equivalent to having ruined their hope.

Because of that, Gu Mingyuan was slightly angry. She was unable to understand why he would do such a thing.

Although Chu Feng was able to tell that Gu Mingyuan was angry, he did not fluster. Instead, he smiled.

“Senior, there’s no need for you to act to take care of him.”

“Please go and rest. Allow me to take care of this clan chief.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Linghu Zhishi. “I’ve told you, I will kill you personally.”

“Heh...” Hearing those words, Linghu Zhishi let out a mocking laugh.

He said, “Even rank two Utmost Exalted differ in strength. Obtaining the power of a rank two Utmost Exalted through the use of a weapon is no different from Gu Mingyuan’s rank two Utmost Exalted power that she obtained from her bloodline power.”

“Chu Feng, since you have such a deathwish, I will let you witness the true power of a rank two Utmost Exalted.”

“Woosh~~~”

Right after Linghu Zhishi finished saying those words, his expression changed enormously.

He was astonished to discover that Chu Feng had disappeared.

When Chu Feng reappeared, he was right in front of Linghu Zhishi.

The Battle God’s Halberd in Chu Feng’s hand streaked across the sky and swept towards him.

“Bang~~~”

The halberd struck. Linghu Zhishi was sent flying.

Everything had happened too quickly. The crowd were simply unable to see the details of what had happened.

After everything was over, the crowd noticed that Chu Feng was standing where Linghu Zhishi stood previously.

As for Linghu Zhishi, he had retreated several tens of thousands of meters away.

Furthermore, a bloody wound was present on his chest.
