MGA: Chapter 1405 - So It’s You

“Bastard! I’ll kill you!”

Zhao Kai uttered a very loud shout in anger. As he spoke, his palm began to move. After that, a Royal Armament appeared in his hand.

Then, holding the Royal Armament, he waved it around and unleashed a golden-bright and dazzling slash through the skies toward Eggy.

That slash was extremely powerful. All that it passed, including even space itself, was sliced in two by it, leaving behind numerous energy ripples in its path.

This was no ordinary slash. Instead, it was a martial skill, a very powerful Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.

“Insignificant talent.”

Eggy snorted coldly at Zhao Kai’s slash strike. After that, her eyes suddenly flashed, and the boundless dark black gaseous around her flames turned into a surging black cloud. With an impressive display of might, that black cloud arrived to meet Zhao Kai’s slash.

“Boom~~~~”

The Earthen Taboo Martial Skill collided with the cloud formed by dark black gaseous flames and let out a world-shaking sound. However, after the sound of the collision faded away, Zhao Kai’s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill, that golden slash, was engulfed by Eggy’s dark black gaseous flames like a rock sinking into the sea without a trace left behind.

However, the most frightening thing was that after Eggy’s dark black gaseous flames devoured Zhao Kai’s strike, its speed grew even faster, and its power grew even more fierce. In fact, a pair of enormous crimson eyes even appeared amidst the surging black flames.

At that moment, the dark black gaseous flames appeared as if they were alive, as if they were a savage dark black creature, as they charged toward Zhao Kai to suppress him.

As for Zhao Kai, he was truly pathetic. Faced with this frightening dark black creature, he was actually powerless to resist.

At this moment, sweat covered his shivering body. There was no longer any trace of the anger that he had previously displayed. Instead, his anger had been completely replaced by fear.

Fear, a fear from the bottom of his heart. It was only when he was truly confronted by the dark black gaseous flames that he knew exactly how frightening they were.

They were so frightening that he was simply unable to resist them. Furthermore, they had caused him to lose the courage to even run away. Like an injured ant facing the enormous hoof of a beast, the only thing that he could do as the hoof came crushing down was wait for his death.

“Woosh~~~~~”

However, right at the moment when Zhao Kai felt that he would undoubtedly die, an old man suddenly appeared in the sky and landed in front of him.

After this old man arrived, he waved his sleeve and raised his hand into a palm. After that, a golden ray shot out explosively from his palm. In an instant, it formed a boundless energy ripple.

It was martial power, Emperor-level martial power from a Half Martial Emperor-level expert.

“Boom~~~~”

The might of that Emperor-level martial power was extremely strong. Following a loud explosion, as the golden ray collided with Eggy’s dark black gaseous flames and created violent ripples in the process, it actually canceled out Eggy’s attack.

However, that old man had only managed to block Eggy’s attack. That was the only thing that he managed to do.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Following that, many other figures landed from the sky. Like guardians, they surrounded Zhao Kai. It was as if they deeply feared that someone would attack Zhao Kai. As for these people, they were naturally all the elders of the World Spiritist Alliance.

“Young lady, this is merely a match to compare notes. I hope that you will stop when victory is determined and not kill again,” The elder who had blocked Eggy’s attack said.

Although he was an elder of the World Spiritist Alliance, he also knew very well what sort of person Chu Feng was. He was most definitely a very exceptional genius in the Cyanwood Mountain, an existence who they cared deeply about.

As they were elders with special statuses, they could not attack Chu Feng as they wished. Thus, they naturally could not attack Chu Feng’s world spirit either.

Else, it was very possible for them to cause a conflict between two colossuses. If they were to do that, it would not be something that they, mere elders, could assume responsibility for.

Thus, although they possessed the strength to subdue Eggy, they could not do anything to her rashly. The only thing that they could do was prevent her from injuring Zhao Kai.

“Humph,” Faced with the blockade created by these elders, Eggy did not say anything. Instead, she snorted coldly and then turned to walk toward Chu Feng.

“This place is the World Spiritist Alliance, not a place where you can behave atrociously as you wish!!!”

However, right at this moment, a boundlessly powerful martial power descended from the sky and began to directly oppress Eggy.

Seeing that, Eggy immediately released her dark black gases flames to block the golden martial power.

However, that martial power was truly too powerful. Even Eggy was unable to stop it. In the end, she could only watch as her dark black gaseous flames were destroyed by that martial power. Then, the martial power engulfed her and sealed her off.

“Eggy!” Seeing this scene, Chu Feng started to panic. He flipped his palm and actually took out his Demon Sealing Sword. At the same time, both his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings were simultaneously released.

After his cultivation increased to rank eight Martial King, Chu Feng unleashed the Mortal Taboo: Illusion Light Technique and arrived beside Eggy. He waved his Demon Sealing Sword to slice apart the golden martial power that had bound Eggy.

“Clank~~~~”

A loud and deafening sound of collision. However, that martial power that had restricted Eggy was not damaged in the slightest. Instead, Chu Feng who held the Royal Armament in his hand was knocked back several meters.

“That martial power actually contains world spirit techniques? That is no ordinary martial power, it’s a special kind of Taboo Martial Skill!”

At this time, Chu Feng’s expression changed. He had realized that the person who had attacked Eggy was no ordinary character. After all, the martial skill that his opponent used was no small matter.

“Buzz~~~~”

In the instant that Chu Feng was stunned, another wave of ferocious martial power appeared behind Chu Feng.

By the time Chu Feng discovered it, it was already too late. Like a cage, that martial power sealed Chu Feng within it.

After Chu Feng was also sealed, the two streams of martial power that had sealed Chu Feng and Eggy actually fused together. In the end, Chu Feng and Eggy were imprisoned together.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After Chu Feng and Eggy were imprisoned together, the martial power that had imprisoned them began to change. Several sharp blades emerged in the walls formed by the martial power. Those blades soon filled the entire wall and began to press toward Chu Feng and Eggy.

“Haaahhh~~~~~~”

Seeing that, Chu Feng and Eggy both unleashed their most powerful abilities to resist the incoming sharp blades.

However, the blades were truly too powerful. Even though they managed to stop them momentarily, they were unable to continue to stop them forever. Both Chu Feng and Eggy started to feel immense pressure.

This would not do if it were to continue. The two of them would be pierced to death by those blades formed with martial power.

“Stop!!!” Seeing that the situation was bad, Sima Ying’s body moved. She arrived beside the martial power prison and shouted loudly into the sky.

Hearing Sima Ying’s shout, that powerful martial power actually trembled slightly. However, it soon resumed its action and began to press its blades toward Chu Feng and Eggy again.

“Stop! If you still refuse to stop, I’ll kill myself.”

In response, a flash of coldness shone through Sima Ying’s eyes. After that, she clenched her first and created a golden dagger with her spirit power. Then, with a ‘putt’ sound, she pierced that dagger into her own body.

“Junior sister Ying’er, have you gone mad?”

Right at this time, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Sima Ying and grabbed onto Sima Ying’s hand that was holding the dagger.

His grabbing caused Sima Ying’s lily-white hands to tremble, and the world spirit dagger in her hand to disappear.

After that dagger disappeared, the man immediately placed his palm at the location where Sima Ying was injured. Gentle spirit power rapidly extended from his palm. In an instant, he healed Sima Ying’s injury.

“So it’s you!!!”

Even though that man’s actions were extremely fast and fluid, Chu Feng was able to clearly see his appearance.

Chu Feng had managed to recognize this man.
