Chapter 4648: Asura God-Demon Stone

Chu Feng noticed that Eggy’s injuries were more severe than he expected.

“This Queen forcefully got out of her closed-door training before completing it. Isn’t it only normal for me to sustain some injuries? It’s nothing much, so you need not look at me like that. I’ll be fine after resting a little,” Eggy said.

Eggy was indeed injured, but it wasn’t the result of fighting with the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit. Rather, it was the result of her forcefully leaving her closed-door training.

In other words, she was already injured before she clashed blows with the world spirit.

“You forcefully got out of your closed-door training? Wait a moment, so you haven’t fully assimilated the Asura God Stone yet?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right, I haven’t finished assimilating Asura God-Demon Stone yet,” Eggy replied.

“Asura God-Demon Stone?”

Noticing the addition of an extra word in the name of the treasure, Chu Feng narrowed his eyes doubtfully.

At the same time, Yu Sha jolted in shock upon hearing those words. It was rare for her to lose her composure in such a manner. From her response, it was apparent that she knew what the Asura God-Demon Stone was.

“What’s the Asura God-Demon Stone? Shouldn’t it just be the Asura God Stone?” Chu Feng asked.

“I made a mistake. It wasn’t the Asura God Stone by the Asura God-Demon Stone. If it was just the Asura God Stone, do you think that I would have to go into closed-door training for so long and waste so much effort just to assimilate it?

“Besides, given the small size of the rock, if it was just an Asura God Stone, I wouldn’t have been able to raise my cultivation by so much,” Eggy replied.

“In other words, the Asura God-Demon Stone is a far more formidable cultivation resource than the Asura God Stone?” Chu Feng asked. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Of course. Asura God-Demon Stone is the highest level cultivation resource in our Asura Spirit World! I honestly never thought that I would stumble upon in your world of cultivation. Someone has cast a layer of concealment on this Asura God-Demon Stone, giving it the appearance of an Asura God Stone. That’s why this Queen wasn’t able to see through it at the start,” Eggy said.

“The highest level cultivation resource, huh? No wonder... But speaking of which, Eggy, why did you forcefully break out of your closed-door training before fully assimilating it?” Chu Feng asked.

“You were in danger. How could I turn a blind eye?” Milady Queen refuted.

After a quick conversation, Chu Feng finally understood what was going on.

The Asura God-Demon Stone had many differences from the Asura God Stone. Other than boasting far greater energy than the Asura God Stone, it also allowed a cultivator to preserve his consciousness while assimilating it.

To put it in other words, while assimilating the Asura God-Demon Stone, Milady Queen was actually able to sense what was going on around her.

As such, she knew everything that Chu Feng went through during this period of time.

That being said, it was just like any cultivation resource, in the sense that she couldn’t just stop assimilating it halfway through. That was also the reason why Milady Queen didn’t stop her cultivation the other times that Chu Feng was in danger.

It was not that she didn’t want to, but she couldn’t do so.

She was only able to break free from the control of the Asura God-Demon Stone this time around and forcefully stop her cultivation due to the powers of the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl.

“Silly lass. I could have handled the situation earlier. There was no need for you to risk such injuries to help me.”

Chu Feng felt deeply guilty about what had happened earlier because this was all started by him.

Had he not used the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl on Milady Queen, she wouldn’t have gotten injured at all.

“This Queen is bored out of her mind after cultivating for too long. This is a rare chance for me to break free from the Asura God-Demon Stone, so it goes without saying that I should grasp onto it. In truth, I only took the chance to come out to play. I only helped you out of goodwill, so you need not think so highly of yourself,” Eggy remarked.

Those words made Chu Feng smile awkwardly, but he was just playing along with Eggy.

He could tell the latter was lying. He knew how much she craved power, so how could she give up such a good opportunity easily? In the end, she was just doing all of this for him.

Tok tok tok.

“Young hero Chu Feng.”

It was then a series of knocks sounded outside. It was from the elders here.

“Alright, you should hurry out and continue your marriage convention. Don’t interrupt my conversation with little sister Yu Sha here.”

Eggy had also noticed that someone was here to look for Chu Feng, so she quickly urged him to leave.

Meanwhile, Yu Sha looked at Eggy with a deep look in her eyes, and after a moment of hesitation, she finally spoke up.

“I don’t know how I should put this... but I believe that I’m older than you,” Yu Sha said.

“I don’t care. I came earlier than you, so I’m older than you. Hurry up and call me big sister Queen,” Eggy put her arms on her hips as she spoke proudly.

“I’ll call you Queen then, and you can just call me Yu Sha.”

Instead of abiding by Eggy’s command, Yu Sha proposed another alternative. She also had quite a strong personality too. Nevertheless, she was still quite polite to Eggy.

“Very well. The two of you should carry on chatting. I’ll know what the two of you are talking about anyway,” Chu Feng chuckled as he returned his consciousness back to his main body.

Returning back to the palace he was resting in, he opened the entrance door and saw numerous elders standing in front of him. They were holding some sort of container in their hands.

It was likely that these containers were filled with something, but Chu Feng was unable to see through it. However, he did recognize one of the things that they were holding.

A massive bathtub.

“Young hero Chu Feng, is it convenient for us to enter?” the elder leading the group asked politely.

“Feel free, elder.”

Chu Feng gestured inward, and the elders swiftly entered the room.

The elder holding the bathtub first placed it down on the ground, and the other elders opened up their containers and began pouring their contents into the bathtub.

This brought a slight frown on Chu Feng’s forehead.

As it turned out, the containers were filled with worms; all sorts of bizarre worms. Every single one of them looked incredibly disgusting, and Chu Feng couldn’t recognize any of them.

But most notably of all, these worms were emanating the aura of the Asura Spirit World.

“These are worms from the Asura Spirit World,” Yu Sha remarked.

Both Yu Sha and Eggy could see what Chu Feng was seeing.

Woosh!

It was then that the elder leading the group opened his container and poured it into the bathtub. Astonishingly, it was a green fluid emanating an awful stench.

It contained the power of corrosion.

Typically speaking, the corrosive prowess of the fluid should have instantaneously killed the worms or assimilated them, but surprisingly, the worms were completely fine after entering the bathtub. On the contrary, they appeared to become even more excited, as if they had just been awoken from their slumber.

“Activate!”

Seeing that the worms were on the verge of climbing out of the bathtub, the elder leading the group quickly set up a formation to seal off the bathtub. Then, he took out a scroll and passed it over to Chu Feng.

“Young hero Chu Feng, there’s an order from Lord Black Demon. He requests you to enter the bathtub and soak yourself for 24 hours. After entering the bathtub, construct this formation on your own body, and it’ll lessen the pain,” the elder leading the group said.

“Lessen the pain? Elder, would this... be painful?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young hero Chu Feng, please be assured that the formation will be able to lessen any pain you’ll face. Furthermore, it’ll be beneficial to your body too. This is a necessary procedure you need to go through in order to participate in the final trial. If young hero Chu Feng decides to forfeit the trial, you may disregard Lord Black Demon’s request.”

Leaving those words behind, the elders left the palace together.

They were considerate enough to close the doors behind them, but instead of heading off, they chose to stand by the entrance of the palace.

“Chu Feng, I don’t think things are looking good for you at the moment,” Eggy said.

“I also think that something is amiss here. Anyone can tell that the things in the bathtub are nothing good,” Chu Feng replied.

“Nothing good? They’re extremely dangerous! Those worms are renowned venomous insects in our Asura Spirit World. As for that green fluid from earlier on, if I’m not mistaken, it’s corpse water made out of boiling the corpses of Asura Spirit World’s world spirits,” Eggy said.

“What? Corpse water?”

Those words brought an awful look to Chu Feng’s face.
