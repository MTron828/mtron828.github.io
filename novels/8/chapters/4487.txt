Chapter 4487: The Terrified Clan Chief

A tight knit formed on Chu Feng’s forehead as he felt a little unnerved by the situation before him.

Even though each of these white bones was shattered into multiple fragments, Chu Feng was still able to piece them together in his head to form a complete picture of their skeletons.

From this, he knew that they weren’t humans but monstrous beasts. These monstrous beasts had physiques that were larger than humans, and their skeletal structure was very different from that of humans too. Most likely, they had an imposing physical appearance.

But this was also the limit of what he could deduce.

There was a unique force within the hidden current that severed Chu Feng’s perception, preventing him from gathering more information about those bones.

If these monstrous beasts had died many years ago, there would be no need for them to get too bothered by this matter. However, if they had died recently, they would really have to think hard just what was the cause of their death, lest they met with the same fate.

Regardless of whether it was a natural disaster or a manmade catastrophe, a force that could decimate so many creatures at once was definitely one to be feared. If the force was still lingering in the area, it might be wiser for them to retreat so as to be safe.

Precisely due to this reason, Chu Feng dared not to enter the hidden current carelessly. So, he turned to Yu Hong and Yu Yin and asked, “Has this place been like this all this while?”

The two of them were from the Yu Heavenly Clan, so they were the ones who knew the best about this place.

“No, it wasn’t like that in the past. There should have been nothing inside the hidden current other than natural energies. We also have no idea where these white bones came from.”

“This won’t do. We need to call Lord Clan Chief here to take a look!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As Yu Hong and Yu Yin spoke, they quickly swam out of the Whitesky Star River to call the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief over.

“Let’s leave this place first too.”

The others were initially intending to remain in the area to take a closer look at the surroundings, but Chu Feng, sensing an ominous premonition from all of this, urged Long Xiaoxiao and the others to leave.

Seeing that those words had come from Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao and the others quickly left the Whitesky Star River too.

The crowd soon met up with the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others and told them what they had encountered within the river. This alarmed them, so they quickly dived into the Whitesky Star River together to take a look.

When they saw the countless ghastly white bones scattered around the area, tight frowns formed on the faces of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others. They were intrigued and baffled by this sight.

On the other hand, however, visible fear had appeared on the face of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Why would it turn out like this? Could the legend really be true?” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief uttered in almost a shocked gasp.

Sensing that something amiss, the faces of the crowd also grew nervous, especially those from the Yu Heavenly Clan. This was the first time they were seeing such a terrified look on the face of their clan chief.

This was more than enough to tell them just how bad the situation was.

“Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, what do you mean by legend?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster asked.

“Let’s all leave this place first.”

It seemed like the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief really suffered a great shock. His face was as pale as a sheet of paper, as if he was terminally ill. As he spoke, he anxiously gestured to those from the Yu Heavenly Clan to urge them to leave the Whitesky Star River.

Needless to say, the rest of the crowd wasn’t so foolish as to remain in the river. They quickly left as well.

Even after getting out of the Whitesky Star River, the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief continued flying for some time, and he only stopped after they were finally far away from the desert.

Drip.

Drip.

Water droplets were falling from the robe of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. But given his level cultivation, the river water wouldn’t even be able to get close to him, let alone drench him.

It was cold sweat. He was so terrified that cold sweat was actually dripping down from his body.

“Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, what’s going on? Didn’t you say that the Whitesky Star River is safe? Why do you look so frightened then?”

“Just what kind of place did you try to bring us to? You owe us an explanation for this!”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and the others questioned the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with livid looks on their faces. They were enraged by how things turned out.

It was obvious to them that the Whitesky Star River was a dangerous place. Had anything happened to them earlier, it would have been the fault of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

He was the one who insisted on bringing everyone over, even guaranteeing them that the area was extremely safe.

“It has been safe for a thousand years. I didn’t think that it would suddenly fall into such a state. I thought that it could have just been a legend, and that it doesn’t really exist. But who could have thought that it would all be true...” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief murmured to himself in shock.

“Elder, what’s going on?” Chu Feng asked.

He wasn’t too critical of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief because he knew the latter had brought them here to cultivate out of goodwill. However, what he witnessed back at the Whitesky Star River and the reaction of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had left him feeling a little uneasy within, so he wanted to know what was going on.

“Since things have already gotten to this point, I won’t hide anything from you anymore.

“In truth, we found the location of the Whitesky Star River through a stone tablet that we uncovered in a remnant. The stone tablet detailed the location of the Whitesky Star River and the unique nature of the hidden current, and the pills that allowed one to enter the hidden current was placed right on top of it.

“But other than those, the stone tablet also carried a warning as well,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Warning?”

Hearing up to this point, the crowd was beginning to understand why the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was so frightened.

“The stone tablet states that in the depths of the Whitesky Star River lives an extremely powerful race from the Ancient Era. It warns that this race possesses exceptional power and is bloodthirsty in nature.

“It says that we can cultivate within the Whitesky Star River, but by no means should we ever disturb that race from the Ancient Era. If we were to spot the race, we are to flee right away if we treasure our lives.

“The appearance of that race from the Ancient Era was inscribed onto the stone tablet too, and it highly resembles the white bones that we saw within the hidden current earlier. It’s very likely that those white bones are the corpses of that race from the Ancient Era.

“I really didn’t think that there would really be such a race from the Ancient Era living at the bottom of the Whitesky Star River. To think that the legend is actually true!” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief uttered.

“Wait a moment. That means that the powerful race from the Ancient Era... has been massacred by someone or something?”

The crowd widened their eyes in astonishment as realization struck them.

Did an even more terrifying existence than the race from the Ancient Era had entered the Whitesky Star River? Or could it be that internal strife had broken out amongst them, resulting in the tragic sight they witnessed earlier?

Many different guesses flashed across the minds of the crowd.
