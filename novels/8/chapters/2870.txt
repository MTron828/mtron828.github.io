Chapter 2870 - Asura World Spiritist

“Elder Tuoba, this kid here is Chu Feng, right?”

“While his martial cultivation is pretty decent, his world spirit techniques are merely average. What use is there in calling someone like him here?”

“With my grandson Asura Zhao Kun entering the Inheritance Cave this time around, I guarantee that you all will surpass the Nine Profound Sect. Inviting someone like him would only serve to waste the quota,” said that Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

If Elder Tuoba was said to be extremely arrogant and condescending, then that Exalted-cloak World Spiritist was even more arrogant and condescending. His words were even more thorny and rude.

Hearing those words, both Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi revealed different levels of displeasure on their faces.

No matter what, Chu Feng was someone invited by them. Yet, Elder Tuoba and that old man actually looked down on Chu Feng so much. This caused them to feel very displeased.

That said, compared to Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi, Chu Feng was extremely composed.

Chu Feng had found out that the Starfall Holy Land had invited over a total of two helpers this time around.

Chu Feng was one of them. As for the other, it should be that green-haired man called Asura Zhao Kun.

Since they were both hired as helpers, there would inevitably be a time for them to showcase their talents. As such, it was meaningless for him to bother with superfluous words now. It would suffice as long as Chu Feng could prove himself to be stronger during the times when such things actually mattered.

Thus, Chu Feng did not say anything. He reacted as if their comments were completely unrelated to him.

That said, while Chu Feng didn’t want to provoke others, it didn’t mean that others would not want to provoke him. That green-haired man by the name of Asura Zhao Kun actually started walking toward Chu Feng.

He seemed to be walking over to greet Chu Feng. However, he actually ended up walking past Chu Feng. He directly walked over to Xia Yun’er. It was as if he were toying with Chu Feng.

“Miss Xia, please rest assured. With me, Asura Zhao Kun here, all of the inheritance sites will definitely belong to the Starfall Holy Land this time around,” Asura Zhao Kun said to Xia Yun’er with full confidence.

Chu Feng was able to tell that Xia Yun’er actually did not like that Asura Zhao Kun.

However, who was Xia Yun’er? She was a poisonous beauty. She naturally would not reveal what she was thinking in her heart.

Thus, even though she was feeling very annoyed by this Asura Zhao Kun, Xia Yun’er still smiled sweetly. She said, “With young master Zhao here, I am naturally at ease. Later on, I will follow behind young master Zhao and not have to fear the Nine Profound Sect bullying me anymore.”

“Rest assured, and just leave things to me. With me, Asura Zhao Kun here, no one will dare to bully you. In fact, no one will be able to bully you.”

Asura Zhao Kun patted his chest as he made his guarantee. Evidently, he did not realize Xia Yun’er’s disgust toward him. He actually even turned around and took a prideful glace at Chu Feng.

His gaze seemed to be saying to Chu Feng, ‘Brat, did you see that? Look how cordial the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter is to me? As for you, you’re being treated with the cold shoulder, you can only stand there like a piece of wood.’

Chu Feng sneered in his heart upon seeing that gaze.

He thought to himself, ‘What’s there to be proud of? I have even seen Xia Yun’er naked. Have you seen her naked before?’

‘If I am to declare that I’ve seen her naked, you will die of envy.’

“Well then, judging from the timing of things, the people from the Nine Profound Sect should arrive soon. Let us go and meet up with them.”

“Xingyi, bring the two of them over with you.”

After Elder Tuoba finished saying those words, a strong light flashed past.

After the light disappeared, Elder Tuoba and Asura Zhao Kun, as well as that Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, had all disappeared.

Only Chu Feng, Elder Xingyi and Xia Yun’er remained.

“What is the meaning of this? He’s not even willing to bring us along?”

“So much for being an Utmost Exalted Elder, he simply has no elegance or grace at all. Isn’t it just because he was slapped twice by my master? If you have the ability, then go and settle the debt with my master. What use is there to vent your anger on me, a disciple?”

Once that Elder Tuoba left, Xia Yun’er immediately started complaining angrily.

The current Xia Yun’er had removed her disguise. She was pouting her mouth angrily. It was quite adorable.

It was as if this was the real her.

Hearing what Xia Yun’er said, Chu Feng realized why that Elder Tuoba would treat someone like Xia Yun’er, someone who could succeed the Starfall Holy Land, with disrespect.

It turned out that it was because he had a conflict with Xia Yun’er’s master.

At that moment, Chu Feng grew curious as to who Xia Yun’er’s master was.

Regardless of who her master might be, Chu Feng felt great admiration toward him.

As for his admiration, it was because of none other than the fact that Xia Yun’er’s master had slapped that insufferably arrogant Elder Tuoba twice.

“Little friend Chu Feng, this is your requested reward. Accept it first.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At that moment, Elder Xingyi finally handed that Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng inspected the contents of the Cosmos Sack and discovered that the quality of the materials were truly excellent.

After inspecting them, Chu Feng put the Cosmos Sack away. Then, he asked, “Exactly who who was that green-haired fellow and that old man?”

“That old man is called Zhao Kuangfengyi. He is one of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s most powerful world spiritists. Even the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master has been defeated by his hands before.”

“Furthermore, he does not belong to any sect or power. He is a rogue cultivator. Thus, all the various powers want to rope him in. This includes our Starfall Holy Land,” Elder Xingyi said.

“No wonder he’s so arrogant and condescending. Turns out he possesses some capability to act like that,” Chu Feng faintly smiled.

“As for that Asura Zhao Kun, he is Zhao Kuangfengyi’s grandson and successor. He is publicly accepted to be the member of the younger generation with the strongest world spirit techniques in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm right now,” Elder Xingyi said.

“If his grandfather is surnamed Zhao, why is he called Asura Zhao Kun?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s because he’s a rarely-seen Asura World Spiritist,” Elder Xingyi said.

When Elder Xingyi mentioned the word ‘Asura,’ he emphasized with his tone. In fact, even his expression changed slightly.

From this, it could be seen that Elder Xingyi placed great importance on the status of an Asura World Spiritist.

“He’s actually an Asura World Spiritist? Chu Feng, he’s the same as you,” Her Lady Queen became a bit excited.

“It would seem that I’ve met my match,” Chu Feng also started to feel excited for some reason.
