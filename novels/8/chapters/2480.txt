Chapter 2480 - Appointment To Fight Chu Feng

At that moment, there were two silhouettes rapidly proceeding toward the Sunset Cloud Valley.

It was an elderly individual and a young individual. The elderly individual was an old man with white hair. He appeared to be close to ten thousand years old. He could be considered a living old monster.

As for the young individual, she was a young woman. Whilst that woman was a member of the younger generation, she was still over fifty years old.

However, her appearance was still that of a youthful and beautiful young woman.

Most importantly, her eyes were even shining with the innocence of a young woman.

Furthermore, her gaze did not seem to be a disguise. Rather, that innocent gaze really did belong to her.

The two of them were not people from the Sunset Cloud Valley. They also did not possess any extraordinary relationship with the Sunset Cloud Valley. The reason why they were rushing toward the Sunset Cloud Valley was because of another person, Chu Feng.

The two of them were both individuals who felt admiration for Chu Feng.

“Master, do you really think that Chu Feng could still be alive?” The woman turned to ask the old man. When mentioning that matter, an expression of worry filled her eyes. She seemed to be afraid that her master would give her a negative answer.

“I was present when Chu Feng fought against the Kong Heavenly Clan.”

“The Chu Feng from that day was simply unparalleled.”

“I have traveled the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for all these years, yet have never seen someone exhibiting that sort of disposition of a ruler like Chu Feng did.”

“The way I see it, it was Chu Feng who spared the Kong Heavenly Clan. Else, the Kong Heavenly Clan would’ve already been exterminated. Say, how could such a powerful Chu Feng possibly die?” The old man asked.

“Then, Chu Feng is really still alive?” At that moment, the woman was overjoyed. She then asked, “Then, master, do you think that Chu Feng will accept the challenge?”

Hearing that question, the old man grew silent.

The reason why he was travelling there was because he had received news several days ago that Chu Luxuan had attacked the Sunset Cloud Valley and captured everyone from the Sunset Cloud Valley to declare war against Chu Feng.

If Chu Feng cared about the safety of the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley, he would go and accept Chu Luxuan’s challenge at the Sunset Cloud Valley.

If Chu Feng were to win, Chu Luxuan would no longer make things difficult for Chu Feng, and would also release everyone from the Sunset Cloud Valley.

If Chu Feng was to be defeated, Chu Luxuan would also not make things difficult for Chu Feng. He would only present a single choice for Chu Feng to take.

A choice between life and death...

Chu Feng could choose to live or die.

If he chose to die, then he had to kill himself. If he chose to live, then Chu Feng had to personally kill everyone from the Sunset Cloud Valley.

“Chu Feng is a loyal and true individual. I believe that once the news of what has happened reaches him, he will definitely come.”

“Merely, this Chu Luxuan could simply challenge Chu Feng openly. Yet, he instead decided to use the Sunset Cloud Valley to threaten Chu Feng.”

“Furthermore, he even spread the news that if Chu Feng were to lose to him, he could choose whether to live or die. From this, it can be seen that this Chu Luxuan’s character is quite low,” The old man said.

“That’s right. If Chu Feng were to really be defeated and chose to die, then everything would be over. However, if he chose to personally kill everyone from the Sunset Cloud Valley, his reputation will be swept away. Compared to death, that is simply even more painful.”

“That said, master, between Chu Feng and Chu Luxuan, who do you think to be even more powerful? That Chu Luxuan is, after all, a genius from the Chu Heavenly Clan. No one knows exactly how powerful he is,” The woman said.

“Regardless of how powerful Chu Luxuan might be, could he possibly take care on the entire Kong Heavenly Clan by himself?” The old man asked with a smile.

“I don’t think Chu Luxuan can accomplish that,” The woman also smiled sweetly.

“There we go then. If Chu Feng is to really come, you will know how powerful Chu Feng is.”

“He will definitely not disappoint you,” As the old man said those words, anticipation appeared in his eyes.

“I am also very much looking forward to it,” The woman smiled even sweeter. However, her gaze suddenly shifted. She pointed to the distance and said, “Master, look! That’s Senior Song and Senior Lin. Their disciples are also with them. Everyone has come.”

“Chu Luxuan had already spread the news before he even attacked the Sunset Cloud Valley. They’re all located quite close to the Sunset Cloud Valley. Thus, they most probably rushed over the moment they received the news. Merely, we’ve all come for Chu Feng, and not for that Chu Luxuan,” The old man smiled faintly. As he spoke, he turned to wave at the several people in the distance.

“Merely, is Chu Luxuan really capable of taking down the Sunset Cloud Valley?” The woman was a bit skeptical.

“Look at that,” The old man pointed ahead.

“Heavens, that is?!!!” Following the location of the old man’s finger, the woman revealed an astonished expression.

The direction where he pointed to was naturally that of the Sunset Cloud Valley. At that moment, there was an enormous spirit formation cage spinning around directly above the Sunset Cloud Valley.

That spirit formation cage was humongous, and emitting a bright glimmer. It was even more eye-catching than the Sunset Cloud Valley itself.

Upon approaching, one could see that the spirit formation cage was packed full with people. They were actually all the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley.

It was obvious whether or not Chu Luxuan managed to take down the Sunset Cloud Valley.

As the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had declared, the Sunset Cloud Valley had been attacked and breached by Chu Luxuan several days ago.

However, the Sunset Cloud Valley was not met with the same sort of devastation as the Three Stars Hall. On the contrary, not a single person from the Sunset Cloud Valley had died.

Chu Luxuan had only occupied the Sunset Cloud Valley and held everyone there captive. However, he did not actually kill anyone.

The reason he did so, was for the sake of a single individual, Chu Feng. He was going to use the Sunset Cloud Valley to threaten Chu Feng and force him to come accept his challenge.

At that moment. In a certain mountain peak of the Sunset Cloud Valley stood several figures.

Among them were the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother, the World Spiritist Saintess.

Apart from the World Spiritist Saintess, the several other figures standing beside her were also renowned individuals in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

In fact, their cultivations were even stronger than that of the World Spiritist Saintess; they were all peak Martial Ancestors.

However, those renowned individuals were all standing behind a young man. From their gazes and appearance, one could tell that they possessed obvious reverence for that young man.

As for that young man, he possessed a handsome appearance. However, below his sharp eyebrows, his eyes contained the look of someone who considered themselves to be unsurpassed in the entire world.

He was Chu Luyang’s younger brother, a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Luxuan.

“Judging from the time, the Ying Heavenly Clan should’ve succeeded in their task by now. With the nature of the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the Three Stars Hall has likely been completely eradicated from our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” The World Spiritist Saintess said.

“The reason why I decided to take in the Ying Heavenly Clan is precisely because of the hatred the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief held toward the Three Stars Hall. If he is to slaughter everyone, while I am to not kill a single person, this will better show how benevolent and righteous I am,” Chu Luxuan said.

“Young Master Chu is truly wise. This old man feels utter admiration,” An old man clasped his fist and spoke flattering words.

“In addition to being wise, Young Master Chu also possesses extraordinary rallying power. It has only been such a short period of time. Yet, so many people have managed to rush over here.”

“If the news of Young Master Chu seizing control of the Sunset Cloud Valley to issue a challenge to Chu Feng is to spread throughout the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, I wonder how many more grand characters will rush over,” Another old man started to flatter Chu Luxuan.

“I am, after all, from the Upper Realms. Furthermore, I am a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan. They are all extremely curious to how strong I am. Now that I am willing to display my strength, they will naturally rush over here,” Chu Luxuan said in a very proud manner.

“Merely, didn’t that Chu Feng die two years ago? Young Master Chu, do you really think he’s still alive?” Someone asked.

“So what if he’s dead, so what if he’s alive? If he is dead, I can say that he’s still alive and did not dare to come and accept my challenge, that he deliberately hid himself. With that, I can label him a coward who does not dare to accept a challenge,” Chu Luxuan said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Young Master Chu, if that Chu Feng is still alive and receives news of this, will he really come?” The World Spiritist Saintess asked.

“If he is truly still alive and dares to show up, I will make him die by my hands. I will have everyone witness the strength that I, Chu Luxuan, possess.”

“I will have everyone in your Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm realize that a genius from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is simply incomparable to a genius of our Chu Heavenly Clan,” When mentioning this matter, Chu Luxuan’s face was filled with absolute confidence.
