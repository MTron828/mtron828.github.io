Chapter 1911 - Forbidden Inverse Scale Triggered

“Exactly what happened?” As Chu Feng consoled Jiang Wushang, he raised his head and asked that Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder.

At this moment, Chu Feng’s gaze was slightly sharp and filled with coldness. It was like a sharp blade that flickered with cold light.

The reason why Chu Feng was looking at that Utmost Exalted Elder that fiercely was not because he felt that Jiang Wushang’s current state was related to that Utmost Exalted Elder.

Rather, it was because that Utmost Exalted Elder had tried to kill him before. Even though they had reconciled, Chu Feng still had an extremely bad impression of him. Especially now, when his mood was extremely bad, his attitude would naturally be bad too.

“Little friend Chu Feng, please don’t look at me like that. I really don’t know what happened. This little friend Jiang Wushang ran to our Nangong Imperial Clan and said that he wished to find you.”

“But, I didn’t know where you were. Thus, I could only bring him to find Longjian, as I thought that Longjian would know where you were.”

“However, Longjian has many different places that he uses to undergo closed-door training. I sought him in many places before finally managing to find him in this place. Never would I have expected for you to also be here. This has saved me a lot of trouble.”

“Merely... as for exactly what has happened, little friend Jiang Wushang was unwilling to say. Thus... I... I also do not know what has happened.”

“Thus, you... you should instead ask little friend Jiang Wushang.”

Seeing the ominous glint that Chu Feng was revealing, that Utmost Exalted Elder’s body trembled from fear.

He who had been high and above back then was now extremely frightened by Chu Feng. Even his speaking became timid and filled with stuttering.

“Big brother Chu Feng, this senior really doesn’t know anything. You don’t have to ask him anymore. I’ll tell you what happened,” Jiang Wushang wiped away the tears across his face. Then, he began to narrate to Chu Feng what had happened.

Even though he was extremely sad, he knew that it was not the time to act timid and weak. He had to continue being strong.

After hearing Jiang Wushang’s story, Chu Feng and the others came to know what had happened.

It turned out that after the battle against the Four Great Imperial Clans at the Ximen Imperial Clan, due to the fact that Duan Jidao had been seriously injured, he, alongside Yin Gongfu, Jiang Wushang and the others from the World’s Hidden Valley, proceeded to return to the World’s Hidden Valley first.

However, before they managed to return to the World’s Hidden Valley, they were ambushed by people from the Dark Hall. Duan Jidao and Yin Gongfu were captured. The others from the World’s Hidden Valley were all killed. Only Jiang Wushang managed to escape.

Upon thinking about it, it was very possible that they had deliberately allowed Jiang Wushang to escape. Else, with Jiang Wushang’s cultivation, how could he possibly be able to escape?

At that time, Jiang Wushang had been thrown into a confused state of mind. The only thing in his mind was finding Chu Feng. The reason for that was because he didn’t know who else other than Chu Feng that could help him.

Furthermore, as he had seen the Nangong Imperial Clan attempting to invite Chu Feng to be their guest, he knew that Nangong Longjian was also someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan and had been together with Chu Feng when they had left, he felt that it was very possible for Chu Feng to be in the Nangong Imperial Clan. Feeling helpless, he ran to the Nangong Imperial Clan to look for help.

Actually, he had also thought that it might be a disastrous action to go to the Nangong Imperial Clan. After all, the battle had just ended. If he were to go to the Nangong Imperial Clan, it was very possible that he would be throwing his life away.

However, at that time, he had been unable to think of anything else other than finding Chu Feng, and he had thus disregarded his own life.

Fortunately, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan had been true in their desire to reconcile with Chu Feng. Thus, after Jiang Wushang arrived, not only did they not make things difficult for him. They had even dispatched an Utmost Exalted Elder to personally help Jiang Wushang search for Chu Feng.

“Elder, thank you very much for bringing Wushang here. I apologize for my vile attitude toward you earlier,” Chu Feng bowed to that Utmost Exalted Elder.

Chu Feng was a reasonable person. He was able to distinguish between gratitude and grudges. Although there were grudges between him and this Utmost Exalted Elder, he had also shown gratitude to him by bringing Wushang here. With both gratitude and grudges, they could cancel each other out. As Chu Feng’s attitude earlier was extremely bad, it was only natural that he apologize.

Although Chu Feng’s action might not be much, it was completely seen by the Compass Immortal. To be able to distinguish between gratitude and grudges was a quality of a man of character.

“My, little friend Chu Feng, you are truly being too courteous here. Although there were grudges between us in the past, they are already things of the past. Right now, we are a family.”

As for that Utmost Exalted Elder, he was smiling very politely. The reason for that was because he was truly afraid of Chu Feng.

This was especially true upon thinking about how Chu Feng was only a peak Half Martial Emperor in the battle, but had become a rank one Martial Emperor now. The astonishing speed with which Chu Feng reached breakthroughs caused him to feel endless fear.

At that moment, he was truly rejoicing that Nangong Longjian had shown up on that day and demanded that they reconcile with Chu Feng. Else, Chu Feng would truly be no end of trouble for them.

“Little brother Wushang, senior Duan Jidao and senior Yin Gongfu were only captured. This does not mean that they have died. I think that the people of the Dark Hall captured them with something in mind. They should be fine for the time being. If anything, they might have done so to demand for them to join the Dark Hall.”

“Both senior Duan Jidao and senior Yin Gongfu are smart individuals. I believe they will know ways to delay,” Chu Feng consoled Jiang Wushang. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Really?” Jiang Wushang’s expression changed. His expression that was filled with self blame eased a bit.

“Trust me, they should be fine,” Chu Feng said with a smile. Then, Bai Suyan personally prepared a location for Jiang Wushang to rest.

Although Jiang Wushang was not physically injured, the injury to his heart and mind was very serious. To look on helplessly as the people beside him were killed and captured was a very painful thing. He really did need to have a proper rest.

“This Dark Hall...” After Jiang Wushang left, Chu Feng’s expression immediately changed. His eyes that were originally calm were now filled with frost. He looked extremely frightening.

“Chu Feng, what’s wrong?” Bai Ruochen was frightened by Chu Feng’s expression.

“If the Dark Hall wanted to, even if little brother Wushang wasn’t killed, he would not be able to escape from here.”

“His escape meant that the Dark Hall must’ve deliberately allowed him to escape. This is a provocation, the Dark Hall’s provocation toward me, Chu Feng,” Chu Feng clenched his fists tightly and spoke through clenched teeth.

“What do you plan to do then?” Bai Ruochen asked.

“I can endure anything that they throw at me. However, I absolutely will not allow them to harm those close to me. Regardless of whether the two seniors are safe or not, I will still make the Dark Hall pay in blood,” As Chu Feng said those words, he began to radiate killing intent. His killing intent caused the surrounding region’s air to became ice-cold. It was as if even the sky was going to be frozen.

Seeing Chu Feng acting like this, Bai Ruochen’s body started to tremble slightly. Although she approved of the way Chu Feng handled things, she had to admit that the Chu Feng before her was somewhat frightening. He had been truly enraged.

Dragons possessed forbidden inverse scales. As for Chu Feng’s forbidden inverse scale, it had been triggered by the Dark Hall.

That said, although the current situation wasn’t good, although Chu Feng was extremely enraged, Duan Jidao and Yin Gongfu were not that easily capable of being saved.

Firstly, Chu Feng did not possess sufficient strength. Next, even if he did possess sufficient strength, he didn’t know where the headquarters of the Dark Hall was. Thus, even if he wanted to save them, he wouldn’t know where to go.

Thus, Chu Feng could only work on what he had to finish right now. That was, to wholeheartedly finish perfecting the Blood Devouring Armors, and then wholeheartedly control the spirit formation to help treat Nangong Longjian’s illness.

All of this was observed by the Compass Immortal. He had also known all about what happened with Jiang Wushang and the others.

Although Chu Feng became extremely emotional from anger, he was able to adjust himself in the blink of an eye. This caused the Compass Immortal to feel deep admiration for Chu Feng, for it was something that even he did not think he would be able to accomplish.

With the effort from Chu Feng, Nangong Longjian’s illness was finally treated. They had succeeded.

At that moment, everyone was overjoyed. This was especially true for Bai Ruochen and her mother Bai Suyan. They were crying in joy, and so excited that they didn’t know what to do.

As for Chu Feng, he was also very happy. Merely, while being happy, a trace of worry was contained within his eyes.
