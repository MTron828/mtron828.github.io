Chapter 4042 - Bullying Using One’s Position?

“Are you the one trying to touch my clan chief?”

After sweeping his gaze across the crowd, Chu Feng’s ice-cold gaze landed on Wuming Fenghong.

Faced with Chu Feng’s gaze, the arrogant and aloof Wuming Fenghong’s expression actually turned ugly.

It would be a lie to say that he was not afraid of Chu Feng.

However, he was one of the Wuming Clan’s Six Great Utmost Exalteds. As such, he had his own honor that he had to uphold.

Even though he had heard the various rumors about Chu Feng and felt some apprehension toward him, he could not express it.

As such, his attitude remained unyielding.

Mockingly, Wuming Fenghong said to Chu Feng, “You’re but a mere person of the younger generation, what makes you so arrogant?”

“In the end, you’re simply relying on the support of the Three Cities.”

Hearing those words, not only was Chu Feng not enraged, he instead revealed a faint smile. “So what if I’m relying on the Three Cities? At least I have people I can rely on.”

“Unlike certain people who were beaten to the point of fleeing with their tails between their legs in defeat by the Linghu Heavenly Clan; afraid to even continue to stay in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Now that the Linghu Heavenly Clan has been beaten back, they’ve decided to come back and flashing their strength claiming that they intend to be the overlords of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“I’d urge you all to look at yourselves with a mirror and recall your appearances when you were scared away by the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Then, ask yourselves this: are you qualified to be the overlord?”

“You!”

Not to mention Wuming Fenghong, many other Wuming Clansmen had turned red with anger.

Chu Feng’s words had firmly stabbed them in their sore spot.

They looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clan because the Chu Heavenly Clan was too weak. That... was an undeniable truth.

However, the Wuming Clan, previously the overlord’s of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, had fled in defeat after being beaten by the Linghu Heavenly Clan. That was also an undeniable truth.

In comparison, the actions of the Wuming Clan were also extremely humiliating.

“Chu Feng, you should know that a loose tongue can cause a lot of trouble.”

“Don’t think that this old man does not dare to touch you just because you’re backed by the Three Cities.”

Wuming Fenghong’s gaze had grown increasingly cold.

He was thoroughly enraged by Chu Feng.

“You can give it a try.”

However, faced with Wuming Fenghong’s threat, Chu Feng not only showed no fear, but he instead had a look of contempt in his eyes. He was looking at Wuming Fenghong as if he was looking at a clown.

Killing intent was hidden in Chu Feng’s mocking smile.

Chu Feng was actually also enraged. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He had just returned home. Originally, he had thought that the Chu Heavenly Clan would be very peaceful, as they were supported by the Three Cities.

Never did he imagine that, before he could even enter his home, he would encounter the Wuming Clan’s expedition against his Chu Heavenly Clan.

It was one thing if they were talking peacefully.

However, they weren’t. Furthemore, the Wuming Clan intended to kill his Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

They were not merely making a threat. They really intended to do so.

In other words, if Chu Feng had been a moment late in his arrival, his Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would’ve died at Wuming Fenghong’s hands.

Because of that, anger was already surging in Chu Feng’s heart.

He thought in his heart, ‘You failed to take on the Linghu Heavenly Clan and fled in defeat.’

‘Now that the Linghu Heavenly Clan has been driven away by my Chu Heavenly Clan, you’ve returned to bully my Chu Heavenly Clan?’

‘This is simply bullying someone in their home.’

If it wasn’t for the fact that there were some familiar faces among the Wuming Clansmen, Chu Feng would’ve attacked them already.

He was giving his friends from the Wuming Clan face by not attacking them directly.

However, if Wuming Fenghong failed to recognize what was good for him and dared to attack him, then Chu Feng would definitely let him know what was meant by ‘too late to regret.’

“Did you think this old man wouldn’t dare?!”

Wuming Fenghong was a person with a fiery temper. Enraged by Chu Feng’s behavior, he had decided to disregard all consequences.

As he spoke, he released his oppressive might with the intention to attack Chu Feng.

“Elder Fenghong, you must not do that.”

However, right at that moment, two old men arrived before Wuming Fenghong and forcibly suppressed his oppressive might.

Those two were also rank one Utmost Exalteds.

They were both members of the Wuming Clan’s Six Great Utmost Exalteds.

They had status and power on par with Wuming Fenghong.

When Wuming Fenghong intended to kill the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief earlier, neither of them had attempted to stop him.

However, at that moment they had actually stopped him from attacking Chu Feng.

From this, one could tell just how much the Wuming Clan was afraid of Chu Feng.

Whilst they could disregard the Chu Heavenly Clan, they could not do the same for Chu Feng.

They knew very well how powerful the Ancestral Martial Dragon City was.

If they really touched Chu Feng and ended up angering them, they would not be able to handle the consequences.

After all, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City was a power that dared to touch even the All-heaven Sect’s Supreme Elder.

“You all, are we supposed to allow this person of the younger generation to continue to behave so atrociously towards our Wuming Clan?”

“Since when has our Wuming Clan fallen to such a state where we have to tolerate this sort of thing?”

Wuming Fenghong gnashed his teeth furiously.

He felt that if they were scared by the Chu Heavenly Clan, it would be an enormous insult to them.

“Let us wait a while. Lord Clan Chief should be able to handle this matter.”

“After all, if their Chu Heavenly Clan is to go to the appointment, they will be disgracing our entire Ancestral Martial Starfield,” said one of the two Six Great Utmost Exalteds.

Hearing those words, Wuming Fenghong’s expression changed.

He suddenly recalled that their Wuming Clan also had a trump card.

This trump card was their Lord Clan Chief, the Starfield Master Realm’s master, Wuming Doutian.

Although Wuming Doutian behaved in a very tyrannical manner when dealing with the powers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he knew very well that the strongest power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield was not their Wuming Clan, but rather the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

As such, he had maintained a good relationship with the Ancestral Martial Dragon City the entire time.

Actually, their Wuming Clan had returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield for some time now.

The only reason they had not immediately proceeded to the Chu Heavenly Clan to cause trouble was because Wuming Doutian had not allowed it.

Wuming Doutian was naturally not afraid of the Chu Heavenly Clan. He was just giving face to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

Wuming Doutian had left for the Ancestral Martial Dragon City all by himself for some days now.

His intention was naturally to express his desire to retrieve the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord status. He hoped that Ancestral Martial Dragon City would support him.

Originally, the Wuming Clan had thought it would be a very simple task for them.

However, when Wuming Doutian had given no news even after being gone for some time, they realized that the issue at hand seemed to be rather problematic.

However, a few days before they’d arrived at the Chu Heavenly Clan, they suddenly received a confidential letter from Wuming Doutian.

The letter instructed them to go to the Chu Heavenly Clan on a specific day.

As such, they all believed that their Lord Clan Chief must’ve come to an agreement with the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

That was why they had come fully prepared.

Nevertheless, the person standing in front of them was Chu Feng of all people.

Before their Lord Clan Chief arrived, they did not dare to take him lightly.

If they ended up killing him by mistake and provoking the Ancestral Martial Dragon City as a consequence, even their Lord Clan Chief would not be able to save them.

Thinking of all those things, Wuming Fenghong suppressed the anger in his heart.

That said, the only reason he was able to suppress his anger was because he recalled that they had come prepared.

He felt that as long as they waited a while longer, until their Lord Clan Chief arrived, the Chu Heavenly Clan would suffer.

After all, as long as the Ancestral Martial Dragon City no longer placed Chu Feng under their protection, he would be like the Chu Heavenly Clan, an ant that could be easily crushed.

Wuming Fenghong looked at Chu Feng and cursed in his heart. ’Little bastard who takes advantage of your position to bully others, I’ll let you continue to act arrogant for now. Once our Lord Clan Chief arrives, I shall see whether you can continue to act this arrogant.’
