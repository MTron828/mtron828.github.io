Chapter 5547: The Emergence of the Evil Power

“May I start work right away?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course,” the man with white brows replied with a smile.

Chu Feng made his way to the weakest pill forging formation and began working. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The man with white brows and the other formation masters gathered around him, curious to know how talented the amnesiac man recommended by the high elder was. They were sorely disappointed by what they saw.

To be fair, the rate at which Chu Feng forged pills was not slow, but it was nowhere close to meeting their expectations. Initially, they thought that Chu Feng simply hadn’t accustomed himself to the work yet, but the latter showed no improvement as time passed.

Slowly, the spectators began to scatter till no one else was left.

Chu Feng could hear murmurs in the surroundings that the high elder had misjudged him. The attitude that the others took toward him also visibly cooled down.

None of them could have imagined that Chu Feng was doing it on purpose. He was intentionally forging the pills slowly lest he was assigned to another work post. After all, this was the formation in the Formation Master Hall that provided the best view of the sea of energy beneath.

As Chu Feng forged the pills, he continued to inspect the secrets behind the sea of energy beneath while eavesdropping on the conversations in his surroundings. He wanted to gather information on Little Fishy.

It was as he had expected. The formation masters stationed here knew far more than low-tier formation entities like 399.

First and foremost, he was able to gather a far more comprehensive picture of this realm.

There were hundreds of cities in the Star Sea Realm, and each of them was ruled by a city master except for the Star Sea Central City. However, the city masters weren’t the most powerful beings in this realm. Above them stood the chief elders, followed by the primal elder.

The primal elder was the most powerful person in the Star Sea Realm.

Meeting the city master was already a difficult feat. Most people lived their lives without meeting the chief elders, let alone the primal elder.

However, what Chu Feng was more concerned about was Little Fishy.

He learned that Little Fishy and Jie Tian were currently residing in the Star Sea Central City. There was no city master in the Star Sea Central City; it was the residence place of the chief elders and the primal elder. Thus, it was also the most important city in the Star Sea Realm.

The Star Sea Central City was usually closed off. Not even the city masters were allowed to enter its premises unless summoned by the chief elders.

By eavesdropping on the discussions, Chu Feng was able to figure out where the Star Sea Central City was at.

The Formation Master Hall would close at night, thus giving the formation masters some time to themselves. Chu Feng decided to make use of this time to head to the Star Sea Central City. While he was unable to tap into his own spirit power, he was still able to exert his world spiritist techniques with the spirit power he was cloaked in. Naturally, concealment formations weren’t beyond his means either.

He first concealed himself in a formation before making his way to the Star Sea Central City, hoping to see if he could sneak in to find Little Fishy. To his dismay, his path was blocked by a powerful barrier that was beyond his current means to decipher.

He would at least have to reach White Dragon God-cloak before he would stand a chance against this barrier, but even so, it was not guaranteed that he would be able to pull it off.

“Hm?”

Chu Feng suddenly felt a peculiar energy seeping into his heart. It was mild, but upon closer observation, he noticed that this energy had a seductive property. While it wouldn’t affect him in the short run, it could slowly pile up over time and shake his state of mind.

“Eggy, I feel the evil power they spoke about,” Chu Feng said.

“Where?” Eggy asked.

“It’s invading my body, though it’s still weak at the moment. Most people wouldn’t notice its presence at all. I suspect that the traitors who turned against the Star Sea Realm didn’t willingly do it. I’m guessing that their minds were slowly taken over by the evil power, resulting in them defecting before they know it,” Chu Feng said.

“Can you tell where this energy is from?” Eggy asked.

“I can’t tell, but the energy is probably quite powerful given how it discreetly slips into the body. I feel a familiar vibe from it—it’s likely related to the assimilation formation. I suspect that the assimilation formation we encountered earlier was a product of the evil power,” Chu Feng said.

“That means that the evil power is in contact with someone outside, right? I’d guess that it’s trying to devour cultivators outside to strengthen itself. As for who it’s working with, my bet is that it’s the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master,” Eggy guessed.

“That’s most likely it. It looks like the Star Sea Realm will be in huge trouble at this rate,” Chu Feng said.

“This evil power is unlikely to be something you can deal with in your current state. You should quickly find Little Fishy and bring her out of here,” Eggy said worriedly.

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded in agreement.

In the following days, Chu Feng spent most of his time forging pills in the Formation Master Hall while deciphering the secret of this realm. At the same time, he siphoned spirit power from the sea of energy to strengthen his own spirit power.

He made huge progress in just a few days, raising his spirit power from rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation to White Dragon God-cloak. At the same time, he benefited greatly from his continuous attempts to decipher the sea of energy. By now, he already had some idea as to how he could control the spirit power and construct formation entities.

The only problem was that he had reached a bottleneck. He was unable to decipher anything else from the sea of energy or raise his spirit power anymore. Nevertheless, he persevered on, hoping to push himself to a higher level.

It also went without saying that he had been concealing his spirit power, as there were strict requirements for each workstation. Should they discover that he had already reached White Dragon God-cloak level, he would be promoted to a high formation master or even an elder. That would mean that he couldn’t stay in his current job and peer into the sea of energy.

However, Chu Feng suddenly received a piece of news that squeezed his heart. It was concerning Little Fishy.
