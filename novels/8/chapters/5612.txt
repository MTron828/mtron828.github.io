Chapter 5612: Meeting Zhang Yingxiong Again

It was a black-robed young man who looked so average that most people would have overlooked him on the streets. However, he was no ordinary person.

“Zhang Yingxiong?” Chu Feng blurted out.

Zhang Yingxiong was an extremely secretive individual.

Chu Feng had defeated him in a battle once before, but he knew that the other party didn’t utilize his full strength. Zhang Yingxiong was also the one who had brought out the Immemorial Fate Stone, claiming that there were only nine people in the world who could induce three rays of light from it.

These nine people were the Nine Sons of Fate, and they would be the ones to save the world of cultivation from a future catastrophe. Chu Feng and Zhang Yingxiong were a part of them.

Last but not least, Zhang Yingxiong had given a letter to Chu Feng, claiming that it was from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. The letter contained information about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s teleportation formation and details about its formation. Chu Feng followed the instructions in the letter and found the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s teleportation formation.

However, he later discovered that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t know Zhang Yingxiong or the latter’s master.

“What a coincidence, Brother Chu Feng! You’re in the Immortal Stream Upper Realm too?” Zhang Yingxiong excitedly walked up to Chu Feng as if reuniting with an old friend.

“Zhang Yingxiong, you’re from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy too?” Chu Feng asked.

He knew right away that Zhang Yingxiong was the one who had opened the Nine Realms Immortal Region—the latter definitely had the means to do so—just that he was surprised since he had always thought that Zhang Yingxiong wasn’t from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

“I’m the same as you. Even though I wasn’t born in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, I spent so much time in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy that I see it as my home. That might be why the Nine Realms Immortal Region allowed me to enter through the Ancestral Martial entrance,” Zhang Yingxiong said.

“Were you the one who opened this place?” Chu Feng sought confirmation.

“Yes, I was the one who opened this place. I happened to pass by this area, so I figured I might as well give it a try. Who could have thought that it opened just like that?” Zhang Yingxiong said with a chuckle.

“Why did you help me back then?” Chu Feng asked.

“Help you? When did I help you?” Zhang Yingxiong was confused.

“I asked my master. He doesn’t know you or your master, which means that you forged that letter. However, the information regarding the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s entrance was real,” Chu Feng said.

“I did it under my master’s instructions,” Zhang Yingxiong said.

“If it’s not too much to ask, may I know who’s your master? Is he related to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?” Chu Feng asked.

He thought that Zhang Yingxiong’s master was related to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, considering how much he knew about it.

“My master never told me, and I never bothered to ask. Brother Chu Feng, you shouldn’t ask. Everyone has their own secrets. It’s the case for my master and I, but it’s probably the case for you too, right?” Zhang Yingxiong asked with a smile.

“All right,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

There was no point probing any deeper since Zhang Yingxiong was reluctant to speak.

“Brother Chu Feng, can you do me a favor?” Zhang Yingxiong suddenly asked.

“What favor do you need from me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Brother Chu Feng, the lake beneath contains water from the Immortal Stream. I have reached a bottleneck in my cultivation, and I need to strengthen my physical body to advance. As long as I assimilate the energy inside the Immortal Stream and reinforce my body and soul, I should be able to overcome my bottleneck. I can impart to you the way to assimilate the energy to you, but I’ll take 70% of the energy while you take 30%. What do you think?” Zhang Yingxiong asked.

Fearing that Chu Feng wouldn’t accept the deal, Zhang Yongxiong anxiously added, “It’s not that I'm being greedy here, but I’d have made this trip in vain if I don’t at least absorb 70% of the energy.”

”Made this trip in vain? That means that you came here for the Nine Realms Immortal Region’s Immortal Stream. I suppose that the appearance of the Nine Realms Immortal Region isn’t a coincidence either. You were the one who activated it, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Ah…” Zhang Yingxiong’s mouth opened agape. He spent a moment in dilemma before finally replying, “You’re a brother of mine, so I don’t want to lie to you. Yes, I used my master’s means to find the Nine Realms Immortal Region and activated it. Part of the reason I was able to induce the opening of the eight gates was because I tapped on the insights of those who came before us. My master is a formidable figure who’s not beneath your master, after all.”

“All right, I’ll help you,” Chu Feng replied.

To be frank, there was no close ties between the two of them, but Chu Feng owed him a favor for delivering the letter that allowed him to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, regardless of his intentions behind that.

“Heh! Thanks, Brother Chu Feng.” Zhang Yingxiong grinned. He drew out a cultivation skill and said, “This is the method.”

“You have a high opinion of me,” Chu Feng remarked. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The cultivation skill was so complicated that even Chu Feng would require some time to grasp it. It would have been difficult for ordinary cultivators to learn it.

“Of course! Brother Chu Feng, your talent is nowhere beneath mine. There’s no way this could pose a problem to you!” Zhang Yingxiong expressed his unwavering confidence in Chu Feng. “Can you help me find the most suitable place to cultivate here? I haven’t found it yet.”

“Let me see.”

Chu Feng scanned his surroundings with his Heaven’s Eyes, but he was unable to figure out the ideal location to cultivate at. He took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, but it refused to provide him with guidance.

In the end, he gave up and said, “I can’t find it either.”

“Don’t worry, I have already found a good place to cultivate at, just that it feels a bit lacking. Give me a moment; I’ll take another look around. We’ll cultivate at the spot I found if I can’t find anywhere better,” Zhang Yingxiong said.

He moved so quickly that he disappeared in the blink of an eye.

“Fast! Is that fellow’s cultivation above yours?” Eggy asked.

“He’s definitely stronger than me,” Chu Feng said.

“It sure is nice to have a strong backing. You’d have been much stronger than him if you had a formidable master to nurture you from a young age. Who knows? You might have even reached Heavenly God level by now,” Eggy said.

Chu Feng burst into laughter. “I actually think I’m in a better position than him even though my cultivation is progressing slower.”

“You must be joking, right? Are you saying that you prefer to fumble around alone and brave through danger?” Eggy exclaimed in disbelief. She felt bad for Chu Feng.

“Who says that I’m fumbling around alone? I have you, Milady Queen. Our Eggy is beautiful, and you have a euphonious voice too. I would rather have you as my company than an old man,” Chu Feng teased.

“You and your slippery tongue! Well, I guess there’s some truth in your words. Hehe!” Eggy revealed a sweet smile. She wasn’t averse to Chu Feng’s bootlicking.
