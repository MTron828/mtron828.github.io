Chapter 4855: Evil Motive

Chu Feng’s deduction was verified by Long Xiaoxiao’s account. Her mother had indeed been kidnapped by the Holy Light Clan, and her marriage was to be held a month from now.

As for where Long Xiaoxiao’s mother was captured and why the marriage had to be a month from now, she had no answers to those questions.

The same applied to the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief too.

“Don’t worry. There’s someone here who can provide us with the answers,” Chu Feng said.

He released the barrier, letting Shengguang Yunyue’s cries loose once more. Her voice sounded much feebler than before, a reflection of the current physical state she was in.

She was still alive, but she looked like she would drop dead at any moment.

“Kill me, Chu Feng... Kill me...”

Shengguang Yunyue spoke with a tearful voice. She must have cried for quite a long time while her voice was muffled by the barrier.

She was still sniffling, but there were no more tears for her to shed.

Her mental barrier had completely collapsed by this moment, leaving her unable to uphold her previous high and mighty attitude anymore. Right now, she only wished for a quick death.

It was just that she couldn’t even take her own life due to the restraints Chu Feng had put on her. She could only pray for him to end her life.

“Beg me for it.”

Chu Feng gazed down on Shengguang Yunyue coldly.

He could still remember the contemptuous gaze she had directed at him back then, almost as if he was an ant. She tried to kill him back then, but he managed to escape from her grasp.

It was refreshing how the tables were turned between them.

“Kill me... I beg you!!!”

Despite Chu Feng’s insulting words, Shengguang Yunyue didn’t hesitate to beg him to let her off. The excruciating pain had already forced out every last bit of her arrogance. All she wanted now was death, even if she had to give up her dignity for it.

Even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief couldn’t believe what he was seeing here.

However, Chu Feng didn’t end her life right away. Instead, with a cold sneer, he brought out a black vat.

This vat looked similar to the one that had the black snakes sealed in it, but it was covered in talismans.

Jip jip jip!

Sharp squeaking sounds could be immediately heard from the vats. Despite the talismans plastered on the vat, it was still shaking violently.

Were it not for Chu Feng stepping down on it with his leg, the vat might have just exploded from all the rattling.

It was not too difficult for one to figure that something terrifying was sealed inside the vat.

“W-what are you going to do? C-Chu Feng! I have already put down my pride to beg you! All I want is just a quick death! Are you not even going to give me that?!”

Shengguang Yunyue was horrified to see the vat. Despite the excruciating pain she was already being put through, the presence of the vat still rattled her nerves.

She knew that Chu Feng was intending to use the vat against her, and it scared her.

“Tell me where Long Xiaoxiao’s mother is imprisoned,” Chu Feng questioned.

“Kill me if you want, but I’ll never betray the Holy Light Clan!” Shengguang Yunyue bellowed with ferocity that was at odds with her feeble state.

She garnered all of her strength to declare her unwavering loyalty toward the Holy Light Clan, only to be faced with Chu Feng’s sneer.

He kicked the vat down, and the talisman papers fell off from it.

Jip jip jip!

Many insects that were the size of a fingernail crawled out from the vat. Despite their small size, they looked even more frightening than the black snakes.

They were green spiders with human heads and hair. They had long green tongues that were filled with reverse spikes that left one feeling revulsed.

“W-what are those things?”

Shengguang Yunyue’s face distorted in horror.

Jip jip jip!

Chu Feng couldn’t be bothered to answer her question. He flung his sleeves grandly, and the spiders immediately jumped onto Shengguang Yunyue to feast on her body.

Despite having almost lost all of her strength, Shengguang Yunyue still let out a heart-wrenching scream.

“S-stop! Stop! I’ll speak! I’ll speak!!!”

Shengguang Yunyue quickly caved in.

Chu Feng snapped his finger, and the spiders quickly halted their assault. However, they continued standing on top of her body, ready to resume their feast should her response be unsatisfactory.

Shengguang Yunyue knew better than to test Chu Feng’s patience, so she quickly told him where Long Xiaoxiao’s mother was imprisoned.

It was one of the forbidden lands of the Holy Light Clan, guarded by one of the other grand elders.

Anyone else would have despaired upon hearing that news, but not Chu Feng.

There was no one else in the Holy Light Clan that was a match for him other than Shengguang Xuanye.

So, he continued his questioning, “Why did you decide to hold the marriage a month from now?”

The day they had decided for Long Xiaoxiao’s marriage was not an auspicious day, which led Chu Feng to think that there might be a deeper meaning as to why the Holy Light Clan was specifically chosen that day.

“I-it’s...”

Shengguang Yunyue began hesitating once more.

“It looks like you have forgotten the plight you are in.”

Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed in viciousness. Even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief dared not to look at his face despite being just an onlooker here.

He had known all along that Chu Feng was no pushover, but he thought nothing about it since he was the stronger one back then. But now that Chu Feng had the decisive advantage in terms of cultivation, it started to dawn on him just how terrifying a person Chu Feng could be.

Shengguang Yunyue submitted right away.

“I’ll speak, I’ll speak!

“Our clan chief realized that Long Xiaoxiao’s heart wouldn’t be with us even after marrying into our Holy Light Clan, so he prepared a formation for her. This formation came from an ancient remnant, and it wields the power to convert one’s bloodline into a cultivation resource. It’s just that it has strict conditions, such that it can only be activated at a specific time,” Shengguang Yunyue explained. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief’s complexion turned horrible upon hearing those words.

Chu Feng glared at Shengguang Yunyue with eyes widened with rage.

They thought that the Holy Light Clan just wanted Long Xiaoxiao to marry into their family, but they were actually planning to turn her into a cultivation resource for their own clan members!

The Holy Light Clan were supposed to be the overseers of the Holy Light Galaxy! Yet, how were their actions any different from a demonic sect?
