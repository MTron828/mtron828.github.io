Chapter 5870: The Voice Inside

There’ll be no future if I lose here. The resources I have are lacking compared to his. If I can’t even best him in terms of talent, how can I ever catch up to him?

Grar!

With such a thought in mind, Chu Feng’s psyche began gushing out like a ferocious beast. To win this battle, he began releasing his psyche without any concern about the outcome, in hopes that he could bridge the gap between them through sheer quantity.

But as Chu Feng’s psyche became stronger, Jie Tianran’s psyche became stronger as well. The latter was resorting to the same tactic.

At this point, it was just a question of whose foundation was stronger.

“It looks like this is all you have, Chu Feng,” Jie Tianran sneered.

Chu Feng snorted in response, “I don’t claim to be impressive, but I am more than enough to deal with your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s juniors. As for you... tsk tsk, you already have a foot in the grave, but you’re still struggling to match a junior like me.

“I don’t know where you find the courage to criticize me. As the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, don’t you feel ashamed to see how your organization is ailing under your leadership? If you ask me, my mother is the only true talent in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. The rest are just for show.”

“You sure know how to run your mouth. I am now in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Do you dare to show yourself before me?” Jie Tianran asked.

“How are you able to speak in such a righteous tone when you’re taking advantage of a junior here? I see that you have lost all your shame. Also, weren’t you the first one to start the taunts to shake my mind? You sure know how to reshape reality to your convenience. Does your skin grow thicker with age?

“Hai, my mother sure is unfortunate to be born to a father like you. My grandmother must be blind to have chosen an old tree trunk like you for a husband. I guess the two of them must be lamenting how fate has been cruel to them,” Chu Feng sneered.

“You...”

Jie Tianran widened his eyes in fury. If not for the restrictions here, he would have reduced Chu Feng to dust with a single slap.

He was someone who valued his honor and dignity. He was a prodigy, and he had grown up listening to compliments from others. No one had ever spoken to him in such a manner before.

To make things worse, Chu Feng saw through his intention. He planned to shake Chu Feng up through words, but that wasn’t a viable option. If anything, he was the one being shaken up instead.

Seeing that it was impossible to get under Chu Feng’s skin, he decided to shut his mouth.

An hour passed, but there was still no outcome to their battle.

“He’s actually this powerful?”

Chu Feng maintained a poker face, but he was panicking inside. He had already reached his limit, and he was only holding on by paying a terrible price.

However, his worries soon faded. Jie Tianran had reached his limit too, as his psyche had started to weaken.

“Heh... Jie Tianran, it looks like this opportunity is going to slip through your fingers,” Chu Feng scoffed.

“You bastard! How did you even get in here?!” Jie Tianran roared.

He had to resort to an invaluable, one-time-use treasure to decipher the gates, so he couldn’t understand how Chu Feng was able to get here.

“It’s all thanks to you. Your treasure sure was convenient,” Chu Feng replied.

“You were there too?” Jie Tianran exclaimed.

He was taken aback as he had constructed a huge observation formation in the vicinity, so he should have detected Chu Feng if the latter was around. Due to that, he thought that Chu Feng had observed the gates before he arrived and used some other means to get here.

Yet, it turned out that Chu Feng was observing the gates alongside him! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

That only further infuriated him,

“Don’t be so surprised, Jie Tianran. There are many formidable means in the world. It’s normal for you to have overlooked me. Or do you think that the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect is the only power superior to your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? Don’t kid yourself. Your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has never been the strongest power in the vast world of cultivation, not in the past, not in the present, and not in the future,” Chu Feng said.

By this point, Chu Feng’s consciousness had started to become fuzzy. He knew he was on the verge of being evicted from this place, but he wasn’t worried as he could see Jie Tianran’s figure becoming blurry too.

Jie Tianran had reached his limit too and was about to be evicted from this place.

Chu Feng might have failed, but Jie Tianran didn’t succeed either. The one who had lost more was Jie Tianran, as Chu Feng had only slipped in with the aid of Jie Tianran’s treasure.

“Chu Feng, it’s only a matter of time before you fall into my hands. You can be sure I’ll siphon away everything you inherited from your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, just like what I did to your mother,” Jie Tianran snarled.

His anger could be heard in his voice. If not for Chu Feng, he could have entered the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city.

“I pray that you’re lying, Jie Tianran. I could have spared you on my mother’s account, but if something happens to her, I’ll bury you and your beloved Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Chu Feng replied before his consciousness was sent back to his main body.

He could see Jie Tianran’s motionless body not too far away, but all of a sudden, the latter turned around with incredibly sharp eyes. Jie Tianran was using a special means to search for his whereabouts.

“Send me back, Lord Sectmaster,” Chu Feng hurriedly contacted the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster with a frail voice.

The sectmaster could tell that something was amiss, so she quickly activated the teleportation formation and brought him back.

Jie Tianran continued searching the area, but he was unable to find Chu Feng.

“Lord Mansion Master, what’s wrong?”

The elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion saw the savagery in Jie Tianran’s eyes and knew that something must have happened.

“You bunch of wastrels!” Jie Tianran sneered before flitting away.

The elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion looked at one another with pale faces. They didn’t know what they had done wrong, but their Mansion Master’s rage still filled them with fear.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng lay in the teleportation passageway in a weakened condition. He didn’t feel anything much back in that space, but his head was now hurting so much that he felt like it would explode. After all, he had squeezed every last bit of psyche within him.

Despite the agony he was in, he couldn’t scream or move at all. His body had reached its limit.

Similarly, Jie Tianran returned to his chamber In the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s floating warship and hurriedly constructed a barrier before collapsing to the ground. His body twitched nonstop, and large mouthfuls of black blood flowed from not just his mouth but his eyes, ears, and nostrils as well.

No one had ever seen Jie Tianran in such a weakened state before. His condition was even worse than Chu Feng’s, and speaking was beyond him too.

Yet, there was a voice that echoed from his body, “Jie Tianran, you’re useless. If not for my help, you would have lost to your grandson today.”
