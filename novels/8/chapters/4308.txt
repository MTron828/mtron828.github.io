Chapter 4308 - Lovesickness

“Wuqing?”

Chu Feng was confused by that word Xianhai Shaoyu said all of a sudden. A look of puzzle filled his eyes.

He was confused as to why Xianhai Shaoyu suddenly said those words. He found it completely baffling.

Seeing the confused look on Chu Feng, Xianhai Shaoyu added, “You couldn’t possibly have forgotten about the alias you’ve used in the past?”

“You...”

Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously upon hearing those words. At the same time, his heart was no longer capable of remaining calm.

After Xianhai Shaoyu called to his attention, Chu Feng knew why he said ‘wuqing.’

Back when Chu Feng was still a youngster, for the sake of rescuing Zi Ling, he used an alias when he left the Nine Provinces Continent to make his way in the Eastern Sea Region.

That alias was Wuqing. But, that was something that happened so long ago, something from the Lower Realm. The only people that knew about his alias were people that were close to him, his friends from the Lower Realm.

While Chu Feng doesn’t know Xianhai Shaoyu’s true identity, he could easily guess that Xianhai Shaoyu was most likely not someone from the Holy Light Galaxy. Instead, he belonged to some sort of colossus in the vast martial cultivation world.

Only an identity that grand would be able to match what Xianhai Shaoyu had done.

But, such a Xianhai Shaoyu should have absolutely no connection with Chu Feng from the time when he was in the Lower Realm.

Thus, how did Xianhai Shaoyu know of his alias?

“It would appear that you still remember.”

Seeing the shocked reaction from Chu Feng, Xianhai Shaoyu smiled.

Then, he said, “Then, do you still remember Little Fishy from the Everlasting Sea of Blood?”

Xianhai Shaoyu’s words were like a heavy hammer striking abruptly at Chu Feng’s head.

Chu Feng was so shocked that he was somewhat dumbstruck.

How could he not remember Little Fishy?

She was a child Chu Feng met in the Eastern Sea Region’s Everlasting Sea of Blood.

She was a very usual child.

Although they’ve only interacted for a brief period, she left a deep impression on Chu Feng.

“Brother Shaoyu, you...”

“Exactly who are you?”

Earlier, Chu Feng didn’t mind if Xianhai Shaoyu did not reveal his identity to him.

But now, he was eager to know who Xianhai Shaoyu was and what relationship he had with that child Little Fishy.

“Brother Chu Feng, my name is the same. But, I’ve lied to you about my surname.”

“I am not called Fumo Shaoyu. My real surname is Xianhai. My real name is Xianhai Shaoyu.”

“Xin’er is my clansman. Lady Gusu is also my clansman.”

“But, Xin’er is not my younger sister and Lady Gusu is not my grandma.”

“Our relationship was deliberately fabricated to deceive you.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“We all came from the same clan, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.”

“My father is the Immortal Sea FIsh Clan’s Clan Chief. That is why both Xin’er and Lady Gusu addressed me as young master.”

“I also have a younger sister of the same father and mother. Her name is Xianhai Yu’er,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Xianhai Yu’er is Little Fishy?”

“Thus, you are Little Fishy’s older brother?!!!” asked Chu Feng.

Xianhai Shaoyu did not verbally answer him. But, he nodded his head.

Seeing Xianhai Shaoyu nodding his head, Chu Feng, more than shock, was feeling overjoyed.

He had a good impression of Xianhai Shaoyu to begin with and regarded him as a friend. Else, he wouldn’t have entered through that spirit formation gate to come to this starry sky to rescue Xianhai Shaoyu knowing full well the dangers it contained.

Upon learning that Xianhao Shaoyu was actually Little Fishy’s older brother, he felt that the relationship between him and Xianhai Shaoyu grew even closer.

“How’s Little Fishy doing right now?” asked Chu Feng excitedly.

He had thought that he would never be able to meet Little Fishy again.

But, judging from the way things went now, it seemed like he would be able to meet that child again.

After all, he had learned of her true identity.

“You don’t have to worry about my younger sister. She’s doing very good.”

“The only thing that’s been distressing her is her lovesickness. She’s always thinking about one person, a man that left an influential impression on her,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Oh?” Chu Feng grew interested after hearing that.

Thinking back, while Little Fishy was only a child back then, she should have grown to a big beauty by now.

After all, it has been many years since then. Chu Feng was no longer the youngster from back then. Instead, he had grown into a young man.

“It would appear that child Little Fishy has someone she likes too.”

“Brother Shaoyu, why don’t you tell me who that child Little Fishy likes. It must be interesting,” Chu Feng sighed emotionally before a mischievous smile appeared on his face.

He was truly feeling emotional about how miraculous the passage of time was.

Thinking back, what happened back then seemed like yesterday. In terms of time, Chu Feng doesn’t seem to have too much of a concept for it apart from his nonstop growth.

But, thinking back to how that chippy Little Fishy who followed behind him while calling him big brother had her own beloved now, Chu Feng suddenly discovered that it has been so long since then.

“Brother Chu Feng, the person my sister likes is none other than you,” Xianhai Shaoyu said with a beaming smile.

“Wha?”

Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously upon hearing those words. The mischievous smile on his face disappeared in an instant.

Seeing the shocked expression on Chu Feng, the smile on Xianhai Shaoyu grew even more intense.

“Brother Shaoyu, you can’t make this kind of joke.”

“When I knew your little sister, she was still only a child,” said Chu Feng.

“My little sister is an early-maturing girl,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

Seeing how serious Xianhai Shaoyu was as he said those words, Chu Feng shook his head.

He pretended that Xianhai Shaoyu was joking and not being serious.

His curiosity toward who the person Little Fishy was into disappeared instantly.

After all, Xianhai Shaoyu was someone truly fond of joking around. Earlier, he even gave Chu Feng an impression that he was into men.

“Brother Chu Feng, you shouldn’t pretend to be naive.”

“My little sister is waiting for you to marry her.”

“Only you can cure her lovesickness,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Brother Shaoyu, you should joking around while you can. It’s no longer funny if you keep making the same joke,” Chu Feng said to Xianhai Shaoyu.

While Chu Feng was not against people making fun of him, Little Fishy was someone with a special meaning in Chu Feng’s heart.

As she was very young when they met, the impression Chu Feng had of her remained at that of a child.

In Chu Feng’s heart, Little Fishy was a child. She was a child that needed love and concern, a child that needed people to protect her.

To say that child Little Fishy likes him, that was simply something completely improper.

Because of that, Chu Feng didn’t like this joke Xianhai Shaoyu was making.

“I am truly not joking with you. You don’t know how much my little sister likes you.”

“As the princess of our Immortal Sea Fish Clan, she is not only loved by our clan’s younger generations, she is also sought after by the people of the younger generation all throughout the vast martial cultivation world.”

“That’s even more true as my little sister was deemed as the number one beauty in our Immortal Sea Fish Clan.”

“On top of that, her talent surpasses my own. You can imagine how popular she is.”

“But, a girl as popular as her continued to be lost in thought while she stared at an Elite Armament level foot bracelet everyday. Say, if that’s not lovesickness, what could it be?”

Xianhai Shaoyu still had a beaming smile as he looked to Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng who thought Xianhai Shaoyu was joking earlier seemed to have received a major shock in his heart. He felt his heart tensing up.

An Elite Armament level foot bracelet?

Xianhai Shaoyu seemed to be talking about the present he gave to Little Fishy before they part back then.
