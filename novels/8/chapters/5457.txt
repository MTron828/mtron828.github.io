Chapter 5457: Relationship Between Siblings

Chu Feng walked up to the World Spiritist Painter and said, “Elder, let’s find somewhere else to talk.”

He had to explain this matter to the World Spiritist Painter since the monster came from the All Lives Are Equal Palace, and the World Spiritist Painter was its master. However, this wasn’t a convenient place to talk, since there were far too many ears around.

“All right.” The World Spiritist Painter nodded.

Long Kuitian first suppressed Jia Lingyi to keep her in place, though it was not as if she could escape from them now that she had lost her cultivation, treasures, and her aides. Following that, Chu Feng, Long Muxi, Long Chengyu, and the others headed to the mountain valley inside the All Lives Are Equal Palace.

Chu Feng honestly told the World Spiritist Painter about everything that had happened, including the fact that he was only able to control the monster through the Dao of Absolute Darkness.

He did have a motive for talking about the Dao of Absolute Darkness—he was hoping to get some clues about its origin. While this power was currently under his control, he felt that it was far too enigmatic simply because he lacked understanding of it. He thought that the knowledgeable World Spiritist Painter might have heard about it.

“I never thought that young friend Chu Feng would have such a tremendous fortuitous encounter as to obtain such incredible power. While I don’t know what the Dao of Absolute Darkness is, it must be a formidable power to be able to control that malevolent being!” the World Spiritist Painter exclaimed.

“Young friend Chu Feng is a person of great luck.”

Long Kuitian and Long Suqing praised Chu Feng too.

However, it was evident from their responses that none of them knew about the Dao of Absolute Darkness.

“My deepest apologies, elder. I took control of the malevolent being without asking for your permission. I know that what I did was wrong, and I’ll willingly accept any punishment you exact on me,” Chu Feng said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you don’t need to stand on ceremony with me. In the first place, the malevolent being has always been an unstable factor in this place. You have seen for yourself that there are plenty of people who covet it. Should the malevolent being be released under normal circumstances, it would have spelled my downfall. You have done me a great favor by taking that malevolent being away from here. If anything, I should be thanking you instead of punishing you,” the World Spiritist Painter said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, the World Spiritist Painter is right. You shouldn’t get too bothered by this,” Long Suqing said.

“There’s no need to feel guilty. It’s all heaven’s will. You mentioned that your Dao of Absolute Darkness requires a medium to forge a secret skill, and it just so happens that you encountered that monster here that fulfills your requirement. This is a fortuitous encounter in itself. Heaven is obviously guiding your way, and it wouldn’t do to defy heaven’s will,” Long Chengyu said.

It was rather surprising to hear a brawny man like him talking about heaven’s will.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you shouldn’t even think about compensating me. Know that I won’t accept any compensation from you,” the World Spiritist Painter emphasized.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll gratefully accept it. Speaking of which, elder, I have a request to make,” Chu Feng said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, feel free to speak your thoughts. I know that it hasn’t been long since we met, but I feel an indescribable sense of intimacy with you,” the World Spiritist Painter said.

“It’d be highly beneficial to the construction of my secret skill if there’s a formation to support me. By any chance, is there such a place inside the All Lives Are Equal Palace?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course there is! My All Lives Are Equal Palace has palaces for one to train their martial cultivation, spirit power, and weaponry. It goes without saying that there’s a place to create secret skills too! However, it may take some time for me to activate the formation as I haven’t used that place in a long while. Do you mind waiting for a bit?” the World Spiritist Painter asked.

“Yes, I’m willing to wait. I’m not in a hurry,” Chu Feng replied.

“Very well. I’ll activate the formation right now,” the World Spiritist Painter said.

He headed to the mountain valley where Chu Feng and the others had admired the paintings earlier and formed a series of hand seals. A spirit formation gate manifested on the cliff face. This spirit formation gate led to the palace that could aid Chu Feng in the construction of his secret skill.

In truth, Chu Feng could have forged the secret skill without any external help, but it wouldn’t hurt to have the support for a formation. He had long noticed that the All Lives Are Equal Palace wasn’t as simple as it seemed, and it would appear that his intuition was on point.

In fact, his senses told him that the World Spiritist Painter had barely scraped the surface of what the All Lives Are Equal Palace was capable of. Its true function might very well surpass their wildest imagination.

“Chengyu, didn’t you head to the Nine Heaven’s Zenith to spar with the others? How did it go?” Long Suqing asked.

Chu Feng and Long Muxi glanced over. They were curious about this too, especially since the event was a huge deal. After all, the participants of the Nine Heaven’s Zenith were the strongest juniors in the world of cultivation.

“Eysh, don’t talk about that. That Nine Zenith Old Monk canceled the spar under the claim that someone was missing from the invitation list,” Long Chengyu lamented.

“Ah? Did someone on the invitation list fail to attend the event?” Long Suqing asked.

“Everyone on the invitation list was there, and that’s why it’s even more frustrating for me. It’s clearly his fault here. He should be glad that we aren’t pursuing the matter! I proposed that we carry on with the tournament first and that we could simply hold another one on a later date with him inviting everyone who should be there. Yet, he refused to budge on his stance no matter what!” Long Chengyu raged.

“Chu Feng, can we have a chat?” Long Muxi suddenly asked Chu Feng.

“Of course,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Chengyu, let’s talk somewhere else,” Long Suqing said.

“Why should we talk somewhere else? They can talk about their stuff while we talk about ours. Brother Chu Feng isn’t an outsider anyway, right?” Long Chengyu scoffed before flashing a grin at Chu Feng.

“Who said that Chu Feng is the outsider here?” Long Muxi glared at Long Chengyu in displeasure.

“Oof… Fine, fine, I get it. Slowly take your time to talk, all right? We’ll find somewhere else.” Intimidated by Long Muxi, Long Chengyu flashed her a fawning smile before backing off.

Seeing that, the World Spiritist Painter opened two palaces, one for Long Chengyu and the others, and one for Chu Feng and Long Muxi. With that, Chu Feng and Long Muxi finally got some private time together.

“Do you blame me for not telling you my identity?” Long Muxi asked.

“Of course not,” Chu Feng replied.

“I know that you wouldn’t, but I have my difficulties too. You should be able to tell that I have a strained relationship with the Totem Dragon Clan,” Long Muxi said.

“Miss Bai… Ah, should I call you Miss Long instead?”

Before Chu Feng could finish his words, Long Muxi interjected, “You can continue calling me Miss Bai, but Long Muxi works too. I don’t particularly mind what my friends choose to call me.”

“How about Miss Muxi?” Chu Feng asked.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Sure.” Long Muxi nodded.

“Miss Muxi, if it’s convenient, would you tell me about your affairs?”

Chu Feng was also curious about Long Muxi’s relationship with the Totem Dragon Clan, especially since he noticed that there was something off about her attitude toward Long Chengyu.

She wasn’t just joking around. Her eyes were truly cold, carrying a hint of animosity.
