Chapter 2644 - The Confident Chu Feng

“I shall see what other tricks you might have.”

Chu Feng knew very well that the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was preparing some sort of ability.

However, Chu Feng was filled with confidence. He was confident that he would be able to kill the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. Thus... even though Chu Feng knew very well that the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was preparing some sort of ability, he did not stop him. Instead, Chu Feng actually stayed the Ancient Era’s War Sword’s attack.

Just like that, he quietly waited. He wanted to know exactly what the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster would do.

Chu Feng planned to utterly defeat the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

Chu Feng wanted to make him realize that he would still be able to take his cur life even without utilizing the power of the Evil God Sword.

He wanted to get justice for his friends using his own strength.

“Buzz~~~”

Actually, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster finished preparing his trick very quickly.

Suddenly, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster clasped his palms together. The Immortal-level martial power that covered the sky above him started to gather together, and formed an enormous sword.

That sword was also golden in color. Not only was it emitting golden light, but it also appeared to be very life-like. It did not resemble something created with martial power. Instead, it resembled an enormous sword forged with gold.

Enormous sword, it was indeed an enormous sword. That enormous sword was over two thousand meters long. Even when looking at the sword from afar, it was still an actual colossus.

Before that enormous sword, the Ancient Era’s War Sword’s several hundred meter-length appeared to be extremely small.

Most importantly, the aura emitted by the enormous sword was also extremely fierce.

It was an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was no ordinary Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill. Instead, it was an extremely powerful Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.

However, after the martial skill was formed, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster did not rush to immediately attack Chu Feng with it.

Instead, dark black gaseous flames started to emit from his body. Those dark black gaseous flames were assimilated into the Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.

In the blink of an eye, the enormous golden sword turned dark black.

Most importantly, the cries of infants were sounding nonstop from that enormous dark black sword. It was truly extremely horrifying.

At that moment, the power of that Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill increased by an entire level.

“This is bad. The martial skill the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster is unleashing right now has fused with his demonic technique.”

“That demonic technique is simply too strange. Although Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword is very powerful, it remains that Chu Feng’s cultivation is actually a level below that of the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.”

At that moment, Zi Xunyi revealed a worried expression. She was able to sense that the aura of the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s enormous dark black sword had completely surpassed Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword.

If the two of them were to fight, it would likely be very unfavorable for Chu Feng.

“W-With how c-confident my b-brother is acting, h-he m-most definitely possesses c-certainty in v-victory. The I-Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster w-will n-not be a m-match f-for my brother,” Compared to Zi Xunyi, Wang Qiang was filled with confidence in Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, I will let you have a taste of the power of my Infant Soul Demon Sword.”

“I will have you know exactly whether it is your Ancient Era’s War Sword or my Infant Soul Demon Sword that is stronger.”

As the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster said those words, he began to form hand seals with one hand. Then, he pointed at Chu Feng with his other hand.

“Boom~~~”

The next moment, that so-called Infant Soul Demon Sword carried with it countless infant cries, a frightening aura and majestic oppressive might as it was shot toward the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

That’s right, the Infant Soul Demon Sword was aimed at the Ancient Era’s War Sword, and not Chu Feng.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s intention was clear. He wanted to destroy Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword so as to manifest his strength.

“Precisely what I wanted.”

Chu Feng was not to be outdone. He too urged the Ancient Era’s War Sword to attack the Infant Soul Demon Sword.

At that moment, how could Ying Mingchao, Zi Xunyi, Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong and the others have the heart to continue healing their injuries?

All of them were staring at the battle ahead. All of them wanted to know exactly who would win the battle.

After all, this was not only a battle that concerned victory and defeat, it was also a battle that concerned one’s honor and disgrace.

Finally, the two enormous swords reached one another.

One was an enormous dark black sword reaching two thousand meters in length.

The other was an enormous golden sword reaching three hundred meters in length.

One was called the Infant Soul Demon Sword and emitted an overwhelming demonic aura.

The other was called the Ancient Era’s War Sword, and was filled with extraordinary battle intent.

“Rumble~~~”

Finally, the two enormous swords collided.

At that moment, dark black gaseous flames started to surge about.

The Infant Soul Demon Sword that reached two thousand meters in length was actually shattered.

As for the Ancient Era’s War Sword, it was completely unscathed.

Seeing this scene, Ying Mingchao was unable to contain himself from shouting “Great job!” He was so excited that he was even tightly clenching his fists.

It was not only him, all the people in the allied army were overjoyed.

At the same time, they also started to have a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword.

Originally, they all felt that the Ancient Era’s War Sword would be inferior to the Infant Soul Demonic Sword judging by their auras.

However, when they collided, they realized that there was actually such an enormous disparity in power between the two swords.

The Ancient Era’s War Sword was the actual victor. At that moment, the Ancient Era’s War Sword was floating over ten thousand meters high in the sky. No matter how the dark black gaseous flames tried to attack it, it was unmoved in the slightest. The aura of a sovereign was completely revealed by it.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, the Ancient Era’s War Sword started to move. It was moving straight toward the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

Furthermore, the attack this time around was different from all of its previous attacks. Not only was the Ancient Era’s War Sword extremely fast, but the aura that it emitted was also extremely frightening. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

This time around, Chu Feng was no longer holding back. Instead, he had unleashed the true power of the Ancient Era’s War Sword. He was really planning to kill the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

“Damn it!”

Sensing that the situation was amiss, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster placed his hand toward his Cosmos Sack.

The next moment, his Incomplete Immortal Armament Dragonscale Dagger appeared in his hand.

Once he held the Incomplete Immortal Armament in hand, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s battle power immediately and greatly increased.

This was the power of an Incomplete Immortal Armament. With it in hand, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was like an existence on a completely different power level. He was simply unable to be discussed alongside his previous self.

“Heeaahh!!!”

Once he held the Dragonscale Dagger in hand, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster immediately slashed with it, and sent forth an enormous golden blade ray that swept across the sky.

“Clank!” The Ancient Era’s War Sword collided with the golden blade ray.

Merely, this time around, the Ancient Era’s War Sword was unable to advance like it did before. It was actually beaten back. It was beaten back by that golden blade ray.

Not only was it beaten back, but a huge chip also appeared on the body of the Ancient Era’s War Sword. That chip was precisely the location where the golden blade ray struck earlier.

“This...” Seeing this scene, the expressions of Ying Mingchao and the others changed enormously.

Deep worry emerged in their eyes. Judging from the situation at hand, it would appear that even Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword was unable to defeat the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster when he held an Incomplete Immortal Armament in hand.

“T-Truly despicable! D-Didn’t you say that y-you wouldn’t be using your I-Incomplete Immortal Armament? Y-Your a-actions are those of a s-sore loser!”

“Y-You damned t-trash, d-damned c-coward!!!”

Wang Qiang was unable to continue watching, and started to loudly curse at the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

“That’s right! So much for declaring how confident you were earlier, and stating that you would not use your Incomplete Immortal Armament! Turns out, you immediately used your Incomplete Immortal Armament the moment you started losing! You are despicable and shameless to the extreme!”

After Wang Qiang spoke, many others from the allied army also started to curse at the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

However, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster refused to accept those curses.

Proudly, he declared, “This Incomplete Immortal Armament is this Sectmaster’s possession. If I don’t want to use it, I won’t use it. When I want to use it, I’ll use it. What can you all possibly do about it?”

“So what if I went back on my words today? What can you all possibly do about it?”

“This world is one where might is right. All the rest are merely farts.”

“As for you all, regardless of how unjust you feel this is, regardless of how angry you might be, there’s nothing that you can do to me.”

“You all... can only wait to be slaughtered by me.”

“You!!!” Hearing those words, the crowd from the allied army all started to gnash their teeth in fury.

They were truly unable to tolerate how openly despicable and shameless the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was.

“Are you certain that you will be able to defeat me today?” Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s voice sounded.

Compared to the crowd from the allied army, Chu Feng did not reveal any anger. Instead, he was extremely calm.

Furthermore, he spoke with a very confident tone.
