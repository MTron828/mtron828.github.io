Chapter 3107 - The Ashamed Crowd

As that monster struggled, its oppressive might began to overflow.

Zhang Tianyi, Jiang Wushang and the others were all capable of sensing the power of that monster.

That monster’s true strength was most definitely not that of a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor. Instead, it was much superior to that of a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.

In fact, it was even stronger than that. That monster’s cultivation was at an unreachable level.

However, such a frightening monster was being held tightly by Chu Feng’s hand. It was simply unable to struggle free at all.

This caused the crowd to think about exactly what sort of cultivation Chu Feng currently possessed.

Upon thinking of that, Zhang Tianyi began to feel endlessly ashamed at what he had said to Chu Feng earlier.

He had thought that he had surpassed Chu Feng now that he had become a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor. However, he had no idea that Chu Feng’s cultivation had already reached a level that he could not even comprehend.

“You! You actually possess such power?! You, you’re not someone from here! Who exactly are you?!”

At that moment, the monster revealed an expression of panic on its face.

“Who I am is not important. What’s important is who you are. Answer me truthfully, or else you shall suffer,” Chu Feng said.

“Haha, it would appear that this King is truly unable to escape today. Consider it that this King was unfortunate. Brat, even if this King is to die here today, there will definitely be others within my clan that will avenge me.”

After that monster finished saying those words, a ‘bang’ was heard as it exploded again.

This time around, that monster had truly died.

Chu Feng had not expected that monster to possess such backbone, that he would rather kill himself than to reveal anything about his race to Chu Feng.

“Netherworld Royal Clan, what sort of race is that? Are they from the Ancient Era?” Chu Feng mumbled.

“Little brother Chu Feng, I knew that you wouldn’t abandon us.”

“Feng’er, I am truly sorry. Earlier, you told us that the volcano was strange. Yet, we ended up suspecting you. We are truly...”

Chu Feng’s relatives and friends once again surrounded Chu Feng. However, their faces were not only covered with joy, but were also covered with regret and shame.

How could they not be ashamed? They were either Chu Feng’s relatives or friends. Among them were also Chu Feng’s masters.

However, when Zhang Tianyi was driving Chu Feng out, none of them said anything.

They had to admit that they were selfish at that time. For their own power, they became selfish. They were so selfish that they were itching to give themselves two slaps to their faces just thinking back on it.

“Junior brother Chu Feng,” Right at that moment, another voice was heard.

It was Zhang Tianyi. When the crowd looked to Zhang Tianyi, they discovered that... he was kneeling on the ground.

“Junior brother Chu Feng, you came for us. Yet, I blamed you like that. I am unworthy of being a human, unworthy of being your senior brother.”

As Zhang Tianyi spoke, he raised his arm with the intention to slap himself.

However, before his moving palm could land on his cheek, his movement stopped.

It wasn’t Zhang Tianyi who stopped him. Instead, he was restricted.

It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had stopped him.

“Senior brother Zhang, there’s no need for this. Quickly, get up.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Chu Feng walked over to Zhang Tianyi’s side and helped him up.

“Junior brother Chu Feng, please hit me, beat me ruthlessly. If you are to beat me up, I will instead feel more at ease.”

“I was truly too much of a disgrace, too much of a bastard. Earlier, I actually said those sorts of words to you. I actually suspected my best brother. I am truly inhuman, truly deserving of death.”

After being helped up by Chu Feng, Zhang Tianyi became extremely emotional, and even more remorseful. He even started to cry tears of remorse.

A man like Zhang Tianyi was actually completely covered in tears.

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

Right at that moment, extremely resounding slapping sounds were heard.

It was Jiang Wushang. Without Chu Feng noticing it, Jiang Wushang had actually knelt on the ground and began to silently slap himself.

“Little brother Wushang, get up. What are you doing?”

Seeing that, Chu Feng hurriedly restricted Jiang Wushang’s movement and forcibly helped him up as well.

“Big brother Chu Feng. I... I’ve let you down, I’ve let you down.”

Like Zhang Tianyi, Jiang Wushang’s face was also covered in remorse. They were both extremely emotional, and crying nonstop.

“It’s not your fault, it really isn’t your fault at all. It was all caused by that monster.”

“Your wisdom was muddled by that monster,” Chu Feng comforted the crowd.

The crowd all understood the logic behind Chu Feng’s words. Jiang Wushang, Zhang Tianyi, Chu Guyu and the others all knew about it.

They all knew that their wisdom had been muddled. Otherwise, they would never do such a thing.

However, they’d already done it. Furthermore, they’d done it to Chu Feng, the person they loved the most.

Even though what they’d done was not something that they wanted to do, they still blamed themselves greatly for their actions.

“Everyone, you are all my close friends and relatives. In my eyes, you all are my family.”

“What use is there in fighting amongst one’s family? Furthermore, it was merely a minor verbal argument.”

“Thus, father, masters, seniors, brothers and sisters, let’s all forget about this matter and not think about it again.”

“What we need to make certain of right now is exactly what that monster’s origin is. The reason for that is because that monster... was extremely dangerous,” Chu Feng said to the crowd.

Chu Feng truly that monster to be too dangerous.

Through what that monster said earlier, Chu Feng had a rough understanding of that monster’s capabilities.

That monster absorbed the crowd’s friendly tendencies to awaken itself.

However, the most frightening aspect regarding it was actually its power that it released before it awakened. Its power contained martial comprehension, and could allow cultivators to increase their cultivation quickly.

However, all those that used its power to train would be controlled by the monster. When that monster released some sort of power, people would no longer be able to control themselves.

Furthermore, the cultivations that people obtained from training with the power released by that monster would be forcibly absorbed by that monster.

Earlier, Chu Feng had managed to prevent the monster from getting his way. Otherwise, Zhang Tianyi and the others would have all had their cultivations absorbed by that monster.

That monster had said that Zhang Tianyi and the others were fools. If the power released by that monster was not discovered by Zhang Tianyi and the others, but was instead discovered by the the cultivators of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and ended up being used by them to train, the final outcome would be extremely frightening.

That was the reason why Chu Feng deduced that that monster that emitted the Ancient Era’s aura and proclaimed itself to be from the Netherworld Royal Clan was extremely dangerous.
