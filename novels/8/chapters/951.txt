MGA: Chapter 952 - A Spectacle about to Arrive

“The second piece of information isn’t really a secret anymore. I’m sure it will be known in every corner in the Eastern Sea Region soon.

“In a few days, there will be an enormous wedding hosted in the Misty Peak. The bride will be Chu Feng’s fiancée, Zi Ling,” Qiushui Fuyan said.

“Murong Xun is pushing the marriage day forward?” Chu Feng pupils shrank. He tightly clenched his fists; it was clear he was a bit disturbed. To him, Zi Ling was really too important.

“No, this isn’t a marriage between Murong Xun and Zi Ling.” However, Qiushui Fuyan shook her head.

“Then who?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s Zi Ling and Jiang Qisha’s,” Qiushui Fuyan said.

“What? Jiang Qisha?” Chu Feng couldn’t help feeling shocked. Though, upon another thought, it was not all that surprising.

Zi Ling’s beauty was stunning, and she was a Divine Body. Jiang Qisha lusted for her beauty; that was somewhat understandable. However, Tantai Xue had clearly threatened Jiang Qisha to not do anything to Zi Ling and the others.

Yet, right now, Jiang Qisha was publicly flaunting his marriage with Zi Ling, which was quite crazy. It didn’t make much sense either, because this was simply challenging Tantai Xue.

“It’s a trap?” Chu Feng calmly said after some thought.

“You’ll know whether it’s a trap or not when you see this for yourselves.” As Qiushui Fuyan spoke, she handed out several invitation cards.

They were Jiang Qisha’s invitation cards sent to various forces in the Eastern Sea Region. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After opening it, Chu Feng wrinkled his brows even more. The content on the card truly made one livid.

Jiang Qisha had not only publicly announced he was the disciple of the Holy Land of Martialism’s Cursed Soil Sect, he even announced the reason for Zi Ling’s limited aptitude—it was because of the special poison in her body, the Heaven Gripping Pellet.

He even clearly stated on the invitation card that Zi Ling’s lover was Chu Feng, but due to his incompetence, he was unable to remove the pellet in Zi Ling’s body. His heart could not bear such a tragedy.

Thus Jiang Qisha decided to marry Zi Ling. Two years later, when the Heaven Gripping Pellet reached its most optimal state, he would take away her divine power, and have Zi Ling become an ordinary person.

“What a bastard.” You Mingdeng was furious after seeing that invitation card. He not only threw it away, he even shattered the desk in the palace.

“This Jiang Qisha brat has truly gotten tired of living.” As for Xue Xiyue, she too gritted her teeth from anger. She looked as if she wanted to skin Jiang Qisha alive.

After being together for a while, Qiu Canfeng had told them a few things about Chu Feng. So, they had a decent understanding regarding the relationship between Zi Ling and Chu Feng.

He was now the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, so Zi Ling was the wife of the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.

Yet now, Jiang Qisha publicly announced he would marry Zi Ling, and even stated clearly he was doing it for the divine power in her body. He truly went quite far. How could they even endure such a thing?

“It seems that this is most definitely a trap.” In contrast to You Mingdeng, Chu Feng appeared rather serene.

“But even if he’s luring you, he doesn’t need to do all this, right?” said Xue Xiyue furiously.

“No, he’s not luring me. In his heart, I’m not an obstruction in any way. He simply doesn’t need to go through so much trouble just for me.” Chu Feng shook his head.

“Then who is he luring?” All of them were confused.

“A person like Jiang Qisha, who also comes from the Holy Land of Martialism,” Chu Feng said.

“You mean it’s for Tantai Xue?” Qiushui Fuyan asked.

“Mm. I can feel that Jiang Qisha is still quite afraid of Tantai Xue. He fears she’ll harm Kuang Bainian, and the only reason he is doing this is to force her to appear,” Chu Feng said.

“Do you think she will?” Qiushui Fuyan asked.

“I’m not sure. Tantai Xue had said she would deal with Jiang Qisha, but she also said she would come and find me if that were the case. However, up until now, she has yet to contact me.

“I’m sure she will appear sooner or later. However, that will only be when she feels the time is ripe. Since she hasn’t come in contact with me, it means she isn’t absolutely confident she can defeat Jiang Qisha.

“So, this is a bit troubling.

“Although she promised to help us, there’s no friendship or anything between us. She is no fool, so she wouldn’t risk her life just for us.

“Similarly, the reason Jiang Qisha is doing this is because he’s afraid of his junior’s safety. Therefore, even if Tantai Xue doesn’t appear, he wouldn’t harm Zi Ling and the others. As for now, they are safe,” Chu Feng said after some analyzing.

“Then what should we do? Will we just do nothing and wait here?” Xue Xiyue said bitterly.

“No. No matter who Jiang Qisha is luring, Zi Ling is still my lover. I will not allow her to marry any other person.” Chu Feng shook his head.

“Sect Head, do you mean?” Fu Liansheng also spoke. At the same time, everyone’s gazes were focused on Chu Feng.

“On the day of marriage, capture the bride, and carry out murder!” Chu Feng said calmly.

“Haha, good! Then it’s decided! If we don’t show him a few things, they would truly think they can bully the Crippling Night Demon Sect anytime!” Xue Xiyue and the others were all joyed.

Simultaneously, a hint of extreme chilliness emerged into Chu Feng’s eyes.

Although he appeared very calm after knowing Jiang Qisha was going to marry Zi Ling, it did not mean he was not angry.

In reality, it was the complete opposite. Chu Feng already hated every single fibre of Jiang Qisha’s being. Jiang Qisha dared to even think of marrying Zi Ling—that was a capital offense. Chu Feng was going to kill him.

After confirmation of the plan, they executed it immediately. On that day, Chu Feng personally led the Crippling Night Demon Sect away from the Depraved Ravine. They headed towards the current headquarters of the Immortal Execution Archipelago—towards the Misty Peak.

They could not use the Teleportation Arrays to arrive at the Misty Peak directly. So, they had to leave at an earlier date. They had to take a longer path and sneak into the Misty Peak. Then, on the day of the marriage, when all forces of the Eastern Sea Region were present, they would give the Immortal Execution Archipelago and Jiang Qisha a surprise.

Actually, ever since the Immortal Execution Archipelago took down the Misty Peak and made it into their headquarters, that news had already shocked the entire Eastern Sea Region.

And right now, when Jiang Qisha spread the news that he came from the Holy Land of Martialism and was even going to marry Zi Ling, that shocked everyone even more.

Who was Zi Ling? Divine Body? Chu Feng’s lover? No, that was not all. Everyone knew Zi Ling was still Murong Xun’s fiancée. She was someone who had an arranged marriage with him.

Yet now, Jiang Qisha announced he would marry Murong Xun’s fiancée, in the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s territory! That was simply a slap in public.

However, the Immortal Execution Archipelago was hosting everything. Even the invitation cards sent to various forces were sent by the Immortal Execution Archipelago. That introduced a problem.

It meant the Immortal Execution Archipelago was now serving Jiang Qisha, or they were serving the force Jiang Qisha came from, the Cursed Soil Sect.

But no matter what, it would be a spectacle one should not miss.

With that thought in mind, sects from various places in the Eastern Sea Region hurried to the Misty Peak. Not to mention the ones who already received invitation cards, even those who hadn’t went forth to join in the liveliness.
