Chapter 4762: Xia Yan Comes Out of Closed-door Training

Chu Feng was just a step away from reaching Martial Exalted level. With the means he had at his disposal, he could be said to be invincible amongst all those beneath Martial Exalted level.

And it had only been a few days since he entered the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

He was able to raise his cultivation from rank six Utmost Exalted level to rank nine within such a short period of time, and naturally, it felt him overjoyed.

Martial Exalted level had looked so far away from him in the past, but it was finally within reach now.

But of course, he had no intention of going around bragging about this. He was waiting for the moment that the Vicious Beast Hellworld opened up and everyone was released before spreading the matter around.

Compared to breaking Lord Dugu Lingtian’s record, this matter could stir an even larger commotion. After all, this was a feat that even Lord Dugu Lingtian was unable to achieve.

As the chief elder and the others were in a horrible mood from worrying about Chu Feng, the celebratory banquet didn’t last for too long.

Chu Feng returned to his residence, only to find a crowd knocking on his door. This crowd consisted not just of disciples and elders from the North Tortoise Hall but some disciples from the South Vermilion Hall too.

And at the very center of this crowd stood Xia Ran.

“Junior Chu Feng, you’re finally back.”

Xia Ran didn’t lose his temper right after seeing Chu Feng. On the contrary, he revealed a delighted smile instead. Those who didn’t know better would have thought that the two of them were on good terms with one another.

This sight left everyone feeling astonished. They thought that Xia Ran was here to cause Chu Feng trouble, but his attitude was more than amicable.

However, Chu Feng simply sneered off his fawning, saying, “Xia Ran, what are you playing at this time around?”

“Junior Chu Feng, I know that I’ve done wrong this time around. I have no other intention in mind but to apologize to you. I have come with my utmost sincerity, so I hope that you get let bygones be bygones too.”

Xia Ran glanced at the six disciples behind him, who quickly stepped forward and took out a chest each from their Cosmos Sacks.

All six chests looked identical, but they contained different treasures ranging from rare medicinal herbs, martial cultivation resources, spirit power cultivation resources, ores, and so on.

There were even three top-grade Incomplete Exalted Armament too.

“Junior Chu Feng, this is a token of my sincerity. Please accept them,” Xia Ran said.

“I’ve received your sincerity, so you can take your items and leave now,” Chu Feng said with a wave of his hand.

The stuff that Xia Ran had brought out was indeed worth quite a bit, but there was nothing that Chu Feng really needed in there.

“Junior Chu Feng, please wait a moment. There’s a matter which I need to talk to you about. Is it convenient… if we enter your residence to talk?” Xia Ran asked.

“What is it? You can just speak here,” Chu Feng said.

“Junior Chu Feng, let’s talk inside instead. It’s not convenient here,” Xia Ran replied.

“Oh? Very well, give me a moment.”

Chu Feng first stepped into his residence, and it was a moment later before he finally opened his door.

“Come in,” Chu Feng said with a beckon of his hand, indicating for them to come in.

Seeing this, Xia Ran and his subordinates walked in without any hesitation. However, just a short moment later, a loud ‘peng’ sound echoed, and the door to Chu Feng’s residence suddenly blasted open.

Following that, the six disciples from the South Vermilion Hall scrambled out of the residence, shouting in a fluster.

“Save us, save us! Hurry up and get an elder here!”

“Chu Feng is out of his mind! He’s trying to kill Senior Xia Ran!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The spectating elders and disciples immediately rushed in to take a look, only to see Xia Ran lying feebly on the ground, bleeding profusely from his mouth, nose, and ears.

Xia Ran was indeed severely injured.

What was even eerier was that Chu Feng didn’t look discomposed at the least. Instead, he burst into laughter.

“Xia Ran, I knew that you had ulterior motives for coming here. Just as I’ve expected, you’re indeed up to no good! However, I must admit that I didn’t expect that someone like you would go to the extent of harming yourself so as to do me in. What a tenacious cockroach you are,” Chu Feng sneered scornfully.

“Chu Feng, I came here to apologize to you, but you snubbed off my kind intentions and assaulted me even! I must have been blind to think of reconciling with someone like you!”

However, Xia Ran feigned ignorance of Chu Feng’s words as he yelled out in anger and indignance. It looked almost as if someone had really wronged him here.

The surrounding crowd didn’t witness the sight in person, so they couldn’t tell who was right and who was wrong here. However, one thing they did know was that Chu Feng was in deep trouble now.

“Where is Xia Ran? Who has seen Xia Ran?”

A voice suddenly echoed from the distance at the moment, and it was growing louder by the moment.

“That voice… Can it possibly be…”

The elders and disciples immediately revealed nervous looks upon hearing that voice. Despite having not seen the person yet, they could already recognize her by her voice.

Soon, a beautiful female disciple dressed in the robes of the South Vermilion Hall appeared by the horizon of the sky, searching her surroundings intently. As she traveled through the area, she kept shouting Xia Ran’s name.

This female disciple had an appearance and disposition that few in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect could hope to compete with, such that she seemed to make any scenery come to life.

However, compared to her appearance, her name was far more well-known. On top of being the granddaughter of Hidden Dragon Elder Lord Xia Zhicheng and the chief of the Law Enforcement Hall, she was also the fourth rank Hidden Dragon Disciple, Xia Yan.

She was the reason why Xia Ran dared to act so arrogantly.

“It’s all over. Xia Yan actually came out of her closed-door training.”

“It’s all over. Chu Feng is doomed.”

“She’s definitely here to exact vengeance for Xia Ran.”

Everyone who saw Xia Yan was convinced that Chu Feng was done for. There was no one in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect who didn’t know of just how much Xia Yan doted on Xia Ran.

“Big sis, you have to redress my grievances!”

A person suddenly rushed through the crowd to run over to where Xia Yan was. He grabbed onto Xia Yan’s legs and began crying pitifully.

Had it been anyone else, Xia Yan would have surely sent them flying with her kick. However, she didn’t get angry at this person instead, and everyone didn’t think that there was anything weird with it either.

This person was no other than the little brother Xia Yan doted on, Xia Ran.

“Xia Ran, how did you end up in such a state? Who’s the one who did it?!”

Xia Yan was horrified to see Xia Ran’s current state, and her face began warping in anger.

“It’s Chu Feng, the North Tortoise Hall’s Chu Feng!” Xia Ran cried out.

“Chu Feng? Which Chu Feng? Does he not know that you’re the younger brother I’ve acknowledged? How dare he make a move on you!” Xia Yan bellowed as a glint flashed across her eyes.

She was still resting after having just come out of her closed-door training when she suddenly received a letter from Xia Ran telling her to come over to the North Tortoise Hall. So, she came here not knowing anything about the affairs between Chu Feng and Xia Ran.

But regardless of who Chu Feng was, Xia Yan wasn’t planning on letting the culprit who dared to make Xia Ran suffer off the hook.
