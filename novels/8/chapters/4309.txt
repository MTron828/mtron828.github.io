Chapter 4309 - The Structure Of The Martial Cultivation World

Chu Feng was having very complicated thoughts.

Even though it has been many years since his encounter with Little Fishy, he could tell from what Xianhai Shaoyu told him that it seemed like he really does possess a special status in Little Fishy’s heart.

But, that was something that Chu Feng never anticipated for. Because of that, he was momentarily incapable of accepting it.

He never imagined that their short interaction would leave behind such a huge impression on that child Little Fishy.

“Originally, I should be accompanying my little sister to take a look at you.”

“But, my little sister was too mischievous back then. When she ran to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, she gave my father a great scare. Because of that, ever since that day, a restriction talisman was placed on her. She was no longer allowed to leave the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.”

“As such, she’s trapped in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan and unable to come out,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Brother Shaoyu, the little girl in the Heaven-devouring Beast Realm with the same name as your little sister was something that you all had deliberately arranged to test me with, right?” asked Chu Feng.

He had felt things to be too much of a coincidence back then. Thinking about it now, everything made sense now.

“Brother Chu Feng, you must not blame me for that.”

“At that time, I don’t know what sort of person you are. But, my sister had praised you to great heights.”

“If I didn’t use some tricks, how would I know if my sister was having an unrequited love or if she was scammed by you?”

“But, after I’ve interacted with you, I’ve realized why my little sister fancied you.”

“Brother Chu Feng, there’s definitely nothing bad that can be said about your moral character. Not to mention my little sister, even I took you to my fancy,” Xianhai Shaoyu cast a flirtatious glance at Chu Feng as he said those words.

Seeing that flirtatious glance, Chu Feng’s face turned green and goose bumps filled his body.

That said, the words spoken by Xianhai Shaoyu had indirectly verified Chu Feng’s suspicion of Xianhai Shaoyu testing him to be true.

“Back then, an abnormal sign had appeared on the Eastern Sea Region.”

“It was a pair of giant hands. They emerged from the depths of the highest heavens and tore apart an enormous gap in the sky.”

“Thinking back to that abnormal sign now, it should be caused by either your father or some other expert within your clan, no?”

“They’ve entered the Eastern Sea Region using that method after finding your younger sister.”

“But, as they were too powerful, no one in the Eastern Sea Region detected them,” said Chu Feng.

The abnormal sign that appeared in the Eastern Sea Region just so happened right before Little Fishy left.

That abnormal sign left behind an enormous impact in Chu Feng’s heart.

It could be said that the abnormal sign was the first thing to make Chu Feng realize how small and weak he was.

At that time, he witnessed the power on par with gods.

“It is most likely something my father did,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“In that case, your Immortal Sea Fish Clan is most certainly a very powerful clan,” said Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’ve really never heard of our Immortal Sea Fish Clan?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

“I’ve journeyed my way up here from the Lower Realms. As such, I possess limited knowledge. Brother Shaoyu, please don’t take offense to my ignorance,” said Chu Feng.

“That can’t be blamed on you. Likely, very few people in the entire Holy Light Galaxy knew of our Immortal Sea Fish Clan.”

“After all, you all from the Eastern Region could be said to be cut off from the rest of the world over the last years. You’ve not made any dealings with the outside world. Apart from top powers that had continued for many years, it is normal for others to not know about the situation of the outside world,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Eastern Region? Do you mean our Holy Light Galaxy?” asked Chu Feng.

“Mn,” Xianhai Shaoyu nodded.

“In that case, it would mean that the vast martial cultivation world is separated into different regions?” asked Chu Feng.

Not to mention a world, even a continent would be separated into different regions.

Take the Nine Provinces Continent for example. It was split into nine different provinces.

Hearing what Xianhai Shaoyu said, it seemed like the Holy Light Galaxy belonged to the Eastern Region. Furthermore, it seemed like there were other powers in the Eastern Region and other regions besides it.

Thus, it would appear to Chu Feng that this boundless martial cultivation world seemed to possess boundaries that split it to multiple different regions.

“That’s correct,” Xianhai Shaoyu nodded.

“Brother Shaoyu, is it possible for you to give me an account of the vast martial cultivation world so that I can gain some knowledge and experience?”

Chu Feng had always wanted to learn about the various powers in the vast martial cultivation world.

As Xianhai Shaoyu came from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, Chu Feng felt that he must be very knowledgeable. Because of that, Chu Feng wanted to learn more about the vast martial cultivation world from him.

“Of course. Those are things that you’ll come to know sooner or later anyways.”

“The vast martial cultivation world is separated into the Eastern Region, Western Region, Northern Region and Southern Region.”

“There existed two galaxies in the Eastern Region. They are respectively the Nine Souls Galaxy and your Holy Light Galaxy.”

“The Western Region also possesses two galaxies. They’re the Heavenly Dome Galaxy and the Bloodline Galaxy.”

“In the Eastern Region, the power that ruled over your Holy Light Galaxy is the Holy Light Clan. As for the one that ruled over the Nine Souls Galaxy, it’s the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.”

“As for the Western Region, the one to rule over the Heavenly Dome Galaxy is the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.”

“As for the Western Region’s Bloodline Galaxy...”

Xianhai Shaoyu stopped speaking after saying those words. With a complicated expression, he looked to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng felt that something was amiss from the way Xianhai Shaoyu was looking at him.

Thus, he asked, “Brother Shaoyu, what’s wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?”

“Brother Chu Feng, earlier, you and I endured the power of that black case together. After that, you fell unconscious.”

“Did you remember anything during the time that you were unconscious?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Anything? Could it be that something happened while I was unconscious?” asked Chu Feng.

Hearing Chu Feng ask such a question, Xianhai Shaoyu knew that Chu Feng does not remember anything.

“That’s right. We were attacked,” said Xianhai Shaoyu. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Attacked? Who attacked us?” asked Chu Feng.

“The Demon Morph Clan.”

Then, Xianhai Shaoyu informed Chu Feng what happened.

He not only informed Chu Feng the Demon Morph Clan’s desire to plunder the power that increased their bloodlines, he also informed Chu Feng of how his bloodline went berserk and killed the Demon Morph Clansmen.

“Brother Shaoyu, you mean to say that I’ve killed your fourth uncle and the other experts of the Demon Morph Clan?”

Chu Feng was very surprised after learning this matter. He felt very shocked. After all, he believed that he simply would not possess that sort of power.

“That’s right. After all, your bloodline’s powers belong to you.”

“Brother Chu Feng, you were able to cause your bloodline to enter a berserk state. Your bloodline’s strength could be said to be unparalleled in the current martial cultivation world,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Is having one’s bloodline run berserk really that powerful of a thing?”

As he does not possess any memory of the time when he was unconscious, Chu Feng had no idea how powerful his bloodline running berserk was.

But, Chu Feng felt that Xianhai Shaoyu was not lying to him.

“You really had no recollection at all?”

“Brother Chu Feng, have you never experienced any similar situation to that?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

“If I must say, then when I was still a youngster, I had a similar experience.”

Chu Feng recalled the time in the Nine Provinces Continent.

At that time, Chu Feng, Zhang Tianyi and Zi Ling were on an expedition against a power called Sword God’s Valley.

Later on, because the Sword God’s Valley’s old ancestor injured Zi Ling, Chu Feng flew into a violent rage.

He did not remember anything that happened afterwards. He only learned of what happened from Zi Ling and Zhang Tianyi.

According to them, he released power that far surpassed what he possess and razed the entire Sword God’s Valley to the ground.
