Chapter 5579: Jie Tian Is Too Weak? Or Chu Feng Is Too Strong?

“Don’t spout nonsense, Eggy. Little Fishy is my little sister,” Chu Feng said.

“You treat her as a little sister, but does she only take you as her big brother? Can you bear to let down such a good girl? Can you bear to see her sad?” Eggy asked.

Chu Feng was fazed by those words. The last thing he wanted in the world was for Little Fishy to be sad because of him. Thus, he took a closer look at Little Fishy.

He had to admit that her beauty had reached a point where it didn’t pale in comparison to Eggy. There was no fault he could pick in their appearances, be it in terms of facial features, physique, or complexion. They were the best of the best. Even their voices were euphonious.

The biggest difference between them was their dispositions. Where Eggy was eccentric, Little Fishy was adorable. Of course, Eggy was also the more frightening one when angry.

Despite Little Fishy’s beauty, Chu Feng didn’t harbor any romantic feelings for her.

Love works in mysterious ways. It isn’t about how beautiful or outstanding a person is; it just comes as and when it likes. While he cared about Little Fishy, he didn’t think that he harbored any romantic feelings for her at the moment.

Of course, no one could speak about the future with certainty.

After Chu Feng confirmed that there was nothing amiss with Little Fishy, he turned his attention to Jie Tian.

“Hm?”

He had long noticed that Jie Tian was struggling with the talent assessment formation, but the latter’s condition seemed to be getting increasingly worse. Even though the talent assessment formation wasn’t as grand as Little Fishy’s formation, it was still a tough nut to crack.

Contained in the talent assessment formation was a world enveloped in divine, golden light. Its ground was flat and empty, devoid of any geographical features like streams and mountains. There wasn’t even the slightest speck of dust to be seen.

There was only a flight of stairs in the very center of the world. All in all, the stairs had a total of a hundred steps. At the very top was a bundle of light containing a key. This key looked similar to the one Chu Feng had obtained, but there were subtle differences.

Jie Tian had managed to reach the ninetieth step, but he was completely drenched in sweat and gasping for breath. It looked like he was close to reaching his limit.

“Is his talent so weak as to struggle on the ninetieth step?” Eggy asked.

“He should be extremely talented given how skillfully he channels his spirit power. Is the talent assessment formation that difficult?” Chu Feng wondered.

Soon, Little Fishy’s bloodline formation settled down. She had survived the formation’s attack, and the surges of energy inside the realm converged into a key that fell right into her hands. Following that, the bloodline formation dissipated.

Little Fishy excitedly rushed out of the bloodline formation with the key and danced with joy, looking like a child who had just obtained her beloved toy. She looked adorable.

Chu Feng was suddenly reminded of the little girl he had met in the Eastern Sea Region, but he quickly snapped out of his daze. What awakened him wasn’t Little Fishy’s sweet smile but the fact that there wasn’t even a single bead of sweat to be seen on her face.

This was peculiar, considering how powerful the bloodline formation was.

“That girl sure is terrifying.”

Chu Feng couldn’t help but wonder if he could have cleared that bloodline formation as easily as Little Fishy did. While he was confident in his abilities, he wasn’t sure if he could match her feat.

“That fellow seems to be struggling,” Little Fishy remarked as she looked at Jie Tian.

“He’s indeed struggling,” Chu Feng agreed.

Kacha!

Cracks suddenly appeared from the foot of the stairs and started creeping upward. At this rate, the stairs would surely collapse once the cracks enveloped the entire flight of stairs.

“There’s a time limit!” Chu Feng remarked with a frown.

He knew that the cracks were a reminder to the challenger that they were running short on time.

“Big brother, will we lose the key if Jie Tian fails to obtain it before time’s up?” Little Fishy asked.

She was certain that was the case, but she was inclined to defer to Chu Feng’s judgment.

“Yes,” Chu Feng replied confidently.

“Big brother, shall I join him?” Little Fishy asked.

“I’ll go. You need to rest after having just breached the bloodline formation.”

“It’s the same for you too. Don’t you need to rest as well?”

“I have already rested up,” Chu Feng replied with a smile before entering the formation.

He quickly flitted toward the stairs and started climbing it. As soon as he stepped onto the first step, he felt pressure weighing on his shoulders.

“How is it?” Eggy asked.

“Doesn’t feel like anything,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ah? Is Jie Tian that weak?” Eggy asked.

“Let’s see how difficult it gets later on,” Chu Feng replied as he quickly scaled the steps.

The first step, the second step, the third step… Chu Feng reached the eightieth step within the blink of an eye, putting him rather close to Jie Tian. His footsteps remained stable even though he had slowed down considerably. Soon, he reached the ninetieth step, where Jie Tian was at.

The steps from this point onward weren’t just ordinary steps—each of them spanned a wide area reminiscent of a town square. Even though Jie Tian and Chu Feng were on the same step, they were still a distance away from each other.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng could see Jie Tian standing right in front of the 91st step, trying to scale it with his trembling leg. But as soon as he put his leg up, his body suddenly convulsed as if it was put under immense pressure, forcing him to quickly retract his leg.

This simple step looked like a hurdle too tall for Jie Tian to overcome. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“That fellow is truly weak,” Eggy commented with certainty.

Chu Feng quickly walked up to Jie Tian and asked, “You can’t even make this step up?”

Jie Tian was so exhausted that he didn’t even notice Chu Feng’s approach. It was only upon hearing the latter’s words that he hurriedly turned his head over. His eyes widened in surprise upon seeing Chu Feng.

“What are you doing here? Get lost! You’ll only bother me here,” Jie Tian said.

“Bother you? I reckon we’ll lose this key if we leave this formation up to you,” Chu Feng said before making his way up the step.

Jie Tian was angered by Chu Feng’s reluctance to listen to him, but when Chu Feng walked past him, scaled the 91st step, and advanced with ease, he froze in place. His mouth was still open, but he couldn’t find any words to say anymore.

His eyes slowly widened to the brim.

“Why? Why would it be like that?”

Jie Tian couldn’t understand why Chu Feng could scale the steps so easily when he faced so much trouble with them.
