Chapter 5458: Secret Art: Dark Plunder

“It’s nothing much. I have been wanting to leave the Totem Dragon Clan for some time now. As a matter of fact, my aunt and I have been estranged from the Totem Dragon Clan for some time now,” Long Muxi said.

Chu Feng could tell that Long Muxi wasn’t revealing the truth, but he chose not to probe any deeper since it might be a difficult topic for her.

“I swore to never use the power of the Totem Dragon Clan’s bloodline power, but I can’t stop cultivating because of that. Thus, I cultivated a forbidden mystic skill to raise my fighting prowess. But no matter how I cultivate the forbidden mystic skill, it remains nowhere close to matching my bloodline.

“To be honest with you, I could have defeated Zhou Dong back then in the Ancient Realm if I had used my bloodline power, but my obstinacy forced you to resort to a forbidden skill, and you nearly died as a result of that. I’m truly sorry about that.” Long Muxi hung her head in shame.

“No wonder!” Eggy remarked.

She had noticed that Long Muxi was using a forbidden mystic skill, and she thought that it was weird why Long Muxi wasn’t using her bloodline power instead. Forbidden mystic skills were developed for those without strong bloodline powers, but someone who was as talented as Long Muxi was bound to have a powerful bloodline.

It all finally made sense.

“Miss Muxi, you shouldn’t blame yourself too much. It’s not the first time I have suffered a backlash. I’m already used to it,” Chu Feng consoled with a smile.

He didn’t want Long Muxi to blame herself for this.

“It’s not just that. When the Bluemoon Palace attacked, my aunt and I left without bringing you with us. I am truly…”

Before Long Muxi could finish her sentence, Chu Feng interjected, “Miss Muxi, I know that you have your own difficulties. Zhou Dong was determined to get me. Neither you nor your aunt could have helped me back then. You shouldn’t blame yourself for something you aren’t able to do anything about. Besides, aren’t I standing healthily before you right now?”

Long Muxi slowly nodded in response, but her face remained conscience-stricken.

“Is this the reason you are helping me deal with Jia Lingyi?” Chu Feng asked.

“This was the only way I could think of to repay you. I hope that you don’t mind it,” Long Muxi said.

“Why would I mind it? The fact that you’re willing to go this far for me shows that you see me as a friend,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

He knew that Long Muxi was the kind of person who didn’t easily open her heart to others, but when she did, she would be willing to put her life on the line for her friends. Needless to say, he was more than happy to make a friend like her.

It didn’t take long for the World Spiritist Painter to fully activate the secret art formation.

Chu Feng stepped into the formation and was immediately impressed by its effectiveness. Without any hesitation, he took out the monster whom he was going to fuse with the Dao of Absolute Darkness.

The monster had been reduced to a bundle of black aura, not displaying any of its earlier might. Just like the World Spiritist Painter had said, the monster would naturally dissipate from the face of the world. If not for the Dao of Absolute Darkness, it would have already disappeared by now.

Fortunately, the monster still retained its unique energy despite having lost its intimidating air, so it could still be used as the medium for the secret skill.

In truth, Chu Feng could have forged the secret skill without relying on this formation too, but he thought that it would be best to get all the help he could, even if it turned out to be unnecessary in the end.

This was his first time forging a secret skill, but thanks to his strong cultivation foundation and precise control of spirit power, his movements were as smooth as those of a veteran. It was no easy feat to fuse the two great powers together, but he was able to pull it off with ease.

Once the secret skill was completed, he fused it into his body.

The formation around him seemed to have sensed his success and stopped functioning shortly after.

Noticing how the surroundings had quietened down, Eggy asked, “Chu Feng, are you done?”

“Yes, I have succeeded,” Chu Feng replied.

“How is the secret skill you forged using the Dao of Absolute Darkness and that monster?” Eggy asked expectantly.

The monster was such a terrifying existence that not even Long Kuitian and Long Suqing were able to do anything about it, and the Dao of Absolute Darkness was a power that the powerful woman who called herself an emperor was unable to grasp. It was hard to imagine that a secret skill forged out of those two would be anything but powerful.

“How should I put this? It’ll disappoint you in terms of raw power, but it has a unique ability that compensates for that,” Chu Feng replied with an excited voice that hinted at his satisfaction with the outcome.

“Stop beating around the bush and show it to me!” Eggy exclaimed.

“All right, I’ll show it to you then.”

Chu Feng raised his hand, and a black aura quickly gushed out and instantaneously enveloped an area of ten meters radius around him. It was neither impressive in terms of its reach or might. However, Eggy sensed something peculiar the moment the black aura appeared. She couldn’t clearly put her finger on it, but she could sense something special about Chu Feng’s secret skill.

“Chu Feng, what’s the effect of your secret skill? It doesn’t look very impressive,” Eggy said.

“Well, I can’t reveal its true prowess without an opponent, but I have come up with a name for it. Dark Plunder,” Chu Feng replied gleefully.

“Dark Plunder?” Eggy fell into deep thought.

“Milady Queen, why don’t you guess what’s its effect based on its name?”

“Since you named it Dark Plunder, I’m guessing that it steals something. Treasures?”

“You have the rough idea down, but you need to elaborate on what kind of treasure it is.”

“What kind of treasures? Treasures inside the Cosmos Sack? Or treasures that are embedded into a cultivator’s body?”

“No, that’s not it. The treasures I can plunder are treasures that require cultivation,” Chu Feng replied.

“What kind of treasures require cultivation?” Eggy was confused.

“All right, I shan’t beat around the bush anymore. I can plunder martial skills, secret skills, and those sorts of things. However, they have to be executed in front of me first,” Chu Feng said.

“That sounds rather interesting… but is that all?”

While Eggy was able to see the potential behind such a secret skill, it didn’t live up to her expectations, considering the background of the Dao of Absolute Darkness.

“Of course not. Martial skills and secret skills I have plundered are permanently mine, and they’ll be temporarily enhanced for a short period right after I plunder them over,” Chu Feng replied. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“That’s pretty interesting. Will you be able to enhance those skills on your own accord in the future too, or are the enhancements only limited to the short duration right after you plundered the skills?” Eggy asked.

“That’s hard to say. My cultivation is still too weak to uncover the full prowess of the secret skill. I’ll still have to further develop it. However, the area of effect and the plunder effectiveness will improve along with the growth of my cultivation.”

“That’s good to hear.”

“There’s one last thing. I left the best for the last.”

“What is it? Just spill it all out. Stop keeping me in suspense!” Eggy exclaimed.

“I can plunder world spirits too,” Chu Feng said.
