Chapter 5826: Why Juniors?

Chapter 5826: Why Juniors?

“Oh?” Xianhai Shaoyu fell into deep thoughts after hearing those words.

“Is it another power from the Ancient Era?” Little Fishy was curious.

The two siblings initially didn’t think much about those cloaked figures they met outside, and it was only after hearing Chu Feng’s words that they realized they were no simple figures. They knew how keen Chu Feng’s eyes were, after all.

“Are you familiar with the present Ancient Era’s powers?” Chu Feng asked.

“Most Ancient Era’s powers either dwell underground or live in some special remnants, so our understanding of them is limited. If not for the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, I wouldn’t have known there was a Huangfu Heavenly Clan. Judging by their juniors’ strength, the Huangfu Heavenly Clan is likely to be a formidable force.

“I’m worried that there might be a power from the Ancient Era that’s stronger than the Huangfu Heavenly Clan. If more of them are liberated from their restraints, the power structure of the world of cultivation could change,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Little Fishy fell silent. It was the first time Chu Feng saw such a grim expression on her face. She was an Immortal Sea Fish Clansman, after all. She must be worried about the fate of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. If the powers of the Ancient Era wanted to grasp power, their first target would be the galaxy overlords.

“Forget it. We’ll deal with it as it comes along.” Xianhai Shaoyu noticed Little Fishy's worry and said with a smile, “Little sister, don’t worry about it. Your two big brothers will protect you.”

Little Fishy burst into laughter. “Stop bragging, big brother. We still don’t know who will be protecting who, though big brother Chu Feng is much more reliable than you.”

“You never know,” Xianhai Shaoyu said. He turned to Chu Feng and said, “Brother Chu Feng, you mustn’t let your guard down. I might just overtake you at any time.”

Chu Feng chuckled.

The auction soon began.

It was truly a high-class auction, as the very first item was already a valuable treasure from the Ancient Era. The subsequent items only got even pricier. It spurred people from different powers to compete for them, making for quite a bustling atmosphere.

However, there was nothing that piqued Chu Feng, Xianhai Shaoyu, and Little Fishy’s interest.

A God Armament even appeared on the auction later on, but it was slightly damaged. That would affect the prowess of the God Armament, but it was still sold for ten million sycees.

In comparison, a normal Exalted Armament could only be exchanged for a sycee, which meant that a damaged God Armament was worth ten million Exalted Armaments. This was how much God Armaments were worth.

“Big brother, how much are God Armaments worth?” Little Fishy asked.

“At a minimum, forty million million sycees. The higher quality ones can fetch fifty million.”

Chu Feng thought of the last time he had attempted to trade a God Armament for sycees. Manager Ma had offered him fifty million sycees straight. That showed that Xianhai Shaoyu was not lying, and he did know his stuff.

“Are our God Armaments worth that much?” Little Fishy remarked.

She didn’t know much about the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild, and she had never exchanged anything for sycees here before, but she had sold a couple of things before, so she had a rough idea about the sycee’s buying power.

“Ey! My little sister, God Armaments aren’t that cheap. In particular, those that display the word ‘True’ when tamed are priceless treasures,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Priceless, in the sense that it’s worthless or that it’s worth too much?” Little Fishy asked.

“Of course it’s the latter! It’s worth at least ten times more than ordinary God Armaments!” Xianhai Shaoyu exclaimed.

“Ten times more?! That’s a lot!” Little Fishy was stunned.

“A lot? You would be lucky if you could get one! You can’t buy one even with money. Many of our treasures are also worth astronomical sums. That’s why you shouldn’t blame our father when he sends someone to protect you. You might be skinny, but you are as good as a moving gold mountain. You don’t know how many people are after you,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“I know, but I don’t like people following me. I like freedom,” Little Fishy said.

It was then that an item was pushed onto the auction stage. Chu Feng’s eyes lit up.

It was a watermelon-sized transparent sphere that emanated an old aura. It contained a space that was as big as a small realm, and there was a powerful formation inside refining an item. The item was extremely small, around the size of a bean, but it emanated a brilliant glow reminiscent of the sun.

It was extremely eye-catching inside the formation realm.

“Big brother, what’s that?” Little Fishy asked.

“It should be a treasure that benefits world spiritists,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll give it to you if you fancy it.” Little Fishy noticed the change in Chu Feng’s gaze, which hinted at his interest in it.

“There’s no need for it. I’ll get it myself if I’m interested,” Chu Feng replied.

“I’ll give it to you,” Little Fishy insisted.

The beautiful elder in charge of the auction didn’t rush to the bidding phase. She walked up to the transparent sphere before casting her gaze at the distinguished compartments. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Those who are gathered here are distinguished individuals. I believe most of you are knowledgeable individuals who have seen lots of things in your time. However, do any of you know the name of this treasure?” the beautiful elder asked with a smile.

“Stop beating around the bush and reveal what it is,” an elder voice boomed. His words hinted at his interest in the item too.

A couple of people after him tried answering the question, but they were all wrong. No one present here knew the name of the transparent sphere.

“To think no one knows its name! No wonder it piqued so many people’s interest even though it was sold right after a God Armament!” Little Fishy exclaimed.

“It’s fine as long as those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion don’t get interested in it,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Why?” Little Fishy asked.

“They are rich. They rarely participate in the bidding, but if they do, they’ll go all out. They are the ones whom I’m the most worried about later when bidding for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip fragment,” Xianhai Shaoyu replied.

“Big brother, are you so certain they’ll be here?” Little Fishy asked.

“They will be here. They won’t turn a blind eye to a God Bestowment Bamboo Slip fragment,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

A few other people in the distinguished compartments offered more guesses.

However, the beautiful elder shook her head and said, “Since you don’t know this treasure well, allow me to change my question. Do you know which era this treasure is from, whether it’s the Ancient Era or the Immemorial Era, or whether it has restrictions placed on it?”
