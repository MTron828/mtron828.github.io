Chapter 5028: Black-robed Man

“So how is your prophecy going, little gypsy? Will our Nine Souls Galaxy survive this calamity you speak of?”

Quite a few people asked her about the conclusion when the woman finally opened her eyes. It was just that their tone was not one of curiosity but teasing.

No one believed her words at all, thinking that she was just a joke.

It was hard to tell whether the woman was too innocent to notice that they were making fun of her or not, but she didn’t lose her temper at their teasing. Instead, she revealed a heartened smile.

“There’s no need to worry. It turned out to be an empty scare. Someone will put a stop to the calamity that will soon befall our Nine Souls Galaxy, and the person is currently inside Lush Immortal City,” the woman said.

“Hoh! Your story is getting more outlandish. You said that the calamity will be resolved by a person in this city. Why don’t you point that person out for us then?”

The crowd began probing deeper into it.

“I’m afraid that’s beyond my means, but it’s a huge relief that the calamity will be resolved,” the woman replied with a smile.

Her expression revealed earnest joy and relief.

“Why don’t you tell us what kind of calamity is it, and how will it be resolved?” someone else asked.

“That’s also beyond my means to prophesy,” the woman replied.

“Shit! You might as well have said nothing at all, you damned charlatan!”

All of a sudden, someone hurled malicious words at the woman. Following that, a bearded man leaped over to the woman’s side and grabbed her collar, forcefully lifting her up from her chair.

“Speak, you scammer! What’s your motive for spreading such falsehoods here? Are you trying to dupe us of our money?”

The bearded man emanated the aura of a rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivator, which was fairly decent amongst those gathered in the vicinity.

“I’m not spreading falsehoods! I’m not trying to dupe you of your money!”

The woman shook her head nervously.

“Oh? Are you here to catch our attention here? Why don’t you take a look in the mirror? Even the ugliest servant in my house is much more beautiful than you. Know your own place!”

The bearded man started to publicly humiliate the woman, and his words induced laughter from the crowd.

That brought a frown to Chu Feng’s face. The ugliness of human nature had started to manifest here, and he particularly hated it when the strong exploited the weak.

“I’m really not lying to you. Everything I said are facts! I don’t have any ulterior motives. If anything, I only want to inform you all about it. Milord, I’m begging you. Please let me off!”

The woman’s complexion turned pale, and her voice began to quiver. That made her look extremely pitiful.

However, there was hardly anyone who had any sympathy for this woman. Only disdainful sneers were heard as they waited for the woman to be punished.

“Let you off? If you aren’t duping us of our wealth or attracting our attention, it can only mean that you’re trying to make a fool out of us. I can let you off, but why don’t you ask everyone else if they feel the same way?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The bearded man turned to the crowd.

“That woman dared to make a fool of us and waste our time. How can we let her off so easily? She needs to pay the price!”

“Yes, she needs to pay the price!”

The woman started tearing up out of sheer fright.

Much to everyone’s surprise, the tears flowing out of her white eye were white whereas the tears flowing out of her black eye were black.

“What’s with your tears? You’re a freak! Even your tears are different from that of an ordinary human. You don’t look like anything much, but I guess you at least have a pair of unusual eyes. I’ve played with countless women, but this is my first time seeing one like you.

“Why don’t I give you a chance to make amends? You should know that I’m sacrificing myself for your sake here. All you have to do is to serve me. If everyone feels that you’re sincere about making amends, we’ll let you go. What do the rest of you say?” the bearded man asked the crowd.

Some of the women below thought that the bearded man was being too shameless, so they turned around and left. Some of the men walked away too.

However, there was not a single person amongst the crowd who spoke up for the woman. Instead, most eyes started glowing in excitement. From the cheers, it was apparent that most people agreed with the bearded man’s proposal.

“To think that no one is interfering with such atrocities happening in broad daylight. It looks like Lush Immortal City is a lawless land,” Chu Feng remarked with a deep sigh.

He couldn’t stand these people bullying that woman, but he chose not to make a move because he wanted to see if anyone would intervene to stop the bearded man. After all, he reckoned that it would cause quite a huge commotion when he found the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect later on.

In truth, he was glad to see that no one was intervening. This meant that no one would cause a fuss even if he made a huge disturbance later on.

So, he turned to look at the bearded man with a vicious look in his eyes.

He wasn’t acquainted with the woman, so he couldn’t tell whether the woman’s prophecy was real or not. However, as a man, how could he watch a woman being taken advantage of in broad daylight?

“Let her go!”

But just as Chu Feng was about to make a move, a bellow suddenly echoed from the crowd.

The crowd immediately parted to reveal a man.

He was dressed in a black robe that was stitched together by many pieces of black cloth, and it extended to his head and palms. It would have been impossible to make out his gender if not for his masculine voice. The only thing that could be seen was his long black ponytail that fluttered outside.

“Hm? Someone actually dares to get in my way? Are you in a group with this woman? Do you know who I am?” the bearded man threatened fearlessly.

Pu!

With a dull thud, the bearded man was sent flying into the distance.

When the bearded man finally landed on the ground, the crowd was shocked to discover that there was a gaping hole in his body. When someone nervously walked forward to check on the body, he realized that the bearded man had breathed his last.

He was dead!

And the culprit was none other than the black-robed man.

The crowd plunged into silence. Terrified eyes gathered on the black-robed man.

They were shocked not by the black-robed man’s ability to kill the bearded man in a single strike but by the aura he had emanated that very instant.

The black-robed man was a rank five Martial Exalted level cultivator! That meant that he was easily the strongest junior of the entire Nine Souls Galaxy.

The crowd’s first reaction was to guess the background of this black-robed man, deducing whether he was a young master of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan or the closed-door disciple of some renowned expert.

Meanwhile, the black-robed man cast a sweeping gaze across the crowd.

“Listen well! None of you are to cause trouble for this lady anymore, or else I’ll take your life!”
