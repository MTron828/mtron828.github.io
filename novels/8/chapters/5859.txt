Chapter 5860: I’ll Slaughter Those From the Ancient Era and Present Era Alike

“You’re Chu Feng’s master? That would mean... you’re from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy too?” The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder glared at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Yes, but that’s not all. I’m also somewhat a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, though that was such a long time ago that it’s no longer important now. What’s more important is that Chu Feng is my only disciple... and you said earlier you’d kill everyone important to Chu Feng? Do you have the ability to do so?”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s face warped in savagery. The rate at which he absorbed the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder further hastened.

Under such torture, the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s grand elder let out cries of agony. However, his cries only lasted for a short while, as he quickly lost his life shortly after.

The death of their grand elder sent the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master into a frenzy. “You scoundrel! I’ll rip you into pieces! I’ll ground your bones down into ashes!”

Pu! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

With a spurt of fresh blood, the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master fell silent. He had been decapitated.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had ended the life of the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master with his hand there and then.

“You are taking me as a pushover just because I have been nice thus far,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist sneered at the dead Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master. Cold murderous intent flared from him.

Both the Ancient Era’s clan leaders and their grand elders trembled in fear.

“Puppeteer Exalted, there’s no need to go this far. You have accomplished your goal. What you want is right there. There’s no need for you to kill us all. Your partnership with our Blood Phoenix Royal Clan has been pleasant thus far,” the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s grand elder said.

He retracted his killing intent and anger. He was willing to humble himself to live.

The Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s Clan Chief anxiously nodded in agreement too.

“Oh?” The Ox-nosed Old Daoist turned to the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s Clan Chief and grand elder. The savagery on his face vanished without a trace, replaced with an amicable smile. “You look like you really want to live.”

He turned to the others. “What about you? Do you not want to live?”

“Puppeteer Exalted, they are right. There’s no need for us to be hostile to each other. We can continue our partnership, but this time around, we’ll obediently follow your orders since you’re the strongest of us all. With our combined strength and your grasp of the present era, we can rise above the others and become the rulers of the vast world of cultivation! You can take the lion’s share of the benefits, and all we’ll ask for is just the crumbs.”

Seeing a ray of hope, the other clan leaders and grand elders lowered their postures and spouted all of the nice words they could think of.

Despite that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into laughter, “Hahahaha!”

Everyone stiffened up. They sensed something wrong with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s laughter. It sounded as if he was laughing after hearing a joke; he was mocking them.

“The rumors are true. I paid a visit to all of the top powers of the present era and the Ancient Era. I even relayed the news to some of the minor powers.”

At this point, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist raised his hand and took back the pendant, which contained the formation realm filled with present-era cultivators and world spiritists. He shook the pendant.

“That’s where these people came from. They are greedy just like you. But, as I have told you, I am from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Do you think I staged all of this just for the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasure? No, I wanted to see who harbors malicious intentions toward my Ancestral Martial Galaxy too. ”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist tightened his grip. Kacha! The pendant snapped into two.

A spirit formation gate appeared, and countless cultivators and world spiritists gushed out from within like a leaking dam. These were the present-era cultivators who had been in the pendant’s formation realm.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had liaised not just the Ancient Era’s clans but the present-era cultivators too. These were the people who answered his rally. Most were misfits, but there were noteworthy figures, including experts from top powers who snuck in under another identity.

Some of them trusted the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words and wanted a share of the pie. Some of them had been observing the situation, waiting for an opportunity to make a move. Regardless of their motives, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist saw them in the same light.

Since they dared to come, they deserved to die.

Fresh blood gushed out. All of them died before they could scream. They didn’t even know why they were killed.

“All right. It’s your turn, esteemed milords from the Ancient Era,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said after casually slaying tens of millions of cultivators.

“Puppeteer Exalted, stop pretending to be the noble one here. This wouldn’t have happened at all if not for your scheming. There are casualties on the side of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy too. You’re just an unscrupulous man who will do anything to achieve your goal,” the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s Clan Chief roared.

“Woah, what a smart guy you are! But does it matter whether you’re right or not? Bark all you want, relics from the Ancient Era. This is the final moment of your long life. You don’t have to worry though. You won’t be lonely on your journey. I’ll bury your clans with you,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied with a smile.

He opened his palm, and a terrifying formation surfaced.

Boom!

The formation swiftly expanded. It was so powerful that all lives were equal before it. It was not just the surviving Ancient Era’s clansmen inside the distant formation realm who were killed, but even their Heavenly God level experts were obliterated as well.

After killing everyone, the tremendous formation contracted and returned into the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s palm. The world fell silent.

Despite the jarring blood stench, nothing could be seen anymore. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had taken away all their treasures and broken down their corpses. There were only three people left in this vast space—the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, and the woman in a white dress.

However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist paid no heed to them. After dealing with the crowd, he turned his sight toward the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city. Step by step, he made his way toward it.
