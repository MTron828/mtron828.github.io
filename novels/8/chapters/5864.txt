Chapter 5865: Wen Xue’s Life Soul

Wen Xue was a cultivation treasure Chu Feng had previously encountered in the Purple Star Hall, as well as a monstrous beast. She had once infiltrated Chu Feng’s dantian with the intent of devouring his bloodline, only to be defeated by Chu Feng’s bloodline. To escape, she had no choice but to leave her Life Soul inside Chu Feng’s body.

She ended up being taken in by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, and it was then that she was named Wen Xue.

Wen Xue was not a human; rather, she had existed for a very long time. However, it was only recently that she had gained a new life, making her a junior younger than Chu Feng and Zi Ling.

She had been wanting to get back her Life Soul, but Chu Feng refused to return it to her.

“I still have her Life Soul,” Chu Feng said.

Before the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster could say a word, Zi Ling said, “Big brother Chu Feng, you should return Junior Wen Xue’s Life Soul to her.”

Chu Feng knew that Zi Ling wouldn’t make this request for no reason, so he asked, “Zi Ling, did something happen?”

Zi Ling explained the situation to him.

Zi Ling wanted to do her part for the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect upon realizing that it was in crisis, so she broke out of her closed-door cultivation, but the consequences were more severe than she had expected, nearly costing her life. It was Wen Xue who used her unique energy to stabilize her condition, but that put Wen Xue in a dangerous position instead.

“Lord Sectmaster, where’s Wen Xue?” Chu Fen asked. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Follow me.”

The sectmaster brought Chu Feng and Zi Ling to a cavern enveloped by a recovery formation. This formation was rarely invoked except in exceptional circumstances.

In the empty cavern, a golden-haired woman floated amidst concentrated spirit power. She had delicate facial features, and she looked to have grown a fair bit compared to before. However, her face looked ghastly pale, and her condition didn’t seem optimistic. She was none other than Wen Xue.

Her aura was particularly weak. There were peculiar intertwining marks on her right arm that delved into her body, leading toward a center point that was reminiscent of a formation core. However, this center was empty.

“Master, why did Junior Wen Xue’s injuries worsen?” Zi Ling frowned.

“She expended herself too much. She must have shaken her foundation trying to save you. This recovery formation slows the worsening of her injuries, but it can’t cure her of her ailment.” The sectmaster turned to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, I know there’s a grudge between you and Wen Xue, but we wouldn’t have asked you to return her Life Soul to her if there was any other solution.”

“Wen Xue’s current condition is a result of her treating Zi Ling?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right,” the sectmaster replied.

Chu Feng was surprised. He had always seen Wen Xue as someone to be wary of, so he didn’t think that she would put herself in danger trying to save Zi Ling.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I was the one who landed Junior Wen Xue in her current state.” Zi Ling looked at Chu Feng with pleasing eyes.

Chu Feng patted Zi Ling’s head and said, “Don’t worry, we’ll return this favor to her.”

Chu Feng formed a hand seal and channeled his spirit power. He immersed his consciousness into his dantian and began constructing a powerful formation on a small speck of light. It was the Life Soul Wen Xue had left inside his body back then.

Chu Feng didn’t trust Wen Xue. He knew that she was powerful, having witnessed what she was capable of. She wasn’t in her complete state at the moment, for the strongest part of her had been left behind in Chu Feng’s dantian.

To be safe, he constructed a formation on her Life Soul so that he could restrict her if needed. Once he was done, he took out Wen Xue’s Life Soul from his dantian and held it in his palm.

With his current means, it was impossible to tell that he had tampered with her Life Soul.

“This is Wen Xue’s Life Soul?”

Both the sectmaster and Zi Ling were mesmerized. They sensed that her Life Soul harnessed a tremendous amount of energy far surpassing Wen Xue’s current strength, which meant that returning Wen Xue’s Life Soul to her would not only treat her injuries but push her to a greater height.

“Yes,” Chu Feng replied.

When Wen Xue revealed her identity and demanded Chu Feng to return her Life Soul to her, Chu Feng had asked the sectmaster about her take on the matter. It was the sectmaster who told him not to return her Life Soul yet, saying that he could use it to curb her.

It was also under the sectmaster’s intention now that he was revealing the Life Soul to her.

He could see the hesitation and dilemma in the sectmaster’s eyes.

Wen Xue’s cultivation might not surge right after receiving her Life Soul, but it would unleash her true potential, and her cultivation would grow by leaps and bounds. This should have been good news since Wen Xue was her disciple, but she was conflicted because she knew what kind of existence Wen Xue was before.

Wen Xue was indeed an unstable factor. At the very least, she used to pose a major threat.

Wu!

Wen Xue suddenly groaned. She frowned in pain, and her breathing became fainter.

“Master, Junior Wen Xue will die at this rate!” Zi Ling said with a pleading voice.

She knew that Wen Xue was dangerous, but she couldn’t allow the latter to die just like that, not after the latter landed in her current state to save her. The sectmaster looked torn.

This was the first time Chu Feng saw such an anxious look on the sectmaster’s face. She didn’t hesitate so much even when she was faced with the Ancient Era’s clans. However, she quickly composed herself, and her conflicted expression vanished.

She turned to Chu Feng and said, “This Life Soul should be able to save Wen Xue’s life. I’ll be counting on you, Chu Feng.”

The sectmaster had chosen to trust Wen Xue.

Chu Feng didn’t hesitate to return Wen Xue’s Life Soul to her, since he had already prepared a hidden hand. He quickly constructed a formation, and with it as a catalyst, it didn’t take long for the Life Soul to be returned to Wen Xue’s body.

The unique marks on Wen Xue’s arm slowly vanished, and Wen Xue’s breathing calmed down. Her aura swiftly began to recover.

Both the sectmaster and Zi Ling heaved a sigh of relief.

“This feeling!” Chu Feng’s heart clenched up.

He sensed that the formation he had fused inside Wen Xue’s Life Soul was swiftly unraveling. He quickly looked at Wen Xue and saw that she had already woken up and was looking at him with a sweet smile, but somehow, this smile looked incredibly eerie.
