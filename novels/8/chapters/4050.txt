Chapter 4050 - Eliminating The Sinner

“Boom~~~”

Once the forbidden medicine entered Wuming Doutian’s mouth, his body began to surge with crimson gaseous flames in addition to the purple gaseous flames.

The two flames inter-wove with one another. Not only did they not attack each other, they instead began to fuse in perfect harmony.

Everyone was able to sense that Wuming Doutian had become much stronger than before. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“He took another forbidden medicine?”

“He took two forbidden medicines in succession. Why is he not injured by it, but instead had had his battle power increased?”

“Could it be...”

The crowd were all astonished by the scene they saw. They all felt that they might have been deceived.

“Boom~~~”

In the next moment, white gaseous flames actually appeared from Wuming Doutian’s body.

Three different kinds of gaseous flames were present on his body now.

With the three gaseous flames fused together, Wuming Doutian’s battle power had reached the pinnacle.

He was now infinitely close to rank four Utmost Exalted.

“This...”

The crowd turned pale. They had finally realized everything.

They were able to sense that the white gaseous flames were also a sort of forbidden medicine’s power.

Wuming Doutian was emitting the power of three forbidden medicines.

Yet, the crowd had only seen him taking two.

What did this signify?

It signified that Chu Feng had not lied to them; that he had not wrongly accused Wuming Doutian.

Wuming Doutian had indeed taken a forbidden medicine in his fight against Chu Feng earlier!

The crowd realized that they had wrongly blamed Chu Feng for lying.

That said, Wuming Doutian did not bother paying any attention to the crowd at all. He had already anticipated all of this the moment he took out the third forbidden medicine.

None of that mattered to him anymore. The only thing in his mind at that moment was eliminating Chu Feng. He did not care what the consequences would be.

“Heeeahhh!”

Wuming Doutian shouted loudly. Then, he pushed pressed against the air with his palms.

The three gaseous flames turned into a violent wind that shot straight toward Chu Feng.

“Buzz~~~”

When the violent wind fused with the black spear, the black spear began moving forward.

At the same time, Chu Feng revealed a frown. A slight look of pain appeared on his face.

‘I’ve disguised my world spirit techniques as a martial cultivator’s cultivation. Because of that, I’m unable to fully reveal my world spirit techniques’ battle power. This Wuming Doutian took three forbidden medicines in succession; his battle power is approaching the limit of rank three Utmost Exalted.’

‘It would appear that I cannot conceal my world spirit techniques anymore. I have no choice but to reveal them.’

‘Forget it, as matters stand, so what if I expose my world spirit techniques?’

‘Wuming Doutian, I, Chu Feng, shall take you on with my full strength!’

Thinking of that, a look of determination appeared in Chu Feng’s eyes.

“Paaa~~~”

Chu Feng suddenly tightened the grasp of his palm. The weapon in his hand shattered.

The crowd were all astonished to see that. After all, what Chu Feng held in his hand was an Incomplete Exalted Armament. How was he able to crush his Incomplete Exalted Armament?

“Something’s amiss!”

Soon, the crowd discovered something fishy.

After Chu Feng’s Incomplete Exalted Armament shattered, it turned into gaseous flames that drifted in the air.

It turned out, it was world spirit power.

“Why would that weapon turn into world spirit power?”

At the time that the crowd was confused, a loud explosion sounded from within Chu Feng.

Looking over, boundless power rushed out of his body like a tidal wave.

It was spirit power, Dragon Mark Saint-level spirit power.

“Dragon Mark! Chu Feng... he’s a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?!”

Seeing the incomparably sacred spirit power that covered the horizon, the crowd were all stunned.

After the spirit power was released, the crowd were no longer able to sense any other power in the vicinity.

Even the aura of Wuming Doutian, whose battle power had been greatly strengthened through the use of three forbidden medicines, had disappeared.

Only a single aura, a single kind of oppressive might, was present in the surroundings. It was Chu Feng’s oppressive might.

Chu Feng had dominated the entire region.

Chu Feng was the ruler of the region!

“Wuming Doutian, I told you that you shouldn’t have used those forbidden medicines.”

“Even if though you took them, they’re still useless. You won’t be able to change anything today.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng took a step forward. “Bang,” the black spear before Chu Feng was knocked away.

Wuming Doutian was sent flying. He crashed into the Wuming Clan’s army.

Oppressive might. It was Chu Feng’s oppressive might. His oppressive might had filled the surroundings with his spirit power.

Although it was an oppressive might from spirit power, it possessed the battle power of a rank three Utmost Exalted.

“Heavens! I got it now! Chu Feng was actually fighting against Wuming Doutian using world spirit techniques!”

“His Incomplete Exalted Armament, martial skills and Immortal Techniques had all been made by his world spirit techniques.”

“But, how could world spirit techniques possess such strong battle power? How could world spirit techniques be able to suppress a rank three Utmost Exalted?”

The crowd realized what was happening. However, because they realized what was happening, they became even more astonished. They felt what was happening to be inconceivable.

In their minds, although Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists were extremely powerful, they couldn’t possibly possess such strong battle power.

“You... exactly what kind of monster are you?” said Wuming Doutian.

Fear was actually present in his eyes.

After being unable to defeat Chu Feng even after taking three forbidden medicines, he had given up all hope.

He had never imagined that Chu Feng would be able to defeat him using world spirit techniques.

This made him feel extremely complicated.

According to his understanding, even if one were a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, one would only possess a battle power comparable to that of a rank one Utmost Exalted at the very most.

However, that was only comparable, and not actually being able to contend against a rank one Utmost Exalted.

Thus, why?

Exactly why was Chu Feng able to suppress him?

Ignoring his own battle power, he had taken three forbidden medicines in succession.

His current battle power was infinitely close to the limit of rank three Utmost Exalted. Yet, he was still being completely suppressed by Chu Feng!

Could Chu Feng’s talent truly be so powerful that it shattered the known restrictions, the known boundaries, the known conventions?

How enormous of a talent must it be?!

Wuming Doutian was not the only one who was astonished. The expressions of the crowd had all turned rigid with shock.

It was no longer at a level of ordinary astonishment. Rather, they were horrified.

After Chu Feng revealed his true might, everyone was horrified by him.

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

Rumbles exploded in succession.

It was Chu Feng.

He was walking toward the Wuming Clan, walking towards Wuming Doutian.

With every step he took, heaven and earth trembled, and the crowd’s hearts trembled with them.

Chu Feng’s enormous power not only covered heaven and earth, it had also affected the bodies of the people in the crowd, and was shocking their souls.

As Chu Feng had became ruler of the entire region, he naturally also ruled over their lives.

Seeing the current Chu Feng, no one dared to disrespect him, much less ridicule, him.

They realized that Chu Feng was no longer the young man from the past.

He had grown to become the most powerful existence in their Ancestral Martial Starfield.

At least, Wuming Doutian was already powerless to retaliate against him.

Seeing Chu Feng slowly walking towards Wuming Doutian, seeing the Wuming Clansmen shielding Wuming Doutian behind them with fearful expressions as they looked at Chu Feng, many Chu Heavenly Clansmen actually started weeping bitter tears.

They were crying from the relief of an enormous pressure.

For countless years, the Chu Heavenly Clan had lived under the Wuming Clan’s shadow.

This shadow had simply enshrouded them for too long, so long that they felt fear towards the Wuming Clan from the bottoms of their hearts.

However, the shadow and all of the fear was finally about to disappear.

Chu Feng had changed everything.

From that moment onward, no one would dare look down on their Chu Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Their Chu Heavenly Clan would be able to rule the Ancestral Martial Starfield with perfect legitimacy. All of this... was due to Chu Feng.

Soon, Chu Feng arrived before the Wuming Clansmen and stood before Wuming Doutian.

Originally, the Wuming Clan’s experts were trying to stop Chu Feng.

However, with a single wave of Chu Feng’s palm, a muffled expresion sounded, and an Utmost Exalted expert exploded before them.

It was Wuming Fenghong!

Wuming Fenghong, the person who had been trying to kill the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief earlier, was killed by Chu Feng with a single palm strike.

“Anyone that dares to block me shall suffer the same fate as him.”

Chu Feng swept his icy gaze across the Wuming Clan’s experts.

Those experts that had once considered the Chu Heavenly Clan and Chu Feng to be ants did not even dare to meet Chu Feng’s gaze.

They silently lowered their heads and moved away from Wuming Doutian.

Between their own lives and protecting their lord, they ultimately chose to protect themselves.

Seeing that, Chu Feng laughed mockingly.

Those people had oppressed everyone without regard with Wuming Doutian backing them.

Yet, when their Lord Realm Master was faced with death, they chose to cower, to escape.

How laughable it was.

Chu Feng turned his gaze to Wuming Doutian. The ridicule in his eyes grew even stronger, “Wuming Doutian, it’s time for you to pay for your sins.”

“Heh...” Wuming Doutian actually laughed after hearing those words.

“Did you really think that you’d be able to end it all by killing me?”

“You’re gravely mistaken. You all will not be able to rule this Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Remember, only our Wuming Clan is able to rule over the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Apart from our Wuming Clan, regardless of whether it be the Linghu Heavenly Clan, Ancestral Martial Dragon City or your Chu Heavenly Clan, none of you will be able to rule the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“If you insist on ruling over it, you will only bring forth a calamity of death and total extermination.”

Wuming Doutian was actually looking at Chu Feng with a mocking expression.

“Is that so? In that case, I shall see exactly what this calamity looks like.”

“I, Chu Feng, await it.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed. A sinister look appeared on his face as killing intent filled his eyes.

He... was about to eliminate Wuming Doutian, eliminate the man who had forced his grandfather and father to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield, eliminate the sinner who had ruled the Ancestral Martial Starfield for over ten thousand years.
