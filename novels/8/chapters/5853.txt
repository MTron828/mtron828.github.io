Chapter 5854: Ancestral Martial Realm Sect

Chapter 5854: Ancestral Martial Realm Sect

The formation cores deployed all over the Ancestral Martial Galaxy suddenly became stronger.

At the same time, Chu Feng’s voice was projected throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Galaxy, “My brethren from the same galaxy, you have worked hard thus far. Our enemies are powerful, so we have no choice but to give everything we have to protect our galaxy. I made some adjustments to our protective formation. You’ll feel a huge amount of strain later on, but it’ll only last for an incense stick’s time. After that, the protective formation will continue to protect us even without you channeling it.

“However, it won’t be easy to last this incense’s time, so I hope you’ll grit your teeth and hold on. That being said, you should back off if you sense yourself in danger. We are protecting our galaxy so that we can continue living our lives in peace. The last thing I’d want is meaningless sacrifices. Now, I beseech all of you to do everything you can for the sake of our galaxy.”

Chu Feng placed the formation token between both his hands and formed a hand seal.

The surrounding space shook, as Chu Feng’s spirit power flowed into the formation token.

Everyone throughout the Ancestral Martial Galaxy channeled their energy into the formation too. As Chu Feng had previously warned, they felt a huge strain, but most clenched their jaws and held on. Even if they made noises, they were not groans of pain but furious roars.

Some couldn’t hold on and had to give up, but some desperately held on till they passed out. Some even expended their lives for it.

More and more people collapsed.

By the end of the incense’s time, less than a hundredth of the countless cultivators in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy were left standing.

Chu Feng changed his hand seal and roared, “Activate!”

The colossal protective formation shrouding the Ancestral Martial Galaxy began transforming, becoming stronger than ever.

“Why did that formation become even stronger?”

Those from the Ancient Era’s clans looked awful. They had already sacrificed their top prodigies to continue their assault on the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but it looked like the tides were against them.

...

Those who had traveled a far distance to witness this spectacle also saw what was happening.

“Is it Chu Feng? It has to be Chu Feng’s doing, right?”

“Who else could it be?”

The crowd discussed amongst themselves. Despite being unable to see what was happening inside, they still attributed the credit to Chu Feng. They couldn’t think of anyone else who could pull this off.

Two energies began to surface on the protective formation. The protective formation slowly grew translucent, and the energies became more tangible.

One of them was nine-colored lightning, whereas the other one was strong spirit power.

Neither was conspicuous, but they were still noticeable. On top of it, they carried Chu Feng’s auras, showing that he was the one who brought about the changes to the protective formation.

“It is him! To think that a junior modified a protective formation of that scale...”

“Just what kind of monster is he?”

The spectators were awed. They had heard about how he had stomped the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and dominated the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, but those were ultimately rumors. Most of them weren’t able to see it in person.

However, his accomplishments today were open for all to see.

He fended against the Ancient Era’s clans through the protective formation. As much as this reflected his courage, it also showed that he was a talented individual. His means surpassed their expectations.

“Jie Ranqing’s son is outstanding indeed.”

“I’m more curious to know who Chu Feng’s father is.”

“Is he really just an ordinary person? That can’t be. An ordinary person can’t possibly have such an outstanding son, right?”

The crowd wondered about Chu Xuanyuan’s identity.

More information about Chu Feng was dug out following his conflict with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

It had become common knowledge that Chu Feng was from the Chu Heavenly Clan, which resided in the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. His grandfather was Chu Hanxian, and his father was Chu Xuanyuan. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Xuanyuan might have been a renowned prodigy in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but the strength he had displayed back then was not worth a mention compared to that of the vast world of cultivation.

However, those who were smarter figured that things weren’t as simple as they seemed.

As formidable as Jie Ranqing was, Chu Feng couldn’t have been that strong if Chu Xuanyuan’s talent was sorely lacking. For instance, Chu Feng’s powerful Heavenly Lightning Bloodline must have come from his father.

Besides, how could an ordinary person possibly catch the eye of a woman like Jie Ranqing?

...

“What’s wrong, Chu Feng?”

The people surrounding Chu Feng suddenly tensed up. He had suddenly collapsed to the ground in a weakened state.

Zi Ling and the others were anxious to see that. Those from the other realms were worried too. They had channeled their energy into the protective formation earlier, which was why they could tell that they had only played a supporting role.

Chu Feng was the one directing everything.

The total energy pumped in by everyone in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy paled far in comparison to the amount Chu Feng pumped in by himself. As ridiculous as that sounded, that was the truth.

“I’m fine, Lord Sectmaster. I just exhausted myself too much. Lord Sectmaster, please inform everyone not to leave the protective formation until I wake up...” Chu Feng said before passing out.

Old Man Compliance, Daoist Niantian, and the others rushed forward to diagnose Chu Feng’s condition.

“He isn’t in danger, but he has used too much energy. Anyone else who did what he did would have died many times over by now. Other than being incredibly talented, young friend Chu Feng’s willpower is unimaginably strong too,” Old Man Compliance said.

Those were words of compliment, but there was not a single person who smiled. They couldn’t imagine just what Chu Feng had suffered in that short incense stick’s time.

...

“That Chu Feng is a thorn in our back!”

Hatred toward Chu Feng had reached a peak in the formation realm where the Ancient Era’s clans dwelled. If not for Chu Feng, they would have breached the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation by now.

“Everyone, it’s done.” Puppeteer Exalted suddenly laughed.

“It’s done?” The crowd turned to Puppeteer Exalted.

“At this point, I have to be honest with you. The remnant we are looking for is indeed in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but it isn’t in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. I only declared that we’ll attack the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect because I know they have such a protective formation. Their protective formation is necessary to open the remnant.”

Puppeteer Exalted took out an old key. It was old, but it was from the early years of the present era. Inscribed on it were the words ‘Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’.
