Chapter 2167 - Chu Feng, Quickly, Escape

“Thanks,” Chu Feng received the Demon Subduing Spring Water and expressed his thanks to the Tang Family’s Family Head. Then, he turned to Tang Ying and said, “I will go and eliminate that demonic woman first. After that, I will return and uphold my promise to be your bodyguard for a month.”

“Tang Long, Tang Hu, prepare men to help little friend Chu Feng eliminate that demonic woman,” The Tang Family’s Family Head ordered.

“There’s no need for that. I myself am sufficient,” Chu Feng said. The way he saw it, other than the Tang Family’s Family Head, no one in the Tang Family was stronger than him.

As for the Tang Family’s Family head, he would definitely stay to oversee the Tang Family. As such, it would be impossible for him to go and assist Chu Feng in eliminating that demonic woman. Thus, rather than bringing a bunch of burdens with him, it would be better for Chu Feng to go alone.

“Merely, little friend Chu Feng, for you to go alone, I fear...” The Tang Family’s Family Head was worried.

“Father, please rest assured. Chu Feng was able to kill even the Ghostfiend Beast. No matter how strong that demonic woman might be, she would not necessarily be a match for Chu Feng,” Tang Ying declared proudly.

“Oh?” Hearing that, the Tang Family Family Head revealed a surprised gaze. Although the people from Heavenly Clans were all very powerful, he evidently had not expected Chu Feng to be so powerful that he could even kill a Ghostfiend Beast. After all, he also knew that Ghostfiend Beasts were extraordinary existences.

“Since that’s the case, then, little friend Chu Feng, I wish you luck on your journey,” The Tang Family’s Family Head said.

“Eldest Young Master, this is bad!” Right at this moment, a Half Martial Ancestor-level expert rushed in.

When this old man saw the Tang Family’s Family Head after rushing in, he immediately revealed an overjoyed expression. Happiness appeared on his panicking face.

“Master, y-y-you’ve actually recovered? This is truly great! Even the Heavens are looking out for our Tang Family!” said that old man.

The Tang Family’s Family Head noticed that something was amiss. Thus, he asked, “What happened?”

“Master, the Cao Family has refused to comply with their agreement. They have led their army to attack us before the promised time. Right now, the Cao Family’s army is already outside the city; they have already sealed off our Tang Family, and are planning to besiege the city,” The old man reported.

“What?!” Hearing those words, the crowd present all revealed surprised expressions.

“Rumble~~~”

“Rumble~~~”

............

......

Right at that moment, rumbles began to sound from outside. Someone was attacking the Tang Family’s defensive formation. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Chu Feng immediately activated his Heaven’s Eyes. After he looked outside, he discovered that a dense amount of people had already entered the city. From all directions, they had tightly sealed off the Tang Family.

There were a lot of experts among them. Especially the leading old man; his age was about the same as the Tang Family’s Family Head. He was an extremely thin old man.

Not only was this old man thin, his stature was also very short and small. His height was only around a hundred and sixty centimeters. He was shorter than even ordinary women.

However, this old man’s eyes gave off a shrewd light. Furthermore, he emitted the powerful oppressive might of a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor.

Without even having others introduce him, Chu Feng was able to guess that that old man must be the Cao Family’s Family Head.

At that moment, that Cao Family’s Family Head was unleashing nonstop attacks at the Tang Family’s defensive formation.

The might of an Incomplete Ancestral Armament being used by him, a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor, could be said to be extremely frightening. Cracks had already started to appear in the Tang Family’s defensive formation; it would soon be destroyed.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, a loud explosion sounded. The Cao Family’s Family Head had managed to shatter the Tang Family’s defensive formation.

After destroying the defensive formation, the Cao Family’s Family Head shouted, “Soldiers of the Cao Family, listen up. Kill all the people from the Tang Family!!!”

“Yes Milord!!!”

Following his shout, an elite army of several tens of thousands entered the Tang Family’s territory following the Cao Family’s Family Head.

Their oppressive Ancestral-level oppressive might arrived before them. Countless palaces and towers were shattered by their oppressive might. In merely an instant, thousands of people from the Tang Family were killed.

In response, the Tang Family’s Family Head shouted, “All those from the Tang Family that are alive, prepare to face the enemy!!!”

Then, he soared into the air and charged into the sky.

“Tang Haichuan? You’re actually fine?” The people from the Cao Family were shocked by the appearance of the Tang Family’s Family Head.

“Unfaithful vile bastard, did you consider the promise of a month’s time to be fart?!” The Tang Family’s Family Head’s anger was overwhelming. As he cursed at the Cao Family’s Family Head, he held his Incomplete Ancestral Armament and charged to attack the Cao Family’s Family Head.

At the same time, the elites from the Tang Family also soared into the air and collided with the Cao Family’s army.

“Unfaithful? You are the one who decided to violate the marriage agreement first. Yet you dare to say that I am unfaithful? How shameless can you be?” The Cao Family’s Family Head said coldly.

“Do you not fear Zhao Chengxing?” The Tang Family’s Family Head said.

“Hahaha. You’re talking about Zhao Chengxing, that man who mounted a sneak attack against you and left you with a serious injury?”

“Truth be told, the reason why I dared to come and attack your Tang Family is because I have already eliminated him.”

“Today, your Tang Family shall be eliminated,” Once the Cao Family’s Family Head declared that, the void started to tremble. It was as if he was completely confident that he would be able to eliminate the Tang Family.

“What shameless boasting!!!” The Tang Family’s Family Head was so enraged that his complexion turned red. At the same time, his attacks grew more and more ferocious.

However, the Cao Family’s Family Head was not afraid in the slightest. As the two men fought, their attacks engulfed their surroundings. The others simply did not dare to approach them.

“Brother Chu Feng, I’m sorry to inconvenience you, but please protect my little sister. If you are able to find an opportunity, please bring her away from here.”

“Please!” After Tang Long said those words to Chu Feng, he soared into the sky and joined the battle.

“Chu Feng, what should we do?” Tang Ying looked at Chu Feng with a panicky expression.

“Don’t panic, your Tang Family will not necessarily be defeated,” Chu Feng said.

“Really?” Tang Ying felt disbelief.

“I have already observed the situation. Although the Cao Family is very strong, your Tang Family is not weak either. In the amount of people and overall strength, your Tang Family is equally matched with the Cao Family. Thus, your Tang Family might not necessarily be defeated,” Chu Feng said.

“But, according to our reliable sources, the strength of the Cao Family should surpass that of our Tang Family,” Tang Ying still felt disbelief.

“There’s only one explanation for this. That is, the Cao Family has really taken care of your father’s old friend before coming to attack the Tang Family. This is why their strength has suffered some damage,” Chu Feng said.

“Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap~~~”

“Not bad, your analysis is very good.”

“However, as long as I am here, the Tang Family will definitely be defeated.”

Right at that moment, the sound of clapping was heard. Following that, an indifferent voice was heard.

This person was wearing the outfit of the Cao Family. He had the appearance of a young man. However, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that this man had lived for at least several hundred years.

This man’s cultivation was not weak either; he was a rank four Half Martial Ancestor. Furthermore, his aura was much stronger than that of ordinary rank four Half Martial Ancestors; he was an existence that possessed heaven-defying battle power. Although his heaven-defying battle power was only capable of surmounting one level of cultivation, he remained stronger than ordinary Half Martial Ancestors.

“What arrogance,” Chu Feng laughed mockingly. Although his opponent was a rank four Half Martial Ancestor that possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation, Chu Feng did not place him in his eyes at all.

Although Chu Feng was not afraid, Tang Ying turned pale with fear after seeing that man. She began to step back repeatedly. It was as if she had just seen a demon. Chu Feng was able to sense that Tang Ying was shivering from head to toe.

“Haha, it would seem that you do not know who I am,” That man laughed out loud.

“I could care less who you are,” Chu Feng said.

“Hahaha, you are truly young and ignorant,” That man was not angered by Chu Feng’s words. Instead, with a smile on his face, he looked to Tang Ying, “Tang Ying, tell this ignorant fool exactly who I am.”

After hearing those words, Tang Ying suddenly pushed Chu Feng away and shouted, “Chu Feng, quickly, escape. Do not concern yourself with me.”
