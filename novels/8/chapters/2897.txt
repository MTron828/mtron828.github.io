Chapter 2897 - Gazes Of Admiration

Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen were chatting with one another enjoyably.

However, this caused the people outside to be completely confused.

At that moment, Xia Yun’er, Asura Zhao Kun, the Nine Profound Sect’s disciples and even the elders outside all had puzzled expressions on their faces.

“What’s going on? That gate had clearly disappeared, why would it suddenly appear again?”

“Could it be that Chu Feng didn’t enter the Death Gate?”

However, even though this was the case, no one dared to rashly enter that gate.

In fact, no one even dared to enter the gate that the Liangqiu sisters had entered.

After all, everyone feared death. If they attempted to enter either gate only for that gate to be the Death Gate. what would they do then?

Even though the crowd wanted to obtain that so-called Legacy Inheritance, no one would be willing to lose their lives to do it.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, the gate on the left started to suddenly and violently tremble.

“There’s movement! Could it be that the Liangqiu sisters are about to come out now?”

“Sure enough, that is the Life Gate.”

Seeing the gate on the left trembling, the Nine Profound Sect’s disciples were immediately excited.

“Woosh, woosh~~~”

Soon, two figures flew out from that gate. Those were none other than the Liangqiu sisters.

However, the crowd was stunned upon seeing the Liangqiu sisters.

After the Liangqiu sisters appeared, they were actually lying on the ground like the world spirits that exited the first Inheritance Site.

Not only that, but their auras were also extremely weak.

“Heavens, what happened in there?!”

“Miss Hongyue, Miss Lanyue, what happened to you two?!”

After being stunned momentarily, the Nine Profound Sect’s disciples hurriedly rushed over to support the Liangqiu sisters.

However, an expression of unease filled their faces. Even though the Liangqiu sisters had exited the gate alive, their appearances simply did not resemble those of people who had received an inheritance.

“Chu Feng... has Chu Feng come out yet?”

Liangqiu Hongyue asked with an incomparably weak voice.

“No, he hasn’t come out after entering that gate. His world spirit also followed him in. She also didn’t come out,” the Nine Profound Sect’s disciple said.

“Damn it, the gate that the two of us entered was the Death Gate,” Liangqiu Hongyue said.

“Death Gate?! That’s the Death Gate?!!”

Hearing those words, not only were the people of the younger generation inside the Inheritance Cave astonished, but those elders outside the Inheritance Cave were also astonished.

At that moment, all of the elders turned their gazes to Zhao Kuangfengyi.

They seemed to be asking with their gazes, ‘Didn’t you say that it was the Life Gate? What is going on here?’

“Cough cough. Miss Liangqiu, could the two of you be mistaken? The one on the left is clearly the Life Gate. Why would the two of you insist on saying it’s the Death Gate?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Seemingly wanting to prove his innocence, Zhao Kuangfengyi asked them directly through the spirit formation.

“We sisters have entered it. How could we not know which is the Life Gate and which is the Death Gate?” Liangqiu Hongyue spoke in a very annoyed manner.

“If that was the Death Gate, how did the two of you return alive?” Zhao Kuangfengyi asked.

“Humph, had we sisters not possessed the defensive formations placed on our bodies by our respected master, we would’ve died in there. How could we possibly return alive?” Liangqiu Hongyue said.

“Was it really your defensive formations that saved you two?” Zhao Kuangfengyi spoke with a skeptical tone.

“What is the meaning of that question? Could it be that you feel that we sisters have obtained the inheritance and made up a lie to deceive you all for the sake of hogging everything?” This time around, it was Liangqiu Lanyue that spoke. Anger was present in her voice.

Evidently, she was extremely dissatisfied with Zhao Kuangfengyi’s questions.

After all, the two of them had nearly lost their lives in there. Their moods were already extremely heavy. Yet now, they were actually being doubted by someone. Regardless of who it was, if they were in their shoes, they would also not be able to endure it.

“Of course not. That is not this old man’s intention at all. I have never doubted you two young misses.”

“Merely, since you two have declared the gate that you’ve entered to be the Death Gate, it would mean that Chu Feng has entered the Life Gate. If that’s the case, why would Chu Feng who entered the Life Gate still show no sign of activity when the two of you have already exited the Death Gate?” Zhao Kuangfengyi asked.

“That’s true, why is there no sign of activity from Chu Feng?”

“If he has truly entered the Life Gate, shouldn’t he leave it immediately and inform us about it?”

Once Zhao Kuangfengyi said those words, he immediately gained the acknowledgement of the crowd. After all, Chu Feng said that he would enter it to check things out. If it was safe, he would return to inform Xia Yun’er and the others.

When thinking of this, even those Nine Profound Sect’s disciples that were supporting the Liangqiu sisters revealed a change in their expressions.

They had also begun to suspect the Liangqiu sisters. They were skeptical as to whether the Liangqiu sisters put forth a lie of entering the Death Gate for the sake of hogging all the inheritance.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, the gate on the right started to tremble. Then, a figure walked out from it.

That person was not only completely unscathed, but he also had a smile on his face. As for that person, he was none other than Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you’re alright?”

Upon seeing Chu Feng, the Starfall Holy Land’s two male disciples immediately rushed over to him.

“I am fine,” Chu Feng replied with a smile on his face.

“In that case, it would mean that you entered the Life Gate?” The Starfall Holy Land’s disciples asked.

“I said it was the Life Gate all along,” Chu Feng said.

“Boom~~~”

Chu Feng’s words came like a sudden clap of thunder that exploded in the hearts of the crowd.

Practically everyone had felt that Chu Feng was making a mistake when he chose the gate on the right. Yet, Chu Feng had actually chosen correctly?!

“Putt~” Asura Zhao Kun fell on his butt. He was not just astonished, he was completely dumbfounded.

He was truly stunned by the shock. The reason for that was because this would mean that Chu Feng had won against Liangqiu Hongyue, and he would have to honor the oath he had made earlier.

It was not only Asura Zhao Kun who was stunned. His grandfather Zhao Kuangfengyi was also stunned.

Chu Feng had chosen the correct gate. This meant that his choice was incorrect.

He, a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s most powerful World Spiritists, was actually inferior to a member of the younger generation. How could he possibly face the world now? His reputation had been completely ruined.

At that moment, the crowd began to look to Chu Feng with extremely complicated gazes. Admiration filled their eyes.

Not to mention Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi, even those Nine Profound Sect’s disciples and elders started to admire Chu Feng enormously.

At the moment when everyone had declared that Chu Feng had made the wrong choice, when even a world spiritist of great authority declared that Chu Feng had made the wrong choice, Chu Feng insisted that his choice was correct.

His confidence and his decisiveness were not things that any ordinary person possessed.

It was something that not even the elders present, those old monsters that had cultivated for many years, possessed.
