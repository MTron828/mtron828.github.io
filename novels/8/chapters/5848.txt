Chapter 5849: Chu Feng Makes a Move; No Mercy!

Chapter 5849: Chu Feng Makes a Move; No Mercy!

An old man dressed in common clothes appeared.

“Old Man Compliance?” Shengguang Baimei widened his eyes in astonishment.

Old Man Compliance was famous in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, with his name spoken alongside Daoist Niantian’s. Shengguang Baimei had met Old Man Compliance before, and he thought that the latter was weaker than him.

Yet, Old Man Compliance was currently emanating an extremely powerful aura. He was the one who killed the pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist and constructed this massive sealing formation to trap those from the Ancient Era’s clans.

“Lord Baimei.” Old Man Compliance politely bowed to Shengguang Baimei. His attitude didn’t change even though he had revealed his true strength.

“Old Man Compliance, I didn’t expect you to be this powerful. You have hidden your strength well.” Shengguang Baimei figured that Old Man Compliance had been strong all this while, just that the latter had been hiding his true strength.

Old Man Compliance smiled in response, not bothering to explain it.

“Old Man Compliance, I thought you were exploring the other galaxies?” Shengguang Baimei asked.

“Lord Baimei, I am from the Holy Light Galaxy. It’s only right for me to return and do my part when someone threatens to run rampant in my homeland,” Old Man Compliance replied.

“How rare it is to find someone of your cultivation who thinks that way.” Shengguang Baimei was moved.

Old Man Compliance was known to be aloof in the Holy Light Galaxy back then. Who could have thought he would return and step up now that they were facing a crisis?

Weng!

Just then, spirit power erupted from the Half-God level cultivators from the Ancient Era’s clans.

Old Man Compliance quickly channeled his formation to suppress them while saying, “Lord Baimei, you should head back and take a rest. Leave this place to me.”

“All right. I shan’t get in your way. Be careful, Old Man Compliance,” Shengguang Baimei replied, knowing he wouldn’t be of any help here.

He returned via the spirit formation gate opened by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, where the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and the Holy Valley’s Holy master were.

“Why did you return? Did you slay all of the invaders?” the Holy Master asked.

Before Shengguang Baimei could say a word, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster replied, “A helper arrived. It’s Old Man Compliance.”

She had seen what had happened earlier through the protective formation.

“Old Man Compliance? How can you entrust such an important job to Old Man Compliance?”

The crowd directed looks of criticism at Shengguang Baimei. They thought that Old Man Compliance was weaker than Shengguang Baimei.

“Milord, Old Man Compliance is stronger than we have expected. He’s likely to be a True God.” Shengguang Baimei proceeded to explain the situation to the Holy Master and the others.

The crowd was both shocked and delighted. They hadn’t expected Old Man Compliance to be the strongest expert in their Ancestral Martial Galaxy, being both a True God level cultivator and a True Dragon World Spiritist.

His strength would have unnerved the Holy Valley under normal circumstances, but now that they were in a crisis, they were relieved there was such a hidden expert among them instead.

“Our Holy Light Galaxy has many hidden experts,” the Holy Master remarked with a conflicted expression.

All along, he thought that he was the strongest person in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but his confidence wavered when he met the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. That belief completely crumbled with the appearance of Old Man Compliance.

The Holy Master was only nearing pinnacle Half-God level, whereas Old Man Compliance had already reached True God level.

“But things aren’t looking good. The restriction on their black light spirit formation gate is still loosening. At this rate, it wouldn’t be long before they start sending True God level cultivators in. Old Man Compliance won’t last long.” The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster sighed.

“This energy?”

Soon, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was forced to rethink her previous opinion. She sensed a powerful energy surging from the formation core into the defensive formation, and it began furiously assaulting the black light spirit formation gate.

The black light spirit formation gate was being restricted. At this rate, the Ancient Era’s clans wouldn’t be able to send True God level cultivators in via the black light spirit formation gate!

Perplexed, she turned her attention toward the formation core, and she soon found the cause behind this anomaly.

“It’s you, Chu Feng!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Through the protective formation, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster saw Chu Feng channeling the formation core. This made perfect sense to her, as Chu Feng could pull off feats that were usually deemed impossible to others.

“That feeling?”

However, her heart soon tensed up again. Another problem had cropped up over at Old Man Compliance’s side.

Old Man Compliance had restrained the Ancient Era’s clansmen with his formation, but he didn’t kill them. Some of the pinnacle Half-God level cultivators began emanating blood-red auras, and their cultivation overcame their bottleneck to reach rank one True God level.

However, this process was extremely painful, and they were startled by what was going on too.

“Igniting their life force to raise their cultivation rank; the Ancient Era’s clans are cruel to their people too.” Old Man Compliance could see what was going on.

The blood-red auras emanated by the Ancient Era’s clansmen carried a strong stench of blood. The runes inscribed on their bodies formed a formation that allowed them to overcome the bottleneck of an entire cultivation level, but they had to pay a heavy price for it—their life force.

Boom!

Old Man Compliance immediately exerted his oppressive might to eliminate those who had made their breakthroughs, but it was too late. Even though those people were in great pain, they now wielded the strength to oppose him.

They charged at Old Man Compliance with Exalted Armaments in hand.

Initially, there were only around a dozen rank one True God level cultivators. As they had raised their cultivation via a formation instead of through training, their fighting prowess was lacking. Due to that, Old Man Compliance was still able to stand his ground against them.

But as more pinnacle Half-God level cultivators made a breakthrough to rank one True God level, Old Man Compliance, who was also at rank one True God level, began to struggle.

In just a few moments, a few hundred pinnacle Half-God level cultivators had already reached rank one True God level. Some pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritists also became True Dragon World Spiritists too.

The True Dragon World Spiritists didn’t charge right into the fray. Instead, they worked with one another to construct a powerful formation that augmented the fighting prowess of the rank one True God level cultivators.

This further put Old Man Compliance at a disadvantage.

Soon, over a thousand cultivators made a breakthrough to rank one True God level. Against such a huge number of enemies, Old Man Compliance couldn’t stand his ground anymore. Frightening gashes appeared all over his body, causing blood to ooze out.

He could have escaped, but he did not attempt to do so, choosing instead to stand his ground. He knew that the Ancestral Martial Galaxy would be in trouble if he landed in defeat here.

Whoosh!

A chain suddenly bound his body, greatly limiting his movement. At the same time, a ferocious killing intent suddenly raged behind him.

Old Man Compliance turned around and saw an elder plunging his Exalted Armament toward his dantian. It was already too late for him to evade this attack.

Pu!

Fresh blood spurted, but Old Man Compliance was unharmed. Instead, it was the attacking elder who had been decapitated.

“Young friend Chu Feng?”

A smile emerged on the weakened Old Man Compliance’s face. Chu Feng had traveled here via a spirit formation gate.

“Take a rest, elder. Leave this to me,” Chu Feng said before rushing into the battlefield with the Immemorial Hero’s Sword in hand.

Old Man Compliance wanted to help him, but that thought faded from his mind when he saw Chu Feng easily slaughtering the rank one True God level cultivators as if a tiger leaping into a pack of dogs.

His sword was unstoppable; it was almost as if he was slicing vegetables instead of humans! Somehow, the rank one True God level cultivators were helpless against Chu Feng.

Fresh blood splattered all around as if blossoming roses of death.

In just a few moments, the thousand True God level cultivators and fifty True Dragon World Spiritists had been completely massacred.

Chu Feng turned his eyes to the remaining Ancient Era’s clansmen.

The Ancient Era’s clansmen shivered under this gaze. They could tell that Chu Feng wasn’t as merciful as Old Man Compliance. It was likely that all of them would die here today.

Chu Feng tossed out his Immemorial Hero’s Sword, and cold gleams of light flashed all around. Screams of agony were accompanied by a rain of fresh blood. The hundreds of thousands of Ancient Era’s clansmen, regardless of their cultivation level and age, were slaughtered without an exception!
