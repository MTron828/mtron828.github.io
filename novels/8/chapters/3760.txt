Chapter 3760 - The Powerful Long Daozhi

“You asked what makes me qualified to warn you?”

As Long Daozhi said those words, a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, his body shifted, and he disappeared. When he reappeared, he was before the black-clothed individual.

“Eeahh~~~”

A scream was heard.

Everything happened too quickly. By the time the crowd reacted to what had happened, they saw that Long Daozhi was standing beside Gu Mingyuan.

As for that black-clothed individual, he had backed several steps away. His arm had been sliced off, and blood flowed from the stump of his shoulder nonstop.

Furthermore, a pained expression filled his face.

This made the crowd realize that his lost arm was most definitely not a simple physical wound. Instead, it was an injury to his soul.

It was similar to when Linghu Hongfei had dug out Chu Lingxi’s eyes. That sort of injury to one’s soul was very difficult to cure.

What astonished the crowd the most was the fact that the black-clothed individual, being a rank three Utmost Exalted, was so powerless and weak before Long Daozhi.

Because of that, the crowd realized that Long Daozhi’s cultivation was at least that of a rank three Utmost Exalted. Otherwise, he couldn’t possibly seriously injure the black-clothed individual so effortlessly.

Rank three Utmost Exalted. This cultivation had surpassed the crowd’s understanding of Long Daozhi. Even though they all knew that he was very powerful, they had not expected him to be this powerful. His strength had long surpassed that of both the Wuming Clan and the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

It turned out that Long Daozhi was actually the strongest expert in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Suddenly, the crowd seemed to finally understand why the Wuming Clan, with how arrogant they were, would be so respectful towards the Three Cities.

Turned out, it was not only because the Three Cities did not involve themselves in the matters of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but it was actually because the Three Cities were so powerful that not even the Wuming Clan dared to provoke them.

“Now do you think I’m qualified?” Long Daozhi asked the black-clothed man.

“You! You dare injure me?! I am a Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect!”

“You will pay for injuring me!”

“I will make all of the people of your Ancestral Martial Starfield pay for my lost arm!!!”

Suddenly, a furious shout filled with killing intent exploded in the sky.

It was that black-clothed individual. As he said those words, he actually removed his conical bamboo hat.

“It’s him?”

Seeing his appearance, the expressions of many people changed.

That person was named Tuoba Chengan. He was one of the All-heaven Sect’s Supreme Elders.

The All-heaven Sect had many Supreme Elders. However, only two of them were capable of becoming the All-heaven Sect’s Sectmaster’s right-hand and left-hand men. As for that Tuoba Chengan, he was one of them.

The status Tuoba Chengan possessed in the All-heaven Sect could be said to be beneath only a single person, and above everyone else.

His status was extraordinary. It could even be said to be extremely important.

Thus, when those people recognized Tuoba Chengan, their hearts all grew tense.

After all, the crowd all believed their Ancestral Martial Starfield to be far inferior to the All-heaven Sect. Although the strength Long Daozhi had displayed was astonishing, they were still worried.

They felt that Long Daozhi injuring Tuoba Chengan was akin to offending the All-heaven Sect. Thus, they were extremely afraid that the people from the All-heaven Sect would decide to openly invade their Ancestral Martial Starfield.

“You truly shouldn’t have said those words to me.”

However, Long Daozhi showed no trace of fear toward Tuoba Chengan’s threat. Instead, he shook his head.

Many people were confused by his reaction.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Long Daozhi moved again.

His speed was simply too fast. By the time the crowd reacted to it, Long Daozhi was no longer where he stood. He had appeared before Tuoba Chengan again.

“You... you...”

At that moment, Tuoba Chengan was trembling all over. His complexion had turned pale. Even speaking had become difficult. Not only was he so weak that he seemed to be on the verge of dying, but his eyes were also filled with disbelief.

He was not the only person who was feeling disbelief. After the crowd managed to get a clear view of the situation, they also felt great disbelief.

Long Daozhi was not only standing before Tuoba Chengan, but his arm had also pierced through Tuoba Chengan’s dantian.

Earlier, Long Daozhi had only sliced off an arm from Tuoba Chengan. However, at that moment, Long Daozhi had destroyed Tuoba Chengan’s cultivation.

This was truly what it meant by a loose tongue causing a lot of trouble. If Tuoba Chengan hadn’t said what he did after losing his arm, Long Daozhi would not have pierced his dantian.

Originally, Long Daozhi had only planned to slice off an arm. However, afterwards, he had decided to cripple his cultivation instead.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Long Daozhi pulled out his arm. As for Tuoba Chengan, he had fallen to his knees in midair. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“We’re done for. We’re done for now!”

Seeing this scene, many people became terrified.

Through the matter of the Linghu Heavenly Clan becoming a puppet, they already knew that the All-heaven Sect wanted to rule their Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Merely, due to some reasons, they were unwilling to openly attempt to dominate the Ancestral Martial Starfield. That was the reason why they had decided to manipulate the Linghu Heavenly Clan from the shadows.

However, the situation at that moment had changed. Long Daozhi was a representative of their Ancestral Martial Starfield.

His act of crippling the All-heaven Sect’s Supreme Elder’s cultivation would be equivalent to issuing a challenge to the All-heaven Starfield.

With that, the Ancestral Martial Starfield would suffer the retaliation of the All-heaven Sect.

To the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the All-heaven Sect was simply too powerful of an existence.

The war between the Linghu Heavenly Clan and the Wuming Clan would, at the very most, implicate some people.

However, if the All-heaven Starfield were to attack them, the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield would be implicated; everyone would be confronted with fatal danger.

That said, compared to the bystanders, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master Long Daozhi’s expression remained unchanged. Not only did he did not show any signs of fear, but he instead spoke to Tuoba Chengan using an extremely cold and grim tone, “Tuoba Chengan, I will not kill you because I need you to return to the All-heaven Sect.”

“You are to personally pass on my words to your All-heaven Sect’s Sectmaster.”

“Tell him to behave himself and stay within his All-heaven Starfield. Don’t think about coming to our Ancestral Martial Starfield again.”

“As for the matters today, our Ancestral Martial Starfield will not look further into it.”

“But...”

“If he is to ignore my warning and attempt to pry into the matters of our Ancestral Martial Starfield again, tell him that he’d best be more secretive with his actions, and not allow me to find out about it.”

“Otherwise, I, Long Daozhi, will become the opponent of your All-heaven Sect.”

After saying those words, an ominous glint flashed through Long Daozhi’s eyes.

Although that ominous glint lasted but an instant, it was captured completely by Tuoba Chengan.

Seeing that ominous glint, the previously furious Tuoba Chengan started to tremble again. Only a single emotion remained on his face -- intense fear.
