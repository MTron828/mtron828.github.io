Chapter 4361: Yin Zhuanghong’s Plight

Chu Feng didn’t continue to attack Lian Xi. Instead, he used his spirit power to fish the latter up from the depths of the ground.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Following that, he formed hand seals with a single hand and began to construct a formation with his spirit power.

Innumerable exquisite daggers arose from the formation. With just a quick glance, there appeared to be tens of thousands of them.

As if an army, these daggers surrounded Lian Xi and his two companions tightly. Any single one of this dagger was more than enough to claim their lives.

The tremendous pressure that Lian Xi and the others felt made their faces turn incredibly awful. They were already aware of how dangerous of a position they were in, and most likely, they might really lose their lives here.

“Chu Feng, we are the personal disciples of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect. if you dare harm us, our Cloudsky Immortal Sect will never let you live!” Lian Xi spat furiously.

Even though he was threatening Chu Feng at this moment, his quivering voice was more than enough to expose his fear.

“Oh? Does this mean that you will take revenge on me? That really simplifies things for me. I should just kill you here and be done with it, isn’t that right?” Chu Feng said with a cold smile.

Those words really scared the two companions of Lian Xi, and they began speaking fearfully, “D-don’t! Please, don’t do it! Y-you wanted to know about Junior Yin, right? We’ll talk, alright?”

“What are you talking about? We’re disciples of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect! How can we bow to mere ants?”

However, Lian Xi continued to put on a spunky attitude.

“It looks like you really have to be taught what kind of position you are in,” Chu Feng sneered.

With a wave of his hand, the daggers that were surrounding Lian Xi and the other two began to glow brightly. Just by looking at this scene, Lian Xi and the other two couldn’t help but imagine themselves being impaled by the countless daggers around them in the next moment.

“D-don’t! Milord, we’ll speak!”

The fear the two companions felt deepened further, and they began begging for mercy once more. As they spoke, they even turned to Lian Xi and said, “Senior Lian Xi, we’re just going to talk about what happened to Junior Yin. There’s no need for us to be so stubborn about this. Junior Yin wouldn’t want us to lose our lives due to this too.”

The two of them appeared to be very concerned about Lian Xi’s point of view, but at the same time, they weren’t willing to die just like that. So, when they tried to convince Lian Xi on the matter, their tone was so anxious that it looked almost as if they would burst into tears if Lian Xi were to turn them down.

As for Lian Xi, even though he was still trying to put on a brave front, he still wasn’t able to conceal the fear in his eyes.

With an absolute disparity in strength between him and Chu Feng, there was no way he wouldn’t be afraid, not to mention that there was a grudge between them in the first place.

So, he waved his hand and said, “Forget it. Go ahead and say whatever you want to. Your mouths are on your faces, I can’t stop you from running your mouths.”

Hearing those words from Lian Xi, ravenous joy broke out on the faces of the other two companions. They immediately turned their gazes toward Chu Feng and explained, “Milord, you must be Junior Yin’s friend, right? You can be assured that Junior Yin has been faring well in our Cloudsky Immortal Sect.”

After that, the two companions began to explain everything concerning Yin Zhuanghong.

As it turned out, Yin Zhuanghong was a member of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect in the very first place, and she was the personal disciple favored by the sectmaster.

It was just that something happened to Yin Zhuanghong while she was younger, resulting in her going missing.

Over the years, the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had been searching desperately for Yin Zhuanghong’s whereabouts, and by some coincidence, they found her at the Red-dress Holy Land.

That resulted in the incident that happened that day.

“Is what you have just said true?” Chu Feng asked doubtfully.

“Milord, I can swear that there’s no falsehood in what I have just said. If you don’t trust my words, you can go and ask around our Cloudsky Immortal Sect. This is a matter that every single member of our sect is aware of!” the two companions exclaimed indignantly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In truth, Chu Feng had his guesses regarding this matter too.

Back then, those people from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect were extremely harsh, not showing the slightest respect toward Red-dress Holy Land, Chu Feng, or the rest at all. Yet, they showed an extremely polite attitude toward Yin Zhuanghong. Just from how they were treating her, it could be seen that they had an extremely high regard for Yin Zhuanghong.

For this reason, Chu Feng had a feeling that they didn’t bear any ill-will toward Yin Zhuanghong.

That being said, there were still some doubts in Chu Feng’s mind.

“If Yin Zhuanghong was that important to the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, why didn’t you talk things out properly back then? Isn’t it going a little overboard to bring things over to that point?” Chu Feng asked.

“Our Cloudsky Immortal Sect is a reputable sect in the Holy Light Galaxy, but you lot don’t recognize our name at all. Furthermore, there were many suspicious details surrounding Junior Yin’s disappearance back then, and that matter has always been a thorn to our sect. Who knows whether you were the ones who took her away back then?

“Besides, we have already made it clear that Junior Yin doesn’t belong there, but you insisted on retaining her there. Aren’t you just asking for a beating?

“However, we also recognize that you all have been taking care of Junior Yin over the years, so despite our dissatisfactions with you lot, we still held ourselves back from killing anyone. Is that not enough for you? How many sects are there in this cultivation world do you think are as benevolent as our Cloudsky Immortal Sect?” Lian Xi added proudly.

Chu Feng couldn’t have possibly imagined that Lian Xi would actually describe what the Cloudsky Immortal Sect did the other day as ‘benevolent’, and that really put him at a loss for word.

That day, they were only courteous to Yin Zhuanghong and Yin Zhuanghong alone. Against their others, their attitude was utterly domineering and belligerent.

But that being said, Chu Feng actually found some sense in what Lian Xi said.

The world of cultivation was a place where the strong reigned supremacy. As a result, most powers tended to act unreasonably against those who were weaker than them.

Back then, even though the attitude taken by the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was nothing short of terrible, they did indeed show mercy by sparing all of their lives.

This was especially so for the elder who had never shown his face from the start to the end. He was the true trump card of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect that day, and if he wanted to, he could have trampled all over the Red-dress Holy Land. Yet, he was the one who kept reminding Lian Xi and the others not to go overboard.

If not for the elder holding the others back, Lian Xi wouldn’t have let Chu Feng go so easily that day either.

“If Yin Zhuanghong was that important to you, why didn’t you give her freedom?” Chu Feng asked once again.

“We have never limited Junior Yin’s freedom after bringing her back to our sect. It’s just that she went into closed-door training as soon as she returned. I’m certain that she would head to the Red-dress Holy Land to report on her breakthrough when she’s finally out of her closed-door training. By then, you would know that we haven’t been lying!” Lian Xi replied.

This fellow’s attitude was still as forceful as ever even when he was conceding defeat. This contrast really made Chu Feng want to laugh.

He was clearly unwilling to lower his head to Chu Feng, but at the same time, he didn’t want to die either. This resulted in his conflicting behavior.

Even though Lian Xi was arrogant, conceited, bullied with weak, and even hurt Chu Feng the other day, perhaps it was because they bore no ill will toward Yin Zhuanghong, Chu Feng didn’t feel like making things difficult for him today.

So, he turned his gaze toward the object which Lian Xi and his two companions had been trying to open all this while, and asked, “What are you doing here? What is inside that object?”

“I can’t tell you that,” Lian Xi replied warily.

“You really aren’t going to tell me?” Chu Feng replied with narrowed eyes.

“Kill us then. I, Lian Xi, wouldn’t stoop so low as to give away the secrets of our sect!”

Who could have thought that Lian Xi was suddenly putting up a tough front yet again?

Furthermore, it didn’t appear that it was just for show this time around. Chu Feng could sense that Lian Xi wouldn’t spit out a word even if he were to hold a blade against the latter’s neck.

This really gave Chu Feng a slightly different impression of Lian Xi.

Even though Lian Xi was filled with a lot of bad traits, such that he would never fit into the stereotype of a good person, his loyalty toward his sect was admirable.
