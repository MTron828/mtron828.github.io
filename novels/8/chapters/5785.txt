Chapter 5785: As Expected of a Trump Card

In truth, Chu Feng wasn’t affected by Huangfu Shengyu’s words at all. He had only retaliated because he saw Little Fishy getting angry on his behalf.

He was skilled at such psychological warfare, so there was no way Huangfu Shengyu could have been a match for him. His words were insulting, and he uttered them with a casual smile that showed he wasn’t affected by Huangfu Shengyu’s words at all.

This made Huangfu Shengyu’s attempt to rile him up look pathetic instead, thus doubling the insult. On top of that, Chu Feng’s words were factual.

Huangfu Shengyu got riled up himself instead.

“Since you’re eager to die, Chu Feng, I’ll show you our Huangfu Heavenly Clan’s means,” Huangfu Shengyu said as the God Armament in his grasp roared.

A huge lightning flood dragon manifested behind him—God Taboo: Lightning Flood Dragon!

Chu Feng knew this move, as Huangfu Fanni had used it before.

However, the lightning flood dragon summoned by Huangfu Shengyu was more than ten times larger than Huangfu Fanni’s, making Huangfu Shengyu look like a speck of dust even though this destructive power was coming from him. Its prowess wasn’t just ten times stronger either.

This was a God Taboo executed by a True God level cultivator.

“Big brother!” Little Fishy exclaimed nervously.

Grar!

With a furious growl, the lightning flood dragon rushed at Chu Feng with devastating might and an unstoppable speed. The crowd turned to look at Chu Feng with eyes filled with worry.

“This feeling?”

Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy suddenly turned to look at Huangfu Shengyu.

Chu Feng had suddenly appeared behind Huangfu Shengyu, and he swiftly thrust the Immemorial Hero’s Sword toward Huangfu Shengyu.

However, the sword failed to pierce Huangfu Shengyu’s body. The latter was wearing a layer of transparent armor, and that was what stopped the sword. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“A defensive formation? That’s not right. Defensive formations don’t work here.” Long Chengyu and the others quickly figured out what was going on.

They were shocked by how Chu Feng was able to appear behind Huangfu Shengyu without any warning, but more than that, they were baffled by the invisible armor that thwarted his assault.

“It’s that token. On top of granting him the cultivation of rank one True God level, it also serves to protect him from harm as well,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

The crowd noticed that another word had appeared on Huangfu Shengyu’s token—’Protect’.

“Isn’t this too much of an advantage?!” Long Chengyu was infuriated.

Huangfu Shengyu was initially horrified, as he had failed to notice Chu Feng’s attack. By the time he snapped out of it, the Immemorial Hero’s Sword was already flying at him. He would have been dead meat if not for the token triggering a defensive layer on its own accord.

But after the initial shock, he retracted his anger and said with a mocking smile, “It was a good attempt, but what a pity it failed. Are you able to hurt me even if I stand right here and not move a step?”

He thrust his God Armament toward Chu Feng, but the latter vanished into thin air.

A split second later, Chu Feng suddenly appeared behind Huangfu Shengyu, thrusting the Immemorial Hero’s Sword toward the latter yet again. Once again, the attack was blocked by the invisible armor.

“It looks like it works more than once,” Chu Feng remarked.

“Die!”

Huangfu Shengyu brandished his God Armament at Chu Feng, but the latter disappeared again.

This time, Chu Feng appeared at a far distance away from Huangfu Shengyu, which induced a frown from the latter. Huangfu Shengyu realized that Chu Feng was moving at a speed beyond the means of a rank one True God level cultivator, so he dared not make a reckless move.

Thus, he executed a martial skill and unleashed countless lightning beasts, but his target was not Chu Feng but Little Fishy and the others.

Boom!

The attack exploded in mid-air shortly after it was released. Chu Feng had stopped the attack.

“Fast! How’s he able to travel so fast? That practically makes him invincible!” Xianhai Shaoyu exclaimed in shock.

Through raising his cultivation to rank nine Half-God level, he was able to roughly perceive the battle between Chu Feng and Huangfu Shengyu. He noticed that Chu Feng moved at a speed surpassing that of rank one True God level cultivators.

It was due to this inconceivable speed that Chu Feng was able to launch surprise attacks on Huangfu Shengyu, as well as foil Huangfu Shengyu’s earlier aggression against them.

Despite how big the ancient hall was, Chu Feng could almost instantaneously reach anywhere he wanted with the speed he was traveling at. This was terrifying!

“Don’t worry, your big brother will win. Huangfu Shengyu’s armor is bound to have a time limit. He’ll be dead meat once the time limit is up,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

He figured that even if Chu Feng’s inconceivable speed had a limit, it should still last longer than Huangfu Shengyu’s armor.

Hu!

Chu Feng’s breathing started becoming ragged.

“Are you sure, Huangfu Shaoyu?” Little Fishy glared at her big brother.

“This…” Xianhai Shaoyu was rendered speechless, as he didn’t think that Chu Feng was faking his exhaustion.

But the truth was that Chu Feng was indeed faking his exhaustion.

He was able to travel at inconceivable speeds thanks to the Divine Deer’s Divine Flitting, which allowed him to reach speeds four cultivation ranks higher. In other words, his speed was on par with a rank five True God level cultivator.

Divine Flitting did have a time limit. He could only maintain his top speed for a short period of time, and his speed would slowly decrease beyond that. That being said, his show of exhaustion was faked.

He had planned to take Huangfu Shengyu’s life with his first attack, but he didn’t expect the token to provide the latter with protection. To make things worse, the token had other powers that were yet to be activated, meaning that Huangfu Shengyu had other means up his sleeves.

Thus, he figured that he should feign weakness and make Huangfu Shengyu lower his guard. He’d bide his time until the invisible armor faded before unleashing a fatal attack on the latter.
