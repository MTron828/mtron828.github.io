Chapter 5107: I Can’t Be Your Older Sister Anymore

Chu Feng was glad to see Chu Lingxi. She had been with her mother, Gu Mingyuan, all this while, so she wasn’t taken away by the mysterious man, unlike the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

“Little sister, when did you return?” Chu Feng showed himself and asked.

Shengguang Baimei and the others could tell that Chu Feng was going to catch up with Chu Lingxi, so they tactfully chose to keep their distance.

“Chu Feng? Why did you come back?”

Chu Lingxi was excited to see Chu Feng too. She ran up to him and asked.

“Why did you come back?” Chu Feng returned the question to her.

“I missed everyone, so I came back to take a look,” Chu Lingxi replied.

“Same here,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, where did everyone go? Did something happen to them?” Chu Lingxi asked worriedly.

It was no secret that the Chu Heavenly Clan had gone missing. Practically everyone in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was aware of it, just that they didn’t know the details. Chu Feng didn’t know any better about it, but his instincts told him that the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were safe and sound.

After all, the mysterious man who kidnapped the Chu Heavenly Clansmen didn’t seem to be an enemy. It was just that he couldn’t figure out that mysterious man’s intention.

“They should be safe. You don’t have to worry about them,” Chu Feng said.

He didn’t reveal the truth since he didn’t want Chu Lingxi to worry, but his assurance wasn’t useful at all. Nevertheless, Chu Lingxi forced out a smile since she didn’t want to burden Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, I’ve already heard about what you have done at the Holy Light Clan. You’re truly formidable. Even the Holy Light Clan needs to fawn on you now. Haa, I’ve only just reached Utmost Exalted level myself, but you’re already at Martial Exalted level. It looks like it’s no longer possible for me to catch up to you. I won’t be able to be your older sister anymore.

“While I’m happy that you’re growing stronger, the thought of having you call me ‘little sister’ really maddens me,” Chu Lingxi said with a pout.

“Young hero Chu Feng is no ordinary Martial Exalted level cultivator. He has already reached rank eight Martial Exalted level,” Shengguang Baimei suddenly spoke out loud as he revealed his silhouette.

Shengguang Buyu and Daoist Niantian showed themselves too.

“Rank eight Martial Exalted level? Are you for real?”

Just as Shengguang Baimei and the others showed themselves, another person appeared in the vicinity. He was none other than the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster. He was accompanied by Chu Lingxi’s mother, Gu Mingyuan.

Chu Feng wasn’t too surprised to see the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and Chu Mingyuan since he had already noticed them. The two of them had probably followed Chu Lingxi here, just that they had been hiding in the shadows all this while.

“Paying respects to the three lords.”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster had appeared out of sheer shock from overhearing Chu Feng’s current cultivation level, but after he calmed down, he quickly turned to Shengguang Baimei and the others and greeted them. He was aware of how powerful the Holy Valley was now.

While Gu Mingyuan didn’t witness it in person, she had heard about the terrifying prowess displayed by Shengguang Baimei the other day. She knew that he was a figure who stood above even the Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief.

Thus, she quickly stepped forward and greeted them too.

Chu Lingxi did the same as well.

“You’re all young hero Chu Feng’s friends, so there’s no need to bother with such formalities,” Shengguang Baimei said with a wave of his hands.

They were afraid of Shengguang Baimei, so they had no choice but to heed his words.

“Young friend Chu Feng, Lord Baimei mentioned earlier that you have reached rank eight Martial Exalted level. Is that true?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster asked curiously.

“Mm.”

Chu Feng nodded.

“My gosh! Aren’t you growing too fast?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster exclaimed in shock.

It hadn’t been long since Chu Feng’s fight with Shengguang Xuanye—and he was already shocked by how Chu Feng was able to stand his ground against Shengguang Xuanye back then—but who could have thought that Chu Feng would push further on to rank eight Martial Exalted level within such a short period of time?

At his current level, he could probably kill Shengguang Xuanye with a mere spit. Unless the Holy Valley got involved, there was no one in the present Holy Valley who could oppose Chu Feng now.

And Chu Feng was only a junior!

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster thought about his first meeting with Chu Feng, and the huge disparity from then and now was hard for him to bear.

“You’re really a madman. Your speed of growth is completely unheard of. If anyone told me that a person could grow that quickly, I would have freaking smacked him into the ground. Even now, I can’t help but feel that you’re pulling my leg!”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster exclaimed in an exaggerated manner, but those were his true feelings. He had known that Chu Feng was talented, but it was still hard for him to believe that Chu Feng had really reached rank eight Martial Exalted level.

As for Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi, the two of them had frozen on the spot. They had known Chu Feng much longer than the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, so the disparity they were seeing was much larger.

“Eyy, what does rank eight Martial Exalted level count as? What’s truly amazing is young hero Chu Feng’s feats in the Nine Souls Galaxy. He’s now dubbed as the hero of the Nine Souls Galaxy, and even the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief greets him with utmost respect,” Shengguang Baimei said gleefully.

“Even the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief greets him with utmost respect?”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and the others were shocked to hear that.

“Lord Baimei, could you tell me what young friend Chu Feng has done?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster asked.

Shengguang Baimei turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Young hero Chu Feng, may I tell them?”

Seeing how Shengguang Baimei was eager to brag about their experiences, Chu Feng couldn’t help but shake his head with a smile. He was reminded of his first meeting with Shengguang Baimei, where the latter was determined to take his life. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Before they knew it, Chu Feng had already become his source of pride.

“Of course,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

Shengguang Baimei started talking about how Chu Feng had grasped control of the Asura World Spirit Army and defeated Sima Xiangtu and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect in the Nine Souls Galaxy. Needless to say, the news came as a huge shock to the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and the others.

This was especially so for Chu Lingxi. The way she looked at Chu Feng changed entirely. She suddenly thought that he looked a little foreign.

It didn’t mean that their relationship had changed, but the gap in their strength and standing was hard to ignore.

“What’s with your gaze?” Chu Feng asked Chu Lingxi, having sensed her changes.

“Eyy, it looks like I’ll never be your older sister anymore,” Chu Lingxi lowered her head and sighed.

While she was proud of Chu Feng’s accomplishment, she felt a little upset and it was no longer possible for her to catch up with Chu Feng.

“Silly girl. This is my gift for you!”

Chu Feng passed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Lingxi.

“My gosh! This… This is too valuable!”

Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan, and the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster were shocked to see the content of the Cosmos Sack. It was filled with potent cultivation resources, such that the items he had acquired from the Whitesky Star River and the Wretched Black Demon.

It had taken him quite a bit of effort to acquire those cultivation resources back then, but he was unable to use them right away due to the limitation of his cultivation. He was able to use them now, but the huge growth in his cultivation meant that these resources were no longer useful to him.

He thought that these cultivation resources would be put to much better use in Chu Lingxi’s hands. He had already removed whatever limitations that had been imposed on them, so she would be able to use them directly.

“This is too valuable! I can’t accept it!”

Chu Lingxi rejected the gift right away.

“Take it. They aren’t useful to me anymore,” Chu Feng said.

“Lass, you should just accept it. They might be valuable, but they aren’t useful to the current young hero Chu Feng anymore,” Shengguang Baimei advised.

“Then… I shan’t stand on ceremony.”

Chu Lingxi felt embarrassed, but she still accepted the Cosmos Sack. While it was no longer possible for her to catch up with Chu Feng, it didn’t mean that she was going to give up on her cultivation. These cultivation resources would raise her cultivation significantly if she put them to good use.

“Young friend Lingxi, you should have this too.”

Daoist Niantian passed a jade bottle to Chu Lingxi. It was filled with incredibly pure Niantian Energy.

“Elder, this is too much. I can’t take this!”

Similar to before, Chu Lingxi’s first reaction was to reject it.

“Take it. I prepared this for young friend Chu Feng, but he grew so quickly that it wasn’t useful to him anymore by the time I met him again. Since you’re his younger sister, there’s no one more apt to take it,” Daoist Niantian said.

“You should take it,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll take it then…” Chu Lingxi said hesitantly. There was a slight pause, but she couldn’t resist clarifying, “Elder, I’m actually older than Chu Feng. It’s just that we made a promise that whoever is stronger will be the older sibling, so… Haa!”

The crowd laughed upon hearing those words.

They finally understood why Chu Lingxi looked so troubled when Chu Feng called her ‘little sister’.
