Chapter 4631: The Old Man’s Aid

The golden flames were incredibly bizarre. They didn’t burn Chu Feng’s clothes nor his face, yet they placed him in great pain. Even in an unconscious state, he couldn’t help releasing pained groans. His face was scrunched up so tightly that one couldn’t help but wince just to imagine how much pain he was in.

“Damn it, what the hell is this?!”

Xiao Yu and Xia Yan could sense just how formidable the golden flames were. They tried several ways to extinguish the golden flames, but nothing was working at all.

This left them feeling incredibly anxious. They were afraid that Chu Feng would be burned to death under the effects of the golden flames.

...

Meanwhile, in Chu Feng’s mental world, he was still standing opposite the mysterious old man. His consciousness here was also being seared by the golden flames, and he was in great pain as well.

“Elder, I’m sincere about helping you. Why must you treat me in such a way?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Feng could feel the golden flames burning every inch of his soul, leaving him feeling utterly uneasy.

“Bear with it. I’m saving you here.”

After saying those words, the old man further intensified the golden flames, putting Chu Feng in greater pain.

But this time around, Chu Feng was no longer that worried anymore. He realized that despite the excruciating pain brought to him by the golden flames, they weren’t dealing any damage to him.

From the looks of it, it would appear that the old man was really helping him.

The golden flames continued burning for a long while, but it still showed no signs of extinguishing. On the contrary, the pain that Chu Feng was being put through was growing greater and greater.

However, the old man still remained completely unfazed. He continued eyeing Chu Feng calmly, as if trying to assess him.

Shoosh!

All of a sudden, the old man flung his sleeves, and the golden flames that were burning Chu Feng suddenly morphed into a golden glow. The golden glow flowed out from Chu Feng’s body into the sleeves of the old man.

Even though the golden flames had been put out, Chu Feng found that he was still in a frail state. Sweat droplets were raining from his head, and he found that he couldn’t even stand upright. With a loud thump, he fell limply to the ground.

“Elder, what did you do earlier?” Chu Feng asked feebly.

If he was still harboring any doubts previously, he was now certain that the old man didn’t intend him any harm. The golden flames might have vanished, but something was left in his body. He could sense that it was something that could indeed save his life.

However, Chu Feng also keenly noticed that the item left inside his body had nothing to do with the golden flames, which made him curious as to what the purpose of the golden flames was.

“You have grasped a portion of Thousand Transformations’ demonic power, but it isn’t as simple as you think it out to be. Tapping into its powers can indeed enhance your strength temporarily, but you’ll have to pay a price for it. You can think of it to be similar to forbidden medicine, but even worse. The side effects of forbidden medicine only lasts for a moment, but the effects of the Thousand Transformations’ demonic power lasts a lifetime.

“Earlier, when you ran out of spirit power, the Thousand Transformations’ demonic power made use of this opportunity to corrode your soul. If I hadn’t used the Demon Subjugating Divine Flame to exterminate the Thousand Transformations’ demonic power, you would have surely been unable to leave this place alive,” the old man told Chu Feng.

“Thousand Transformations’ demonic power? Is the power I’ve been tapping into not the power of the main formation of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace?” Chu Feng asked.

“It is, but the main formation here is not a normal formation. This Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace is under the control of the Thousand Transformations Fox Demon, so all of the formations in here are mixed with its demonic powers. Even though the Thousand Transformations Fox Demon is currently in hibernation, its powers still carry demonic properties,” the old man explained.

“In other words, it’s the Thousand Transformations Fox Demon who trapped you?” Chu Feng asked.

“You need not know too much about my affairs with the Thousand Transformations Fox Demon. You just need to remember to find me once you become a God-cloak World Spiritist. If you’re still willing to help me by then, I’ll surely thank you generously. Otherwise, I won’t blame you for it either,” the old man said.

“Elder, you have saved my life today. Please be assured that I’ll surely free you from your predicament once I become a God-cloak World Spiritist!” Chu Feng clasped his fist and said.

“Since that’s the case... I’ll look forward to that day then. Also, I noticed that you’ve obtained the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl. It might be yours now, but it won’t be easy for you to use it. Allow me to impart to you the way to activating it.”

The old man flicked his finger lightly, and the golden glow began to morph once more, forming a massive formation right before Chu Feng’s eyes. However, this massive formation swiftly compressed together to become incredibly small.

The way to activate the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl was extremely complicated, but Chu Feng was still able to recall it all with ease.

“Thank you, elder.”

Chu Feng was deeply grateful to the old man. He could tell that the method the old man had shown him was feasible. Had it not been for the old man’s pointer, it was difficult to say if he would have been able to figure it out on his own.

“Chu Feng, remember this. If you can’t come, so be it. I don’t like forcing anyone into anything. Alright, you may leave now.”

After saying those words, the old man flung his sleeves for one last time, and the space before Chu Feng began collapsing on its own, reducing into smithereens that rushed in his direction.

Seeing this, Chu Feng hurriedly shut his eyes. It was only when he felt that he was safe did he finally open them once more.

And as soon as he did, he realized that he was back in the real world.

Xia Yan and Xiao Yu were seated on his left and right respectively, seemingly guarding over him. His awakening brought looks of joy on their faces.

“Chu Feng, you’re awake! How are you feeling?”

Xia Yan and Xiao Yu asked at the same time.

“How am I feeling? Pretty good, I guess? “Chu Feng replied as he got back up.

“Really? There was a weird flame that suddenly blazed on your body. It really scared the both of us!” Xia Yan exclaimed.

“Ah, I’m aware of that. Don’t worry, I’m fine.”

Chu Feng wasn’t intending to tell Xia Yan and Xiao Yu about his encounter with the old man.

On the other hand, while Xia Yan and Xiao Yu were filled with questions about what had happened earlier, they were more concerned about Chu Feng’s safety. Since he was safe and sound now, they decided not to probe any deeper.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng took out the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl and began examining it. A look of excitement appeared on his face.

This treasure was actually useless to him, but it was extremely useful to world spirits. In fact, Chu Feng had a feeling that this item might just be able to wake Milady Queen up.
