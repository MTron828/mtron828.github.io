Chapter 5790: The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion Makes a Move

“He’s dead?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qin Xuan, Ling Xiao, and the others were conflicted to see Xianhai Shaoyu killing Huangfu Jiangyao just like that.

The talents and treasures of the five Huangfus showed that the Huangfu Heavenly Clan had a strong foundation. Offending such a power could result in terrifying consequences. Even though the Huangfus were the ones to first make an attempt on their lives, they were still unlikely to have dared to make such a move.

“How’s big brother?” Little Fishy also reached out to support Chu Feng.

Based on her observation, Chu Feng was only in a weakened state, but she was so worried about him that she wasn’t very confident in her own judgment.

“He’s fine. His earlier means probably just took a toll on him,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

He then turned his sight to Huangfu Shangyang, and the latter immediately raised his hands and surrendered, saying, “I am just a lackey. I never wanted to make an enemy out of you.”

“After all that has happened, do you think we’ll let you off scot-free?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“Yes, if you take my life, you can simply claim that we had all died in a trial. No one outside would be any wiser. If you spare me, you’d have to risk me reporting this to my clan. However, Xianhai Shaoyu, can you really trust the people around you? Are you going to silence them too?” Huangfu Shangyang said as he glanced at Long Chengyu, Ling Xiao, Yuwen Yanri, and the others.

“Xianhai Shaoyu, I won’t speak of this matter to anyone else,” Qin Xuan immediately made his promise.

“Stop trying to drive a wedge between us, Huangfu Shangyang,” Long Chengyu roared.

Huangfu Shangyang ignored their reprimand, focusing his attention on Xianhai Shaoyu instead. “Xianhai Shaoyu, you should be rather curious about our Huangfu Heavenly Clan. Why don’t we make an exchange? Spare my life, and I’ll tell you the circumstances surrounding our clan.”

“Speak,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Our Huangfu Heavenly Clan isn’t as powerful as you think. It’s just that the five of us are still decently talented, so it makes us look strong. The truth is that our elders are ailing in strength. We do have a strong foundation passed down from the Ancient Era, but our strength pales in contrast to the powerhouses of the current era,” Huangfu Shangyang said.

“Tell us about the Ancient Era. What happened back then? How is it that there are many restrictions imposed on those from the Ancient Era, but your Huangfu Heavenly Clan remains relatively free?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“Those are confidential secrets. Come over. I’ll only tell you,” Huangfu Shangyang said.

Shoosh!

Xianhai Shaoyu walked over and said, “Speak.”

Huangfu Shangyang’s murderous intent suddenly flared, and he raised his cultivation to its limit. However, blood splattered before he could make a move. He had been decapitated.

Xianhai Shaoyu had his guard up all this while. Upon noticing something was amiss, he didn’t hesitate to take Huangfu Shangyang’s life.

“This fellow sure is scheming!” Qin Xuan and the others remarked.

It was fortunate the one who went over was Xianhai Shaoyu. Had it been anyone else, Huangfu Shangyang might have just succeeded.

Xianhai Shaoyu waved his sleeves and stowed away all of the treasures from Huangfu Shangyang and Huangfu Jiangyao, though he refrained from taking the treasures dropped by Huangfu Shengyu.

“Brother Shaoyu, you’re more knowledgeable. Do you know what the red lightning Chu Feng exerted earlier is? How can he, with a cultivation of rank eight Half-God level, kill a rank one True God level cultivator?” Qin Xuan asked out of curiosity.

That was a question weighing on the minds of others too.

“My guess is that it’s a special bloodline means. The Huangfu Heavenly Clan’s God Taboo Martial Skills are related to the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, and it took a different form when Brother Chu Feng executed it after unleashing the red lightning.

“However, I reckon that Brother Chu Feng is the only one who can use it. It takes a powerful individual to unleash a powerful skill. Brother Chu Feng completely crushed Huangfu Shengyu in the bloodline dueling ring. While the fools from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan refused to accept reality, Brother Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline is clearly much stronger than Huangfu Shengyu’s by a huge margin. They aren’t on the same level.

“As powerful as Brother Chu Feng’s means are, his strength comes from within. It cannot be replicated by anyone else. It’s likely that others wouldn’t be able to unleash the means even if they somehow grasp hold of it,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“That’s true…”

The crowd agreed with Xianhai Shaoyu’s analysis, thinking that it made sense.

“My Brother Chu Feng is incredible,” Long Chengyu remarked.

“Brother Chu Feng’s father must be a top-notch expert, or else he wouldn’t have won Elder Jie Ranqing’s fancy. Only those who have their eyes blinded by bigotry can’t understand that much and think Lord Jie Ranqing had been taken advantage of.”

Xianhai Shaoyu glanced at Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao before adding, “I don’t mean to insult you, but there are really a lot of foolish people in your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. You should know that better than me.”

Neither Ling Xiao nor Jie Baobao answered.

Deep down, they knew Xianhai Shaoyu was right. If only the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion investigated the matter instead of jumping to the conclusion that both Chu Feng and his father were trash, they would have never landed in this awkward position.

Boom!

A loud rumble echoed from the sky.

Many powerful formations surged into the sky, converging to form a colossal formation. Several figures rushed into the sky to continue channeling the colossal formation.

The crowd was stunned.

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? What are they planning to do?” Long Chengyu and the others were intrigued.

“If the golden aura sealing off the surroundings is truly the legendary Genesis Bloodline, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s goal has to be that,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Qin Xuan and the others narrowed their eyes.

There was no one here who didn’t covet the Genesis Bloodline. Were it not out of fear for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, the other powers would have long made a move.

While the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, Divine Body Heavenly Mansion, Immortal Sea Fish Clan, and the other galaxy overlords appeared to be of the same standing, deep down, everyone understood that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was the strongest power at the moment.

All powerhouses had to first gauge the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s attitude before deciding their move.

This was evident in how the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion made its move before all of the powers gathered in Pulse Ignition Realm, but there was not a single person who dared to stand up to them. They could only watch helplessly as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion lay claim to that legendary power.
