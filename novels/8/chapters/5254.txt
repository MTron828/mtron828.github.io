Chapter 5254: The Real Chu Feng

The waiters soon returned with hundreds of boxes, which Chu Feng stuffed into his World Spirit Space. Then, he walked up to the two elders and swiped his hand across them.

“AH!”

The white-robed elder shrieked in agony.

Despite being still alive, Chu Feng was refining his body into origin energies! The screams only screeched to a halt after his body had completely broken down.

“You’re a guest of Treasure Hall?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right, I am!” the blue-robed man replied forcefully despite being frightened.

He thought that Chu Feng was afraid of Treasure Hall.

“Will Treasure Hall protect you?” Chu Feng asked.

“They definitely will! If you dare harm me, Treasure Hall will not… GAH!”

A sword had already pierced the bleu-robed elder’s dantian before he could finish his words. Chu Feng lifted the blue-robed elder up with his sword as if he was picking up something dirty before the two of them abruptly vanished into thin air.

Upon Chu Feng’s departure, the crowd turned to the middle-aged man and asked, “Boss, what do we do?”

“Let’s close the restaurant for the time being. Gather everyone. We’ll be heading to Treasure Hall!” the middle-aged man said.

…

Chu Feng had already arrived at Treasure Hall, but he didn’t show himself. Unlike the reckless man he used to be, he had cultivated the habit of scouting out his opponents before making a move.

He had amplified his hearing with a formation, allowing him to eavesdrop on conversations even across a barrier. There were many ongoing conversations in Treasure Hall, but he was able to swiftly organize and make sense of them.

Through these conversations, Chu Feng was able to quickly gain an understanding of Treasure Hall.

On the surface, Treasure Hall was similar to a sect that dealt with treasures. It had many elders and disciples under its command. However, the truth was that it was no different from a demonic cult.

Treasure Hall had branches throughout the True Dragon Starfield. They had been secretly capturing children who possessed Divine Powers or special bloodlines to train, enslaving them to serve their organization.

“Birds of the same feather flock together,” Chu Feng sneered.

He had searched the two elders’ possessions along the way and found that they were carrying spatial formations containing children with Divine Powers and monstrous beasts with unique bloodlines.

There were even newborns as well.

Chu Feng had already released those pitiful people, but it didn’t lessen Treasure Hall’s crimes in the least.

“Chu Feng, kill them all. No one from that Treasure Hall deserves to be spared,” Eggy said.

Eggy wasn’t a righteous person at heart. She was able to remain nonchalant to other people’s plight, and she wouldn’t hesitate to inflict pain on others either. Yet, she was angered by the deeds of Treasure Hall too.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already constructed a barrier around Treasure Hall, ready to begin his massacre.

“Hm?”

All of a sudden, a conversation in the innermost depth of Treasure Hall caught Chu Feng’s attention. It was between Treasure Hall’s sectmaster and vice sectmaster.

“I really envy them. How did they find a lady with dragon horns who isn’t affiliated with the Totem Dragon Clan? That’s worth a huge fortune!” Treasure Hall’s sectmaster remarked enviously.

“Indeed. I heard that it’s a pretty lass. She came to the Totem Galaxy to be treated for her illness, only to be caught by the Rain Hall,” the vice sectmaster replied.

“Chu Feng. A lady with dragon horns from another galaxy who is here to treat her illness. Why does that sound like Long Xiaoxiao to me?” Eggy said.

Chu Feng’s attention was piqued precisely because that description fitted Long Xiaoxiao’s profile.

“Those bastards!”

With a wave of his sleeves, Chu Feng threw something toward Treasure Hall’s central palace.

Boom!

The object pierced through the central palace’s barrier and penetrated its ceiling before finally falling flat in the middle of the palace.

“Who is it?”

The sectmaster and vice sectmaster were alarmed by the noise. The explosion caught the attention of the experts in Treasure Hall, who quickly rushed toward the central palace.

The sectmaster and vice sectmaster took a closer look and saw that the object was actually a person who had his cultivation crippled.

“This is… Brother Chen? What’s wrong, Brother Chen? Who crippled your cultivation?” Treasure Hall’s sectmaster rushed up to the blue-robed elder and anxiously asked.

“Sectmaster Sun, you must exact vengeance for me! The culprit is a little bastard from here!” the blue-robed elder cried indignantly.

“Brother Chen, is it a junior?” Treasure Hall’s sectmaster asked.

“Yes, it’s a junior,” the blue-robed elder replied.

“Does he carry the token of the Nether Hill Hall, Falling Flame Sect, or Wind Domain Valley?” Treasure Hall’s sectmaster asked.

Those were local powers that were stronger than Treasure Hall, and they had juniors who had the power to cripple the blue-robed elder’s cultivation. Treasure Hall wouldn’t dare to offend anyone from those powers.

“He doesn’t have any of their tokens,” the blue-robed elder replied.

“Rest assured, Brother Chen. I won’t allow anyone who dares to harm you on my turf get away scot-free. You can be certain that I’ll avenge you!” Treasure Hall’s sectmaster declared.

Uwa!

Another cry of agony echoed.

Before Treasure Hall’s sectmaster could walk out of the central palace, he suddenly felt a powerful pressure crushing down on him.

Boom!

The palace’s roof was suddenly sliced apart, allowing him to see the outside scenery without resorting to any special means. A young man was floating in the sky, releasing a barrage of sword qi with casual swings of his sword.

Just a single sword qi was already enough to slice through multiple palaces at once, and the young man was releasing multiple sword qi with each swing of his sword. In the blink of an eye, Treasure Hall was already utterly decimated.

The destruction of the buildings was a small matter, but countless elders and disciples had been massacred too.

The sectmaster and vice sectmaster took a closer look at the young man’s appearance, only to lurch in horror.

“Brother Chen, is he the man you have offended?” Treasure Hall’s sectmaster asked with a hoarse voice.

Treasure Hall was not a powerful organization, but it was extremely well-connected. Both the sectmaster and the vice sectmaster recognized the young man to be the culprit who had been massacring the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s branches.

Chu Feng!

“Yes, that’s the little bastard!” the blue-robed elder said.

“Were you the one who brought him here?”

The face of Treasure Hall’s sectmaster had turned completely livid by this point.

“That fool had the audacity to tell me to bring him here, so I did as he requested. Sectmaster Sun, that little bastard killed Brother Ouyang too. You have to avenge us!” the blue-robed elder cried.

“Avenge? Avenge your mum!”

The sectmaster took an Exalted Armament hammer and smashed the blue-robed elder into meat paste. The vice sectmaster also whipped out a spear and furiously stabbed the meat paste. They felt like their blood was boiling in their veins.

This fool actually lured the demon right into their base!

At this point, there was no one in the True Dragon Starfield who didn’t know who Chu Feng was. Even the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen had deserted their clan just to escape from him!

This was definitely not someone whom they could offend!

They knew right away that they were doomed today, and it was all the blue-robed elder’s fault! Right after they killed the blue-robed elder, the crowd quickly kneeled down.

“Young hero Chu Feng, even though I am acquainted with this guy, we aren’t close at all! His deeds have nothing to do with us. I beg you to have mercy and spare us!” Treasure Hall’s sectmaster pleaded.

By then, Chu Feng had already utterly destroyed Treasure Hall, not just the buildings but the thirty million people in the organization too. The only survivors were the sectmaster and vice sectmaster.

Chu Feng turned his attention to the vice sectmaster and saw that he was a rank six Martial Exalted level cultivator.

The vice sectmaster dared not to look Chu Feng in the eye. Upon sensing Chu Feng’s gaze, he hurriedly kowtowed in hopes of placating his rage.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng sliced him into two with a single slash.

“Young hero Chu Feng, please spare my life!”

Seeing how easily his vice sectmaster was killed, the rank seven Martial Exalted level sectmaster didn’t dare to fight back at all. He kowtowed and begged for mercy. Despite his advanced age, he still peed his pants out of fear.

It was only to be expected. There were humans who remained afraid of death no matter how old they were.

“You said that you know someone who captured a woman with dragon horns. Draw that woman out for me,” Chu Feng ordered.

“I-I only heard rumors. I didn’t see the woman… But I know who captured her and where she is! Young hero Chu Feng, I can bring you to her!” Treasure Hall’s sectmaster cried.

Chu Feng waved his sleeves.

A powerful suction force stirred up a storm in Treasure Hall. Countless treasures flew into Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack whereas the origin energies were absorbed by Eggy. By the time the storm finally dissipated, both Chu Feng and Treasure Hall’s sectmaster were nowhere to be seen.

Some time later, the manager of Immortal Bun Pavilion and his staff finally arrived at Treasure Hall. The middle-aged man noticed that Chu Feng wasn’t afraid of Treasure Hall, so he suspected that the latter had headed here.

He wanted to see if Chu Feng could deal with Treasure Hall by himself.

If Chu Feng was able to settle Treasure Hall, the Immortal Bun Pavilion would be safe from this ordeal. Otherwise, the manager would have to flee right away together with his staff.

He was shocked when he saw a completely devastated Treasure Hall. He could tell that it hadn’t been long since Treasure Hall was wrecked. As he walked closer, he saw countless corpses lying all over the place.

The frightening sight left the waitresses screaming in horror and the waiters trembling in fear.

“Boss, did the young hero do this?” the waiter who had welcomed Chu Feng at the entrance asked the middle-aged man.

“Are you certain that the young hero bears a resemblance to Chu Feng?” the middle-aged man asked.

“They don’t just bear a resemblance. They look identical to each other,” the waiter replied.

“Hu…” The middle-aged man exhaled deeply before saying, “It looks like we have met the real deal.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Those words shocked the crowd. They had actually met the real Chu Feng?!?!

“Was that really young hero Chu Feng? My gosh, I met my idol but I actually… Hai!”

The waiter regretfully lowered his head. It was his deep respect for Chu Feng that compelled him to fork out an exorbitant sum to obtain the latter’s wanted portrait.

“At least you got to speak with him. We didn’t even have a chance to talk to him. I’m envious of you,” another waiter said.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan had committed so many atrocities that hardly anyone in the True Dragon Starfield saw them in a positive light. It was just that no one had the strength to go up against them. What Chu Feng did was something they had been wanting to do but couldn’t.

Most of the waiters actually carried some level of respect for Chu Feng.

“Still, don’t you think that it’s too much for him to massacre them just like that? Is there really a need to go this far?” one of the waitresses cried out.

It was not that she was cowardly but that the sight before her was simply too shocking. Furthermore, she wasn’t aware of the evil deeds Treasure Hall had committed in the shadows, so she naturally thought that Chu Feng had gone too far.

“I can’t deny that it’s cruel, but that’s just how Chu Feng is like,” the middle-aged man said.

“No, I think that there must be a reason behind young hero Chu Feng’s actions. Just think about those two elders we met earlier on. I doubt that Treasure Hall is anything good if they have associated themselves with people like that,” the waiter said.

The other waiters nodded in agreement. Even the middle-aged man thought that there was some sense to it.

“Boss, can we return now?” someone asked.

They felt that they could go back to running their Immortal Bun Pavilion now that Treasure Hall had been destroyed.

“We can’t do that anymore,” the middle-aged man shook his head and replied. “The person whom we have met is the real Chu Feng. Others will soon connect the dot too, especially after he had massacred everyone in Treasure Hall. Others might suspect that we’re acquainted with Chu Feng after how he had saved us earlier. This might bring the Situ World Spiritist Clan upon us. Return home and gather your family members. We’ll leave this place right away!”

The crowd thought that the middle-aged man’s words made sense, so they hurriedly scattered to make preparations to escape.
