Chapter 2794 - Clones Teleportation Talisman

“You!!!” Hearing those words, Yuwen Hualong was so furious his face turned green.

“This is clear discrimination in favor of Chu Feng! Exactly what sort of relationship do you all have with Chu Feng?! Why are you all helping him like this?!” Yuwen Hualong spoke with fuming rage between gritted teeth.

“Helping him? When have we ever helped him? We have never helped anyone.”

“The world of martial cultivators is a cruel one to begin with. It is inevitable that one will encounter dangers after choosing to enter the mountain. It was Yuwen Tingyi’s own decision to enter the mountain. As such, he should assume responsibility for what might happen to him.”

“Furthermore, when Yuwen Tingyi captured Li Xiang and crippled Li Xiang’s cultivation, we also didn’t step forth to do anything.”

“If we were to do things according to your logic, would we not also be shielding Yuwen Tingyi?” That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder asked.

“You!!!” Yuwen Hualong started to shiver with anger. However, he had no idea how to refute him. After all, what he said seemed to really be reasonable. It was true that when Yuwen Tingyi crippled Li Xiang’s cultivation, the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan did not interfere.

“Furthermore, Chu Feng appeared to save Li Xiang. Even in the battle between Yuwen Tingyi and Chu Feng, it was Yuwen Tingyi who unleashed his killing intent first. He was also the first one to attack. If it wasn’t for him looking for trouble first, such a thing wouldn’t have happened.”

“Thus, to speak of it bluntly, Yuwen Tingyi’s current state was brought forth by himself,” That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder said.

“You are fucking spouting bullshit!!!”

Hearing those words, Yuwen Hualong, who was feeling extremely furious to begin with, suddenly exploded with rage. He actually raised his hand and shot forth a punch. That punch was aimed at that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder.

However, while Yuwen Hualong was a renowned genius among the younger generation, it remained that he was only a member of the younger generation, only a True Immortal-level expert.

As for that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder, he was an actual Heavenly Immortal-level expert. As such, how could Yuwen Hualong possibly match up to him?

Before Yuwen Hualong’s punch could even land, that elder raised his hand, and a burst of wind emerged, blowing Yuwen Hualong far away.

When Yuwen Hualong landed, his face was covered with a frightened expression.

He had been unable to contain his state of mind because of how furious he was earlier. However, after that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder unleashed his attack, Yuwen Hualong sensed killing intent.

Thus, Yuwen Hualong was currently shivering. Even though he was not injured, he was deeply frightened by his opponent’s terrifying power.

“Where did you take this place to be? You actually dared to attack this old man?”

“Today, I will take into consideration that your state of mind was unstable due to your friend’s cultivation being crippled and not look further into this matter.”

“However, if you dare to act recklessly again, do not blame me for taking your life.”

At that moment, that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder was staring at Yuwen Hualong with a stern expression.

As the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen were not humans and possessed fierce and tough appearances to begin with, that Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder looked quite frightening after becoming angry.

At that moment, it was not only Yuwen Hualong that didn’t dare to utter another word. The others present also did not dare to utter another word.

At that moment, the plaza had grown very quiet.

“Senior, can one return to the mountain through the light pillars?”

Right at that moment, Han Yu spoke. His words shattered the silence.

“They can. What about it?” That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder asked in an ill-intended manner. It could be seen that this elder had also heard about Han Yu. Thus, he deeply disliked him.

“Can I go in?” Han Yu asked.

“You are not qualified to enter,” That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder said.

Han Yu reacted as if he had anticipated those words. Not only was he not angry, but he instead continued to ask, “Then, I wish to ask, can Yuwen Hualong enter?”

“He is qualified to enter the mountain. If he is willing, he will naturally be able to enter,” That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder said.

“In that case, if Yuwen Hualong is to return to the mountain, find Chu Feng there and then cripple his cultivation or even killed him, would you all not interfere?” Han Yu asked.

Hearing those words, the people from the Sacred Pellet Villa and the Immortal Armament Villa immediately started to frown.

They’d realized Han Yu’s intention. At that moment, they were unable to contain themselves from exclaiming in their hearts over how treacherous Han Yu was.

That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s elder had a disapproving expression, and said indifferently, “Regardless of who it might be, if anyone is to fight inside the mountain, our Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan will not interfere. Merely, as that spirit formation maze is still present, I’m afraid that he will not be able to find Chu Feng even if he is to return.”

“Senior does not have to worry about that,” The corners of Han Yu’s mouth were raised into a sneering smile. Then, he walked over to Yuwen Hualong.

Han Yu took out a case from his Cosmos Sack.

The case was very exquisite. There were spirit formation symbols and runes engraved on its surface. Not only were the symbols and runes very orderly, but they were even flickering slightly as they moved up and down.

Han Yu handed the case to Yuwen Hualong. He said, “Brother Hualong, due to the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan deliberately making things difficult for me, I am unable to enter the mountain to find that Chu Feng to avenge brother Tingyi.”

“But brother Tingyi’s vengeance must be obtained. You will have to be the one to shoulder this heavy responsibility.”

Yuwen Tingyi hurriedly got up and received Han Yu’s case. Upon opening the case, his eyes immediately shrunk. Astonishment appeared in his wide-open eyes.

There was only a single paper talisman inside that exquisite case. That paper talisman was light blue in color. However, it was emitting layer upon layer of light that flickered nonstop. Even though it was only a paper talisman, it resembled countless paper talismans. Its appearance was truly miraculous.

“Clone Teleportation Talisman!!!”

Suddenly, an elder from the Immortal Armament Villa cried out in shock.

Hearing those words, the expressions of many of the people present changed. They were all shocked.

They were shocked at Han Yu giving such a treasure to Yuwen Hualong. It would appear that Han Yu truly hated Chu Feng bitterly.

At that moment, the people from the Immortal Armament Villa and the Sacred Pellet Villa all revealed worried expressions.

They were all worried for Chu Feng.

That Clone Teleportation Talisman was extremely precious.

Otherwise, Han Yu wouldn’t have only taken it out after Yuwen Tingyi’s cultivation had been crippled by Chu Feng instead of taking it out and handing it to Yuwen Hualong from the very beginning.

The reason why the Clone Teleportation Talisman was so precious was because it was something that only Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritists and above could refine. Furthermore, it was something that required a lot of time to refine.

That said, those were not the reasons why the people from the Immortal Armament Villa and the Sacred Pellet Villa were so worried.

They were worried for Chu Feng because of the Clone Teleportation Talisman’s special usage.

There were two uses for the Clone Teleportation Talisman.

Firstly, it was capable of allowing one to create multiple clones within a certain period of time. One would be able to control all of those clones at once.

Of course, the strength of those clones would not be comparable to one’s actual body. Furthermore, the range at which one could control one’s clones was also limited.

However, that range would be more than sufficient to cover the entire mountain.

As for the other use of the Clone Teleportation Formation, it was the fact that one’s actual body could teleport to the location of any single clone.

Thus, the Clone Teleportation Formation could be said to be one of the best treasure-searching methods to use in a special region. Of course, if one was to use it to search for someone within a certain place, it would also be very effective.

Should Yuwen Hualong use the Clone Teleportation Formation, even though the mountain was a maze, it would not be difficult for Yuwen Hualong to find Chu Feng. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Although, due to the restriction caused by the maze, Yuwen Hualong would not be able to enter Buried Spirit Lake regardless of how many clones he might have, he could have those clones guard all of the pillars to the mountain’s exit.

Using this waiting method, he could wait for Chu Feng’s arrival.

Under these circumstances, how could the people from the Immortal Armament Villa and the Sacred Pellet Villa not feel worried for Chu Feng?
