Chapter 3567 - The Other Method

After confronting one another for some time, Chu Feng’s face had turned pale, and was covered in sweat.

Everyone could tell that he was exhausting himself by controlling that mysterious power. They knew that it was not easy for him to control it.

With the situation being like that, the crowd were truly unable to help but worry.

They were in a great panic. They were extremely afraid that Chu Feng would not be able to last.

After all, compared to the pale-faced Chu Feng, one could not see any trace of change to the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief, who was wearing a black cloak.

To them, the current situation was extremely bad.

“Step, step, step~~~”

Suddenly, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief took several steps back, and fell powerlessly onto his butt.

“This!!!”

It was only at that moment that the crowd came to a sudden realization that the situation was not easy on the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief either. It was only due to the black cloak that the crowd were unable to see his current weary appearance.

Furthermore, at the instant when the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief fell, those that were suppressed by his oppressive might and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Tantai Yinjian, who were suppressed by the power of the Void Sacred Tree, all managed to regain the ability to move.

This made the crowd feel that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief seemed to be in an even worse condition than Chu Feng.

“Putt~~~”

However, after the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief sat on the ground, Chu Feng also sat on the ground, and began to pant violently. Even his body was trembling slightly. One could tell that he was truly exhausted.

“Is it a tie?”

Although the crowd had regained their freedom, no one dared to act blindly without thinking.

They continued to examine Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Sure enough, you’re as thorny as you’re rumored to be.”

The Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief spoke. His voice was very weak. That said, his tone seemed to be slightly praising Chu Feng.

After he finished saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Tantai Yinjian and the others, “Are you all not ashamed? You’ve lived for so long, yet in the end, you need to be protected by a person of the younger generation.”

His tone was filled with mockery.

“This old man does not feel ashamed to be protected by Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” Tantai Yinjian said with a beaming smile. There was not only no trace of shame on his face, but he instead had a slight look of complacence.

“Humph, you’re shameless enough.”

The Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief was very surprised by Tantai Yinjian’s response. Because of that, he snorted in a very displeased manner.

“Senior, using that power is quite taxing on us. If we are to continue to fight like this, we will both die,” said Chu Feng.

“If I am to die, will you spare my clansmen?”

“If you really can’t spare them, can you at least spare those three?”

“Those three children were not originally part of our clan. They should not be carrying our burden,” the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Chu Feng felt extremely shocked upon hearing those words.

The reason why the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen showed no fear in the face of death was because they had decided to give their all for their great undertaking.

The Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief, as the leader of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan, should not have been willing to let himself be killed so easily.

Yet, he made precisely such a decision. He was willing to use his death in exchange for the lives of Zhang Yanfeng and his two siblings.

Chu Feng knew that Zhang Yanfeng and his two siblings were very important to the Blood-devouring Demon Clan. Merely, he did not imagine that their importance would reach such a degree.

He did not expect that their importance actually surpassed that of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief!!!

This caused Chu Feng to once again have a whole new opinion of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan.

Even though they were a demon clan, their manner of conduct was worthy of his admiration.

“You all should’ve suffered a lot of casualties in this endeavor. However, it seems like you have not killed anyone, no?” Chu Feng asked.

“Our clan has always been cautious when carrying out our mission. That’s even more so when it’s a mission personally ordered by me.”

“Since I demanded that all the captives must be brought back alive, my clansmen will naturally not kill anyone,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Since you did not kill anyone, why would I seek to kill you?” asked Chu Feng.

“You’re not planning to kill us?” The Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief felt very surprised.

It was not only him; the others present were also very surprised.

“Young friend Chu Feng.”

Immediately, someone called out to Chu Feng. Likely, that person wanted to urge Chu Feng to kill the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

However, right after that person and others like him opened their mouths, Tantai Yinjian raised his hand to indicate to them to not interrupt.

Seeing that, the people that wanted to advise Chu Feng against it all closed their mouths. After all, Tantai Yinjian possess a very high status, and a great amount of authority.

“Since you have not killed any of my clansmen, why would I kill you?” Chu Feng asked again.

“Interesting. Brat, go on, tell me what you want,” The Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“You all have likely not come here with the intention to unleash a massacre, no? You merely wanted to enter the Sacred Palace Hall, isn’t that right?”

“From that aspect, our goal is actually the same,” said Chu Feng.

“If one wishes to enter the Sacred Palace Hall, one must use the souls of martial cultivators as the price. Apart from that...” When his words reached that point, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief’s voice turned to one of shock. “Could it be, you want to attempt that method?!”

“To use another’s soul as the price, even if one could enter the Sacred Palace Hall, one’s conscience would not be at ease. Likely, one would not be able to obtain Lord Qin Kunlun’s approval either.”

“Rather than that, it is better to use our own abilities to enter the Sacred Palace Hall,” said Chu Feng.

“No, that’s absolutely impossible,” The Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head.

“You’re not even afraid of death, why do you fear giving it a try?” asked Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly grew quiet.

“Senior, you are evidently not one to be afraid of death. You must be worried about Zhang Yanfeng and his two siblings, right?” Chu Feng asked.

The Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief did not answer Chu Feng. However, he also did not refute him. His behavior was akin to a quiet acknowledgement.

“The path of martial cultivation is a path going against the current. Dangers are unavoidable.”

“Furthermore, the three of them carry with them the heavy responsibility of carrying on your Blood-devouring Demon Clan. If they do not even possess that bit of courage, they will likely not be able to obtain greatness in the future.”

“Should that be the case, I believe that they would not be qualified for you to place such enormous hope on them, no?” asked Chu Feng.

“Brat, you’re quite smooth with your words,” the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“What I said is merely the truth. I believe that my words must’ve reached senior’s heart too. How about this: they can decide their own fate. I will ask them if they’re willing to attempt it or not.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve upward. A ray of light immediately flew out from his sleeve, flying up ahead.

The item that flew out from Chu Feng’s sleeve started to rapidly enlarge. It was none other than the cage that had imprisoned Zhang Yanfeng and the other Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

“Lord Clan Chief, we are willing to try.”

“This subordinate is willing to give it a try.”

The people inside the cage, including the three siblings, all got on one knee and spoke in unison.

Evidently, they had heard all of the conversation earlier. Thus, they had already prepared their answer.

Seeing that, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief sighed. Then, he removed the hood on his head and revealed his true appearance.

Like the other Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief had blue skin covered in crimson vein lines. From a glance, he appeared very terrifying, and resembled a monster.

Furthermore, he was very thin. Compared to the other Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, he looked like an extremely fragile and weak old man. That being said, he still emitted the aura of a ruler. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Since as that’s the case, let’s give it a try ,” After he finished saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief turned his eyes to Tantai Yinjian and the others, “Whilst our clan does not fear death, I do not know if they would dare to give it a try."

The crowd were all confused by the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief’s gaze.

However, they were able to faintly feel that what they were going to do was very dangerous.
