Chapter 2835 - The Rumors Cannot Be Trusted

Chu Feng continued onward. Finally, he saw the so-called Void Sacred Tree.

Even though there was still a very large distance between them, the Void Sacred Tree had entered Chu Feng’s field of view.

That tree was growing out of thin air and in the void. However, it was simply too enormous, and pierced through the clouds.

It was as if it were an enormous tree growing above the clouds. However, this tree was simply a bit too enormous.

Chu Feng estimated that the ordinary trunk-like branches of the tree were a kilometer thick and over a hundred kilometers in length.

As for its main trunk, its size was inestimable. From this, one could imagine exactly what sort of huge monster that tree was.

However, apart from its enormous size and having a whole lot of main branches and vines, the appearance of the tree was not very special. Not only did the tree not emit any sort of light, but even the colors of its leaves and branches were very ordinary.

However, outside the Void Sacred Tree was a spirit formation visible to the naked eye.

That spirit formation was light green in color. It enveloped the entire Void Sacred Tree.

Overall, that Void Sacred Tree was like Chu Feng had imagined it to be.

The only exception was that Chu Feng had originally expected various powers to surround the outside of the Void Sacred Tree.

However, upon arriving, he discovered that there were not as many people around the Void Sacred Tree as he had anticipated.

In fact, Chu Feng was able to see many people and many powers proceeding in the opposite direction. They were leaving the Void Sacred Tree.

Furthermore, Chu Feng was even hearing swearing from the people that were leaving and passing by him. They seemed to be cursing someone.

Upon making inquiries, Chu Feng discovered that the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan had actually also arrived during the time when he was trapped in the illusion.

The people from the Chu Heavenly Clan had used special methods, but were still unable to find the person that was said to be in the Void Sacred Tree.

In fact, they were unable to find the slightest clue.

Furthermore, it was unknown where the information stating that there was someone inside the Void Sacred Tree originated from.

Because of that, the Chu Heavenly Clan determined that the rumors of there being someone in the Void Sacred Tree were just that; merely a rumor.

Once the Chu Heavenly Clan made that determination, the various powers all felt it to be very trustworthy. They began to firmly believe that the rumors from before were merely rumors.

Because of that, the various powers all began to leave.

The people that remained were all people that had just arrived and didn’t know about what had happened. As a result, there would naturally be a lot less people than expected.

“Even the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Ruler has come? That should be the strongest expert of the Starfall Holy Land, no?”

“This is truly a pity. We actually missed the scene of all those grand characters gathering in one place,” Her Lady Queen spoke with slight disappointment.

From the conversations of the crowd, Her Lady Queen and Chu Feng found out that there were a lot of grand characters that had arrived at the Void Sacred Tree this time around.

Those people could be said to be peak characters in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Unfortunately, before Chu Feng could see them, they’d already left.

“It is better that they’ve left. Otherwise, with their strength, they would likely be able to see through my disguise with a single glance. I would have no idea if that would be a blessing or a calamity,” Chu Feng said.

“It’s not like there are any grudges between them and you. I don’t think they’d make things difficult for you, no?” Her Lady Queen said.

“Who knows?” Chu Feng said with a faint smile.

At that moment, Chu Feng proceeded closer to the Void Sacred Tree. The reason why he insisted on visiting this place was because Chu Feng was practically certain that it was not a rumor, but rather something that had actually happened.

If it were a rumor, how could someone be able to describe Wang Qiang’s appearance with such accuracy?

Thus, it must be real. Merely, no one knew where Wang Qiang was hiding.

That being said, Chu Feng still wanted to attempt searching for Wang Qiang. Perhaps Wang Qiang might leave him some sort of clue.

Chu Feng searched around the Void Sacred Tree from outside the spirit formation. After doing so for a while, he also returned empty-handed.

He was unable to find any trace of Wang Qiang by inspecting the outside of the Void Sacred Tree. In fact, he was unable to even find the slightest bit of a clue.

However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng was still unwilling to leave. He still held hope in his heart.

The reason for that was because the spirit formation surrounding the Void Sacred Tree was not only capable of preventing others from entering it, but it was also capable of obstructing various detection methods. As such, spirit formations were all useless against it.

Because of that, Chu Feng was simply unable to see the complete situation inside the Void Sacred Tree. No matter how he tried to look at it, he would only be able to see the outside portion.

Observing it like this would mean that there would always be places that would be blocked by the tree trunk, the branches or the vines.

Chu Feng was unwilling to give up because he heard that the Void Sacred Tree would shift every once in a while.

It was not that the Void Sacred Tree itself that would shift. Rather, it was the tree trunk that would shift.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that it might be that the clues Wang Qiang left behind were obstructed by the Void Sacred Tree’s branches or vines after it shifted. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

That was the reason why Chu Feng wanted to continue waiting.

While Chu Feng was waiting for the Void Sacred Tree to shift, a group of men and women flew over while chatting and laughing with one another loudly.

They stopped at a location not far away from Chu Feng.

They were most likely all disciples from a certain power. The reason for that was because they were all wearing the same outfit. Furthermore, their age difference was not very great either.

They were all within three hundred years of age. In fact, some among them were people of the younger generation.

As for their appearance, they all had appearances of young men and women. Not only were their appearances youthful, but inexperience could also be seen in their gazes.

Those people were most definitely flowers grown in a greenhouse. Although their ages were much older than Chu Feng, they had most definitely not experienced as much as he had.

That was the reason why they would be so inexperienced and naive like young men and women at their age.

When that group of disciples arrived, they all started sighing at missing the opportunity to witness those grand characters.

Actually, Chu Feng had heard this sort of sighing countless times after he arrived at the Void Sacred Tree.

Chu Feng was not interested in people voicing their lament at missing an opportunity. They were all like wind to his ears, entering one ear and leaving the other.

However, the topic of conversation from this group of disciples actually managed to catch Chu Feng’s attention.

The reason for that was because they were discussing him.

“Have you all heard of it? That Chu Feng is simply too powerful. After he left the Immortal Armament Villa, he actually proceeded for the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. At the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain, only he, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Lingxi, only the three of them, managed to enter Buried Spirit Lake. Furthermore, all three of them managed to break through and become Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.”

“Not only that, that Chu Feng actually ended up crippling Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong’s cultivations just because of a disagreement with them. He is simply too arrogant and tyrannical.”

“In fact, even the demon-level genius on the Demon-level Geniuses List, Han Yu, was defeated by Chu Feng.”

“Heavens! That Chu Feng is simply too powerful. He is simply my emperor ordained by the heavens, the eternal idol of I, Song Hua’er,” A female disciple spoke of what Chu Feng had done with a smitten appearance.

“Of course I’ve heard about it. I’ve heard that Chu Feng is extremely tyrannical. Even an existence like that Han Yu was unable to withstand three moves from Chu Feng before being defeated.”

“That Chu Feng’s strength is simply unfathomable. Likely, very few people from the younger generation in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would be able to contend against him.”

“That’s a given. The way I see it, it’s not that very few people would be able to contend against him, there is simply no one that can contend against him. That Chu Feng is simply the most powerful member of the younger generation in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm right now. There is no one that could compare to him.”

“Amazing, I truly wonder what the origin of that Chu Feng is.”

It was not only the female disciples. Even the male disciples were praising Chu Feng nonstop when they spoke of him.

They were reacting as if they were Chu Feng’s believers. Their praises toward Chu Feng could be said to be filled with admiration. They were simply trying to praise Chu Feng all the way to the heavens.

Being praised by them in such a manner, Chu Feng’s face grew slightly red.

The match between him and Han Yu was clearly a bitter struggle. How did it become him defeating Han Yu easily when it reached the mouths of these people?

Gossip was truly a fearful thing. For some rumors, one could not trust them.

“Humph, what you’ve all heard was merely false information. Chu Feng is simply not as powerful as you all have declared him to be.”

Right at that moment, a male disciple with a face filled with pockmarks spoke in a very disdainful manner.
