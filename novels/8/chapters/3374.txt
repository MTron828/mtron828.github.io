Chapter 3374 - The Structure Of The Ancestral Martial Starfield

“This junior has only recently returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield, thus, I do not know much about matters in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Senior, could you please explain it to me?” Chu Feng said.

“That Nine Dragons Upper Realm is extremely extraordinary. It is the Upper Realm ruled by the second ranked of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, the Tantai Heavenly Clan,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s gaze changed slightly. Ranked second among the Ten Great Heavenly Clans. In other words, in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, amongst heavenly clans the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s strength was weaker than only the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

As for Chu Feng, he had heard from Li Ruochu that the Linghu Heavenly Clan was planning to overthrow the Starfield Master Realm, and seize their position of overlord.

For the Linghu Heavenly Clan to possess such ambition, one could imagine how powerful they were.

With how powerful the Linghu Heavenly Clan was, even if the Tantai Heavenly Clan was weaker than the Linghu Heavenly Clan, they couldn’t be that much weaker. As such, they were definitely very powerful too.

“Senior, what are you and Wuma Shengjie going there for?” Chu Feng asked.

“Although the younger generations of the Starfield Master Realm will not involve themselves in the contest for the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, they are the ones who will preside over their selection.”

“This year, the location where the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars will be held is none other than the Nine Dragons Upper Realm,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Hearing this, Chu Feng understood what was going on. Wuma Shengjie was planning to participate in the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

Chu Feng took a glance at Wuma Shengjie. He thought in his heart, ‘If this girl is to join, the rankings of the Ancestral Martial Decastars will definitely change.’

Sensing Chu Feng’s gaze, Wuma Shengjie asked in a haughty manner, “Why are you looking at me like that?”

“I am feeling joy for you upon thinking that you will be able to demonstrate your extraordinary talent soon,” Chu Feng said.

“Tsk~” Wuma Shengjie cast a side-eye at Chu Feng and said no more.

Chu Feng was not angry at Wuma Shengjie’s behavior. After all, that girl was trying to kill him the last time they met. Her behavior at that moment was already extremely good by comparison.

After all, he had witnessed what he should not have.

“In that case, senior, can we set off right away?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course, of course we can. Chu Feng, let us set off immediately,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the grand clan chief of a clan, was acting like an old servant of a young master toward Chu Feng. His attitude was extremely good.

Seeing their Lord Clan Chief treating Chu Feng, a member of the younger generation, in such a manner, not a single person in the Wuma Heavenly Clan felt uncomfortable, nor did they have any objection to it.

After all, Chu Feng was their savior. The grace that he had shown them was something that they, the Wuma Heavenly Clan, could not repay. So what if their Lord Clan Chief was extra courteous toward him? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Upon deciding the matter, the three immediately set off for the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

En route, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked, “Young friend Chu Feng, are you not planning to participate in the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars?”

The reason he asked that was because Chu Feng did not know about the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. This meant that he must not know about the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

“I originally did not plan to. However, since we’re going to the Nine Dragons Upper Realm now, I have no idea what will happen. I guess I’ll just allow fate to run its course,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“If you’re able to participate, it would be best to participate. With your strength of a rank five Martial Immortal, you will definitely be able to defeat a great amount of opponents. You might even be able to obtain third place among the Ancestral Martial Decastars.”

“At that time, not only will your name be known throughout the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but it will also benefit your Chu Heavenly Clan,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

As Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation, neither the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief or Wuma Shengjie knew that Chu Feng’s actual cultivation was that of a rank seven Martial Immortal.

“My main purpose is removing my big sister Liluo’s seal. If there is enough time after removing her seal, I will likely participate,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, for you to call that little lady big sister, could she be older than you?” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief revealed his curiosity toward Bai Liluo.

It was not only him. When Bai Liluo was mentioned, Wuma Shengjie also cast curious eyes toward him.

“I do not know exactly how old big sister Liluo is. We met by chance. However, she treated me very well. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have agreed to come here with me,” Chu Feng said.

“That little lady is truly extraordinary. Young friend Chu Feng, you are truly one with great luck with women. You actually know so many extraordinary women,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief gasped in admiration. Even now, he could not forget about Su Rou and Su Mei, who had appeared in the Ancient Era’s remnant.

After Su Rou and Su Mei, Bai Liluo appeared.

All the people Chu Feng knew were experts. Furthermore, they were all beauties.

Chu Feng coughed, “Great luck with women? Senior, what are you... my big sister Liluo is still only a child.” He felt very embarrassed.

“Haha. A slip of the tongue. That said, after this little lady grows up, she will definitely become an exceptional beauty,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“But...” Chu Feng wanted to explain.

However, before he could explain, Wuma Shengjie interrupted him, “But what? What my clan chief said is correct. Why is it that all the ones that help you are women? Don’t you know?”

“Eh... regarding this... Senior Wuma, can you explain the current structure of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to me?” Chu Feng hurriedly shifted the topic.

That said, although this was a shift of topic, it was actually also something that Chu Feng was interested in knowing.

Since the Nine Dragons Upper Realm was the location for the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, there were most definitely experts from various parties gathered there. As such, it was essential that Chu Feng know about the strengths of the various powers.

“Of course. That’s no issue at all.”

After saying that, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief began to explain the current structure of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to Chu Feng.
