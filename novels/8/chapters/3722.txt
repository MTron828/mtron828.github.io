Chapter 3722 - Linxi’s Parents

“Lingxi, you shouldn’t put too much hope in something like fusing with Divine Power,” Gu Mingyuan said to Chu Lingxi.

Seeing how joyous and excited Chu Lingxi was, she did not attempt to expose the Ox-nosed Old Daoist as a scam.

However, she was still afraid that Chu Lingxi would be disappointed from failing to fuse with the Divine Power. Thus, she decided to warn her to not put too much hope into it.

“Mother, I know it will be very difficult. However... I will definitely do my best,” said Chu Lingxi.

“Well then, Chu Feng, Chu Lingxi, the two of you can come in now.”

Soon, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice was heard.

Hearing his voice, Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi did not hesitate, and both flew into the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s palace.

After entering the palace, Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi discovered that, although the palace was very big, there were only two bath tub like items and nothing else inside.

Furthermore, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was nowhere to be seen.

That said, deep in the palace hall was a door. Likely, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was on the other side of the door.

“Wait a moment, this old man still needs to make some more preparations.”

Sure enough, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice was heard from behind the door.

“Chu Feng, did I cause trouble for you again?” Chu Lingxi asked Chu Feng.

“What do you mean by that?” asked Chu Feng.

“It’s about me challenging Linghu Hongfei,” said Chu Lingxi.

“Foolish girl, you were standing up for me, I am more than grateful for what you’ve done; how could it be causing trouble for me?” said Chu Feng.

“But, if I didn’t insist on standing up for you, you all wouldn’t have had to brave such dangers,” said Chu Lingxi.

“Perhaps this is fate. Did you know, I’ve been searching for this senior Daoist the entire time. However, I had been unable to find him. Never did I expect to encounter him in the Mirror Sea.”

“If I didn’t come to the Mirror Sea, I might not have been able to find him in my whole life.”

“Say, is this not fate?” asked Chu Feng.

“If you say it like that, you’ll have to thank me then." Chu Lingxi spoke with a beaming smile.

“Indeed, I will really have to thank you.” Chu Feng also smiled. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, Chu Feng soon looked to the outside of the palace.

At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu had also unleashed his spirit power to create a palace.

Chu Feng saw that Grandmaster Liangqiu, Chu Xuanzhengfa and Gu Mingyuan had all entered that palace.

Grandmaster Liangqiu went to his own room to rest.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was attempting to talk with Gu Mingyuan. Likely, he must be trying to understand something.

However, he was met with indifference by Gu Mingyuan.

She remained extremely cold toward Chu Xuanzhengfa.

However, when Chu Xuanzhengfa stopped that spirit formation gate with his own body, Chu Feng had clearly discovered an extremely worried look in Gu Mingyuan’s eyes.

That sort of worry could not be faked. Instead, she was truly worried for Chu Xuanzhengfa.

The changes in Gu Mingyuan’s behavior toward Chu Xuanzhengfa made Chu Feng very curious as to exactly what had happened between them.

Overwhelmed with curiosity, Chu Feng turned to ask Chu Lingxi, “Lingxi, do you know exactly what happened between your mother and father?”

“Even though they’re clearly your biological parents, why is their relationship so complicated?”

Of course, Chu Feng’s question was asked through voice transmission. He felt that this was a private matter, and shouldn’t be asked directly.

“It’s actually nothing serious. It’s an issue with my mother.”

Chu Lingxi did not attempt to conceal anything from the curious Chu Feng, and began to tell him about her parents.

Although Chu Xuanzhengfa was widely renowned in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he was simply unworthy of even being mentioned should he be placed in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

On the other hand, who was Gu Mingyuan? She was an existence that was equally as renowned as Chu Xuanyuan in her youth.

It could be said that there was no one in the Ancestral Martial Starfield that didn’t know her.

Furthermore, Gu Mingyuan was also very powerful, as it was her who had supported the rise of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.

From this, it could be seen that regardless of whether or not it might be status or strength, there was a massive disparity between Chu Xuanzhengfa and Gu Mingyuan.

However, sometimes fate was something that one could not stop.

By pure coincidence, Chu Xuanzhengfa had discovered a remnant.

It was inside that remnant that Chu Xuanzhengfa encountered Gu Mingyuan.

Gu Mingyuan had wanted to obtain the treasure inside that remnant. However, the treasures inside remnants were generally never easy to obtain.

One must either breach the formation protecting the remnant or satisfy the requirement of the remnant.

The master of that remnant had given a somewhat strange request.

Only married couples were allowed to retrieve the treasure.

It would naturally be impossible for Gu Mingyuan to have feelings for Chu Xuanzhengfa for the sake of a treasure. After all, she looked down on him from the bottom of her heart.

Unfortunately, the protective formation was already active. If the two of them did not satisfy the requirement, they would be trapped inside it.

Upon being trapped, they remained trapped for three entire years.

After three years passed, the two of them successfully escaped from the formation. However, when they left, they exited with an infant. That infant was Chu Lingxi.

“In other words, ultimately, for the sake of escaping, your mother came to terms?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right. It could be said that my mother was forced with no alternative. Even my birth could be said to be an accident.”

“Do you now know why my mother detests my father so much?”

“That said, my father had truly fallen for my mother.” Chu Lingxi spoke in a very helpless manner.

“So that’s the case.”

At this moment, a thought came into Chu Feng’s mind.

She felt that someone like Gu Mingyuan most definitely thought very highly of her reputation and integrity.

It would be impossible for her to be with someone she didn’t like for the sake of a treasure. It would be even more impossible for her to give birth to a child with someone she didn’t like for the sake of escaping from a formation.

Since they were trapped for three years, things must’ve happened during those three years.

Gu Mingyuan had feelings for Chu Xuanzhengfa. Furthermore, her feelings were rather deep.

If she didn’t have feelings for him, then, based on Gu Mingyuan’s personality, she would’ve very likely killed Chu Xuanzhengfa back then.

She would not have allowed the people of the world to know that she had married Chu Xuanzhengfa, and even had a child with him.

That said, Gu Mingyuan was most likely restraining herself the entire time, restraining her feelings for Chu Xuanzhengfa.

Why was she restraining herself? Likely, it was due to her pride.

There was simply too vast of a disparity between her and Chu Xuanzhengfa. Although she had feelings for him deep in her heart, she still felt that Chu Xuanzhengfa was unable to match her.

It was precisely due to her contradictory mentality that Gu Mingyuan ended up treating Chu Xuanzhengfa the way she currently did.
