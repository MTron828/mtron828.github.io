Chapter 5775: Dark Plunder

Chu Feng was not surprised by the kneeling Huangfu Fanni’s confusion.

This was the strength he had obtained in a fit of rage when Eggy disappeared. It came from his bloodline power, though it appeared to be tied to the Dao of Specialization too. Its origins were inexplicable to him, but it was special.

It granted him the power to raise his fighting prowess by a cultivation rank, but it was undetectable to others.

That was why Chu Feng could exert the might of a rank nine Half-God level cultivator despite being only at rank eight Half-God level at the moment, and no one else could sense the rise in his cultivation.

From their view, Chu Feng was no different from an ordinary rank eight Half-God level cultivator.

However, this power came with downsides. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

For one, it lowered his fighting prowess within the cultivation rank, in the sense that while he might be unmatched as a rank eight Half-God level cultivator, his superiority wouldn’t be retained when raising his fighting prowess by a rank with that power.

On top of that, the power would also affect his emotional state, making him cold-blooded, bloodthirsty, cruel, and even a little psychopathic, though Chu Feng personally thought that this only meant that he lacked self-control.

Thus, he had been training to gain greater control over this power, and it worked.

Not only was he able to preserve his superiority within the cultivation rank after raising his fighting prowess with the power, but he was also able to retain his rationality too. The only problem was that he couldn’t maintain this state for too long.

If he encountered a difficult enemy and fought for an extended period of time, he would gradually weaken while losing his rationality and becoming increasingly violent.

That being said, Huangfu Fanni was nowhere strong enough to push him to that point.

Shoosh!

Making use of Chu Feng’s momentary lapse in attention, Huangfu Fanni quickly retreated to open his black wooden box and retrieved a spear from within. With this God Armament in hand, his fighting prowess was further raised.

“Chu Feng, I expect you to keep your promise. You aren’t allowed to use your world spirit or your spirit power,” Huangfu Fanni said.

“Cut the crap and make your move,” Chu Feng said as he drew the Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

“An Exalted Armament? Chu Feng, you can’t underestimate the prowess of a God Armament!” Qin Xuan reminded.

He had no idea how Chu Feng was able to push back the rank nine Half-God level Huangfu Fanni despite being only at rank eight Half-God level himself, but he knew how critical this battle was to all of them. If Chu Feng lost this battle, their lives would be forfeited.

Thus, he didn’t want Chu Feng to get careless here.

“This isn’t good. Brother Chu Feng doesn’t have a God Armament,” Long Chengyu exclaimed.

Huangfu Fanni’s eyes lit up as he said, “That’s good, Chu Feng. You should only fight me with an Exalted Armament. You aren’t allowed to use a God Armament.”

“How shameless can you get?!” Both Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu bellowed.

“This is between Chu Feng and me. You two should stay out of it!” Huangfu Fanni glared at Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu before turning to Chu Feng. “Chu Feng, do you dare to fight me with just an Exalted Armament?”

“Why not? I’ll fight you with an Exalted Armament, but I’ll put this out here. If you can’t defeat me, then Huangfu Fanni, you’re going to die today,” Chu Feng said.

Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu were stunned. They couldn’t believe Chu Feng was going to kill Huangfu Fanni.

They did think that Huangfu Fanni deserved to die, especially after how he had tried to kill them, but the strength of the five Huangfus and the treasures they had brought out showed that the Huangfu Heavenly Clan was no pushover. There were bound to be many experts in their clan.

Chu Feng was already enemies with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, the biggest powerhouse in the present world of cultivation, so it was unwise of him to cross the Huangfu Heavenly Clan, a powerhouse from the Ancient Era, on top of that.

Did Chu Feng really not care about that?

“If you defeat me with an Exalted Armament without resorting to your spirit power and world spirits, I, Huangfu Fanni, will willingly accept my death here,” Huangfu Fanni said.

“You should bring out everything you’re capable of lest you die with regrets,” Chu Feng said.

“I will,” Huangfu Fanni replied.

He thrust his spear forward and charged at Chu Feng with a flash of lightning. It was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill!

Chu Feng didn’t bother dodging. He casually executed an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill with his Exalted Armament and dissipated the lightning spear.

“He blocked it?” Long Chengyu explained.

“And he used a weaker Exalted Taboo Martial Skill on top of that. Is it just a coincidence?” Qin Xuan remarked with a frown.

In the blink of an eye, Chu Feng and Huangfu Fanni were clashing once more.

Huangfu Fanni carefully made sure to keep a distance from Chu Feng while bombarding him with Exalted Taboo Martial Skills, while Chu Feng fended Huangfu Fani off with Exalted Taboo Martial Skills of his own.

Qin Xuan couldn’t help but notice that Chu Feng made sure to execute Exalted Taboo Martial Skills that were a rank weaker than Huangfu Fanni’s.

“It can’t be a coincidence…” Qin Xuan was startled.

A rank eight Half-God level cultivator wielding an Exalted Armament was fighting with a rank nine Half-God level cultivator, but somehow the former was able to stand his ground despite using Exalted Taboo Martial Skills that were a rank weaker every single time.

Just how terrifyingly powerful was Chu Feng?

Chu Feng was practically humiliating Huangfu Fanni at this point!

However, Qin Xuan felt a fiery sting on his cheeks too. It felt satisfying to see Chu Feng playing Huangfu Fanni like a child, but he hadn’t forgotten how he, Long Chengyu, and Xian Miaomiao had joined hands against Huangfu Fanni earlier but were unable to overcome him. Needless to say, he would only fare worse against Chu Feng.

“What are you laughing at?” Qin Xuan looked at Long Chengyu and saw the latter laughing at him.

“I’m laughing at how narrow-minded you are. Make sure to look closely. Chu Feng will overturn your common sense about martial cultivation,” Long Chengyu said.

“He has already done so,” Qin Xuan replied grudgingly.

“No, this is only the start. You’ll see. Your common sense will be shattered time and time again,” Long Chengyu said with a smile.

Uwa!

Huangfu Fanni was suddenly sent flying with a cry.

Chu Feng had executed a martial skill in mid-air, and it ended up puncturing Huangfu Fanni’s chest with a hole. Despite using Exalted Taboo Martial Skills that were a rank weaker, he was still able to severely wound Huangfu Fanni.

“Is this all the Huangfu Heavenly Clan is capable of?” Chu Feng looked at Huangfu Fanni in disdain with the Immemorial Hero’s Sword in hand.

“I won’t stand for you insulting the Huangfu Heavenly Clan!”

Huangfu Fanni straightened his back and held his spear upright in front of him. The ancient palace shook, and a powerful surge of lightning bolted out of his body. This surge of lightning grew larger and larger, till it manifested into a massive lightning flood dragon behind him.

Even though it was a flood dragon instead of a complete dragon, it had a pair of sagacious eyes, and it emanated an incomparably terrifying aura.

“It’s a God Taboo Martial Skill,” Qin Xuan, Long Chengyu, and Xian Miaomiao muttered.

“God Taboo: Lightning Flood Dragon!” Huangfu Fanni roared as the lightning flood dragon fused as one with his spear.

All of a sudden, he stiffened up.

Qin Xuan, Long Chengyu, and Xian Miaomiao froze in place too.

Chu Feng had suddenly appeared behind Huangfu Fanni’s back. He was so fast that no one noticed his movements until he was already there. He was surrounded by a sinister black aura that seemed to have come from hell. It resembled the aura of an Asura World Spirit.

Why would Chu Feng emanate such a dark aura?

Sensing that something was amiss, Huangfu Fanni tried to put some distance before them before executing his God Taboo Martial Skill, but Chu Feng’s black aura enveloped him before he could make a move.

“Secret Skill: Dark Plunder.”
