Chapter 4888: A Chance

Shengguang Xintian’s Exalted Armament pink sword lunged straight toward Chu Feng. Even before it could get close, one could already feel its incredible pressure and killing intent.

This wasn’t just a scare. She really intended to end Chu Feng’s life here.

In truth, there was no deep-seated grudge between her and Chu Feng. All the latter did was to throw her into the fecal lake, and the fecal lake was beneficial toward her despite its horrible stench.

It went against her will, but she didn’t suffer any losses. Instead, she benefited from the encounter.

But even so, she still wanted to kill Chu Feng.

This was her arrogance as a young miss of the Holy Valley. No one could get away scot-free after making her unhappy.

“Heh!”

Faced with her aggression, Chu Feng simply let out a cold sneer.

Her oppressive might dissipated as soon as it came close to Chu Feng, and her body froze up in mid-air.

Chu Feng didn’t even raise his hand in the process, and none of the crowd could sense any energy coming out of him either. Yet, everyone implicitly knew that this was his doing.

The energy Chu Feng had grasped was more than enough to obliterate every single one of them here.

“You scoundrel! What kind of man are you to rely on solely external power? If you’re a man, fight me with your own cultivation!”

Despite being frozen in place, Shengguang Xintian still continued howling at Chu Feng indignantly.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng swiped his hand forward, and the Exalted Armament sword that was in Shengguang Xintian’s hand a moment ago flew into his grasp.

“If I’m not mistaken, you tried to kill me earlier, didn’t you?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Chu Feng touched the sword lightly as he looked at Shengguang Xintian with eyes filled with hostility. It was like the calm before the storm, leaving everyone feeling greatly unnerved by what was going to come next.

“Brother Chu Feng, little sister Xintian has always been a fiery-tempered person. She had no intention of really taking your life!”

Shengguang Chuyao hurriedly tried to mediate the situation.

“Brother Chuyao, if I can’t even discern real killing intent, I would have spent my years in vain,” Chu Feng replied.

“So what if I really wanted to kill you? What are you going to do about it? Kill me if you dare then! I’ll see how you intend to walk out of the Holy Valley alive!” Shengguang Xintian howled.

“You want to die that badly? Sure, I’ll grant your wish!”

Clang!

Chu Feng pointed the Exalted Armament sword toward Shengguang Xintian.

“Make your move!”

Shengguang Xintian remained unfazed despite having the sword pointed at her. She even taunted Chu Feng further.

“You think that I’d be afraid of the Holy Valley?”

Killing intent blazed in Chu Feng’s eyes. He took a step forward and thrust the sword straight into Shengguang Xintian’s face.

“AH!!!”

The arrogant Shengguang Xintian closed her eyes in horror. She didn’t think that Chu Feng would actually dare to stab her.

However, when she opened her eyes once more, she saw that Chu Feng’s sword had stopped a mere centimeter in front of her. She was unharmed.

Yet, the brush she had with death left her completely traumatized. It wasn’t something she could recover from on the spot. All of her previous arrogance had been driven out of her body with the earlier sword thrust. Her eyes glistened with tears as the edges of her lips quivered ever so slightly.

She was afraid.

Putting her aside, even Shengguang Menglai was seeing Chu Feng in a different light too.

The killing intent that Chu Feng had given off earlier was utterly horrifying.

Anyone was capable of emanating killing intent, but the degree of it differed from individual to individual. How could a rat’s killing intent come close to that of a tiger’s?

And the killing intent Chu Feng gave off earlier felt like it had come straight from the demons of hell. It could have only come from a merciless grim reaper who had taken countless lives in the past.

At the very least, none of the juniors present possessed killing intent that could rival his.

The crowd looked down on Chu Feng at the very start, thinking that he was a countryside bumpkin who wasn’t worthy of being in their group. Later, when they got deceived by him, they simply shrugged it off, thinking that he was just a bold schemer.

It was only at this instant that they realized that Chu Feng might be much more terrifying than they had expected.

He was a person who lived in a completely different world from theirs.

They were all talented juniors, but they lived vastly different lives.

The juniors of the Holy Valley were delicate flowers that grew up in a protected environment. Everything they needed was given to them on a silver platter.

But Chu Feng had to trample across mountains of corpses and rivers of blood in order to get where he was.

“I, Chu Feng, don’t like to squabble with women, but you, Shengguang Xintian, is an exception. Blame your grandfather if you must. He was the one who messed with me first. However, I’ll give you a chance on the account that you’re a woman. I’ll let you off this once, but don’t test my patience ever again. I don’t have that much tolerance as to forgive someone who tries to take my life a second time.”

Right after Chu Feng uttered those cold words, Shengguang Xintian was suddenly released from her invisible restraints and plummeted to the ground.

Shengguang Xintian could have flown to break the fall, but out of distraught from the earlier traumatizing experience, she was completely unable to react.

Chu Feng looked Shengguang Xintian in utmost disdain as he tossed the Exalted Armament sword to her. His meaning was clear.

If Shengguang Xintian wanted another fight, he was willing to give it to her. It was just that she shouldn’t expect to walk out alive at the end of it.

“Are you really going to let her off just like that? She tried to take your life earlier!” Yu Sha said.

Yu Sha wasn’t the type to speak much, but even she couldn’t stand what Shengguang Xintian did earlier. If Chu Feng wasn’t strong enough earlier, he would have been dead by now.

“She’s a woman, after all. I should give her a chance,” Chu Feng replied.

“Is there any use to that?” Yu Sha asked.

“Hard to say. Who cares? If she dares to do it again, I won’t spare her even if she’s a woman,” Chu Feng replied.

Shengguang Xintian slowly reached out and picked up her Exalted Armament sword. However, she no longer tried to make a move on Chu Feng anymore. Instead, she stowed her Exalted Armament away before quietly walking behind Shengguang Menglai.

She looked like a proud bird who had its wings crippled, left with no choice but to seek refuge with someone she trusted.

Her attitude evoked pity, but more than that, it surprised the crowd, especially for the juniors from the Holy Valley.

They knew what kind of person Shengguang Xintian was. She was the type who would dare to stand up against her grandfather once she got angry. Yet, she actually admitted defeat here.

It was a thorough defeat at that. She didn’t even dare to meet Chu Feng’s eyes.

Shengguang Menglai looked at Chu Feng quietly with a wary glint in her eyes. Even she was getting a little intimidated by this outsider.
