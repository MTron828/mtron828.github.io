Chapter 2936 - Who Were The Actual Cowards

After finding out that the Blackflame Ghost Sword was actually the long lost clan-protection treasure of their Chu Heavenly Clan, and then sensing the expressions of expectation from the crowd, those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations immediately felt enormous pressure.

They also knew that as clansmen of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they possessed an obligation to retrieve the Blackflame Ghost Sword.

However, the crimson fog emitted by the Illusory Blood Lotus was simply too frightening. It was already so terrifying earlier; and now, it was even more dangerous. They truly did not wish to brave this danger with their lives.

In fact, they did not even want to attempt to enter the crimson fog again.

“That Blackflame Ghost Sword might not necessarily be the real one, no?”

With the situation being like that, a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation asked such a question.

He said those words because he wanted to give himself some justification to not take on such a risk.

However, once he said those words, he immediately caused the surrounding crowd to feel displeased. In fact, an aged elder among them even directly said to him, “Never has a treasure from the Illusory Blood Lotus been fake.”

Upon hearing those words, not only did that member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation who spoke earlier start to frown, but even the others of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations revealed a somewhat displeased expression.

They were merely trying to find an excuse to not take on such risk for themselves. Never did they expect that the bystanders would refuse to even give them a way out of such a difficult situation.

Naturally, they would feel displeased.

Right at that moment, Chu Huanyu said, “So what if it’s real? With how dangerous the crimson fog is, if one is to enter it, one will undoubtedly be throwing away their life.”

Since he said those words, it would appear that he had no desire to enter the crimson fog again.

“What Young Master Huanyu says is extremely true,” once Chu Huanyu said those words, the other Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations immediately echoed in agreement.

Not to mention Chu Huanyu, not even Chu Ruoshi seemed to have any intention of entering the crimson fog and retrieving the Blackflame Ghost Sword.

The crowd were actually able to understand why this was happening. After all, they had personally witnessed how dangerous that crimson fog was.

That said, even though this was the case, the crowd was still more or less disappointed. After all, that was a clan-protection treasure of the Chu Heavenly Clan. If they were to miss this opportunity, it might never return again.

Although their unwillingness to enter the crimson fog was pardonable, it served to prove that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations did not possess sufficient courage.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, a figure suddenly flew directly into the crimson fog.

The crowd’s expressions all changed enormously upon seeing that.

The reason for that was because that person was not a person of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation or the Starfall Holy Land’s younger generation.

That person... was actually Chu Feng.

That’s right, it was Chu Feng!

After verifying that the person who had entered the crimson fog was Chu Feng, the crowd present were immediately bewildered.

Earlier, when the crimson fog was not as dangerous as it was at that moment, Chu Feng had warned the crowd that it was very dangerous, and that they should not enter it.

At that time, Chu Feng was even called a coward by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, the precariousness of the crimson fog had now more than doubled. Not even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations dared to enter it. However, at such a time, Chu Feng actually chose to enter the crimson fog.

Exactly why was Chu Feng doing this? Exactly what was his motive?

That said, regardless of what Chu Feng’s motive was, the crowd inevitably started to compare Chu Feng with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, and began to think who among them were the actual cowards.

......

After Chu Feng entered the crimson fog, he soon closed his eyes.

The crowd outside were extremely astonished..

The question that most of them were pondering was why Chu Feng was braving such danger to obtain that Blackstone Ghost Sword?

After all, from the reaction Chu Feng revealed earlier, the crowd were able to tell that Chu Feng was not a person who would become reckless and impulsive upon seeing a treasure.

Only the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master, Elder Xingyi and a few other people had an expression of certainty in their eyes.

They all felt that Chu Feng was most definitely related to Chu Hanxian.

If Chu Feng was related to Chu Hanxian, it would mean that there was a very high possibility that he was related to Chu Xuanyuan too.

When thinking of this, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master became excited.

It was for no other reason than because he was certain that Chu Feng was Chu Hanxian’s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan’s son.

That said, his excitement only lasted for a short moment before he started revealing an expressing an expression of worry on his face.

Chu Feng was already showing pain on his face. Furthermore, he was letting out groans.

However, this was only the beginning. Chu Feng’s face started to grow more and more distorted. Blood began to flow from his seven facial orifices. After that, he started to scream loudly.

His scream was so miserable that one would shiver upon hearing it.

With the situation being like that, many people present started to worry deeply for Chu Feng.

However, Chu Huanyu, Song Yunfei and the others started to sneer.

“Eyes blinded by greed, serves you right,” Song Yunfei mocked.

“Eyes blinded by greed? Brother Song, what you’ve said is incorrect, no?”

“If Chu Feng’s eyes were blinded by greed, why didn’t he attempt to enter when that peerless Immortal Armament was present? Why would he enter now when the crimson fog became even more dangerous?” Xia Yun’er asked.

Although she was a fellow disciple of the Starfall Holy Land, Xia Yun’er was unable to continue to tolerate Song Yunfei’s repeated attacks at Chu Feng.

“Junior sister, you...”

Song Yunfei never expected for Xia Yun’er to say this sort of thing before all those people.

At that moment, his expression turned very ugly.

It was not that he was at a loss for words as to how to refute Xia Yun’er. Instead, he was feeling as if blades were piercing his heart. He was in no mood to refute Xia Yun’er, and he did not want to refute her either.

“Miss Xia, it seems that you possess quite a relationship with that Chu Feng. You’ve actually even contradicted your senior brother for the sake of that Chu Feng.”

“However, I’d urge you to not speak for that Chu Feng so quickly. After all, it’s a question in and of itself as to whether Chu Feng will be able to survive the crimson fog.”

“If he dies, wouldn’t you have contradicted your senior brother for nothing?” Chu Huanyu mocked.

“Look! Little friend Chu Feng seems about to regain consciousness!”

However, right after Chu Huanyu said those words, someone shouted in alarm.

“How could this be?!” Hearing those words, Chu Huanyu immediately revealed a change in expression.

It was not only him; the expressions of practically everyone present had changed. It was merely that Chu Ruoshi, Chu Huanyu, Song Yunfei and Ren Xiaoyao were even more astonished by it.

After all, they were unable to regain consciousness in the crimson fog when the crimson fog was not as dangerous as it was now.

And now, the difficulty of the crimson fog had increased so much. If Chu Feng were to regain consciousness in the crimson fog, wouldn’t it mean that Chu Feng’s strength was above their own?

At the moment when Chu Huanyu and the other younger generations were worrying, Chu Feng suddenly opened his tightly closed eyes.

Chu Feng actually really managed to regain consciousness in the crimson fog.

At that moment, cheers began to sound from the crowd.

The crowd were truly unable to contain their excitement.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had not only regained consciousness in the crimson fog, but he also no longer had an expression of pain on his face.

Most importantly, Chu Feng began to fly through the crimson fog unhurriedly. He was approaching the Illusory Blood Lotus.

This meant that Chu Feng had successfully broken through the crimson fog’s illusion formation.

With this, how could the crowd not feel excited?
