Chapter 3974 - Chu Feng’s Invasion

“It’s Grandmaster Feng You!”

Looking towards the voice, the crowd noticed the person who’d spoken those words, and all revealed looks of respect.

The person who’d spoken did not belong to any power.

However, the leaders of the six major powers as well as their elders all knew of him.

That Grandmaster Feng You was an old man in a cyan daoist robe. He was rather fat, but still emitted the airs of an immortal.

The reason why he was so famous was because he was an exceptional world spiritist.

Grandmaster Feng You was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

“Grandmaster Feng You, what other sort of possibility could allow that child to disregard the spirit formations?” asked the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

“Through this old man’s observations, even though that spirit formation serves as an enormous obstruction for martial cultivators, its obstruction towards world spiritists is relatively minor.”

“If one were an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, one would be able to breach that spirit formation on one’s own. Furthermore, the time needed to do so would be slightly faster than the time it would take with the combined efforts of all your six powers’ disciples.”

“And if one were a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, one would be able to effortlessly breach the spirit formation. The time needed to breach the spirit formation would be simply negligible.”

“Above all, if one were a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, one could directly disregard the spirit formations. There would simply be no need to even breach them,” said Grandmaster Feng You.

After hearing Grandmaster Feng You’s words, the crowd all decided to disregard them.

They firmly believed that Grandmaster Feng You would not be mistaken.

Since Grandmaster Feng You said that Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists could disregard those protective formations, it was most definitely true.

However, for a person of the younger generation to be a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist was something they’d never witnessed before, something they’d never heard of before.

Because of that, they decided to ignore the things Grandmaster Feng You had said.

The reason why they decided to ignore it was because they believed that it was practically impossible for the other possibility Grandmaster Feng You had spoken of to be true.

They were certain that Wang Chen had some sort of treasure on him. They felt that it was impossible for him to be a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

......

The speed at which Chu Feng moved was too fast. After all, he was able to ignore the spirit formations.

All of his time was spent on traveling to different purple pillars of light. As for breaching those spirit formations, it was simply effortless.

As such, he was much faster at retrieving the treasures than Nangong Yifan and others.

Ultimately, Chu Feng managed to breach four spirit formations and retrieve four treasures on his own.

Adding the two treasures he’d obtained from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain, Chu Feng currently had six treasures.

As for Nangong Yifan, after he defeated Wu Ming and Miao Jiutian, he led the disciples from the All-heaven Sect and successfully breached a spirit formation.

Currently, he had five treasures on him.

Furthermore, he was breaching the final spirit formation.

At that moment, everyone outside became extremely excited.

Although the people inside the spirit formation world didn’t know the details of what was going on, the spectators outside knew everything that was happening in the spirit formation world through the mirror image in the sky.

In fact, they were able to clearly see that the newly emerged Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciple to be reckoned with, Wang Chen, was flying towards Nangong Yifan.

Everyone knew that a battle could erupt at any moment.

The crowd’s hearts were all filled with anticipation as to whether it would be Nangong Yifan or the mysterious disciple Wang Chen who would emerge victorious.

That said, no one noticed that even though Chu Feng, in the disguise of Wang Chen, had given them confidence that he could contend against Nangong Yifan, the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster remained confident the entire time.

He was not worried about Nangong Yifan in the slightest.

In fact, that gaze of his seemed like he was waiting for Wang Chen to meet his doom.

It was as if no matter how outstanding of a performance Wang Chen had given earlier, he still firmly believed that Wang Chen would not be able to defeat Nangong Yifan. Instead, he would only become a stepping stone to further Nangong Yifan’s fame.

The battles between Nangong Yifan and Shentu Haoli, and then Wu Ming and Miao Jiutian, were known to the entire spirit formation world.

However, the battle between Chu Feng, Song Jinglun and the others of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain did not create a large fanfare.

Because of that, Nangong Yifan had no idea of Wang Chen’s existence. He also did not know that there was someone who had retrieved the treasures from the four other purple pillars ahead of him.

Nangong Yifan believed that he had already defeated everyone.

However, apart from the purple pillar of light before him, there were four others that were still unbreached.

He believed that he had to speed up. As such, it was not only the All-heaven Sect’s disciples that were working hard on breaching the spirit formation, but even Nangong Yifan himself was putting forth all of his strength to breach that spirit formation.

Knowing what Nangong Yifan had in mind, the disciples from the All-heaven Sect did not dare to slack off.

They were all putting forth all of their effort in breaching the spirit formation. They placed so much concentration into the breaching process that they neglected everything happening around them.

“You all should stop wasting your time. You can leave this place to me.”

Suddenly, a voice exploded in the distant sky. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

That voice surprised all of the All-heaven Sect’s disciples.

When the All-heaven Sect’s disciples turned to the voice and saw the figure standing in the sky above, they were surprised and, to a greater extent, astonished and confused.

When such a voice was heard, their first reaction was that someone had come to create trouble for them.

Yet, there was only a single person in the sky.

That person was wearing the outfit of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect. However, the All-heaven Sect disciples did not recognize him.

Such a nobody actually dared to create trouble for them?

After Nangong Yifan had defeated Shentu Haoli, Wu Ming and Miao Jiutian in succession, a nameless nobody actually still dared to challenge their All-heaven Sect?

This brought them utter disbelief.

Nangong Yifan also took a glance at Chu Feng. However, after doing so, he decided to ignore him completely. He turned around and continued to breach the spirit formation.

The reason why Nangong Yifan had decided to ignore Chu Feng was because he felt that he was not qualified for him to involve himself.

Furthermore, as the All-heaven Sect’s disciples were a tyrannical bunch, even if he decided to ignore him, the other disciples would definitely take care of him.

“Scram!”

Sure enough, a voice filled with displeasure exploded. At the same time, an overwhelming oppressive might swept straight for Chu Feng.

It was the oppressive might of a rank two Exalted.

The person who’d unleashed that oppressive might was someone Chu Feng knew.

That man’s name was Beiyang Luo.

When Nangong Yifan had gone to the Ancestral Martial Starfield, that Beiyang Luo had followed him closely.

Although Beiyang Luo was also a genius, he was Nangong Yifan’s loyal lackey.

Beiyang Luo simply did not place Chu Feng in his eyes at all.

As such, he had unleashed his oppressive might toward Chu Feng with his back facing him.

Furthermore, after unleashing his oppressive might, he did not bother with Chu Feng anymore. He was absolutely confident that his oppressive might would be able to send that nameless Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciple flying.

“Beiyang Luo, you really shouldn’t have attacked me.”

When Chu Feng’s voice sounded again, Beiyang Luo’s heart tensed up. In fact, all of the disciples from the All-heaven Sect felt their hearts tensing up. Even Nangong Yifan revealed a look of surprise.

In the next instant, all of the All-heaven Sect disciples turned their gazes to Chu Feng.

At that moment, the shock in their eyes grew even stronger.

That nameless Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciple was still standing in the sky. He was not only completely uninjured, but he was also completely unmoved.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, like a phantom, Chu Feng disappeared.

In the next instant, the expressions of all of the All-heaven Sect’s disciples changed enormously.

When they saw Chu Feng again, he had arrived within their camp.

Furthermore, he was standing right before Beiyang Luo.

Chu Feng grabbed Beiyang Luo’s neck and raised him up high.

Although Beiyang Luo was a rank two Exalted, he had a pained look on his face.

He looked as if he had lost the ability to resist.

“It would appear that I did not make myself clear enough earlier.”

“Allow me to repeat myself.”

“From this point forward, everything here belongs to me.”

“You’d all best leave obediently. If anyone dares to resist, you will suffer...”

“... the same sort of consequence as him.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng suddenly tightened his grasp.

“Snap~”

Beiyang Luo’s neck had been crushed by Chu Feng.
