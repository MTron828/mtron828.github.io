Chapter 5683: I’ll Reach the Top Even If It Draws Everyone’s Hostility

Chapter 5683: I’ll Reach the Top Even If It Draws Everyone’s Hostility

“Let him go. I don’t believe he can clear the subsequent towers too,” Jie Feng suddenly spoke up.

The person from the Jie Clan Heaven Crushing Army quickly stepped aside, and Chu Feng walked past him to enter the sixth Seven Stars Gravity Tower.

There were more than a thousand unconcealed people gathered around the Seven Stars Gravity Towers, and among them was an extremely influential person.

He was Ling Mouzi, a skinny elder with green eyes. He was one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Saint-tier elders.

Other than Ling Mouzi, Ling Canghai, and a few other elders, most people from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were nervous. They fervently hoped for Chu Feng’s failure, but they felt that there was a chance he could succeed, considering his earlier state.

Moments later, the sixth Seven Stars Gravity Tower shuddered, and a pillar of light pierced through the clouds.

“Damn it!” Many juniors gritted their teeth and cursed.

Chu Feng had broken Ling Xiao’s record. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This was an embarrassment to them. The elders could still conceal their emotions, but the juniors were livid.

Chu Feng knew he was in a terrible position when he walked out of the sixth tower and saw angry looks around him.

He had known this would happen, but he still went through with it because he sensed that the Seven Stars Gravity Towers were constructed from a treasure that harnessed great energy. As long as he cleared all seven towers, he could?unleash the treasure’s energy and receive a powerful protection formation that could protect him from even pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritists.

This protection treasure could only be used in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but it would help to ensure Chu Feng’s safety.

He had no intention of staying in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion for long; he was planning to leave this place as soon as he received the Saint-tier treasure. As a matter of fact, he wouldn’t have even participated in the entrance examination if not to save Eggy.

However, he was afraid that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would refuse to let him go.

There were good people in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but on the whole, they were domineering in how they conducted their affairs. It was not impossible for them to take his life if any unhappiness arose from their interactions.

Thus, it would be best if he could secure this protection formation as insurance.

That was also the reason he thanked that elder, since the latter’s permission had given him a chance to obtain the protective formation. He couldn’t care less about whether the crowd was happy with him or not.

“Chu Feng, you shouldn’t carry on.”

Just as Chu Feng was about to make his way to the seventh Seven Stars Gravity Tower, Ling Xinian suddenly sent a voice transmission to him. She was trying to dissuade Chu Feng too.

However, Chu Feng ignored her and stepped into the tower.

Moments later, a light pillar gushed forth from the tower. The seven pillars of light from the seven towers then converged together to form a constellation formation, forming a majestic phenomenon.

Even the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster was impressed, as he turned to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and said, “Has no one successfully cleared all seven towers before?”

“That child is the first one,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“He’s that talented? The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master has sharp eyes. Congratulations on bringing a prodigy of such caliber into your ranks!” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster said.

He had initially thought that Chu Feng was merely talented, but he was now convinced that the latter could compete with the top juniors in the world of cultivation.

In contrast, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was much calmer. “Our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has no lack of prodigies. It’s his honor to serve us.”

“That goes without saying,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster agreed with a laugh.

…

Soon, the constellation formation descended from the sky and gushed into the seventh tower, right into Chu Feng’s body.

At Chu Feng’s will, the power of the constellation formation would rush out to envelop his body. This was the protective formation he was rewarded with for clearing all seven towers, and it was as formidable as he had thought.

“Indeed!” Chu Feng thought that it was worth offending the crowd to obtain this.

Without any hesitation, he made his way out of the tower, but he intentionally feigned weakness.

Under normal circumstances, most people would have rushed forward to congratulate him on accomplishing such a formidable feat, but not a single person in the crowd did so.

Even Ling Xinian, Ling Yunhao, and the others kept their distance. Some of them even dared not to look at him. They were determined to pretend that they didn’t know him.

“I heard that the Seven Stars Gravity Tower has been recalibrated to lower the pressure. It looks like the rumors are true,” a red-haired man suddenly spoke up.

He was neither a junior nor an elder, being around five hundred years of age. He would be considered as one of the younger generations in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Even though he was centuries old, he didn’t look mature at all. Instead, there was an arrogant look on his face, even when his words were obviously nonsense.

“Is that so? That explains it.”

Yet, someone immediately agreed with his nonsense. In fact, more and more people nodded their heads in agreement despite knowing that it was fake news.

Jie Feng’s condition was the best proof of that.

It was as if the crowd had tacitly chosen to band together to weave a lie and turn it into the truth.

Seeing the crowd’s serious expressions, Chu Feng nearly burst into laughter. He couldn’t believe how such arrogant people could have such fragile hearts. They would go to the extent of weaving a lie just to protect their honor.

Chu Feng had wanted to leave, but the red-haired man flitted up to him and asked, “Chu Feng, do you dare to take on our Seven Realms Challenge Formation?”

“I’m not interested.” Chu Feng felt that he had already drawn enough animosity today, and he didn’t want to worsen the situation.

He didn’t think it was wise for him to turn the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion against him when he hadn’t obtained his Saint-tier treasure yet.

“Bastard, just say so if you don’t have the guts! Why are you saying that you’re not interested?” the red-haired man sneered in hopes of taunting Chu Feng.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng still showed no response at all. He wasn’t so immature as to fall for such cheap provocation tactics.

“Little brother Chu Feng, why don’t you give it a try?” Ling Xinian suddenly sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.
