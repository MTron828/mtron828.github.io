Chapter 4041 - I Shall See Who Dares Touch Him

“As this old man has promised the Three Cities’ masters, I will have to keep my word.”

“However, this matter is unrelated to my clansmen.”

“If Milord truly wants to kill, please kill this old man alone.”

As the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, he actually stepped into the sky and began to slowly walk towards Wuming Fenghong.

He was simply walking over to throw his life away.

“Lord Clan Chief, you must not!”

Seeing that, Chu Xuanzhengfa and many others immediately rushed forth to stop him.

However, they were astonished to discover that an invisible barrier was before them. That barrier blocked all of them from approaching.

It was oppressive might. It was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s oppressive might.

As the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not wish for them to throw their lives away in vain, he had used his oppressive might to block all of them.

“Do you think this old man does not dare to kill you?” Wuming Fenghong narrowed his brows and asked in a cold voice.

“Milord is naturally daring enough to kill me. However, since this old man promised the Three Cities’ masters, I will have to uphold my promise to them.”

“Today, no matter what, I cannot yield my position. The only alternative would be this old man’s death.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had a look of determination. He was actually not afraid, even in the face of death.

It was as if he had anticipated this. It seemed like he had made preparations for it long ago.

“Arrogant fellow, do you really think that this old man wouldn’t dare kill you?”

“You are nothing more than an ant. This old man will have you realize your status right now.”

The conceited Wuming Fenghong was enraged by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s behavior. As he spoke, he actually really released his killing intent.

Right when that Wuming Fenghong intended to attack, a voice sounded.

“Wait!”

If the person who had called for him to wait was a Chu Heavenly Clansman, Wuming Fenghong would definitely ignore it.

However, it just so happened that that voice came from within his Wuming Clan.

It turned out that it was one of the Wuming Clan’s Ten Great Experts, Wuming Xingyun.

“Lord Fenghong, please allow me to speak to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.”

Wuming Xingyun arrived before Wuming Fenghong and asked for permission.

If it were someone else from the Ten Great Experts that had said that, Wuming Fenghong might not necessarily give them face. Instead, he might lash out at them.

However, it was different for Wuming Xingyun. Not only was Wuming Xingyun one of the Ten Great Experts, he was also an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He was someone with an extraordinary status within the Wuming Clan.

“Xingyun, it’s not that I am refusing to give you face, it’s simply that this old man had his head muddled with his desire for authority, and forgot his status.”

“An ant like him actually dared to hoot at our Wuming Clan.”

“If we are to spare him, and the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield all decide to imitate him, what dignity would our clan have then?” said Wuming Fenghong.

“Lord Fenghong, please allow me to try to persuade him,” Wuming Xingyun asked again.

“Lord Fenghong, let’s have Lord Xingyun attempt to persuade him.”

“Lord Fenghong, please let Lord Xingyun give it a try.”

Right at that moment, two more voices were heard.

They were actually two people from the younger generation.

However, those two people of the younger generation were no ordinary people.

They were Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo.

They were the two strongest geniuses of the Wuming Clan, their clan’s future hope.

Following them, a few more voices sounded from within the Wuming Clan. They also hoped to be able to persuade the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Among them was another of the Ten Great Experts, Wuming Fenghuo.

That Wuming Fenghuo had been to the Chu Heavenly Clan and had witnessed Chu Feng’s talent.

Because of that, he greatly acknowledged Chu Feng, and had a very good impression of the Chu Heavenly Clan because of him.

With so many people appearing to stop Wuming Fenghong, with many of them possessing extraordinary statuses, many bystanders felt surprised.

What they didn’t know was that those people did not stand up to dissuade Wuming Fenghong because they were afraid of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Rather, it was purely because they were giving Chu Feng face.

With the situation like that, even Wuming Fenghong felt himself to be in a somewhat difficult situation.

“Milords, I thank you all for your kind intentions.”

“However, this old man has already made his decision.”

“This old man is not qualified to pass my Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord status to others.”

“If the Wuming Clan really intends to take it away, please do so over this old man’s corpse,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said loudly.

It wasn’t that he was refusing the face that had been given to him, nor was he unable to understand their kind intentions.

He actually knew better than anyone that he would be able to escape unscathed as long as he yielded to the Wuming Clan.

However, he was stubborn. He also had his own dignity.

He knew very well that there were many people that were dissatisfied with him being the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord.

Because he didn’t possess sufficient strength, he held no complaints towards their opinions of him.

However, he did not retaliate against them just because they had looked down on him.

Rather, he tried his hardest, and did his best to carry out his duty.

Whilst it was true that he did not possess the strength to be the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord, he wanted others to know that even if he did not possess sufficient strength, his moral character was something that they could put absolute confidence in.

Since he had taken up the status of overlord, he would have to defend it.

If he were to abdicate from his status and surrender purely because of how strong the Wuming Clan was, he would not be able to raise his head up for the rest of his life.

He felt that a person that cowardly was actually the kind of person that wasn’t qualified to sit on the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord seat.

Thus, even if he were to die, he absolutely would not give in.

“Well, well, well. You truly are an old fool who refuses the face that is given to you.”

“Since you want to die so badly, I will help you grant your wish.”

Wuming Fenghong had looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to begin with.

He had been cursing him out for being shameless the moment he learned that he had taken on the status of the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Originally, he had thought the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to be a monkey that proclaimed itself as king since the tigers weren’t home. He’d thought that he would immediately scram, piss himself in fear and surrender his overlord status upon seeing them.

What he did not expect was that even after he’d made their intentions clear, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was still unwilling to hand over the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord status.

That was something that greatly irritated him. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was considering the Three Cities, he would’ve killed the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief already.

Yet, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would rather die than submit. This was simply testing his patience.

The killing intent in Wuming Fenghong’s eyes increased to a point where it was visible to everyone present.

He was really intended to kill the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

With that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief closed his eyes and prepared himself for death.

“I shall see who dares touch him!”

Suddenly, a furious shout exploded.

The expressions of the great majority of the people present changed when that voice was heard.

The reason for that was because that voice sounded very familiar. It actually sounded like Chu Feng’s voice.

As such, everyone turned their eyes to the direction the voice had come from.

Under the crowd’s focused eyes, a figure appeared in their field of vision.

That person was precisely who they were all thinking of... Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had returned!

Chu Feng was flying over from afar. He ignored everyone present and went straight over to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and landed before him.

“Chu Feng...” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was very surprised to see Chu Feng.

“Lord Clan Chief, it’s alright now. You can leave everything to me,” Chu Feng said to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded.

Even though he was the clan chief, the youth before him had already become the pillar of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Furthermore, Chu Feng had never disappointed him.

He felt that even if they were faced with the Wuming Clan, Chu Feng would still be able to handle it.

After comforting the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Feng turned around and swept his cold gaze across the Wuming Clan’s army.

At that moment, the previously noisy crowd had become absolutely quiet.

There were people that did not even dare to face Chu Feng’s gaze.

The crowd were afraid. Their previously contempt and insult-filled gazes aimed at the Chu Heavenly Clan had disappeared completely.

It was not only those bystanders. Many of the Wuming Clansmen were also scared.

Whilst they looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, none of them dared to look down on Chu Feng.

As matters stood, they all knew very well that the reason the Chu Heavenly Clan was able to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord was not because of their clan chief, but rather because of Chu Feng.

The Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Divine Body Royal City, Monstrous Beast Sacred City and Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan had insisted on making the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord not because they thought highly of him.

Rather, it was all because they were giving Chu Feng face.

Even though Chu Feng was a person of the younger generation, everyone knew that he was an extraordinary person of the younger generation.

He was someone who held an extremely high status in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

He was the most terrifying existence in the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Not only did he possess outstanding talent, and was the strongest genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he had even managed to, through the use of a treasure that increased his cultivation, suppress the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief as a person of the younger generation in the battle against the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Most importantly, standing behind him were the Three Cities.
