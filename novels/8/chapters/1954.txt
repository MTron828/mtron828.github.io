Chapter 1954 - Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade

As such, this issue was determined. Originally, it was decided that the Compass Immortal would set off for the Heavenly Road’s exit after some time.

However, no one expected that the Compass Immortal was extremely impatient, and left for the Eastern Sea Region’s Heavenly Road’s exit to wait for the appearance of the spatial crack right after the banquet. Before he left, he had only mentioned that he was leaving to Baili Xuankong.

Chu Feng did not just sit around after the Compass Immortal left. He planned to enter closed-door training to master the Heaven Taboo Martial Skill that Long Lin had given him.

Long Lin was someone from the Outer World. Even if the Heaven Taboo Martial Skill which he had given was not extremely good, it remained that it was a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill from the Outer World. As such, Chu Feng felt that it would most definitely be a quality Heaven Taboo Martial Skill.

As for the truth, it was exactly as Chu Feng had anticipated. That Heaven Taboo Martial Skill was extremely powerful. In fact... it was even more powerful than Chu Feng’s Profound Firmament Annihilation. It was a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill of the highest quality.

That Heaven Taboo Martial Skill’s name was the Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade. Once the blade was unleashed, it would split through the void and destroy all living things.

Merely by looking at its introduction and the method of learning it, Chu Feng was able to feel how powerful that Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade was.

To Chu Feng’s greatest surprise, the creator of that Void Splitting Blade was actually Long Lin.

However, there was a flaw to that Heaven Taboo Martial Skill. That was that its true power could only be unleashed through Imperial Armaments.

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still felt that he had to grasp that Heaven Taboo Martial Skill. If he didn’t, it would simply be a waste. Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that he would sooner or later be able to obtain an Imperial Armament.

Afterward, Chu Feng immersed himself in learning the Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade.

The Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade was extremely hard to learn, and even unsuitable for the majority of people. This was especially true when one didn’t possess an Imperial Armament. In that situation, learning that Void Splitting Blade was simply akin to trying to scale the heavens.

However, such a thing was unable to hinder Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng had obtained a completely new understanding of martial skills through that Ancient Era’s Bamboo Slip. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, even with that being the case, it still took Chu Feng an entire month to grasp the Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade.

However, over the course of that month, Chu Feng had not only grasped the Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade; he had also managed to create a method to learn the Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade without the possession of Imperial Armaments. With that method, it would be much easier for others to learn that Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade.

“Ancestor.”

After Chu Feng left his closed-door training, he immediately went to search for Baili Xuankong.

“Chu Feng, you’ve left your closed-door training? Could it be that you’ve succeeded?” Baili Xuankong was very surprised to see Chu Feng, and even more surprised to see how joyful Chu Feng was. The reason for that was because it very likely meant that Chu Feng had succeeded.

That said, for Chu Feng to be able to master a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill in a month’s time came as both a shock and a delight to Baili Xuankong.

“I’ve succeeded. This Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade is truly worthy of being a martial skill from the Outer World. It is extremely powerful. I believe... there would rarely be any martial skill in the Holy Land of Martialism that could contend against it. With this martial skill in hand, I will have one more hidden trump card when fighting against others.”

“However...”

“However?” Baili Xuankong asked.

“However, this martial skill required the possession an Imperial Armament in order to fully unleash its might. Else... the might of this Heaven Taboo: Void Splitting Blade would even be inferior to that of my Profound Firmament Annihilation,” Chu Feng said.

“If that’s the case, you really will have to make for the Eastern Sea Region as soon as possible. After all, the Imperial Armaments in the Holy Land of Martialism are limited in quantity. Practically all of the Imperial Armaments already possess owners.”

Baili Xuankong already knew that the Eastern Sea Region’s Nine Provinces Continent not only possessed Qing Xuantian’s remnant, it also possessed the Imperial Armament Qing Xuantian had left behind.

“If it’s only an Imperial Armament, I do not necessarily have to return to the Eastern Sea Region to obtain one,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Why’s that? Could it be that you planned to snatch someone else’s Imperial Armament?” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Baili Xuankong immediately urged against it, “Not a single one of those who possess Imperial Armaments are easy to handle. With your current strength, it is best that you do not go and provoke them.”

“Ancestor, have you forgotten that I’ve obtained the inheritance of the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King? Even though he did not pass his strength to me, I was given all that he had acquired throughout his lifetime. Not only were there cultivation resources, there’s also an Imperial Armament.”

“Thus, before returning to the Eastern Sea Region, I could make a trip to the Moonlight Maze first,” Chu Feng said.

“Will of the heavens! This is the will of the heavens!” After hearing what Chu Feng said, Baili Xuankong suddenly started laughing.

“Ancestor, what’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked.

“This is most definitely the will of the heavens,” Baili Xuankong said through his laughter.

Later on, Baili Xuankong informed Chu Feng of what had happened. It turned out that not long after Chu Feng entered closed-door training, news of someone spreading a map of the Moonlight Maze had arrived.

Currently, practically all of the major powers and experts in the Holy Land of Martialism had received that map.

Currently, a large group of people were hurrying for the Moonlight Maze. They wanted to rely on that map to charge into the Moonlight Maze. After all, the Moonlight Maze was a place that was filled with treasures.

However, that was only one piece of news. Just yesterday, Baili Xuankong had received another news. As for that news, it was related to Chu Feng.

One of the Ancient Era’s Elves’ geniuses, Xian Yuyin, had actually found Zhang Tianyi and challenged him for his title of the strongest younger generation.

Furthermore, he had successfully defeated Zhang Tianyi. And right now... Xian Yuyin had announced that he would openly challenge Chu Feng. He announced that he would wait for Chu Feng outside of the Moonlight Maze, and would compete with him for the title of the strongest younger generation there.

He wanted to let the people of the Holy Land of Martialism know that only their Ancient Era’s Elves were qualified to hold the title of the strongest younger generation.

“Xian Yuyin, he is truly a stubborn one,” After hearing about this matter, Chu Feng was immediately angered.

He knew that, with Xian Yuyin’s strength, he would have been able to easily defeat Zhang Tianyi long ago should he have wanted to do so.

However, he only challenged Zhang Tianyi now. It was clear that he had done so not because of Zhang Tianyi, nor was it for the title of the Holy Land of Martialism’s strongest younger generation.

Rather, his target was Chu Feng. He had done this to challenge Chu Feng.

Xian Yuyin knew that Zhang Tianyi was Chu Feng’s brother. That was the reason why he had defeated Zhang Tianyi. He had done so for the sake of enraging Chu Feng and forcing Chu Feng to fight against him.

“Ancestor, does Lord Lianghua know about this matter concerning Xian Yuyin?” Chu Feng asked.

“He already knows. Lord Lianghua has said that Xian Yuyin is in the wrong, and hopes that you will be able to teach Xian Yuyin a lesson,” Baili Xuankong said with a smile. He was very happy that Lord Lianghua was standing on Chu Feng’s side.

“In that case, I really do have to teach him a lesson,” Chu Feng narrowed his eyes.

Back in the Elf Kingdom, Xian Yuyin had deliberately tried to make things difficult for Chu Feng on more than one occasion. Chu Feng had not done anything to him back then because he had been giving the Ancient Era’s Elves face.

However, never would Chu Feng have thought that Xian Yuyin would be this unreasonable. Even after his father had been forced to enter closed-door training, forced into a house arrest, Xian Yuyin actually still had the nerve to cause trouble.

As such, Chu Feng absolutely could not ignore Xian Yuyin anymore. He had to teach that Xian Yuyin a lesson. Else, he would most definitely continue to do this sort of thing in the future.

Not to mention Lord Lianghua supporting him, even if Lord Lianghua had been against it, Chu Feng would still teach Xian Yuyin a lesson.

As for that, it was for no reason other than the fact that Zhang Tianyi was Chu Feng’s friend, Chu Feng’s brother. As such, Chu Feng had to teach Xian Yuyin a lesson.

“Chu Feng, merely... the map of the Moonlight Maze would not have been spread for no reason or cause.”

“We think that it is most definitely the actions of the Dark Hall. We do not know what sort of scheme the Dark Hall has in mind. If you are to go, I’m afraid...” Even though Baili Xuankong also hoped for Chu Feng to teach Xian Yuyin a lesson, he was worried for Chu Feng’s safety at the same time.

“If it’s the Dark Hall, Ancestor, you can rest assured. If they wanted to kill me, they would’ve already done so,” Chu Feng said.

“But... it remains that they possess the intention to kill you,” Baili Xuankong said.

“Ancestor, do you think that I am a fish on a chopping block, someone that can be trampled upon at any opportunity?” Chu Feng asked.

“No. While that might be possible for anyone else, you, boy, are definitely not someone to be taken advantage of,” Baili Xuankong understood Chu Feng’s intentions. Chu Feng possessed a cautious temperament. As such, it was very difficult for him to end up being taken advantage of again should he be taken advantage of once already.
