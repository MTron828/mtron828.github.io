After Chu Feng and Long Nanxun left, Elder Lingtao and the others, who were kneeling in midair all this while, quickly rose back to their feet.

All of their complexions didn’t look too good. Even though they were elders of the Dragon Clan, Exalted Martial-level experts, all of them had horrified looks on their faces right now.

It was almost as if they had seen a ghost.

Elder Lingtao was the first one to calm down from the shock, and a conflicted look surfaced in his eyes.

“Elder Lingtao, what should we do? How did Long Nanxun suddenly obtain Lord Clan Chief’s personal token? Did something happen while we weren’t looking?” an elder asked worriedly.

They were all subordinates of Long Mumu and her mother, so their fate had already been tied together with theirs. If Long Mumu and her mother were to lose power, they would be the next to suffer.

As such, they couldn’t help but be deeply worried about how the Clan Chief Token ended up falling into Long Nanxun’s hands, especially since Long Nanxun was known to be one of Long Xiaoxiao’s people.

“That’s impossible,” Elder Lingtao replied.

“What do you think is going on then?” the other elders asked.

“Long Nanxun is a slave to love. There’s nothing he wouldn’t do for Long Xiaoxiao. It’s just that it shouldn’t be possible for someone of his standing to obtain the Clan Chief Token...” Elder Lingtao analyzed.

“Elder Lingtao, do you mean to say that Long Nanxun stole the Clan Chief Token? But with his strength, it shouldn’t be possible for him to steal Lord Clan Chief’s personal token!” the other elders exclaimed.

“There’s no one in the Dragon Clan who dares to disrespect the Clan Chief Token. None of you paid close attention to the token earlier, right?”

Instead of replying directly, Elder Lingtao posed another question to the elders instead.

“So, there’s a good chance that the token might have been forged?”

The elders widened their eyes in realization.

The token did look authentic to them, but just like Elder Lingtao had said, they hadn’t gotten an opportunity to get a close look at it.

Now that they thought about it, it wasn’t entirely impossible for the token to be fake.

“I wouldn’t eliminate such a possibility,” Elder Lingtao replied.

“If that’s the case, Long Nanxun is a goner. The act of forging Lord Clan Chief’s insignia of authority is a heinous crime that warrants the execution of him and all of his direct kin!” an elder remarked.

“There’s no saying that Long Xiaoxiao might even be the mastermind behind this,” Elder Lingtao added as his lips curled up into a sinister smile.

There was no one present who didn’t get what Elder Lingtao was driving at.

If that token really was a fake, then chances were likely that it was the sole doing of the reckless Long Nanxun, in which case, they wouldn’t be able to implicate Long Xiaoxiao.

However, it would be perfectly reasonable too for them to claim that Long Nanxun had done it under the orders of Long Xiaoxiao. As long as they insisted on it, it would be hard for them to refute this matter.

Perhaps they might even be able to make use of this opportunity to overthrow Long Xiaoxiao for good.

“Elder Lingtao, what should we do then?” someone asked.

“Report this matter to Princess Mumu and Lord Princess. They’ll know what to do,” Elder Lingtao said.

“Understood!”

Right after those words were spoken, someone immediately flitted into the distance to inform Long Mumu and her mother of this matter.

...

Chu Feng and Long Nanxun were fast on their way to the Moongazing Gazebo.

Beside a lake, there was a mountain. On the mountain, there were beautiful cherry blossom trees in full bloom. By the cliff of the mountain, there was a pink gazebo.

And that was the Moongazing Gazebo.

At this very moment, there was a lady seated in the Moongazing Gazebo, looking toward the sky. She seemed to be deep in thought.

This lady was none other than Long Xiaoxiao.

“Xiaoxiao!”

Long Nanxun could hardly curb his excitement when he finally saw Long Xiaoxiao once more. Even while they were still a distance away, he was already shouting for her.

Hearing a voice calling for her, Long Xiaoxiao also turned around at this moment.

It was just that at the moment Long Xiaoxiao’s face appeared before their eyes, both Chu Feng and Long Nanxun’s faces warped in shock. They couldn’t help but feel a deep ache in their hearts.

The current Long Xiaoxiao had a ghastly pale face, and her body was frighteningly emaciated too. Even her adorable face looked a little aged.

The youthfulness and vibrance that one used to be able to see in her had vanished without a trace, and her eyes were completely spiritless.

Just from the redness of her eyes, it was hard to imagine just how many times she had cried to herself over the days.

But one thing was for certain: Long Xiaoxiao’s current state wasn’t just a product of her sorrow.

“Little benefactor, what are you doing here?”

Long Xiaoxiao was surprised to see Long Nanxun and Chu Feng here. Her lips even curled slightly from delight.

Her smile was still as sweet as ever, and it returned some youthful vibrance to her face.

“Xiaoxiao, what happened to you? What did they do to you?” Long Nanxun asked in horror.

He was convinced that this was the doing of Long Lingtao and the others, and the sheer anger he felt caused killing intent to flow from his body.

On the other hand, Chu Feng didn’t ask any questions. Instead, he walked over to Long Xiaoxiao’s side, grabbed her wrist, and began to diagnose her condition.

“Why did you practice a forbidden martial skill? You even consumed a forbidden medicine?” Chu Feng asked Long Xiaoxiao.

“You are still as formidable as ever, little benefactor. You were actually able to see through that,” Long Xiaoxiao replied with a smile.

“Forbidden martial skill? Forbidden medicine?”

Upon hearing these words, Long Nanxun seemed to have understood something, and he directed a grudging yet pained look toward Long Xiaoxiao.

“Xiaoxiao, why are you so foolish? Even if you want to save Lord Zhaoyue, you still can’t treat yourself in such a manner!” Long Nanxun cried out.

“I thought that I might be able to win my father’s favor if I were to surpass Long Mumu in terms of cultivation. I would be able to plead for mercy for my mother, and perhaps, my father would finally release her. But I was useless,” Long Xiaoxiao said in self-reproach.

“Xiaoxiao, you need not do this. We have a way to save Lord Zhaoyue now,” Long Nanxun said.

“What ways could there be?” Long Xiaoxiao replied nonchalantly.

She didn’t seem to have much confidence in Long Nanxun. It was not that she looked down on Long Nanxun, but she simply knew him too well.

This was a problem which even she was helpless before, so what could Long Nanxun possibly be able to do?

His means didn’t reach that far.

“There’s really a way out of this. Chu Feng might just be able to save Lord Zhaoyue!” Long Nanxun said.

“Little benefactor?”

Upon hearing those words, Long Xiaoxiao immediately turned her gaze to Chu Feng. In her lifeless eyes, a small spark of hope blossomed.
