Chapter 4442: Aweing Everyone

“Young master Chu Feng, I know that I, Yin Daifen, has let you down on many counts, but I was really unaware that you have saved Elder Gongsun before. If I had known, I would have surely not acted so disrespectfully to you. I ask you to forgive me for my folly,” Yin Daifen said.

The two of them appeared to be very sincere in their apologies.

However, Chu Feng simply smiled faintly in response, not saying anything at all.

From the first time they met, Chu Feng had already told Yin Daifen that he was acquainted with her elder sister. Yet, how did she treat him?

However, Chu Feng was too used to seeing such hypocrisy that he couldn’t even be bothered to refute them. On the account of Elder Gongsun, he chose to accept their apology.

And with that, the Yu Heavenly Clan was placed in a very awkward position.

It was just a moment ago that the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was standing on their side, giving them the confidence to stand against the Dragon Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple.

However, now that the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had changed sides, if the Yu Heavenly Clan still insisted on dealing with Chu Feng, they would have to face the wrath of three colossuses of the Holy Light Galaxy.

There was no way they could stand a chance at all.

Even if they did, they also wouldn’t dare to make things difficult for Chu Feng either, especially after learning that he was on good terms with the Lady of Dao Sea.

They might still consider offending the Cloudsky Immortal Sect and the others, but when it came to the Lady of Dao Sea, they didn’t dare to make this gamble at all.

However, as it happened, there were simply too many important things in the Cosmos Sack that Yu Hong had given to Chu Feng. If they really gave it away just like that, they would be letting down their predecessors.

As a result of these factors at play, they found themselves in a quandary.

“Yu Heavenly Clan, are you still intending on getting your Cosmos Sack back?” a voice dripped in sarcasm suddenly sounded.

It was from the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster.

After everything that had happened, the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster looks visibly more relaxed than before. With eyes narrowed tightly, he eyed the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with a mocking smile on his lips.

He wanted to see how the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would get themself out of this farce. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the crowd from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect also turned their gazes over. There was a hint of ridicule in their eyes.

All of this heaped a mountain load of pressure onto the shoulders of those from the Yu Heavenly Clan.

They didn’t think that the tables would turn on them just like that. It was just a moment ago that they had the upper hand, but before they knew it, they found themselves cornered like a dog against a wall.

In this crucial moment, it was the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief who stepped forward and broke the silence.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you can keep the treasures inside the Cosmos Sack. However, the Exalted Taboo Martial Skills in there are the heritage of our Yu Heavenly Clan. It mustn’t be leaked out to others. May I ask you to return them?”

This time around, the attitude of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was vastly different from before. He was neither domineering nor lofty anymore. Instead, he spoke with a negotiating tone, reminiscent of a person asking an equal for a favor.

“Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, if you had been willing to talk about this from the start, I, Chu Feng, would have considered giving back your items. But what did you do instead? As soon as the opportunity arose, you tried to claim my life.

“If not for the protection of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, I would have already been killed by your hands. While I’m fortunate to still be alive and breathing at the moment, there’s no denying that you have made an attempt on my life.

“To put it more directly, you are an enemy of mine right now. Why should I bother trying to empathize with you?” Chu Feng replied sharply.

“Wonderful, young friend Chu Feng. Well said!” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster clapped as he roared in approval.

“Young friend Chu Feng’s words carry some truth. Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, I know that you have your difficulties over there, but young friend Chu Feng is perfectly justified in turning down your request,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief added on.

After the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had changed their stance, he had nothing to fear anymore.

To be honest, even if the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had still chosen to stand against Chu Feng, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief would still have been willing to back Chu Feng up.

The reason was no other than the relation Chu Feng had with the Lady of Dao Sea. If they could strike up even the slightest connection with the Lady of Dao Sea, it would be all worth it.

“Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, did you really try to kill Chu Feng earlier?”

Compared to the mocking tone that the others took, Elder Gongsun’s gaze turned sharp and cold as he questioned.

It wasn’t just him. Even the looks which Liu Chengkong and Zhao Chunqiu were directing toward the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief were swiftly growing colder.

Standing in the face of such terrifying looks, the crowd from the Yu Heavenly Clan was swiftly losing their nerves.

They didn’t know much about the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, but their earlier show of might was more than enough to drive in the fact that they were a terrifyingly powerful colossus.

Earlier, they were willing to mobilize such a tremendous force and unhesitatingly wage war against the Dragon Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple just because their juniors suffered some grievances.

And right now, Chu Feng was the benefactor of one of the elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.

There was no saying that the Cloudsky Immortal Sect might really make a move against them for the sake of Chu Feng.

It was in this incredibly tense moment that a young man amidst the crowd of the Yu Heavenly Clan suddenly shouted, “Chu Feng, do you dare to have a fight with me?”

This young man had a dark complexion. Despite his well-toned body, he appeared to be in a bad physical condition, as if he was plagued with some sort of illness.

“Yu Lie?”

Surprisingly, the action of this young man caused quite a huge commotion amidst the crowd. Even Long Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but be astonished.

Seeing such a response from the crowd, Chu Feng could tell that this young man had quite a notable background, so he began to examine the young man carefully.

“Little benefactor, don’t cross hands with him.”

Before Chu Feng could respond, Long Xiaoxiao had already sent a voice transmission over to him.

From Long Xiaoxiao’s explanation, Chu Feng learned that Yu Lie was a junior whose name had spread far and wide in the Holy Light Galaxy. The latter was publicly recognized to be the strongest junior in the Yu Heavenly Clan.

Even Long Xiaoxiao had witnessed his splendor once before.

So, how exactly powerful was Yu Lie?

Even thirty years ago, his cultivation had already reached rank seven Utmost Exalted level. The only ones who could put up a fight against him back then were the prodigies from the Holy Light Clan.

In fact, twenty years ago, he was just a step away from reaching rank eight Utmost Exalted level.

But from then on, he suddenly vanished from public view. Rumors had it that he had gone into closed-door training, and it was only today that he was finally appearing in public once more.

The current Yu Lie had changed a lot from the Yu Lie twenty years ago. He didn’t have the sharpness that he used to command, and he looked a lot thinner than before. Even his appearance had changed a fair bit.

It was due to this that no one noticed him amongst the crowd of the Yu Heavenly Clan initially.

On top of that, he appeared to be a little sickly.

That being said, there was no denying that Yu Lie was a powerful cultivator who was on the verge of reaching rank eight Utmost Exalted level twenty years ago. After the passing of so many years, it was likely that he had already taken the final step forward to make a breakthrough.

There was no way any juniors present here would be a match for him.

It was due to this that Long Xiaoxiao quickly advised Chu Feng against accepting the challenge too.

“Chu Feng, my cultivation is currently at rank seven Utmost Exalted level. I know that you’re currently weaker than me, but if you’re willing to cross hands with me, I won’t use my Lightning Mark to raise my cultivation. I’ll fight with you with just my current cultivation level.

“If I were to lose this battle, my life will be yours to take. However, if I were to win this battle, I hope that you can return the Exalted Taboo Martial Skills of our Yu Heavenly Clan,” Yu Lie said.

Everyone was a little shocked to hear Yu Lie’s words, especially the fact that his cultivation was still at rank seven Utmost Exalted level despite the passing of two decades.

This didn’t make sense. Given the talent that he had displayed back then, there was no way he would have been stuck in a bottleneck for so long.

However, his ailing health at the moment also made everyone realize that a mishap might have happened to him twenty years back, causing him to retreat from public view.

Otherwise, given that Yu Lie had already come out of closed-door training and had even journeyed with the Yu Heavenly Clan here, he should have taken one of the slots of the Godwish Palace.

“What a joke. From the very start, it’s your Yu Heavenly Clan that has done wrong, and you still have the cheek to propose a duel?”

“The elders of the Yu Heavenly Clan are at a loss for words, so they decide to send a junior out to speak on your behalf?”

Those from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect began mocking the Yu Heavenly Clan for their actions.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you need not bother about them. With our Cloudsky Immortal Sect standing up for you, the Yu Heavenly Clan won’t be able to do anything to you, be it now or the future! If they dare to even lay a single finger on you, our Cloudsky Immortal Sect will make them pay the price of their foolishness!” Zhao Chunqiu declared loudly.

This sight was truly ironic.

No one could have thought that the person who declared that he would take Chu Feng’s life just a moment ago would actually be backing Chu Feng up at this moment.

“Elder, I appreciate your goodwill, but I’m interested in trading blows with that brother from the Yu Heavenly Clan.”

To everyone’s surprise, Chu Feng actually accepted Yu Lie’s challenge.

Even those from the Yu Heavenly Clan could hardly believe their ears.

What in the world was wrong with Chu Feng’s head?

Even when he was cornered earlier, he refused to hand over the Exalted Taboo Martial Skills. So, why would he suddenly give in now that so many people were backing him up?

This was truly incomprehensible to them.

While everyone was taken aback by those words, Chu Feng spoke up once more, “Also, I don’t need you to hold yourself back. Fight me with your full strength.”

Those words caused the surroundings to plunge into silence.

As if they had been struck by lightning, everyone felt their brains turning into a mushy mess.
