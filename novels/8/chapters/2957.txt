Chapter 2957 - The Legendary Tenth Step

“Impossible! I, Chu Huanyu, refuse to believe this!!!”

Suddenly, Chu Huanyu let out a furious shout. Then, he took two successive steps and directly arrived on the sixth step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.

However, by the time he arrived at the sixth step, his face was completely withered, and he was sweating profusely. His entire body was shivering. He was no longer capable of taking another step onward.

“Ahhh!!!”

Chu Huanyu let out a roar. It was a roar of unwillingness, a roar of unacceptance. He was feeling extremely unreconciled. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He was unreconciled because he refused to believe that Chu Feng was able to ascend to the ninth step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps while he, a genius of a generation, someone who was capable of inheriting the Chu Heavenly Clan in the future, was limited to only the sixth step, and unable to even take a step onto the seventh step.

“Puu~~~”

Following his furious roar, Chu Huanyu sprayed out a mouthful of blood. Then, he fell from the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.

“Huanyu!”

Seeing this, an elder from the Chu Heavenly Clan immediately rushed to catch him.

At that moment, the old man that caught Chu Huanyu revealed a distressed expression while looking at him.

However, he then turned his gaze to Chu Feng.

Through testing the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps with his own body, Chu Huanyu had proved that the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was not a phoney. Instead, it was the real thing. It was the same Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps that they’d all climbed before. It was the same Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps that no one could surmount.

However, Chu Feng was actually standing at the top of such a Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps. Not only that, but even though Chu Feng’s expression was also covered in pain, even though his body was also trembling slightly, he showed no sign of being unable to withstand the pain and pressure of the ninth step.

“That brat, is he truly a demon-level genius?” Seeing this scene, the old man who had caught Chu Huanyu was unable to contain himself from exclaiming in admiration.

His exclamation of admiration confirmed what everyone was thinking in their hearts.

To be able to ascend to the Heavenly Lightning Steps’ ninth step and stand firmly on it, was that really something that a human could accomplish?

Likely, even ‘demon-level genius’ would not be able to describe how frightening Chu Feng was.

“What is Chu Feng thinking about?”

Right at that moment, someone noticed that something seemed amiss with Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had already proved himself by standing on the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps’ ninth step. Not only was he capable of returning to the Chu Heavenly Clan, but he would also receive unprecedented nurture from their Chu Heavenly Clan.

After all, he was someone who had managed to ascend to the ninth step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.

However, not only did Chu Feng not have a joyous expression on his face, but it was instead somewhat lifeless. It seemed as if he were pondering something.

The crowd was puzzled. Exactly what was Chu Feng thinking about?

Chu Feng was indeed thinking about one thing, a thing pertaining to the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng felt that the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps seemed to be missing something.

Actually, Chu Feng had had his suspicions the moment he ascended to the sixth step. When Chu Feng arrived at the ninth step, he had confirmed his suspicions.

This Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was different from the one that his father had him climb before.

If one had to describe the difference, then it would be that the present Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was weaker. Even though this Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was also very powerful, it was much weaker than the one his father had prepared for him to ascend on the Heavenly Road.

That’s right, it was much weaker.

In fact, Chu Feng felt that it was an entire level weaker.

In other words, the ninth step that Chu Feng was currently standing on was only as powerful as the eighth step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps on the Heavenly Road.

With the situation being like this, a thought came to Chu Feng’s mind.

“Could it be... that there’s a tenth step?”

Then, Chu Feng made an unexpected movement. He raised his leg and took another step forward. That location surpassed the edge of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps’ ninth step. It was completely empty. There was nothing there but air.

“What is he trying to do?”

“Could he have been struck dumb by the lightning?”

Everyone was puzzled by Chu Feng’s movement. All sorts of thoughts appeared in their hearts.

“Step~~~”

However, the next moment, an even more astonishing sight appeared. When Chu Feng’s foot landed, it seemed as if it had stepped onto something.

“Zzzzz~~~”

The very next moment, lightning began to appear from under Chu Feng’s foot.

When the lightning appeared, it started to connect with the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps to form another faintly-visible step.

“What’s going on?!”

At that moment, the people of the younger generation were all bewildered.

Even geniuses like Chu Ruoshi and Chu Lingxi were deeply confused.

“It’s the Heavenly Lightning Steps’ tenth step, the legendary tenth step!” Chu Xuanzhengfa shouted loudly. Someone like him had actually lost control of his emotions.

“Tenth step?!”

Hearing those words, the people of the younger generation revealed even greater astonishment. They seemed to have realized something.

At that moment, an old man of the Chu Heavenly Clan that seemed to be a person of virtue and prestige began to gently stroke his beard as he looked at Chu Feng and said, “According to legend, the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps originally possessed ten levels, ten steps. Unfortunately, as no one was capable of ascending to the top, the tenth step disappeared, leaving behind only nine steps.”

“However, if one were to ascend to the ninth step and be capable of continuing onward, the disappeared tenth step would once again awaken.”

“Originally, I’d thought it to only be a legend. Never would I have imagined it to really exist.”

“In that case, would that mean that Chu Feng... has awakened the legendary tenth step?!”

Hearing those words, the people of the younger generation were even more astonished. This was truly too unbelievable. All that Chu Feng had accomplished on this day was simply too unimaginable.
