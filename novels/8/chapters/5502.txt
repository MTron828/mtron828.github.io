Chapter 5502: A Terrifying Power, A Terrifying Person

The one who had roared at Chu Feng was the Totem Phoenix Clan’s prodigy world spiritist, Feng Jiuyue.

“I don’t know what cultivation skill you’re talking about, but you look unaffected by the energy here. You must know the way to alleviate the pain,” Feng Jiuyue said.

The crowd was suffering so much from the pain inflicted by the black aura that they hadn’t paid attention to Chu Feng. It was only after hearing Feng Jiuyue’s words that they turned their eyes over and saw that Chu Feng’s expression was completely impassive as if he was impervious to the black aura.

This was perplexing, considering how the black aura was still flowing into Chu Feng’s body.

“Chu Feng, do you really know another way?” someone from the Totem Dragon Clan asked.

Chu Feng’s composure led them to believe that he knew a way to alleviate the pain caused by the black aura.

However, Long Chengyu stepped in and angrily said, “What’s confusing about this situation? Brother Chu Feng mentioned earlier that the earlier trials are body tempering processes to help us better cope with the energy here. He must have properly gone through the tempering process, which is why he’s unfazed now. Touch your heart, did any of you properly accept the tempering process? You wouldn’t have even known that it was a tempering process if Brother Chu Feng hadn’t said so!”

“Brother Chengyu, Miss Muxi, I want to first clarify that I don’t know what the black aura is either. It could be something beneficial, but it could also be something detrimental. You can choose to continue enduring the trial, but let me know when you reach your limit. I should be able to help you, but that would also mean the black aura has nothing to do with you anymore, for better or for worse,” Chu Feng said.

He had stepped onto the pedestal to save the two of them, as well as the others from the Totem Dragon Clan, so he only needed to seek their agreement.

“Chu Feng, are you planning to use that cultivation skill of yours to absorb all of the black aura here by yourself?” Long Muxi asked worriedly.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Yes, but I should be able to take it since I properly underwent the tempering process,” Chu Feng said.

“That won’t do. You already gave up on the trial. This matter no longer has anything to do with you. We were the ones who chose this, so we should be the ones to bear the responsibility for our decision,” Long Muxi said adamantly.

She didn’t want Chu Feng to take the risk, especially since she could sense how terrifying the black aura was. Not even a man made out of iron would be able to withstand this! This was no different from him sacrificing himself to save others!

“Chu Feng, my big sister is right. We were the ones who made this choice, so we should be the ones to bear the responsibility,” Long Chengyu agreed.

Seeing how insistent they were, Chu Feng tried examining the pedestal to see if there were any other alternatives to clear this trial, but he was unable to find anything of use. Time passed, and the eerie cries became more jarring. At the same time, the black aura also swiftly proliferated.

It didn’t take long for Long Chengyu and Long Muxi’s complexion to turn awful. The others couldn’t even remain on their feet. One by one, they crumbled to the floor as their bodies spasmed. They would surely die at this rate.

“Young master, I’m reaching my limit. Please have young master Chu Feng make a move if he can save us!” The Totem Dragon Clansmen pleaded with Long Chengyu.

They didn’t bother begging Chu Feng because they knew that Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were the only ones who could prompt Chu Feng into action.

“Young hero, please save us. I’m willing to offer all of my treasures to you!”

Outsiders also begged Chu Feng as well, some even going to the extent of tossing their Cosmos Sacks over. They did doubt Chu Feng at the start, but his predictions had all come true, and he was the only one who remained unfazed in the midst of the black aura.

This was more than enough to prove that he wasn’t all words.

But again, they knew that Chu Feng wasn’t obliged to save them, which was why they offered him their Cosmos Sacks as a gesture of goodwill.

“Brother Chengyu, are you still able to hold on?” Chu Feng asked Long Chengyu.

“Brother Chu Feng, I can still hold on.”

Long Chengyu squeezed out a smile, but it looked awfully unnatural. He was feeling conflicted. It was not a lie when he said that he could still hold on, but it was clear that his fellow clansmen had already reached their limits.

He was inclined to ask Chu Feng to make a move, but how could he tell the latter to take the pain on their behalf? This was unfair to Chu Feng, not to mention that it was a very dangerous move.

This put him in a dilemma.

Chu Feng could tell that he was put in a spot, so he turned to the outsiders and said, “I should be properly compensated if you want me to save you. Bring out your possessions, and I’ll give it a try. I can’t guarantee that you’ll be able to leave the Demon Crane safely, but at least you will be spared from the black aura’s torture.”

“Young hero, we’ll do anything as long as you help us!”

Many people unhesitatingly threw their Cosmos Sacks toward Chu Feng. Chu Feng accepted their items before channeling his cultivation skill.

The entire palace trembled.

A brilliant white light shone from Chu Feng’s body, making him shine like a torch in the midst of the dark night, bringing hope to the crowd.

Chu Feng quickly formed a series of hand seals, and the white light around him manifested into runes that expanded outward. However, the light only enveloped the Totem Dragon Clan and those who had offered him benefits.

Wherever the white light enveloped, the black aura was siphoned off toward Chu Feng. As the black aura left the crowd’s bodies, their conditions began to improve.

“Young hero, save me too! Save me too!”

More and more people tossed their Cosmos Sacks to Chu Feng. There were even some who gave up on their Exalted Armament and treasures. Those who were unsure earlier knew right now that Chu Feng did have the power to save them.

“Calm down. I’ll do my job as long as you fork out the money.”

Chu Feng was a man of his word. As long as one offered him treasures, he would channel his cultivation skill to take their share of the black aura.

“Young master, please save us.”

Eventually, those from the Totem Phoenix Clan also threw their treasures to Chu Feng too, but he rejected them.

“Is the Totem Phoenix Clan that stingy?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young master, the treasures we offered you are no less than theirs in value!” a Totem Phoenix Clansman exclaimed.

“It’s only at times like this that the Totem Phoenix Clansman tries to put themself on the same pedestal as others. Don’t be stingy. Show some sincerity if you want me to save you,” Chu Feng scoffed.

“Are you fleecing us?!” Feng Tiansheng roared.

“That’s right. I’m fleecing you. Give me all of your Cosmos Sacks. I also expect at least one Exalted Armament from each of you. Otherwise, you can find a way out of this yourself,” Chu Feng said.

“You!!!”

Feng Tiansheng was going to lash out at Chu Feng, but a hand pressed down on his shoulder. It was Feng Jiuyue. The latter took out her Cosmos Sack and threw it over to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng took a look at the Cosmos Sack—it contained two Exalted Armaments of the highest quality, together with many invaluable treasures.

After Feng Jiuyue made a move, the other Totem Phoenix Clansmen also proceeded to hand over their Cosmos Sacks too, each one containing at least an Exalted Armament.

“It looks like your big sister is much smarter than you,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

He finally expanded the white light to envelop the entire pedestal, forming a sight where two different powers, one white and white black, clashed against each other. It was a magnificent sight.

Chu Feng took in a deep breath, closed his eyes, and gritted his teeth. He changed his hand seals.

Gwah!

Black aura suddenly gushed out of the pedestal at a quantity several hundred times more than before, looking almost like a volcano eruption. This would have been fatal to everyone on the pedestal, but it was all flowing toward a single person.

What was even more shocking was that this person didn’t even let out a cry. His face scrunched up a little, but it didn’t look like he was anywhere near his limit. Chu Feng was actually able to withstand all of the terrifying black aura on his own!

This sight shocked everyone. They knew how terrifying the black aura was, which was why they understood how incredible of a feat this was.

“Is that fellow a monster?” Feng Tiansheng muttered in a daze.

Even he was shocked by Chu Feng.
