Chapter 2752 - What Is Fake Cannot Be Real

“Crystal Invitation Title Plate?”

Seeing the invitation title plate in his hand, Chu Feng was surprised. No matter how he looked at it, this invitation title plate did not resemble crystal. Instead, it was more like glass.

However, Li Xiang and his two companions’ reactions didn’t seem to be a pretense. It would appear that the invitation title plate Chu Feng possessed was quite extraordinary.

As they say, one can’t judge a person just by their appearance. It would appear that invitation title plates were the same.

“Brother, where did you obtain your Crystal Invitation Title Plate? Did the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan give that to you?”

Upon seeing Chu Feng’s invitation title plate, the other two men from the Sacred Pellet Villa immediately moved toward Chu Feng eagerly. There was a one-hundred and eighty degree change in their attitude. Likely, they had realized that Chu Feng was an extraordinary individual.

However, right at the moment when Chu Feng was about to answer them, Li Xiang said, “How could someone like him possibly obtain a Crystal Invitation Title Plate? The way I see it, it is most definitely a fake.”

As Li Xiang said those words, he also walked over to Chu Feng and began to inspect his invitation title plate carefully. He placed his face very close to the invitation title plate, to the point where his eyes were about to touch it.

“It must be said that this fake is made very well. However, a fake will remain a fake. You will not be able to deceive me, Li Xiang,” Li Xiang said with his mouth wide open.

As he said those words, he even raised his head to glance at Chu Feng. Disdain filled his eyes.

“Big brother Li Xiang, is it really a fake?” The two men asked.

“Of course it’s a fake. How could I be mistaken?” Li Xiang spoke in a very proud manner. After he finished saying those words, he looked to Chu Feng and spoke with a lecturing tone, “What is real cannot be fake, and what is fake cannot be real. If you wish to use that fake invitation title plate to deceive the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan, you are truly mistaken. I urge you not to do something as foolish as that.”

At that moment, the other two men from the Sacred Pellet Villa immediately distanced themselves from Chu Feng. Furthermore, they both glanced at Chu Feng disdainfully.

Chu Feng felt very helpless in this situation. However, he was disinclined to bother explaining it to them. Instead, his body shifted, and he began to fly toward the entrance of the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.

“Hey! You’re really going there? Are you trying to die? You’re trying to deceive the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan with a fake invitation title plate? Have you given up on living?”

“The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan is very fierce!” Li Xiang shouted.

He was shouting very loudly. It seemed as if he were deliberately trying to have the people from the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan hear his words.

Li Xiang succeeded. The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen heard him. Involuntarily, those clansmen stationed by the entrance turned their gazes toward Chu Feng.

That being said, Chu Feng firmly believed that the invitation title plate given to him by the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master must be real. Thus, Chu Feng had no intention of stopping. He only stopped flying and descended to the ground when he reached the entrance.

“Please show your invitation title plate. Those without an invitation title plate are not allowed to enter,” An Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansman spoke with a very deep, resounding and powerful voice.

Chu Feng didn’t say anything. He directly took out his invitation title plate.

That Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansman received Chu Feng’s title plate. Perhaps due to Li Xiang’s loud shout, the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen present were skeptical that Chu Feng was trying to deceive his way through using a fake invitation title plate. Thus, they inspected it very carefully.

However, in the end, they returned the invitation title plate to Chu Feng and, with a very respectful tone, they said, “Please enter.”

At that moment, Li Xiang and his two companions had also landed. The three of them managed to clearly witness that scene.

“Holy crap, he actually managed to enter.”

“Big brother Li Xiang, didn’t you say that invitation title plate was fake?” Li Xiang’s two companions turned to ask him.

“I truly never expected his invitation title plate was capable of passing as genuine even though it’s fake.”

“It is truly a pity. He has managed to deceive the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan. However, he is unable to deceive me, Li Xiang. A fake cannot be real, and what is real cannot be fake. I said it’s fake; it’s definitely fake,” Li Xiang sighed and spoke in a very certain manner.

However, the expressions of those two men from the Sacred Pellet Villa had changed. They’d started to become skeptical of Li Xiang.

However, Li Xiang ignored the change in their expressions. He was extremely confident in himself.

Just like that, Li Xiang and his two companions also arrived before the entrance. Furthermore, they all took out their respective invitation title plates and handed them to the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen.

Li Xiang’s two companions managed to pass through the inspection successfully.

However, when it was Li Xiang’s turn, Li Xiang was stopped.

“Where did you obtain your invitation title plate?” The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen stared at Li Xiang in a very ill-intended manner.

“What’s wrong? Is there a problem?” Li Xiang asked. His eyes were flickering. He was panicky.

“That invitation title plate of yours is fake,” The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen said.

“Ah? For real?” At that moment, Li Xiang’s two companions ran over.

“Please inspect it carefully again. We are from the Sacred Pellet Villa. We wouldn’t use a fake invitation title plate,” The two men spoke on Li Xiang’s behalf. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“This year, we have given the Sacred Pellet Villa a Crystal Invitation Title Plate, five Golden Invitation Title Plates and twenty Silver Invitation Title Plates.”

“Disregarding you three, twenty-three individuals from the Sacred Pellet Villa have already entered.”

“Among them was a single Crystal Invitation Title Plate, five Golden Invitation Title Plates and seventeen Silver Invitation Title Plates.”

“Even if the three of you are all from the Sacred Pellet Villa, you all should all be carrying Silver Invitation Title Plates. How could it be possible for there to be another Golden Invitation Title Plate?” The Ancient Era’s War Clansmen said.

“Big brother Li Xiang, you...?” At that moment, the two men from the Sacred Pellet Villa both looked to Li Xiang. Suspicion filled their eyes.

“I... I...” Li Xiang revealed an awkward expression.

“Hahahaha...” Right at that moment, laughter was suddenly heard.

It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had already passed through the spirit formation entrance and entered the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.

Chu Feng had his back facing Li Xiang and his two companions. He held his Crystal Invitation Title Plate in one hand and waved with his other hand, “What is real cannot be fake, what is fake cannot be real. Brother, you should be honest.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he soared into the sky and began to fly deep into the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.

Only his invitation title plate-holding back was visible as his clothes fluttered about in the wind.

To Li Xiang, it was an extremely taunting image.

“This guy!”

At that moment, Li Xiang was gnashing his teeth furiously. However, there was nothing he could do.

He actually felt what Chu Feng said to be very correct. Before him was the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen. They belonged to the extremely fierce Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan. Before them, one must not mess around.

“I’m sorry, I was deceived by others. I bought this invitation title plate from an auction. I never expected that the auction would deceive me,” Li Xiang spoke with an expression of grievance on his face.

At that moment, the two men from the Sacred Pellet Villa were looking to Li Xiang was gazes filled with contempt.

They became certain that Li Xiang’s Golden Invitation Title Plate was a fake.

It was nothing serious to have a fake invitation title plate. However, they were unable to tolerate how Li Xiang was using his fake invitation title plate to show off before them.

“If you do not possess an invitation title plate, leave immediately. Otherwise, do not blame us for being rude,” The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen spoke in a very annoyed manner.

“No, I have one, I have one.” Li Xiang took out another invitation title plate. That invitation title plate was silver, the same as his two companions.

“Go on in,” The Ancient Era’s Serpent Clansmen were able to determine that the invitation title plate was real immediately. However, they still warned Li Xiang with a displeased tone, “However, we will be confiscating your fake invitation title plate.”

“Furthermore, if you are to come here using a fake invitation title plate again, you will not be as lucky.”

“Yes, yes, yes. I wouldn’t dare again, I wouldn’t dare again,” Li Xiang promptly apologized.

However, in the end, he had managed to successfully enter the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.

However, by the time he had entered the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain, Chu Feng had already flown far away. He had disappeared deep into the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. They were unable to even catch sight of him.

“Damn it, that guy actually managed to catch sight of my embarrassment and ridiculed me,” Li Xiang spoke in a very displeased manner.

“Big brother Li Xiang, didn’t you say that invitation title plate was something that Lord Villa Master gave you?” At that moment, Li Xiang’s two companions started to look at him with ridiculing gazes.

“What’s this?! The two of you are also trying to embarrass me?!” Li Xiang shouted in a very displeased manner.

Being angry to begin with, Li Xiang was now truly furious.

“Haha, of course not. Big brother Li Xiang, don’t be angry. The one that ridiculed you is that guy, and not us.”

The two men immediately smiled apologetically. It could be seen that Li Xiang possessed some status in their hearts.

“Big brother Li Xiang, what are we to do now?” The two men asked.

“What to do? We are naturally going to meet up with Lord Elder and the others. We’ll go and find Lord Elder to help us get revenge and teach that brat that doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth a proper lesson.”

“Else, we will be bullied and humiliated by him just like this,” Li Xiang said.

“Mn, what big brother Li Xiang says is reasonable,” The two men nodded.

After that, the three of them soared into the sky. They flew past vast amounts of trees and began to fly toward the depths of the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.
