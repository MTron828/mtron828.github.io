Chapter 3216 - Entering The Gates Of Hell

“If that main formation is so powerful, why didn’t the Linghu Heavenly Clan directly shut the entrance using it; why did they instead decide to use another formation to blockade it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I...” Puyang Han was still unable to answer Chu Feng. His expression turned uglier and uglier. An intangible sort of pressure was visible on his face.

“If that main formation is so powerful, why didn’t the Linghu Heavenly Clan summon all of the cultivation resources in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm? Why would they even bother to seek out cultivation resources like us?” Chu Feng continued questioning him.

“......”

Puyang Han’s face was now not only ugly, but he was also sweating. He was unable to provide an answer, an explanation, to Chu Feng’s question. He was unable to find the words to refute him.

At that moment, the crowd all began to nod their heads to indicate that what Chu Feng said was very true.

“If you don’t know the reason why, I, Chu Feng, can tell you the reason.”

“Although the Linghu Heavenly Clan has control over the main formation, they don’t have control over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

“If you don’t trust me, Chu Feng, you don’t have to follow me,” after Chu Feng finished saying those words, he pointed his finger toward the spirit formation he set up. Then, he raised his arm.

“Woosh~~~”

A golden light soared into the sky. The golden disk began to quickly fly toward the Holy Spirit Formation of Light’s entrance.

In the beginning, the golden disk did not appear to be peculiar at all. It was still so very small and insignificant.

Being so small, it resembled a leaf falling into a vast ocean as it entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. It looked so very insignificant. In fact, no one even felt that it was capable of gaining any advantage in that lightning formation that sealed the entrance.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng shouted, “Formation, activate!!!”

After shouting, Chu Feng’s body not only began to emit the same sort of golden light as the golden disk, but the expressions of the crowd present had also all changed.

The reason for that was because after Chu Feng shouted for the formation to activate, that tiny disk immediately began to expand in size. In the blink of an eye, it blocked off the entire entrance to the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

The golden disk was translucent. Thus, the crowd was able to see that the disk was immediately met with an attack from the lightning wall that sealed the Holy Spirit Formation of Light’s entrance.

However, that seemingly weak golden disk was simply impregnable. No matter how violently the lightning attacked it, it was still unmoved in the slightest. Steadily, it continued to move toward the Holy Spirit Formation of Light’s entrance.

With the situation being like that, the gathering of countless lightning was being pushed aside by Chu Feng’s spirit formation repeatedly.

At that moment, astonishment filled the crowd’s eyes. They had not expected that seemingly very weak spirit formation to actually be able to withstand the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s lightning formation.

In fact, it was not only the people inside the New Excellence Formation that were shocked. The people on the plaza outside were also unable to remain calm.

“I will say the same thing. Those that trust me can accompany me. I, Chu Feng, will definitely be able to bring you all into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he immediately soared into the sky and began to fly toward the entrance to the Holy Spirit Formation of Light following the golden disk.

After Chu Feng flew over to the golden disk, he raised his hand and pushed onto the golden disk.

At that moment, Chu Feng fused with the golden disk, and the two of them began to emit bright golden light.

At the same time, the speed at which the golden disk was piercing through the wall of lightning also began to increase.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

At that moment, the people below were finally unable to hold themselves back. Like reverse meteors, they all shot straight into the sky.

They followed Chu Feng and flew into the entrance of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

In the blink of an eye, the newcomers from the various powers had all entered the entrance of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light after Chu Feng. Only the people from the Puyang Heavenly Clan were still standing there.

At that moment, everybody from the Puyang Heavenly Clan was looking at Puyang Han.

Many among them were longing to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light like the other newcomers.

It was only because of Puyang Han’s deterrence that they did not join the crowd.

Finally, someone was unable to contain his desire. He said to Puyang Han, “Big brother Puyang Han, that Chu Feng seems to truly possess some capabilities. Should we...?”

“Shut up!!!”

However, before that man could finish his words, he was immediately shouted down by Puyang Han.

“All of you, listen carefully! If you wish to follow Chu Feng into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, I, Puyang Han, will definitely not stop you. However, as long as you enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, never again say that you know me, Puyang Han.”

Puyang Han’s body was trembling as he said those words. The Puyang Heavenly Clansmen were all able to sense the anger and threat in his words.

With the situation being like that, how could any of the Puyang Heavenly Clansmen dare to go against him? Even though they were unwilling, they could only stand there obediently and look on helplessly as Chu Feng and the others continued to move further and further into the sky.

“This...”

Seeing that Chu Feng and the other newcomers had entered the entrance of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan were all extremely uneasy.

At that moment, they all turned their eyes to Linghu Tiemian.

As for Linghu Tiemian, he turned his gaze to the plaza.

He was observing the powers from the four regions.

Sure enough, he was able to see joy on the faces of those people.

Joy, how could they not be joyous? After all, apart from Puyang Han, all of the newcomers from the various powers had accompanied Chu Feng into the entrance.

Upon thinking that their clans’ newcomers would be capable of enjoying the benefits of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, enjoying those cultivation resources, they were all extremely excited.

After all, they knew that this was a very rare opportunity.

“Did you all think that your clans’ juniors following Chu Feng into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light was an enormously beneficial thing?” Linghu Tiemian’s voice shattered the crowd’s joyous mood.

At that moment, their expressions all turned serious, and even cowardly. They were all able to feel Linghu Tiemian’s displeasure.

“I will tell you all this, your clans’ newcomers will not only gain nothing following Chu Feng, but they will instead suffer enormously.”

“Chu Feng will not be bringing them into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. Instead, he’s bringing them to the Gates of Hell,” Linghu Tiemian said.

The crowd were originally confused by Linghu Tiemian’s words.

After all, Chu Feng had already brought the newcomers into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light’s entrance, that was something that they’d all seen. As such, how could he be bringing them into the Gates of Hell?

It was only when lightning suddenly appeared from below Chu Feng and the others that the crowd came to a sudden realization.

At the same time, intense worry filled their eyes.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
