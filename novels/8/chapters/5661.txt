Chapter 5661: Only By Convenience?

“What did I lie to you about, elder?” Chu Feng asked.

“My test shows that you’re Chu Xuanyan’s descendant,” Xia Xingchen replied.

“Elder, are you sure your test is accurate?” Chu Feng replied with an indignant face.

Since he had already denied it earlier, he figured that he should just do it all the way. Otherwise, Xia Xingchen might just attack him if she saw his father as her enemy. On top of that, while he couldn’t be absolutely sure about it, his gut feeling told him that Xia Xingchen was just scaring him and that she didn’t have such a test at all.

Upon seeing Chu Feng’s response, Xia Xingchen smiled and replied, “Haha, I was just joking with you. It’s good to see that you really don’t know Chu Xuanyan. I guess we can work together then.”

Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief. Xia Xingchen was indeed a cunning one, but fortunately, he didn’t fall for her trap.

“Come, I’ll lead the way,” Xia Xingchen said as she pointed out the directions to him.

Soon, they arrived before an inconspicuous rock inside a stone forest. Upon closer inspection, this inconspicuous rock was actually a teleportation formation.

“I stumbled upon this teleportation formation by coincidence. I’m the only one in the entire Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect who knows about it,” Xia Xingchen said gleefully.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s quickly activate it then, elder,” Chu Feng said.

“Brat, can’t you tell that I’m in a severely weakened state now? Stop acting and activate it. You have been to the stone hall, so you must know the way to activate it,” Xia Xingchen said.

Chu Feng quickly used the method he had learned inside the stone hall to activate the teleportation formation. As he had expected, it worked.

A surge of teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng and Xia Xingchen, and they were brought into the stone hall. The two of them ventured deeper into the stone hall and soon stumbled upon the humongous gate.

The humongous gate was even more eye-catching when entering from the entrance.

“Elder, this gate looks extraordinary. It seems to be from the Immemorial Era. Do you know what its use is?” Chu Feng asked.

He had already known that the humongous gate was a teleportation formation linked to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Still, he was curious to know if the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect knew about its true purpose too, since they were in control of this stone hall.

“I don’t know. This remnant wasn’t created by our sect but by someone from the ancient era; we simply unearthed it. We did examine this gate, but we aren’t able to decipher its use or how to activate it. Most important of all, we are unable to carry the gate out of here. Most likely, the creator of this stone hall couldn’t move this gate either but wanted to monopolize it, so he constructed this stone hall around it to conceal it,” Xia Xingchen said.

Her explanation convinced Chu Feng that the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect didn’t know the purpose of the gate, let alone know about its connection to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.

Chu Feng’s current deduction was that the Nine Heavens Secret Domain was actually a teleportation formation from the Immemorial Era that allowed one to travel at a ridiculous speed, moving from the Seven Realms Galaxy to the Heavenly Dome Galaxy in just two hours.

It was a feat that no one would believe.

Of course, this was only Chu Feng’s deduction. He currently only knew so much about the Nine Heaven Secret Domain, after all.

Xia Xingchen walked up to the stone gate at the opposite end of the hall with a stone key in her hand.

The moment Chu Feng saw the stone key, he knew that there was a special method to open the stone gate too.

Xia Xingchen first inserted the stone key in and twisted it, which gave rise to a ‘kacha’ sound. The seal on the stone door loosened, allowing one to push it open. However, she twisted the stone key once more instead, and the stone door released a powerful surge of spirit power that caused the stone door to light up.

It was also then that Xia Xingchen’s complexion started to look awful.

She twisted the key once more, and this time, her movement looked much more laborious than before. Her complexion turned paler, and she even gritted her teeth. She didn’t let out a single noise, but her tensed body and weakening breath told Chu Feng that she was expending her bloodline power to open the stone gate.

Kacha!

She finally completed the third twist of the key.

The stone door released a blinding burst of light, and the runes on its surface began swimming around rapidly like delighted fishes welcoming them.

However, Xia Xingchen was so weakened that she couldn’t even maintain her balance anymore. Chu Feng quickly rushed forward to support her.

“Elder, are you fine?”

“You’re quite a caring one.”

Xia Xingchen’s face was drained of blood, but she looked at Chu Feng with a smirk. Her boisterous personality was rather charming.

“Thank you, elder,” Chu Feng said.

“You need not thank me. I’m also here for the formation inside the stone door. I’d have opened this door even if you refused to work with me. I’m just bringing you along on the way. You’re the one who’s being taken advantage of here,” Xia Xingchen said.

Chu Feng knew that Xia Xingchen was lying. She wasn’t just helping him by convenience.

The first twist of the key opened the stone door, allowing them to enter the premises. The second twist activated the formation within. The third twist, which was the one that had left her so weakened, activated the Immemorial Meditation Method.

She had paid a heavy price for his sake.

Chu Feng knew about it, but he didn’t harp on the matter. Instead, he took out a pill and passed it to her, saying, “Elder, take this pill. It can alleviate your wounded bloodline.”

Xia Xingchen stared at the pill in surprise. She could tell how valuable it was.

“Don’t bother about me. Go in and take a look, though I reckon that you’ll be disappointed. It’s incredibly difficult to grasp the Immemorial Meditation Method,” Xia Xingchen said.

Chu Feng chuckled. He pushed the stone door open, and he felt like a brand new world was lying in front of him. It was a world filled with seven-colored lights that flowed like water. It looked like an illusion created by a world spiritist.

“Brat, you should know what to do since you’re a world spiritist, right?” Xia Xingchen asked.

“Yes, I know.” Chu Feng stepped into the room, sat down, closed his eyes, and formed a hand seal.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

All of the runes swimming inside the hall began surging into Chu Feng’s body like arrows.

Xia Xingchen, who was about to heal herself, widened her eyes in shock. Even her mouth opened agape. This was not her first time here, but she had never seen anyone producing such a phenomenon before.
