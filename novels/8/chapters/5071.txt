Chapter 5071: It’s Useless Even If You Kneel and Beg Me

One of the sleeping chambers of Jiang Kongping’s palace was reserved for Jiang Yuantai’s use. This was under the request of Jiang Yuantai. He wanted to supervise Jiang Kongping’s cultivation, which was why he insisted on staying with the latter.

A recovery formation was constructed within Jiang Yuantai’s sleeping chamber in order to heal his soul and lessen his pain. To strengthen the formation, Jiang Yuantai even tossed a bunch of precious herbs and holy water in, making it incredibly potent.

Even so, Jiang Yuantai was hardly in a good condition at all. His face was pale and his lips were dry. His closed eyes were quivering ever so slightly, indicating that he was going through great pain.

Jiang Kongping wasn’t surprised by the sight at all. He knew that Jiang Yuantai had consumed two forbidden pills in order to raise his fighting prowess during his fight with Chu Feng, so he was bound to suffer some backlash.

To be fair, the backlash he was going through was already considered light compared to the other forbidden medicine out there.

“Kongping, why did you plead for mercy on Chu Feng’s behalf?” Jiang Yuantai suddenly opened his eyes and asked Jiang Kongping.

His tone was calm but carried a hint of reproach.

“Big brother, if you look at things from Chu Feng’s perspective, he has done no wrong. He was willing to brave death for the sake of his friends. Cultivators like him are rare to come by. To be honest, I admire him greatly,” Jiang Kongping replied with a fearful smile.

He was afraid of his older brother.

“You’re admiring the enemy? How can you be this foolish?!” Jiang Yuantai bellowed furiously.

Jiang Kongping could only awkwardly smile back in response.

“Young master Yuantai, Sima Xiangtai seeks an audience!” a voice suddenly echoed from outside.

“Kongping, go and meet him,” Jiang Yuantai said.

He didn’t want Sima Xiangtu to see the state he was in. Knowing that, Jiang Kongping opened the door and headed out. However, he soon returned with a nervous look on his face.

“What’s wrong, Kongping?”

Sensing that something was amiss, Jiang Yuantai immediately shot to his feet.

“Big brother, I… I think I have made a huge mistake,” Jiang Kongping replied.

“Calm down, Kongping. Tell me what happened,” Jiang Yuantai said.

“It’s Chu Feng. Sima Xiangtu said that he had just entered his confinement formation earlier upon noticing a barrier there, but to his astonishment, Chu Feng wasn’t there. It seems like he has managed to escape from the confinement formation somehow,” Jiang Kongping reported honestly.

“Is that all? I was still wondering what could put you in such a fluster,” Jiang Yuantai replied with a cold sneer before sitting back down.

“Kongping, it’s just a mere Chu Feng. What are you so worried about?” Jiang Yuantai asked.

“Big brother, didn’t the prophecy say that Chu Feng would put a halt to our ambitions? Is there a chance that he might return to save the others?” Jiang Kongping asked worriedly.

“Hahaha!”

Jiang Yuantai burst into hearty laughter. He laughed for a very long while before finally replying, “Kongping, I concede that Chu Feng is indeed a prodigy, but he’s far too weak right now. If I had used my full strength, I could have easily crushed him as if I was crushing an ant. If he knows what’s better for him, he’d keep his distance. Otherwise, I’ll make him suffer a fate worse than death!”

Jiang Kongping was nervous only because he was afraid that Jiang Yuantai would berate him. After all, Jiang Yuantai would have killed Chu Feng off if not for him pleading for the latter’s mercy.

But since Jiang Yuantai thought nothing of it, his heart was put at ease. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jiang Kongping also thought that Chu Feng would be unable to do much due to the limitations of his cultivation. With Sima Xiangtu’s puppet army and the experts of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect gathered here, it was impossible for Chu Feng to turn the tables on them.

It was impossible for the prophecy to be realized.

Jiang Kongping gazed into the distance and murmured under his breath, “Don’t come back, Chu Feng.”

He earnestly admired Chu Feng and didn’t want the latter to die in his older brother’s hands.

…

Many days later…

Three people were gathered in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster Hall. They were the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, Hidden Dragon Chief Elder Duan Liufeng, and Chu Feng.

Zi Ling was still in closed-door training, so she was unaware of Chu Feng’s return. Fortunately, the person whom Chu Feng wanted to meet the most was still in the sect.

He had already told the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster about everything that had happened and was now waiting alongside Duan Liufeng for the sectmaster’s verdict. Her decision would determine the fate of his master, the Godwish Grandmother, and the many cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy.

“Are you done yet?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked with her back against Chu Feng.

“Lord Sectmaster, I don’t know what your current cultivation level is, but the Pill Dao Immortal Sect and Sima Xiangtu are indeed difficult enemies…”

Chu Feng was about to continue elaborating when the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster suddenly cut in.

“Who told you that I can’t deal with them?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked.

Chu Feng was delighted to hear those words. He didn’t know how powerful the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was, only that she was unfathomably strong. Unfortunately, those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect and Sima Xiangtu’s puppet army were formidable as well, such that he wasn’t sure whether the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster would be able to curb them.

Chu Feng was delighted to hear those words since it showed that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was confident of dealing with them. However, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster suddenly turned around and looked at him with chilling eyes that froze his smile.

“Chu Feng, have I been too lenient to you? As a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, you have neither focused on your cultivation nor made any contributions to the sect. Instead, you spent your time wandering all over the place. You should be glad that I haven’t removed your title as a Hidden Dragon Disciple! It’s one thing for you to get into trouble, but now you’re dreaming of bringing me in as well?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster bellowed.

She looked truly angered.

Chu Feng fell to his knees and pleaded, “Lord Sectmaster, I know that it’s inappropriate of me to ask you of such a request. It’s selfish motives at heart that I’m asking for this favor, but there’s really nothing else I can do to help anymore. I beseech you to help me. I’m willing to do anything for you in return, even if it means having to stay in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for the rest of my life!”

Chu Feng kowtowed deeply to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. It was rare for him to act so subserviently, but he had no other choice here. He wouldn’t want to pathetically beg another person in such a manner either, but with the safety of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and the others at stake, he had no choice but to do so.
