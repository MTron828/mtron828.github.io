Chapter 5315: Entering the Sacred Heavenly Temple Once More

Chapter 5315: Entering the Sacred Heavenly Temple Once More

The Ancient Realm’s chief didn’t leave right away after settling Chu Feng and the others. Instead, he gathered all of the tribe leaders and elders to the palace right next to the square.

“What are your thoughts on Chu Feng?” the Ancient Realm’s chief asked.

“Chu Feng’s cultivation is the weakest of the six remaining challengers, but his talent is incredible. I think that he’s comparable to Chu Xuanyan,” an elder said.

“Comparable to Chu Xuanyan? That’s an understatement. What he has achieved clearly surpassed Chu Xuanyan. He activated eighteen Ancestral Divine Monuments at once!” Elder Lai said.

“Elder Lai is right. I also think that Chu Feng’s talent is above that of Chu Xuanyan.”

Elder Lai’s words won the acknowledgment of the elders. Even the tribe leaders who harbored animosity toward Chu Feng for choosing the Yuan Lineage Tribe over them had to agree that his talent was superior to Chu Xuanyan’s.

“Elder Lai, what’s your evaluation of Chu Feng then?” the Ancient Realm’s chief asked.

“Lord Chief, Chu Feng’s talent is unrivaled. While his cultivation is currently the weakest of the six, that could be mainly attributed to his young age. I believe that it’s only a matter of time before he surpasses them. Furthermore, his cultivation is way higher than Chu Xuanyan’s back then. If the subsequent tests do turn out to be special too, I reckon that Chu Feng is the likeliest one to clear them,” Elder Lai said. 

The Ancient Realm’s chief nodded before turning to the others. “What are your takes?”

“Lord Chief, I won’t deny that Chu Feng’s talent is amazing, but that isn’t enough to overlook his lower cultivation. Talent represents future potential, but what matters in the present is his current cultivation level. On that aspect, I’m more favorable toward Miss Bai.”

The other elders also expressed their opinions. Some of them recommended Zhou Dong and Qin Shu too, though no one went with Jia Chengying and Bai Yunqing. 

The people of the Ancient Realm admired the strong, but Jia Chengying and Bai Yunqing had their faces slapped despite being the ones to provoke Chu Feng. This left them thinking that the two of them were unable to make it, thus resulting in their exclusion. 

“Lord Chief, what about you?” Elder Lai asked.

All of the elders and the tribe leaders turned to look at the chief. They understood that it was the chief’s view of the matter that mattered here. 

“Haa. I also think that Chu Feng is the most probable challenger, but he chose to go with the Yuan Lineage Tribe for whatever reason. He single-handedly obtained the acknowledgment of eighteen Ancestral Divine Monuments today. Just think about how great the benefits must have been for the Yuan Lineage Tribe. It’s fortunate that the Yuan Lineage Tribe has already fallen into decline, or else that would have been a pain in our back,” the Ancient Realm’s chief said.

“Indeed. Why did Chu Feng end up choosing the Yuan Lineage Tribe? Did he do it because he pities that little girl?”

“Speaking of which, I thought that the tribesmen of the Yuan Lineage Tribe have all lost their minds. Are they still able to bear offspring despite that?”

Some elders expressed their confusion. They hadn’t been paying any heed to the Yuan Lineage Tribe because they thought that it no longer posed any threat to them. That was also why they were surprised by the appearance of Little Crescent.

“That little girl is from the Yuan Lineage Tribe. She possesses exceptional talent; she even induced a phenomenon during her birth. I investigated the matter and found that her parents feigned insanity. That being said, none of them have been cultivating Little Crescent to exact vengeance on them. All the tribesmen want is to keep her safe,” Elder Lai said. 

“Elder Lai knew about this matter,” an elder asked.

“Yes. Lord Chief is aware of it too,” Elder Lai replied.

“Lord Chief also knows about it?”

The crowd was surprised. There was no one present who hated the Yuan Lineage Tribe more than their chief. The birth of an outstanding junior in the Yuan Lineage Tribe could potentially pose a threat to them, but their chief actually turned a blind eye to it?

“You should be aware that my original plan is to massacre the Yuan Lineage Tribe, but the Ancestral Idol issued a revelation instructing us not to do infighting. I had no choice but to condone them despite the threat they pose. I didn’t think that a little girl could cause any problems anyway, so I simply had Elder Lai keep an eye on her. Who could have thought that an accident would occur later on?” the Ancient Realm’s chief said.

“Accident? What accident?” The crowd was intrigued.

“We decided to turn a blind eye to the happenings of the Yuan Lineage Tribe, but Little Crescent’s parents still died shortly after her birth. They were poisoned,” Elder Lai said. 

“Poisoned… Did the people of the Yuan Lineage Tribe do it?” an elder asked. 

“Since it wasn’t our doing, the culprit is likely to be their own tribesman. This means that Little Crescent’s parents weren’t the only ones feigning insanity. In any case, their infighting has nothing to do with us. We figured that Little Crescent wouldn’t be able to last long without her parents, so we decided to leave things be. 

“But contrary to our expectations, it would appear that she survived. That’s why, both Lord Chief and I are wondering if the culprit had killed Little Crescent’s parents with the goal of raising her with his own hands,” Elder Lai said. 

“We’ll know the answer if we just interrogate Little Crescent,” a tribe leader proposed.

“There’s no rush. We’ll talk about this after the test,” the Ancient Realm’s chief said.

“Lord Chief, we cannot underestimate the severity of this matter. We mustn’t allow the Yuan Lineage Tribe any chance to make a comeback. They’re simply too cruel. They could…”

The elder’s voice suddenly trailed off as unease showed on his face. The others also looked unnerved as well. They still vividly remembered the battle with the Yuan Lineage Tribe. It was a huge relief that the Ancient Realm’s chief had led them to victory back then, or else they would have been the ones suffering right now. 

The more they thought about it, the more afraid they felt. 

“Lord Chief, let’s interrogate her as quickly as possible.”

They didn’t want to risk any complications.

However, the Ancient Realm’s chief shook his head and said, “I’d rather Miss Bai be the one who clears all the tests, but I still believe that young hero Chu Feng is the likeliest to emerge victorious. I’d prefer not to offend him before the dust settles. We’ll deal with the Yuan Lineage Tribe after he leaves.”

Since their chief had already made a stance, the other elders and tribe leaders had no choice but to respect his decision.

… 

Chu Feng was currently resting in his accommodations. 

Little Crescent had never enjoyed such luxurious accommodations before. She ran all around the place while stuffing tidbits and fruits into her mouth. It was not a huge place, but she still had fun in it as if it was a playground.

No matter how many difficulties she had been through, she was still a child. 

Chu Feng looked at Little Crescent and remarked, “It’s nice to be a child and live without worries.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It was the same for him back then too. While he was ostracized by the Chu Clan and was often bullied by others, he still had a fond memory of his childhood. On the one hand, Chu Yuan and Chu Guyu were often standing up for him. On the other hand, he was more easily satisfied back then. Life was much less stressful due to his innocent and simple mind, and happiness seemed much easier to reach.

“Eggy, why do you think my father gave up on the subsequent tests? He isn’t the type of person to give up in the face of adversity. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have taken the trouble to visit the Ancient Realm at all,” Chu Feng asked.

“He’s your father. How am I to know something that even you don’t know? Whatever it is, he must have his own considerations for making such a decision,” Eggy replied.

“But what could his considerations be?” Chu Feng fell into deep thought.

His father wasn’t the type to give up on such a precious opportunity. 

Tok tok tok!

Someone knocked on the door of the palace. It was the white-haired woman.

“Hey Miss Little Bai!” Chu Feng greeted with a smile, having already learned that the white-haired woman’s name was Little Bai.

“Call me Miss Bai instead,” the white-haired woman solemnly replied.

“All right. Miss Bai, please enter.”

Chu Feng invited the white-haired woman into the palace, but the latter didn’t enter. Instead, she passed a Cosmos Sack to him and said, “This is yours.”

She turned around and left right after. 

“She has spunk. I’m liking her more and more,” Eggy said with a smile before turning to the Cosmos Sack. “Quick, look inside the Cosmos Sack. Is it the Half-God level Sacred Temple Bead?”

Chu Feng closed the door before opening up the Cosmos Sack. Indeed, it was a locking bead and an opening bead. One had to place those two beads together in order to enter the Sacred Heavenly Temple. 

“She held her promise. I like that. Chu Feng, don’t hesitate and use it right away,” Eggy said.

“All right.”

Chu Feng first set up a formation to seal off the palace before covering himself in a concealment formation. Then, he struck the two beads together. 

A mysterious light enveloped the surface of his body, and his surroundings started to morph. Before he knew it, he was standing in the middle of a vast galaxy, surrounded by countless twinkling stars. It was such a breathtaking sight.  

Chu Feng clenched his fists in excitement, knowing that the Sacred Heavenly Temple was going to make an appearance once more.

A brilliant golden light suddenly emerged in the depths of space, commanding a divine atmosphere that induced deference. The blinding golden light gradually receded to reveal a humongous gate.

That was the gate contained inside the locking bead, and it was quickly floating in Chu Feng’s direction. It was both impressive and frightening. After all, the gate was larger than the combined landmass of the Nine Provinces Continent.

The humongous gate began to open, and Chu Feng was swept into it. The legendary Sacred Heavenly Temple finally appeared before his eyes. 

It was a building taller than the sky, made out of precious materials that were easily worth cities. Building such a humongous temple with intricate details must have taken a lot of effort and resources. Even after everything Chu Feng had been through, he was still awed by the Sacred Heavenly Temple.
