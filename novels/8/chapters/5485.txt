Chapter 5485: Failure?

“Those formation soldiers are summoned from the same formation, so they have the same openings. It’s easy to deal with them once you know their weaknesses,” Chu Feng said.

Long Fulai’s admiration deepened upon hearing those words. Compliments could be heard from the other Totem Dragon Clansmen too, though there were also exceptions like the bald man.

The bald man scoffed at Chu Feng and muttered, “Hoh! I was still thinking about how impressive you are. Turns out that you only figured out an opening to the formation!”

A nearby woman heard his mutter and questioned, “Is figuring out an opening not formidable? You should have done the same too if you think it’s that easy.”

“Y-you…”

The bald man stared at the woman with a look of disbelief.

He wouldn’t have been surprised if it was anyone else, but this woman was the one who threatened to massacre Chu Feng’s family members, to which, Chu Feng smashed her guts and made her collapse to her knees. That woman should have hated Chu Feng more than anything else in the world, but why was she speaking up for him now?

Many of the Totem Dragon Clansmen still saw Chu Feng as their enemy, but there were also quite a few people who had changed their opinion about him.

“Young hero Chu Feng, are you walking slowly because you’re observing the runes and the inscriptions on the walls? Is there something hidden in them?” Long Fulai asked.

He noticed that Chu Feng was paying close heed to the wall patterns around them.

“Have you been keeping an eye on the walls too?” Chu Feng asked.

“I have been looking, but I wasn’t able to figure anything out,” Long Fulai replied.

“I did notice something from the runes, but I’m hoping that I’ll never have to use it,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young hero Chu Feng is indeed formidable,” Long Fulai complimented.

He was a prodigy who had always towered above his peers, but he felt like he was nothing at all compared to a Chu Feng. He had never felt so helpless against a junior. It felt like the distance between them could never be bridged.

Their conversation informed others why Chu Feng had been traveling so slowly. No one complained about the slow walking speed anymore, though it considerably delayed them.

Soon, they arrived at a world filled with sand. The sand was imbued with a special element that impeded even the visibility of Half-God level cultivators. It was fortunate that the exits of the five corridors were located in proximity to one another.

There was a platform not too far away that had eight sculptures placed on top of it. These sculptures boasted a height of over ten thousand meters, making the crowd beneath them look no different than dust.

Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, Long Yuhong, and the others had already cleared their respective trials and were currently staring at the sculptures with tight frowns. Long Yuhong and her team had sustained significant injuries, such that there were even some who had fallen into a coma.

All of them kept looking at the fourth and the fifth corridors, but they were unable to peer into them due to the presence of a barrier.

Some time later, a group finally marched out of the fourth corridor. Standing at the forefront of the group was the grand elder’s grandson, Long Chenglu, but he and his men were injured.

Long Muxi glanced at the final passageway with a sliver of worry in her eyes. Meanwhile, Long Chengyu marched up to Long Chenglu with his men.

“Long Chenglu, where’s your big sister?” Long Chengyu asked.

“My apologies, young master Chengyu. I was inept,” Long Chenglu said.

“What happened?” Long Chengyu asked.

“We were presented with three options for our trial. The first option was to challenge a difficult formation. The second was to challenge an easy formation. The third was to simultaneously challenge the difficult and the easy formation. If we chose the third option, the difficult formation would be made easier, but the easy formation would be made harder.

“To be safe, my big sister and I went with the third option. I led half of the men into the easy formation, but the formation wasn’t easy at all. I nearly lost my life there. My big sister is unlikely to have cleared the trial; I think that they have all failed. Due to that, we weren’t able to receive any rewards. Young master Chengyu, I was inept,” Long Chenglu said in self-reproach.

“You need not blame yourself. It’s my fault,” Long Chengyu replied.

“Please don’t say that, young master Chengyu. How is it your fault? I was the one who was too weak to live up to Lord Clan Chief’s expectations,” Long Chenglu said.

“Young brother Chenglu, it really isn’t your fault. I made a wrong judgment. The five trials have different levels of difficulties, and I allocated the trials solely based on what our ancestors have been through instead of what we were presented with.” Long Chengyu lowered his head in shame.

“Young master Chengyu, do you mean that…” Long Chenglu suddenly realized something.

“The trial I entered was the easiest one, whereas the one Chu Feng and Long Zhizhi challenged was the hardest. Your trial was the second hardest. I got negligent and made a fatal error,” Long Chengyu said.

Those who were in Long Chenglu’s group widened their eyes in realization. They were still blaming themselves for being too weak and dragging down the others, but if the trial they had challenged was truly the second hardest, they couldn’t be blamed for struggling there.

“What’s the current situation? Is it still possible for us to obtain the God Taboo Martial Skill?” Long Chenglu asked.

“It’ll be hard. Even though I, my big sister, and Long Yuhong have cleared our respective trials, our rewards appear to be only of auxiliary use. The key lies with the rewards from Chu Feng’s trial, followed by your one,” Long Chengyu said.

“Doesn’t that mean that we have already failed?” Long Chenglu murmured in disappointment.

He could still remember the insane difficulty of the formation he had to overcome in order to come here, so how could Chu Feng’s group, which included the weakest members amongst them, possibly succeed in the trial?

The others also shared the same thought. They believed that they had already failed.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Weng!

Just then, the fifth barrier wavered, and silhouettes began walking out from within. It was Chu Feng’s group.

“Hm?”

The crowd was stunned. It should have been impossible for Chu Feng and his team to clear the trial. Even if they somehow succeeded, they should have suffered huge losses as a result. Yet, Chu Feng and his team were perfectly unharmed, with the exception of Long Zhizhi.

Logically speaking, it should have been impossible for Chu Feng and the others to clear their trial. Even if they succeeded, they should have suffered huge losses as a result. Yet, all of them looked as if they had returned from a holiday trip.

Could it be that they had made a misjudgment? Could it be that the trial Chu Feng’s group went through was actually the easiest instead of the hardest?
