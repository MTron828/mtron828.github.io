Chapter 2285 - Fire And Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation

“Huu, huu~~~”

The wind brought forth by the punch whistled like ferocious beasts, like an army of thousands of men and horses.

Kou Kang’s strength was no small matter. Although his attacks changed continuously, they also arrived instantly.

“Bang, bang, bang~~~”

Chu Feng’s body shifted. Immediately, his aura changed enormously.

His fists were like tigers and his legs were like dragons. They turned into countless blurs as he rushed forth to meet the incoming Kou Kang.

Not only did Chu Feng completely block all of Kou Kang’s attacks, he even began to unleash counterattacks at Kou Kang, suppressing his attacker.

“This guy.”

Seeing that Chu Feng had actually managed to easily block his attacks, and even began to unleash counter attacks at him, Kou Kang started to frown.

One should know that his punches and kicks were all very sharp.

Among the people of his same generation, the majority of them would only be able to produce such sharp attacks using martial skills. Practically none were capable of unleashing such sharp attacks without martial skills.

Thus, his skill with punches and kicks had always been his pride.

That was the reason why he had not used martial skills to begin with. He thought that if he was able to suppress Chu Feng using only his punches and kicks, he would be able to reveal how powerful he was.

However, at that moment, not only did Chu Feng’s punches and kicks not appear to be weaker than his own, they instead seemed to be stronger than his own. This completely shattered the scheme he’d had in mind.

“Amazing. Never would I have expected that little friend Chu Feng’s punches and kicks have reached this degree of mastery. They are simply unpredictable and unfathomable. If this were a world without martial skills, then merely with little friend Chu Feng’s mastery of his martial arts, it was likely that very few people of the same level of battle power as him would be able to contend against him.”

At that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master, Su Jingrui and the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster all revealed pleasantly surprised expressions.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s martial arts skills were truly proficient. Even they would not be able to reach Chu Feng’s level of mastery.

“Brother Chu Feng, a martial cultivator’s battle power is dependent on their usage of martial skills.”

“Although your ability with punches and kicks is pretty decent, it remains that what really matters to martial cultivators are their martial skills.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I will be using martial skills now. Prepare yourself, because what I will be using will be a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill.”

“However, you don’t have to worry too excessively either. Like my punches and kicks, I will only put forth half of my effort into my martial skills. As long as you prepare yourself, I will not be able to injure you,” Suddenly, Kou Kang moved back explosively and shouted at Chu Feng. After that, he began to unleash his martial skill.

“Pah! You clearly went all-out with your punches and kicks, yet you dare to say that you’ve only put forth half of the effort? You are truly shameless!” Xu Yiyi began to curse and mock Kou Kang.

“Haha, Brother Ouyang, although my disciple’s words might be a bit excessive, she was not speaking nonsense. This disciple of yours is truly someone who boasts a lot,” Su Jingrui looked to the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster with a smile.

When even Xu Yiyi was able to tell that Kou Kang’s earlier attacks with his punches and kicks were an all-out effort, how could the experts like Su Jingrui possibly not?

“Young people are always fond of winning. However, it is true that Kou Kang’s behavior isn’t good. I will criticize him about it afterwards,” The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster could only smile wryly. He was rather embarrassed.

The conversation between Su Jingrui and the others was heard by Kou Kang. Upon hearing his master’s embarrassed laughter, Kou Kang also felt slightly embarrassed.

Thus, he did not immediately unleash the Mortal Taboo Martial Skill that he had completed forming at Chu Feng. Instead, he deliberately removed half of its might before unleashing it at Chu Feng.

“Boom~~~~”

Once the fist strike was shot out, martial power started to surge. The surging martial power turned into a ferocious leopard. With its mouth wide open, the leopard rushed to devour Chu Feng.

Although Kou Kang had deliberately decreased the might of his martial skill by half, it remained that the martial skill he used was a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill. As such, it was still frighteningly powerful.

“Woosh~~~”

However, even though Chu Feng was faced with such a powerful attack, he didn’t dodge. Instead, he charged toward Kou Kang’s martial skill in a straight line.

Chu Feng’s speed was extremely fast. It was because he was not simply running. Instead, he was using a Mortal Taboo-level movement martial skill.

Thus, in merely a blink of an eye, Chu Feng had already arrived at the leopard formed with martial power.

“Bang~~~”

Chu Feng shot forth a punch and destroyed that leopard completely.

The Mortal Taboo Martial Skill Kou Kang had unleashed was like air; it did not give Chu Feng the slightest bit of resistance.

Thus, the might of Chu Feng’s punch did not decrease. Showing no quarter, it continued straight toward Kou Kang.

Furthermore, due to the fact that the punch was so fast, Kou Kang simply did not have the time to dodge at all. As such, he ended up being struck by Chu Feng’s punch.

“Boom~~~~”

Following a loud explosion, Kou Kang was knocked several meters back.

Even though Kou Kang had managed to block the might of Chu Feng’s punch during his moment of imminent peril, he was still knocked back several meters by that punch.

In fact, when he managed to steady himself, a trace of blood began to flow from the corner of his mouth.

“Great! Great ability!”

At that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master actually disregarded his status and started to applaud Chu Feng.

In fact, it was not only the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master who was so exceptionally excited. Even Su Jingrui and Kou Kang’s master had the same sort of pleasantly surprised expression.

Chu Feng’s punch was a very ordinary Mortal Taboo Martial Skill. It did not contain a lot of power. However, Chu Feng was able to unleash it with a power that surpassed that of the martial skill itself.

If it wasn’t for the fact that Chu Feng had managed to unleash that martial skill so perfectly, it would have been impossible for him to injure Kou Kang.

Chu Feng had already proven his battle power to be exceptional with his martial arts earlier. And now, after using his martial skills, he had demonstrated that he was extraordinary.

As matters stood, the three old men were all certain that Chu Feng was not only a genius in terms of world spirit techniques, his attainments in terms of martial cultivation were equally exceptional.

Chu Feng was truly an exceptional genius.

“Brother Kou Kang, I think that it would be best that you stop yielding to me. Else, I fear that I might end up injuring you because I am unable to control my strength,” Chu Feng said with a mocking smile.

“You!!!” Kou Kang was already extremely displeased when the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master started to applaud him being injured by Chu Feng in an undisguised manner. However, Chu Feng now actually said such a thing. This caused Kou Kang to feel even gloomier.

Most importantly, Kou Kang was actually unable to find a way to refute Chu Feng. After all, he was the one who had been boasting about not using his full strength earlier. Now, he could only suffer the consequences of his own actions.

However, Kou Kang was a rather shrewd individual. Even though he was burning with fury, he still ended up forcibly swallowing his fury that was about to explode.

With a smile on his face, Kou Kang said to Chu Feng, “Brother Chu Feng is truly extraordinary. I was careless earlier.”

“Since that is the case, I will no longer hold myself back. Merely, the attack that I will use will be extremely powerful. I hope that Brother Chu Feng will not take offense if I end up injuring you.”

Right after Kou Kang said those words, his long hair started to drift. He spread his arms wide open, and waves of boundless martial power began to emit from his palms.

At that moment...

A vortex of freezing cold appeared on Kou Kang’s left palm.

A vortex of blazing flames appeared on Kou Kang’s right palm.

Although the two vortexes were floating above Kou Kang’s palms, they both emitted an aura capable of causing destruction upon the world.

Those were two Emperor Taboo Martial Skills.

“That is?!”

Upon seeing that scene, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master and Su Jingrui immediately stood up emotionally.

Even the Three Stars Hall’s headmaster stood up abruptly. His expression changed enormously. Compared to the two old men from the Sunset Cloud Valley, he was even more emotional right now.

“Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation!!!”

“Kang’er, he, he actually successfully mastered the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragon Transformation?!!!”

The Three Stars Hall’s headmaster exclaimed loudly and emotionally.
