Chapter 3819 - Going To Meet Yuan Shu

In fact, it was not only the bystanders. Even the Seven Suns Mountain Range’s guardians looked at Chu Feng with curiosity in their eyes.

They all wanted to know if he was truly an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

Faced with the crowd’s curious gazes, Chu Feng decided to not conceal things. Thus, he spread open his palm, and his spirit power rose from his hand like a flame.

Seeing the flame, surprise filled the crowd’s eyes. Not even Lord White Gown was an exception.

Gasps could be heard from both in and outside the plaza.

The reason for that was because the flame on Chu Feng’s palm was flowing with Insect Mark Saint-level spirit power.

“Truly a heroic young man.”

“This old man is indeed incompetent. I actually wrongly accused young friend because of young friend’s exceptional talent. This old man’s crime is truly worthy of ten thousand deaths. Young friend, please punish me severely.”

As Lord White Gown spoke, he actually knelt before Chu Feng.

“Milord, you must not do that.”

Seeing that, the Seven Suns Mountain Range’s guardians immediately rushed to support Lord White Gown.

Faced with Lord White Gown acting like that, Chu Feng felt somewhat embarrassed.

At the very beginning, he had loathed that Lord White Gown.

After all, he had behaved extremely arrogantly earlier.

However, Chu Feng’s impression of him have had an enormous change. Although he had made an error in judgement earlier, he not only admitted fault after discovering that he was wrong, but he even took the initiative to punish himself.

Furthermore, even with his status, he did not hesitate to publicly kneel before Chu Feng. That was not something that ordinary people could do.

He was truly someone that dared to take responsibility for his actions, and acknowledge his mistakes.

“Senior, you don’t have to act this way. We can only say those cheaters were simply too sly," said Chu Feng.

“Young friend, it is because of this old man’s incompetence that you ended up suffering grievances. You cannot drop this matter like this.”

“Punish me. If you do that, I’ll be able to feel better.”

Lord White Gown had a slightly requesting tone as he said those words to Chu Feng.

“Senior, this junior wouldn’t dare to punish you. Merely, this junior has a request. I don’t know if senior might be able to help this junior with it,” said Chu Feng.

“What request do you have? Tell me," said Lord White Gown.

“This junior wishes to meet Lord Yuan Shu,” said Chu Feng.

“This...” Hearing those words, Lord White Gown revealed a difficult expression.

“Young friend, it’s not that we refuse for you to meet Lord Yuan Shu. It’s just that Lord Yuan Shu is in closed-door training, and no one will be able to meet him. Even we cannot meet him now,” said a guardian beside Lord White Gown.

“Young friend. I have wronged you greatly today. Although you are unwilling to punish this old man, I must still apologize for my offenses.”

After Lord White Gown finished saying those words, he invited Chu Feng away from the plaza and entered a palace deep in the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

That palace was not very large. It was made of spirit formations. It was square-shaped, and appeared very distinctive.

There were people standing guard outside the palace. However, not a single soul was present in the palace. Furthermore, even though many people had clearly followed them, only Chu Feng and Lord White Gown entered the palace.

The inside of the palace gave off a rather sacred feeling.

Chu Feng suspected that the palace must be a forbidden area of the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

After entering the palace, Lord White Gown first invited Chu Feng to take a seat. Then, he personally began to pour tea for him.

His behavior was completely unbefitting of a grand individual of the Seven Suns Mountain Range, instead more resembling that of a servant. He was entertaining Chu Feng very courteously.

“Senior, you don’t have to be this courteous.”

“Truth be told, this junior was indeed somewhat angry earlier. However, since the misunderstanding has been cleared up, everything is fine now. It was no big deal.”

Chu Feng felt slightly apologetic seeing Lord White Gown acting in such a manner.

Even if he was the one in the wrong, he was still a senior.

“Young friend, please have a cup of tea first.”

“Young friend, your name is Asura?”

Lord White Gown asked with a smile on his face.

“Mn, this junior is indeed named Asura." Chu Feng nodded.

Then, Lord White Gown asked Chu Feng about some things.

He was inquiring where Chu Feng had learned his world spirit techniques, and which power and which clan he belonged to.

Chu Feng only stated that he was not from the All-heaven Starfield, and did not answer anything else.

Lord White Gown was an intelligent person. He knew that Chu Feng did not want to reveal his identity. Thus, he did not continue with the questioning.

“Young friend Asura, I will speak frankly with you.”

“Lord Yuan Shu is actually not in closed-door training. He simply does not wish to meet others. As there are too few powerful world spiritists in the All-heaven Starfield, it made it so that all the various powers want to pay respects to Lord Yuan Shu. Whilst I say that they came to pay respects, they actually all came to request his assistance.”

“That said, if young friend Asura wishes to see Lord Yuan Shu, it is not impossible either.”

“In recent days, Lord Yuan Shu has just so happened to send out invitations to some outstanding younger generations of the All-heaven Starfield.”

“As long as they are able to pass a series of tests, they will be able to meet Lord Yuan Shu, who is in closed-door training at once.”

“Speaking of it, it is quite a coincidence. The day of the invitation was yesterday.”

“That said, the invitations were sent out from Lord Yuan Shu. Thus, only the people of the younger generation that were chosen by him were able to receive an invitation.”

“That said, since this old man has served Lord Yuan Shu for many years, I possess some face before him.”

“If young friend Asura wishes to see Lord Yuan Shu, I can make an exception and send you in. Of course... it will depend on your own ability as to whether or not you’ll be able to see Lord Yuan Shu or not. That said, since you’re already an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist at such a young age, those tests should be a walk in the park for you,” Lord White Gown said to Chu Feng.

“If that’s the case, I’ll have to trouble Lord White Gown," said Chu Feng.

“Alas. This old man has wrongly accused you. I feel extremely ashamed of myself. If I can help you with this trivial matter, this old man will feel much better.”

“That said, young friend Asura, you must not reveal that you were sent in by me should they ask you about it. You must say that you’ve received an invitation. Otherwise, I fear that the other people of the younger generation will be displeased," said Lord White Gown.

“This junior understands," said Chu Feng.

“Very well. Follow me. If we’re late, we might miss it.”

After making his decision, a talisman paper appeared on Lord White Gown’s hand.

Light started to circulate through the talisman paper. The symbols and runes on the talisman paper illuminated the entire palace hall. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Soon, a field of white covered Chu Feng’s vision.

After the white light disappeared, Chu Feng returned to the palace hall.

Merely, at that moment, it was no longer only him and Lord White Gown in the palace hall.

There were over twenty other people.

Without an exception, they were all people of the younger generation.

Those people of the younger generation were all dragons and phoenixes. They were far superior to the people of the younger generation that had entered the World Spirit Mansion Gate.

That said, amongst the crowd of dragons and phoenixes, there was one person who was particularly attention-grabbing.

It was a woman. She was very beautiful, like a celestial fairy that had descended to the world of mortals.

Even though the women present were all outstanding beauties, they would all lose their luster when compared to that woman.

Seeing that woman, even Chu Feng’s eyes shone, and his state of mind changed.

That said, the reason for Chu Feng’s reaction was not because of that woman’s appearance.

Instead, it was because the woman was someone he knew.
