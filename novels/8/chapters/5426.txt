Chapter 5426: Is This Our Gap?

“Big brother Chu Feng, what should I do?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Use your own method. You don’t have to support me,” Chu Feng replied.

“All right.” Bai Yunqing listened to Chu Feng and used his own method to perfect the formation.

Ling Hang also turned his attention back to channeling the formation too. Under their combined efforts, it didn’t take long for the formation to glow brightly.

“The formation has been perfected! Young friends, I don’t know how I can thank you.” Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle was over the moon.

“Hmph! It’s all thanks to young master Ling Hang,” Li Ta’er said.

“Big sister Ta’er, it’s obvious that big brother Chu Feng contributed the most to the formation,” Bai Yunqing said. It was his first time refuting Li Ta’er’s words ever since their first meeting, but he was doing it not for his own sake but Chu Feng's.

“What a joke! His formation is just for show. I don’t believe that a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist like him can really construct a formation comparable to a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist,” Li Ta’er said.

“Senior uncle, you should be able to tell who contributed the most to the formation.” Bai Yunqing turned to his senior uncle.

“I wasn’t paying attention, but the important thing is that the formation has been completed. The three of you have truly helped us greatly!” Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle said.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Chu Feng sneered in his heart. Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle had to know the truth, but he said those words to spare Ling Hang’s pride. It was out of respect for Bai Yunqing that he didn’t say anything about it.

“I think that it’s only fair for us to give young master Chu Feng a chance to prove himself. He mentioned that his formations are comparable to that of a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, so why don’t we use another method to prove his talents?” Ling Hang suggested.

“Does young master Ling wish to challenge us?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Challenge? It’s not as if we are enemies. I have another way to determine who of us three is the most talented one without resorting to a fight,” Ling Hang said as he took out a palm-sized copper palace.

The copper palace immediately drew everyone’s attention. Chu Feng could tell with a single glance that it was no ordinary item.

“What’s that, young master Ling Hang?” Li Ta’er asked.

“Miss Ta’er, this is a treasure from the Ancient Era that functions as a special cultivation ground. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion awarded it to my grandfather’s grandfather’s grandfather for a major contribution he has made to the clan, and it’s now passed down through my lineage as a family heirloom,” Ling Hang said.

“How do you cultivate with that?” Li Ta’er’s eyes glowed upon hearing the words ‘special cultivation ground’.

“All you have to do is to enter the copper palace,” Ling Hang replied.

“How do you determine who is the most talented one then?” Li Ta’er asked.

“There are three ways. The first way is by entering the palace. A key is required to access the palace, and there are two conditions to obtaining a key: being a junior and having a high level of intelligence. Without sufficient intelligence, one wouldn’t be able to enter the copper palace even with a key in possession.

“The second way is one’s ability to decipher formations. Those who enter the bronze palace will have to decipher its formations, or else they’ll be deemed unqualified and kicked out. The third way is to gain power. Based on the deciphered formations, the bronze palace will bestow a person power that aids in their cultivation.

“I took this bronze palace out with the intention to share it with the two brothers over here and Miss Ta’er,” Ling Hang said with a smile.

“Young master Ling Hang is too generous, unlike those two petty things,” Li Ta’er remarked.

“Is that woman ill in the head? Why is she insulting you for no reason?” Eggy berated.

“Pay her no heed, Eggy. I think that she really is ill,” Chu Feng said.

“She is? What is she ill with?” Eggy asked.

“She’s a compulsive bootlicker. Can’t you see how she keeps bootlicking on that Ling Hang?” Chu Feng said.

“Hah! That does seem to be the case.” Eggy burst into laughter.

Boom boom boom!

The hall began to pulsate as it formed a connection with the center formation that Chu Feng and the others had just perfected.

“The formation has been completed. All that’s left is the final compression. We should get out of here first,” Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle said.

Thus, he led the group toward a guest palace intended for receiving distinguished guests. Following that, he took his leave, claiming that he had affairs to attend to.

Chu Feng noticed that Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle was extremely interested in Ling Hang’s copper palace, but the latter still took his leave despite this. There was a good chance that this had something to do with the formation they had just perfected.

Someone must have been channeling the formation in the hall they were previously in for it to suddenly pulsate. The person who was channeling the formation must have been fairly powerful too, or else it wouldn’t have resulted in such a powerful might.

Chu Feng figured that the person behind the formation might be none other than Bai Yunqing’s master. It was possible that Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle was heading over to lend a helping hand.

“Miss Ta’er, brothers.”

Ling Hang took out three copper keys and handed the mover to Li Ta’er, Chu Feng, and Bai Yunqing. These copper keys were clearly made out of the same material as the bronze palace and were extremely small, spanning the length of a fingernail.

“The keys we have for our copper palace are finite; there aren’t many of them left after so many generations. My father has refused many juniors of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion the chance to enter the copper palace, and I have done the same too. It’s not that I’m heartless but I’m obliged to pass this family heirloom down to the next generation too,” Ling Hang said.

“Young master Ling Hang, why are you giving them such a precious opportunity? They aren’t worth it!” Li Ta’er said.

“It’s fine. I have a high opinion of young master Chu Feng and Brother Bai,” Ling Hang replied with a smile.

“Young master Ling Hang is truly a generous man. I’m just worried that your good intentions will go to waste,” Li Ta’er said.

“A bootlicker indeed,” Eggy scoffed.

“I, Ling Hang, believe in my eye for people. I’ll willingly accept it if my judgment was wrong,” Ling Hang said with great magnanimity.

He grasped the key in his hand tightly, and the copper palace quietly floated into the air. Many tiny runes surfaced around the copper palace and swiftly rotated around it.

Chu Feng curiously assessed the copper palace. He had to admit that while Ling Hang wasn’t anything good, his treasure was indeed formidable.

“What are those two fellows doing?” Eggy asked.

While Chu Feng’s attention was fixated on the swiftly rotating runes around the copper palace, he was still able to see Ling Hang and Li Ta’er in his peripheral vision.

“Ling Hang must be secretly offering guidance to Li Ta’er,” Chu Feng replied.

“Let’s meet inside,” Ling Hang said before proceeding to form a series of hand seals.

The copper key in his hand morphed into a bundle of spirit power that enveloped him. The next moment, he was transported into the copper palace with a flash of light.

Right after Ling Hang entered the copper palace, Li Ta’er looked at Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing and said, “With your skills, there’s no way the two of you can enter the copper palace even with those keys. It’s laughable how the two of you thought that you could steal young master Ling Hang’s merit. You’re just going to be humiliated!”

Li Ta’er formed a series of hand seals too, and she was transported into the palace just like Ling Hang.

“Big sister Ta’er was able to enter too?” Bai Yunqing was baffled.

“Your big sister Ta’er received Ling Hang’s guidance,” Chu Feng replied.

“I see. That explains it.” Bai Yunqing nodded in realization.

“Why are you so afraid of your big sister Ta’er?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s not that I’m afraid of her, but I’m indebted to my senior uncle. It wouldn’t be nice for me to get into a conflict with his daughter. After all, I would have already starved to death if not for my master and my senior uncle taking care of me,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Respect ought to go both ways.”

“I know that, big brother Chu Feng, but… Haaa. I’ll just treat it as returning my senior uncle’s favor.”

Chu Feng didn’t agree with Bai Yunqing’s decision, but it was not his place to interfere.

Bai Yunqing had already thought things through and came to a decision. Taking a step back, it was clear that Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle was clearly biased toward his daughter. If a conflict broke out between Bai Yunqing and Li Ta’er, the one to suffer was most likely Bai Yunqing.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I have figured out the method to use the copper key. I reckon that Ling Hang said those earlier words because he thought that we wouldn’t be able to see through the copper keys and enter the copper palace,” Bai Yunqing said gleefully.

“What’s the method you have figured out?” Chu Feng asked.

“The same one as Ling Hang.”

“That method isn’t right.”

“It isn’t right? But the two of them managed to enter the copper palace!” Bai Yunqing exclaimed.

“The copper key isn’t the crux to entering the copper palace,” Chu Feng explained.

“Is there another method to enter the copper palace?”

“Indeed. Let me teach you.”

Chu Feng proceeded to impart the method he had grasped to Bai Yunqing, but a frown quickly formed on the latter’s forehead.

“Big brother Chu Feng, your method is too complicated. I’m unable to carry it out,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Why don’t I teach you a special way to control your spirit power? You should be able to use my method if you are able to grasp it.”

Chu Feng proceeded to impart the world spiritist technique he had learned from Lord Qin Jiu. He knew that the full world spiritist technique was too complicated for Bai Yunqing to grasp on the spot, so he only taught the latter the relevant portions.

However, Bai Yunqing’s frown only deepened.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I don’t think I can learn your world spiritist technique. Just listening to it gives me goosebumps. I can’t even understand it, let alone putting it into practice,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Ah…” Chu Feng was rendered speechless. He didn’t think the part he had imparted to Bai Yunqing was that difficult, but it didn’t seem like Bai Yunqing was just procrastinating either.

“Big brother Chu Feng, is that the world spiritist technique you use to construct your formations?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Indeed,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I don’t think I can even feel envy for you anymore. You’re too incredible. It’s no wonder you’re so powerful.” Bai Yunqing shot Chu Feng a thumbs up. “Are you really not intending to use the copper key to enter the copper palace?”

“Let me demonstrate it for you.”

Chu Feng formed a series of hand seals that caused the copper key in his hand to tremble instead of shatter. Moments later, a ray of light shot out from the copper palace and enveloped him, dragging him in.

“Holy! Is this the gap between us?”

Bai Yunqing was stunned. He couldn’t believe that Chu Feng had entered the copper palace so easily. That was a method he couldn’t even think of executing, but Chu Feng was able to do it so easily!
