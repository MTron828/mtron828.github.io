Chapter 3641 - Despaired Crowd

“What are you all standing there for? Get moving.”

“Go down and take the first and second worlds back.”

Seeing that the seven people behind him were still standing there after he opened the Reversal Gates, Nangong Yifan spoke with annoyance.

“Eh... Yifan, you want all of us to go down?” One of the seven asked.

The reason why he asked that was naturally because he was worried about Nangong Yifan.

Even though Nangong Yifan was very powerful, they did not know exactly how powerful he was.

Thus, they were still worried about him taking on Chu Feng and the other twelve.

“All of you can go down. I myself am sufficient here,” said Nangong Yifan.

“This...”

The crowd’s heart tensed up upon hearing those words. This was especially true for the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Arrogance. What sort of arrogance was this?

Even though he clearly knew that Chu Feng had gained mastery over the chess strategy ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand’, and Kong Ci and the others were all clad in many treasures, Nagong Yifan still dared to utter those words.

If this was not arrogance, what could it be?

This was a sign of absolute arrogance. Nangong Yifan was so arrogant that he still did not put Chu Feng and the others in his eyes even after Chu Feng had displayed his strength.

However, no one was able to criticize him for his arrogance. After all, they all knew that had possessed the means to act arrogantly.

Up until that moment, no one knew exactly how powerful Nangong Yifan was in the chess formation.

“Very well. Yifan, be careful.”

Seeing how confident Nangong Yifan was, the seven younger generations from the All-heaven Starfield stopped hesitating, and all leaped into the Reversal Gate.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Seven figures flew up at the same time.

“Taa~~~”

“Taa~~~”

“Taa~~~”

......

However, when the seven of them landed, astonishment filled their faces.

They were not the only ones who were astonished. Kong Ci and the others were also astonished.

Suddenly, Nangong Yifan also turned around. When he saw the scene behind him, even he started frowning with a surprised look in his eyes.

It turned out that after the seven people from the All-heaven Starfield landed, they were still in the third world.

They were standing where the Reversal Gate was previously.

Merely, the Reversal Gate had disappeared.

The Reversal Gate had been closed.

“Yifan, what are you doing?”

One of the seven All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations looked to Nangong Yifan.

He was not the only one. The others also looked to Nangong Yifan. They all felt that it was Nangong Yifan who had closed the Reversal Gate.

“It’s not me,” said Nangong Yifan.

“Not you?”

The crowd were all confused upon hearing those words. If it wasn’t Nangong Yifan, who could possibly close the Reversal Gate?

“It’s you?”

Suddenly, Nangong Yifan and the seven all turned their gazes to Chu Feng.

Seeing that, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s twelve also turned their gazes to Chu Feng.

Faced with the questioning gazes of the crowd, Chu Feng did not answer them directly. Instead, he said, “I’ve said that this place is our Ancestral Martial Starfield’s territory now.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Since this is the territory of our Ancestral Martial Starfield, how could you, people from the All-heaven Starfield, be allowed to come and go as you please?”

“Heavens! It really was Chu Feng!”

“Amazing! Never would I have imagined that he is actually also capable of controlling the Reversal Gates.”

At that moment, the crowd had confirmed that it was indeed Chu Feng who had closed the Reversal Gates.

Because of that, they suddenly felt anticipation toward his strength.

After all, compared to opening Reversal Gates, forcibly closing the Reversal Gates opened by another was definitely even more difficult to accomplish.

After confirming that it was indeed done by Chu Feng, Nangong Yifan’s expression turned ugly.

He felt humiliated to have had his Reversal Gates closed by Chu Feng without detecting it at all.

Never before had he suffered such humiliation in the chess formation.

Suddenly, Nangong Yifan shouted, “Chu Feng, I’ve underestimated you. However, did you really think that you’d be able to defeat me with just that?!”

Then, boundless chess power rushed out from his body.

His chess power swept forth like a whirlwind. It was so powerful that dust was raised all over, the creatures and plants were destroyed, and even Kong Ci and the others clad in chess power treasures were blown away.

Like fallen leaves, they could only allow the whirlwind to carry them far away.

“This... how powerful of a chess power is this?”

Seeing that, even Lord Shoujian revealed a look of shock.

The chess power Nangong Yifan had unleashed was truly terrifying. It could even be said that his chess power was capable of easily destroying the third world, turning it into a hell on earth.

“Damn it! Is that guy even human?”

“Monster. He is most definitely a monster.”

“After all this, it turns out our opponent is actually such a monster? How exactly are we supposed to compete in chess with this? Might as well cancel the Ancient Era’s Cultivation Chess matches. He’s simply on a completely different level. The chess matches no longer hold any meaning.”

At that moment, Kong Ci and the others were blown to the edge of the third world. If it wasn’t for the barrier surrounding the third world, they would’ve most likely been blown out of the third world.

Fortunately, as they were all clad in treasures, they were not seriously injured.

However, facing such overwhelming power, they felt both furious and desperate.

They were furious at how powerless they were, and being toyed with by Nangong Yifan.

As for their despair, it came from how overwhelmingly powerful Nangong Yifan was. Likely, no matter how hard they worked, they would not be able to contend against him.

That was the reason why they thought about canceling the chess matches.

“Too terrifying. That is simply too terrifying.”

Not to mention the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations, even the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were unable to keep themselves from exclaiming in fear.

Even they were terrified by Nangong Yifan’s chess power.

“Huuu~~~”

To the crowd’s surprise, another overwhelming chess power emerged in the third world. This chess power seemed to be even stronger than Nangong Yifan’s chess power, as it actually managed to turn the situation around, and forcibly cancel out Nangong Yifan’s chess power that was wreaking havoc throughout the third world.

“Chu Feng! It’s Chu Feng!!!”

At that moment, the crowd were able to see that the overwhelming chess power that had appeared all of a sudden came from Chu Feng’s body.

It was Chu Feng who had dispelled Nangong Yifan’s chess power.

“You... how can you possess such chess power?”

Not to mention the others, even the insufferably arrogant Nangong Yifan had a huge change in his expression.

He has been filled with confidence the entire time, and did not place anyone in his eyes.

However, a change had occurred on his face. A trace of panic was present in his eyes.
