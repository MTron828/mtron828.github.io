Chapter 4156 - Humiliation

At that moment, Chu Feng and the old man were both frowning.

The reason for that was because neither of them had noticed anybody’s aura before the voice was heard.

Both the aura and the voice had appeared out of nowhere.

This meant that the two people that had suddenly appeared were extremely powerful. Else, they couldn’t have concealed themselves from Chu Feng and the old man.

Sure enough, as Chu Feng looked to the direction where the voice sounded from, he saw the space there distorting and two figures appearing from the distortion.

They were a young man and a white-haired old man.

Although the man looked like a young man, Chu Feng could tell that he was not a person of the younger generation.

He was at least over a thousand years old.

At the instant he revealed himself, his cultivation was also revealed.

Rank one Utmost Exalted.

Although he was over a thousand years old, he would not be considered very old amongst martial cultivators.

To be able to possess a rank one Utmost Exalted-level cultivation at such an age, he could also be considered a genius.

However, that was not a cultivation capable of concealing him so thoroughly from Chu Feng.

The reason why Chu Feng hadn’t been able to detect them was because of the old man that stood behind the young man.

That old man also did not conceal his aura. His cultivation was that of a rank six Utmost Exalted.

He was an expert with the same cultivation as Long Daozhi.

Chu Feng also noticed that the old man and that young man both had identical title plates hanging at their waists.

Nine Principles Dragon Sect.

Both the old man and the young man were gazing at Chu Feng.

Their aloof and arrogant gazes contained a trace of ridicule.

They seemed to be saying with their eyes that they were destined to step on him.

However, Chu Feng was not afraid. He asked, “Earlier, you said that this item does not belong to us?”

“Of course. A treasure like that shall be the possession of he who is capable. Trash like you three are simply not qualified to possess it,” said the young man.

“Therefore, you want to rob us?” asked Chu Feng.

“Rob?”

“I don’t plan to rob you. I want you to personally deliver it to me,” said the young man.

“And what if I refuse?” asked Chu Feng.

“Brat, did you not see the title plate on my waist?”

“Or could it be that you do not know who I am?”

The young man still had a ridiculing smile on his face. However, this smile now contained ill intent.

“Benefactor, you should hand them that Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone.”

“That young man is the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster. As for the Nine Principles Dragon Sect, they are one of the most powerful powers among the numerous powers that have been abandoned by the Dragon Clan. Their Sect Master’s cultivation has even reached rank seven Utmost Exalted. Reportedly, he’s only a fine line away from becoming a rank eight Utmost Exalted.”

“Standing behind that Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster is their Supreme Elder. That man is known to be vicious and merciless.”

“We cannot afford to offend the two of them.”

Right at that moment, a voice had entered Chu Feng’s ears. The person who’d spoken was the youth’s grandfather.

Even though the youth’s grandfather spoke through voice transmission, Chu Feng could still sense his fear towards the Nine Principles Dragon Sect in the tone of his voice.

Chu Feng took a glance at the confident Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster.

Then, he took a glance at the Supreme Elder eyeing him covetously whilst standing behind that young sectmaster.

Hesitation appeared in Chu Feng’s fearless eyes.

Whilst Chu Feng was hesitating, neither the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster or that Supreme Elder said anything.

They were quietly gazing at him.

However, their gazes were extremely vicious. They were like hawks circling their prey.

They were waiting for Chu Feng’s decision. If he decided to agree they might be willing to spare him.

However, if he was to be stubborn and still insist on refusing, they would show him no quarter.

Finally, Chu Feng chose to come to terms with them.

Although he was very unwilling, he raised his arm and tossed the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone to the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster.

After the young sectmaster caught the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone, the ridiculing smile on his face turned into a smile of victory. The gaze that he looked to Chu Feng with was filled with even more contempt.

“And here I thought you were someone with balls.”

“Never would I have expected you to be in this too.”

“In the end, trash will always be trash.”

After ridiculing Chu Feng, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster handed the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone to the Supreme Elder behind him.

“Senior, how is it?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It turned out that the Supreme Elder was also a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

“It’s genuine. It is indeed a Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone,” said the Supreme Elder after examining the stone.

Hearing those words, the smile on the young sectmaster’s face grew even more intense.

“Three trash. You’re lucky that you know your standing. Today, this young sectmaster is happy. As such, I will spare your lives.”

After saying those words, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster turned around and began to leave.

The Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s Supreme Elder also followed after him.

With that, only the old man, the youth and Chu Feng remained.

“Grandpa.”

Suddenly, he burst into tears.

He was weeping bitterly. It could even be said that he was in so much grief that he wished he was dead. He was on the verge of crumbling.

After all, he had wanted to use the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone to treat his father’s illness.

That hope had now been shattered. It was only natural for him to feel deep pain and regret.

“A man must not shed tears easily,” as Chu Feng spoke, he walked over to the youth and comforted him. “Actually, you two still have a chance.”

“Chance?”

Although the youth was still sobbing spasmodically, he looked to Chu Feng with tear-filled eyes upon hearing those words.

A longing expression was present in his eyes.

“Benefactor, they’re the Nine Principles Dragon Sect. Since the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone has landed in their hands, it would be very difficult for us to retrieve it.”

“Benefactor, you should give up on it too,” said the old man.

However, Chu Feng shook his head. He said, “The two of you came here with the goal of obtaining that Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone.”

“But, the goal of the other people is not that Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone.”

“As long as you are to find Dragon Vein Source Stone, there will naturally be people willing to exchange a Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone for it.”

“This old man understands what benefactor is saying. It’s just that finding a Dragon Vein Source Stone is extremely difficult,” said the old man.

“If we are to cooperate, we might be able to find it.”

“If you believe me, then accompany me,” said Chu Feng.

“Of course we believe you. Thank you benefactor,” the old man and the youth immediately expressed their thanks upon hearing those words.

They’d already witnessed how powerful Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were earlier.

If he were willing to help them, they felt that they might really have a chance to obtain a Dragon Vein Source Stone.

“Benefactor, I am truly sorry. If it wasn’t for this old man saying too many superfluous words, you wouldn’t have been insulted like that,” the old man said with an apologetic expression.

The reason why he was blaming himself was because he felt that if he hadn’t stopped to tell Chu Feng about the misfortunes his clan had encountered, Chu Feng might’ve already left.

If he had left sooner, he wouldn’t have encountered those two people from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect, and wouldn’t have had his Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone robbed by them.

“It’s alright. A man can submit or stand tall as required. In this martial cultivation world, unless one is the strongest, who would dare say that they’ve never been humiliated before?” laughed Chu Feng.

Although that was what Chu Feng said, he still turned around before setting off and looked in the direction that the Nine Principles Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster had left in.

No one noticed that when Chu Feng glanced in that direction, a pleased smile appeared on his face.
