Chapter 3626 - Strange Young Woman, Yin Zhuanghong

“She’s coming, she’s coming.”

“It’s actually a woman?”

“Good gracious! She’s so beautiful!”

“She’s simply too beautiful. How could there be such a beautiful woman in this world?”

“It’s no wonder Nangong Yifan would ask us to wait for her.”

Not long afterward, the crowd burst into an uproar. Chu Feng knew that the person Nangong Yifan was waiting for must’ve arrived.

However, as Chu Feng was extremely focused on studying the chess strategy and had no interest in Nangong Yifan’s friend, he did not even bother to raise his head to look.

However, Kong Tianhui suddenly grabbed Chu Feng’s arm. Although he was a grown man, he was jumping up and down excitedly like a little girl.

“Brother Chu Feng, look, look! Look who that is! Quickly, look!”

Faced with such a Kong Tianhui, Chu Feng helplessly raised his head to look.

Once he did that, Chu Feng was also stunned. A shocked expression appeared in his eyes.

What came into view was a woman wearing a red dress, with a head of long black hair.

Her appearance was truly devastatingly beautiful. One could describe her as an exceptional beauty.

At the moment she appeared, all the women present were overshadowed by her. Even beauties of Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun’s caliber were dimmed greatly by her.

As for that woman, she was none other than the strange woman that Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui had encountered whilst capturing the Natural Oddity.

“So that girl is actually from the All-heaven Starfield?” Chu Feng mumbled to himself.

“Her aura, that’s strange.”

Soon, Chu Feng discovered that the woman’s aura was strange.

That day, the woman had concealed her aura completely. Chu Feng was simply unable to detect her aura at all. However, he knew that she was very powerful, extremely powerful.

However, the aura that the woman currently emitted was inconsistent with what Chu Feng had expected.

The woman was currently emitting the aura of a rank two Exalted. Even though this aura was very powerful, and was the cultivation that the strongest of the younger generations present possessed, Chu Feng knew that it was most definitely not the true strength that that woman possessed.

At the very least, the strength that she had revealed that day was absolutely superior to that of a rank two Exalted. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Brother Yifan, you are truly amazing. It’s no wonder you’re willing to ask Lord Shoujian to wait. Turns out, you actually managed to get Yin Zhuanghong to come.”

Compared to the astonishment of the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield at that woman’s appearance and cultivation, the people from the All-heaven Starfield were even more excited.

“Yin Zhuanghong. So she’s Yin Zhuanghong.”

“So she’s the renowned Yin Zhuanghong.”

After hearing the comments and the name of the woman from the people from the All-heaven Starfield, many people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield actually grew excited too.

“No wonder she’s so cold. So she is Yin Zhuanghong. Hahaha.”

In terms of excitement, Kong Tianhui was particularly excited.

“Who is this Yin Zhuanghong?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

Whilst Chu Feng might not be interested in other people, he was quite curious about that woman.

“Hehe. Brother Chu Feng, in terms of the beauties of our Ancestral Martial Starfield, little sister Xian Yun, little sister Long Ning and, reluctantly, my younger sister could all be considered to be beauties,” said Kong Tianhui.

“What do you mean by ‘reluctantly?’ Are you my actual older brother?” Kong Ci was standing nearby. She rolled her eyes Kong Tianhui.

However, Kong TIanhui simply ignored her. He continued to speak to Chu Feng, “However, there is an extremely famous and super major beauty in the All-heaven Starfield. She is publicly accepted to be the number one beauty in the All-heaven Starfield. She is Yin Zhuanghong.”

“Her reputation is truly well-justified. In the past, I had thought that little sister Xian Yun and little sister Long Ning were extremely attractive. However, after seeing this Yin Zhuanghong, they’ve lost their luster by comparison,” Kong Tianhui sighed.

“How is she that beautiful? The way I see it, she’s not even as beautiful as me,” Kong Ci said.

“She’s much more beautiful than you in every aspect, okay? You’re unable to even compare to little sisters Long Ning and Xian Yun, how could you compare to this super beauty?” Kong Tianhui refuted.

“You are definitely not my biological older brother,” this time around, Kong Ci stared fiercely at Kong Tianhui.

Whilst the crowd were chatting, that Yin Zhuanghong approached them.

Nangong Yifan immediately stepped forward with a smile on his face.

Not only was he smiling, but he also had an eagerly attentive look on his face.

“If I didn’t see it myself, I would’ve thought that Nangong Yifan was someone incapable of smiling.”

Seeing such a thing, many people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield began to make quiet comments. Their tones were filled with mockery.

“Hey! Big beauty Yin Zhuanghong, do you still remember me?”

At the moment when the crowd were quietly mocking Nangong Yifan, someone suddenly called out to Yin Zhuanghong from the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s crowd.

It was Kong Tianhui. Dead shameless, he would naturally not let the opportunity to put himself in the limelight slip by.

After he spoke, many people from the All-heaven Starfield and Ancestral Martial Starfield looked at him. Even Nangong Yifan looked over at him. However, Yin Zhuanghong did not bother to even take a glance at him.

Seeing that Yin Zhuanghong was ignoring him, Kong Tianhui continued. “Don’t you recognize me? We’ve met before. Have you forgotten about me pushing you away and saving your life when that giant fish tried to eat you, leading to me being eaten by it instead?”

“What nonsense are you spouting? Eaten by a giant fish?”

“Furthermore, big beauty? Can you stop being a disgrace? How could I have an older brother like you?” Kong Ci looked to Kong Tianhui with contempt.

However, Kong Tianhui simply ignored his younger sister. He was completely focused on calling out to Yin Zhuanghong.

However, no matter what sort of method Kong Tianhui used, Yin Zhuanghong still never took a glance at him.

She also did not look at Chu Feng.

She acted like she had never seen them before.

Although Nangong Yifan was cold, he at least became very cordial and enthusiastic upon seeing Yin Zhuanghong. However, that Yin Zhuanghong, even when the person speaking to her was Nangong Yifan, did not show the slightest bit of a smile on her face. In fact, she only nodded at Nangong Yifan, and did not even say a word to him.

That Yin Zhuanghong was truly an ice beauty.

“Since everyone is gathered, this old man will bring young friends to the Divine Armament Cemetery.”

Soon afterward, Lord Shoujian lead Chu Feng and the others to the so-called Divine Armament Cemetery.

The Divine Armament Cemetery was exactly like its name.

One would have to go underground, enter through a cemetery, and continue deeper underground the entire time.

Even though the construction of the path was very refined, it was still very eerie, and truly gave off the feeling of being in a cemetery.

That said, it must be mentioned that countless black weapons had appeared in the crowd’s vision after they entered the Divine Armament Cemetery. Those weapons were present on the ground, on the wall, stuck into buildings, and even on top of palaces. The black weapons were simply all over the place.

However, no one extended their hands to touch those weapons. The reason for that was because they all knew that they could only take a single weapon. After taking a single weapon, they would be sent out by the power of that place, and would not be able to return.

According to the crowd’s experience, the deeper they went, the better the weapons would be.

Thus, the crowd were all prepared to go deep into the Divine Armament Cemetery first before picking their weapons.

However, as Chu Feng continued to walk, he suddenly discovered a spirit formation gate appearing in thin air in an unremarkable corner.

Most importantly, the color of the spirit formation gate was changing nonstop.

This caught Chu Feng’s attention.

“Brother Chu Feng, you must not enter that gate. The weapons in there are all crap.”

“Let us proceed. Let me tell you, the further we go, the better the weapons are,” seeing that Chu Feng was focused on that spirit formation gate, Kong Tianhui immediately walked up to him and urged him against entering.

“Wait,” however, Chu Feng gestured with his hand for Kong Tianhui to wait. His gaze was still fixed on that spirit formation gate.
