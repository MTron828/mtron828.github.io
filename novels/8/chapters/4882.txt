Chapter 4882: Embrace

“Could it just be a scare? Let me give it a try.”

Shengguang Haoxuan began executing his martial skill, intending to try out the waterfall of light blocking their path. No one tried to stop him as this was the only move they could make now.

However, just as Shengguang Haoxuan was about to make a move, Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.

“I advise you not to approach that waterfall or attack it. Otherwise, the power inside the waterfall will gush out and kill you.”

Everyone immediately turned to look at Chu Feng, only to see that he was emanating a faint glow. It resembled the ray of light that was shining on him earlier, and even the aura felt identical too. It seemed to be a remnant left behind from back then.

It made him blend in with the glowing surroundings, as if he was native to this land and not a mere outsider. It felt like there was something very different about him.

“Brother Chu Feng, what’s with the light around you?” Shengguang Chuyao asked.

“What light? Ah, I wouldn’t have noticed it if you haven’t told me.”

Chu Feng was confused at the start, but he widened his eyes in realization upon looking at himself.

“This should be the remnant of the light that shrouded us before we entered this place. I was still wondering why there were some clues regarding the Holy Lotus Tree in my head as soon as I stepped in here. I reckon that it was the ray of light providing me a hint.

“That would explain why the final ray of light only shone on me. I thought that it was a formality, but it seems like there’s more to it,” Chu Feng murmured under his breath.

“Brother Chu Feng, you know something about this place? What should we do then?”

Shengguang Chuyao was delighted to hear that Chu Feng had a clue about this place.

“I can’t say that I know the path, but I do know what we have to do right now. That waterfall of light is a formation that we need to decipher, but we can’t just recklessly approach or attack it. Based on the hint I received, I think I have to be the one to do it,” Chu Feng said.

“What a joke. The most outstanding juniors of the Holy Valley are gathered here, so what makes you think that you are qualified to be the one deciphering the formation? Besides, why should we listen to you? Who do you think you are?”

Shengguang Haoxuan looked at Chu Feng in disdain.

He had long wanted to teach Chu Feng a lesson, but he wasn’t able to find an opportunity to do so. Now that Chu Feng had started boasting in front of them, he decided to make use of this opportunity to deal with him.

“It’s just a friendly reminder. If you don’t believe me, you’re free to give it a try. You wanted to use martial power to break the barrier, right? Go on then. Just don’t blame me if you lose your life,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll do what I like; you need not tell me what to do. You’re nothing more than a countryside bumpkin!”

Shengguang Haoxuan was clearly afraid of recklessly making a move either. As much as he didn’t want to follow Chu Feng’s bidding, he wasn’t willing to risk his life for it. He even dissipated the force he had just gathered in his hands.

It was clear that he was a person who feared death.

To hide his own fear, he began to frenziedly insult Chu Feng.

Chu Feng wasn’t angered by Shengguang Haoxuan’s attitude, but he wouldn’t simply sit still as someone insulted him. Just as he was about to retaliate, another voice sounded. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Shengguang Haoxuan, shut your mouth. How can you be so impolite? Don’t you know that Chu Feng is a guest of our Holy Valley?”

Surprisingly, the person who berated Shengguang Haoxuan was Shengguang Menglai.

“Menglai, I...”

Shengguang Haoxuan appeared to be really intimidated by Shengguang Menglai, though he was displeased to hear the latter speaking up for Chu Feng.

Of course, he wouldn’t dare to display his displeasure to Shengguang Menglai. He chose to vent his emotions on Chu Feng instead.

“This young miss sure is well-mannered. The rest of you could learn a thing or two from her.”

Chu Feng could tell that Shengguang Haoxuan bore feelings for Shengguang Menglai, so he intentionally walked toward the latter.

“This lady here, you are Shengguang Menglai, right? I am Chu Feng. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

“Young master Chu Feng, it’ll suffice for you to call me Menglai. Our Holy Valley has been in seclusion for a long time now, so we don’t get a lot of chances to interact with outsiders. Pardon us if there’s any lapse in our etiquette,” Shengguang Menglai replied.

Shengguang Menglai’s attitude was courteous but distant.

Nevertheless, Shengguang Haoxuan was still infuriated to see the reticent Shengguang Menglai chatting with Chu Feng. His eyes nearly popped from their sockets out of fury.

“It’s fine. I’m not in the habit of arguing with uncultured individuals. Young miss Menglai, you seem to be emanating a fragrant scent. Is this what they call body scent?”

Chu Feng glanced at the infuriated Shengugang Haoxuan as he took yet another step closer to Shengguang Menglai.

Shengguang Menglai’s face stiffened at his remark, but she was able to quickly put her emotions under control.

“Young master Chu Feng, you mentioned earlier that you need to be the one to decipher the formation. Are you certain about it? If you have received a hint, I think it’s worth giving it a try. Otherwise, it’d be best for us to discuss a course of action together. It’d be unwise for us to make reckless moves.

“Our goal here is to train, so I hope that we can all walk out of this place safely,” Shengguang Menglai said.

“Young miss Menglai, the hint I received told me that the waterfall of light is an extremely dangerous formation, and I need to decipher the formation alone. I think that I should give it a try.”

Chu Feng shrugged calmly. His movements highlighted his glowing body.

“We’ll be troubling you then, young master Chu Feng,” Shengguang Menglai said.

“Speaking of which, young miss Menglai... I have a request I would like to ask of you,” Chu Feng suddenly said.

“Feel free to speak, young master Chu Feng,” Shengguang Menglai replied.

“There’s some danger involved in deciphering the formation, but I have no choice to go because of the hint. I have never been embraced by a lady as beautiful as you. I think that I’ll die in regret if I miss this opportunity, so...”

Chu Feng looked at Shengguang Menglai shyly.

“...”

A frown formed on Shengguang Menglai’s face, and she turned her eyes away to avert Chu Feng’s gaze.

At the same time, displeased faces were directed toward Chu Feng.

These displeased looks made it clear that it was not just Shengguang Haoxuan amongst the crowd who viewed Shengguang Menglai as his goddess.

“Chu Feng, are you courting death? How dare you try to take advantage of Menglai! Do you know who she is?” Shengguang Haoxuan bellowed.

It was clear that Chu Feng was trying to take advantage of Shengguang Menglai here.

Chu Feng was definitely not a lustful person, and he didn’t harbor perverted thoughts toward Shengguang Menglai. He just wanted to taunt Shengguang Haoxuan a little, and the best way to do so was to tackle his weak spot.

Under normal circumstances, Chu Feng’s request wasn’t really overboard either. It was just a hug, and most people would accept it in view of the situation.

However, upon seeing Shengguang Menglai’s expression, Chu Feng knew right away that she had a special background. The reactions of the crowd also told him that it was unlikely that he would be able to accomplish his plan.

Shoosh!

A soft fragrant body suddenly fell into his embrace. A beautiful lady had walked into Chu Feng’s arms.

But this person wasn’t Shengguang Menglai but the other beauty present.

Shengguang Xintian.
