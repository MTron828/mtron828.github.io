Chapter 5450: Miss Bai’s Identity

It was a man and a woman.

The woman had fair skin and long snowy hair. Her features paired with her white dress made her look like a snow spirit. Despite her beautiful appearance, her eyes were frigid.

Chu Feng recognized her. She was the strongest early Half-God level cultivator, though she chose to relinquish her Strongest Token in the end.

The man beside Miss Bai was a licentious fatty with a big head and large ears. A noose was tied around his neck, and the one holding the leash to the noose was none other than Miss Bai.

From the crowd’s discussions, Chu Feng learned that the fatty was Jia Lingyi’s son, Jia Huo.

The truth was finally out. The one who had impersonated Chu Feng to kidnap Jia Huo turned out to be Miss Bai!

Boom!

Jia Lingyi released a huge flood of spirit power and sealed off the surroundings, but she didn’t make a move on Miss Bai right away. She could tell that the noose around Jia Huo’s neck was not just any ordinary noose. Making a reckless move now could cost her son’s life.

“You’re the lady Chengying spoke about?” Jia Lingyi assessed Miss Bai.

“You know me?” Miss Bai asked.

“I do. You defeated Jia Chengying in the Trial of the Strongest, and the two of you met again in the Ancient Realm. Young miss, you have the looks and the talent, but your mind isn’t too sharp. Do you know what it means to side with Chu Feng against our Pill Dao Immortal Sect?” Jia Lingyi asked coldly.

“Your Pill Dao Immortal Sect?” Miss Bai scoffed, clearly showing that she didn’t think highly of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. “I am indeed acquainted with Chu Feng, but I should clarify that he wasn’t the one who kidnapped your son. It was me. I was also the one who spread the news and lured you here. Chu Feng wasn’t aware of my actions at all.”

Shock rippled across the crowd. Who could have thought that there would be another side to the story? The crowd was left wondering what Miss Bai’s goal was, and whether she had a grudge against the Pill Dao Immortal Sect too.

In the first place, how could Miss Bai be so brazen as to provoke the Pill Dao Immortal Sect? Chu Feng at least had the backing of the Totem Nine Daoists, but what rights did Miss Bai have to do the same?

The crowd was suddenly extremely curious about Miss Bai’s background.

“Chu Feng, I’ll return the debt I owe you at the Ancient Realm today,” Miss Bai told Chu Feng before turning her attention back to Jia Lingyi. “Jia Lingyi, you have committed far too many evil deeds. You’ll pay for them with your and your son's lives!”

Killing intent flared in Miss Bai’s eyes as she prepared to kill Jia Huo.

But before she could make a move, she suddenly found herself frozen on the spot. A formation had held her in place.

“You wench! How dare you oppose me? Do you take me for a pushover?” Jia Lingyi bellowed.

She had been secretly setting up another formation to seal Miss Bai’s movements. In fact, she had only been engaging Miss Bai in a conversation in order to distract her so as to ensure her son’s safety while she was making preparations.

It was only when Miss Bai was curbed that Jia Lingyi finally dared to make a move. She flitted over to Jia Huo’s side and released the noose around his neck.

“You should have thought about the consequences before trying to stand up for Chu Feng,” Jia Lingyi sneered.

“Try touching me, and your Pill Dao Immortal Sect will cease to exist,” Miss Bai sneered.

“Is that so?”

Jia Lingyi suddenly put on a kind smile. She raised her hand and threw out a sound slap on Miss Bai’s face. This single slap caused half of Miss Bai’s face to swell up.

Miss Bai was stunned too. She hadn’t thought that she would get slapped.

“I’ve touched you, but I don’t see any harm befalling my Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Wench, do you think that I’d get intimidated by your tricks that easily? I know that you have a background, but you should know that I, Jia Lingyi, am no simple woman either. Since you insist on helping Chu Feng, I’ll let you know the consequences of doing so,” Jia Lingyi sneered as she prepared to slap the other side of Miss Bai’s face.

“Stop!” Chu Feng suddenly roared. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The incense stick in the Infernal Realm hadn’t burned out yet, but he chose to step out on his own accord. He couldn’t leave Miss Bai to the lurch. The moment he exposed himself, the experts of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect swooped forth to capture him.

Boom!

Before any of them could get close, a formidable shockwave suddenly rippled out from Chu Feng’s raised palm and sent everyone in his vicinity flying. Even the sealing formation they had combined their powers to construct was shattered into pieces.

It was a force surpassing that of Half-Gods, and it was coming from a token in Chu Feng’s hand.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Strongest Token.

It contained not just a protective formation but a summoning formation too. It was with the backing of the Strongest Token that Chu Feng dared to show himself. It might not work in the other galaxies, but it commanded absolute authority in the Totem Galaxy.

Chu Feng had activated not just the protective formation but the summoning formation too.

A beam of light gushed upward, and a massive shadow appeared in the sky and gazed down at the crowd. Soon, an elder appeared amidst the shadows. Just the dragon robe the elder wore was already indicative of his identity.

“It’s the Totem Dragon Clan’s Lord Long Rui!”

“I nearly forgot that Chu Feng has the Strongest Token on him. That’s bound to guarantee his survival!”

Many from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect panicked when they saw Lord Long Rui’s silhouette. While it was only a projection summoned by the Strongest Token, Lord Long Rui was still able to see everything that was happening here.

Lord Long Rui first took a cursory glance before his gaze finally fell on Jia Lingyi.

“Jia Lingyi, what happened?” he asked.

“Lord Long Rui, Chu Feng killed the juniors of our Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Even Jia Chengying has lost his life to him. No matter what it takes, I have to kill this man today. Lord Long Rui, I ask you to turn a blind eye to this,” Jia Lingyi said courteously.

It was clear that the two of them were acquainted.

“Chu Feng, you deserve to die a thousand times over. Did you think that you can run amok just because you have our Totem Dragon Clan’s Strongest Token?” Lord Rui berated Chu Feng without bothering to get to the bottom of the matter.

The crowd was stunned. They hadn’t thought that this would be the result of the summoning.

What Long Rui said next further stunned the crowd.

“Jia Lingyi, I won’t side with a sinner with Chu Feng, but there are many eyes here. It wouldn’t be good if others were to learn of it. I’ll leave you to clean things up,” Long Rui said.

“Rest assured, Lord Long Rui. Not a word of what transpired here will get out,” Jia Lingyi said. With a wave of her sleeves, she constructed yet another sealing formation over the vicinity.

The faces of everyone except for those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect turned pale. They were getting a bad feeling about this. Was Jia Lingyi really planning to massacre all of them?!

Following that, the protective formation that Chu Feng had released through the Strongest Token vanished, though the summoning formation remained. Clearly, this was Long Rui’s doing. He had retracted the protective formation through the Totem Dragon Clan’s formation core.

He had really chosen to side with Jia Lingyi here!

“Turns out the Totem Dragon Clan isn’t anything much either. I never really harbored much expectation of this Strongest Token anyway,” Chu Feng scoffed.

“Chu Feng, you’re the one who has done wrong here. You deserve to die for your evil deeds,” Long Rui scoffed.

“Long Second Dog, aren’t you the one who deserves to die here?” Miss Bai suddenly roared.

Long Rui’s face warped in shock upon hearing those words.

Long Second Dog was his nickname, but no one else other than the highest echelon of the Totem Dragon Clan dared to call him that.

“Who are you?” Long Rui glared at Miss Bai.

“Long Second Dog, you don’t even recognize me?” Miss Bai sneered as she took out a token.

The token emanated a brilliant flash of light, and dragon roars filled the sky. The words ‘Totem Dragon Clan’ were written at the back, and the name ‘Long Muxi’ was written in front.

“Miss Muxi? You’re Miss Muxi?! Long Rui pays respect to Miss Muxi!” Long Rui hurriedly kneeled down and bowed to Miss Bai upon seeing the token.

“She’s Long Muxi?”

The crowd stared at Miss Bai in astonishment. Even Jia Lingyi couldn’t retain her composure anymore. There was no one in the Totem Galaxy who hadn’t heard of Long Muxi.

She was the youngest daughter of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, the number one prodigy of the Totem Dragon Clan before Long Chengyu rose to prominence. It was just that she rarely showed her true face, making her an elusive character even within the Totem Dragon Clan.

Who could have thought that the beautiful Miss Bai would actually be the renowned Long Muxi?

“What’s wrong, Jia Lingyi? Didn’t Jia Chengying tell you that I’m from the Totem Dragon Clan?” Miss Bai looked at Jia Lingyi.

Jia Lingyi frowned.

Jia Chengying had indeed told her that Miss Bai was from the Totem Dragon Clan. After all, Miss Bai had reported her background back in the Ancient Realm in order to escape from there back then.

However, she was so determined to eliminate Chu Feng today that she decided to make a move despite knowing that Miss Bai was from the Totem Dragon Clan. She was intentionally feigning ignorance of Miss Bai’s identity, and she even considered killing Miss Bai too.

She was confident that the Pill Dao Immortal Sect was strong enough to take the repercussions.

For instance, Long Rui was practically one of their people now, having received many benefits from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Given the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s connections in the Totem Dragon Clan, they could definitely get away with murdering a Totem Dragon Clansman.

But who could have thought that Miss Bai was actually Long Muxi, the daughter of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, as well as Long Chengyu’s older sister?

No one in the Totem Dragon Clan would dare side with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect if she really killed her!
