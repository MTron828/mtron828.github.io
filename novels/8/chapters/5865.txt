Chapter 5866: Another Formidable Enemy

When Chu Feng took a second look, he realized that Wen Xue hadn’t really woken up. What was that? Was it just an illusion? No, it couldn’t have been just an illusion.

“Panicked?” Wen Xue’s voice echoed in his ears.

Wen Xue’s eyes remained tightly shut, but Chu Feng was certain the voice had come from her. This meant that the earlier sight he saw was unlikely to be an illusion. Wen Xue must have used some kind of ability to make him see an illusion.

An ability that could deceive Chu Feng was, without a doubt, formidable.

“You did it on purpose? You intentionally saved Zi Ling to evoke the sectmaster and Zi Ling’s guilt, so as to spur me to return your Life Soul to you?” Chu Feng asked via voice transmission.

He sensed that he had fallen for her trap.

“Do I look like that kind of person? Chu Feng, you’re a world spiritist. Can’t you tell that my life was really in danger? If not for my master doting on Zi Ling, I wouldn’t have put myself at risk to save her. I put my life on the line to save your woman, so don’t you think you’re being too much to suspect me?” Wen Xue replied with an angry and indignant voice.

“Why feign asleep when you’re awake? Why don’t we just openly talk things out?” Chu Feng asked.

“I can get up, but I’m angered by how despicable you are. You returned my Life Soul to me, but you secretly placed a binding formation on it. Do you want me to get up now and tell my master and Senior Zi Ling about this?” Wen Xue asked.

“Go ahead. You’re a dangerous existence, so I had to prepare a hand. I wouldn’t have hurt you as long as you didn’t do evil,” Chu Feng said.

“Do evil? You mean... killing your woman?” Wen Xue suddenly asked.

Boom!

A surge of murderous intent poured out of Chu Feng. He lurched forward, grabbed Wen Xue’s collars, and lifted her.

“Chu Feng!!!” The sectmaster and Zi Ling were taken aback.

They were unaware that Wen Xue had regained consciousness; they thought that she was still in a vulnerable, recovering phase.

Chu Feng paid no heed to the two of them. He glared at Wen Xue as he asked, “Why don’t you try repeating those words once more?”

Wen Xue finally opened her eyes. She dropped the act and looked at Chu Feng with indignant eyes, saying, “I’m joking! You don’t have to get so agitated. Be a bit gentler; I haven’t recovered yet.”

“Wen Xue, you’re awake?”

The sectmaster and Zi Ling realized that a conversation must have transpired between Wen Xue and Chu Feng, or else Chu Feng wouldn’t have reacted in such a manner. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Master, I just woke up. Thank you, master. Thank you Senior Zi Ling for pleading on my behalf. Otherwise, Chu Feng wouldn’t have returned my Life Soul to me.” Wen Xue looked at the two of them with aggrieved eyes.

“Junior Wen Xue, what did you say to my big brother Chu Feng?” Zi Ling’s eyes weren’t as gentle as before.

She had helped Wen Xue because she owed the latter one for saving her life, but Chu Feng was far more important to her. She was aware that Wen Xue had once tried to harm Chu Feng, and she wouldn’t hesitate to hurt Wen Xue if she tried to do it again.

“Senior, I was just joking around with Chu Feng,” Wen Xue said.

“What did you joke about?” Zi Ling coldly asked.

Before Wen Xue could reply, Chu Feng interjected, “I didn’t trust Wen Xue. I slipped in a formation into her Life Soul, so she questioned me about it when she regained consciousness.”

He released Wen Xue as he spoke.

“Junior Wen Xue, it’s understandable why Chu Feng doesn’t trust you after what happened between the two of you. I hope that you won’t blame him for doing what he did,” Zi Ling said.

“I know, Senior Zi Ling. I don’t blame him. I have already unraveled the formation anyway,” Wen Xue replied with a bright smile.

Both the sectmaster and Zi Ling were taken aback. This meant that Wen Xue had grown stronger than they had thought.

“Wen Xue, you can’t joke around about everything. You would have died if not for Chu Feng. Hurry up and thank him!” the sectmaster said.

“Thank you, Junior Chu Feng. It should be fine for me to call you that, right?” Wen Xue asked with a sweet smile.

Her fair complexion paired with her young appearance made her look exceptionally obedient. Her smile evoked fondness.

“Wen Xue, you have my gratitude for saving Zi Ling, but we have returned the favor by returning your Life Soul to you. I’ll bury the hatchet between us, but I hope you’ll become a better person. Don’t let down our sectmaster’s expectations of you.

“If you turn over a new leaf and be loyal to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, I’ll treat you well as a fellow sectmember too. Conversely, if you attempt to harm not just Zi Ling but anyone else in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, I won’t let you off the hook,” Chu Feng said.

He walked up to Zi Ling, retracted his killing intent, and grinned. “It’s fine, Zi Ling. She was just joking around with me. I got a little agitated as my nerves were still tense from the earlier battle.”

His smile was so gentle that it looked as if nothing had happened earlier.

“How sweet. I’m envious,” Wen Xue said. She turned to the sectmaster and asked, “Master, how’s the battle outside?”

“It has been settled. You don’t have to worry,” the sectmaster replied.

All of a sudden, her face darkened.

Sensing that something was amiss, Chu Feng and Zi Ling hurriedly asked, “What’s wrong, Lord Sectmaster?”

“Someone else has entered our Ancestral Martial Galaxy.”

“Who is it?” Chu Feng, Zi Ling, and Wen Xue asked.

“It seems to be the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Chu Feng frowned.

...

Three gigantic spirit formation gates had appeared right outside the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Fifty flying warships flew out from the spirit formation gates.

On the deck of the frontmost flying warship stood the experts of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, with Jie Tianran, Chu Feng’s maternal grandfather and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, standing at the very front.

Jie Tianran looked at the massive city that spanned the size of a realm floating in the middle of space with excited eyes.
