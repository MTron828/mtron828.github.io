Chapter 4833: The Bizarre Blood-red Ancient Tower

The Ancient Era teleportation formation here had nothing to do with the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s. However, it was possible to activate the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s teleportation formation through it with a certain treasure, allowing them to swiftly return to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

They rode on the same tattered wooden boat on the way back, but Chu Feng had a grim look on his face. He already knew the way to break the calamity.

When they arrived at the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, the sectmaster would use her full power to activate a formation, and Chu Feng would take control of it to stand against the calamity.

As the saying went, ‘the one who tied the knot has to be the one to unravel it’. Since the calamity had happened due to Chu Feng, he had to be the one to resolve it.

He had been through many of such experiences, so he wasn’t too worried about it.

What he was worried about at the moment was Zi Ling.

He finally understood why Zi Ling’s soul was in such a fragile state.

It all traced back to Chu Feng’s talents.

Zi Ling’s talent actually decent, but there was a cap to her accomplishment. Her talent was actually insufficient for her to reach her current level. The only reason why she was able to reach this high was due to the help offered by Chu Feng’s father.

Chu Feng’s father had planted a unique cultivation treasure in Zi Ling’s dantian. This treasure came from the Ancient Era, and not even Chu Feng’s father knew its name.

He only knew that it would greatly increase Zi Ling’s talent, and if used well, she might even be able to surpass Chu Feng in the future.

According to Zi Ling herself, this treasure looked like a blood-red triangular building, but it was in fact an ancient tower. Close up, one would realize that there were three levels to this blood-red ancient tower, and every floor had a door.

Zi Ling could use this treasure to cultivate, but she needed to fulfill certain conditions.

For one, she had to open all three doors within a given time, or else she would suffer a severe backlash from the blood-red tower. She had already exceeded the allotted time she had to open the first door, but she still hadn’t managed to do it yet.

As a result, the blood-red tower began to harm Zi Ling’s soul.

This was not the first time this had happened, but the backlash was getting worse each time it occurred. It was a warning from the blood-red tower that she would be killed if she still couldn’t open the door. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The sectmaster had intervened to help Zi Ling, but with the backlash growing stronger each time around, it would soon be beyond her means to treat her.

At this rate, it was only a matter of time before Zi Ling died to the blood-red tower.

Chu Feng tried asking Zi Ling if his father had told her of a way to control the blood-red tower. He thought that his father wouldn’t have done something he wasn’t confident of since he had already decided to help Zi Ling.

However, Zi Ling said that there was no other way out of this.

Back then, Chu Feng’s father had proposed various ways to help her, and this blood-red ancient tower was the most effective but dangerous one.

Zi Ling insisted on choosing the blood-red ancient tower, refusing all other options. Seeing how obstinate she was, Chu Feng’s father eventually chose to let her have her way.

This was also why Zi Ling apologized to Chu Feng when she suffered the backlash of the blood-red ancient tower, saying that it was her fault. It was indeed her fault since she was the one who chose this path.

Wuu!

All of a sudden, Zi Ling let out a pained whimper. She raised her head and saw Chu Feng and everyone else staring at her with anxious looks.

Chu Feng could tell from the pained look on her face that she was suffering from the backlash of the blood-red ancient tower once again.

The sectmaster quickly took out a gourd and poured out a pill from it.

Chu Feng had seen this pill before. It was the one which the white skirt woman used to treat Zi Ling previously.

The sectmaster infused the pill into Zi Ling’s forehead.

Hu!

The pill turned into a wisp of smoke that seeped into Zi Ling’s body, alleviating her pain and stabilizing her condition.

Even though Zi Ling was still holding on for the time being, the sectmaster couldn’t help but feel even more worried.

“Sectmaster, why is it acting up so quickly?” Chu Feng asked worriedly.

“Chu Feng, I’m no longer able to suppress Zi Ling’s condition anymore. This pill was left to me by the elder of our sect, but there are only nine of them in here. With how frequent Zi Ling’s backlashes are occurring, it wouldn’t be long before all nine are used up. If Zi Ling is still unable to resolve her condition by then, no one would be able to help her anymore.

“I didn’t allow Zi Ling to leave the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect previously due to her affliction, but it looks like I no longer have the power to protect her anymore. You should take her away with you from once you break the calamity and do whatever you want to.”

The sectmaster’s words left clutched Chu Feng’s heart tightly.

She was saying that Zi Ling didn’t have long to live, and they should try to fulfill whatever remaining wishes Zi Ling had with her remaining time.

Chu Feng quickly walked over to Zi Ling’s side to grab her wrist and check her soul’s condition.

While Zi Ling’s was still safe for the time being, her soul was still in an unstable state.

Chu Feng took out his Hidden Dragon Soul Armor and put it on Zi Ling. While it couldn’t solve her affliction, it could at least strengthen her soul.

Chu Feng was just intending to give it a try, but to his surprise, as soon as he placed the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor on Zi Ling, her soul began regenerating at a swift pace. Even her complexion looked much better than before.

“Ths Hidden Dragon Soul Armor can actually help Zi Ling?”

Both Duan Liufeng and the sectmaster were delighted to see this turn of affairs. This was indubitably a good thing.

Chu Feng also felt incredibly relieved too. As difficult as it was for him to acquire the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor, he was glad that it was able to help Zi Ling for the time being.

“That is?”

A blood-red mist suddenly emerged from Zi Ling’s dantian and started to devour the Hidden Draogn Soul Armor.

The Hidden Dragon Soul Armor was a valuable treasure, but the blood-red mist was able to swiftly break it down and assimilate it.

“Ki ki ki...”

A peal of terrifying laughter sounded from Zi Ling’s soul.

“Brat, you sure are generous. It’s just that your wife is simply too weak. In view of the rich soul energy in your armor, I’ll magnanimously grant her a year’s time. If she’s still unable to open the door by then, it would mean that she’s truly unqualified to use our powers. If so, I’ll definitely take her life!”

“Elder, could I use other soul energy-related treasures to sustain her life?” Chu Feng quickly asked.

However, there was no response. Duan Liufeng and the sectmaster also looked at Chu Feng in incomprehension.

“Big brother Chu Feng, who are you talking to?”

Even Zi Ling appeared to be confused by Chu Feng’s actions.

It would seem that Chu Feng was the only one who heard the voice earlier on.
