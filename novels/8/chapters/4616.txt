Chapter 4616: Unique Treasure

“You want to work together? Sure, of course,” Chu Feng answered right away.

“Aren’t you going to at least think about it?”

Xia Yan widened his eyes in surprise after seeing how quickly Chu Feng responded. He was a little surprised.

“I’m only at rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation whereas you’re at rank four. If you’re offering your huge thighs for me to clutch onto, there’s no reason why I should refuse your offer,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

His expression looked both innocent and earnest.

“Bro, you sure are a forthright person. Welcome onboard then! Remember, it’s a partnership among the three of us.”

Xia Yan glanced at Xiao Yu as he spoke, and Xiao Yu also shot a glance at Chu Feng too.

Clearly, Xiao Yu had also agreed to the alliance too. However, based on the look on Xiao Yu’s face, it was apparent that the only one he was interested in working with was Xia Yan. Or to be more exact, Xiao Yu carried no expectations for Chu Feng at all, possibly averse to the idea even.

On the other hand, Chu Feng didn’t care about Xiao Yu’s view at all. He could already sense the hostility that the juniors of the Gongsun Clan carried against him, or to be more precise, it was the three of them.

Under such circumstances, it was understandable for the three of them to join hands with one another. Otherwise, they would be completely helpless if the juniors of the Gongsun Clan made a move against them during the challenge...

... though, to be honest, it was questionable whether they would stand a chance against the juniors of the Gongsun Clan even then. After all, the Gongsun Clan had the terrifying Gongsun Yuntian with them.

One must know that a world spiritist who had grasped rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation was equivalent to a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator. There was none of them who would stand a match against that!

Still, their odds were still better if they put their strength together.

As long as Gongsun Yuntian didn’t get involved, they could still put up a fight against the other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.

After Chu Feng agreed to team up with them, Xia Yan fulfilled the end of his promise and shared the origins of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace with him.

As it turned out, the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace was quite an elusive treasure. No one knew where it came from, but it was known that there were many fortuitous encounters hidden amidst it. It was a land of treasure for world spiritists, with valuable items and growth opportunities awaiting them.

So, if the location of the challenge was really the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, it would indeed be a hard-to-come-by opportunity for them.

If they were lucky enough to obtain good stuff in there, even if they were to lose the matchmaking convention, their trip would still have not been in vain.

Chu Feng was also overjoyed to hear that the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace was such a good place. As long as there were fortuitous encounters in there, he was confident that he wouldn’t return empty-handed.

Of course, Chu Feng and Xia Yan had spoken through voice transmission, so none of those from the Gongsun Clan were aware that the three of them had already allied with one another yet.

While they were chatting, the Wretched Black Demon formed seals with a single hand while directing the other one toward the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace.

A powerful surge of spirit power was pumped steadily into the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, causing it to tremble ever so slightly. Under the influx of spirit power, the doors of the palace began to open.

Chu Feng noticed that there were sweat droplets on the face of the Wretched Black Demon. His face remained mostly nonchalant, but just the sweat droplets were enough to show how much of a strain it was to activate the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace.

Even though Chu Feng wasn’t certain just how powerful the Wretched Black Demon was, he could still sense that the latter was incredibly formidable from the spirit power he was releasing at the moment.

At the very least, it was safe to say that there was no one in the present Holy Light Galaxy who could rival him.

Yet, such a powerful existence was having trouble opening the doors of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. This made Chu Feng view the palace in a new light.

“Hey, Brother Xia Yan. Didn’t you mention that the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace is a treasure of the Wretched Black Demon? Why is he having trouble trying to activate it then?”

Chu Feng posed his doubts to Xia Yan.

“How could it possibly be easy to activate the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace? Even though it’s his possession, the palace has its own sentience. The Wretched Black Demon actually doesn’t have much control over it. If I have to describe it, it’s more of an equal relationship between the two of them.

“It’s said that the Wretched Black Demon has to infuse a huge amount of spirit power into the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace every single day for thirty years in order to open it once,” Xia Yan replied.

“Thirty years? The procedure is actually this troublesome?” Chu Feng was astonished to hear that news. “Then why is the Wretched Black Demon handing this opportunity to us instead of using it for his own people?”

Chu Feng felt that there was something really amiss here.

Even though the Wretched Black Demon had been maintaining a smile on his face thus far, making him look like someone who was easy to get along with, Chu Feng was certain that it was just a facade. Otherwise, the Wretched Black Demon wouldn’t have such notoriety in the Nine Souls Galaxy.

It was unthinkable for someone like that to help outsiders like Chu Feng for no reason.

“Bro, you’re right on point there. First and foremost, only juniors are allowed to enter the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. As formidable as the Wretched Black Demon is, he’s unable to enter the premises, so he’s unable to obtain anything good from there.

“Other than that, I’ve also heard something very important regarding the palace, but I can’t verify the authenticity of the news since it’s mostly just rumors.”

“Tell me about it,” Chu Feng asked curiously.

“I heard that as long as juniors obtain a treasure or growth opportunity in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, the palace would produce a special kind of energy. It’s said that this energy brings the Wretched Black Demon a huge benefit, enhancing his spirit power,” Xia Yan said.

“In other words, the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace is actually a treasure that’s used to enhance one’s spirit power. However, in order to activate his effect, he needs to send juniors in there and fulfill some criteria?” Chu Feng sought clarification for his comprehension of the matter.

“Yes, that’s roughly it. However, I need to emphasize once more that the latter part came from rumors. The Wretched Black Demon has never acknowledged it before. He claims that the reason why he opens the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace is to bring some fortuitous encounters to the juniors of the Nine Souls Galaxy and help them in their growth,” Xia Yan said.

Chu Feng could only laugh wryly after hearing those words.

He felt that Xia Yan’s explanation was still quite reasonable. His gut feeling was telling him that the Wretched Black Demon wasn’t a good person.

However, if the Wretched Black Demon benefited from having the opportunities in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace exploited, that would explain it all.

Bam bam bam—

It took a whole half an hour before the doors of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace finally opened. A massive spirit formation gate surfaced.

“Young friends, I believe that most of you have heard of my Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace before, so I shan’t waste our time elaborating more about it. I’ll put it out clearly today. If you encounter any treasures inside the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, as long as you have the strength to claim it for your own, you are more than free to take it away.

“However, there’s one thing that I ought to warn you beforehand. You can use your powers inside the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, but you mustn’t attempt to harm one another. I can turn a blind eye to anything you do elsewhere, but in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, I hope that you can get along with one another.

“If anyone were to attack you, you can tell me once you’re out of the palace. I’ll remove his candidacy in this matchmaking convention!

“Only the first five people to leave the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace will be allowed to enter the round of the challenge. You must be sure to grasp this opportunity well.”

“Elder, please don’t worry. I’ll definitely heed your instructions and do my best.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The seven prodigies of the Gongsun Clan expressed their views together at once.

Seeing this, Chu Feng and Xia Yan quickly followed suit too.

In truth, the three of them would hope more than anything to get along with the others, but they knew deep down that those from the Gongsun Clan had no such intention in mind.

“Alright. I’ve already entrusted the opportunity into your hands. How much you can get out of this depends on yourselves!” the Wretched Black Demon said with a wave of his hand.

Right after he finished his actions, the seven prodigies of the Gongsun Clan made a move simultaneously. They rose into the air and entered the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace.

“Bro, take this and don’t move around carelessly once you get in. Wait for me to find you.”

Just as Chu Feng was about to move, Xia Yan secretly slipped him a talisman paper. Without even taking a look at it, Chu Feng was already able to tell what the use of it was through his spirit power.

It was a location talisman, and a special one at that. It would only last for a very short moment, but its effects were more than enough to make up for its limited duration.

Shoosh shoosh—

After passing the talisman paper over to Chu Feng, Xia Yan and Yu Xiao soared into the air and entered the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace.

The only one left on the square was Chu Feng.

Chu Feng could sense that everyone’s eyes were on him, but the nature of their gazes wasn’t anything flattering. They were waiting to see him make a laughingstock out of himself.

None of them carried any expectations of Chu Feng, thinking that he was a clown standing amidst the others.

However, Chu Feng paid no heed to that. He smiled faintly in response before rising into the air too to pass through the massive spirit formation gate, entering the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace.

As soon as Chu Feng passed through the spirit formation gate, he scanned his surroundings but no one was in his vicinity.

He turned around to take a look, but the massive spirit formation gate had already vanished without a trace. What was left behind him was only a massive wall, which meant that there was no path for retreat.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng wasn’t surprised at this situation at all.

Back then, when Xia Yan handed the location talisman to him, he had already known that they would be divided once they passed through the spirit formation gate.
