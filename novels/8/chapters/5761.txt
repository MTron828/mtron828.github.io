Chapter 5761: The Legendary Power, Genesis Bloodline

Chu Feng was able to make a breakthrough thanks to the two pearls from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan, but he had already reached the consumption limit by assimilating the two of them. He wouldn’t be able to anymore even if he obtained new ones.

He could still use the cultivation ground, and he would likely be able to make a breakthrough in due time if he continued cultivating in it, but it was unlikely he could do so in the near term.

“Huangfu Jiangyao said that the cultivation ground is not just for cultivation but for assessment too. Someone has to clear its test for the Nine Heavens’ Zenith to commence. Could the assessment formation be hidden in the third layer of the cultivation ground? Let me give it a try.”

Chu Feng sat down and focused his attention on the cultivation ground. Soon, energies from nine-colored lightning and the Ruler’s Bloodline energy seeped out of his body and fused with the cultivation ground.

…

Meanwhile, Huangfu Shengyu, Huangfu Jiangyao, Huangfu Shangyang, Huangfu Shangwu, and Huangfu Fanni were gathered in a rundown house. Huangfu Shengyu sat cross-legged with his eyes closed, but his complexion looked awful.

Meanwhile, Huangfu Jiangyao and the others stood by the side, glancing at one another but not daring to speak a word. In the end, Huangfu Jiangyao gritted his teeth and said, “Young master, Chu Feng cheated by relying on his world spirit. He would have lost if he used his true strength.”

Huangfu Shengyu suddenly opened his eyes, revealing an incomparably sharp gaze. Huangfu Jiangyao immediately shut his mouth in fear.

“Do you think I’d be bothered by something as minor as that?” Huangfu Shengyao asked.

“That’s not what I mean, young master. I…”

“I lost to Chu Feng this time—I can concede as much. It’s a lesson learned. Chu Feng is different from the others. It’d be unwise to underestimate him. However, since I am here at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, I can’t allow anyone else to take the title of the strongest. I won’t be a match for him under normal circumstances, but the battles in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith aren’t that simple, not to mention that we are in control of the situation here.

“Once I grasp the cultivation ground’s formation, I’ll commence the Nine Heavens’ Zenith in one shot. I’ll have the world know Chu Feng is nothing. I’m the one pushing things along. If not for me, they wouldn’t even have a chance to fight in the tournament!” Huangfu Shengyu said.

Huangfu Jiangyao and the others voiced their agreement.

“Of course! Who else other than our young master has the qualification to commence the Nine Heavens’ Zenith?”

“Enough, you head out first. You’ll only be a bother to me here,” Huangfu Shengyu said.

Huangfu Jiangyao and the others walked out, but they didn’t leave the vicinity. They lingered at the doorway to await Huangfu Shengyu’s good news.

In truth, they hadn’t entered the cultivation grounds at all due to the special nature of their cultivation skills. They wouldn’t enter any other cultivation formations other than their clan’s. Thus, they had been camping outside Huangfu Shengyu’s residence, waiting for him to breach the formation.

Despite being gathered in one place, the four of them didn’t chat at all as if they had no feelings for one another.

Shortly after, the earth started shaking, and the night sky began to glow.

“This phenomenon… Did our young master succeed?”

Huangfu Jiangyao and the others were initially unsure whether this was the right phenomenon, but they soon heard Liu Kuo’s voice.

“Someone has cleared the cultivation ground’s assessment formation. The Nine Heavens’ Zenith will be commencing. Please gather in the square by mao hour tomorrow. We’ll be determining the strongest prodigy in the world of cultivation among you.” (5AM to 7AM)

Liu Kuo’s words dispelled Huangfu Jiangyao and the others’ suspicions.

“Young master succeeded so quickly! As expected of our young master!”

Huangfu Jiangyao and the others were delighted. They had been worried that Huangfu Shengyu would be in a bad mood due to Chu Feng, but his feat of commencing the Nine Heavens’ Zenith should alleviate his displeasure.

Thus, they pushed the door open to congratulate him, only to be startled when they encountered a livid-faced Huangfu Shengyu. The first thing they noticed was that Huangfu Shengyu hadn’t even stepped into the cultivation ground yet, which meant that he wasn’t the one behind the phenomenon.

Someone else had achieved this feat.

…

“Huangfu Jiangyao was right. The cultivation ground does have a hidden assessment formation. Is this Huangfu Shengyu’s doing?”

The others in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith speculated about this matter. They already had an answer in their minds, but they were reluctant to believe it after how Huangfu Shengyu and the others made light of them.

If not for Chu Feng defeating Huangfu Shengyu with his True God level world spirit, the cultivators of the present era wouldn’t be able to stand with their heads held high anymore.

Even though Huangfu Shengyu had lost the spar, no one dared to make light of him, especially after witnessing his strength and the treasures he had in his possession.

They felt a little flustered, as they didn’t know whether Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu could defeat the Huangfu Heavenly Clan to secure the title of the strongest and uphold the reputation of the cultivators of the present era.

Meanwhile, Liu Kuo was pacing around his room, holding onto his prayer beads with a face mixed by joy and worry. His fast footsteps and rapid breathing were signs of his nervousness.

“Please, Brother Chu Feng, you have to succeed. I’ll follow you from this day onward if you can awaken that legendary power,” Liu Kuo murmured.

Through the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation, he could tell that Chu Feng had breached the assessment formation to commence the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, but there was actually another layer on top of that.

If Chu Feng could breach that layer too, he could awaken the legendary power.

Grar!

All of a sudden, there was a deafening roar from outside the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. It was so domineering that it shook the souls of the prodigies, causing their hearts to clench up.

“What is that?”

The crowd was terrified. The more cowardly ones dared not stay in their residences anymore and rushed out to the square.

However, Liu Kuo halted his footsteps and looked upward. The others could not see what was happening outside, but he, who was in control of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation, was able to clearly see everything. The edges of his lips crept upward, and ravenous joy showed in his moist eyes.

“Is he really going to succeed?”

…

It was a complete mess outside the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. It should have been night, yet it was brighter than day. A golden light had covered the entire realm. The earlier domineering roar had come from none other than the golden light.

This was no ordinary phenomenon. The golden light felt like a living entity, an extraordinary power. Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master stepped out of his floating palace to examine the phenomenon.

“Could this be the legendary power?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master murmured in uncertainty.

Meanwhile, Song Changsheng’s eyes were filled with shock too. From outer space, he saw a golden light enveloping the entire realm as if devouring it whole. The pressure emanated by the golden light was so great that it was beyond his means to deal with.

“It worked! Is it Chu Feng, or is it the doing of an even more talented prodigy?” Song Changsheng wondered. “So, this is the juniors of the present generation, the strongest generation in the history of the world of cultivation. They… actually awakened it!”

He was delighted, but at the same time, he also felt indignant and helpless. He knew what the golden light enveloping the realm was. This was the power he and Chu Xuanyuan had tried everything they could to awaken but to no avail—the Genesis Bloodline!
