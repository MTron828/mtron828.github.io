Chapter 4026 - The Change In The Bloodline

“Master, what you’re doing, isn’t it a bit too cunning?”

“This wouldn’t be fair anymore.”

Yuan Shu narrowed his brows slightly. Even though it was his master doing this, the righteous Yuan Shu still complained about the injustice for Chu Feng.

“Cunning? Fair?”

Grandmaster Tang Chen disapproved of Yuan Shu’s criticisms, and was even slightly annoyed.

“Humph. In terms of cunning, how could I be as cunning as that old bastard Ox-nose?”

“Rest assured. If you are to attempt to breach that Ox-nose’s spirit formation, you will most definitely return in defeat too.”

“I know extremely well what sort of person that old bastard is.”

“All these years, I’ve never won against him once. What sort of despicable method has he not used against me?”

“Since you’re destined to fail, I will naturally have to make his disciple fail too.”

“At the very least, I can guarantee that I will not lose this gamble by doing that.”

Grandmaster Tang Chen became emotional as he said those words.

From his behavior, one could tell how he had suffered at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s hands. Although they were close friends, he still held great resentment toward him.

“Master, is this gamble really that important?” asked Yuan Shu.

“Of course it is. If it weren’t, why would this old man go through all the effort to meticulously nurture you?”

“This old man has lost to that old bastard too many times. This time, I will definitely win against him. At the very least, I cannot afford to lose again.”

Grandmaster Tang Chen became even more emotional. He even revealed a look of anger.

Facing Grandmaster Tang Chen acting like this, Yuan Shu immediately shut his mouth.

Even though Yuan Shu was someone who dared to bluntly say anything to his master, he actually felt great fear for his master from the bottom of his heart.

Whenever his master got angry, Yuan Shu would immediately become terrified. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Roar~~~”

Right at this moment, strange sounds began to sound from the spirit formation entrance.

These sounds were completely different from the sounds earlier.

Sensing that those sounds were strange, Yuan Shu immediately turned his gaze over.

It was only then that he discovered those sounds were being emitted by the seven enormous world spirits.

The seven enormous world spirits still appeared so very sacred, like the gods of that world.

Yet, painful expressions were present on their malevolent faces. Even their roars sounded more like miserable shrieks.

Indeed, those were miserable shrieks. Those seven enormous world spirits were actually shrieking.

Although they were screams of misery, they remained as ear-piercing as before. Like the explosions of millions of thunderbolts, their screams engulfed that entire world.

As those screams wreaked havoc throughout the world, it began to crumble and collapse.

Space itself started shattering.

“Master, what is going on here?”

“Why would there suddenly be such a change?”

Yuan Shu was both astonished and confused. He turned to his master to seek an answer.

It was only then that he discovered his master had disappeared.

“Huh, Master?”

“Master? Master? Master?”

Yuan Shu called for his master a couple more times. Yet, he did not receive any response from his master.

“Why would master suddenly disappear at such a crucial time?”

“Isn’t this a bit too unreliable?”

“With how complicated you made that spirit formation, how exactly am I supposed to watch it? The more I watch, the more confused I become. I don’t even know what exactly is going on in there,” Yuan Shu complained. He was complaining about his master leaving without explaining anything to him.

This caused him to have no idea what was going on at a crucial moment. Because of that, he felt rather depressed to be unable to enjoy the show.

That said, Yuan Shu still turned his gaze back to the spirit formation entrance.

Since his master was no longer here, he could only watch on his own, and see if he could guess what exactly was happening inside the spirit formation.

“Strange. Brother Chu Feng’s bloodline power seems to have changed.”

Suddenly, Yuan Shu’s eyes started to shine.

He discovered that the bloodline power coming from Chu Feng’s body had changed.

That power was even more intense than before. It was also emitting a light. Although that light was not dazzling, Yuan Shu felt a change to the depths of his soul when he saw that light. It was a sensation resembling fear.

“What’s going on? Why would I feel such oppression just by seeing that bloodline power? Furthermore... I’m feeling slightly afraid?”

“Could it be?!”

Yuan Shu’s reaction changed completely. Disbelief filled his eyes.

He knew what was feeling afraid in the depths of his soul.

It was the bloodline power hidden in the depths of his soul, his world spiritist bloodline.

Since ancient times, only stronger bloodlines were capable of causing bloodline fear.

“Could it be that brother Chu Feng’s bloodline’s power has reached a different realm?”

When this thought came to his mind, Yuan Shu’s breathing began to accelerate.

Furthermore, he discovered that once Chu Feng’s bloodline’s power changed, the look of pain also disappeared from his face.

Chu Feng’s expression turned tranquil. He appeared to be sacred.

But, there was clearly no change to him apart from... his bloodline’s power.

“Boom~~~”

“Boom~~~”

“Boom~~~”

Explosions sounded in succession and fragmenters filled the sky. In the blink of an eye, that world shattered completely, and turned into a pitch-black world of nothingness.

Those seven enormous world spirits were also shattering and disintegrating.

However, they did not die completely. Rather, after they shattered, they turned into seven enormous bodies of energy that began to drift in the void.

Those bodies of energy were exceptionally terrifying. Like ferocious beasts capable of devouring the sky, they covered the entire void with their enormous bodies and began to wreak havoc.

The world Chu Feng was in had already crumbled. Pitch-black void filled his surroundings.

With the seven bodies of energy wreaking havoc in a world like this, they appeared exceptionally terrifying.

If those seven bodies of energy were gods in this world before, they’d turned to demons intending on destroying everything after they shattered.

That said, this sort of situation did not last for long.

Soon, the shattered world began to restore itself. It returned to how it was before.

Even the collapsed forests and the crumbled mountain range returned to their original appearance. Even the dead birds and beasts had reappeared.

As the world was restored to how it was, the seven bodies of energy wreaking havoc began to dissipate.

Soon, the world was completely restored.

Cranes were flying high in the sky. Ferocious beasts were roaring in the mountains. Butterflies were dancing around blooming flowers.

The sight was identical to when Chu Feng had first entered.

Seeing that sight now, things appeared so very precious. After all, everything had disappeared earlier.

As for Chu Feng, he was still sitting there cross-legged. The only difference compared to before was that his body was emitting a faint glimmer.

That light was his world spiritist bloodline’s power.

His bloodline’s power had turned into light that revolved around him. From a glance, one would feel completely astonished.

The reason for that was because the current Chu Feng, compared to the seven enormous world spirits earlier, appeared more like the god of this world.

“Could it be that brother Chu Feng managed to successfully breach the spirit formation?” Yuan Shu was feeling secretly delighted.

No matter how he looked at it, it seemed like Chu Feng had managed to breach the grand formation.

It was Chu Feng who had restored that world to its previous beautiful state.

Furthermore, it seemed like Chu Feng had become the ruler of that world.

This performance of becoming the owner of a spirit formation, was it not the sign of successfully breaching it?

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, ear-piercing rumbles sounded from the depths of the highest sky.

An enormous shadow appeared high in the sky.

Once that shadow appeared, it immediately enveloped heaven and earth.

That world was once again covered in darkness.

Upon closer inspection, it was actually a figure located in the depths of the sky. One could not see the appearance or the clear shape of that figure clearly. However, it was so enormous that it covered the entire world.

Even if those seven enormous world spirits from earlier were added together, they would not even be as big as one-hundredth the size of the silhouette in the sky.

Once that silhouette appeared, an enormous palm extended toward Chu Feng.

“Rumble~~~”

Space shattered wherever that palm passed. Everything in its path turned to ruin.

The world that had restored itself was once again destroyed with the descent of that palm.

Even though that palm was still very far away from Chu Feng, the enormous wind caused by the palm had arrived at him already.

The wind caused his clothes to flutter all about. His long hair was surging violently, and a look of pain grew more and more intense on Chu Feng’s face.
