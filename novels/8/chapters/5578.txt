Chapter 5578: Hurry Up and Stow It Away

“Big brother, you’re amazing. I didn’t think that you could actually tame Jie Tian.” Little Fishy shot a thumbs-up at Chu Feng.

She had interacted with Jie Tian more than Chu Feng. While she looked down on Jie Tian, she had to admit that he was someone with grit. It was no easy feat to make him submit.

“I’m not the one who’s amazing here. It’s Chaotic Era Scholar,” Chu Feng said.

If not for Chaotic Era Scholar’s powerful restriction formation torturing Jie Tian, it was unlikely that the latter would have submitted to Chu Feng that easily.

“Yes, it’s indeed formidable.” Little Fishy nodded in agreement, having tasted the prowess of the restriction formation herself.

The group continued to advance amidst their chatter.

The surrounding fog severely limited their visibility to a level no different from an ordinary human despite the means they possessed, so the three of them proceeded with utmost caution.

Shoosh shoosh!

Jie Tian, who walked at the forefront of the group, suddenly formed a series of hand seals and constructed a protective formation. He seemed to be guarded against something.

Chu Feng and Little Fishy noticed that something was hidden in the fog ahead too. They put up their guards and carefully advanced ahead. Soon, they discovered three stone tablets. None of the stone tablets was blocking their path, but they still examined them, knowing there was more to them.

Chu Feng was able to decipher the contents of two of the stone tablets, and he found two formations in them—a riddle formation and a talent assessment formation. Based on this, he deduced that there was a formation in the last stone tablet too, and they needed to decipher them if they wanted a smooth passageway ahead.

Otherwise, they could bump into trouble.

The only problem was that Chu Feng couldn’t see through the third stone tablet. He turned his attention to Little Fishy, as he realized that her eyes were fixed on the third stone tablet.

“Did you notice something?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s a bloodline formation. We’ll likely acquire something once it’s deciphered. I’m not sure what it is, but I suspect that it’ll be useful later on,” Little Fishy said.

“Are you able to breach it?” Chu Feng asked.

He could only think of two possibilities why Little Fishy was the only one who could decipher the content on the stone tablet. The first possibility was that Little Fishy had a much more discerning eye than him, and the second one was that the stone tablet was prepared specifically for her.

Chu Feng was more inclined toward the second possibility since he didn’t think that the first one was too likely.

“Leave this formation to me.” Little Fishy winked at Chu Feng.

“I’ll leave that bloodline formation to you then,” Chu Feng said. He then turned to Jie Tian, who was examining the first and second stone tablet, and asked, “You should be able to see through these two stone tablets, right?”

“Hmph!” Jie Tian harrumphed in disdain. “Feel free to choose either of the stone tablets; I can breach both of them. If you can’t even do that much, you can step aside and see how I do it.”

Those words were spoken arrogantly as if he was gleeful at having finally found a chance to mock Chu Feng.

“You can breach that one,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle as he pointed to the talent assessment formation. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He then channeled his spirit power toward the first stone tablet. The first stone tablet shattered upon contact with his spirit power, transforming into a formation that enveloped him.

Jie Tian sneered at that sight, though he made sure not to make a noise lest Chu Feng punish him upon seeing that. He didn’t think that Chu Feng could breach the first formation as he was certain that these two formations were prepared for him, and thus, he was the only one who could breach them.

He thought that Chu Feng was arrogant for even attempting it, and he was more than happy to see the latter make a fool of himself.

Soon, the three formations were activated. The three of them started working on breaching their respective formations at the same time. It looked like the formations were prepared specifically for the three of them; it wouldn’t do if any of them backed out.

The riddle formation Chu Feng faced was so difficult that he didn’t think Jie Tian could breach it, though it didn’t pose much of a challenge to him. He had inherited Qin Jiu’s heritage, after all, making him unrivaled in the field of deciphering formations.

He could easily deal with any formations that were not beyond his spirit power. It only took him moments to breach the riddle formation.

The riddle formation shattered, and its spirit power converged together to form a formation key. Chu Feng took the formation key and examined it, but he didn’t find anything special about it.

He then turned his attention toward Little Fishy and Jie Tian.

The other two formations were no pushovers either.

Little Fishy’s formation was the most spectacular one—the space contained within it was so huge that it looked like a world in itself. Boundless energy harnessing destructive might flowed within the formation. Any surge of energy from it could have easily destroyed entire cities.

These surges of energy converged together to assault Little Fishy as if a ferocious beast, but the latter didn’t look flustered at all. An incredible wave containing countless savage eyes had built up around her. These savage eyes belonged to extremely powerful sea beasts.

As powerful as those surges of energy were, they weren’t able to overcome the sea beasts.

Chu Feng could feel just how powerful Little Fishy’s bloodline was. He could tell from her relaxed face that this bloodline formation didn’t pose a problem to her at all.

“She’s strong,” Chu Feng remarked.

“She sure is. There are many women in the world, but she’s the only one worthy of you in terms of talent. You should quickly take her in lest others steal her,” Eggy said.
