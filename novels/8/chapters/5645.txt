Chapter 5645: Ferocious Beast Altar

“Are you for real? That’s not what I heard,” the man said.

“What I’m saying is the absolute truth. Only those with direct blood ties with her can use the dagger, such as her parents and her offspring. Even her blood siblings won’t be able to use the dagger,” Chu Shanshan said.

The crowd harbored skepticism toward Chu Shanshan’s words, since it contrasted with what they had heard.

“Why would something that valuable be left here?”

Another question soon arose in the crowd’s minds.

Chu Feng had been examining the altar as well, but he couldn’t discern anything from it. Nevertheless, he had his guesses.

“The formation placed on the Purpledemon Dagger is a sealing formation, which suggests that there might be something under the altar. Lord Jie Ranqing likely used this dagger to suppress something,” Chu Feng analyzed.

“Something is suppressed beneath the altar? Could this be where Lord Jie Ranqing sealed the tens of millions of ferocious beasts?”

The horrified crowd quickly backed away from the altar.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng tried grabbing the Purpledemon Dagger, which made the dagger shudder. His bloodline ability, including his Ruler’s Bloodline, began surging toward the Purpledemon Dagger.

Chu Shanshan was right. Those with direct blood ties with Jie Ranqing were indeed able to use the Purpledemon Dagger.

Chu Feng could have pulled the Purpledemon Dagger out, but he constructed a formation and feigned that he had been burned by the dagger instead.

On the one hand, he didn’t want to reveal his identity here, fearing that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion might eliminate him. On the other hand, he knew that it would be unwise to remove the Purpledemon Dagger, especially since it was likely sealing the ferocious beasts.

Furthermore, he noticed that the spirit power inside the dagger had been fused into the altar. Despite being only at Golden Dragon God-cloak then, Jie Ranqing constructed a formation that was on par with Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists. The formation was extremely complicated and specific, such that Chu Feng struggled to make sense of it.

By the time Chu Feng released his grip, the crowd was already staring at him with shocked eyes. They noticed how the Purpledemon Dagger had shuddered at his touch, when it didn’t react at all earlier when that man grabbed it. Furthermore, Chu Feng lasted much longer than that man even though his palm was burned as well.

“Young master Chu Feng, are you all right?” Chu Shanshan asked concernedly.

She was more worried about Chu Feng’s injuries.

“Yes, I’m all right,” Chu Feng replied. “I’m certain now that the Purpledemon Dagger harnesses a powerful sealing formation, just that the sealing formation is embedded deep inside the altar, which is why we can’t sense it on the outside. My guess is that this is the place where Lord Jie Ranqing sealed the tens of millions of ferocious beasts.”

“I see…”

The crowd believed Chu Feng’s judgment, which further stoked their fears concerning the altar.

“You don’t need to be too worried. Lord Jie Ranqing has already sealed the beasts, so it’s no longer dangerous here. The true danger lies ahead of us,” Chu Feng said before marching on.

The crowd quickly followed him.

Not too long later, they stumbled upon a ten-meters tall tree. The tree was completely withered, with not a leaf to be seen on its branches, but it had a glowing fruit. It was a white fruit shaped like a peach.

Chu Feng’s eyes lit up with excitement.

“Is that the fruit that enhances the psyche Lord Jie Ranqing mentioned?”

The crowd looked at the fruit with expectant eyes, but no one dared to recklessly make a move. They knew that it was wiser to follow Chu Feng’s instructions, and they thought that he was the only one among them qualified to enjoy the fruit too.

Chu Feng raised his hand and exerted a powerful suction force on the fruit, but he was unable to pick the fruit.

Grar!

A deep growl suddenly echoed from the withered tree.

The soil overturned, and a monster with a tortoise-like physique but eight claws rose from the ground. It looked at the crowd with eerie white eyes. The withered tree was growing on its back.

It turned out that the tree was part of the monster’s body, and any attempt to pick the fruit would awaken it. The monster opened its mouth wide and charged at Chu Feng and the others.

However, Chu Feng was prepared for its assault. With a wave of his wrist, a massive formation blade fell from the sky and sliced the monster into two.

He raised his hand to grab the fruit once more. This time around, the fruit flew right into his hand.

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng took a bite off the fruit.

The fruit’s texture and flavor were similar to that of a peach, but it was much more delectable. On top of that, it had no seed at all.

“Tastes not bad,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.

There was indeed psyche power infused inside the fruit, but its effect was insignificant to him. He felt an imprint forming on his body, but it was so faint that special detection means were required to see it.

The group continued marching ahead, and they encountered more monster trees along the way. Every single one of them had a fruit on their back. Chu Feng was able to slay them with ease, and he shared the fruits with the crowd.

It didn’t take long for everyone to have a taste of the white fruit.

As they ventured deeper, they started finding silver fruits too. These silver fruits were growing on the back of tortoise-like monsters, and these tortoise-like monsters were stronger than those with white fruits. These silver fruits boosted one’s psyche to a greater degree, and the imprint it left was much more distinct.

Soon enough, they encountered golden and copper fruits too, with the copper fruit being more potent than the golden and silver fruits. However, the tortoise-like monsters linked to the copper fruits were at rank five Half-God level.

Only Chu Feng had the strength to deal with the copper fruit monsters.

Chu Feng slayed all of the ferocious beasts they encountered along the way and shared the fruits with the crowd. Everyone obtained at least three copper fruits.

However, Chu Feng suddenly halted his footsteps at this point.

While they had been traveling under the lightning cloud, the lightning was concentrated at the center. They were now extremely close to the center of the lightning cloud, and the threat they felt from their surroundings was greater than ever.

“I can only bring you all this far. The danger will further escalate from this point onward, and you’ll only be a burden to me if I bring you with me. I am not a saint, and I have no intention of sacrificing myself for the rest of you. I’m planning to scout the path ahead and return to fetch you afterward, but I can’t guarantee that I’ll return for you,” Chu Feng said.

“Young master Chu Feng, we have already benefited greatly from tagging along with you. We’re grateful for what you have done for us. This is a token of goodwill from me. Please accept it,” Chu Shanshan said as she passed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

“Young master Chu Feng, this is a token of my goodwill too. Please accept it. Otherwise, I won’t be able to rest at ease.”

The others also offered their Cosmos Sacks to Chu Feng.

They understood where Chu Feng was coming from.

“I’ll accept your gifts then,” Chu Feng said as he accepted their Cosmos Sacks with a wave of his sleeves. He thought that he was qualified to receive these items from them for bringing them this far and sharing so many fruits with them.

“Let’s go. I’ll send you back,” Chu Feng said.

“We shan’t trouble young master Chu Feng any further. We’ll return by ourselves,” Chu Shanshan said.

“Those ferocious beasts may regrow,” Chu Feng said.

Those words silenced the crowd. Other than the white fruit monsters, the other colored fruit monsters would attack anyone who came within its line of sight. They would be doomed if a copper fruit monster were to attack them.

Chu Feng escorted the crowd back. Just as he had expected, some of the monsters he had slain along the way had regrown. It was fortunate he had offered to escort them, or else they would have a tough time returning safely. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Hm?” Chu Feng’s eyebrows suddenly shot up.

He spotted a person getting attacked by a golden fruit monster, and it was a familiar face.
