Chapter 3145 - A Tooth For A Tooth

“You actually concealed your cultivation?! You are truly despicable!” Suppressed on the ground, Qingyu Fengming gnashed his teeth furiously and let out an extremely unreconciled shout.

He felt that he had been utterly deceived by Chu Feng.

He felt that he was only careless, and ended up in this state because Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation.

He felt that the only reason why he would proclaim that he would take care of Chu Feng, only to end up being oppressed to the ground and unable to get up, was all because Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation.

At that moment, Qingyu Fengming felt that he had been completely disgraced. As for his disgrace, it was all caused by Chu Feng. As such, the hatred he felt for Chu Feng was truly bone-deep.

However, Qingyu Fengming had no idea that Chu Feng did not conceal his cultivation. Rather, Chu Feng had made two successive breakthroughs in cultivation in a short period of time.

Furthermore, the reason why Chu Feng was able to make such rapid progress in cultivation was all due to the Immortal Crystal Ore that their Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan was searching strenuously for.

That said, Chu Feng was disinclined to bother explaining things to them. There was also no reason for him to explain. After all, whatever they thought was not important. What was important was Chu Shuangshuang.

Thus, after Chu Feng suppressed Qingyu Fengming to the ground with his oppressive might, he leaned over and began to continue healing Chu Shuangshuang.

This scene completely baffled the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.

They did not understand why Chu Feng, after suppressing Qingyu Fengming, did not attack him, even though he was proclaiming that he would get revenge earlier.

Just like that, the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan looked on with puzzled expressions on their faces.

Even that rank nine Heavenly Immortal level Qingyu Dong did not attempt to rashly rescue Qingyu Fengming from Chu Feng.

Instead, he was waiting for Chu Feng. He wanted to know exactly what Chu Feng’s intention was.

Not long afterward, after being treated by Chu Feng, the expression of pain on the seriously injured Chu Shuangshuang started to ease. Her tightly closed eyes also opened once more.

“Stop, stop...”

“I truly did not do it on purpose, I truly did not intrude upon your territory on purpose. Please spare me, please spare me.”

However, after waking up, Chu Shuangshuang immediately revealed an expression of panic, and started to cry out in alarm. It would appear that she was truly frightened.

Seeing this, Chu Feng hurriedly hugged Chu Shuangshuang and began to imbue her body with gentle power to calm her mind.

“Big sis Shuangshuang, don’t be afraid. It’s alright now. It’s fine now,” Chu Feng comforted Chu Shuangshuang as he imbued his gentle spirit power into her.

“Little brother Chu Feng, it’s you... you’re the one who saved me?” After Chu Shuangshuang’s state of mind eased a bit, she finally noticed that the one that was tightly hugging her was Chu Feng; that she was safe.

After verifying that it was Chu Feng, Chu Shuangshuang’s emotions once again went out of control. With a loud ‘waa,’ she started crying, and began to dig her head into Chu Feng’s bosom whilst grabbing his clothes tightly, seemingly extremely afraid of ending up in the hands of the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan again.

Seeing Chu Shuangshuang acting like that, Chu Feng felt even greater pain.

Although Chu Feng had not known Chu Shuangshuang for long, through the interactions that he had had with her, he knew that she was neither weak or pretentious.

The reason why she was acting in such a manner at that moment, was because she was truly wronged, so much so that if Chu Feng had come any later, she might’ve truly have gone insane.

For an ordinary person to be tortured to a state of insanity, they must have undergone inhuman mistreatment.

Cultivators, especially one of Chu Shuangshuang’s cultivation, had very powerful endurance.

To be able to torment someone of Chu Shuangshuang’s cultivation to a state of insanity, how cruel must the torture have been?

“Big sis Shuangshuang, don’t cry anymore. Crying does not do anything. In this world, your enemies will not feel pity for you just because you’ve shed tears,” as Chu Feng spoke, he stood up. Then, he helped Chu Shuangshuang on her feet too.

“Big sis Shuangshuang, apart from him, who else present attacked you?” Chu Feng pointed to Qingyu Fengming, who was lying on the ground.

“He’s the only one,” Chu Shuangshuang spoke those words subconsciously. Immediately after she said those words, she realized that something was going on.

Her eyes opened wide. She looked to Chu Feng and asked, “Little brother Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?”

“I am going to return a tooth for a tooth,” as Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve. Immediately, a large amount of martial power gushed forth from his cuff like starlight.

That scene was very beautiful. However, that beautiful scene only lasted for a split second before changing completely.

The reason for that was because when that bright martial power landed, it began to splatter like water.

As the martial power splattered, it turned into countless black bugs.

Those black bugs were only the size of fingernails. However, they were completely covered in spikes that resembled sawteeth. They looked very frightening and disgusting.

Those bugs were growing more and more numerous. In the blink of an eye, there were thousands upon thousands of them. Closely packed, and in successive waves, they began to move toward Qingyu Fengming.

Seeing the incoming bugs, Qingyu Fengming’s face immediately turned green with fear.

He knew that if those bugs were to reach him, he would definitely suffer miserably.

“Young master Chu Feng, please stop!”

At that moment, Qingyu Dong, who had been quiet the entire time finally spoke. Not only did he speak to stop Chu Feng, he also took out an Incomplete Immortal Armament as he spoke. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In the end, he was someone from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. He would not look on with folded arms as Chu Feng tortured Qingyu Fengming.

“Big brother Qingyu Dong, quickly teach that Chu Feng a lesson for me! Help me take care of that despicable bastard!” Qingyu Fengming shouted. He was no longer cursing out Qingyu Dong. Instead, he shouted with a pleading tone. He wanted Qingyu Dong to save him.
