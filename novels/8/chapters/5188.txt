Chapter 5188: Monopolizing the Treasure

“Elder, it’s my belief that a person ought to hold to their promises. I can’t say that I’m on close terms with that cat, but I have already promised it to investigate the gaseous flame together. As long as it doesn’t betray me, I won’t turn my back on it,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young brother, I didn’t think that you would be such a principled man despite your young age. Your parents must be noble personages too for them to raise an outstanding child like you,” Tao Wu replied via voice transmission.

He then switched to speaking aloud, allowing both Old Cat and Chu Feng to hear him.

“Young brother, may I know how I should address you?”

“I am Chu Feng,” Chu Feng replied.

“Chu Feng. What a wonderful name,” Tao Wu remarked.

He turned to look at Old Cat right after.

“You can call me Lord Ti…”

Tao Wu interjected before Old Cat could finish his self-introduction, “I’ll call you Old Kitty. I was considering Little Kitty, but you look a little too old for that. I’d be disrespecting all of the little kitties out there in the world if I called you that.”

“The hell…”

Old Cat rolled its eyes.

Following that, Tao Wu started chatting leisurely with Chu Feng in the open, though most of their conversation was limited to pleasantries. Old Cat couldn’t stand the sight of them getting chummy with each other.

“Chu Feng, be careful of that old thing. There’s something off about him,” Old Cat warned Chu Feng via voice transmission.

“He does look weird,” Chu Feng replied.

“I’m not just talking about his appearance. Didn’t you hear him mention earlier that he’s from Pilgrimage Galaxy?” Old Cat pointed out.

“I did, but he explained right after that he only calls the Seven Realms Galaxy as such because it feels like a pilgrimage to him. It’s just a slip of the tongue,” Chu Feng replied.

“Bullshit!! Are you really listening to the nonsense spouted by that old thing?

“I’ll tell you this. The Seven Realms Galaxy is only called as such after it was united by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Before that, it was called the Third Galaxy because it was ranked third amongst the galaxies.

“However, there was a period of time where multiple stone tablets from the Ancient Era surfaced in the Seven Realms Galaxy. These stone tablets revealed the original name of the Seven Realms Galaxy back in the Ancient Era, and it was none other than Pilgrimage Galaxy!” Old Cat said.

“Doesn’t that mean that the Pilgrimage Galaxy is indeed the Seven Realms Galaxy? I don’t see any problem with that,” Chu Feng replied.

He would be a fool if he really hadn’t noticed that something was amiss here. He was only trying to probe Old Cat here to see what it thought about the situation. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“There’s definitely a problem here! Not many people in the current era know that the Seven Realms Galaxy used to be the Pilgrimage Galaxy, and those who know of it would be more used to calling it the Seven Realms Galaxy. You would never hear a cultivator of our era mistakenly referring to the Seven Realms Galaxy as the Pilgrimage Galaxy, be it a slip of the tongue or not,” Old Cat exclaimed.

“Are you suggesting that Tao Wu is from the Ancient Era?” Chu Feng asked.

“Who knows? I don’t sense the aura of the Ancient Era from him, but a world spiritist of his caliber can easily conceal that. Even if he is a cultivator of our era, there’s no denying that there’s something fishy about him. In any case, you should tread carefully. Don’t get too close to him. Don’t blindly trust anything he says. Make sure to stay vigilant,” Old Cat said.

“Got it,” Chu Feng replied.

The closer the three of them got to the source of the gaseous flame, the more they realized just how humongous the amount of gaseous flame gushing out of the ground was. Even monstrous beasts that were hundreds of meters in height would appear insignificant in comparison to it.

They encountered many other people along the way, most of them being native cultivators of the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. They were also drawn to the gaseous flame as well. However, due to their limited cultivation, Chu Feng and the others were able to overtake them in the blink of an eye.

All of a sudden, they noticed a flying warship in front of them. It was traveling at a speed much slower than theirs, but it wasn’t an entity that they could overtake within the blink of an eye anymore. Judging from its speed, the one driving it had to be at least a rank three Half-God level cultivator.

That being said, it didn’t take long for Chu Feng and the others to catch up with it.

Now that they were closer to it, they could see just how huge the flying warship was. There were so many palaces inside it that it was reminiscent of a mobile city. A cultivator standing beside it would look no different from a mere ant.

Nevertheless, this flying warship still looked insignificant before the gaseous flame.

Chu Feng’s face turned cold upon seeing the flag flown by the flying warship. It belonged to a power that he hated with a passion—the Situ World Spiritist Clan!

“The Situ World Spiritist Clan? Is it a power native to this Ordinary Realm? They sure know how to put on airs.”

Tao Wu also glanced at the warship while passing by it.

“What are you thinking of? The Situ World Spiritist Clan are the overlords of this starfield! I heard rumors that the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen have been keeping a close eye on the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm, even stationing experts here. Still, I didn’t expect them to send down Situ Hongbo, one of their grand elders. They must be aware of the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm’s secret, or else they wouldn’t have paid so much attention to this palace,” Old Cat remarked.

The central palace of the warship had been sealed off by a barrier, but Old Cat was still able to easily tell who was the one driving it through his unique observation means.

“A grand elder of a starfield’s overlord is only at rank three Half-God level? That’s too weak!” Tao Wu exclaimed.

“Hmph. Are you going to tell us that the starfield overlords of your Seven Realms Galaxy are all at peak Half-God level? Stop joking. There isn’t even that big of a difference between our Totem Galaxy and your Seven Realms Galaxy,” Old Cat argued

It was feeling indignant as a native of the Totem Galaxy.

“It’s still stronger than Totem Galaxy,” Tao Wu replied.

Weng!

All of a sudden, a divine light started pouring down from the very top of the gaseous flame, looking almost as if divine treasures were falling from heaven.

“This is bad!”

Upon seeing that sight, Tao Wu got anxious and sped up. Old Cat stopped running its mouth. Chu Feng’s complexion turned grave.

All of them could tell that the divine light was an extremely powerful barrier. A powerful world spiritist was constructing the barrier to keep others from reaching the gaseous flame.

Despite Chu Feng and the others rushing forward, the barrier formed a speed so fast that it covered the humongous pillar of gaseous flame before they could come close.

Standing before the barrier, Chu Feng could sense just how terrifying it was. It was far beyond his means to decipher. The same went for Tao Wu and Old Cat too.

“Goddamnit! There’s actually an Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist hiding in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm! Just what in the world is hidden in this realm that an expert of that caliber is actually willing to camp out in this remote place?

“That stingy bastard! The least he can do is to share a slice of the pie with us! How shameless must that Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist be to monopolize the treasure by himself?” Old Cat berated.
