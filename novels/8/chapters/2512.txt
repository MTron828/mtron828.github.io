Chapter 2512 - Ruthlessness

“Chu Feng’s cultivation has actually reached this level?”

The crowd was extremely astonished. Although Chu Feng only managed to possess the strength to suppress Dugu Jianxu after utilizing his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, the crowd was able to tell with a single glance that Chu Feng’s actual cultivation had reached the same level as Dugu Jianxu, that he was a rank eight Martial Ancestor.

However, Chu Feng was clearly only a Half Martial Ancestor when he had disappeared two years ago. Yet, in merely two years, his cultivation actually increased to such a level. This level of progress was simply incredible.

“Chu Feng, you... you... what are you planning to do?”

“If you are to cripple my cultivation, my Immortal Sword School will definitely not let you get away with it.”

At that moment, Dugu Jianxu started to panic. After all, Chu Feng’s hand had already pierced into his dantian, and he could completely destroy his cultivation at any moment.

At that moment, it was as if Chu Feng had captured his lifeline. As such, he had no choice but to be afraid. After all, that was the cultivation that he had trained many years to obtain.

“Did you think that I, Chu Feng, am someone who is scared of your Immortal Sword School?” Chu Feng looked at Dugu Jianxu with an extremely mocking gaze.

Seeing that gaze, Dugu Jianxu’s heart tightened. He suddenly realized how foolish he was.

Chu Feng did not even fear the Kong Heavenly Clan. Naturally, he would also not fear his Immortal Sword School. Thus, it was truly ridiculous for him to try to threaten Chu Feng with his power.

“Chu Feng, there are neither grievances nor hatred between us. As for my earlier attack, I had merely made it so with the intention of swapping pointers with you,” Seeing that threatening Chu Feng was useless, Dugu Jianxu began to utilize soft words.

“Before today, there were indeed no grievances nor hatred between us. Never have I thought of making you my enemy or taking your life.”

“However, when you attacked me earlier, you did not start off with a lenient attack. Instead, you wanted to take my life from the very beginning.”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that I am stronger than you, my life would’ve already been lost,” Chu Feng said those words one at a time with an extremely cold tone.

Seeing that Chu Feng was determined to kill, Dugu Jianxu started to shiver in fear. He who used to be filled with arrogance had no choice but to lower himself. He hurriedly begged, “Chu Feng, I...”

However, right after he opened his mouth, ruthlessness emerged in Chu Feng’s eyes, “Towards people like you, I, Chu Feng, am never one to be lenient.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng’s hand that was pierced into Dugu Jianxu’s dantian suddenly trembled. Then, a ‘bang’ was heard.

Dugu Jianxu’s dantian has been completely destroyed by Chu Feng.

After Chu Feng finished doing that, he pulled his arm back.

“No!!!!”

Dugu Jianxu let out a hysterical scream. Then, he waved his fists toward Chu Feng.

Chu Feng moved slightly to the side, and Dugu Jianxu’s fists landed in air.

Dugu Jianxu was no match for Chu Feng back when he had had cultivation. Now that his martial cultivation was crippled by Chu Feng, how could he possibly be a match for him?

At that moment, Dugu Jianxu felt that the great majority of his cultivation had already escaped him. In utter despair, he half knelt in midair with a ‘putt.’

Dugu Jianxu was still able to fly by relying on the remaining power within him. However, he would never again be the same Dugu Jianxu, no longer would he be a rank eight Martial Ancestor.

“I am already showing you mercy by sparing your life,” Chu Feng looked at Dugu Jianxu without the slightest bit of sympathy.

The reason for that was because he knew very well that if it wasn’t for the fact that he was stronger than Dugu Jianxu, he would’ve already died by Dugu Jianxu’s hands. There was no reason for Chu Feng to sympathize with someone like him.

“It’s your turn now,” Chu Feng cast his gaze to the Wine-Meat Monk.

At that moment, the Wine-Meat Monk smiled wryly. He hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Brother Chu Feng, I was merely joking around earlier. You must not take my joke seriously.”

The Wine-Meat Monk was truly scared. Even Dugu Jianxu was so easily defeated by Chu Feng. Thus, he knew that he would not be a match for Chu Feng.

After all, Chu Feng had revealed his strength. He possessed the cultivation of a rank eight Martial Ancestor and possessed the Heavenly Bloodline’s power of Thunder Armor, Thunder Wings and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.

As such, Chu Feng was naturally not an opponent that he, an ordinary peak Martial Ancestor, could match.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s figure shifted, and he disappeared.

When he reappeared, he arrived beside the Wine-Meat Monk.

“You!!!”

At that moment, the Wine-Meat Monk’s expression changed enormously. He was able to feel clear pain in his dantian.

Upon looking, it was not only the Wine-Meat Monk who was shocked, but the surrounding crowd was also shocked. Chu Feng had pierced the same hand he had pierced into Dugu Jianxu’s dantian earlier into the Wine-Meat Monk’s dantian.

How could that be considered to be a hand? It was simply a sharp blade capable of penetrating everything. Even though the Wine-Meat Monk was a rank nine Martial Ancestor, he was still unable to contend against Chu Feng’s hand.

“Ahhh!!!”

The Wine-Meat Monk suddenly let out a miserable scream.

He ended up suffering the same fate as Dugu Jianxu. His dantian was destroyed by Chu Feng, and he could only continue to fly in the sky by relying on the remaining power within him.

“I did not attack you, why did you cripple my cultivation?!” The Wine-Meat Monk shouted angrily.

“For scum like you, I am already being lenient by only crippling your cultivation,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he looked to Zhou Fukong, “It’s your turn now.”

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re being too excessive here, no? At the very least, the two of them were fighting with one another to take care of you. Thus, it could be understandable for you to cripple their cultivations.”

“However, I have never done anything to you,” Zhou Fukong said with an innocent expression.

“Where did the poisonous bugs on Zhao Hong’s body come from?” Chu Feng asked.

Hearing those words, Zhou Fukong’s expression changed. He knew that he would not be able to dodge a battle today.

However, after verifying that Chu Feng was determined to fight him, he was not terrified, and instead sneered.

“Chu Feng, while they are afraid of you, I am not,” After Zhou Fukong finished saying those words, a buzzing sound was heard as his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared on him.

As his cultivation was that of a rank nine Martial Ancestor to begin with, after he activated his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, his aura actually surpassed Chu Feng’s.

Right at that moment, Kong Doumoyuan suddenly said, “Brother Zhou, I should be the one to take care of this Chu Feng.”

“Very well,” The lightning in Zhou Fukong’s eyes gradually vanished. His Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings disappeared, and he also moved back.

Upon seeing this, the others present also moved back. They all knew that a great battle between Chu Feng and Kong Doumoyuan was about to occur.

As both of them possessed extraordinary strength, they did not wish to be implicated by it.

“Chu Feng, you dared to injure my brothers in my territory. You are simply not placing me in your eyes,” Kong Doumoyuan said to Chu Feng.

“Heh...” Chu Feng laughed mockingly.

“What are you laughing about?” Kong Doumoyuan asked.

“It’s one thing for Dugu Jianxu, but do you dare tell me that you were unable to save that monk?”

“You could have saved them, yet you didn’t. And here you still have the nerve to address them as brothers?” Chu Feng said coldly.

“That’s true. With Kong Doumoyuan’s ability, he should’ve been able to save them.”

After hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd started to spiritedly discuss the matter. In fact, Dugu Jianxu and the Wine-Meat Monk even started to look at Kong Doumoyuan with resentful gazes.

“Kong Doumoyuan, we have considered you our brother, yet you actually exploited us!” The Wine-Meat Monk spoke furiously.

That’s right, he had exploited them.

Regardless of whether or not Chu Feng lived or died today, as long as he crippled Dugu Jianxu and the Wine-Meat Monk’s cultivations, he would’ve made enemies of the Immortal Sword School and the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple.

The people present were all intelligent individuals. Thus, they all knew why Kong Doumoyuan did not save his so-called brothers.

Being blamed by Dugu Jianxu and the Wine-Meat Monk, Kong Doumoyuan did not bother to even look at them.

It was as if Dugu Jianxu and the Wine-Meat Monk were simply unable to enter his discerning eye at all. At that moment, Kong Doumoyuan’s gaze was completely focused on Chu Feng. He said, “You are the ruthless and vicious one. You were the one to harm others, yet you’re actually trying to disgrace me? Chu Feng, today... no matter what, I will not spare you.”

“You’re speaking as if you were definitely going to spare me if I didn’t do these things today,” Chu Feng smiled with contempt.

“That’s true. We cannot coexist. There is no reason for me to spare you. However, I, Kong Doumoyuan, have never been one to bully the weak.”

“Since we are going to battle today, I will not defeat you by relying on my superior cultivation. Today... I will battle you with the same battle power.”

After Kong Doumoyuan finished saying those words, his Thunder Armor appeared on his body. Instantly... his cultivation surpassed that of ordinary peak Martial Ancestors.

Although he was unable to reach the True Immortal realm, his current battle power was on par with Chu Feng.

And that was when he was not using his Thunder Wings.

“Only the Thunder Armor and not the Thunder Wings? Are you certain that you want to fight me like this?” Chu Feng asked.

“I always keep my words,” Kong Doumoyuan said.

“Then you will definitely regret it,” Chu Feng said.

“What arrogance!” Kong Doumoyuan shouted. Then, he revealed an Ancestral Armament spear and charged forth toward Chu Feng.

“Humph,” Chu Feng snorted. The Stormwind Edge was already in his hand. He also charged forth to confront Kong Doumoyuan. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
