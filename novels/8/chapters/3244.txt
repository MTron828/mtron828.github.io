Chapter 3244 - Ashen

As Linghu Mingye kneeled on the ground, he was first completely bewildered. Following that, anger filled his face.

“Chu Feng, I’ll kill you!!!” Linghu Mingye roared with incomparable anger.

Linghu Mingye had always been an arrogant and conceited individual who considered himself unexcelled in the world. He was someone who stood high and above.

However, he was now actually kneeling before a Chu Heavenly Clansman. This was extremely painful for Linghu Mingye. He felt as if he had received an enormous humiliation. Because of that, Linghu Mingye became incomparably furious.

“You wish to kill me?” Chu Feng smiled lightly at Linghu Mingye’s threat. He said, “Could it be that you still don’t understand the circumstances you’re in right now?”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he lightly pointed his finger downward. Softly, he said, “Lie on your stomach.”

After those words were said, Linghu Mingye actually really ended up lying before Chu Feng’s feet.

He was unable to move at all, and completely powerless to resist.

At that moment, he was truly under Chu Feng’s complete control.

“Insolent bastard! You damned insolent bastard! You dare to treat me like this?!!!” Linghu Mingye’s roars continued to echo.

Linghu Mingye’s anger filled the surrounding air.

However, Chu Feng was still completely unmoved. Calmly, he said, “Linghu Mingye, it seems that you don’t understand that martial cultivators speak with their strength, and not by shouting insults and curses.”

“Strength? Someone like you dares to speak of strength?! You, a mere Heavenly Immortal, dare to speak about strength to me, a Martial Immortal?!”

“If you have the capability, why don’t you remove the treasure on your body and use your own power to fight me?!” Linghu Mingye snarled. Even though he was suppressed by Chu Feng, he still refused to recognize his strength.

“My own power?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I, Chu Feng, have gained control of this Holy Spirit Formation of Light with my ability. Is that not my power?” Chu Feng asked.

“Gained control of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light? Bullshit! Did you really think that I would believe that sort of nonsense just because you’ve managed to suppress me?” Linghu Mingye sneered.

From the bottom of his heart, Linghu Mingye did not believe that Chu Feng was able to gain control of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

From Linghu Mingye’s gaze, Chu Feng noticed what he was thinking.

Chu Feng felt that Linghu Mingye was someone with an extremely strong ego.

Chu Feng’s suppression of Linghu Mingye had already damaged Linghu Mingye’s ego. However, this only caused Linghu Mingye to feel even more furious.

Linghu Mingye was determined that Chu Feng was only able to suppress him through the use of some treasure. He was determined that Chu Feng did not possess true capabilities.

Thus, he was feeling unreconciled. That was the reason why he was so unwilling to accept his defeat, and became so angry.

That said, if Chu Feng were to make Linghu Mingye realize that he truly controlled the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, the damage to Linghu Mingye’s ego would be even stronger.

That sort of damage would be much more painful than physical pain.

Thus, Chu Feng, who was originally not planning to prove too much to Linghu Mingye, decided to change his plan.

Chu Feng was determined to have Linghu Mingye realize that he was the one in control of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

“Linghu Mingye, since you understand this Holy Spirit Formation of Light so well, I’m sure you should know that the Holy Spirit Formation of Light’s three phases are irreversible, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Naturally,” Linghu Mingye replied.

“Woosh~~~”

After Linghu Mingye said those words, not only did he get back up from lying on the ground, but he also started floating in midair.

Linghu Mingye thought that Chu Feng was going to humiliate him. Immediately, he shouted, “What are you planning to do?!”

“I want you to carefully witness the change to this Holy Spirit Formation of Light,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he waved his sleeve.

In the next moment, the surface area of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light began to rapidly expand.

In the blink of an eye, the shrunken Holy Spirit Formation of Light returned to its original boundless size.

“This...”

Seeing that, Linghu Mingye’s expression changed as disbelief filled his eyes.

“You’re already surprised? Don’t be so anxious to be surprised just yet,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he waved his sleeve again.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

In the next moment, countless bodies of light began flying over from all directions. In the end, they all entered Chu Feng’s body.

Those were no ordinary bodies of light. Instead, they were all Ores of Light.

Chu Qing, Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu had all formed very powerful Symbols of Light.

However, when they decided to leave the Holy Spirit Formation of Light of their own accord, when they decided to leave the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, their Symbols of Light did not leave the Holy Spirit Formation of Light with them.

Instead, they disappeared the moment they left, and then returned to the mines that they were originally located in.

And now, all of those Ores of Light in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light seemed to have been summoned, and were all flying toward Chu Feng and assimilating into his body.

At that moment, the Symbol of Light on Chu Feng’s forehead became very bright. It was simply as bright as the sun itself.

One could very well imagine how enormous the power gathered in that Symbol of Light was.

Chu Feng felt that, with the power of his Symbol of Light, even reaching the Martial Immortal Realm, that difficult to reach level of cultivation, would be a certainty.

“You... you...”

“This is impossible, impossible!”

“Exactly what did you do?! What sort of trick did you use?!”

Linghu Mingye had an expression of disbelief on his face As matters stood, he had realized that Chu Feng might have really gained control over the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to do whatever he wanted.

However, Linghu Mingye was unwilling to believe this to be real.

“Don’t speak. Look on quietly.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he sat down cross-legged.

“Rumble~~~”

The next moment, rolling thunder began to be heard from the sky even though there was no lightning present. The thunder soon covered the entire vast and boundless Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

Following that, golden light emerged. The golden light connected heaven and earth. It was not only the sky that was shining brightly, even the grass, the trees and every other substance on the earth were all shining with that same sort of golden light. It was as if heaven and earth had fused together.

“Assimilation phase. This is the assimilation phase.”

At that moment, Linghu Mingye had an ashen expression.

The reason for that was because, according to his knowledge of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, it would be impossible for the Holy Spirit Formation of Light to enter the assimilation phase in such conditions. Only after the surface area of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light had shrunk would it be able to enter the assimilation phase.

However, the assimilation phase that shouldn’t occur whilst the surface area of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light was still so boundlessly vast was actually happening.

At that moment, Linghu Mingye was well-aware as to exactly how this came about.

It was Chu Feng. All of this was done by Chu Feng.
