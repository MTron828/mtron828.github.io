Chapter 4944: The Situ World Spiritist Clan

“What’s the Zhuge Clan up to? Are they gathering their soldiers to hunt us down?” Shengguang Baimei sneered.

He could tell that the Zhuge Clan’s current plight had nothing to do with them, but he was more than happy to see them in a crisis. After how the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief had insulted them, he would love more than anything for someone to teach them a lesson.

“Judging from their reaction, it looked like they are in a dire situation. Did they meet with trouble after we left? Master Yin Ren, does the Zhuge Clan have any nemesis?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ve never heard of the Zhuge Clan having any nemesis before. I guess the Gongsun Clan could count as one, but they have already been massacred,” Master Yin Ren said.

“Isn’t this simple? We just have to capture one guy and question him,” Shengguang Baimei said.

“Lord Baimei, let’s not alarm them. Their conflict has nothing to do with us anyway. Don’t forget our primary goal here. This might just be a good opportunity for us.”

Master Yin Ren wanted them to take this opportunity of this chaos to infiltrate the legacy formation.

“Come with me, we’ll head straight to the legacy formation.”

Master Yin Ren led the way forward.

They encountered quite a few barriers along the way, but Master Yin Ren was already prepared for them. There was not a single barrier that could hope to block his way. On top of that, he seemed to know his way around, moving from one place to the other without the slightest hesitation.&nbsp;

Under his lead, Chu Feng and the others finally found themselves coming face to face with the legacy formation. It was just different from what Chu Feng had expected.

First and foremost, the spirit formation gate looked ordinary. It was hard to imagine that it was led to some kind of amazing place.&nbsp;

On top of that, the spirit formation gate was erected on top of an ordinary tombstone that could have been any random individual’s grave. Such a plain-looking grave shouldn’t have appeared in the midst of the powerful Zhuge Clan.

It simply didn’t fit the airs of a powerful clan.&nbsp;

However, if one were to read the name on the grave, one would understand why the spirit formation gate was erected on top of it.

Grave of Situ Qi!

But Chu Feng merely glanced at the legacy formation before moving his gaze away. There were many other figures standing in the vicinity, seemingly guarding the area. It would be hard for them to enter the legacy formation under their watch.&nbsp;

It felt like something was amiss.

The elites of the Zhuge Clan were all gathered here, be it the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, the elders, or Zhuge Feiluan. It was an impressive army, but they were all standing at attention. Fear could be seen in many of their eyes, especially amongst the juniors.&nbsp;

Their fear stemmed from the enemies standing opposite to them.&nbsp;

The enemies numbered far less than them, sitting at only 31 people. These 31 people wore blue cloaks and blue coronets, and one of them was a junior.&nbsp;

The junior looked ordinary, but he stood with a haughty attitude as if he was a god before mere mortals. Even the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief wasn’t worthy of his attention.&nbsp;

His condescending attitude contrasted with Zhuge Feiluan’s gracious posture.&nbsp;

The other blue-cloaked individuals were mostly old monsters who had lived for at least ten thousand years. Standing at the forefront of the group was a woman with a seductive figure.&nbsp;

This woman was likely to have lived several thousand years, but she had a young and elegant appearance. Her black eyes were particularly magnetic, drawing people in. There was a white kitten lying in her embrace.&nbsp;

The kitten looked obedient, but Chu Feng was able to notice its peculiarities right away.&nbsp;

These blue-cloaked individuals wore an identical token on their waist which had five words inscribed on them—Situ World Spiritist Clan.&nbsp;

“Situ World Spiritist Clan? Are they related to Situ Qi?” Princess Xiaoxiao asked Master Yin Ren.

The one who was likely to understand the current situation amongst them was Master Yin Ren.

“Shush, don’t speak a word for now. Let’s watch the situation first,” Master Yin Ren sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng and the others.&nbsp;

“Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, you’re finally willing to meet me. It looks like you have gathered every last bit of force you have here. Are you intending to stand against us?”&nbsp;

The blue-cloaked woman nonchalantly studied her own fingernails as she spoke. She didn’t even bother to properly look at the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief. Her attitude and tone showed utmost disdain.

“Milord, you’re mistaken. How could we possibly dare to oppose you? It’s just that you have injured several members of our Zhuge Clan earlier on, so it’s inevitable that we would feel a little nervous about standing in your presence.&nbsp;

“Since you’re from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, it naturally means that we aren’t enemies. May I know what brings you to our Zhuge Clan today?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief spoke with a courteous attitude.

Despite his attempt to maintain his composure, one could still sense his fear.&nbsp;

“Since you know that we’re from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, shouldn’t you know the reason why we’re here today? Naturally, we’re here to collect what Situ Qi has left here,” the blue-cloaked woman said.&nbsp;

“Milord, are you intending to take the legacy formation Lord Situ Qi has left here?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Situ Qi might have willingly left this legacy formation in your Zhuge Clan, but he’s a member of our Situ World Spiritist Clan. Needless to say, our clan has the right to collect anything he has left behind.&nbsp;

“Situ Qi has made great contributions to our clan in his lifetime, so we intend to respect his will. However, that’s only if you’re qualified for it.”

Weng!

The blue-cloaked woman suddenly tossed the white kitten in her arm into the sky.

Peng!

The white kitten exploded in mid-air before releasing a white aura and swiftly dissipated in all directions. It swiftly morphed into a humongous palace spanning an area of over a hundred thousand meters squared above the Zhuge Clan.&nbsp;

Just as Chu Feng had expected, the white kitten wasn’t a true living being but a world spiritist treasure.&nbsp;

The transparent palace walls allowed one to see everything within the palace, including a red plaque bearing the words ‘Junior World Spiritist Combat Hall’.

“The legacy formation is something Situ Qi has left for his juniors.&nbsp;

“So, we’ll have a junior of your Zhuge Clan to spar with our Situ World Spiritist Clan’s junior. If your junior wins the battle, it would mean that you’re qualified to keep Situ Qi’s legacy. Naturally, we’ll allow you to keep his legacy formation. On the other hand, if you lose the fight, it would mean that you’re unqualified. If so, we’ll be taking the legacy formation back with us.”

The blue-cloaked woman glanced at the junior behind her, and the junior immediately stepped forward.&nbsp;

“Situ Gouyue. Please go easy on me.”

Despite the junior’s courteous words, his tone and attitude spoke a different story. He released his spirit power as he spoke, revealing a might comparable to that of rank five Martial Exalted level cultivators.&nbsp; Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Those from the Zhuge Clan revealed distressed looks upon sensing his aura. Chu Feng and the others were surprised as well.

That would mean that the junior was at rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation. Given that Zhuge Feiluan was only at rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation, how could he possibly be a match?

There was no need to hold this duel. The Zhuge Clan didn’t stand a chance at all.&nbsp;
