Chapter 4703: Song Xi’s Experiences

“Song Xi?”

There was no way Chu Feng wouldn’t recognize Song Xi. He was someone Chu Feng met right after he ascended from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Back then, Song Xi’s talents were average, but as he had an appearance resembling Jiang Wushang and a good character, Chu Feng felt a sense of intimacy with him, so they eventually became friends.

Soon afterward, he came to learn that Song Xi actually had a special background.

Later on, a series of coincidences led to Song Xi accepting the inheritance of the Ten Thousand Poisons Demon Sect. However, the inheritance was extremely dangerous, and accepting it could lead to two vastly different outcomes. Things could either go smoothly and he would simply gain greater power, or his cultivation would go berserk, and he would become a slaughtering monster.

When Chu Feng finally reached the place where Song Xi had accepted the inheritance, he was already nowhere to be seen.

Following that incident, Chu Feng continued to grow bigger and bigger in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but he was unable to find Song Xi anywhere. Little did he know that he would actually meet Song Xi at the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and the other party would actually be the strongest disciple of the North Tortoise Hall.

Based on the aura Song Xi was emanating, it would appear that he was at rank four Utmost Exalted level. With his level of cultivation, he could definitely be considered a formidable figure back at the Ancestral Martial Starfield, let alone the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

While Chu Feng did think that Song Xi would undergo some changes from accepting the inheritance, he never thought that he would grow by so much.

One must know that Song Xi was no more than a small cultivator in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm back then, hardly worthy of notice at all. The prodigies there were people whom Song Xi could only look up to but never hope to reach. But in a turn of fate, he had become someone whom those prodigies would have to look up to now.

However, Chu Feng couldn’t help but harbor some doubts about this.

The person before him neither had the appearance nor the voice of Song Xi, and his aura was vastly different from before too. But for some inexplicable reason, from the moment the person identified himself as Song Xi, Chu Feng’s instincts told him that he was telling the truth.

“Are you really Song Xi?”

Nevertheless, his logical mind was still having difficulties coming to terms with it.

“It’s me, Chu Feng. Do you not recognize me anymore? I guess look very different from how I used to be, don’t I? I went through some encounters that led to my appearance, my aura, and even my voice changing greatly. However, I really am Song Xi. I can prove my identity.”

Song Xi quickly shared with Chu Feng some of the experiences they had together through voice transmission, leaving Chu Feng with no choice but to believe him. Those were indeed experiences that only he and Song Xi would know about.

“Just what have you gone through? What caused such a huge change in you?”

However, the knowledge that the person before him was truly Song Xi didn’t make him feel any better. Instead, he felt his heart aching a little for him.

Just looking at the other party’s appearance was enough to hint at the difficulties he had to overcome along the way.

“I’ll tell you about it later. Come, let me introduce you to my brothers!”

Song Xi began to introduce to Chu Feng the people standing behind him. They were all the most outstanding disciples in the current generation of the North Tortoise Hall. However, Chu Feng wasn’t too interested in them, so he didn’t pay it too much heed.

When Song Xi introduced one of the female disciples, Chu Feng sharply noticed that there was something amiss about her.

This female disciple had a seductively curvaceous figure, but she wasn’t the type Chu Feng liked. Nevertheless, Chu Feng had to admit that she was the type that could enchant most men.

Despite how attractive she was, there was hardly anyone present who dared to direct a glance at her. It was not that they didn’t want to but they dared not to.

There was only one other person aside from Chu Feng who dared to look at her directly, and that person was Song Xi. On top of that, when the two of them met each other’s eyes, Chu Feng could tell that there was something peculiar in their gazes.

Without a doubt, there had a special relationship with one another.

“Chu Feng, let me introduce a very important person to you. She is Wang Ziyan, the number one beauty of our North Tortoise Hall. How is it? She’s much prettier than the Starfall Holy Land’s Xia Yun’er, right?”

Song Xi wrapped his hands around the female disciple’s waist and pulled her into his embrace. There was a gleeful look on his face that looked almost as if he was showing off his own possession.

The female disciple named Wang Ziyan also didn’t struggle against Song Xi, choosing to lie on Song Xi’s chest coyly instead.

This was more than enough to verify Chu Feng’s suspicions that they were a couple.

“On top of being the number one beauty of the North Tortoise Hall, she’s my sister-in-law too, am I right?” Chu Feng looked at Wang Ziyan as he asked.

“Of course,” Song Xi replied smugly.

“Chu Feng pays respects to sister-in-law,” Chu Feng bowed slightly to greet Wang Ziyan.

“Alright, the rest of you should return for now. I want to have some time with Brother Chu Feng to catch up with one another.”

After introducing one another, Song Xi placed his arms around Chu Feng, and the two of them entered Chu Feng’s residence together.

“Chu Feng, I didn’t expect that you would grow this quickly. You’re already at rank one Utmost Exalted level! With your cultivation, you should be able to reign supreme even in the Ancestral Martial Starfield!

“While I knew that you were no ordinary cultivator, to be honest, I thought that you would only be able to make a name for yourself in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm at the very most. It’s beyond my imagination to see you grow to such great heights!”

Song Xi was overjoyed to be able to see Chu Feng once more.

“You also grew quickly as well,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Me? I went through a lot of suffering in order to reach my current level. But it looks like heaven has taken pity on me after all. At least my days of suffering haven’t been in vain,” Song Xi said with a deep sigh.

“Song Xi, what happened to you back then? I searched all around for you in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but I couldn’t find you anywhere,” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s only natural that you wouldn’t be able to find me. I got taken away right after I received that elder’s inheritance,” Song Xi replied.

After that, he moved on to tell Chu Feng what he went through.

Even though Song Xi had obtained the inheritance, his heart was already seeded with an inner demon. He tried his best to curb his inner demon, for he knew if he succumbed to it, he would turn into a true demon of slaughter.

However, he simply wasn’t strong enough to fully curb his inner demon, resulting in him being unable to conceal his strength. As a result, he got found by a mysterious organization and was forced to serve them.

During one of the missions, they entered an Ancient Era’s remnant, where they found their way blocked by a lake. There was a restriction that prevented them from flying across the lake, so they had to swim through it. However, the lake was filled with terrifying toxins from the Ancient Era.

In order to test if the lake was safe or not, they forcefully pushed Song Xi into the lake, causing the toxins to swiftly corrode his body. His face was disfigured, and he swiftly sunk into the depths of the lake. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Thinking that Song Xi had died, those from the organization quickly left the area.

Unexpectedly, this tragedy was a blessing in disguise for Song Xi. He obtained greater power as a result of the trial, and he managed to break free of the organization’s control too.

He wanted to return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm afterward, but shortly after he went back there, he was found by one of the outer elders of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and was brought here.

“So, the changes in your aura and appearances were due to that toxin?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yeah, but things turned out fine in the end. If I hadn’t been thrown in there, I wouldn’t have reached my current level of accomplishment either,” Song Xi replied.

“Those people sure are vicious. Do you know the identity of that organization you were in?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why? Are you intending to exact vengeance for me?” Song Xi asked with a smile.

“You’re my brother. Your problem is my problem too. Even though things turned out well for you, it still doesn’t change the fact that they tried to harm you. We should return the favor to them,” Chu Feng said.

“Forget it, Chu Feng. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but this is not a grudge we can resolve. That organization is working for the Nine Souls Sacred Clan,” Song Xi said.
