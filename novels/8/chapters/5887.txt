Chapter 5888: Cooperation

“You have cleared my trial,” Sansheng Xingyu calmly said.

There was a hint of blood on her lips as she spoke, and her impassive expression only made her look off. So, Chu Feng manifested a handkerchief out of spirit power and passed it to her.

“Pardon me, I made a move on you earlier due to a misunderstanding,” Chu Feng said apologetically.

Sansheng Xingyu took the handkerchief and wiped off the blood. “You need not apologize. This is all Sansheng Qiutian’s fault.”

Her words were devoid of feelings. It was hard to tell whether she was feigning composure or her personality was simply like that, but it didn’t seem like she harbored any hostility toward him. She didn’t blame Chu Feng for making a move on her after learning the reason behind it. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Perhaps it was because he felt conscience-stricken or he earnestly thought that Sansheng Xingyu was a reasonable person, but Chu Feng’s impression of her was positive. Other than Elder Sheng, he had the highest opinion of her in the Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

Following Sansheng Xingyu, they soon arrive at a tower.

The tower was over ten thousand meters in height, but it only had a single level. It was made out of special materials to maintain a formation, though he couldn’t tell what the formation was.

“Zi Ling is in there.”

Sansheng Xingyu took out a token and formed a hand seal. The tower’s doors opened.

Chu Feng entered the tower without any hesitation and saw the true form of the formation.

It was a formidable recovery formation, and the tower was shaped in a way to enhance its potency. Its formation core was located at the top of the tower. A ray of light was shining down from the formation core, and at its bottom was where Zi Ling lay.

She was bathed in the formation’s recovery energy. She was so focused on her recovery that she didn’t notice Chu Feng’s arrival.

To heal her injuries, she would have to first expose them. It turned out that she had been concealing a portion of her injuries all along, and her condition was more severe than Chu Feng had expected.

Chu Feng’s heart was in pain. He patiently waited for her for more than twenty hours before the formation stopped, and Zi Ling finally opened her eyes.

“Big brother Chu Feng?”

Zi Ling’s eyes narrowed like a frightened child when she saw Chu Feng. She had hidden the severity of her injuries from Chu Feng earlier, so she was horrified to have learned that she had unwittingly exposed her condition to him.

Chu Feng didn’t blame her. Instead, he opened his palm and released a recovery formation on her.

“Big brother Chu Feng...” Zi Ling felt a surge of warmth in her heart.

“Don’t speak. Focus on healing up,” Chu Feng said.

He had constructed this formation specifically for Zi Ling’s sake. It was not as potent as the tower’s formation, but it could stabilize her condition for the time being. This was the only thing he could do for her right now.

With Zi Ling’s cooperation, Chu Feng’s formation was impeccably fused into her body.

“I’m sorry, big brother Chu Feng. Did I worry you again?” Zi Ling raised her head and asked.

“How can I not be worried? I forbid you from hiding the severity of your injuries from me ever again,” Chu Feng said.

“I was worried you wouldn’t let me go with you if I didn’t do so. I’m fine. I didn’t know why my internal trauma suddenly relapsed earlier,” Zi Ling said.

“Your foundation has been shaken by your injuries, so it might relapse at any moment. You might have suffered a relapse because you were worried about me,” Chu Feng analyzed.

“That’s possible. Big brother Chu Feng, where are we?” Zi Ling asked.

Through their exchange, Chu Feng learned that Zi Ling had been waiting in front of the spirit formation gate when she was suddenly enveloped by a surge of teleportation energy. The teleportation energy was so potent that it made her worry about Chu Feng, and that was when her injuries suddenly relapsed.

By the time the teleportation energy vanished, she was already inside this tower.

Sansheng Xingyu was there too, but she didn’t bother explaining things to her. She simply told Zi Ling that the formation in the tower would help her injuries and told her to focus on recuperating.

As a result, Zi Ling knew next to nothing about this place at all.

Chu Feng quickly told Zi Ling everything he knew about this place.

“I see. This place has deep ties with my master. Are they looking to work together with you, big brother Chu Feng?” Zi Ling asked.

She thought that the Three Saints Monstrous Clan had brought them into the city because they had a favor to ask of him.

“That might be so. We’ll know once we walk out of this tower.” Chu Feng shared the same thoughts as Zi Ling.

Surprisingly, Sansheng Xingyu was nowhere to be seen when they left the tower. Instead, they were met with a stern-looking, middle-aged man who stood with his hands behind his back.

“Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief?” Chu Feng asked.

“You met me before?” The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was astonished to hear Chu Feng accurately identify him.

“I met your son, Sansheng Qiutian,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ah, I see. As expected of Chu Xuanyuan’s son. You’re pretty smart.” The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief chuckled.

“Lord Clan Chief, feel free to speak if there’s anything you need from me,” Chu Feng said.

“Good. You’re a candid one, so I shan’t beat around the bush then. Elder Sheng should have told you about our ties with your father. He has contributed greatly to our Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, but he has committed a huge sin too. Even when we weigh the two against each other, his sins still outweigh his contribution. Thus, we still see him as an enemy.

“However, I shan’t pin your father’s faults on you. You didn’t know about your father’s ties with us before coming here, so I reckon you have other motives. If I’m not mistaken, you’re hoping to find a fortuitous encounter here. I’m willing to give you the opportunity, but I have to explain things to you first.

“Our Three Saints Monstrous Clan has a sacred mountain. It is filled with formations and our clan’s secrets. Every single formation is a fortuitous encounter, and deciphering them will benefit not just our Three Saints Monstrous Clan but outsiders like you too. However, our clansmen are unable to decipher some of the formations, so we need to engage the help of outsiders like you.

“Your father helped us decipher quite a few formations back then, but there are also some beyond his means to deal with. I can see that you’re a talented world spiritist even though your spirit power might be lacking at the moment. Nevertheless, it’s worth giving it a try. However, I need to warn you that there are factors inside the sacred mountain that are beyond my control even if I travel with you.

“You are a smart person, so you should know what I’m getting at. It’s up to you whether you wish to go or not, but I can tell you straight up what the benefits are. Our sacred mountain contains unique energy that might just be able to cure this young miss’ injuries, but that’s only if you can decipher the formation,” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief said.
