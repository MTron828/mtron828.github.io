MGA: Chapter 958 - Endless

“Insolence! Who do you think you are to call my ancestor by name directly?!” The people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago were furious. They pointed at the person who spoke, and were about to make their move. That person’s actions meant they undoubtedly came here to stir up trouble.

“Wait.” However, just at that moment, Murong Mingtian stopped them. Moreover, he cast his lightly squinting gaze at the long-robed person, and sneered, “When my Immortal Execution Archipelago and the three clans arrived at the Misty Peak, Chu Feng wasn’t even capable of participating in battle. He could only stay on the side and watch. If it weren’t for Lady Piaomiao who sacrificed herself to bring Chu Feng and Qiushui Fuyan away, he would have already died. Do you think he will still dare to come?”

“That may not be so.” The person lightly smiled, then said, “Everyone knows Chu Feng is a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, and they always emphasize camaraderie. I’ve even heard the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s army has secretly gathered here.

“No one knows whether they’ve gathered to avenge Chu Feng or not.

“Besides, Lady Piaomiao was only injured. She hadn’t died. Are you certain after Lady Piaomiao recovers, she won’t join with the Crippling Night Demon Sect and return?”

As that person spoke, he pointed towards the crowd, and fiercely shouted, “And you, you despicable bastards! You don’t talk about Jiang Qisha taking away Chu Feng’s lover, you don’t talk about him killing innocent, and instead, you’re shaming Chu Feng! Do you not fear he’ll bring the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s army over and also cut your filthy mouths and take away your insignificant lives?”

“This...” After that person spoke, the people who were humiliating Chu Feng before changing their expressions greatly. An indescribable chilliness was born in their hearts.

Were they not afraid of Chu Feng? Of the Crippling Night Demon Sect? Of Lady Piaomiao?

They were. Of course they were. They were even more afraid after that person spoke. To dare to directly say Murong Mingtian’s name in a place like this, and even words like those, meant he didn’t come with kind intentions. He was likely one of Chu Feng’s people.

“Haha, no matter the Crippling Night Demon Sect, or Chu Feng, whoever dares to come, I’ll do the same to them as I will to you! Not even a trace of soul or corpse will remain!”

Murong Mingtian roared with laughter. Amidst that laughter, however, he suddenly waved his sleeve. A boundless Martial power was released, and after a boom, the long-robed person was destroyed.

The observers couldn’t help letting out a relieved sigh. His actions were undoubtedly telling the crowd that with him here, even if Chu Feng and the others truly dare to come, it would be no more than committing suicide. No one could stir up trouble in this place. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Not even a trace of soul or corpse will remain! Are you certain?” But just at that moment, the voice rang out again. At the same time, a figure quickly flew over. When it neared, everyone was astonished.

This time, the person did not wear a long robe, so his face was clearly shown before the crowd.

However, he had a very blurry complexion. Most importantly, his entire body was translucent, and it was shining with light. That was simply not a normal person’s appearance, but more like a Consciousness.

“Consciousness? It’s a Consciousness?”

“That’s not right. Even if he is, it would have been destroyed. Just now, Senior Murong had clearly killed him. How could he possibly reappear?” Many people started panicking as they felt the oddness of that person.

“Hoh, no matter who you are and what sort of tricks you’re playing, I’ll leave you with a few words: If you appear once, I’ll destroy you once. No matter how many times you come, it’s useless.”

Murong Mingtian sneered and once again attacked. Like before, that person stood no chance against the strength of a rank seven Martial King. After a bang, he shattered.

*rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble...*

However, when that person exploded, violent rumbles came from the distance. A dense glowing mass flew over as they covered the entire sky.

“Heavens, that is?”

When the glowing figures approached, the already uneasy crowd paled from fright. Some even start trembling, because they discovered with terror that the glowing mass was formed by people. There were many—over ten million.

The most important thing, however, was that those people were the exact same as the person before. Though they appeared like Consciousnesses, their auras were very real. There were not only countless Martial Lords, there were even several Martial Kings.

“Murong Mingtian, didn’t you say if one appeared you’ll destroy one? Let us see how you will destroy us all!”

Suddenly, a cold laugh came from the crowd. At the same time, layers upon layers of horrifying martial skills shot out from the group of people. The army of ten million started mercilessly attacking everyone.

“Dammit, there’s so many, and there’s even a rank five Martial King! How is happening?” Not to mention the bystanders, even Murong Niekong and the chiefs from the Three Great Monstrous Clans were no longer calm.

“Illusions and deception! Let me see who exactly you are!” Murong Mingtian had leapt up, and with the powerful might of a rank seven Martial King, he dashed into the vast crowd.

He was really too strong. A rank seven Martial King was simply invincible. Every single strike could kill several people; numbers could not overwhelm such power.

“KILL—” After Murong Mingtian made his move, the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans joined the battlefield under the command of respectively Murong Niekong and the chiefs.

The battle instantly began. Even though the army of ten million was powerful, with Murong Mingtian, a rank seven Martial King overseeing the situation, they simply could not even approach the marriage area. In just a blink, they were all destroyed and cleanly massacred.

However, before Murong Mingtian and the others even had a chance to enjoy the delight of victory, their complexions turned grave again.

In another direction, another large mass of people appeared. No matter numbers, or strength, it was the exact same as they ones they killed before.

“Let me see how many you can send!” Murong Mingtian was clearly enraged. He leapt forward and once again dashed into the vast ocean of people. As for the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans, they too quickly followed and joined the battlefield once again.

It was the same as last time. Due to the immense difference in strength, the battle had finished very quickly even though they had great numbers.

However, after the destruction of each wave, another one would appear quickly. The direction they emerged was different every time as well—at first, they had come from the same side, but in the end, they were coming from all directions.

That repeated again and again. Even though the Immortal Execution Archipelago was capable of dealing with it, they couldn’t help starting to panic. Even if they were more powerful, their stamina was still limited. If the enemy were coming over endlessly, they would fail to hold on eventually.
