Chapter 3017 - Imminent Catastrophe

“Zhengfa, I will ask you a question. Is our Chu Heavenly Clan more important, or is the truth more important?” Chu Hanpeng asked.

“Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, why are you asking me this question?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Zhengfa, you are a smart individual. I believe you should know why I made my decision.”

“Even if it’s Lord Clan Chief, he will definitely make the same sort of decision I have."

"Chu Feng has already died. Regardless of how he has died, what’s important is that he is dead. As such, he will no longer be able to contribute to our clan. However, it is different for Chu Ruoshi and Chu Zhiyuan," Chu Hanpeng said.

"Even if that is the case, we should at least provide justice for Chu Feng. Milord, I believe that you are also capable of realizing that this matter is fishy," Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

"Justice? What use is justice? Is it capable of preserving our Chu Heavenly Clan’s continued prosperity?"

"While justice is not capable of that, excellent successors will be. Both Chu Ruoshi and Chu Zhiyuan are our Chu Heavenly Clan’s excellent successors. What we need to do is to protect them, and not to harm them," Chu Hanpeng said.

"But..." Chu Xuanzhengfa still wanted to argue.

"There’s no but."

"Ever since Chu Xuanyuan offended the people from the Starfield Master Realm, the Starfield Master Realm has always had the intention of suppressing our Chu Heavenly Clan. As for the other Heavenly Clans, they have never given up on our position as the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm."

"Right now, as we are still alive, they do not dare to act rashly. However, if our clan is to have no qualified successors, do you know what will happen?"

"Not to mention that we will not be able to safeguard our status as the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s overlord, our Chu Heavenly Clan might even be faced with a catastrophe capable of exterminating our entire clan."

"For the sake of ensuring the continued prosperity of our clan, we must nurture outstanding successors. Before that, justice and fairness are all meaningless."

"Only through having qualified successors will our clan be able to continue to exist. If our clan is unable to continue to exist, what use is there in having justice?" Chu Hanpeng asked.

At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa lowered his head and became quiet.

He was feeling extremely unreconciled. He felt deep regret for Chu Feng, and deeply wanted to obtain justice for him.

However, he also knew the situation their Chu Heavenly Clan was in at present.

Whilst their Chu Heavenly Clan was still the fully-deserving overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, a storm was gathering in the shadows.

Their Chu Heavenly Clan had made countless enemies in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. Many among them were no weaker than their Chu Heavenly Clan. All of those people wanted to seize their Chu Heavenly Clan’s title as the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

It was as Chu Hanpeng had said, with their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng, and the others present, those people would not dare to act rashly against their Chu Heavenly Clan. However, time was a heartless thing.

Their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng, and the others were already very old.

One day, they would die of old age. At that time, who would prop up their Chu Heavenly Clan? Who would stand against their enemies?”

Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others?

No, they would not be enough. After all, even the people from Chu Xuanzhengfa’s generation would one day grow old. Thus, it was as Chu Hanpeng had declared; if they wanted their Chu Heavenly Clan to continue to prosper, if they wanted their Chu Heavenly Clan to continue to exist, they had to continue to nurture outstanding successors.

As for Chu Ruoshi, Chu Zhiyuan, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, they were people of the younger generation that their Chu Heavenly Clan must nurture.

“Zhengfa, as a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, as the Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master, you should even more so protect these future hopes of our Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, do not mention the matter regarding Chu Feng anymore,” Chu Hanpeng said. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“But, if Chu Xuanyuan is to find out that his son died in our Chu Heavenly Clan, would he be willing to leave the matter at that?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

Hearing those words, Chu Hanpeng grew quiet. After a short while, he said, “I believe that he would also place an even greater importance on our clan’s safety. Otherwise, he would not have cooperated with our clan and accepted the punishment of being exiled to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.”

Chu Hanpeng seemed to also know very well that their Chu Heavenly Clan was not strong enough to contend against Chu Xuanyuan, that it was Chu Xuanyuan who had willingly accepted the punishment back then because he did not want their Chu Heavenly Clan to be placed in a difficult position by the Starfield Master Realm.

“But, Chu Feng is his son. Furthermore, Chu Feng should be his only son.”

“Back then, he was willing to slaughter the people from the Starfield Master Realm for Chu Feng. It is obvious how important Chu Feng is to him,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“He ignored Chu Feng and made him train alone. I believe he has been prepared for the fact that his son might perish outside. Thus, Chu Feng’s death cannot be blamed on anyone,” Chu Hanpeng said.

“But what if Chu Xuanyuan is to investigate into Chu Feng’s death?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“If Chu Xuanyuan wants to investigate Chu Feng’s death, who could possibly stop him? The criminal in his death will have to suffer the consequences,” after saying those words, Chu Hanpeng sighed.

After hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa said no more. He knew that if Chu Xuanyuan wanted to investigate Chu Feng’s death, no one would be able to protect Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi, including the culprit that had helped them behind the scenes.

That’s right, Chu Xuanzhengfa firmly believed that someone had helped Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi from the shadows. Although he had no idea how they’d done it, he knew that Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi, with their current strength, would not be able to defeat Chu Feng.

However, even though this was the case, Chu Xuanzhengfa still felt very ashamed at being unable to obtain justice for Chu Feng.

Alas, Chu Hanpeng had already made himself very clear. Thus, Chu Xuanzhengfa had nothing more to say. After all, what Chu Hanpeng had said was very reasonable. As a clansman of the Chu Heavenly Clan, he must indeed consider things properly for the sake of their Chu Heavenly Clan.

The Chu Heavenly Clan had never been a truly united clan. Internal struggles had always existed. If one must put a party to death due to their grievances and grudges, then their Chu Heavenly Clan’s strength would likely suffer greatly.

After this, Chu Xuanzhengfa left the palace. He discovered that the two Utmost Exalted Elders, Chu Ruoshi, Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Lingxi were all standing outside the entrance, and had not left.

“How was it, Zhengfa? You tried to persuade Lord Hanpeng for so long, did you manage to make him change his heart?” Chu Haoyan’s grandfather spoke with a mocking tone.

He firmly believed that Chu Hanpeng would not change his decision, that Chu Xuanzhengfa would have no choice but to resign himself to fate.

After all, regardless of whether it might be his strength or status, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not possess the capability to contend against the two of them.

“Humph, did you all really think that you’d gotten away with it?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“What do you mean?” Chu Haoyan’s grandfather asked.

“You all have caused the death of Chu Xuanyuan’s son. The way I see it, you all are facing an imminent catastrophe,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.
