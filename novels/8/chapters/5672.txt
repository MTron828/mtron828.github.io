Chapter 5672: I’ll Eat You Up

As soon as Chu Feng projected his consciousness into his World Spirit Space, he was enveloped by a powerful suction force that swiftly devoured his psyche. This force was coming from a sword—the Asura Sword!

Chu Feng had obtained this sword from a Divine Inheritance Ground.

According to Eggy, there were three swords in the Asura Spirit World that were said to be the strongest swords due to their unparalleled might. One of them was the Asura Sword. It was just that Eggy had never seen it before, so Chu Feng had no way of knowing if it was real.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

If the Asura Sword he had was real, this would be a big deal.

Eggy had tried to grasp control over the sword, but the sword rejected her. It was difficult for her to even approach it.

As for Chu Feng, he found that the Asura Sword would furiously devour his psyche as soon as he projected his consciousness into his World Spirit Space. If he stayed in there for too long, he could run out of psyche and die.

For that reason, he dared not to carelessly enter his World Spirit Space, and even if he did, he avoided staying for too long. He did try several times more afterward, but he couldn’t withstand the Asura Sword’s psyche devouring.

However, he had come prepared this time around.

As soon as he formed his hand seals, the rate at which the Asura Sword devoured his psyche slowed.

This was the benefit he had received from the Immemorial Meditation Method. He could alter the structure of his psyche via the Immemorial Meditation Method. This wouldn’t aid him in his construction of formations, but it made it harder for others to assimilate his psyche.

That was also the reason the Asura Sword’s devouring of his psyche had slowed.

Chu Feng made his way toward the gate, where the Asura World Spirit Army was sealed, and used Heaven’s Eye to inspect the gate. His psyche had been greatly enhanced by his cultivation of the Immemorial Meditation Method, which boosted the effectiveness of his Heaven’s Eye.

Thanks to that, it didn’t take him long to notice several things.

“I see. I knew that the Heavenly King of Massacre wouldn’t set up such a restriction for no reason.”

Chu Feng was overjoyed to have seen through the secret behind the Asura World Spirit Army’s gate.

The Asura World Spirit Army used to serve the Heavenly King of Massacre, and they were bound to him via his ability, God’s Contract.

Even though Chu Feng had cleared the Heavenly King of Massacre’s test, the Asura World Spirit Army was still bound by God’s Contract, which imposed a restriction on the number of times he could summon and utilize their strength. Beyond that, the gate would close, and the image on it would become its seal.

Chu Feng couldn’t even communicate with them though they were inside his World Spirit Space, let alone borrow their strength.

However, he didn’t think that the Heavenly King of Massacre would impose such a restriction for no reason, and what he had observed confirmed his guess. The gate was not just a sealing means from God’s Contract; it was an exceptionally powerful treasure too.

While it looked as if the Heavenly King of Massacre had abandoned the Asura World Spirit Army, in truth, he had been tempering them till they were one with the treasure. As long as the world spiritist commanding the Asura World Spirit Army was sufficiently strong, the Asura World Spirit Army would be able to tap into the treasure and gain greater strength.

In other words, as long as Chu Feng could grasp the secret behind the sealed gate, he could open it and enhance the World Spirit Army’s strength. After spending a moment examining the gate, he soon figured out its secret.

Under normal circumstances, Chu Feng would have to be a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist to gate’s secret, but he was able to overcome this limitation due to his superior psyche, which had only been further enhanced by the Immemorial Meditation Method.

He could try to channel the treasure and open the gate.

“I have never met you before, Heavenly King of Massacre, but I’m thankful to you for leaving this treasure behind. I won’t let you down. I’ll slowly bring the Asura World Spirit Army to the height they deserve to be at,” Chu Feng said as he channeled a huge flow of psyche into the gate through a peculiar trajectory.

The crux to opening the gate wasn’t about how strong one’s psyche was but how well they were able to control their psyche. Without precise control, it would be impossible for one to open the gate even if they knew the correct method.

Chu Feng’s control over his psyche had always been strong, and that had been further augmented by the Immemorial Meditation Method. He was confident that he could allow the Asura World Spirit Army to see the light of the day today.

Weng!

Weng!

Weng!

Just then, the Asura Sword suddenly shook thrice. Chu Feng hurriedly stopped channeling his psyche into the gate to warily eye the Asura Sword.

Boom!

The Asura Sword suddenly hastened its absorption of Chu Feng’s psyche, causing the depletion of his psyche to revert to its initial level despite the earlier alteration of his psyche’s structure.

“This isn’t good.” Chu Feng frowned in a dilemma.

However, he quickly made up his mind and channeled all of his psyche into opening the gate. The Asura Sword was furiously devouring his psyche, and he was using a tremendous amount of psyche to open the gate too. The slightest miscalculation could cause his life to be in danger.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng decided to put his life on the line to open the gate.

Fortunately, the seal on the gate soon reacted.

As long as he willed it so, he could open the gate whenever he liked and allow the Asura World Spirit Army to see the light of the day. He had succeeded.

However, he didn’t open the gate right away. Instead, he changed his hand seal and continued infusing his psyche into the gate. If he could lift the second seal on the gate too, he could raise the Asura World Spirit Army’s strength. The second seal was bound to be more difficult than the first seal, but the benefits were great.

If he opened the gate and reunited with the Asura World Spirit Army right away, this would be the end of this opening. He would have to wait for the gate to lock itself up again before he could unlock the second seal.

“Damn it, this Asura Sword is an eyesore. I would have been able to release the second seal if not for it,” Chu Feng cursed in anger.

The Asura Sword’s furious devouring of his psyche was getting in his way, making it difficult for him to release the second seal.

“Hm? This is…”

Chu Feng turned to look at the Asura Sword in astonishment as he realized that the latter had stopped devouring his psyche.

“What does this mean? Does it understand me?”

Just then, the Asura Sword suddenly shook. With a loud boom, a deluge of psyche poured out from the Asura Sword and flowed into Chu Feng. It was the psyche the Asura Sword had just devoured from Chu Feng, so he had no trouble taking it into his body.

However, this only left him even more confused as to what the Asura Sword meant by this.

Just then, a voice echoed from the Asura Sword, “What are you feigning ignorance for? Let me see if you’re able to continue unsealing that gate. If you fail, I’ll eat you up!”
