Chapter 4405: Black Shadow

“Lele, why would someone from the Holy Light Galaxy suddenly drop by your place? Are those people permitted in the Dao Sea? Is the Lady of Dao Sea fine with it?” Jiuhun Miaomiao asked concernedly.

“He’s a friend of our Dao Sea,” Wang Yuxian replied.

“He’s a friend of your Dao Sea? Lele, I must say that you’re too soft, and it isn’t good at all! How can you simply allow anyone to become your friend? You’re a famed genius of our Nine Souls Galaxy! You really need to change your personality and stop being so nice to everyone!” Jiuhun Miaomiao said with a pout.

It looked as if she was getting jealous of Wang Yuxian, and it looked particularly cute.

“Miaomiao, even though the overall prowess of the Holy Light Galaxy is beneath that of our Nine Souls Galaxy, that doesn’t mean that they don’t have outstanding individuals there. We can’t just look down on them,” Wang Yuxian replied.

“Lele, you’re too naive. If there are outstanding individuals in the Holy Light Galaxy, how could it have fallen behind by so much?” Jiuhun Miaomiao disagreed with what Wang Yuxian said.

“Miaomiao, you really shouldn’t look down on Chu Feng. He’s a person with great capabilities. He’s the one who helped me clear my final trial,” Wang Yuxian replied.

“Lele, you managed to clear your trial?” Jiuhun Miaomiao asked in astonishment.

“Yeap, I managed to clear it,” Wang Yuxian replied with a gleeful smile.

“Woah, I guess congratulation is in order then! It’s that Chu Feng guy who helped you with that?” Jiuhun Miaomiao asked.

“If not for him, I wouldn’t have been able to clear it,” Wang Yuxian replied.

Hearing those words, Jiuhun Miaomiao’s eyes lit up as she remarked, “After hearing how highly you regard that Chu Feng guy, I’m really getting curious as to what kind of person he is. Wait a minute. Where’s the Lady of Dao Sea?”

Wang Yuxian and the others also quickly scanned the surroundings, and it was only at this point in time did they realize hat the Lady of Dao Sea was no longer around.

It was just a moment ago that the Lady of Dao Sea was here with them to see Chu Feng off.

“This is weird. Master was here with us just a moment ago.”

Song Feifei and the others said.

“I reckon that our master had something urgent to attend to, so she left in advance,” Wang Yuxian said.

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll pay my respects to the Lady of Dao Sea later on. Lele, I have something that I need you for right now. Let’s head over to your place to have a talk,” Jiuhun Miaomiao said as she raised her arm and wrapped it around Wang Yuxian’s shoulders.

It was a very brotherly action that felt as if it had come from a man, but when paired with Jiuhun Miaomiao’s adorable appearance, it became a cute and endearing gesture instead.

Watching as Wang Yuxian departed with Jiuhun Miaomiao, Song Feifei and the others couldn’t help but feel a little envious.

That was the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. They also hoped to have such a close relationship with Jiuhun Miaomiao too, but they knew that they weren’t qualified to hope for such a thing.

Even though Jiuhun Miaomiao appeared to regard them as sisters, they knew very well that she was doing so on the account of Wang Yuxian. From the start to the end, the only one who really had a place in Jiuhun Miaomiao’s heart was only Wang Yuxian.

...

Meanwhile, the Lady of Dao Sea had returned back to her palace and settled down onto a unique bed.

This bed was forged out of a Nine-colored Jadestone, and it emanated a nine-colored mist that had the effect of healing one’s injuries.

The Lady of Dao Sea sat on top of the bed with her legs, seemingly channeling her cultivation skill.

Her complexion didn’t look too good at the moment. Her face was pale, and her lips were a little ashen. It was almost as if she was poisoned.

Pu!

Suddenly, black blood spurted out of her mouth.

However, the Lady of Dao Sea showed no panic at this situation. Instead, she appeared to be relieved by it. Nevertheless, her complexion still didn’t improve.

As if there wasn’t an ounce of strength left in her body anymore, she fell backward onto the bed and lay down motionlessly.

“The great Lady of Dao Sea actually ended up in such state for her disciple. I wonder how many people would believe this if word were to spread,” a feminine voice suddenly sounded.

The Lady of Dao Sea calmly glanced toward where the voice was coming from, and she was a black shadow standing by the corner of the room.

“Big sister, when did you arrive?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked with a joyful look on her face.

“I just arrived. You were too preoccupied with forcing out the poison from the forbidden medicine that you consumed that you didn’t notice me,” the black shadow replied.

“Why bother mocking me when you don’t want to help me on this matter?” the Lady of Dao Sea harrumphed.

“Little sister, you have really spared no effort to groom Wang Yuxian. All this while, she thought that the reason why she could clear those trials in the training spot easily was due to her superior talent, but little does she know that you have been secretly controlling formations from the shadows to aid her.

“In order to help her, you even resorted to consuming forbidden medicine in order to raise your strength, but you hid it all from her out of worry that it would burden her. Is it really worth going that far for a junior?” the shadow asked.

“Of course it’s worth it. She’s the person prophesied by the Spirit Rock of Prophecies. She’s the person who will prevent a calamity from befalling the Nine Souls Galaxy,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

“Why are you so superstitious? If prophecies are really that accurate, why would cultivators need to work so hard to raise their strength then?” the shadow replied skeptically.

“Big sister, the fortuitous encounters and luck of a cultivator are also the design of heaven. The prophecies made by the Spirit Rock of Prophecies have never been wrong before,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

“The Spirit Rock of Prophecies would usually reveal the complete information about a matter or a person when it prophesizes the future. Yet, all that can be seen on it is just Wang Yuxian’s silhouette. That isn’t enough to show that she’s the person who would prevent the calamity from occurring!” the black shadow exclaimed.

“She’s the person who has appeared on the Spirit Rock of Prophecies. Who else could it be other than her?” the Lady of Dao Sea replied.

“It’s one thing if you regard that lass highly and wish to groom her, but is there really a need for you to associate her with that so-called calamity? Well, do as you please. She won’t surpass that lass of mine anyway,” the black shadow said. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Big sister, you keep speaking about that lass, but when are you going to show her to me? I’m interested to see whether she’s really as talented as you put her out to be,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

“No hurry. You’ll meet her when the time comes. Alright, I’ll be leaving now. You should focus on recuperating from your injuries.”

After saying those words, the black shadow left right away.

“She sure comes and goes as she pleases,” the Lady of Dao Sea remarked with a slightly forlorn look on her face after the black shadow disappeared.

All of a sudden, however, her eyebrows shot up in astonishment.

“This feeling...”

She quickly reached for her Cosmos Sack and took an item. It was a bizarrely-shaped rock with the word ‘Prophecy’ written at the back. On the front of the stone, there was a figure reflected on it.

“This... How could this be? Could it really...”

The Lady of Dao Sea widened her eyes upon seeing the person on the stone. An indescribable expression appeared on her face, as if something had agitated her deeply.

She couldn’t be blamed for having such an expression as the figure that had appeared on the Spirit Rock of Prophecies was complete, such that she could see the figure’s face extremely clearly.

However, the person reflected on the rock was no longer Wang Yuxian but Chu Feng!
