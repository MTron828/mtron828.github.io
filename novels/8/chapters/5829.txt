Chapter 5830: Auctioning the Fragment

“Milord, could it be that you have prior knowledge about this Junior Blessing Formation?” the beautiful elder asked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s my first time seeing it today.” Chu Feng shook his head.

“How did you know the formation bead will glow in resonance with that formation?” The beautiful elder couldn’t curb her curiosity.

“I took a closer look when you said you didn’t know how to verify the resonance. I realized that the formation bead should have emanated a similar glow to the formation upon resonance, but due to age and the interference of other formations, the formation bead lost that property. My formation serves to repair the formation bead back to its original state,” Chu Feng said.

“You have sharp eyes, milord. I’m certain you’d be interested in our next item then,” the beautiful elder said.

Chu Feng chuckled. He figured it was time for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment to make an appearance.

Chu Feng took the Junior Blessing Formation and made his way back to the compartment. When he passed by Little Fishy, he couldn’t help but ask, “Why did you come out?”

“That fellow was too arrogant. I couldn’t stand it,” Little Fishy replied.

“Load of bull. You just can’t stand watching others bullying the person you like, right?” Xianhai Shaoyu whispered.

“Don’t talk nonsense!” Little Fishy glared at Xianhai Shaoyu.

Through the cloak, Chu Feng patted Little Fishy’s head and said, “Next time we encounter such a situation, you shouldn’t come out unless I call for you.”

He was worried about Little Fishy’s recklessness. Granted they were in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s territory, it was still best for her to kick this habit as soon as possible. What if a similar situation happened again and there was no one to protect them?

Chu Feng could deal with the consequences himself, but there might be further complications if Little Fishy made an appearance.

Little Fishy obediently nodded. “All right.”

Shortly after Chu Feng and the others returned to their compartments, another item was pushed onto the auction stand.

“It’s finally here.”

The item was covered in a cloth that hindered their detection, but its small size still evoked the crowd’s excitement. Most of them were here for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip, after all.

“Most of you must have already guessed what this item is, so I shan’t beat around the bush. What I have here with me is a God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment. I shan’t spend too much time introducing the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip since most of you are familiar with it. It is a priceless treasure that is of unparalleled value to a cultivator.

“However, some of you might be unfamiliar with what a God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment is. It is related to the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip, but we shouldn’t conflate the two terms together. Allow me to do a brief introduction about the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment.

“The God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment originated from the Ancient Era, with two legends surrounding it.

“In one of the legends, multiple powers were fighting for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slips, and one of them wanted to ruin it all after falling into defeat. He unleashed a devastating force that damaged most of the God Bestowment Bamboo Slips, with only a few remaining intact. Due to that, if one opens up a God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment, they could either find an intact God Bestowment Bamboo Slip or an ordinary bamboo slip that had lost its powers. The only way to know is to peel open the special layer covering the bamboo slip.

“In another legend, a cunning world spiritist devised the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragments in a bid to earn money. He covered the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip with a special layer to hinder others from seeing what was within, and he slipped in a few real ones inside the fragments so that others would be hopeful. He sold these fragments at a much lower price than the real thing. Most people only obtained ordinary bamboo slips, but there were still a few who got the real deal. Due to that, the fragments sold pretty well. As the number of fragments decreased, the prices started to hike up.

“It’s impossible to say for sure which of these two legends are real, but it’s a fact that there are very few fragments left in the world. Due to that, the prices of the fragments, even though it was more likely to just contain a normal bamboo slip, had hiked up to a level comparable to God Armaments. Today, our Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild will be auctioning a God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment.”

The beautiful elder finally pulled off the cloth, revealing the true form of the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment.

It was a bamboo slip covered in dust. The dust was made out of a special material that resisted spirit power.

“Brother Chu Feng.” Xianhai Shaoyu turned to Chu Feng.

“Let me take a look.” Chu Feng carefully examined the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment.

Those in the other compartments did the same too.

However, it was nigh impossible to discern the authenticity of a God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment. It was a gamble. Those fortunate to find a real God Bestowment Bamboo Slip would be blessed with countless generations of fortune.

Thus, some immediately asked, “What’s the starting bid?”

“The starting bid is 60 million sycees,” the beautiful elder replied.

“What? 60 million sycees?”

“Who don’t you go rob someone instead? It’s even more expensive than good God Armaments!”

The crowd was still stunned despite having mentally prepared themselves for it. After all, this was just a fragment and not the real deal! It would be truly taxing if someone forked out such an exorbitant price, only to find an ordinary bamboo slip inside.

“Milords, you should know how rare God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragments are nowadays. We can’t guarantee there’s a God Bestowment Bamboo Slip inside, but this fragment is the real deal. I’ll be frank here. Our chief has bought it for 80 million sycees. It’s already a bargain to sell it at this price,” the beautiful elder said.

“80 million sycees? Are you sure?” The crowd was doubtful.

“60 million sycees. I’ll take it,” an elder spoke up.

The elder who spoke was the person whom Xianhai Shaoyu suspected to be a Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Saint-tier elder.

“65 million sycees,” someone else immediately upped the bid. It was the young man wearing the rucksack-like world spiritist cloak from earlier.

“70 million sycees,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elder spoke up.

“75 million sycees.” The young man wasn’t backing down.

60 million sycees was already beyond what most people could accept. 75 million sycees was enough for them to give up on it.

However, these two were so wealthy that they soon hiked the price up to 100 million sycees. The one who made the bid was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elder.

However, the young man continued hiking up the price, “110 million.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elder finally fell silent.

He was indeed Jie Yefeng, one of the 36 Saint-tier elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. There were other elders in his compartment room, and they were from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion too.

“Who in the world are they? How dare they compete with us?” one of the elders grumbled in displeasure.

“Don’t worry about it. 100 million sycees exceed the reasonable price for a sliver of hope. It’s unlikely that there’s a real God Bestowment Bamboo Slip in it, so let him take it if he wants it,” the Saint-tier elder said.

The other elders shut their mouths.

Just then, another voice echoed, “200 million.”
