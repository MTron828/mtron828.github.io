Chapter 3075 - The Confident Chu Feng

The Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations had been watching everything unfolding before them with the attitude of enjoying a show.

Originally, they had thought that the drama would continue.

They did not expect that Chu Feng, the victim in all this, would not immediately take revenge upon his clansmen that tried to kill him, but instead turn his spearhead to them, mere bystanders.

“Chu Feng, son of Chu Xuanyuan.”

“I, Li Yan, would like to see exactly what sort of ability you might possess.”

Right at that moment, Li Yan’s body shifted, and he arrived on the battle stage.

The moment Li Yan landed, his aura was released. The aura of a rank five Heavenly Immortal surrounded the entire stage.

Everyone was able to sense Li Yan’s strength.

“He’s actually a rank five Heavenly Immortal.”

“Amazing.”

Upon sensing Li Yan’s strength, many people began to exclaim in admiration. The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generations also began to feel extremely ashamed.

They were currently at the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition. Practically all of the most outstanding younger generations of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were present.

However, their cultivations were generally only at the True Immortal realm. Furthermore, the great majority of them had not even reached the peak of the True Immortal realm. This was obvious as the winner of the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition, Chu Zhiyuan, was only a rank one Heavenly Immortal. From this, one could determine the overall quality of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generations.

As for the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, some random woman was already a rank one Heavenly Immortal.

Furthermore, her fighting techniques were extremely skilled. Her power could be seen by how she managed to defeat Chu Zhiyuan, the winner of the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition.

As for the one that came out after her, Chu Youbin, he was a rank three Heavenly Immortal.

As for the one that came out now, Li Yan, he was even more amazing. He was a rank five Heavenly Immortal.

They had proved the claims of that woman from the Li Heavenly Clan. It was as she had said, she was the weakest amongst the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations present.

Facing such a powerful Li Yan, how exactly would Chu Feng confront him?

Even though Chu Feng was famed throughout the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for his demon-level genius fighting power, it remained that Chu Feng’s cultivation before he disappeared was only that of a rank six True Immortal.

Even if Chu Feng had managed to make progress in his cultivation during the time that he had disappeared, how much progress could he possibly have made?

Would he truly be able to contend against the Li Heavenly Clan’s rank five Heavenly Immortal-level genius? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The crowd were filled with doubts regarding this.

However, they did not say anything. Instead, they stared at Chu Feng with worry in their eyes.

Seeing Chu Feng’s expression, the crowd grew even more confused.

The reason for that was because there was no trace of panic present on Chu Feng’s face. They did not understand if Chu Feng was being reckless, or if he truly was capable of taking on Li Yan.

Before the crowd’s gazes, Chu Feng asked, “Rank five Heavenly Immortal, is that your actual cultivation?”

“Precisely,” Li Yan answered.

“In that case, are you the strongest among the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations that came here today?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why are you asking that?” Li Yan frowned slightly. He was able to tell that there was ill-intent behind Chu Feng’s question.

“If you are the strongest, I will fight with you so that you all will not have journeyed here for nothing.”

“However, if you are not the strongest, I’d urge you to go back and call for the strongest amongst you to face me so as to not waste both of our time, and not make you humiliate yourself,” Chu Feng said.

“Woosh~~~”

Once he said those words, the crowd was completely astonished.

Chu Feng’s words were simply too arrogant.

He simply did not place his opponent in his eyes at all. However, his opponent was no ordinary character; he was a rank five Heavenly Immortal.

“You’re trying to say that I, Li Yan, am no match for you, right?” Li Yan chuckled. He said, “I know that you’re trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.”

“However Chu Feng, I, Li Yan, am not as mediocre as you imagine me to me. The abilities that I possess might surprise you.”

“I might as well tell you the truth. Indeed, among our Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations here today, I, Li Yan, am not the strongest.”

Once Li Yan said those words, the crowd’s expressions all changed. They then subconsciously turned their gazes to the Li Heavenly Clan’s war chariot.

They were unable to see through that war chariot. However, after hearing what Li Yan said, they guessed that there must be an even more powerful existence inside the war chariot.

“A member of the younger generation that’s even stronger than Li Yan, could it be that person?”

“That person? Which person?”

“Who else? It’s naturally the strongest person of the younger generation from the Li Heavenly Clan, one of the ten strongest members of the younger generation in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, one of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Li Anzhi.”

“Li Anzhi? Would a genius like that really come here?”

Once Li Yan said those words, he immediately brought forth a major commotion. Many people of the older generation revealed longing expressions in their eyes as they looked to the Li Heavenly Clan’s war chariot.

If they were truly able to witness Li Anzhi’s elegant demeanor, it would be a sort of honor to them.

The Ancestral Martial Decastars possessed an extraordinary significance.

All those that were able to obtain that title in their youth would definitely become grand characters in the future.

Right at that moment, Li Yan added, “However, with your mere rank four Heavenly Immortal-level cultivation, you are far too inadequate to fight him.”

As he said those words, the refined and cultured Li Yan actually revealed an expression of contempt in his eyes as he looked at Chu Feng.

“Rank four Heavenly Immortal, is that Chu Feng’s cultivation?”

“Chu Feng is a rank four Heavenly Immortal now?”

“Could that really be true?”

Li Yan’s words of mockery toward Chu Feng astonished the crowd once again.

This was especially true for Chu Ruoshi, Chu Zhiyuan, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu, Song Yunfei and the others. Their expressions changed enormously.

Rank four Heavenly Immortal, this disparity in strength was simply too enormous, no?

Did Chu Feng really manage to increase his cultivation to that of a rank four Heavenly Immortal in such a short period of time?

Even though the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations declared that Chu Feng had defeated them inside the Upper Realm Gate, many people still suspected Chu Feng to be a rank four Heavenly Immortal.

“Whether or not I, Chu Feng, possess the qualifications is not up to you to decide,” Chu Feng said.

“Then who is it up to?” Li Yan asked.

“It is up to me to decide,” After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng’s body shifted, and he rapidly flew toward Li Yan.

At the moment when Chu Feng moved, his aura was also released. Rank four Heavenly Immortal.
