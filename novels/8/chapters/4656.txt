Chapter 4656: Captured

As soon as Lord Yunliang appeared, Chu Feng grabbed Wang Yuxian’s wrist and set up a formation around the two of them.

Of course, he knew it was impossible for such a formation to fend against Lord Yunliang. In truth, his goal wasn’t to use the formation to protect them, but to strike up a connection between him and Wang Yuxian so as to buy time to escape from here.

There was already a teleportation formation set up within his body that would allow them to leave.

This was the formation left behind by that mysterious old man inside the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace.

Back then, the mysterious old man used divine golden flames to clear away Chu Feng’s Thousand Transformations’ demonic power before leaving behind a teleportation formation within his body. This teleportation formation was intended to help him escape from the Wretched Black Demon if things got desperate.

There were two ways to activate the formation.

One was for Chu Feng to activate it manually, and the other one was a passive activation.

For manual activation, it would require Chu Feng to trigger it on his own accord. As for passive activation, the formation would automatically activate when he was faced with a lethal blow, allowing him to escape from any desperate quandary he was in.

Fortunately, this formation wasn’t just limited to himself, which meant that he could bring friends away with him. It was with this formation that Chu Feng dared to continue participating in the matchmaking convention even at the risk of offending the Gongsun Clan.

That was also why when Yu Sha and Eggy were fighting with others and ended up in a disadvantageous position, he could advise them to retreat.

Even if they lost the battle, he could still take them away with him safely. There was no need for them to pit their lives on the line.

“How could this be?! It’s blocked off... There’s some formation in the Asura Graveyard that’s sealing off the teleportation formation in my body!”

However, when Chu Feng tried to activate it, his face paled in horror. He realized that he was unable to activate the teleportation formation at all!

Or to be more exact, he did successfully activate the teleportation formation, but the formation was unable to teleport him out. There was an even stronger formation sealing off this land!

This really put him in a spot.

Even though they hadn’t exchanged blows with one another, Chu Feng knew deep well that neither he nor Eggy was a match for Lord Yunliang. Even the Wretched Black Demon might not be a match for Lord Yunliang either.

Against such a terrifying existence, the only fate that awaited Chu Feng was death if he couldn’t escape.

“I realized that the two of you might be acquainted with one another, but I didn’t think that you would be so gutsy.”

While Chu Feng was at a loss as to what to do, Lord Yunliang had already begun taking steps toward him.

“Milord, she’s my friend. May I ask you to spare her?”

Realizing that they were in bad circumstances, Chu Feng quickly shielded Wang Yuxian behind him.

Surprisingly, instead of dealing with Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian, Lord Yunliang flicked his sleeves, and a surge of black aura burst forth. Then, with a ‘peng peng’ sound, the shackles binding Wang Yuxian were forcefully pried open.

His actions left Chu Feng at a loss as to what to do, and the words he spoke right after were even more so baffling.

“Take out the clones you have made with your formations beforehand,” Lord Yunliang instructed.

“Milord, this...”

Chu Feng looked at Lord Yunliang with a conflicted look on his face.

“Don’t you want to bring your friend out?” Lord Yunliang asked.

“... Thank you, Milord.”

Chu Feng couldn’t tell if Lord Yunliang was sincere about helping him, but he still quickly took out the clone of Wang Yunxian he made beforehand.

Shoosh!

As soon as the cloned Wang Yuxian was brought out, Lord Yunliang flicked his sleeves, and the shackles immediately clamped down on the limbs of the clone.

“Halt the breathing of the clone. It’ll be much easier to deal with this if she’s already dead,” Lord Yunliang ordered.

Chu Feng’s earlier thought was to create an exact replica of Wang Yuxian to replace her, so the clone was able to breathe and talk. However, after hearing Lord Yunliang’s words, he felt that the other party’s words made sense, so he quickly abided by his orders and made the clone into a fresh corpse.

“Milord, I’ll surely repay the favor some other day,” Chu Feng bowed deeply to Lord Yunliang.

It was not that his doubts toward Lord Yunliang had been completely dispelled, but at the very least, it would appear that the latter was sincere about helping him bring Wang Yuxian out of this prison. Otherwise, there was no need for him to go through this trouble.

“There’s no need to thank me. There’s a favor I need you to help me on. I’ll use my power to suppress the guards outside. I need you to use your formation to clear off their memories.

“You have entered this place disguised as me, so if anyone notices that something is amiss, I’d be the first one to be suspected. Thus, we need to erase their memories to be safe,” Lord Yunliang told Chu Feng.

“Milord, I apologize for the trouble I’ve brought you,” Chu Feng replied in guilt.

“Stop saying such useless words and hold on tightly.”

Lord Yunliang opened the doors to the prison before releasing a sudden burst of power. All of the guards were immediately trapped in place before suddenly losing consciousness one after another.

It wasn’t just so easy as knocking them out; it also thinned their consciousness too. This made it much easier for Chu Feng to wipe off their memories.

Once the deed was done, the three of them quickly made their way to Lord Yunliang’s sleeping chamber. After arriving at the destination, Lord Yunliang was just about to leave when Chu Feng suddenly spoke up and asked, “Milord, why did you help me?”

“It’s so that you can focus your effort on fusing your formation into the energy inside the bottle. If we fail to obtain the item, neither you nor your friend will be getting out of here. I should also warn you in advance that you shouldn’t even attempt to flee with your friend, and don’t try to steal the energy inside the bottle or else your life will be forfeit.”

Lord Yunliang left behind those words before leaving once more.

Chu Feng didn’t get straight to constructing the formation roight away. Instead, he first treated Wang Yuxian and stabilized her condition. She was simply in too frail of a state that she could lose her life at any moment.

“Chu Feng, what’s your relationship with that man?” Wang Yuxian asked worriedly.

“Swallow this pill first.”

Chu Feng passed a pill over to Wang Yuxian, and the latter swallowed it without any hesitation. Then, while treating Wang Yuxian’s condition, he began sharing his circumstances with her.

On the other hand, Wang Yuxian also shared how she came to be at the Asura Graveyard too.

As it turned out, Wang Yuxian was captured here. She had left the Dao Sea to complete a mission her teacher had entrusted her with, but two mysterious men captured her and brought her to this place.

She wasn’t the only one who was kidnapped by the two mysterious men; it was the same for the others inside the prison cell too. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ever since they were captured, their bloodline powers would be sapped from them every single day.

As for what the evil spirits needed their bloodline powers for, Wang Yuxian didn’t know a thing at all. However, if there was anything she could be sure of, those two mysterious men were incredibly powerful.

On top of that, she couldn’t verify whether they were evil spirits or cultivators.
