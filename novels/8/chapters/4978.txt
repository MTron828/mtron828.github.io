Chapter 4978: Crisis in the City

There should have been something placed on top of the stone tablet, but it was no longer there. The person who took it was likely to have been Dugu Lingtian.

He was the one who claimed the heritage, so it made sense that he was the one who took everything away from this place.

“I also heard from my master that the owner of this ancient remnant is known as Godsoul Immortal Exalted,” Zi Ling said.

“Zi Ling, how much do you know about Godsoul Immortal Exalted? Is he a formidable person?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

The previous Holy Monarch of the Holy Valley appeared to be obsessed with this ancient remnant, hinting that it was no ordinary place. So, he was curious to know just what kind of person Godsoul Immortal Exalted was.&nbsp;

“I’m not too sure about that. My master doesn’t seem to know much about it either as the person who first discovered this place was Lord Dugu Lingtian. It was also Lord Dugu Lingtian who told my master about this place, but he didn’t mention much about Godsoul Immortal Exalted’s heritage,” Zi Ling said.

There was a sudden change in Zi Ling’s expression.

“What’s wrong, Zi Ling?”

Chu Feng quickly rushed forward and asked out of concern.

“I’m fine, big brother Chu Feng. It’s just that… I heard a voice,” Zi Ling replied.

“What voice?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s coming from the Blood-red Ancient Tower inside my body,” Zi Ling replied.

Chu Feng immediately caught the drift.

The Blood-red Ancient Tower inside Zi Ling’s body was planted in her by Chu Xuanyuan. It boosted Zi Ling’s talent, allowing her to keep up with Chu Feng’s footsteps. It was just that the tower came with severe side effects that threatened even Zi Ling’s life.&nbsp;

Chu Feng had to give the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor he had earned with great hardship to Zi Ling in order to suppress the Blood-red Ancient Tower, but even so, he was unable to completely remove the effect of the backlash.

The reason behind that was due to the Blood-red Ancient Tower being a living being. Chu Feng had once heard a feminine voice speaking to him from the Blood-red Ancient Tower.

According to her, Zi Ling had to open the door into the Blood-red Ancient Tower in order to clear its trial and preserve her own life. There was no clear explanation as to how Zi Ling could go about doing that, but it seemed to be related to her soul energy.&nbsp;

That was the only time Chu Feng was able to speak to that mysterious feminine voice.&nbsp;

What surprised him back then was the fact that Zi Ling was unaware that the Blood-red Ancient Tower was a sentient being, but the latter appeared to be taking the initiative to talk to her right now.&nbsp;

“Is it a female elder?” Chu Feng asked.&nbsp;

“Yes. It seems to be the same elder whom you previously talked to.”

Zi Ling couldn’t help but feel excited since this was the first time the mysterious woman inside the Blood-red Ancient Tower was talking to her.&nbsp;

“What did she say?” Chu Feng asked.

“She said that there’s a powerful source of soul energy over there, and she wants me to get it. She says that she’ll reward me if I’m able to acquire the soul energy,” Zi Ling pointed to the stone gates as she spoke.&nbsp;

It was the direction where Chu Feng had come from.

“Did she say anything else?” Chu Feng asked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Nothing else.”

Zi Ling shook her head.

“Let me give it a try.”

Chu Feng placed his hand on Zi Ling’s body and attempted to establish contact with the Blood-red Ancient Tower, but he didn’t get any response. That brought a knit between his eyebrows.&nbsp;

“Big brother Chu Feng, did the elder say anything?” Zi Ling asked.

“No, but I have a good idea what she’s referring to,” Chu Feng replied.

“What is it?” Zi Ling asked.

“Follow me.”

Chu Feng led Zi Ling in the direction where he had come from. He guessed that the mysterious existence inside the Blood-red Ancient Tower must have sensed the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound since it was known for its soul energy.&nbsp;

“Zi Ling, when did your master send you to this ancient remnant? Did she leave right after sending you here?” Chu Feng asked.&nbsp;

“My master sent me here right after you left. She left right after sending me here, but she told me to wait for her there and forbade me from leaving the place on my own accord,” Zi Ling replied.&nbsp;

“Oh.”

Chu Feng asked that question because he wanted to know if the person who had been secretly protecting him was the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. Zi Ling’s account lent credence to that possibility.&nbsp;

If the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was really protecting him, there was a chance that she was right outside the ancient remnant. She might just choose to show herself if she were to see Zi Ling.

Of course, it was all his conjecture at this juncture.

He was slightly more careful when making his way in, so he intentionally slowed the pace of his travel. However, now that he knew all of the formations along the way, there was no need for him to worry too much anymore.

He soon walked out of the ancient remnant together with Zi Ling.

“Young hero Chu Feng, you…”

Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian quickly rushed forward upon seeing Chu Feng, only to be surprised by the astoundingly beautiful woman accompanying him.&nbsp;

“Elders, the situation is a little complicated. Allow me to slowly explain it to you.”

Chu Feng began explaining the matter to Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian.

“The heritage was already claimed by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect a long time ago? How could that be?”

As expected, Shengguang Baimei’s complexion looked horrible upon learning about the truth. How could not be upset to learn that so many prodigies of the Holy Valley had died for a futile pursuit?&nbsp;

“I guess this is life.”

Daoist Niantian shook his head in lament.

“The master of that place is abominable. Why did he leave the trials intact if someone has already claimed the heritage? So many members of our Holy Valley have lost their lives in vain because of that!” Shengguang Baimei bellowed.

Chu Feng and Daoist Niantian didn’t say anything in response to that. They knew that Shengguang Baimei needed an outlet to vent. After all, those that had died in the ancient remnant were all prodigies.

If they were still alive, the Holy Valley would have been much stronger than it currently was.

Shengguang Baimei was able to quickly adjust his emotions. He knew that there was no point getting upset and angry now, and the owner of the ancient remnant was likely to have already passed away in the Ancient Era. His energy was better used on things more productive.

“Young hero Chu Feng, let’s leave this place,” Shengguang Baimei said.

“I don’t want to leave this place yet. I’m thinking of dropping by the Monstrous King’s Life Mound,” Chu Feng said.

“Alright. We’ll accompany you there.”

To Chu Feng’s delight, Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian offered to go with him despite knowing how dangerous the trip would be. Chu Feng didn’t turn down their help because he knew that he would require their strength.

The four of them began making their way to the city, but Chu Feng felt a squeeze in his heart before they could even come close to it.&nbsp;

Sounds of explosions and clanging could be heard from the direction of the city. Something must have happened in the city.
