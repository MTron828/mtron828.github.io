Chapter 3260 - Becoming The Ruler Of The Cultivation Realm

The sudden voice caused the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen‚Äôs expressions to change.

After they turned around and saw the person who had spoken, their expressions all changed enormously.

Sure enough, there was a person standing behind them.

Furthermore, that person was extremely bold. He was standing less than ten meters away from them.

Most importantly, that person was none other than the person that had completely humiliated their Linghu Heavenly Clan during the New Excellence Assembly, Chu Feng.

"Chu Feng!!!"

After a brief moment of astonishment, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were instead overjoyed.

If they were able to capture Chu Feng, it would most definitely be an enormous accomplishment.

It would bring them much greater credit than capturing that trash from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

"Chu Feng, quickly, run away! They have come with ill-intentions, they‚Äôre planning to attack us!"

Right at that moment, a voice sounded from within the main city. It was Chu Ping.

Although Chu Ping had no idea why the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen had attacked them, he already knew that they‚Äôd come with ill-intentions.

Chu Ping was truly alarmed by Chu Feng‚Äôs sudden appearance beside the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. In panic, he immediately warned Chu Feng.

"Run away? None of you will be able to escape today!"

At practically the same time as Chu Ping called to warn Chu Feng, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen surrounded Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had walked right into them; they would definitely not allow Chu Feng to escape.

"Chu Feng, this is truly what they mean by ‚Äôthere‚Äôs a path toward the heavens that you refused to take, there‚Äôs no gate to hell but you insisted on charging in.‚Äô You shall pay for your arrogance today!"

The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen started to smile coldly as they looked at Chu Feng.

"This..."

Seeing that scene, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all deeply frightened.

They felt that Chu Feng was simply akin to a lamb in a tiger‚Äôs den.

"Everyone, do not panic. They are nothing more than a bunch of bandits. They will not be able to do anything to me," With a smile on his face, Chu Feng waved his hand at the Chu Heavenly Clansmen inside the main city to indicate to them to not panic.

Seeing his action, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen became extremely displeased.

"Chu Feng, you are truly bold! You actually dare to ignore us like this?!" A Linghu Heavenly Clansman asked.

"Why should I pay attention to you?" Chu Feng asked with a smile.

"Did you really think that we were like the newcomers in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light?" The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen asked.

"The way I see it, you all are inferior to even those newcomers," Chu Feng replied.

"Impudent!" Someone shouted.

Following that, boundless oppressive might came charging towards Chu Feng.

When the oppressive might swept past Chu Feng, everyone revealed stunned expressions.

The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were astonished to discover that their oppressive might was completely useless against Chu Feng.

Although they were astonished, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen still decided to continue attacking Chu Feng. This time, they all moved. They were planning to personally and physically capture Chu Feng.

Suddenly, many hands were placed on Chu Feng‚Äôs body.

However, the very next moment, they were completely stunned. Astonishment filled their faces.

They were shocked to discover that Chu Feng was like an immovable stone statue. Not to mention capturing Chu Feng, they were unable to even make him budge.

"How... how could this be?"

The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were all bewildered.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng shouted, "All of you, kneel!"

The next moment, all of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen fell from the air and lay flat on their stomachs. They were unable to move in the slightest.

At that moment, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen felt as if they‚Äôd descended into hell, and were completely panic-stricken. N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

The reason for that was because they were able to feel how frightening the power oppressing them was. It was a truly destructive power.

The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were actually still able to talk. Merely, none of them dared to utter another word.

They were deeply afraid that they would end up offending Chu Feng should they speak, and be obliterated by him.

Seeing the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were arrogant like gods earlier suddenly lying on the ground like dying dogs, a smile emerged on Chu Feng‚Äôs face.

In the end, this world was one where the weak were prey to the strong. If you were weak, no one would feel pity for you. You would only be bullied and humiliated by others.

However, if you were strong, the people that bullied you before would fear you.

The Ancestral Martial Lower Realm was like that. The Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were also like that. As for the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it too was like that.

"Everyone, you can come out now," Chu Feng waved his hand at the people inside the main city.

Seeing that Chu Feng had managed to make all of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that they were so afraid of lie on the ground like dying dogs with a single command, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were afraid and confused earlier all flew out of the main city and arrived beside Chu Feng.

"Little brother Chu Feng, what is going on? How did you obtain such power?" Chu Ping and the others asked at the same time.

"I have already grasped the power of a grand formation in this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Not to mention these people, even the people in the Overlord Region will not be able to do anything to me," Chu Feng answered.

"Are you serious?" Someone asked in a pleasantly surprised manner.

"Is there even a need to ask that? Did you all not witness little brother Chu Feng‚Äôs power from earlier?" Chu Ping asked.

"We‚Äôve seen it, we‚Äôve seen it," The Chu Heavenly Clansmen echoed in agreement. Joyous smiles were present on their faces.

"That said, little brother Chu Feng, are you really capable of taking on the people from the Overlord Region?" Chu Ping asked Chu Feng.

Even though Chu Ping had personally witnessed Chu Feng crushing all of the Linghu Heavenly Clan‚Äôs experts to the ground with a single command, he was still uncertain as to whether or not he was able to contend against the people inside the Overlord Region.

After all, there were other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen inside the Overlord Region.

"I am confident," Chu Feng said.

"In that case, why have they come to attack us?" Chu Ping asked.

Even though Chu Ping knew that Chu Feng possessed great power, he still wanted to understand the whole sequence of events that had led to the present situation.

Chu Feng told Chu Ping and the others roughly what had happened.

"Sssss~~~"

After finding out what had happened, Chu Ping and the others were all unable to keep themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

"Little brother Chu Feng, the Linghu Heavenly Clan has always been arrogant and despotic. There‚Äôs really no need for you to go against them like this," Chu Ping said.

"Big brother Chu Ping, you should also know that our Chu Heavenly Clan was brought out from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm by our Old Ancestor, no?" Chu Feng asked.

"I naturally know about that. It is something that everyone in the Chu Heavenly Clan knows about," Chu Ping said.

"Our Old Ancestor must‚Äôve encountered many arrogant and great powers like the Linghu Heavenly Clan."

"If our Old Ancestor had decided to submit to their rule, do you think our Chu Heavenly Clan would have its current accomplishments?" Chu Feng asked.

"This... we would naturally not have been able to," Chu Ping said.

"In this vast martial cultivation world, there are countless people more arrogant than the Linghu Heavenly Clan. If we are to become afraid after encountering those that are strong, we will forever be stifled by them."

"If one wishes to become strong, one must rebel. If one does not possess a rebellious spirit, one can only prepare to be enslaved by others."

"Our clan‚Äôs seniors ruled this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm in the past. Why is it that we cannot do the same in our generation?" Chu Feng asked.

"..." Chu Ping became speechless. Indeed, he was too cowardly.

"Big brother Chu Ping, I think what little brother Chu Feng said is correct."

"We cannot continue to act so cowardly forever."

"Before little brother Chu Feng came, we allowed ourselves to be ordered around by others. We remained obedient. However, what ended up happening?"

"They only started to intensify their humiliation of us, only started to hold us in greater contempt."

"It is only after little brother Chu Feng came that we were able to live like actual people again."

"That‚Äôs right, we‚Äôve had enough of those days in the past."

"Little brother Chu Feng, go ahead and tell us what to do. We will listen to your every command."

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen began to voice their opinions in succession.

"Everyone, do you really all trust me?" Chu Feng asked.

"We do," The crowd spoke in unison.

Chu Feng looked at Chu Ping. Chu Ping was the only one that didn‚Äôt answer.

"Little brother Chu Feng, go ahead and tell us what to do. We‚Äôll listen to you," Chu Ping said to Chu Feng.

"Very well. If everyone trusts me, then we shall pass through this spirit formation gate," Chu Feng pointed to the spirit formation gate that the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen had walked out of.

"Little brother Chu Feng, it is definitely not an issue for us to enter it. However, I wish to ask what exactly you plan to do." A Chu Heavenly Clansman asked.

Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he said, "Become the ruler of this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm."
