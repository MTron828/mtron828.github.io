Chapter 2801 - Ancient Era’s Demonic Substance

“Girl, just because I, a tiger, didn’t show my might, you’ve taken me as a diseased cat?”

“I merely accidently saw your body. Furthermore, it was you who stripped naked. I did not do anything deliberately. How much longer must you continue on with this?”

Chu Feng had arrived before Xia Yun’er. He had an extremely justified expression on his face as he denounced her.

“Your cultivation? Could it be that you concealed your cultivation earlier?”

While Chu Feng had an arrogant expression on his face, Xia Yun’er was extremely startled. She simply did not dare to believe that the Chu Feng before her could be this much more powerful than her.

After all, Chu Feng could only flee before her earlier. In fact, he had even feigned his death in order to avoid her pursuit.

How could Chu Feng’s cultivation increase by an entire level in the blink of an eye?

However, she had been staying on guard at that place the entire time. If Chu Feng made a breakthrough in cultivation during that period of time, she should have been able to notice it. After all, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was very dazzling.

However, she had clearly not noticed anything during that time. There had clearly been no tribulation lightning at all.

That was the reason why Xia Yun’er said that Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, she was truly unable to understand it. Since Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation, why didn’t he take care of her directly? Why did he flee from her instead?

Could it be that he was toying with her?

“Bastard, you reached rank four True Immortal long ago. You deliberately concealed your cultivation so as to toy with me.”

Upon thinking that Chu Feng was toying with her, Xia Yun’er grew even more furious.

Chu Feng was actually feeling very puzzled after hearing what Xia Yun’er said.

He had clearly just made a breakthrough yesterday. Why would Xia Yun’er think that he had concealed his cultivation to deliberately toy with her?

However, upon recalling how the Divine Tribulation’s lightning had strangely concealed itself, Chu Feng realized why Xia Yun’er thought he had concealed his cultivation.

“The hell do you know, this is called a good man does not fight with a woman. I merely did not wish to deal with you.”

“However, you were truly too excessive. I decided to yield to you, yet you actually chose to pursue me relentlessly without end.”

“That said, I am in a rush. I must leave this place quickly. I don’t have the time to bother with you anymore.”

“Miss Xia, I, Chu Feng, will tell you this seriously. Do not continue to chase after me.”

“As long as you do not continue to chase after me, I will temporarily not look further into you telling Yuwen Tingyi Li Xiang’s location and causing his cultivation to be crippled. We shall settle this debt in the future.”

“However, if you continue to chase after me, do not blame me, Chu Feng, for being impolite.”

“Earlier, it was you who stripped yourself naked for me. However, I will tell you this: if you continue to chase after me, I will personally strip you naked.”

“I am still young and filled with vigor. As for you, you’re quite beautiful too. If you are to be naked before me, I will inevitably be tempted.”

“At that time, if I so happened to be unable to contain myself from doing something to you, you should not blame me, Chu Feng, for being shameless. After all, it would be because you’ve forced me to do so,” Chu Feng said to Xia Yun’er with a very serious tone.

“Chu Feng, you’re shameless!!!”

Seeing how Chu Feng actually dared to threaten. Xia Yun’er was so furious that her face turned a deep red. She looked to Chu Feng with fuming rage between gritted teeth. She seemed like she was itching to tear Chu Feng to shreds alive with her teeth.

“To tell you the truth, I, Chu Feng, am not a philanthropist. I will generally do things according to my desire. I am completely unrestrained and do not care about how others view me. I will only do what I want to do.”

“Because of that, I have acted shamelessly before too. That said, if you continue to spout rubbish, I will show you what shameless is.”

After Chu Feng said those words, his eyes actually started to emit a strange light, and the corners of his mouth lifted into an evil smile.

It was as if he was truly planning to do something improper to Xia Yun’er.

Seeing Chu Feng looking like that, Xia Yun’er also grew a bit afraid. Even though she was feeling even more furious, she actually shut her mouth and said no more.

“That’s more like it.”

Seeing that, Chu Feng retrieved his oppressive might. He prepared to leave this place.

Seeing that Chu Feng was about to leave, Xia Yun’er suddenly called out, “Wait.”

“What is it?” Chu Feng turned around and looked at Xia Yun’er maliciously. He said, “Could it be that you want to test whether or not I, Chu Feng, dare to do shameless things?”

“Shut up!” Xia Yun’er shouted. Then, she forcibly contained her anger and used the most good-natured tone that she had to say, “I hope that you can keep this matter confidential.”

“If you can do that, I will let bygones be bygones. However, if you dare to make irresponsible remarks after going out, even if I must report this matter to my master, I will definitely have you die.”

Chu Feng was overjoyed upon hearing what Xia Yun’er said. The reason for that was because this was the result that he wanted the most. Chu Feng truly did not wish to offend the great characters in the Starfall Holy Land just yet.

Thus, Chu Feng asked, “I can keep this matter confidential and not mention it to anyone. However, if you dare to report this to your Starfall Holy Land and have them secretly take care of me...”

“I will definitely spread word of this matter to the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. I will have everyone know that you, Xia Yun’er, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, has been completely exposed to me, Chu Feng.”

“You!!!” Xia Yun’er was furious, and her lily-white hands were clenched so hard that creaking sounds were being emitted nonstop. However, in the end, she did not explode in rage. Instead, she gritted her teeth and said, “Very well, I will promise you that.”

“I believe miss Xia is a person that will keep her promise. Thus, farewell,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he planned to leave.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right at the moment when Chu Feng was planning to leave, he suddenly noticed an overwhelming oppressive might coming at him from behind. It swept past him and arrived at Buried Spirit Lake above him.

That oppressive might was acting like an invisible gate, and completely sealed off the upper region of Buried Spirit Lake.

Upon sensing that oppressive might, Chu Feng started to frown.

The reason for that was because that was Chu Lingxi’s oppressive might.

As for Chu Lingxi, she was a rank seven True Immortal. She was an actual demon-level genius, an existence that the current Chu Feng was simply unable to defeat.

Truth be told, Chu Feng was starting to panic. After all, if Chu Lingxi was to decide to help Xia Yun’er, Chu Feng would be powerless to do anything.

Even though he was slightly panicking in his heart, Chu Feng revealed a very calm appearance. He turned his gaze toward the fairy-like Chu Lingxi and asked, “Is there something you need?”

Chu Lingxi blinked her beautiful eyes. It was truly charming. However, an ill-intended gaze was present in those beautiful and charming eyes, “Have I not mentioned to you how one should address me?”

“Oh, that’s right. I should address you as Lady Chu Lingxi. Then, Lady Chu Lingxi, do you need me for anything?” Chu Feng asked.

“You entered the depths of Buried Spirit Lake earlier. Did you manage to discover anything?” Chu Lingxi asked.

Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief in his heart upon hearing those words. It turned out that Chu Lingxi wanted to know about the depths of Buried Spirit Lake, and was not stopping him because she wanted to help Xia Yun’er.

“To put it simply, the depths of the Buried Spirit Lake are akin to hell. I am not trying to scare anyone, but it is truly frightening down there. Thus, I did not dare to dive very deep. As such, I naturally did not discover anything.”

“That said, Lady Chu Lingxi, I would urge you not to attempt to dive down there. It is not without reason that all those seniors have died there,” Chu Feng said.

“Got it. You can go now. Remember, do not make irresponsible remarks. Otherwise, with miss Xia’s background, there is simply no need for her to do anything herself. She merely needs to give a single order, and countless people capable of killing you would hunt you down,” Chu Lingxi said with a beaming smile.

She was smiling very sweetly. Furthermore, that warning of hers was most definitely not done out of goodwill.

However, from her actions, Chu Feng discovered that the noble and extremely talented young lady before him should possess a very mischievous personality. Else, she would not be saying those words in a joking manner.

“Chu Feng thanks Lady Chu Lingxi for her warning.”

Chu Feng clasped his fist at Chu Lingxi. Then, he looked to Xia Yun’er and said, “Miss Xia, please rest assured. I, Chu Feng, am always one to keep my word. I will definitely keep my promise to you.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng soared upward and flew away from that place.

As he left, Chu Feng started to ponder in his heart.

“Eggy, I was so focused on escaping earlier that I forgot to mention this to you.”

“Say, what do you think that little brat was? It shouldn’t be an evil spirit, and it didn’t resemble a world spirit or spirit body either. Exactly what was it? How could it be so terrifying?”

“What’s this? The fearless Chu Feng is actually scared of a child?” Her Lady Queen said with a mocking tone.

“What child? How could that be considered a child? That thing was simply too frightening. Did you know that when it grabbed my wrist, I truly felt that I had taken a step into the grave?”

“That thing was most definitely not human. It was a demonic substance. That’s right, it must have been some sort of demonic substance. It is an existence that we do not know of yet. It couldn’t possibly be something from the Ancient Era, right?”

“I think it’s an Ancient Era’s demonic substance.”

“Eggy, say, those seniors that died in the Buried Spirit Lake couldn’t possibly have been killed by that little brat, could they?” Chu Feng asked.
