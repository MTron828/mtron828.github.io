Chapter 5038: Scheme Exposed

“You were coerced into it?” Sima Xiangtu asked in astonishment.

“You know Chu Feng, right? I was forced by Chu Feng to do this. He requests that you release his master and his friends, or else he’ll take my life. If anything happens to me… you’ll be the next,” Jiang Kongping said.

“I see. I understand the situation now. Young master Kongping, you need not worry. Chu Feng won’t be able to harm you as long as I’m around.”

Everything finally made sense to Sima Xiangtu. Right after he said those words, he immediately enveloped the area in his oppressive might.

“This aura… To think that Master Yin Ren was this strong!”

The crowd was shocked by Sima Xiangtu’s oppressive might. It revealed that he was a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator, which easily made him one of the strongest individuals in the Nine Souls Galaxy.

How in the world was Master Yin Ren this strong?

Putting aside the outsiders, even those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan hadn’t expected Master Yin Ren to be this strong.

In truth, Sima Xiangtu had released his spirit power along with his martial power in hopes of finding Chu Feng’s whereabouts.

“Don’t bother searching. I’m here,” Chu Feng said before rising into the sky.

He had chosen to reveal himself.

“You scoundrel. How dare you threaten young master Kongping?”

As soon as Chu Feng made an appearance, Sima Xiangtu bound Chu Feng in mid-air with his oppressive might. Other than his mouth, he wasn’t able to move any other parts of his body at all.

However, Chu Feng wasn’t worried at all.

“Sima Xiangtu, are you asking to be killed? How dare you bind me?” Jiang Kongping roared at Sima Xiangtu.

“Young master Kongping, I didn’t bind you.”

Sima Xiangtu looked at Jiang Kongping in confusion. Even though he had enveloped the surroundings in his martial power, the only person he had bound was Chu Feng.

Pu!

A dull thud suddenly echoed from Chu Feng’s body, and a huge gorge appeared in his right chest. Blood immediately started spurting out of it as though it were a fountain.

What was weird about the gorge was caused by an internal force rather than an external one. In other words, Chu Feng was the one inflicting harm on himself.

Even though Chu Feng had his body bound, he had set up formations within his body that allowed him to injure himself. In fact, he had made sure that no one would be able to stop him from injuring himself.

The moment the gorge appeared on Chu Feng’s chest, Jiang Kongping let out a scream of agony. A gorge had appeared on Jiang Kongping’s chest too in the exact same location.

The crowd was confused by the situation, but Sima Xiangtu immediately figured out what was going on. He finally knew why Jiang Kongping was berating him even though he hadn’t bound his body.

“Stop it, Chu Feng!” Sima Xiangtu roared at Chu Feng.

He knew that Chu Feng must have set up a soul-linking formation on Jiang Kong. That was the only way that two identical injuries could simultaneously appear on two different people.

If the formation was sturdy enough, Chu Feng’s death would spell Jiang Kongping’s death as well.

“Chu Feng, we can talk things out. Do not harm young master Kongping.”

To express his sincerity, Sima Xiangtu even retracted his oppressive might and set Chu Feng free. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Sima Xiangtu, do you need me to repeat myself?” Chu Feng asked.

“It looks like I’ve really underestimated you, Chu Feng. To think that you would be able to construct such a formation.”

Sima Xiangtu glared at Chu Feng with clenched jaws.

“Let’s go, we’ll talk elsewhere.”

Sima Xiangtu turned around, and Chu Feng began moving along with him. He was intending to take Chu Feng elsewhere.

Gah!

But barely after they moved an inch, Jiang Kongping let out yet another scream of agony. Sima Xiangtu quickly turned to Jiang Kongping, and he panicked upon seeing the state the latter was in.

Several more gorges had appeared on Jiang Kongping’s body, causing blood to spurt all over his body.

Of course, the same injuries had appeared on Chu Feng’s body too since he was the one inflicting them.

“Don’t even think of undoing my formation. Jiang Kongping’s life is now in my grasp. None of you will be able to save him. Stop playing tricks and release them right now,” Chu Feng spat menacingly.

“Sima Xiangtu, you old fool! Hurry up and let them go! Just try hesitating for a second longer, and I’ll get my father to kill you!” Jiang Kongping roared at Sima Xiangtu.

His attitude was much more arrogant as compared to Chu Feng.

Those who didn’t know better might have even thought that the one who had a grudge with Sima Xiangtu wasn’t Chu Feng but Jiang Kongping.

Sima Xiangtu was put in a dilemma, but he quickly made up his mind. Before everyone’s eyes, he plucked out his eyeball and crushed it, revealing the confinement formation.

“I-isn’t that the Godwish Grandmother?”

“The Lady of Dao Sea and the Sagacious Grandmaster!”

“Why are they captured there?”

An uproar broke out amidst the crowd when they saw the confinement formation. In their eyes, the Godwish Grandmother, the Sagacious Grandmaster, and the Lady of Dao Sea were lofty figures who stood at the very peak of the Nine Souls Galaxy, yet all of them actually became Sima Xiangtu’s prisoners!

What in the world was going on here?

The crowd couldn’t understand the situation at all.

Meanwhile, those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan noticed that Princess Xiaoxiao was inside the confinement formation too and flew into a rage.

“You bastard, Yin Ren! Why do you have Princess Xiaoxiao inside the confinement formation too?”

Numerous elders of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan questioned Sima Xiangtu with chilling voices. Some of them even drew their Exalted Armaments and released their oppressive might, seeking to take down Sima Xiangtu for his audacity.

“Shut up.”

Sima Xiangtu waved his sleeves coldly in response to their questions.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Multiple blades manifested out of martial power shot toward the elders of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. None of these elders wielded sufficient strength to stand against Sima Xiangtu’s attacks, such that they ended up collapsing in droves and dying amidst puddles of blood.
