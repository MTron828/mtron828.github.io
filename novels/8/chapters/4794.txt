Chapter 4794: That Is a Tombstone!

Chu Feng rushed as fast as he could in a single direction. The fortuitous encounter he was seeking for was likely to be the greatest opportunity lying in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, and it was profoundly related with all other opportunities here too.

Once he claimed that greatest opportunity, all other opportunities here would automatically disappear.

Similarly, if someone else were to claim that greatest opportunity ahead of him, Chu Feng would be unable to gain anything out of this trial too.

It was basically a competition where the winner took everything and the loser returned with empty hands.

While Chu Feng’s action would be taking away the opportunities bestowed upon Xia Yan and the others too, he felt that he still had to do it. He couldn’t allow Zuoqiu Youyu to get away after making an attempt on his life without paying the price.

If not for his Heaven’s Eye allowing him to see through the crux of the bestowed auras, Zuoqiu Youyu would have likely been the greatest winner from this trial. Considering the enigmatic nature of the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, this could very well be something huge.

There was no way Chu Feng could allow Zuoqiu Youyu to benefit from it.

Soon, Chu Feng was finally starting to approach the location marked on the complete map. By this point, he had already entered a desert, and his destination was just beyond this desert.

“Something is wrong.”

But all of a sudden, Chu Feng suddenly came to a halt.

“What’s wrong?” Yu Sha asked.

“I did see this desert on the map, but judging by the distance, I should have already passed through it and arrived at the destination by now. Yet, there’s still no end in sight to this desert,” Chu Feng said.

“Could this be a formation?” Yu Sha asked.

“I already checked the area with the Heaven’s Eye, but I couldn’t sense any spirit power in the area,” Chu Feng said.

“Then... why don’t you try heading forward a bit more? Maybe we’re already about to reach the end of the desert?” Yu Sha asked.

Chu Feng nodded contemplatively before setting off once more, but instead of flying ahead, he turned around and headed back where he had come from.

He had spent half an incense’s time in this desert so far, so he should be able to fly out of it in half an incense’s time too. Yet, as time ticked beyond half an incense’s time, Chu Feng found that he was still stuck in the desert.

Heck, he couldn’t even see the end of the desert by the horizon!

So, he tried flying as high as he could, hoping to see as far as possible. He traveled so high up that even the white clouds were far beneath him. Yet, even from such an altitude, all he could see below was yellow sand. It was as if he was trapped in a world that was made out of nothing but the desert.

“It looks like we’re really trapped. If this isn’t a formation, what else could it possibly be?” Yu Sha asked.

“There’s no need to panic. I have a way out.”

Chu Feng tried flying forward for a while in the air, but it wasn’t making much of a difference. So, he changed his mind and swooped down instead.

Whoosh!

The yellow sand gushed into the air like a magnificent geyser.

Chu Feng had darted beneath the sand, heading underground. The sand layer turned out to be much thicker than he had expected, but he chose to continue digging downward till he finally saw soil.

Relieved that he was making progress, he continued digging deeper and deeper until he stumbled upon an underground stream.

He was deep underground, but he could still discern his directions. He broke through the dirt layer and determinedly headed in a specific direction.

But not too long later, his footsteps halted once again.

“What’s wrong?” Yu Sha asked concernedly.

She was sharing vision with Chu Feng, but she wasn’t able to see anything that justified Chu Feng’s sudden halt.

“Success or failure; it all depends on this.”

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng began to dive upward. He swiftly left the underground and reappeared on the surface.

Yu Sha was amazed by what she saw right after.

Typically speaking, Chu Feng had only traveled for a short moment underground before heading out, so he ought to still be in the desert. Yet, they were no longer surrounded by yellow sand anymore; the desert was now behind Chu Feng.

Instead, they were standing before a forest of stones. This forest of stones was massive, and every single stone was of different sizes and was inscribed with unique complicated runes.

While there was no conspicuous light or anything of that sort, Chu Feng could tell right away that this forest of stones was no ordinary place. The fortuitous encounter he was looking for was right inside.

“Chu Feng, how do you know that you have to dive underground in order to pass the desert?” Yu Sha asked.

“Every formation has its own weakness. However, that desert wasn’t a formation. I can’t tell what it is either, but hoping to escape from it just by blinding running around clearly wouldn’t work. So, I tried traveling beneath the desert to see if it would make a difference, and it worked out,” Chu Feng replied.

Yu Sha felt impressed with Chu Feng’s wits. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

All it took was a change of perspectives, but it was no easy feat to attempt to think out of the box when stuck in a quandary. At the very least, she hadn’t thought of such a solution.

Had she been in his place, she would have probably continued charging aimlessly around the desert, hoping that it would somehow make a difference. She believed that many people would do the same as her when placed in the same position too.

It was precisely due to this that she felt earnest respect for Chu Feng.

“The real difficulty lies here,” Chu Feng remarked.

Despite having arrived at the destination marked on the map, he couldn’t help but frown in the presence of the forest of stones. As a world spiritist, he knew deep well that breaching this stone forest was no easy feat.

The trial would have likely come to an end by the time he was done.

Boom!

All of a sudden, the earth began to tremor as a massive hand rose from the forest of stones. The hand was pitch-black and spanned a hundred meters wide. Upon rising from the ground, it smacked down on the forest of stone.

To Chu Feng’s astonishment, instead of causing devastation to the forest of stone, the two actually overlapped with one another instead.

Soon, another massive hand rose from the ground as well. A humongous humanoid monster was gradually climbing its way out from the forest of stone.

Towering at a height of a thousand meters, it wasn’t too impressive compared to the monster carrying the monstrous elder they had encountered right after arriving at the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, but the pressure it exerted was equally frightening.

As long as this monster willed so, it could probably kill Chu Feng with just a glance.

And what made the situation even more frightening was that there were multiple of such monsters. By this point, there were already more than a dozen of them standing amidst the forest of stone, and the number was still increasing!

Looking at the forest of stone and the monsters amongst them, realization finally dawned on Chu Feng.

“Those are not stones but tombstones!!!”
