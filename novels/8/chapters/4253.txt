Chapter 4253 - Two Choices

Different from Lu Jie, who was carefully examining things, Chu Feng directly stepped into one of the spirit formations.

The reason for that was because he had already carefully examined the spirit formations earlier, and was unable to obtain any clues at all.

Even though Chu Feng had put all his abilities on the line, it remained completely useless.

Because of that, Chu Feng felt that if he wanted to breach the spirit formation, spending time, however long, to examine it from the outside would be useless. Only by stepping into the spirit formations could one see anything.

“Buzz---”

Sure enough, once Chu Feng stepped into a chess formation, the chess formation immediately transformed.

A spirit formation wall that sealed off everything appeared before him.

Although Chu Feng had entered the spirit formation chess board composed of numerous other spirit formations, the spirit formation wall that appeared before him had blocked off all of them.

Merely by looking, Chu Feng was able to tell that the spirit formation wall was truly impregnable.

He was unable to do anything to the wall.

Not to mention him, even Grandmaster Tang Chen and the others wouldn’t be able to breach it.

However, two vortexes soon appeared in the center of the spirit formation wall.

As the vortexes spun, they soon formed two spirit formation gates.

Those were two completely different spirit formation gates.

One of them shone with a blood-red radiance.

The red was gloomy and terrifying. One could even smell the reek of blood from it. That spirit formation gate resembled an entrance to hell.

As for the other spirit formation gate, it emitted a white light.

The white light was sacred and dazzling. Just by looking at it, one would yearn to enter it.

The people outside were only able to see the colors of the spirit formation gates, and nothing else.

But, as Chu Feng stood inside the chess board and before those two spirit formation gates, he was able to see through the changes within them.

The truth was that both spirit formation gates were filled with danger. But, the red spirit formation gate was clearly more dangerous.

The dangerous aura was assaulting Chu Feng head-on and permeating into him, reaching his heart from every single pore in his body.

There was simply no need for Chu Feng to carefully examine anything. He was able to sense the danger of the red spirit formation gate just by being there.

But, Chu Feng did not make his decision rashly. Instead, he activated his Heaven’s Eyes and started to carefully examine the two spirit formation gates.

The reason for that was because he didn’t trust the impact and sensation he felt from the spirit formation gates.

Chu Feng believed in the results of his own sight and judgement more.

After examining the spirit formation gates, Chu Feng discovered that the information provided by the spirit formation gates was true.

The red spirit formation gate was indeed more dangerous.

By comparison, the degree of danger for the white spirit formation gate was much lower.

Furthermore, one could breach the chess formation through either the red or the white spirit formation gates.

But, if one breached the chess formation through the white spirit formation gates, he wouldn’t be able to rescue the crowd. Instead, he would only be able to save himself.

On the other hand, if he entered the red spirit formation gate and breached the chess formation through it, not only would he be able to save himself, he would also be able to rescue all the people trapped there.

With the situation being like that, there wasn’t even a need for Chu Feng to think hard on his decision.

Even though he knew that the red spirit formation gate was more dangerous, he was determined to face the danger for Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting.

Thus, without hesitation, Chu Feng stepped into the red spirit formation gate.

“Buzz---”

After Chu Feng stepped into the red spirit formation gate, the entire chessboard turned red.

Both Chu Feng and the chess formation were masked by the red light.

The vast spirit formation was as red as the eye could see. It was very harsh to the eyes, and appeared rather terrifying. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“He chose the red spirit formation gate?”

“Shouldn’t he be able to tell with his naked eyes that the red spirit formation gate is more dangerous?”

Many people expressed confusion after seeing Chu Feng choosing the red spirit formation gate. They even began worrying for him.

Of course, apart from Grandmaster Tang Chen and a few others, the majority of the crowd were not worried for Chu Feng’s safety.

No matter how talented Chu Feng might be, he was still completely unrelated to them.

The reason why they were worried about Chu Feng’s decision at that moment was purely because he carried their fates, their lives, on his shoulders.

“Chu Feng! You damned brat! Get the hell back here!”

“Be more fucking cautious! I don’t give a fuck if you die, but if your decision fucks me over, I won’t let you get away with it!”

Different from the majority of the worrying crowd, there was someone who was shouting furiously.

That person was Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

Grandmaster Luo Tuo was an extremely shrewd person.

His shrewdness came in how his understanding toward treasures and opportunities differed from other people.

The majority of cultivators believed in the logic that treasures and opportunities could only be found within danger.

But, Grandmaster Luo Tuo did not think the same way. If he encountered any danger, he would escape immediately.

He firmly believed that as long as the forest remained, there would always be firewood.

He believed that as long as he was alive, he would be able to encounter treasures and opportunities again in the future.

Unfortunately, he had failed to escape their current predicament.

He truly hadn’t expected them to fall into such danger right after the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain opened, even though they still hadn’t entered it, and were only in its vicinity.

Unable to do anything himself, he had no choice but to place his faith in Chu Feng.

Like the vast majority of the crowd, he chose Chu Feng and Lu Jie to be their representatives.

He didn’t make his decision because he had confidence in them. It was just that he felt that those two people of the younger generation would give them the greatest chance of survival.

But, the decision that Chu Feng had made was to him, incorrect.

That was why he cursed at Chu Feng angrily, and even threatened him.

That said, his behavior brought displeasure from many people.

“Luo Tuo, what are you shouting for?”

“Young friend Chu Feng has his own viewpoints. You merely need to behave yourself and watch. What’s with all the nonsense you’re spouting?” Grandmaster Tang Chen said in a greatly displeased manner.

“That’s right. Chu Feng’s talent surpasses even Lu Jie’s.”

“Speaking frankly, apart from having trained in world spirit techniques longer than him, in terms of talents alone, no one here is qualified to criticize young friend Chu Feng.”

“Since he made that decision, there must be a reason for it. Yet you’re here shouting inconsiderately. What exactly is the meaning of this?”

“Aren’t we all going to have to place our lives in young friend Chu Feng’s hands still?”

Celestial Fairy Muzhi spoke with a great amount of contempt for Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

Although she wasn’t someone with a close relationship with Chu Feng like Grandmaster Tang Chen, she was unable to tolerate Grandmaster Luo Tuo’s behavior as a spectator.

“I am merely reminding him to be cautious.”

“I am not doing this purely for my sake. I am also doing this for you all’s sake. If Chu Feng is not cautious, not only will I die, but all of you will also die.”

Grandmaster Luo Tuo refused to admit his fault.

Grandmaster Tang Chen and Celestial Fairy Muzhi did not argue with him.

After all, they already knew Grandmaster Luo Tuo’s character very well.

“Buzz---”

Suddenly, the light emitted by the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain changed again.

With that, the crowd’s expressions changed too.

“Wuuahhh---”

Soon, there were people that started grunting in pain.

Even Grandmaster Tang Chen and the others’ faces had turned ugly.

It turned out, that the oppression from the light had grown even stronger.

“Why would the oppression become so powerful? Could it be that Chu Feng has failed his attempt to breach the spirit formation?”

The crowd began to make guesses as to what was going on.

“No, he hasn’t failed. If he had failed, you all wouldn’t be under only this much pressure.”

“But, if the person breaching the spirit formation suffers a mishap whilst breaching the spirit formations, you all will be implicated too,” the ancient voice sounded again.

Once the voice sounded, the crowd finally realized why the pressure from the light had grown stronger all of a sudden.

It turned out that it had been because of Chu Feng.
