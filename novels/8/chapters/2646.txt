Chapter 2646 - Chu Feng’s Trump Card

“Chu Feng, this is bad! You must escape! Do not worry about us!” Zi Xunyi shouted.

“B-Brother, g-get away from here!” Even Wang Qiang started to urge Chu Feng to leave.

In fact, the great majority of the people in the allied army were urging Chu Feng to escape.

The only difference between them was that some were shouting at Chu Feng, whereas others were sending him voice transmissions.

It was not that they looked down on Chu Feng.

Actually, it was already an extremely extraordinary accomplishment for Chu Feng to be able to suppress the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster to such a state with his cultivation of rank one True Immortal.

They felt that Chu Feng’s reputation as a genius was fully justified, that he was already the strongest among them.

However, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster had used some sort of unknown method that actually evolved him to such a state.

The current Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was simply too powerful. They felt that Chu Feng would not be able to defeat him no matter what.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, with a thought, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster sent forth his overwhelming oppressive might to cover the entire region. At that moment, not a single person in that region was able to move.

“Escape? All of you will die here today. All of you will die by my hands. Not a single one of you will be able to escape,” the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster said.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng slowly said, “Who told you that I’m going to escape?”

Not only was his tone calm, but there was not even the slightest change in Chu Feng’s expression. Instead, Chu Feng was looking at the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was a gaze filled with mockery.

“That Chu Feng, how could he be this confident? Could it be... he still possesses a method to contend against the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster?” Chu Yue asked.

“I’m not sure. Merely, this Chu Feng’s origin is no small matter. He might be a genius from a certain Upper Realm that was sent here to train. If that’s the case, he should have some sort of method capable of contending against the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.”

“No, it’s not should. Instead, this Chu Feng most definitely possesses trump card or cards that he has yet to use,” Chu Huai said with certainty.

“But, his cultivation is only a rank one True Immortal. He has also utilized his Incomplete Immortal Armament. What other method could he possibly have? Could it be that he’s planning to take forbidden medicines too?” Chu Yue asked.

Chu Yue felt that apart from taking forbidden medicines, there was nothing more that Chu Feng could do that would allow him to contend against the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

“That’s not necessarily the case. If he is really from a certain Upper Realm’s Heavenly Clan, he most definitely possesses some sort of powerful treasure to dare to come here to train alone.”

“With that treasure, not to mention the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, likely, even those more powerful than him will be killed,” Chu Huai said.

“I have heard of that sort of treasure before. However, only geniuses from the Upper Realms would possess that sort of treasure to protect themselves,” Chu Yue said.

“That Chu Feng is still so young. Yet he has already managed to possess that sort of cultivation. Could he not be considered a genius still?” Chu Huai asked.

“This...” Chu Yue hesitated for a while. She seemed to be unable to find grounds to refute Chu Huai. However, she didn’t really approve of Chu Huai saying that Chu Feng was a genius. Thus, she could only nod and say, “I guess he could reluctantly be considered one...”

“Look, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster has unleashed his attack,” Chu Huai said.

Hearing that, Chu Yue also cast her gaze to the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. It was only at that moment that she discovered that the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster had formed an enormous sword using his martial power.

That enormous sword was a thousand meters long. It was not a martial skill. Rather, it was formed purely with martial power.

However, the aura emitted by that enormous sword was much stronger than the Infant Soul Demon Sword that the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster unleashed earlier.

The reason for that was because the current Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was simply too powerful.

Although he had not really become a rank three True Immortal, his aura was infinitely close to that of a rank three True Immortal.

In short, the current Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster could not be considered an ordinary rank two True Immortal.

“Chu Feng, I’ll admit that you’re a rarely-seen genius. If you are to continue to mature, your future accomplishments will be unlimited. This Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will not be able to contain you.”

“But, why is it that you insist on making an enemy out of me today?”

“You’ve made the wrong decision. You should not have made an enemy out of me. However, you are already unable to go back on your decision.”

“The reason for that is because you’ve completely enraged me. I am determined to kill you.”

“I will personally end the future of a genius like you,” the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster spoke with rage fuming between his gritted teeth.

It could be seen that he was truly filled with hatred toward Chu Feng.

That was understandable too. He had been forced to take all those forbidden medicines by Chu Feng. Even his life was about to disappear. How could he not feel hatred for Chu Feng?

“This should be your final trump card, no?”

“You’ve taken a great amount of forbidden medicines to acquire your current power. After the effect of the forbidden medicine has passed, your soul will immediately dissipate.”

“For the sake of killing me, you have truly gone all-out without a concern for anything. However, there is still one thing that I must tell you,” Chu Feng said.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster started to frown. He asked impatiently, “What is it?”

“Even with that being the case, you will still not be able to injure me in the slightest,” Chu Feng said.

“What arrogance!” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was enraged upon hearing those words.

Then, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster pointed his palm at Chu Feng in a commanding manner. Then, that enormous sword formed with martial power measuring over a thousand meters long began to fly straight toward Chu Feng to attack him.

Once the enormous martial power sword started to move, a buzzing noise began to be heard. The space around it started to tremble violently. Ying Mingchao and the others, even though they were in the grand healing formation, started to sway left and right. It was as if they could fall out of the grand healing formation at any time.

However, even though the enormous martial power sword was rapidly approaching Chu Feng, Chu Feng remained motionless with a confident expression on his face.

“Why is Chu Feng still not acting? Could it be that he has given up?” Chu Yue grew anxious.

“No, with how confident he is, he most definitely possesses a method to turn the situation around. He must still have a trump card,” compared to Chu Yue, Chu Huai was confident in Chu Feng.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, a loud explosion sounded from the sky.

It was an enormous lightning strike. Like a giant dragon, it appeared in the sky and was seemingly tearing it apart.

“How could this be?”

When that lightning strike appeared, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster revealed an enormous change in expression. He was astonished to discover that the enormous martial power sword that he had sent straight at Chu Feng grew completely motionless the moment that lightning strike’s thunder was heard.

No matter how he tried to urge it to move, his enormous martial power sword was unable to proceed forward in the slightest.

At that moment, Chu Huai had an enormous change in expression. He pointed at Chu Feng and shouted, “Look! Chu Feng, he...!”

“Heavens, that is?!”

Upon looking, even Chu Yue revealed an enormous change in expression; disbelief filled her eyes.

“How could this be?!”

In fact, even that Chu Heavenly Clan’s old man who was hidden somewhere deep in the sky revealed an enormous change in expression.

That old man had been observing the battle below the entire time. Like a god, he was controlling the entire situation.

He felt that since he was helping the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, it would be impossible for Chu Feng to be able to defeat the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

However, at that moment, a frenetic expression emerged in his eyes.

That’s right, he had started to panic. He was unable to keep his calm after seeing the current Chu Feng.

“Rumble~~~~” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Another loud explosion was heard. Following that, countless nine-colored bolts of lightning appeared in the sky that was covered by the dark black gaseous flames.

The nine-colored lightnings were like countless enormous dragons galloping about in the sky. They extended continuously for miles on end. It was a spectacular sight.

“Impossible! Impossible! This is impossible!!!” Shouted the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster in a completely unwilling manner as he stared at the current Chu Feng.

Actually, at that moment, everyone was staring at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was still standing where he was. However, compared to before, he was like a completely different person.

The reason for that was because the lightning, the nine-colored lightning, was flickering in his eyes.

Most importantly, nine-colored lightning was also moving about on his forehead. Faintly, they formed a single character.

“Lightning Mark, Chu Feng was actually able to condense a Lightning Mark. He... just reached True Immortal realm and is already able to liberate the Heavenly Bloodline’s Lightning Mark’s power?” Chu Yue was unable to remain calm.

After reaching the True Immortal realm, both Heavenly Bloodlines and Divine Powers would be sealed. Only those with exceptional talent would be able to liberate those powers.

Furthermore, that was also something that required the accumulation of time to accomplish.

As for Chu Yue, although she had been a True Immortal for some time now, it remained that she was still unable to liberate the power of her Heavenly Bloodline’s Lightning Mark.

Yet, this Chu Feng, who had just stepped into the True Immortal realm, was able to liberate the power of his Heavenly Bloodline’s Lightning Mark. With this, how could she not be astonished?

One should know that even in the entire Chu Heavenly Clan, very few people were capable of liberating the power of their Heavenly Bloodline’s Lightning Mark in True Immortal realm.

As for those who were capable of liberating the power of their Heavenly Bloodline’s Lightning Mark right after becoming True Immortals, only those demon-level geniuses from their Chu Heavenly Clan were capable of accomplishing that.

“Big brother Chu Huai, you were right, this Chu Feng is truly a genius,” Chu Yue said to Chu Huai. If she did not acknowledge Chu Feng earlier, she fully acknowledged him now.

“No, he’s not merely a genius,” Chu Huai said.

“Ah?” Chu Yue was confused.

“Chu Yue, carefully look at the character on his forehead. That is no ordinary Lightning Mark. Instead, it’s the legendary Divine level Lightning Mark,” Chu Huai said.
