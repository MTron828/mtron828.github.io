Chapter 5912: The Destroyed Tan Clan

“Can I take Wen Xue’s life if she does something detrimental to us?” Chu Feng asked Zi Ling.

“I’ll kill her myself if she tries to harm you. That applies not just to her but everyone else,” Zi Ling earnestly replied.

To her, anyone who dared to harm Chu Feng deserved to die, even if she owed the other party a favor.

“Big brother Chu Feng, do you think that Wen Xue hasn’t changed?” Zi Ling asked.

“No, I’m just asking. I do think that Wen Xue has changed,” Chu Feng replied.

“For the better?” Zi Ling asked.

“Mmhm.”

“I think so too. I don’t think she’s a bad person.”

“Let’s not think too much into it now. Let’s do what we must first.”

With that, Chu Feng and Zi Ling began making their way toward the key fragment.

They weren’t near the key fragment yet, but Chu Feng still proceeded warily, knowing that he was up against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. He was worried that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion might set up obstacles along the way, and it would be terrible if they discovered his presence.

Surprisingly, the journey was smooth sailing. They didn’t run into any formations or obstacles. However, as they got close to their destination, Chu Feng noticed that there was an increasing number of people traveling in the same direction.

These people had caught wind of some news and were rushing to watch a commotion—it seemed like a clan had been massacred.

Chu Feng made haste, and they soon saw a huge city enveloped by flames. They were still a distance away from the city, but an overwhelming stench of blood could already be smelled.

This was the city where the key fragment was.

This city belonged to the Tan Clan, and most of its clansmen had been in the city when the tragedy struck, so there were no survivors at all.

Many people were gathered outside the city, but most of them were only there to watch the commotion. Nevertheless, the situation inside the city was so terrible that even outsiders felt sorry looking at it.

“Who could be so evil?” Zi Ling clenched her jaws in anger.

She had seen many massacres in her journey, but she felt seething rage each time she saw innocent children getting massacred before they had a chance to see the world.

“Is it the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s doing?” Zi Ling asked, though her voice was hesitant as she doubted if a power like that would do something so underhanded.

“We can’t eliminate that possibility,” Chu Feng replied.

Whether it was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion or the other galaxy overlords, there was much bloodshed behind their current position of power. More often than not, orthodox sects could be even more vicious than so-called unorthodox sects.

“This is too cruel! I don’t think the Tan Clan has offended anyone. Why did such a disaster suddenly befall them?” A fatty flew over and frowned at this sight.

“Their treasures are all gone; it must have been a robbery. What reason is needed for a robbery? It has always been the survival of the fittest in the vast world of cultivation, no?” his companion replied.

“But I never heard that the Tan Clan has anything valuable.”

“Who says the Tan Clan doesn’t have anything valuable? Have you forgotten about their formation?”

Chu Feng and Zi Ling listened closely to the conversation.

From that, they learned that while the Tan Clan wasn’t strong, they had a long history. It was rumored that in the earlier years of the present era, the Tan Clan had an esteemed guest who helped them prosper for a short while. The esteemed guest left a formation for them.

The formation was a unique one. It wasn’t big, but it couldn’t be moved or activated. No one knew what was inside the formation.

The esteemed guest told the Tan Clan to take care of the formation, saying that a fated someone would eventually claim possession of it. That had been the Tan Clan’s inside secret for a long time, as such things could potentially bring trouble. Smart people would have known to keep it hush.

But a forest too big was bound to have all kinds of birds.

The Tan Clan had wastrels who harbored dissatisfaction with their clan and intentionally spread their secret to outsiders.

Due to that, a powerhouse in this realm once offered to protect the Tan Clan, but in truth, the powerhouse coveted the formation too and wanted to come into contact with it. However, they found that even though the formation existed, they couldn’t sense the aura of a treasure from it.

The Tan Clan wasn’t strong even at its peak, so the powerhouse thought that the formation was unlikely to contain anything formidable. Thus, they gave up on the Tan Clan.

That being said, some people thought otherwise and continued to covet the formation. The Tan Clan faced many difficulties due to it. No one had been able to breach or take the formation away, but attempts had nevertheless caused casualties for the Tan Clansmen.

That compelled many Tan Clansmen to move elsewhere. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Fortunately, the rumors about the formation died down over time, as many people began to believe there was nothing of value inside. The Tan Clan enjoyed peaceful days thereafter, and some who left returned.

The Tan Clan didn’t grow strong, but it slowly grew populous once more.

Yet, such a tragedy suddenly struck.

“This is tragic. They are unfortunate to have stumbled upon such merciless people after so many years,” someone remarked.

“It’s gone! That formation is gone!” an old man inside the city exclaimed.

Many spectators rushed over to take a look. Chu Feng flew over there with Zi Ling as well.

The voice was coming from an underground chamber. The underground chamber was empty, and an old man was standing in there.

More and more people arrived.

From their discussions, Chu Feng learned that the old man was on close terms with the Tan Clan. He was once permitted entry here, and according to him, this was where the Tan Clan’s formation was located. He and many others had tried deciphering it, but it was to no avail.

“The culprit must have been after the massacre.”

“Let’s scatter. We can’t afford to get involved in this.”

Many spectators were fearful to learn that the formation was gone, and they hurriedly fled with pale faces. It was no exception for that old man too.

It was normal for them to be afraid.

Even the powerhouses of this realm were unable to do anything about the formation. It was unthinkable to them how powerful the culprit had to be to move the formation away. They were afraid that they would be implicated if they continued lingering here.

Within moments, Chu Feng and Zi Ling were the only ones left in the vicinity.

Those who were rushing here to watch the commotion also kept their distance upon learning that the culprit behind the Tan Clan’s massacre was not to be made light of.
