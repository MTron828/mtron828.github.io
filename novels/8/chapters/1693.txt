MGA: Chapter 1693 - Extremely Dangerous Location

“Since senior does not wish to say who he is, junior will not ask anymore. However, since senior said that my life is destined to be filled with calamities and that you have come to help me, may I know how you’re going to help me?”

From the gaze of this old man, Chu Feng felt that he had not come to cause him harm. Instead, he seemed to have really come to help him. Thus, Chu Feng relaxed his guard.

Let alone, before someone like the old man before him, even if he didn’t lower his guard, it would still be useless. If the old man wished to kill him, he would not be able to escape death.

“Calamities from heaven cannot be avoided. Calamities caused by humans cannot be escaped from. Your calamities are from heaven. As for why, it’s because your talent is too exceptional. With exceptional talent, you will inevitably cause others to become jealous of you and see you as a threat.”

“It is people’s nature to fear what they are uncertain of. To them, the best method would be to eradicate the thing that threatens them. That is why you are destined to be met with calamities one after another. Because of your talent, you are destined to have people who want to eliminate you,” The old man said.

“Senior, please inform this junior how I can dissolve these calamities of mine,” Chu Feng asked respectfully.

“One cannot avoid calamities. Instead, one must meet them head-on. One cannot flee from disasters. Instead, one must meet them head-on.”

“You can comprehend the meaning behind those words yourself,” The old man said with a smile.

“It’s here,” Suddenly, the old man’s gaze flashed. Then, he abruptly swung his fishing rod. The fishing rod turned into a ray of light and flew toward the sky.

“Hulala~~~”

In an instant, waves of water surged toward the sky and the earth started to tremble. A sea monster a hundred meters long with the size of a small mountain was pulled out from the lake. It had its stinky mouth wide open as it tried to devour the old man.

Once this sea monster appeared, a ferocious oppressive sensation swept forth. Even though Chu Feng and Du Wanwu were very far away from the lake, they were still knocked several miles away by that oppressive might before they were able to steady themselves.

“It’s a poisonous substance from the lake. It is formed by poison gas and possesses no intelligence. All it knows is killing.”

“It, it is actually a Martial Emperor!!!” Upon seeing that monster, Du Wanwu cried out in alarm.

The reason for that was because the sea monster was even more powerful than he had anticipated it to be. It was not a peak Half Martial Emperor, and was actually a Martial Emperor. Even though it did not possess intelligence, it possessed the strength of a rank one Martial Emperor.

At this moment, it was not only Du Wanwu who was in shock. Chu Feng’s gaze had also become extremely serious.

After all, the poisonous substance was truly too frightening. Not only was it very powerful by itself, it also possessed the geographical advantage when inside the poison lake. The poison energy within the lake was all being used by it.

However, even with this being the case, that old man still had an unchanged expression without the slightest bit of alarm.

“In.”

That old man suddenly shouted with a low voice. Then, that enormous poisonous substance actually disappeared. At the same time, that old man had also disappeared.

Even the surface of the lake that had waves rolling about returned to the way it was before. It was as if nothing had ever happened. It was strangely tranquil.

“That poisonous substance cannot leave the Five Poisons Mountain. However, it is capable of leaving the poison lake. The two of you will have to pass by this place. Even if you are to avoid the poison lake, it will still attack you two.”

“I have helped you two with this calamity. As for what remains, you two will have to take care of them yourselves.”

Even though the poisonous substance and the old man had both disappeared, the old man’s voice sounded again. Merely, after his voice was heard, he no longer appeared. No matter how much Chu Feng expressed his thanks, that old man would not answer.

“Chu Feng, who was that person?” Du Wanwu asked.

“I don’t know. I don’t recognize him,” Chu Feng said.

“He’s very powerful. He was able to easily take care of that rank one Martial Emperor-level poisonous substance. If it wasn’t for him, we might really have become things inside the stomach of that poisonous substance.”

“However, why would he help you all of a sudden?” Du Wanwu looked to Chu Feng with a complicated expression. Ever since they had left the Poison Demon’s Valley, his impression of Chu Feng had been changing nonstop.

Firstly, Chu Feng was very mature, and would think matters through with careful consideration and execute things according to the way he thought. This had caused admiration in Du Wanwu, making him feel inferior to Chu Feng.

And now, there was actually such an expert helping Chu Feng clear the path for him. This caused him to have a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng yet again. In terms of background, Chu Feng seemed to possess a much more robust background than him.

This also caused Du Wanwu to be a bit worried. After all, Chu Feng had been threatened to help him. With the way their Du Clan had threatened Chu Feng, and with the strength that Chu Feng possessed, if he wanted to retaliate against their Du Clan, they would likely have to bear an enormous consequence.

“What you asked is also what I wish to know. Forget about it, let’s stop thinking too much. Right now, it is more important to retrieve the Gu. After all, the Black Fiend could come at any time. We must return to the Luo Family as quickly as possible,” Chu Feng smiled lightly and then proceeded onward.

Actually, at this time, Chu Feng was feeling very joyous. The reason for that was because Chu Feng knew that the appearance of that mysterious old man was not a coincidence.

Since that old man was willing to help Chu Feng once, it would be very likely for him to help Chu Feng again. With that mysterious old man’s strength, not to mention the Black Fiend’s shrimp soldiers and crab generals, even if the two leaders of the Black Fiend were to show themselves, they would likely not be a match for that mysterious old man.

Even though Chu Feng could not guarantee that that mysterious old man would help him again, he knew that there would still be a chance for him to do so. As long as there was a chance, it would make him feel a trace of hope. As such, how could Chu Feng not feel joy?

Suddenly, Du Wanwu asked, “Chu Feng, what he said earlier, ‘that one cannot avoid calamities. Instead, one must meet them head-on. One cannot flee from disasters. Instead, one must meet them head-on.’ What did he mean by that?”

“It’s very simple. For example, if someone is to try to kill you, you cannot flee blindly. Instead, you must take care of the people that want to kill you.”

“As the saying goes, one must eliminate the root in order to eliminate the weed. That is what he meant by those words,” Chu Feng said.

“It would seem that he really does plan to help you,” Du Wanwu said.

“Why do you say that?” Chu Feng asked.

“I can tell that you possess enemies. However, with your current strength, you are evidently not powerful enough to handle your enemies. However, he said that he would help you. Doesn’t that mean that he will handle your enemies for you?” Du Wanwu said.

“Let’s hope that to be the case,” Hearing what Du Wanwu said, Chu Feng smiled.

Chu Feng did not know about the origin and purpose of that mysterious old man. Regardless of what reason he had for helping him, regardless of what goal he had in helping him, Chu Feng still hoped that he would really be willing to help him. The reason for that was because, at this moment, Chu Feng really needed the backing of Martial Emperors.

Chu Feng and Du Wanwu continued onward according to the map’s directions. Finally, they reached the opening of a cave. This cave opening was very hidden. If they didn’t have the map, they would simply not have been able to find it.

Furthermore, even if one were to find the cave, if one did not possess the key in Du Wanwu’s hand, one would not be able to enter the cave either. After all, the Poison Demon was a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. The methods of the Poison Demon were something that even Chu Feng would find very difficult to dispel.

After entering the cave, a very dense poison gas immediately assaulted Chu Feng and Du Wanwu. Even though Chu Feng possessed a body immune to poisons, he still started to frown.

This place was too frightening, was it not? Likely, the word ‘eerie’ would be unqualified to describe this place. Only the word ‘hell’ could describe this place more fittingly.

Corpses were everywhere. Furthermore, they were not bones, and were instead rotten corpses. They were not only human corpses. More than human corpses, there were a lot of monstrous beast corpses, frightening monstrous beasts. The largest among them was a rotten corpse a thousand meters long, with a size akin to a mountain, lying in the distance.

That was a Martial Emperor-level monstrous beast. Furthermore, it was no ordinary Martial Emperor. Likely, it was a monstrous beast king that had ruled over a region. Before dying, it should have been extremely powerful.

Chu Feng didn’t know how the Poison Demon had managed to make these corpses keep from turning into bones after fifteen thousand years. However, Chu Feng knew that these corpses had no trace of energy in them. Even their source energy had been completely absorbed.

Chu Feng was able to sense that there was a power that was still devouring everything in their surroundings. In fact, after Chu Feng and Du Wanwu entered this place, that power turned into large, invisible hands that wanted to rip Chu Feng and Du Wanwu to pieces so that it could devour their organs, split apart their dantians and snatch their cultivations. That power was planning to devour Chu Feng and Du Wanwu alive.

If it wasn’t for the fact that both Chu Feng and Du Wanwu were resistant to poison, this power would have been capable of causing the two of them to die on the spot. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

That was a very sinister power. It originated from the depths of this vast underground cave. All of the frightening scenes in this place were caused by that sinister power.

This place was an extremely dangerous location.
