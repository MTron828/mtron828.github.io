Chapter 4407: Old Rascal

After a long journey, Chu Feng finally returned to the Holy Light Galaxy, and the first place he headed to was the Dragon Clan.

In order not to worry the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he chose to wear the robe and mask which the Lady of Dao Sea had given to him in order to conceal his appearance.

Typically speaking, such a suspicious-looking Chu Feng should have been taken down as soon as he arrived at the Dragon Clan via the teleportation formation, but fortunately, in order to grant Chu Feng the ease of access in and out of the Dragon Clan, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had given Chu Feng a special token when he left back then.

With the token in hand, the clan members of the Dragon Clan were able to identify Chu Feng right away. Not only did they not make things hard for him, but they even respectfully led Chu Feng in too.

From them, Chu Feng heard a lot about the current circumstances surrounding the Dragon Clan.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had recovered from his injuries during this period of time. Yu Ting, who had been waiting outside for them, was granted entry into the Dragon Clan too.

As for Long Xiaoxiao, while most people in the Dragon Clan still didn’t know about what happened the other day, she appeared to be doing quite well in recent days.

Chu Feng’s guess was that she should have finished assimilating the Dragon Vein Source by now.

One thing that caught his attention was that Long Xiaoxiao and Yu Ting were currently at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s accommodations.

Upon arriving at a certain boundary, the clan members who were with Chu Feng suddenly halted their footsteps. They couldn’t proceed any further because the land ahead of them had been demarcated as a forbidden area.

Other than the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Long Xiaoxiao, and the Supreme Elders, no one in the Dragon Clan was permitted to step into this land.

Of course, due to the special circumstances surrounding Chu Feng, he was allowed to enter this forbidden area too.

The forbidden area spanned over a huge swathe of land, but fortunately for Chu Feng, it didn’t take him too long to spot the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Yu Ting’s silhouettes in a garden.

He could sense spirit power coming from within the garden.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was currently teaching Yu Ting how to construct formations, and based on their interactions, Chu Feng could tell that they had been getting along well with one another during this period of time.

What that left Chu Feng feeling particularly relieved was that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist appeared to be doing far better than how he was when Chu Feng left the Dragon Clan.

With this, there should be no need to worry about the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s injuries relapsing, especially since Chu Feng had brought back the item that was needed.

“You’re back.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was the first one to notice Chu Feng, and before Chu Feng could speak, he had already pointed to the sky where Chu Feng was at.

Hearing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words, Yu Ting quickly looked toward the sky and spotted Chu Feng too.

While the reserved young lady didn’t say anything after seeing Chu Feng, the slight smile on her face was more than enough to express her current emotions.

“Why are you wearing a mask?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked with a smile after seeing Chu Feng’s current appearance.

He immediately realized that something was amiss.

“I went through a few things. Wearing a mask will be beneficial to me,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

Swoosh——

But barely after saying those words, a figure suddenly flashed across Chu Feng, and before he could react, the mask on his face was already taken off.

It was Long Xiaoxiao. She had a gleeful look on her face when she successfully took off Chu Feng’s mask.

“Little benefactor, you started learning how to put on a mysterious front after going on a trip, hm? But don’t you think that your mask looks a little...”

As Long Xiaoxiao spoke, she turned around to look at Chu Feng, and what she saw left her petrified on the spot.

It took her a while before she was able to bring herself to ask, “L-little benefactor, what’s wrong? Who hurt you?”

“Chu Feng, how did you land in such a state?”

Even Yu Ting had flown into the air to take a closer look at Chu Feng’s current condition.

They were both extremely concerned about Chu Feng, especially Long Xiaoxiao. Her usually cheerful eyes were glistening with tears of unease. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It was not that they were making a big fuss out of nothing, but Chu Feng’s current state was indeed rather frightening. It looked as if he had been through severe torture.

“I’m fine. I was the one who did this to myself. I’ll recover after some time. Don’t look at me like that, I’ll recover over time. It’s not as if I’ll be like this forever,” Chu Feng replied with a nonchalant tone.

“Liar! Who would believe your words? Who in the world would do this to himself?” Long Xiaoxiao exclaimed in disbelief. She turned to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and said, “Elder, please hurry up and take a look at little benefactor to see what’s wrong with him!”

Long Xiaoxiao was really nervous that she was fidgeting all over.

“Feng’er, come with me,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he rose to the sky.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng quickly followed him.

As for Yu Ting and Long Xiaoxiao, they understood that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist wanted to have some private time with Chu Feng, so they tactfully chose not to tag along.

Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist flew all the way to the side of a peaceful river valley before finally landing to the ground. Following that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist quickly set up a formation to prevent anyone from spying or eavesdropping on them.

“Was it the doing of the item?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked Chu Feng.

“No, it’s not that. I accidentally fell into a remnant and got myself like that,” Chu Feng replied.

“Tell me the truth,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words had become more severe than before.

He could tell that Chu Feng was lying.

On the other hand, Chu Feng realized that it would be impossible for him to hide the matter from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, so he told him the truth.

Of course, he also explained to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist how his cultivation rose to rank four Utmost Exalted level too.

“I didn’t think that you would encounter so many matters on your trip there, but it’s a good thing that you managed to advance your cultivation by so much over there. It’s can still be somewhat considered a blessing in disguise.

“But no matter what, it’s still a fact that you ended up in such a state due to me. I owe you a favor for this. Rest assured, I’ll surely find a way to restore your original appearance. It would be a great sin if I were to get in the way of my dashing disciple from flirting with girls?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist remarked with a wrinkly smile.

Despite the seemingly cheerful look on his face, there were still hints of guilt and pain in his eyes.

“Master, there’s no need for such formalities between us. Will this item be able to treat your soul?”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the sealed black streak and passed it over to Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“What formidable mean! It looks like the Lady of Dao Sea that you spoke about is really an expert,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist exclaimed as he took the sealed black streak over.

“Master, will it work?” Chu Feng asked again.

Right now, the only thing on his mind was whether the black streak could really cure the Ox-nosed Old Daoist or not.

“Of course! This item has already reached maturity, and the Lady of Dao Sea has erased the danger that the item would potentially pose to me while assimilating it. There won’t be any trouble to use it at all,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

“I’m relieved!” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was finally able to put his heart down.

“Speaking of which, master, has Long Xiaoxiao managed to fully assimilate with the Dragon Vein Source yet?”

Chu Feng had asked this question because he realized that Long Xiaoxiao had regained her usual vivaciousness, and she was even able to remove his mask with ease.

One must know that Chu Feng was no longer the same as he was before. His cultivation had already reached rank four Utmost Martial level.

While Long Xiaoxiao did catch Chu Feng off-guard, the fact that she was able to take off his mask so easily still meant that she had managed to advance her cultivation considerably.

Based on what he saw, he felt that Long Xiaoxiao should have finished assimilating the Dragon Vein Source.

“She’s pretty much done assimilating it, and her cultivation has also risen to rank six Utmost Exalted level too. This is just a start for her though. She’ll rise far beyond that in time to come.

“If she were allowed to continue growing at this rate, it’s very possible that the Holy Light Galaxy might be renamed as the Dragon Clan Galaxy in time to come.”

Through the words of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, it was apparent that he believed that Long Xiaoxiao held the potential to tilt the balance of power in the Holy Light Galaxy.

Chu Feng was a little overwhelmed to hear those words. He didn’t think that he and his master’s arrival here would actually bring such a change to Long Xiaoxiao’s fate.

This was a fortuitous encounter that any cultivator would be delighted to have.

“That lass really owes everything she has right now to you. If not for you, I wouldn’t have bothered to help her either. I bet that she’s more than willing to betroth herself to you to repay the debt of gratitude she owes you. Didn’t you see how pained she was when she saw your current state? She was nearly going to burst to tears!” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said cheekily.

“Master, you shouldn’t crack such jokes. You also know that I don’t harbor that kind of feelings toward Xiaoxiao,” Chu Feng replied.

“Aiyo, my silly disciple. Feelings can be cultivated over time! Besides, Long Xiaoxiao is quite a looker herself, and with her current talent, she’ll be able to help you a lot in the future. What else are you asking for?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist commented as he nudged Chu Feng.

His current attitude could be summarized with four words—an old rascal.
