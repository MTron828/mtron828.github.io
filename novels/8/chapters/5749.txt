Chapter 5749: The Arrogant Youth

“Why are you so shameless?” Huangfu Jiangyao was infuriated.

“Who are you calling shameless? Watch your mouth! If you have a problem with that, we can step into the dueling ring and fight it out. The loser shall kill themself,” Little Fishy said.

“What? Kill themself? Isn’t that too much?”

The crowd was taken aback. Even though Huangfu Jiangyao was at fault for arbitrarily testing Chu Feng’s cultivation level, there was no need for them to go as far as to put their lives on the line.

Xianhai Yu’er’s temper was truly frightening.

A flicker of hesitation flashed across Huangfu Jiangyao’s face. He would have taken the bet had it been anyone else, but he could tell from the earlier strike that Xianhai Yu’er was going to be a difficult opponent. He wouldn’t mind sparring with her, but he wasn’t confident of beating her in a fight for their lives.

In any case, he panicked.

“It’s just an item to gauge one’s cultivation. Let him have it,” another voice echoed.

Four silhouettes dressed in clothes similar to Huangfu Jiangyao’s walked out of the white fog. They were all carrying similar wooden boxes.

The first one was a seemingly average man with nothing particularly outstanding about him, be it his height, face, or disposition. If not for his clothes, the crowd wouldn’t have even spared him a second glance.

The second one was a brawny man boasting a height of nine meters. He looked like a giant compared to his other three peers, who were only as tall as ordinary humans.

The third one was dashing with an outstanding disposition.

The fourth one was a white-haired man.

The one who spoke earlier was the white-haired man.

“Young master, that is…” Huangfu Jiangyao looked at the white-haired man.

“Give it to him,” the white-haired man said.

“All right.” Huangfu Jiangyao nodded before taking his place beside the white-haired man.

The crowd realized that the white-haired man was likely to be the leader of the group.

“Thanks for your generosity,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you able to use it even if I give it to you?” the white-haired man asked.

Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng formed a hand seal. The rock soon glowed and enveloped him, revealing his cultivation as a rank three Half-God.

The five Huangfus were stunned. They thought that Chu Feng wouldn’t be able to invoke the treasure as he didn’t know the invocation method. They didn’t expect Chu Feng to decipher the method on his hand within such a short period of time.

“Thanks,” Chu Feng said as he stowed the rock into his Cosmos Sack.

“I was previously curious about your Heavenly Bloodline, but it’s disappointing how your cultivation is only at rank three Half-God level,” the white-haired man sighed.

“I see. I’m pleased about the rock you have given me though,” Chu Feng replied casually.

However, Little Fishy was displeased by that remark. “So what if he’s at rank three Half-God level? He’ll still beat you into the ground.”

The white-haired man looked at Little Fishy and Xianhai Shaoyu in disdain before remarking, “You’re Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Yu’er, right? I heard about capabilities, but to be honest, I wouldn’t have come to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith if not for Chu Feng inducing that phenomenon in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. None of you are a match for me,” the white-haired man said.

A huge commotion broke out.

Xianhai Shaoyu had built his reputation as the strongest junior in the world of cultivation, and Xianhai Yu’er had shown hints of what she was capable of too.

The crowd thought that Xianhai Yu’er would challenge the white-haired man after being insulted since she had charged at Huangfu Jiangyao earlier just for testing Chu Feng’s cultivation. They were convinced that she wouldn’t let an insult directed toward her and her brother slide.

Yet, Xianhai Yu’er was unfazed by the remark. She turned around, ran to Chu Feng’s side, and concernedly asked, “Big brother, are you fine?”

“I’m fine. He merely tested my cultivation. It’s a good deal receiving such a treasure in exchange for revealing my cultivation,” Chu Feng replied with a smile. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“That makes sense. Big brother, why did you come out? Are you here to fetch me to your residence?” Little Fishy asked.

“I was heading to Wang Qiang’s place to discuss some matters,” Chu Feng replied.

“I see.” Little Fishy pouted, though she wasn’t really angry. She grabbed Chu Feng’s arm and said, “Come, let’s go together.”

“What’s going on?”

The crowd couldn’t tell what was going on in Little Fishy’s mind. She looked as if she would murder Huangfu Jiangyao for testing Chu Feng’s cultivation, but she was unfazed when the white-haired man insulted her and her brother.

“Little sister Yu’er, you’re early,” Xian Miaomiao stepped out of the white fog and said.

“Big sister Miaomiao, it’s not early at all. I don’t think the cultivation ground is useful. I only held myself back from looking for big brother last night to avoid disturbing his cultivation,” Little Fishy said.

“I also don’t think that it’s useful. Why don’t we just stay at Chu Feng’s place instead?” Xian Miaomiao said.

“That’s what I’m thinking too.” Little Fishy nodded her head vigorously.

“Oh? Our thoughts coincide.”

Two more people appeared. It was Feng Ling dragging Long Muxi along.

Since everyone was here, Chu Feng decided to bring them along to look for Wang Qiang.

“It’s over? I thought they would come to blows.”

“No, wait a minute, what did they just say? Xianhai Yu’er, Xian Miaomiao, Feng Ling, and Long Muxi are going to stay with Chu Feng? Did I hear wrongly? I must be, right?”

“Why are they so attached to Chu Feng? He’s only a rank three Half-God level cultivator!”

The crowd couldn’t understand what was going on.

Several figures appeared on the square shortly after, causing the bustling square to fall silent once more. They were the prodigies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Thus far, they had never publicly appeared in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith as if they had agreed not to do so, but right now, they were appearing in an army of more than two thousand people. All of them were dressed in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s robes, though they didn’t reveal their spirit power.

They were far more imposing than any other powers in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

Three people stood at the forefront of the army.

On the left was a man with fair skin and feminine features. The crowd recognized him, for he was known as the most talented junior world spiritist in the world of cultivation—Ling Xiao.

On the right was a fair-skinned, beautiful woman who had a ferocious look in her eyes. She had disappeared from public view for many years, but the crowd could tell that she was the prodigy whose name was spoken alongside Ling Xiao a long time ago—Jie Baobao.

No one in the crowd had ever seen the man standing at the center, but no one else could have taken that position other than the famous Jie Tian.
