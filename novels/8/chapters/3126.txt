Chapter 3126 - Things Turning Bad

The aura of the undercurrent of the Immortal River could be felt from all directions. Chu Ping and the others were able to sense it clearly.

However, they were still following Chu Feng closely. They did not dare to travel at random.

The reason for that was because they knew very well that the aura of the undercurrent of the Immortal River that they were feeling was meant to confuse them.

If they were to sense the surrounding aura by themselves and search for the undercurrent of the Immortal River by themselves, they would likely not be able to find out where it was.

Only by following Chu Feng would they be able to find the location of the undercurrent of the Immortal River.

As for Chu Feng, he did not disappoint them. After they dived underground for a total of an hour, they arrived at a cave. The cave was very large. It was akin to an underground world.

In the central region of the cave was a flowing multi-colored river.

The cave was clearly in a pitch-dark location. However, the multi-colored river had illuminated the cave with multi-colored light.

The light was so dazzling that it completely lit the enormous cave.

Furthermore, standing there, one could sense the power flowing through that multi-colored river, and how alluring it was.

At that moment, the people present were all filled with endless excitement. They all knew that they would be able to obtain definite harvests from the multi-colored river.

“An undercurrent of the Immortal River, it really is an undercurrent of the Immortal River. Little brother Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. You actually really managed to discover a legendary undercurrent of the Immortal River.”

“What powerful natural energies. It is truly all thanks to little brother Chu Feng,” at that moment, Chu Ping was extremely excited. An ecstatic expression filled his face.

Chu Ping had trained in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm for a long time now. He had trained in the Immortal Rivers many times. However, this was the first time he had witnessed an Immortal River with such a dense amount of natural energies.

The legendary undercurrent of the Immortal River was truly not something that ordinary Immortal Rivers on the surface could compare to.

“I will go and call everyone here,” as Chu Ping spoke, he turned around with the intention to leave.

Seeing that Chu Ping was planning to leave, Chu Feng said, “Big brother Chu Ping, if you are to leave this place, I’m afraid that you will not be able to return.”

“Ah?” Chu Ping was startled upon hearing those words. He asked, “Why?”

“I know that you’ve already remembered the route here. However, you do not know that the surroundings were filled with auras meant to confuse us. You were merely unable to sense those auras.”

“You were only able to reach this place by following me. If you are to leave, it will be impossible for you to find this place again,” Chu Feng said.

“This...” Hearing those words, Chu Ping revealed a depressed expression.

Chu Ping was someone who placed the interest of their clan above everything else. Thus, even if he himself were to miss out on this great cultivation opportunity, he would still wish to share it with the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

However, he was now being told that it would be impossible for him to call the others over. Naturally, he would feel disappointed. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Big brother Chu Ping, this is fate. This is your fate, and also their fate. Why must you insist on making things difficult for yourself?” Chu Qing said with a smile.

He was urging Chu Ping to ease his mind and train here without worrying about the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

“Big brother Chu Ping, you’re already here. Thus, you should grasp this opportunity and train.”

“After all, this undercurrent of the Immortal River will only exist for a limited period of time,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well, I will not leave then,” Chu Ping smiled and nodded.

Chu Feng said, “I believe you all are capable of sensing the power of this undercurrent of the Immortal River. Its strongest power is actually in the central region. However, we must absolutely not enter that central region.”

“The power there is simply too strong. If one is to approach it, one will be sucked in by it. It is unknown where one will end up. However, one thing is certain: after being sucked into that power, one will definitely be sucked out of our Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.”

“Thus, even though the undercurrent of the Immortal River will not be able to bring any harm upon everyone here, if it so happens that people from other territories are to also discover this undercurrent of the Immortal River, conflicts will inevitably occur,”

“Right. Little brother Chu Feng, what you’ve said is very reasonable. Whilst we can train, we absolutely must not cross the border.”

“Otherwise, we will trigger a conflict between two powers. The consequences of that will be truly unthinkable,” Chu Ping said.

Afterwards, Chu Feng and the others entered the undercurrent of the Immortal River to train.

Upon entering the undercurrent of the Immortal River, even Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from gasping with admiration at how wondrous the power of the undercurrent of the Immortal River was.

That said, if Chu Feng wanted to gain martial comprehension to make a breakthrough, he must properly comprehend the martial comprehension in the undercurrent of the Immortal River.

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng soon entered a state of void. Gradually, Chu Feng began to ignore all the people and things in his surroundings.

“Little brother Chu Feng, this is bad!” Suddenly, Chu Shuangshuang’s voice exploded beside Chu Feng’s ear. She even shook Chu Feng’s body.

This immediately woke Chu Feng up from his state of void.

Chu Feng raised his head, and discovered that Chu Shuangshuang was not only grabbing onto his shoulder, she was also looking at him with a nervous expression.

“What happened?”

“Where are the others?”

Chu Feng immediately looked around upon waking up. It was only then that he discovered that only he and Chu Shuangshuang were left in the undercurrent of the Immortal River.

Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu have all disappeared.

“Little brother Chu Feng, little brothers Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu did not listen to your warning, and approached the central region of the undercurrent of the Immortal River.”

“The two of them ended up being sucked away by the power of the undercurrent. Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Ping and Chu Qing immediately rushed to save them. Unfortunately, the two of them also ended up being sucked away.”

“Right now, the four of them are being carried toward that unknown area, following the flow of the undercurrent,” Chu Shuangshuang said.

“Truly foolish!” Chu Feng cursed upon finding out what had happened.

He had clearly warned them earlier. Yet, they still decided to not listen to him.

If it wasn’t for the fact that Chu Qing and Chu Ping also ended up being carried away by the undercurrent Immortal River, Chu Feng would truly not bother with Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.

“Big sis Shuangshuang, wait for me here.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng leaped and entered the central region of the undercurrent Immortal River.

The moment he entered the central region, Chu Feng was immediately swept away by an enormous power. He began to rapidly float toward the depths of the undercurrent.

Seeing Chu Feng disappearing into the depths of the undercurrent Immortal River, Chu Shuangshuang’s heart tightened.

A trace of guilt appeared in her eyes.
