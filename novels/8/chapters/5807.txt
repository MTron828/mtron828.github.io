Chapter 5807: The Person I Befriended From the Very Start

Chu Feng chuckled. He grabbed a fistful of sand, stuffed it into Ling Xiao’s hand, and said, “Take a closer look. The sand contains everything you need to know.”

“The sand?” Ling Xiao widened his eyes in realization.

He finally understood why Chu Feng had immediately grabbed the sand to inspect it, as well as why Little Fishy did the same afterward. However, he was still unable to figure out what the secret behind the sand was.

Noticing Ling Xiao’s confusion, Chu Feng further elaborated, “Usually, we would look for clues via the geographical terrain, but sometimes, we need to think out of the box a little. You noticed that each grain of sand here contains a formation of its own, right? If they contain formations, it naturally means that they contain clues too. There’s nothing wrong with your eyes; it’s just that your focus is wrong.”

Ling Xiao focused his attention on the sand in his hand. He couldn’t believe that he had failed to figure out something as simple as this. The sense of disappointment only deepened when he verified that the method worked.

While he couldn’t decipher the formation as quickly as Chu Feng, he could most definitely figure out all of the clues with sufficient time.

“Let’s get moving. Be careful. Make sure to prioritize safety over all things else; it’s fine to fail,” Chu Feng instructed before making his move.

“All right, big brother. You take care too.” Little Fishy waved Chu Feng farewell.

It was only after Chu Feng disappeared that she turned around and said, “Let’s get moving too.”

The rest of the group was taken aback.

Little Fishy had always come off as an obedient little girl who needed protection, but as soon as Chu Feng was gone, her disposition changed. She suddenly felt like a leader overflowing with charisma. The others, despite being proud prodigies in their own rights, felt compelled to obey her, as if intimidated by her.

This changed the group’s impression of Little Fishy.

Some traits came naturally, such as Little Fishy’s leader aura. It was impossible for others to emulate it.

Jie Baobao flew over to Ling Xiao’s side and asked, “What’s wrong? Triggered?”

Ling Xiao was still observing the sand Chu Feng had passed to him even while traveling. “There’s a huge gap between us, not just in terms of senses but logical thinking too. I can hone my senses, but when it comes to logical thinking...”

“I get it. In other words, it’s just a gap in intelligence, as well as a gap in talent,” Jie Baobao said.

“I know that there’s a gap between us, but how can I bridge it? I don’t think it’s possible to do so by simply cultivating,” Ling Xiao said.

“It’s impossible to bridge the gap. It’s doomed to become bigger with time,” Jie Baobao replied.

“You... are being too direct. I feel even more jarred,” Ling Xiao replied with a sigh.

“It’s normal. Those weaker than us feel this way too. We are all born differently. It’s not as if our only value is to become the strongest of all. There are many different ways to find meaning in ourselves,” Jie Baobao said.

“You’re right, but those who walk the same journey as us all desire to become the strongest,” Ling Xiao said with an exceptionally long sigh. He knew that there was no way he could become the strongest world spiritist as long as Chu Feng was around.

...

Chu Feng flitted alone through the blood-colored desert when he abruptly screeched to a halt. He looked at the vast desert before him, but there was nothing in sight. Nevertheless, he knew that he was about to arrive at a remnant.

It would take some means to make the remnant appear, but he believed that Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao could pull it off. The two of them were top-notch world spiritists among the juniors, and even those from the older generation struggled to keep up with them.

The only flaw in them was that they were too inflexible, which was why he had Little Fishy follow with them. He thought they could figure things out as long as Little Fishy pointed out a direction for them when they found themselves in a spot.

Soon, the promised time arrived. Chu Feng flew forward, landed on a specific spot, and tossed out a formation he had prepared beforehand. He repeated this step a couple more times. In the end, he rose to the sky, formed a hand seal, and said, “Activate!”

Boom!

The earth shook, and an ancient palace rose from the blood-colored desert.

Time couldn’t be seen from the sand, but it was evident in the ancient palace. It was a building from the Immemorial Era.

Chu Feng entered the ancient palace and quickly figured out a way to clear it. He prepared a formation beforehand and patiently waited till the agreed time before activating the formation.

A brilliant pillar of light shot out from the ancient palace toward the distant sky.

Chu Feng stepped out of the remnant and saw the pillar of light converging with another similar pillar of light some distance away.

This meant Little Fishy and the others had succeeded. This was within Chu Feng’s calculation.

He knew that the difficult part about this trial was figuring out the correct method to decipher the formation. Employing the solution was not too tough as long as there were people to work with. For prodigies of their tier, it was unlikely they would err once they got the general direction right.

So, Chu Feng made his way toward the third remnant. Out of fear he would miss any details, he made sure to observe his surroundings with his Heaven’s Eyes while flitting across the desert.

Just as he was about to reach the third remnant, he noticed a hidden formation heading in his direction. So, he hurriedly halted his footsteps to carefully observe the hidden formation.

It didn’t take long for the hidden formation to come within his line of sight. There were many people hidden inside the hidden formation—they were all Pill Dao Immortal Sectmembers, and Chu Feng recognized at least three of them. He had met them in the Nine Souls Galaxy.

Jiang Kongping, Jiang Yuantai, and Jiang Taibai.
