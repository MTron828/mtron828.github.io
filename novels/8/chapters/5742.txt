Chapter 5742: What Bad Luck Meeting a Nasty Insect

“Wang Qiang arrived very early. He was already here when I arrived, but I didn’t meet him. However, I did hear some news about him. He’s quite a mysterious figure. He was recently taken in by the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Do you know what he looks like?” Chu Feng asked.

He was getting more and more convinced that this was the Wang Qiang he knew.

“I don’t know, but since he’s already here, it’s only a matter of time before we meet,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“I’m actually more curious about Yuwen Yanri,” Long Chengyu remarked.

“Is there something interesting about Yuwen Yanri?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yuwen Yanri’s grandfather is the incumbent Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master, whereas his father was the most talented cultivator in the world of cultivation two thousand years ago, towering above other cultivators.

“However, his father’s good days didn’t last long, as he later fell ill and had to recuperate for more than a thousand years. A few years back, we received news that his father passed away. No one could have thought that he would die just like that. After all, he was thought to be the next successor of the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion, and many thought that he would bring it to greater heights.

“It was said that Yuwen Yanri’s talent surpassed that of his father, but no one has seen him to date. Even within the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion, there were only a small handful of people who had seen him. He’s even more elusive than my big sister,” Long Chengyu said.

Long Muxi glanced at his younger brother upon hearing those words.

“But he has to be weaker than Wang Qiang, or else the Nine Heavens’ Zenith wouldn’t have invited Wang Qiang instead of him,” Little Fishy remarked.

“That’s hard to say. But speaking of which, what’s with those Huangfus? How is it that their results are better than Brother Shaoyu’s?” Long Chengyu asked.

Little Fishy was surprised, “Who? Who did better than my big brother?”

She didn’t participate in the test as she was invited straight into the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, so she didn’t know the situation there.

Long Chengyu shared the details concerning the ranking.

“Hahaha!” Little Fishy burst into laughter. She mischievously pointed her finger at Xianhai Shaoyu and said, “Big brother, aren’t you too embarrassing? It’s one thing if one or two people surpass you, but five people actually did better than you!”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Brother Shaoyu’s strength is known to be the strongest in the world of cultivation. He must have slacked off in the test,” Long Chengyu said.

Unexpectedly, Xianhai Shaoyu shook his head and said, “ I didn’t slack off.”

Both Long Chengyu and Little Fishy, who were mocking Xianhai Shaoyu earlier, stiffened up. She might have laughed at her brother earlier, but she wasn’t doubting his abilities.

“Brother Shaoyu, stop joking. How can anyone fare better than you if you were serious? Other than Brother Chu Feng, I can’t imagine anyone outdoing you,” Long Chengyu said with a smile.

He was certain that Xianhai Shaoyu was joking.

The latter smiled in response, choosing not to say anything more about it.

Little Fishy pressed her lips together as she fell into contemplation. She knew her big brother better than anyone else here, which was why she could tell that he wasn’t lying. This meant that her big brother was in sixth place despite having done his best.

Without a doubt, those Huangfus were not to be made light of.

It was a rare reunion, so there was no end to the topics for Chu Feng and the others to talk about. In the blink of an eye, the sky had already turned dark, but all of them decided to stay and have a hearty conversation till daylight.

By then, there was hardly anyone in the square. The Nine Heavens’ Zenith had prepared cultivation grounds that would activate at night for everyone in their respective accommodations, so most people had decided to head there to cultivate.

There was only one person standing in the square—Qin Shu. He was so angry that he wasn’t in the mood to cultivate at all.

“Hm?” Qin Shu’s eyes suddenly lit up.

He noticed the glowing red name, ‘Feng Ling’ going out, which meant that Feng Ling was leaving her accommodations. Soon, a beautiful figure emerged from the fog and stretched her back. Her casual demeanor looked adorable like a lazy cat.

“Miss Feng Ling,” Qin Shu rushed over and greeted her.

“You are?” Feng Ling looked at Qin Shu with curious eyes.

“I am Qin Shu, a disciple from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. I am Qin Xuan’s younger brother,” Qin Shu introduced himself.

Feng Ling had been to the last Nine Heavens’ Zenith, so Qin Xuan and the others had met her. Qin Xuan had told her that Feng Ling, the prodigy from the Bloodline Galaxy, was no ordinary figure, and it was best not to underestimate her.

For that reason, Qin Shu was exceptionally respectful to Feng Ling.

“Oh. I met your big brother before,” Feng Ling replied with an innocent and seemingly harmless smile.

“It’s wonderful that Miss Feng Ling remembers my big brother. I have been waiting here for you under my big brother’s instruction,” Qin Shu said via voice transmission.

“Does your big brother need something from me?” Feng Ling blinked her eyes as she spoke with an innocent voice.

“Miss Feng Ling, this Nine Heavens’ Zenith is very different from before. There are many formidable figures gathered here, though our greatest opponent is none other than Chu Feng,” Qin Shu said via voice transmission.

“Oh?” Feng Ling’s eyes narrowed upon hearing Chu Feng’s name, but she continued asking with an innocent voice, “Are you referring to Jie Ranqing’s child?”

“Yes, that’s him. He’s talented, but he’s a despicable and vicious man. I once met him in the Ancient Realm, and he’s particularly skilled in the art of deception. Miss Feng, you must take care not to be fooled by him, or else he might take advantage of you,” Qin Shu said.

“You have been waiting here to remind me of this?” Feng Ling asked.

“Not just that. The five Huangfus in this Nine Heavens’ Zenith are wild cards. The fact that they did better than Xianhai Shaoyu shows that they are not to be made light of. The three prodigies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion are also a force to be reckoned with. You should have heard of Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao, as well as Jie Tian. Xianhai Yu’er and Xianhai Shaoyu from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan are also dangerous figures.

“Given the threats present here, my big brother wishes to establish a partnership with Miss Feng Ling and support each other through this,” Qin Shu said.

“Is Chu Feng really here?” Feng Ling asked.

“Yes, he’s already here. He came here with Long Chengyu, and he appears to be on close terms with Xianhai Shaoyu too. Miss Feng Ling, birds of the same feather flock together. Those who are friends with Chu Feng can’t be good people either. We need to work together to deal with those black sheeps,” Qin Shu said.

“All right, I understand,” Feng Ling replied with a smile before returning to her accommodations.

Seeing how easily the innocent Feng Ling took in his words, Qin Shu revealed a sly smile and murmured, “She might be strong, but she’s too naive.”

On the other hand, after returning to her accommodations, Feng Ling mumbled under her breath, “I wanted to take a breather, but I ended up bumping into a nasty insect. What bad luck.”

She then looked at the sky with expectant eyes and said, “So, Chu Feng came in the end? It won’t be too boring here then.”
