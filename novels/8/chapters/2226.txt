Chapter 2226 - Quite Amazing

“Four World Spiritist Emperors, why are you all still not helping?” Daoist Three Swords looked to the Four World Spiritist Emperors with a very displeased expression.

“While you all might be willing to exhaust your power for that brat, the four of us are not,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.

“Very well, if Brother Chu Feng is able to help us break through that purple fog, those who have helped will all be able to pass through it. However, those who have not helped will not be allowed to pass,” Daoist Three Swords said.

“Daoist Three Swords, don’t you try to bully us excessively. While others might be afraid of your Immortal Sword School, we four brothers are not afraid at all!!!” The eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor spoke in a furious manner.

“Haha, the four of you brothers are not scared of our Immortal Sword School? Even your mother does not dare to say something like that,” Daoist Three Swords laughed mockingly.

Hearing those words, the Four World Spiritist Emperors clenched their fists in fury. Rage fumed between their gritted teeth, and flames of fury were burning in their eyes.

However, none of them dared to actually act out against Daoist Three Swords. They knew that they would definitely be no match for him.

Furthermore, what Daoist Three Swords had said was true too. Likely, even their mother would not dare to say that she was not afraid of the Immortal Sword School.

“Brat, what will you do if you are unable to break through that purple fog?” Suddenly, the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor turned his furious gaze to Chu Feng.

Being unable to do anything to Daoist Three Swords, he planned to vent his fury on Chu Feng.

As for Chu Feng, even though he was not someone fond of stirring up troubles, he was also not someone afraid of troubles. Faced with the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors deliberately making things difficult for him, Chu Feng would not be polite with them either. Thus, he replied, “What will you do if I am able to break through the purple fog?”

“What will I do? If you are able to break through the purple fog, I will give you an Incomplete Ancestral Armament.”

“However, if you fail to break through that purple fog, you must publicly kneel and kowtow to me to apologize. Then, you are to slap yourself a hundred times and scram immediately,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors shouted angrily.

“Very well. If I am unable to break through that purple mist, I will do as you said. However, I do not want an Incomplete Ancestral Armament if I am able to break through the purple mist.”

“Instead, I want you to publicly kneel and kowtow to apologize to me. Then, you are to slap yourself a hundred times and scram immediately,” Chu Feng said.

“You dare speak to me like this?” The anger on the face of the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor grew stronger.

“Why wouldn’t I dare to speak to you like this?” Chu Feng smiled mockingly. Then, he said, “Do you dare to take this bet or not? Speak frankly.”

“You!!!” Hearing those words, the expression of the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor grew tensed. He was actually scared.

He would not be afraid if it was merely a gamble with an Incomplete Ancestral Armament on the line. If he were to lose, then so be it. After all, he did not care about an Incomplete Ancestral Armament at all.

However, to publicly kneel and kowtow to apologize, and then slap himself a hundred times was something that he was incapable of doing.

“Big brother, forget about it. He is merely a nobody, there is no need for you to make things too difficult on him. You should just give him a chance,” Right at that moment, the third of the Four World Spiritist Emperors spoke.

“Very well, since my third brother is pleading for leniency for you, I will not bicker with you,” The eldest of the World Spiritist Four Emperors said.

“Heh...” Chu Feng laughed lightly at the words spoken by the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor.

It was not only Chu Feng who laughed. Many of the people present snickered in their hearts. They were all able to tell that it was not the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors that was sparing Chu Feng. Rather, he was scared of gambling against Chu Feng.

At that moment, the Four World Spiritist Emperors also felt very humiliated.

Thus, they were currently looking at Chu Feng with gazes of hatred that resembled invisible daggers. They wished that they could kill Chu Feng with their gazes.

However, they only dared to threaten Chu Feng with their malicious gazes, and still began to obediently instill their spirit power into Chu Feng’s spirit formation.

It must be said that the spirit power of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was truly strong. After they instilled their spirit power into Chu Feng’s spirit formation, Chu Feng’s spirit formation started to surge even more violently.

Everyone was able to sense that the power of Chu Feng’s spirit formation had grown to a very frightening level. At the same time, they began to worry. With how powerful the spirit formation had become, would Chu Feng really be able to control it? They felt that the spirit power contained in the spirit formation seemed to have already surpassed the limits of a Royal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Haha, big brother, that brat is going to fail. All of the world spiritists present are experts. All of their world spirit power is extremely strong.”

“With that much spirit power, the spirit power contained in that spirit formation is on the verge of exceeding the limits of Royal-level spirit power.”

“That brat will not be able to control it. The way I see it, not to mention that he will not be able to break through the purple mist, he himself will likely suffer an enormous backlash from the spirit power gathered,” The second eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors also noticed that the situation was amiss. Thus, he sent a voice transmission to his big brother rejoicing at Chu Feng’s incoming disaster.

“Humph, he’s reaping what he’s sown. Brothers, increase your spirit power. As long as that brat fails, I shall see what else Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket can say,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said through a voice transmission.

After receiving his voice transmission, his three younger brothers also began to frantically pour their spirit power into Chu Feng’s spirit formation. They wanted to make Chu Feng fail in controlling that spirit power and publicly humiliate himself.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng shouted, “Formation, activate!!!”

After that, his spirit formation flashed with light that filled the entire surrounding area. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. That spirit formation had exploded. The energy formed by the gathering of boundless spirit power broke through Chu Feng’s spirit formation and began to spread in all directions. Those energy ripples were going to swallow everything in the surroundings.

“Oh no!” At that moment, many of the people present revealed frightened gazes. The reason for that was because the power contained in that energy ripple of spirit power was truly extraordinary, and not to be looked down upon.

“Trash, you are unable to even properly control a spirit formation. Yet you dared to demand that we...” Upon seeing that sight, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors immediately rejoiced in Chu Feng’s misfortune, and began to rain curses upon him.

“This...” However, before he could finish his words, he turned tongue-tied and stood there in a stunned manner.

“Heavens, he actually!!!” At that moment, many of the people present were also stunned like the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

The explosion that they thought would have happened did not actually happen. Instead, the boundless spirit power was actually immobile in the air.

It was controlled, controlled by Chu Feng.

Suddenly, Chu Feng shouted, “Break!!!”

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

The golden light that covered the sky began to gather in one place like golden raindrops, that then turned into golden waves.

One wave after another, they began to crash into the purple fog.

“Quickly, look! That purple fog has started to gradually vanish!”

Seeing that scene, someone cried out in alarm. After that, practically everyone present revealed overjoyed expressions.

The purple fog that they were helpless against was actually gradually vanishing. As such, how could they not be overjoyed?

“How could this be? He actually managed to control such an enormous amount of spirit power?”

At the moment when everyone was overjoyed, the expressions of the Four World Spiritist Emperors became very ugly. The reason for that was because this wasn’t the result they had hoped for.

However, what they did not wish to happen the most was actually happening. The purple fog was being dispersed by Chu Feng’s spirit formation. Furthermore, the dispersed area was steadily increasing.

This not only brought enormous joy to the crowd, this also caught the attention of a gaze in the depths of Mount Cloud Crane.

It was a golden red-crowned crane. The crane stood high in the clouds as it looked down like a divine being overlooking mortals.

However, it actually revealed an astonished expression in its bright and expressive eyes.

Suddenly, the golden red-crowned crane actually spoke human speech.

“That brat, he’s quite amazing.”
