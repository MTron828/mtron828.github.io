Chapter 5843: Chu Feng’s Return

Looking at Zhao Gongyi, who was dripping snot and tears, Chu Feng suddenly asked, “You know Huangfu Shengyu?”

“I do, I do.” Zhao Gongyi hurriedly nodded.

“He has more spunk than you,” Chu Feng said before unleashing a martial power chain from his palm.

Pu!

The martial power chain skewered Zhao Gongyi from head to toe.

“GAH!” Zhao Gongyi hissed in pain.

The martial power chain was filled with reverse spikes, so it was exceptionally painful when it pierced through his body.

“Young hero Chu Feng, we were only obeying our clan’s orders. We haven’t hurt a single person from your Ancestral Martial Galaxy. We apologize for attacking this young miss, but we’re willing to compensate you,” the woman from the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan said fearfully.

The other four prodigies from the Ancient Era’s clans begged for mercy too. They didn’t want to end up in the same state as Zhao Gongyi.

“Oh. So it’s your clan who sent you here. You came here because your clan told you to do so. Are you going to die if your clan tells you to die?” Chu Feng eyed them coldly.

“This...” The juniors were stumped. They dared not answer the question.

“I don’t care whether you came of your own volition or your clan forced you here, but the Ancestral Martial Galaxy is not a place where you can come and go as you please. Since you’re here, you ought to pay the price for it.” A vicious glint flashed across Chu Feng’s eyes.

The martial power chain shot forth once more, and cries of agony ensued. This time, it had skewered the bodies of the other five prodigies.

“Big brother Chu Feng, there are more of them. The others are searching for the formation core,” Zi Ling reminded.

She could tell that despite Chu Feng’s calm exterior, his killing intent had been spurred from the moment he saw her hurt. He was only refraining from killing them because he was planning to make them suffer a fate worse than death.

But it wasn’t the time to torture these people now. There was more urgent business at hand.

“Don’t worry, Zi Ling. We can still make it in time.”

With a wave of his sleeves, Chu Feng revealed the formation on his palm. The six prodigies who had been skewered were dragged into the formation in his palm.

Then, he grabbed Zi Ling and began flitting toward the formation core. He didn’t need directions from Zi Ling at all; he had already confirmed the formation core’s location while he was landing.

...

The formation core was huge, spanning the size of a country. Even so, it was filled to the brim with the prodigies across the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. It didn’t matter what their cultivation level was, or whether they were from an Upper Realm, Ordinary Realm, or Lower Realm, they were brought here as long as they were outstanding in their respective realms.

There were at least billions of juniors inside the formation core, but all of them were in a fluster. They were protected by an immense protective formation, but the barrier was being bombarded by devastating martial power. They had never seen power as strong as this.

The other juniors from the six Ancient Era’s clans had found this place after some searching and embarked on their assault.

They might all be juniors, but the bombardment from the Ancient Era’s prodigies scared the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s juniors out of their wits.

“Isn’t there a restriction on this realm that prevents anyone who isn’t a junior from entering? How did such terrifying existences slip in?”

“Heaven, what in the world is that?”

“We’re dead meat, we’re dead meat!”

“I knew that we wouldn’t be a match for them. We’re the weakest cultivators in the entire world of cultivation. How can we possibly oppose the experts from the other galaxies? It’s no different from throwing an egg against a rock!”

Many of the juniors, both men and women, burst into tears.

“Everyone, calm down! They won’t be able to breach this protective formation. Pay them no heed and focus on channeling the formation. They won’t be able to do anything to us as long as they can’t get in!” Shengguang Jin’an voice echoed throughout the formation core.

To calm the juniors, he had stopped channeling the formation core, rose into the sky, and amplified his physique by more than ten thousand times via a formation. He wanted to catch everyone’s attention and calm their emotions.

Even so, his attempt did little to reassure the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s juniors.

The onslaught of the juniors from the Ancient Era’s clans was simply too fierce, and the might was unlike anything the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s juniors had ever seen before. The protective formation was intact, but it had started wavering under the focused attack.

The Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s juniors didn’t think the protective formation would last for long.

Little did they know that the juniors from the Ancient Era’s clans were panicking too.

“Why isn’t young master Gongyi and the others here yet?”

In truth, the juniors from the Ancient Era’s clans were unable to breach the protective formation, so they were waiting for the top prodigies of their respective clans to support them.

They had no doubt that the top prodigies of their respective clans could breach the protective barrier, and there was no way Zi Ling could stop them.

Boom!

The earth suddenly shook, and cries of agony echoed from the far distance. Countless people were swept into the sky like tree leaves in the face of a storm, and the commotion was swiftly approaching them.

A powerful surge of martial power was gushing over, wrecking everything that stood in its path.

The surge of martial power was so fast that it only took the blink of an eye for the juniors from the Ancient Era’s clans to be swept off. By the time the martial power dissipated, they fell onto the ground in a huge pile reminiscent of a mountain of weed. All of them were severely injured, unable to fight anymore.

Blood gushed down the mountain of bodies and dyed the earth red.

“Why is it suddenly so quiet?”

The Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s juniors didn’t know what was happening. They had only noticed that the assault outside had suddenly come to a halt.

“It’s Chu Feng! Chu Feng is back!” Shengguang Jin’an was the first to notice Chu Feng, and he shouted out loud.

“Chu Feng?” Chu Lingxi rose into the sky and spotted Chu Feng’s figure too. “It is him!”

A beaming smile appeared on her previously pale face.

Those who were acquainted with Chu Feng stopped channeling the formation core and rose into the sky too. They were a far distance away from Chu Feng, but they were still able to spot him when they rose into the sky.

“It really is Chu Feng. Chu Feng is back! There’s nothing to fear anymore! Chu Feng is back!”

“Brother Chu Feng is back! We’re saved!”

Kong Tianhui, Li Mu, and the others threw their hands into the sky and cheered. Their voices reverberated throughout the entire formation core. Those acquainted with Chu Feng and those who had only heard his name knew he was back.

“Chu Feng? Did he really stop the experts from the other galaxies?”

Most people in the formation core weren’t strong enough to see the situation outside, so they remained skeptical about the claims. They had heard about Chu Feng’s feats, but they thought he was only strong within the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Their enemies, however, were from the other galaxies, and the might they showed far surpassed what they had ever seen.

Thus, they wondered if Chu Feng could rival them.

“C-Chu Feng?”

Most of the juniors from the Ancient Era’s clans recognized Chu Feng, and some recognized Zi Ling as well. If Zi Ling is here, where are our young masters and young misses?

The smarter ones connected the dots and were scared into silence. However, there were ignorant ones who hadn’t heard of Chu Feng or his exploits too, and they blindly waited for their young masters’ or young misses’ arrival.

“Bastard, how dare you hurt us? Just wait till our young master arrives. He’ll slice you into pieces!” one of the ignorant ones howled. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

They still saw Chu Feng as no more than an ant despite being reduced to such a state.

“Young master? Are you referring to them?”

Chu Feng waved his sleeves, and six figures bound together by a martial power chain tumbled out.

The crowd took a closer look and saw that it was the top prodigies of their clans. Those who were arrogantly threatening Chu Feng a moment ago found themselves unable to utter a word.

They were the reinforcements the juniors of the Ancient Era’s clans had been waiting for, but they were in worse shape than them.
