Chapter 3762 - New Master

“Scram out of the Ancestral Martial Starfield?”

The crowd were all shocked upon hearing those words.

The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were doubting their ears, wondering if they had misheard things.

After all, if they were banished from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it would be an enormous shame and humiliation for their Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Where could they go? Regardless of where they decided to go, they would still become a laughingstock.

To leave on their own and to be banished were two completely different things.

“People like you aren’t qualified to stay in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“I will give you all a month to scram out of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. If there are still people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Starfield after a month passes, I will kill every single one I see," said Long Daozhi.

“City Master Long, please show leniency upon us. Please show leniency upon us.”

Suddenly, with a putt, a person kneeled on the ground. It was the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder, Linghu Yuhua.

Following her, many other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen also knelt.

Linghu Yuhua’s aged face was filled with tears.

Leading the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, she begged, “City Master Long, our Linghu Heavenly Clan has existed in the Ancestral Martial Starfield for generations.”

“I know that we’ve made an enormous blunder. But please give us a chance to make amends for our fault.”

“You can punish us however you want, but please do not banish us from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, our root and our home.”

“One must pay for one’s mistake. The fault of one’s clan chief shall be borne by the entire clan,” Long Daozhi said.

“Why are you all crying?! Our root is not with the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Instead, it’s with our Lord Clan Chief. Wherever he goes, we follow. Wherever he is shall be our root.”

Seeing the crying and begging Linghu Yuhua and others, there were Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that lashed out at them.

With that many people stood up again. However, there was a large portion of them that were still on their knees, still pleading to Long Daozhi.

“City Master Long, please, we beg of you, please show leniency upon us, please allow us to stay.”

Linghu Yuhua and the others were still begging and weeping bitter tears. Their grief-filled and heartbroken appearances did not seem to be fake.

Seeing that, Chu Feng was somewhat touched.

He discovered that when the Linghu Heavenly Clan was in fatal danger earlier, many people had knelt and begged for forgiveness out of fear.

However, those people that were begging for forgiveness earlier were not the same people begging for forgiveness at that moment.

The people that had begged for forgiveness before had done so for the sake of staying alive.

However, Linghu Yuhua and the others were begging because they did not wish to leave their home, did not wish to leave the place that their ancestors had taken root in.

“If you insist on staying, that’s fine too.”

“However, I have two demands.”

“Firstly, if you are to stay, you will only be allowed to stay in your Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Upper Realm. For ten thousand years, no one is allowed to leave.”

“I will dispatch people to monitor you for these ten thousand years. If I am to discover anyone disobeying that rule, they will be executed on the spot.”

“Secondly, Linghu Zhishi must scram out of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

Long Daozhi looked at Linghu Zhishi as he said those words.

“Ah?”

Hearing those words, the crowd’s expressions all changed.

They understood Long Daozhi’s intention.

He was giving Linghu Yuhua and the others a choice between two options. They could either leave with Linghu Zhishi, or they could stay in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. However, if they decided to stay, they would be monitored like criminals for ten thousand years.

Faced with the choice between the two, Linghu Yuhua and the others kneeling on the ground, all became quiet.

Their silence made Linghu Zhishi realize what their decision was.

Linghu Yuhua and the others had chosen to stay in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. They were not going to follow him.

“Elder Yuhua, you all are capable of making your own choices. I will not blame you.”

“However, a Linghu Heavenly Clan without me, Linghu Zhishi, will no longer be the actual Linghu Heavenly Clan.”

“Thus, I hope you all will not regret your decision today.”

After Linghu Zhishi finished saying those words to Linghu Yuhua, he waved his sleeve and left without a second thought.

As he left, a voice resonated throughout the sky.

“Those who still recognize me, Linghu Zhishi, as the clan chief, follow me.”

Once his words were said, a large amount of Linghu Heavenly Clansmen immediately followed him and left with him.

A small portion of the people kneeling on the ground hesitated for a while before standing up and following him as well.

However, the great majority of those kneeling, remained there. This included Linghu Yuhua.

“Elder Yuhua.”

Suddenly, a voice was heard. At the same time, a figure appeared beside Linghu Yuhua.

That person was Linghu Yueyue.

At that moment, Linghu Yueyue’s eyes were very red. Tearstains were visible on her face.

Although she was not crying, one could tell from her withered face that she had had a very tortuous experience.

That was understandable. After all, too many things had happened. To the Linghu Heavenly Clan, what had happened on that day, was simply an enormous shock. Even elders like Linghu Yuhua found it very difficult to accept, much less a person of the younger generation like Linghu Yueyue.

“Yueyue, you don’t have to try to persuade me.”

“I’m already very old, and will not be able to live for much longer. I only wish to be able to die in the clan,” Linghu Yuhua had a smile as she said those words.

Seeing the smile on Linghu Yuhua’s face, Linghu Yueyue seemed to have suddenly realized something.

“Senior, in that case, please take care of yourselves.”

After Linghu Yueyue finished saying those words, she turned around and followed Linghu Zhishi.

When she turned around, her gaze swept by Chu Feng.

There was deep resentment in her eyes. However, there was no killing intent.

Linghu Zhishi left leading the great majority of the people of the Linghu Heavenly Clan. However, the direction that they left in was not towards their Linghu Heavenly Clan. It could be seen that they’d chosen to directly leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

“You all should leave too,” Long Daozhi said to Linghu Yuhua.

“Thank you, City Master Long.”

After expressing their thanks, Linghu Yuhua and the others also got up in succession.

Soon, the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s army split into two, and all disappeared before Chu Feng and the others’ sight. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“City Master Long, a group cannot be without a leader. The starfield cannot be without a master.”

“City Master Long, please make a decision for us!”

Suddenly, someone half-knelt on the ground and bowed respectfully to Long Daozhi.

Immediately afterward, practically everyone present half-kneeled on the ground and bowed respectfully to Long Daozhi. Even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did the same.

Only Chu Feng, Gu Mingyuan, Chu Lingxi and a few others still stood there, stunned.

“Everyone, please get up.”

Long Daozhi raised his arm, and the people half-kneeling on the ground were all forcibly brought back to their feet.

“Everyone, I believe you all know very well that our Three Cities never involve ourselves in the matters of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. The only reason we acted today was because we were forced with no alternative. I, Long Daozhi, could not allow myself to look on as the Ancestral Martial Starfield was reduced to a domain of the All-heaven Starfield without doing anything.”

“However, our Three Cities made a pledge. That is, we will not rule over the Ancestral Martial Starfield,” said Long Daozhi.

“City Master Long, you cannot disregard us at a time like this...”

Hearing those words, the crowd immediately knelt again and began to beg Long Daozhi to lead them.

After witnessing his strength, they all hoped that he would rule the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

After all, if they had a ruler as powerful as Long Daozhi, their safety would be ensured.

However, if Long Daozhi and the Three Cities were all unwilling to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord, who else in the Ancestral Martial Starfield could possibly take on such a task, such a heavy responsibility?

They couldn’t possibly allow the various powers to fight over that position. If that were to happen, another bloodbath would occur.

The Ancestral Martial Starfield had already lost the Wuming Clan and the Linghu Heavenly Clan, their two strongest powers, in succession.

They could not afford to have another war.

Seemingly understanding what the crowd were thinking, Long Daozhi spoke again, “Actually, regarding the position of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s master, I already had someone in mind. Merely, I don’t know if everyone might agree with my decision.”
