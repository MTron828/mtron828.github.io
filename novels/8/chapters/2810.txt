Chapter 2810 - The Situation Turning Bad

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, Han Yu clasped his palms again.

Not long after he clasped his palms, another stream of white gaseous flames emerged from his body.

The white gaseous flames grew more and more numerous. As if wild and berserk, the flames raged on Han Yu’s body.

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, the white gaseous flames soared into the sky and took the form of an enormous, vivid and lifelike dragon.

The body of that enormous dragon was even larger than the enormous sword earlier. As for its aura, it too was even more powerful than the enormous sword from earlier.

This was also an Immortal Technique. Furthermore, the might of that Immortal Technique was evidently stronger than the enormous sword Han Yu had unleashed earlier.

Waves of oppressive might were being emitted by that enormous dragon nonstop. The oppressive might was sweeping toward its surroundings.

When the oppressive might swept toward Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword, Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword and Ancient Era’s War Axe actually started to tremble slightly.

It was as if they were scared.

Seeing this scene, many people from the Sacred Pellet Villa and the Immortal Armament Villa felt that the situation was bad.

Before Han Yu’s Immortal Technique even actually moved to attack Chu Feng, Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword and Ancient Era’s War Axe were already reacting in such a manner.

If Han Yu’s Immortal Technique were to actually land on Chu Feng, Chu Feng would likely suffer an extremely miserable outcome.

Unable to contain himself, the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Elder Ma Changchun shouted, “Han Yu, it is merely a spar, it would do when the outcome of the battle is determined. Little friend Chu Feng is already injured, yet you’re planning to use this sort of ability to attack him? Are you planning to kill him or what?”

He felt that Chu Feng would not be able to withstand the incoming attack. Thus, he wanted to forcibly end the battle so as to prevent Chu Feng from encountering a mishap.

“The outcome of the battle is still undetermined, why can’t I use this sort of attack?” Han Yu sneered. Then, he looked to Chu Feng and said, “If you are to admit defeat, I am willing to stop. However... you must kneel before Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi, kowtow and apologize to them.”

“This...”

Hearing those words, the expressions of the people from the Sacred Pellet Villa and the Immortal Armament Villa all turned ugly.

Han Yu was simply deliberately making things difficult for Chu Feng.

No one would normally do that sort of humiliating thing before all these people, much less someone as stubborn as Chu Feng.

“Han Yu, don’t you act overly excessive. It’s merely a sparring match, why must you demand that big brother Chu Feng kneel to them?” Li Xiang said.

“This is business between me and Chu Feng, since when were you all qualified to speak in this matter?” Han Yu cast his fiendish gaze toward Li Xiang.

Even though Li Xiang had grown much bolder now, his heart still shivered when he saw Han Yu’s ferocious gaze. Involuntarily, he took a step backward.

“Little friend Chu Feng, if you do not wish to continue fighting Han Yu, you merely need to say it. There’s no need for you to admit defeat, and even less of a need for you to apologize. With I, Ma Changchun, here, Han Yu will not be able to cause you any harm,” Elder Ma Changchun said to Chu Feng.

Upon hearing those words, Han Yu’s expression turned ugly. He turned to Ma Changchun and shouted, “This is something between Chu Feng and me... since when was there a need for you all to get involved with this?!”

“Our Sacred Pellet Villa is insistent on involving ourselves in this matter. Han Yu, what can you possibly do about it?”

As the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Elder Ma Changchun spoke, he took a step forward. He seemed to have an appearance of planning to support Chu Feng.

“You!!!”

Seeing this, Han Yu revealed a furious expression. However, the disparity in strength between him and Ma Changchun was simply too great. If Ma Changchun planned to force his way through, there was simply nothing he could do.

However, Han Yu was definitely not one to be trifled with either. Seeing that he was unable to handle Ma Changchun himself, he turned to the people from the older generation present and said, “Seniors, with how this Sacred Pellet Villa is bullying a person of the younger generation like myself, are none of you going to do anything about it?”

Once Han Yu said those words, many people began to whisper to one another. They were quietly discussing among themselves, seemingly calculating something. However, in the end, not a single person was willing to stand forth and speak on Han Yu’s behalf.

The crowd present all understood the situation before them. While Han Yu was not someone to be looked down upon, Chu Feng was not someone easily provoked either.

Even though Chu Feng himself declared that he was from an Ordinary Realm, how could someone from an Ordinary Realm possibly know the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and those heaven-defying secret skills?

Many people felt that Chu Feng was lying, that Chu Feng didn’t want to tell them the power behind him.

Because of that, they determined that the power behind Chu Feng must be a frightening existence.

Thus, unless they possessed enormous hatred with Chu Feng, no one was willing to involve themselves in that mess. Naturally, no one would be willing to speak for Han Yu.

“Little friend Chu Feng, let’s go.”

The Sacred Pellet Villa’s Elder Ma Changchun said to Chu Feng.

He felt that Chu Feng would not be able to continue, that the situation was extremely bad for him.

Thus, he wanted to forcibly end the sparring between Chu Feng and Han Yu. Even though this would mean that Chu Feng had lost the match, Chu Feng would, at the very least, not be seriously injured. As such, it would still be a worthwhile result.

“Senior, Chu Feng appreciates your kind intentions. However, the outcome of the battle between me and Han Yu is yet to be determined. How could I leave at a time like this?” Chu Feng said.

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd revealed a surprised expression.

The Immortal Technique Han Yu had unleashed was very powerful. Chu Feng had already revealed an appearance of being unable to withstand Han Yu anymore. Thus, how could he still be saying this sort of thing? Could it be that Chu Feng planned to continue?

“Little friend Chu Feng, do not force yourself. It is merely a sparring match. There is no need for you to put your life on the line,” Elder Ma Changchun said.

“But, if I am to give up like this, wouldn’t I have failed to live up to the help Senior Clan Chief provided me with?” Chu Feng looked to the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief as he said those words.

“Big brother Chu Feng, this is not an issue of sentiment and face. Rather, this Han Yu is clearly trying to use this sparring match as an opportunity to kill you,” Li Xiang urged Chu Feng.

“I know. Right now, I, Chu Feng, am in a disadvantaged state. However, since I’ve agreed to the match, we must continue until the outcome is determined. Even if I, Chu Feng, am to die in battle, I will still not hesitate,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, in that case, you’re planning to fight me to the death? Even if you are to die, you won’t allow others to interfere? Is that right?” Han Yu asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng said.

Han Yu was unable to contain himself, and shouted, “Great!” Then, he looked to Elder Ma Changchun, “Did you hear that? This is something between me and Chu Feng. You all are meddling in other people’s business.”

“You!!!” Hearing those words, the expressions of Ma Changchun and the others all turned very ugly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Han Yu, enough of your superfluous words. Allow me, Chu Feng, to experience the might of your Immortal Technique,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well. I will satisfy you,” as Han Yu spoke, his palms shot toward Chu Feng.

“Roar~~~”

The next moment, the enormous dragon, that Immortal Technique, let out a roar. Then, with overwhelming killing intent, it moved toward Chu Feng.

Seeing that, Chu Feng clasped his palms together and formed a special hand seal. After he finished forming the hand seal, the Ancient Era’s War Axe and Ancient Era’s War Sword that had protected Chu Feng within them actually started to shine brightly with golden light.

That said, even with this being the case, the crowd was still not optimistic for Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because, as the Immortal Technique enormous dragon grew closer and closer to Chu Feng, the crowd were able to see with clarity that Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe and Ancient Era’s War Sword started to tremble even more violently.

“Boom~~~”

Finally, that enormous dragon formed with an Immortal Technique landed on the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

At that moment, violent energy ripples burst forth like a volcanic eruption, wreaking havoc in all directions.
