Chapter 5610: Tuoba Yijian and Tuoba Tianxue

“Who are you?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’ll have to prove yourself qualified if you want to know who we are. Do you think you’re up for it?” the white-robed man asked.

“Careful, Chu Feng. They aren’t weaklings,” Eggy reminded, fearing that Chu Feng would be incited by their words.

“Don’t worry, Eggy. I won’t fall for such provocation,” Chu Feng said.

He was not so mentally vulnerable as to lose his composure in the face of such minor provocations. He wouldn’t recklessly go up against a more powerful enemy just because of a little bit of unhappiness he felt.

Throwing an egg against a rock was not bravery; it was foolishness.

Admittedly, Chu Feng had also acted foolishly in his younger days, but he would have lived decades in vain if he hadn’t learned from his lessons since then.

“I am not that curious about the two of you. I’m more curious about that,” Chu Feng said as he pointed at the boulder. He composedly pointed out his motive with a tone that showed neither anger nor fear.

“You’re indeed here for this item, but this boulder isn’t that easy to breach. At the very least, the two of us don’t have the ability to do so. How about this? If you are able to breach this boulder, you can take what’s inside and we’ll let you know our names. I just wonder if you’re capable of doing so,” the white-robed man said.

His tone was the same as before. It was not an overt display of hostility, but his lofty gaze indicated that he still doubted Chu Feng’s capability despite knowing that the latter was no ordinary person for having gotten this far.

“I hope that you are a person of your word,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Whether the white-robed man was making light of him or taunting him, this was not a bad deal for him, though he didn’t really require it. In the first place, it was doubtful if those two men were stronger than him, but even if they were stronger, he was confident that he could at least flee. Worse comes to worst, he had his protective formation to fall back on.

In any case, he started constructing his formation.

The blindfolded, black-robed man turned to look at Chu Feng, and the white-robed man widened his eyes in surprise. They thought that it was awfully reckless of him to make a move so quickly without spending some time to examine the boulder.

Soon, their astonishment deepened as they realized that Chu Feng was not constructing a spirit power formation but a martial power formation—an awfully simple one at that. It didn’t take him long to complete it.

“You’re already done?” the white-robed man asked.

“Yes, I’m done,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Are you joking with us? You think that formation of yours can breach this boulder?” the white-robed man exclaimed in disbelief.

Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng lowered the formation from the sky and fused it into the boulder.

“Heaven!”

The white-robed man widened his eyes in shock. The boulder that even True God level cultivators struggled to breach started cracking, and within a matter of moments, it had already shattered into countless fragments.

A glowing token floated out from within. It was clear at a glance that it was the highest quality token.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng immediately reached out to grab the token as he didn’t trust the two men. After all, there was no guarantee that the two men would uphold their promise.

In spite of his swift reaction, a figure still grabbed the token ahead of him. It was the white-robed man.

“Rank eight Half-God level?” Chu Feng was astonished.

He had known that the two of them were anything but simple, but he didn’t think that they would be this powerful. He stared at the two men, not bothering to grumble about the token getting snatched from him. He knew that it would be meaningless to protest about it.

The white-robed man examined the token and remarked, “This token is of the highest grade. How tempting. However, I, Tuoba Yijian, am a man with principles.”

Then, he tossed the token to Chu Feng.

“It looks like you are a man of your word,” Chu Feng said in surprise as he received the token.

“Of course. I, Tuoba Yijian, am an honest child who listens to my parents’ words. I never lie,” Tuoba Yijian said before turning to the blindfolded, black-robed man.

The latter caught the drift and clasped his fist. “I am Tuoba Tianxue.”

He was much more respectful than Tuoba Yijian.

Both of their attitudes were much better than before, a sign that they had acknowledged Chu Feng’s strength. Thus, Chu Feng clasped his fist and introduced himself, “I am Chu Feng. It’s a pleasure to meet the two of you.”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Chu Feng? Sounds familiar.” Tuoba Yijian pondered for a moment before saying, “Brother Chu Feng, you have sharp eyes. Why don’t we travel together since the strings of fate have brought us together?”

“Sure,” Chu Feng replied. “Which galaxy are you from?”

“Why do you ask this question? Do you think that we’re the juniors from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy who opened the Nine Realms Immortal Region? You’re thinking too much, Brother Chu Feng? We aren’t juniors. If anything, we were wondering if you are the one who opened the Nine Realms Immortal Region,” Tuoba Yijian said.

Chu Feng was indeed wondering if they were the ones who opened the Nine Realms Immortal Region, which was possible considering how strong they were. For instance, Tuoba Yijian was at rank eight Half-God level, and that was only his base cultivation level. On top of that, their auras were so well-hidden that Chu Feng couldn’t tell if they were juniors.

If they had attained such strength as juniors, it would come as no surprise that they were the ones who opened the Nine Realms Immortal Region.

Who could have thought that they weren’t juniors?

If they weren’t juniors, their feat of having reached rank eight Half-God level would have been much less impressive, though Chu Feng still thought that the two of them were not to be made light of. The fact that they had found this boulder said a thing or two about their capability.

Boom!

A loud explosion suddenly echoed, and the surrounding sandstorm dissipated. It didn’t take long for the sandstorm throughout the entire desert to die down.

This opened up Chu Feng’s line of sight, and he saw a towering mountain peak shaped like a sword ahead of them. A flame blazed at the mountain peak, dyeing the sky crimson. It looked like a torch situated in the middle of the world.

“It’s beginning,” Tuoba Yijian said as he took out a token with a flick of his wrist.

It turned out that he had obtained a token too, and it was of an extremely high quality. Tuoba Tianxue also took out a token of extremely high quality as well.

Chu Feng looked at the token in his hand and saw some changes with it.

“Let’s go. We’ll be able to enter that area with this token in hand,” Tuoba Yijian said as he prepared to make a move.

“There’s no need for that.” Chu Feng stopped them.
