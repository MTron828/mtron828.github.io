Chapter 2671 - Farewell

On the day, Chu Feng finally left his group of close friends. Only Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were with him.

Chu Feng was not preparing to leave the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Rather, before leaving the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he had a place that he had to go to first.

They arrived at the Zhou Heavenly Clan, formerly one of the strongest powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Merely, the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s palaces had already been destroyed. The mountains surrounding it had been flattened and the rivers dried out.

That place had turned into ruins. The former glory was gone from that vast land. All that remained... was an utter mess.

However, nine enormous characters were left behind in the sky.

‘This is the consequence of provoking Chu Feng’ [1.They’re 9 characters in chinese.]

Those nine enormous characters were shining brightly in the sky. They were like suns hanging in the sky, visible from over a hundred miles away.

They were like a decree from the gods signaling the end of the Zhou Heavenly Clan, announcing the result of offending Chu Feng.

“W-Wow, this is s-simply too a-aggressive, n-no? If s-someone d-dares to p-provoke you t-two in the future, I w-will do t-this too,” Wang Qiang said with a mischievous laugh as he looked at the words in the sky.

To the people from the Zhou Heavenly Clan, those nine characters were most definitely a nightmare.

However, to Wang Qiang, those nine characters were a pleasant surprise.

At the very least, he thought very highly of the person who had left those words.

Then, Wang Qiang looked to Chu Feng. He said, “S-Say, b-brother, do you r-really not know who helped you?”

Chu Feng shook his head. He was also pondering who wrote those nine characters while looking at them.

He wanted to know exactly who it was that had helped him from the shadows. That was his purpose for visiting the Zhou Heavenly Clan.

“Chu Feng, I feel that you should try using your Heaven’s Eyes to see if you can find any clues,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Eggy, you think that there are clues in the words?” Chu Feng asked.

“If there are no clues within the words, there will be no clues at all. This would only serve to prove that the person that left those words and exterminated the Zhou Heavenly Clan did not wish for you to know who they were,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded his head in agreement. Then, his eyes moved, and his expression changed.

His gaze became extremely sharp. It was as if he could penetrate everything, as if he could see through everything.

Before his Heaven’s Eyes, everything changed. Everything became clear.

“That is?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s gaze shifted. Then, he immediately soared into the sky and arrived between the characters ‘Chu’ and ‘Feng.’

If one were to inspect them with one’s naked eye, one would not see anything from those two characters. However, when viewing them with his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng discovered that a bracelet was hidden in both the ‘Chu’ character and the ‘Feng’ character.

Chu Feng recognized those bracelets. Those were the bracelets that Su Rou and Su Mei wore.

“Bang~~~”

“Bang~~~”

Chu Feng shot forth both his fists simultaneously. He shattered both large characters. However, those two bracelets were completely intact.

Chu Feng held the two bracelets in his palms. At that moment, his heart was trembling.

He knew that it had been many days now since those bracelets were hidden within the words. However, he was still able to sense Su Mei and Su Rou’s auras from those bracelets.

In fact, he was even able to distinguish the fragrances of Su Mei and Su Rou from the two bracelets.

He was absolutely certain that those two bracelets belonged to Su Mei and Su Rou.

“Lil’ Rou, Lil’ Mei, it was done by you?”

“No, it was the Moon Immortal. It’s her? She’s also in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?”

Chu Feng became extremely emotional when he thought of that. After all, apart from eliminating the Infant Soul Sect and proving himself, he had other important tasks in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

For one, he needed to find Su Rou and Su Mei, and then retrieve them from the Moon Immortal.

For the other, he needed to find Ya Fei, Murong Wan and Yan Ruyu, who had mysteriously disappeared.

He had been in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for so long now. During the entire time he was there, he had been making inquiries about them. However, he had not been able to scout out any information concerning their traces.

In the beginning, Chu Feng had thought that they had not arrived in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. However... he actually managed to discover Su Rou and Su Mei’s bracelets. This meant that the two of them had been there before.

“Chu Feng, look, there’s marks on those bracelets,” suddenly, Her Lady Queen called something to Chu Feng’s attention.

Chu Feng was so immersed in his complicated emotions upon discovering Su Rou and Su Mei’s bracelets that he did not carefully inspect them.

It was only after hearing what Her Lady Queen said that Chu Feng noticed that there were indeed marks on the two bracelets.

Once those two marks were placed together, they would form a symbol. It was a symbol that only world spiritists could see.

Chu Feng hurriedly held the two bracelets together. The reason for that was because he knew very well that those two marks were not present on the bracelets before.

Thus, someone must’ve purposely left those two marks on the bracelets.

Those marks were the clue.

“Buzz~~~”

Sure enough, at the moment when the two bracelets were placed together, a message flew out from among them.

Chu Feng extended his hand and grabbed. With that, the message entered his head.

“Chu Feng, rest assured, Su Rou and Su Mei are very safe right now. You do not have to worry about them.”

“I will be able to form my own body not long from now. At that time... I will personally bring the two of them back to you.”

This message was left behind by the Moon Immortal.

“Damn it.”

Chu Feng felt furious in his heart.

The truth had finally been revealed.

Evidently, the person to eliminate the Zhou Heavenly Clan was the Moon Immortal. As for Su Rou and Su Mei, they were still in her grasp.

Even though Chu Feng knew that the Moon Immortal was forced into occupying Su Rou and Su Mei’s bodies, and that the clues that she had spent great effort to leave behind also served to prove that she did not plan to cause harm to Su Rou and Su Mei, and that she was also extremely apologetic toward him, Chu Feng remained very angry.

After all, those were his beloved women. The Moon Immortal had seized Su Rou and Su Mei’s bodies without their consent at all.

She had forcibly seized their bodies.

Chu Feng had also experienced the feeling of having his body seized by the Evil God Sword. Thus, he knew very well the feeling of helplessness, when he no longer held control over his body.

As for Su Rou and Su Mei, the two of them had had to endure that sort of feeling for so long. As such, how could Chu Feng not feel distressed? How could he not be angry?

“Chu Feng, your anger will not be able to do anything. She should’ve been in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm the entire time. However, she was able to avoid you for so long. This means that she most definitely possesses some sort of concealment ability.”

“Fortunately, she does not plan to cause any harm to Su Rou and Su Mei. I believe that they should be safe.”

“You shouldn’t worry too much about it either,” Her Lady Queen advised.

Chu Feng understood all of that. However, he was still unable to contain his anger. That said... he did not wish to worry Her Lady Queen. Thus, he could only forcibly suppress the anger deep down into his heart and not directly reveal it. He planned to endure the anger alone.

Afterwards, Chu Feng returned to Hero City. After bidding farewell to everyone, he proceeded toward an ancient teleportation formation. That teleportation formation was called the Stairway to Heaven.

Merely, this Stairway to Heaven did not lead to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Rather, it led to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

“Chu Feng, don’t forget about us.”

“Chu Feng, you must definitely come back and visit us in the future.”

A large group of people were gathered underneath the Stairway to Heaven. Many people from Hero City had showed up to see Chu Feng off.

It was not only those who had friendships with Chu Feng. Even those who did not possess any friendship with Chu Feng also gathered to see him off. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

If Zhan Haichuan and Grandmaster Kai Hong were two legendary individuals of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm from two different periods, then Chu Feng would be, in their eyes, the legend of the present era.

They all felt that even after entering the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Chu Feng would be able to attain standing there. They were all filled with anticipation toward Chu Feng’s future.

Although they were unable to personally witness what Chu Feng would experience and how he would overcome his obstacles upon reaching the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they were able to witness with their very eyes how Chu Feng would leave the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, how he would end his story in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

With that... Chu Feng would have a new beginning.

To them, being able to personally see Chu Feng off was a sort of honor.

It was something that they could brag about for the rest of their lives.

“Everyone, please rest assured. I will definitely return.”

“These are my kind regards. Everyone, please accept them.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out stones from his Cosmos Sack,

Then, he personally handed those stones to Daoist Three Swords, Grandmaster Pocket, Tang Ying, Xu Yiyi, Song Biyu... and many others.

Originally, the crowd thought that Chu Feng was planning to gift them some sort of precious gift. Thus, they had originally thought about refusing him.

However, upon discovering that they were merely ordinary stones, they all gladly accepted them.

Chu Feng handed the last stone to the guardian clan’s clan chief.

Merely, the guardian clan’s clan chief was still wearing that long gown that concealed his appearance. No one knew who he was.

“Senior, I will entrust that matter to you,” Chu Feng said through a voice transmission.

“Young Master Chu Feng, please rest assured. I will definitely carry out your request,” the guardian clan’s clan chief guaranteed.
