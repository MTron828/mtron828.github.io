MGA: Chapter 804 - A Sincere Invitation

After announcing the results of the battle, letting the world know of the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s brutal defeat, and letting them experience Chu Feng’s powerful aptitude, the Earth King drove out the observers from the Depraved Ravine.

They also reactivated the Sealing Spirit Formation over the Depraved Ravine. Since they already knew the method of activation, doing it again proved no difficulty to them.

As for the Demon Sealing Sword, putting aside that there was simply no one who could approach it due to the Spirit Formation, even if one could, pretty much no one could take it away. So, the Earth King and the others were not worried because they knew very well the immense power of the sword.

“Wuqing, the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s been horrifically defeated this time, so they will most definitely retaliate. I’m sure they will send an army soon, so let us quickly leave this place first,” the Earth King said to Chu Feng after examining the formation, confirming there were no holes and that it was fully activated.

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded, then left with the Earth King, the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers, and Xuan Xiaochao and the others. As for the others from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, they hid their identities and blended in with the several tens of thousands of people who came to watch the spectacle, leaving together with them.

When everyone left, the Depraved Ravine was so silent it was a bit odd. One could only hear bursts of wind; it was completely quiet otherwise, to the point it was even a bit frightening.

However, just at that moment, outside the Spirit Formation, there was a squirming in the air. Quickly after, two people appeared.

They were both female. One was middle-aged with suitable clothes for her appearance, while the other was a sweet and beautiful young woman.

Both of them came from the Misty Peak. The young one was Chun Wu, and the middle-aged one was the guardian of the Misty Peak, one of the most influential characters of the Eastern Sea Region, Lady Piaomiao.

At that moment, Lady Piaomiao was standing in the air. She held a broken mud jar, and she was staring in the direction Chu Feng and the others left at with her fierce eyes. After a long while, she said, “Chu Feng’s talent has surpassed my expectation. No wonder, no wonder...”

“Master, do we let Chu Feng and the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect go just like that? We don’t need to follow him?” asked Chun Wu a bit worriedly. She didn’t understand the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect well, so she wasn’t too reassured.

“There’s no need. Although sometimes the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect don’t choose what methods they use to achieve their goals, they do emphasize righteousness. They won’t take away Chu Feng’s Royal Armament, nor will they harm Chu Feng.

“After all, Chu Feng had helped them out greatly this time. One could almost say it was he who saved all of their lives. They barely have enough time to thank him, so why would they harbour malicious intents?” Lady Piaomiao said.

“But Master, when they were in the underground palace before, didn’t you say the Earth King would definitely kill him if Chu Feng pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword?” Chun Wu said.

“Hoh...” Lady Piaomiao calmly smiled, then said, “The Demon Sealing Sword is very significant to the Crippling Night Demon Sect. I had once heard that before the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect passed away, he had once said the Crippling Night Demon Sect would be led by whoever was able to pull out the Demon Sealing Sword.

“However, not to mention being able to pull out the Demon Sealing Sword, there is not even anyone in the Crippling Night Demon Sect who can approach it. If Chu Feng had truly pulled it out, wouldn’t that mean the Crippling Night Demon Sect would be led by a brat none of them were familiar with?

“Putting aside the fact that the Four Protectors wouldn’t be willing to, even the scattered disciples of the Crippling Night Demon Sect wouldn’t be willing to. As a higher-up of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, the Earth King most definitely knew that.

“So, if Chu Feng had truly pulled it out, for the sake of the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s stability, he would have killed Chu Feng because he would not allow the Crippling Night Demon Sect to be controlled by an outsider. After all, to the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, only the Four Protectors are qualified to lead the Crippling Night Demon Sect,” Lady Piaomiao explained.

“But Chu Feng still received the protection of the Demon Sealing Sword—he already did something they were all unable to do. Would they not kill Chu Feng right now for the peace of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, and to avoid future problems?” Chun Wu was still worried.

“Like I said, the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect emphasize righteousness. As long as their forbidden issues are not violated, there will definitely be nothing that will happen to Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng is also very smart and he didn’t pass that line. So, the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect will not kill him. Not only that, they should also want to pull him into their sect. After all, they aren’t fools. No matter who, they would want to get closer to a genius like Chu Feng,” Lady Piaomiao explained.

“I understand.” Only after hearing all that was Chun Wu more at ease. However, when she looked at the broken mud jar hand, she lightly frowned and asked with great confusion, “Actually, I still have one thing I don’t understand. Master, why did you hiddenly save her?”

“Perhaps keeping her will be useful.” Lady Piaomiao made an unfathomable smile, and as she spoke, she also looked at the broken mud jar in her hands.

On the surface, the mud jar appeared very ordinary. It was even horribly broken. However, inside, countless blinding runes flickered. Their light reflected off one another, forming several powerful formations.

In the very center of those formations, there was actually a perfect, undamaged Consciousness lying peacefully.

Not to mention Chu Feng, even the Earth King didn’t detect Lady Piaomiao nor Chun Wu in the slightest. So, after sealing the Depraved Ravine, they left without a worry.

After passing through the Stone Forest of Death, they travelled for several tens of thousands of miles before setting up camp on a mountain range. Actually, they didn’t really need to rest due to their cultivation levels, but it was just that the Earth King had something he wanted to discuss with Chu Feng.

After setting up camp, Old Liu ordered the eighth and ninth brother to find some food. When they did though, it was already deep into the night.

However, the eighth and ninth brother were very competent in their searching. Not only were there meat and vegetables, there was even wine.

At that moment, despite being already late in the night, as they sat on the apex of a mountain peak, within the scenery of the night, there was a special type of ambience as they drank wine and ate meat, especially after such a perilous battle. Such a life did become an extravagant sort of enjoyment.

“Wuqing, I have a request. I just wonder if you can agree to it or not?” Suddenly, the Earth King smiled and looked at Chu Feng. Moreover, everyone all put down the wine bowls in their hands and orderly cast their gazes at Chu Feng.

“Senior, just speak your mind. As long as I, Wuqing, can do it, I will not refuse,” replied Chu Feng with a smile.

“Wuqing, your talent is outstanding. You are a genius extremely rarely seen in the Eastern Sea Region. Representing the Crippling Night Demon Sect, I would like to invite you to join us. I wonder... do you agree or not?” said the Earth King sincerely.

Moreover, as he spoke those words, his eyes were full of hope, yet also contained a bit of worry. He was afraid—afraid Chu Feng would refuse. After all, he was such a rare genius. Everyone knew Chu Feng’s future was inestimable. Even if he refused, it was within reason.

It was actually not only the Earth King who worried. Old Liu, Xuan Xiaochao, Fu Fengming, You Tonghan, and almost everyone from the Crippling Night Demon Sect who were there worried.

Because they really hoped Chu Feng could enter the Crippling Night Demon Sect.
