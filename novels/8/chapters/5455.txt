Chapter 5455: Sensing Chu Feng’s Means As an Outsider

“You said that you were the one who let it out?”

The crowd stared at Chu Feng in shock. In particular, Jia Lingyi and the World Spiritist Painter had complicated looks on their faces.

“Nonsense! How can you possibly control something like that?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jia Lingyi chose not to believe Chu Feng’s words. She frenziedly flung the token in her hand, attempting to command the monster to kill Chu Feng, but the monster continued to kneel before Chu Feng without budging in the least.

By this point, even those who initially doubted Chu Feng’s words began to waver. It was clear that Jia Lingyi didn’t have the power to control the monster.

In contrast, Chu Feng slowly raised his hand and pointed toward Jia Lingyi’s warship.

“Obliterate it.”

The monster swung its claws, and screams of agony ensued. Smithereens rained down from the sky, together with the blood and flesh of the experts riding on the warship.

While the monster was still exerting its oppressive might, it wasn’t suppressing anyone else other than Jia Lingyi and those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. That was more than enough to prove that the monster heeded Chu Feng’s orders.

“Young friend Chu Feng, how did you do it?”

The World Spiritist Painter looked at Chu Feng in astonishment. He couldn’t understand how Chu Feng controlled that monster, for the latter shouldn’t have known the method to do so.

“Elder, I’ll explain it to you later. I need to deal with Jia Lingyi first.”

Chu Feng slowly made his way toward Jia Lingyi a step at a time. In response, Jia Lingyi glared at him angrily. She had no choice but to believe that he was the one controlling the monster.

“You did it on purpose. You were toying with me!” Jia Lingyi roared.

“Yes, I was toying with you, but you were a fool to fall for that. You were so gleeful at having turned the tables that you didn’t stop to consider why the person who helped you unseal the monster had fled from here,” Chu Feng replied.

“You beast!!!” Jia Lingyi roared. Even though she had been suppressed, the crowd could still clearly sense her killing intent.

Pu!

Blood spurted all around.

A sword had rushed forth to penetrate Jia Lingyi’s throat. It was Chu Feng’s doing. However, he didn’t kill her with this single strike as he thought that it would be letting her off too easily.

“There’s no point wasting time here. Let me first deal with the others from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect,” Chu Feng said as he glanced at the survivors from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect turned pale.

“Young hero Chu Feng, spare our lives! We have nothing to do with the grudge between you and Jia Lingyi!” they pleaded for their lives.

“This matter has everything to do with you from the moment you wore those clothes and began Jia Lingyi’s lackeys,” Chu Feng sneered.

The monster swung its claws, and blood splurted everywhere.

In an instant, everyone from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, with the exception of Jia Lingyi, was dead. The crowd looked at Chu Feng with fearful eyes, even Long Suqing and Long Kuitian.

It was not uncommon for cultivators to massacre others, but it was rare for someone to be able to carry out such slaughter without the slightest change in expression, even if for vengeance. This could only mean that viciousness was part of Chu Feng’s intrinsic nature too.

“Chu Feng, Chu Feng, Chu Feng… How did you do that? How did you get that monster to listen to your orders? Hurry up and fill me in on the details!” Eggy couldn’t help but ask. She was also confused by the situation too.

“Do you still remember what I did when the black aura tried to breach the seal while we were inside the All Lives Are Equal Palace?” Chu Feng asked.

“You first used your own hand to seal off the gate before channeling the formation. So, that was when you pulled it off?” Eggy widened her eyes in realization.

Now that she thought about it, the monster had suddenly calmed down after Chu Feng placed his hand on the gate. It was only after the monster calmed down that he finally channeled the formation to deal with the black aura.

However, there were still questions in her mind, so she asked, “But when did you grasp the way to control the monster?”

“I didn’t grasp the way. I used my own method,” Chu Feng replied.

“Your own method?” Eggy asked.

“The Dao of Absolute Darkness,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ah!” Eggy widened her eyes in realization.

She knew about the Dao of Absolute Darkness. That was the power Chu Feng had grasped from the remnant located in the forest where Li Wu, the Black-feathered Specter, resided in.

There were three Dao of Absolute Darkness hidden inside the black crystal, of which, two had been grasped by others. The remaining one inside the crystal was the hardest one to grasp. Even the owner of the crystal, who proclaimed herself an emperor, was unable to grasp it.

Chu Feng had mentioned that the Dao of Absolute Darkness could be forged into a secret skill, but it needed a powerful medium for that. The monster was the medium he had chosen. Looking back, Chu Feng must have calmed the monster down by fusing the Dao of Absolute Darkness into its body.

“You used the formation to block the black aura not because you were afraid that it would unseal the monster but to prevent it from hindering you from controlling that monster?” Eggy asked.

“That’s right. It takes some time for the Dao of Absolute Darkness to fuse into the monster, so I had to stop the black aura,” Chu Feng replied.

“It’s no wonder you said that it’s an opportunity. To think that you’d hide this even from me. Tsk!” There was a smile on Eggy’s face despite her grumbling, which showed that she was happy for him.

“I wanted to give you a surprise,” Chu Feng replied.

“That sure is a huge surprise,” Eggy grumbled.

She usually knew what Chu Feng was up to as she shared senses with him, so it was rare for him to be able to surprise her. However, she was truly caught by surprise this time around, and it impressed her. She could feel just how formidable Chu Feng was.

“So, is it a success?” Eggy asked.

“Neither of those two fellows is easy to deal with, but I was able to easier control them by first pitting them against each other. All I need to do now is to tie up some loose ends to finish up the secret skill… though I’ll have to use the monster’s power to deal with Jia Lingyi first.”

Chu Feng continued making his way toward Jia Lingyi while communicating with Eggy. When he finally arrived before Jia Lingyi, he asked, “Who’s the woman you joined hands with?”
