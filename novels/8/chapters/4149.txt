Chapter 4149 - Failure?

“What’s this? Scared?”

Seeing their hesitation, Chu Feng pressed on.

“What a joke. What wouldn’t we dare? We’re only afraid that you can’t afford the loss,” said the four world spiritists.

Even though kowtowing to apologize and cutting out one’s tongue was a very humiliating thing, it was nothing when compared to death.

Besides, they firmly believed that Chu Feng would not be able to breach the spirit formation. As such, it was only natural that they’d accept the bet without any hesitation.

“Very well,” Seeing that they’d accepted, Chu Feng nodded.

Then, he turned to Grandmaster Liangqiu. “Grandmaster, let’s begin.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he directly released his spirit power and sent it to attack the spirit formation entrance.

Seeing this, Grandmaster Liangqiu was stunned.

He had intended to tell Chu Feng how to breach the spirit formation. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After all, he had made four attempts, and gained some knowledge and experience through them.

He did not expect Chu Feng to directly begin breaching the spirit formation without waiting for his pointers.

Standing before the entrance and witnessing Chu Feng’s world spirit power contending against the protective formation at close range, he was able to sense the change to the spirit formation.

The method that Chu Feng was using to breach the spirit formation was completely different from theirs.

If one were to examine Chu Feng’s method normally, one would find it to be incorrect. If he continued to breach the spirit formation in such a manner, he would undoubtedly end in a failure.

Because of that, Grandmaster Liangqiu started to panic.

It was fine if they failed to breach the spirit formation. After all, him and the other four world spiritists had all been unable to do anything to it before.

Even if Chu Feng were to fail it would not be humiliating.

However, Chu Feng had made a bet against those four world spiritists.

Furthermore, he had used his own life as the gambling stake. With that he could not afford to lose.

They must successfully breach the spirit formation. Failure was not an option.

Whilst Grandmaster Liangqiu was feeling worried Chu Feng suddenly spoke, “Grandmaster Liangqiu, please assist me.”

“Young friend Chu Feng, how shall I help you?” Grandmaster Liangqiu had a frown on his face as he asked.

He believed that the method Chu Feng was using was completely wrong.

Thus, he had no idea how to assist him.

Right when Grandmaster Liangqiu was feeling confused, a voice transmission entered his ears.

That voice belonged to none other than Chu Feng.

“Grandmaster Liangqiu, you only need to assimilate your world spirit power with mine. You can leave everything else to me.”

Hearing those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu became baffled.

Didn’t Chu Feng ask him to help him? If all he had to do would be fusing his spirit power with Chu Feng’s, it would not be a helping hand at all.

Exactly what was Chu Feng thinking?

Although Grandmaster Liangqiu was confused, he had no choice but to do as Chu Feng said with the way things were going.

When he released his spirit power and assimilated it with Chu Feng’s as per his instructions, his expression suddenly changed. He was stunned.

An enormous commotion arose in his heart.

At that moment he was so emotional that he started shivering, and goosebumps broke out all over his body.

After his spirit power mixed with Chu Feng’s, he was able to sense the transformation that was occuring to the protective formation.

Even though Chu Feng’s method appeared very dangerous and appeared to be incorrect, he could sense Chu Feng’s spirit power sweeping across everything in its path as it entered the protective formation. His spirit power was on a conquest.

That incomparably powerful protective formation that had baffled them four times in a row was unable to retaliate against Chu Feng’s offensive in the slightest. It would not be wrong to say that the protective formation had been stripped of its armor.

With this sort of formation breaching method, the spirit formation would soon be breached by Chu Feng.

“So that’s the case. So the method to breach this spirit formation is actually this simple. Why didn’t I think of this?”

“Is this the line of thought of a genius?”

Grandmaster Liangqiu looked at Chu Feng again. Complicated emotions filled his eyes.

He had learned Chu Feng’s method of breaching the spirit formation. It turned out that the method they had believed to be the most incorrect was actually the most correct one.

If he had realized this earlier then there would simply have been no need for Chu Feng to do anything. He and the other world spiritists would also have been able to breach the protective formation together.

However, if it wasn’t for Chu Feng’s demonstration, if his spirit power hadn’t fused with Chu Feng’s and followed Chu Feng’s spirit power, then he might never have imagined that this would be the correct method to breach the spirit formation.

Of course, even though he knew the correct method now, he still would not be able to breach it himself. He needed to join hands with others in order to do so.

However, it was different for Chu Feng. Chu Feng actually didn’t need his help. Chu Feng’s spirit power was extremely powerful. He would be able to breach the spirit formation all on his own.

Grandmaster Liangqiu was momentarily so shocked that he was unable to accept it.

Even though he already knew that there was a disparity between his and Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques after Chu Feng became a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he did not anticipate the disparity to be so huge.

Even though he had joined hands with the other four world spiritists, they had been unable to breach the spirit formation. Yet, Chu Feng had able to breach it all on his own.

That’s right. He did it all on his own.

Chu Feng had no need for Grandmaster Liangqiu’s assistance at all. He was able to breach the spirit formation all on his own.

Truth was, Chu Feng had Grandmaster Liangqiu assimilate his spirit power with his own merely so that Grandmaster Liangqiu could sense his method of breaching the spirit formation.

The reason why Chu Feng had Grandmaster Liangqiu assist him was all so that he could help Grandmaster Liangqiu get revenge.

That was also the reason why he dared to gamble with his life as the stake.

As such, in addition to being stunned, Grandmaster Liangqiu was also deeply moved. Surging emotions filled his heart, so much so that his eyes started to moisten.

Before Chu Feng had arrived, he had been feeling truly sullen.

Even though his world spirit techniques surpassed those of the other four world spiritists, he had still been looked down on by them.

Even though Long Daozhi was the fully deserving strongest person in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he was also looked down on by the others out there.

The reason for this was not purely because of their strength. It was also because of their birthplace.

It was all because they were from the Ancestral Martial Starfield that they ended up being looked down on so much by others.

However, after Grandmaster Liangqiu sensed Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques, he felt that a chance to change fate had arrived.

Whilst it might be impossible for them to change everything, Chu Feng was capable of changing everything.

He possessed the ability to change the way people viewed them.

“Hahaha...”

At the moment when Chu Feng was focused on breaching the spirit formation and Grandmaster Liangqiu was brimming with tears of excitement from sensing how powerful Chu Feng was, mocking laughter sounded.

It came from those four world spiritists.

They were all laughing arrogantly with glee. It was like they were taking delight at another’s misfortune.

As world spiritists, they saw Chu Feng’s formation breaching method was a complete mistake.

“Long Daozhi, oh Long Daozhi, look at the two expert world spiritists that you’ve invited.”

“You could’ve gone and sought out a powerful world spiritist to aid us. With that, we would’ve been able to guarantee success with this final opportunity, breach the spirit formation, and open up the entrance to the Endless Abyss.”

“Unfortunately, it’s too late now. The two of them are using a completely incorrect method to breach the spirit formation.”

“Just like that, they’ve wasted the final opportunity.”

“We are also powerless to do anything now,” the four world spiritists mocked.

They had not assimilated their spirit power with Chu Feng’s. Thus, they were unable to sense the results of Chu Feng’s method.

Looking from the outside, they reacted in the same manner that Grandmaster Liangqiu had earlier. They were practically certain that things would end in a failure.

“Four grandmasters, could it be that the formation breaching method has ended in failure?” asked the four leaders at once.

They were not Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists. Thus, they were unable to see through Chu Feng’s formation breaching method.

To them, Chu Feng’s spirit formation had yet to conclude. As such, they could not be certain if his method was the correct one or not.

But, after hearing the comments from those four world spiritists, they assumed that their final attempt had ended in failure; that their formation breaching process had come to an end.

Actually, even Long Daozhi had started panicking slightly after hearing the claims made by those four world spiritists.

“His breaching method is simply an act of messing around. He’s simply wasting his chance. Any world spiritist could tell that his method is completely incorrect.”

“Without a doubt, they’ve already wasted the final opportunity.”

“He did that on purpose,” said the four world spiritists with determined expressions.

“This bastard! I’ll kill him!”

The four leaders grew furious upon hearing those claims.

They all released their oppressive might towards Chu Feng.

If Chu Feng had taken the formation breaching process seriously, they would have been able to reluctantly accept things even if he were to fail. At the very most, they’d punish Chu Feng and Long Daozhi, and have them provide a statement for their mistake.

However, upon learning that Chu Feng was messing around and deliberately failing their final opportunity, they were incapable of tolerating him.

The desire to kill Chu Feng was firmly established in their hearts.

“Clamor~~~”

Right at that moment, a shattering sound was heard.

Looking over, the expressions of Long Daozhi, the four leaders and all the others present changed enormously.

This was especially true for the four world spiritists. They were completely dumbfounded and stunned.

The reason for that was because the spirit formation guarding the entrance had shattered.

Chu Feng had actually managed to breach the protective formation!

Furthermore, his speed had been extremely fast!

“You four, what did you say earlier?”

Chu Feng turned around and looked at the four world spiritists with a beaming smile.

At that moment, the four world spiritists that had been immensely proud of themselves and who had been insulting Chu Feng had become speechless...

Not only that, but they also looked like they had been fed feces. their expressions were extremely ugly.
