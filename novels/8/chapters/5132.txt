Chapter 5132: That Is a Clan-protection Secret Skill

The ancient talisman was none other than the one that Lord Yuwei said could enhance one’s secret skill. It was the item Chu Feng received in compensation for deciphering the formation that had trapped everyone earlier in the Darknight Sacred River.

“Thank you, Elder Bai.”

Chu Feng initially thought that Lord Bai’s disappearance was peculiar. He didn’t associate the latter with the terrifying formation. However, after hearing Lord Yuwei’s side of the story, it was almost certain that Lord Bai was the one behind that terrifying formation.

In fact, the formation might have been intended to be a trial for Chu Feng, or else he wouldn’t have given out this talisman after Chu Feng deciphered it.

“Little young master?”

Lord Yuwei was surprised by Chu Feng’s sudden words of gratitude toward Lord Bai.

Chu Feng told Lord Yuwei about his acquisition of the talisman after he deciphered the formation and shared his analysis.

“Old Bai has been hiding his true strength all this while? What does he have to gain out of this?”

Lord Yuwei found the situation hard to accept. How could she easily come to terms with the fact that someone whom she had known for nearly a thousand years now wasn’t actually the person she knew him to be?

She couldn’t understand Lord Bai’s motives either.

The Lord Bai she knew of was an extremely kind person, but why didn’t he stop the guards from oppressing them if he had the ability to do so? It would mean that he had turned a blind eye to the guards’ atrocities over the years.

That was hard for her to accept.

“My guess is that Elder Bai was plotting something related to the Night Monarch, and his aim probably can be found inside this medicine.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a jade bottle that functioned like a Cosmos Sack, allowing one to store a huge amount of medicine within it. The jade bottle looked ordinary on the surface, but the medicine inside was definitely not to be made light of.

It was the medicine that Lord Bai had been brewing thus far to help with the Demonsoul Grass’ cultivation.

The cultivators trapped in the Darknight Sacred River had been using this medicine to enhance the growth of the Demonsoul Grass, but Chu Feng had a feeling that there was more to it than just that. It likely contained the secret behind what Lord Bai was up to.

“Little young master, are you able to tell what secrets are hidden inside the medicine?” Lord Yuwei asked.

“I’m afraid that I can’t see through the secrets behind Elder Bai’s medicine due to the limitations of my cultivation.”

Chu Feng awkwardly shook his head in response.

However, he was certain that there must be something deeper to the medicine. The fact that he was unable to see through it showed just how formidable Lord Bai’s means were.

“I just hope that Old Bai isn’t a bad person,” Lord Yuwei said with a sigh.

“I don’t think that Elder Bai is a bad person. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have handed over such a formidable talisman to me,” Chu Feng said as he took out the talisman that was in his dantian.

He had accumulated quite a lot of good stuff in his dantian thus far, but he could only use very few of them. It was fortunate that this talisman had no limitations, allowing him to use it right away.

“Yes, this is the talisman that Old Bai gave me. He sure has hidden his true identity well. I really thought that he had really found this talisman from the ground, but who could have thought…”

Lord Yuwei was able to recognize the talisman right away.

“Lord Yuwei, is there anything I have to take note of when fusing the talisman together with my secret skill?” Chu Feng asked.

“There’s nothing you need to take note of. You can fuse it right away,” Lord Yuwei said.

“Alright. I’ll be using the talisman then.”

Chu Feng proceeded to place the talisman into his body. He had already chosen what secret skill he wanted to fuse it with—the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

That was the secret skill he had obtained from the Ancient Era’s War Clan in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. The Ancient Era’s War Clan had a lofty history behind it despite having grown weak, and the Ancient Era’s War Sword was ranked third of their Nine Great Secret Skills.

For a period of time, it was Chu Feng’s strongest means. He was able to fend off many powerful enemies thanks to it. However, as he continued to grow stronger, the Ancient Era’s War Sword became relatively weaker compared to his newer skills.

By now, it had become so weak that he didn’t use it anymore.

Nevertheless, the Ancient Era’s War Sword was still the secret skill that harnessed the most potential in Chu Feng’s arsenal other than the one he received from the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

Unfortunately, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s secret skill refused to submit to him, so he was unable to use it. This made the Ancient Era’s War Sword the next best option.

However, after trying a few times to fuse the talisman into the Ancient Era’s War Sword, Chu Feng turned to Lord Yuwei with a baffled look.

“Elder Yuwei, is there really nothing to take note of for the fusion process?”

He was unable to fuse the talisman together with the Ancient Era’s War Sword at all.

“Indeed,” Lord Yuwei replied.

“That’s weird. Why am I unable to fuse the talisman with my secret skill?” Chu Feng murmured with a frown.

“You’re unable to fuse it? Little young master, may I have a look at the talisman?” Lord Yuwei asked.

“Of course.”

Chu Feng took out the talisman and passed it over to Lord Yuwei. Lord Yuwei took a moment to inspect it before passing it back. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“This talisman is identical to the one I have received from Old Bai. It doesn’t make sense that you’re unable to fuse it. Little young master, is it possible that… your secret skill is too weak?” Lord Yuwei asked.

“Too weak? That doesn’t seem plausible. This secret skill of mine originates from the Ancient Era’s War Clan, and it’s one of their strongest secret skills,” Chu Feng replied.

“What? A secret skill from the Ancient Era’s War Clan? Little young master, you are acquainted with people from the Ancient Era’s War Clan?”

Lord Yuwei was surprised to hear Chu Feng’s words.

“Elder Yuwei, you know of the Ancient Era’s War Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng knew that the real Ancient Era’s War Clan were extremely powerful, and the one he had met in the Hundred Refineries Ordinary Realm was only its offshoot. He was extremely curious about the Ancient Era’s War Clan, just that he had never been able to gather any information about them.

Lord Yuwei’s reaction showed that she knew something about the Ancient Era’s War Clan, or at the very least, she had heard of them.
