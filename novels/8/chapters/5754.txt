Chapter 5754: The Powerful Huangfu Heavenly Clan

“It’ll be yours if you win,” the brawny Huangfu said.

Qin Xuan leaped into the dueling ring, accepting the challenge.

“The Huangfu Clan seems to have quite a few treasures,” Long Chengyu remarked.

The treasures the Huangfu Heavenly Clan had brought out thus far revealed they were rich with resources.

“They’re probably one of the powerful clans who chose to keep a low profile. I’ve never heard of them before,” Long Muxi said.

On the dueling ring, Qin Xian looked at the brawny Huangfu and asked, “Aren’t you going to introduce yourself?”

“Huangfu Shangwu,” the brawny man said.

Without any warning, he flirted behind Qin Xuan and smashed his gigantic fist down on him.

Qin Xuan instantaneously released three different layers of auras, raising his cultivation from rank six Half-God level to rank nine Half-God level. At the same time, he exerted tremendous oppressive might on Huangfu Shangwu.

It was as if he had known that Huangfu Shangwu would launch a sneak attack. Not only was he prepared for it, but he even launched a counterattack against it.

The two of them were so close that Huangfu Shangwu should have had no time to react to his counterattack, thus sealing his defeat, but unexpectedly, he wasn’t pushed back by Qin Xuan’s oppressive might at all.

Qin Xuan keenly noticed that and quickly dodged.

Huangfu Shangwu’s fist landed squarely at where Qin Xuan was previously standing.

He was unfazed by Qin Xuan’s counterattack because he had unleashed his Heavenly Bloodline. On top of the Lightning Mark and the Lightning Armor, there were two Lightning Wings sprouting from his back too.

“Those are the Lightning Wings! Is he able to raise his cultivation by three ranks? I didn’t think someone could grasp the Heavenly Bloodline to such an extent at Half-God level.”

The crowd was astonished.

Chu Feng was taken aback as well, as he could tell that Huangfu Shangwu’s Lightning Wings were the real deal. The latter had full control over his Lightning Wings.

Without a doubt, Huangfu Shangwu was a powerful individual!

“I’ll have to take this seriously,” Qin Xuan remarked as he whipped out a golden sword.

The energies in the dueling ring shook upon the emergence of the sword, and Qin Xuan’s fighting prowess surged by leaps and bounds. It was a God Armament!

“Come, I’ll let you make your move first this time around,” Huangfu Shangwu said as he beckoned Qin Xuan over with his finger.

“You aren’t going to draw your God Armament?” Qin Xuan asked.

“I don’t need that to deal with someone who relies on mysterious skills,” Huangfu Shangwu replied.

“That fellow is arrogant!” the crowd exclaimed.

Qin Xuan was the most talented prodigy from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. As formidable as Huangfu Shandwu was, he would pay a heavy price for looking down so much on Qin Xuan.

Qin Xuan didn’t let his guard down despite Huangfu Shangwu’s arrogance. Instead of engaging in close-quarter combat, he swung his God Armament and released a barrage of sword qi.

“Hmph!” Huangfu Shangwu harrumphed.

He hurled his fist forth, unleashing a surge of lightning that crushed the barrage of sword qi and rushed at Qin Xuan.

Qin Xuan tried to retaliate, but Huangfu Shangwu suddenly flitted behind him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Xuan sensed that something was amiss and quickly executed a movement skill to put some distance between them before launching another wave of attack, but Huangfu Shangwu easily dealt with it.

“Qin Xuan is going to fall in defeat,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Chu Feng agreed as well. Even though Qin Xuan had drawn a God Armament to augment his fighting prowess, it wasn’t enough to grant him an advantage against Huangfu Shangwu. Instead, it was slowly becoming clear that Huangfu Shangwu was intentionally pulling back his punches to toy with Qin Xuan.

Unless Qin Xuan had an ace up his sleeves, the outcome of the battle was clear.

“It’s about time,” Huangfu Shangwu said as he flitted behind Qin Xuan once more.

Qin Xuan tried to execute his movement skill once more to put some distance between them again, but Huangfu Shangwu didn’t give him a chance to do so this time. Huangfu Shangwu thrust his palm, and lightning surged forth and surrounded Qin Xuan.

It was too late for Qin Xuan to dodge the lightning, so he had no choice but to deal with the attack with his God Armament. To his horror, the lightning pierced right through his defense and electrocuted his body. It took a mere moment for him to collapse to the ground, twitching.

“This…”

Of the crowd, those from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect struggled to accept the outcome. They could tell that Qin Xuan had been defeated in a humiliating way. Huangfu Shangwu hadn’t even brought out his God Armament!

To make things worse, Huangfu Shangwu raised the immobilized Qin Xuan and tossed him off the dueling ring as if he was trash. He cast a disdainful glance at the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s sect members before stepping off the dueling ring.

The dashing Huangfu took his place and leaped onto the dueling ring. Having decided on his opponent, he turned to Long Chengyu and said, “Long Chengyu, I am Huangfu Shangyang. I’ll give you a chance to prove yourself today. If you defeat me, you can have this.”

Huangfu Shangyang took out a pearl harnessing energy that could enhance one’s bloodline power.

Seeing that, Long Chengyu leaped onto the dueling ring.

“Be careful, Brother Chengyu. That person is strong,” Chu Feng reminded him via voice transmission.

“Don’t worry. I might not be a match for Xianhai Shaoyu, but the least I can do is to defeat the likes of them,” Long Chengyu replied via voice transmission.

“Bring out your God Armament,” Huangfu Shangyang said.

“I won’t show mine unless you show yours,” Long Chengyu replied.

“There’s no need for me to do that to deal with your pathetic bloodline,” Huangfu Shangyang replied.

Long Chengyu’s eyes turned cold. Without attempting to probe his opponent or raise his cultivation, he charged at Huangfu Shangyang.

The latter stood still on the spot, awaiting Long Chengyu’s arrival.

Long Chengyu smashed a fist packed with power and speed into Huangfu Shangyang’s face, but the latter easily dodged the punch by inclining his body backward.

“Don’t let your guard down, Brother Chengyu. Raise your cultivation and exert your strongest means,” Chu Feng advised Long Chengyu via voice transmission.

He could tell from this brief exchange of blows that Huangfu Shangyang was stronger than Huangfu Shangwu. Unless Long Chengyu managed to catch the latter off guard, he was likely going to lose this battle.

However, Long Chengyu ignored Chu Feng’s voice transmission, continuing his frenzied attacks without making any changes whatsoever.

In response, Huangfu Shangyang just kept dodging. He didn't bother raising his cultivation since Long Chengyu didn’t do so. The contempt he displayed was more than how Huangfu Shangwu treated Qin Xuan.

“You bastard! Why do you keep dodging? Fight back!”

Long Chengyu’s attacks became more ferocious the angrier he became, but he was still unable to touch Huangfu Shangyang. The latter easily dodged all of his attacks.

Huangfu Shangyang didn’t respond to Long Chengyu’s words. He merely continued looking at the latter with a detestful smile.

Boom!

Suddenly, a golden aura surfaced around Long Chengyu. Dragon horns emerged from his forehead, and dragon scales covered his face. In an instant, his cultivation rose three ranks to rank nine Half-God level.

The martial skills he executed immediately became much stronger.

It turned out he had feigned anger so as to make Huangfu Shangyang think that he had lost his rationality so that he could catch the other party off guard and launch a surprise attack.

Tzlala!

With a flicker of lightning, Huangfu Shangyang dodged Long Chengyu’s attack.

Without any warning, a palm infused with lightning suddenly appeared behind Long Chengyu and viciously struck his neck area, causing the latter to become incapacitated and collapse to the ground.
