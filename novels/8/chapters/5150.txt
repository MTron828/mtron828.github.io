Chapter 5150: A Monster

The white smoke began to infiltrate Bai Yunqing’s body. The latter’s forehead furrows for a brief moment, but it quickly loosened up. With an arrogant smile, he provocatively glanced at Chu Feng’s formation, as if showing off his strength.

The formation likely sensed that the white smoke was unable to deal any damage to Bai Yunqing, so it was quickly replaced with gray smoke.

Grar!

The dragon’s roar was much louder with the gray smoke, such that even ordinary humans would be able to hear it. The gray smoke was much more domineering in terms of strength and aura. This time around, Bai Yunqing’s frown lasted for a little longer.

However, his willpower was indeed nothing to be made light of. His frown soon loosened up once again, though his smile looked a little stiff.

The gray smoke in Bai Yunqing’s formation was soon replaced with blue smoke.

This time around, Bai Yunqing clenched his teeth tightly, and his smile disappeared without a trace too. Despite his strain, he still succeeded in enduring the blue smoke.

Coming after the blue smoke was the purple smoke, followed by the gold smoke.

By the time it reached the golden smoke, the dragon’s roar had become piercingly loud. The silhouette of a golden dragon can be vaguely seen coiling around the formation, and it even launched an attack on Bai Yunqing.

Bai Yunqing’s face warped in pain. He was swiftly approaching his limit. Even so, he still managed to endure it in the end.

The golden smoke soon dissipated. What appeared next wasn’t the smoke of another color but a real dragon emanating the regal air of an imperial emperor. Even through the formation, Chu Feng was able to sense just how powerful the dragon was.

The imperial dragon opened its mouth and released a dragon breath that quickly swallowed Bai Yunqing up.

“Damn it!”

With a curse, Bai Yunqing scrambled out of the formation in a fluster.

From the looks of it, the golden smoke was his limit. He was unable to withstand the onslaught of the imperial dragon.

Bai Yunqing’s face was pale and his robe was completely soaked. Even though he was trying his best to hold it in, he couldn’t stop his body from trembling. In the end, he gave up and crumbled to the floor. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Despite his state, there was a confident smile on his face. He was certain that he could win this trial with his results.

However, when he noticed that the ‘Tiger’ formation was also challenging the golden smoke, a frown formed on his forehead. He stared intently at the formation, only to realize that the golden smoke wasn’t dissipating at all. A relieved smile finally emerged on his lips.

He could tell that the person in the ‘Tiger’ formation had already come out, or else the imperial dragon should have already made an appearance by now. This meant that the ‘Tiger’ person lost in the golden aura trial whereas he had reached the imperial dragon trial.

He had won this battle.

“Tiger trash, why are you still here? If you have any sense of shame, you should back down now!” Bai Yunqing insulted.

“Brat, you aren’t that much better than me. Stop acting so smug!” a voice replied from outside the ‘Tiger’ formation.

“At least the power of the Golden Dragon was unable to pose a problem to me. That shows that I’m better than you,” Bai Yunqing replied.

“What a premature celebration! Can’t you see that there’s one more person who hasn’t undergone the trial yet? I hope that you aren’t that fast on the bed too!” the voice replied.

Even though his voice was coming from the ‘Tiger’ formation, he was actually resting by the corner of the palace. He was intentionally confusing Bai Yunqing so that the latter wouldn’t be able to discern his position.

That showed how cunning he was.

He was wearing a veil, but beneath the veil was a cat head. The third person wasn’t a human but a cat. It was none other than the person who had previously gathered news about the ancient remnant from City Lord Liang, the cat who named itself Lord Tiger.

It was acquainted with Chu Feng, but it would be more apt to call them enemies.

Back when they were in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he had stolen Zhan Haichuan’s legacy, the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip, and even kidnapped Chu Feng’s world spirit Xue Ji.

In any case, this cat had done nothing good in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

If not for the two of them concealing their presence, they would have long recognized each other.

Despite having lost both rounds, the cat leisurely puffed on its smoking pipe by the corner of the palace, not dismayed by its loss at all. It seemed confident that the legacy would fall into its hands. It wasn’t even angry when squabbling with Bai Yunqing; it was just to alleviate its boredom.

Bai Yunqing laughed in response to its words.

“Tiger trash, can’t you tell that this Chu fellow doesn’t even have the courage to step into the formation? Do you really expect him to surpass me? You’re dreaming!”

Bai Yunqing turned his gaze back to Chu Feng’s formation.

“Chu trash, hurry up and leave if you don’t have the guts to challenge the formation. Don’t waste my time here!” Bai Yunqing sneered.

“Laugh while you can, Bai Yunqing,” Chu Feng replied.

“Aiyo, you’re finally willing to speak. I would have thought that you were a mute otherwise. I guess you’re another one of those who are all talk. If you have the guts, I dare you to step into the formation!” Bai Yunqing sneered.

The cat narrowed its eyes upon hearing Chu Feng’s voice.

“Why does that voice sound so familiar?”

It racked its brain, but just like Chu Feng, it was unable to figure out who the identity of that familiar voice was.

Chu Feng couldn’t be bothered to respond to Bai Yunqing’s provocation, so he stepped into the formation right away.

Weng!

White smoke immediately gushed out and surrounded Chu Feng as soon as he stepped in. Despite its harmless appearance, the white smoke did inflict considerable pain that would leave any most cultivators yelping in pain.

However, Chu Feng didn’t even frown in the least.

It was not that he didn’t feel the pain that he had grown accustomed to hardship. Something of this extent was nothing more than a tickle to him.

So, the formation started upping the level of difficulty.

White smoke, gray smoke, blue smoke, purple smoke…

Soon, it came to the golden smoke that the cat was unable to withstand. It brought a tight frown to Chu Feng’s forehead, but he was still able to endure it.

Soon, the golden smoke dissipated, giving way to the imperial dragon.

Bai Yunqing couldn’t help but feel nervous when he saw the imperial dragon. This was where he had failed the trial. It would spell his loss if Chu Feng successfully cleared this trial.

“Shit! How is this possible?” Bai Yunqing cursed.

To his horror, the imperial dragon soon dissipated, and an even larger dragon took its place. This dragon emanated a divine aura reminiscent of an immortal. By now, it had become clear that the difficulty of the trial corresponded to the ranking of God-cloak World Spiritists.

White Dragon Mark, Gray Dragon Mark, Blue Dragon Mark, Purple Dragon Mark, Gold Dragon Mark, Royal Dragon Mark, Immortal Dragon Mark, Exalted Dragon Mark, and Saint Dragon Mark.

Chu Feng was currently on the immortal dragon trial, and if he cleared it, the next one up would be the exalted dragon trial.

However, that was no longer important anymore to Bai Yunqing anymore. He knew that he had already lost.

The smoke in the formation suddenly changed once more. The power of the immortal dragon dissipated, replaced with the power of the exalted dragon.

“This fellow! Is he made of metal? Does he not feel pain at all? How in the world did he tolerate that?”

Bai Yunqing could hardly believe his eyes. He wasn’t bragging when he said that he had been through willpower training from a young age. He was confident in his ability to endure suffering.

He could accept it if someone was able to endure the power of the imperial dragon, but he didn’t think that there would be a junior in the world who could tolerate the power of the immortal dragon as well.

Yet, Chu Feng had already reached the exalted dragon trial!

A resounding dragon roar shook the entire palace as the exalted dragon made its appearance. Just the sight of it was enough to send shivers down Bai Yunqing’s spine. He couldn’t even imagine the pain that Chu Feng was feeling right now.

Grar!

Just then, the palace trembled with even greater intensity, to the point where it looked like it would crumble on itself. Following that was a dragon’s roar so loud that Bai Yunqing thought that his eardrums were going to pop despite his high cultivation.

The power of the exalted dragon in Chu Feng’s formation had vanished, replaced by the power of the saint dragon.

“Damn. I have really met a monster,” Bai Yunqing blurted out with widened eyes.
