Chapter 3294 - Scarlet Province Upper Realm

“Senior, although the eight formations will now remain open forever, the Bloodline Altar is gone. Although we have obtained Bloodline Cultivation Formations forever, we have lost the opportunity to comprehend our bloodline’s power in the Bloodline Altar.”

“Although it might appear as if we’ve gained enormously, we have lost the most important thing, and forfeited our future generations’ opportunity to gain comprehension of their bloodline’s power.”

“As for me, I am actually the final person of our Chu Heavenly Clan to enter the Bloodline Altar. Because of that, I know very well what I shoulder...”

“I will definitely not let down Lord Clan Chief’s expectations. I will also not let down that mysterious excellency’s expectations, and not let down the sacrifice of our clan’s future generations’ opportunity to comprehend their bloodline power.”

“Sooner or later, I will gain control over my bloodline’s power.”

“Merely, I can tell that it will be very difficult to gain control over it. It is most definitely not something that I can accomplish in a short period of time. However, the match against the Fang Heavenly Clan is imminent, and I must quickly increase my strength. Thus... I wish to journey to the Scarlet Province Upper Realm,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re planning to go seek out the mysterious place recorded in the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded. He wanted to increase his cultivation quickly. However, trying to train and cultivate by himself would require a lot of time.

The path of martial cultivation was a path that went against the heavens. If one were to train painstakingly, the effect would be very minimal.

The only shortcut to increasing one’s cultivation quickly was to brave dangers and seek them out. While opportunities would oftentimes be accompanied by dangers, opportunities were shortcuts to increasing one’s cultivation.

However, shortcuts that would increase one’s cultivation were very rare to come by. They were not things that one would definitely obtain just because one sought them out. One must first be fated to encounter them.

Chu Feng was able to reach his current level of cultivation thanks to both his talent and efforts. However, his luck and fortune definitely played a major part too.

Chu Feng could be considered to be a rarely seen cultivator that possessed enormous luck and fortune.

Currently, if he wanted to increase his cultivation quickly, he would have no choice but to take a risk, brave dangers and seek out that mysterious place recorded on the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.

“Very well, this old man will accompany you,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, you must not do that. Not only does our clan require you to oversee it, but you should also be undergoing closed-door training now that the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations are open. You must not divide your attention and energy for my sake, and cause yourself a delay,” Chu Feng hurriedly refused.

He knew very well that the person that the entire Chu Heavenly Clan depended on was their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the person before him.

The Bloodline Cultivation Formations were simply prepared precisely for their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Should he train in them, he would definitely be able to gain a great harvest.

At a time like this, what the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief should do the most was to train, and not to protect Chu Feng.

“You’re rushing to make a breakthrough for the sake of our clan. Should I accompany you, it will also be the sake of our clan. After all... I also do not wish to lose the territory our ancestors left for us,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said with a smile. Then, he patted Chu Feng’s shoulder and said, “This matter is decided then. Return and prepare yourself, we will set off immediately.”

Seeing that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was so determined, Chu Feng no longer attempted to dissuade him. He knew that no matter what he said, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would still proceed for the Scarlet Province Upper Realm. Even if he were to say that he wouldn’t go, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would likely be secretly protecting him.

Rather than going through all the trouble, it was better that they travel together.

Besides, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was a rank five Exalted. With an expert of his level protecting Chu Feng, his journey would definitely be much smoother.

Thus, Chu Feng smiled and said, “Senior, there’s no need for preparations. We can set off right now.”

While Chu Feng didn’t need any preparations, it was not the case for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Thus, they did not leave immediately. It was only after the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief gave some instructions to Chu Hanpeng that he brought Chu Feng with him and left.

Their destination was the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.

There was only a single method to reach the Scarlet Province Upper Realm. That would be through an Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation.

However, the power of the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation was limited. Depending on the distance, there would be a clear difference in the time that the teleportation would take.

Fortunately, the Scarlet Province Upper Realm was not far from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. On top of that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was powerful enough that he was able to activate treasures inside the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation that increased their speed.

Thus, after a short few days, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief arrived at the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.

At the moment he walked out of the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation and set foot upon the earth, Chu Feng gasped in admiration.

He had just crossed the vast starry sky and arrived at this place.

Furthermore, this was not a Lower Realm or an Ordinary Realm. Instead, he had arrived at an Upper Realm.

Most importantly, that Upper Realm was the territory of the Wuma Heavenly Clan. Upon thinking that he would be journeying through the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s territory and very likely plundering treasures from them, Chu Feng started to feel an ineffable sense of excitement.

That said, as Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief walked out of the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation, no one was able to catch sight of them.

The reason for that was because the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Feng did not wish for others to notice them, and had concealed themselves before they even set foot out of the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation.

Because of that, others were simply unable to see Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and continued on with their respective tasks.

There were a lot of people gathered around that Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation.

Those people were in groups of three or four. They were all discussing something. Upon eavesdropping on the crowd’s conversations, Chu Feng realized that they were all discussing the same thing.

It was a strange matter that had recently happened in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.

A couple days ago, two women intruded upon the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area and robbed their cultivation resources.

Those two women should not be people from the Scarlet Province Upper Realm, as no one had ever seen them before. Their identities were simply a mystery.

In the beginning, the people of the Scarlet Province Upper Realm were merely surprised that two women would have the courage to provoke the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

At that time, the people had thought that those two women would soon stop, and would even soon be captured by the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

After all, the two of them were merely people of the younger generation.

However, as the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s territories continued to be breached and their precious resources continued to be robbed by the two women, the matter began to catch people’s attention more and more.

This was especially true after the two women actually managed to breach a territory that was personally guarded by a Supreme Elder of the Wuma Heavenly Clan a while ago.

Not even the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder was able to stop those two women. At that moment, the entire Wuma Heavenly Clan had burst into an uproar.

Practically the entire Scarlet Province Upper Realm was discussing the matter.

The people were pondering exactly who those two women were to actually possess such frightening power.

Could it be that they were from another starfield? After all, apart from Linghu Hongfei, there was no one from the younger generation that was that terrifying.

“It would appear that the Wuma Heavenly Clan is undergoing some sort of trouble,” As the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he looked to Chu Feng and asked, “Chu Feng, what do you think about this matter?”

“This junior thinks that those two women are most likely not really people of the younger generation. It is very possible that they’re people from another Upper Realm that have deliberately disguised themselves,” Chu Feng analyzed.

“Mn,” Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded in a satisfied manner. Evidently, he was also thinking what Chu Feng was thinking.

“Let’s go,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not wish to continue staying at that place for long. As he spoke, he planned to bring Chu Feng with him and leave this place.

“Senior, please wait,” However, Chu Feng suddenly gestured with his hand.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was slightly surprised. He looked over to Chu Feng, and discovered Chu Feng, who was relaxed and at ease earlier, suddenly actually had a serious look on his face.

Following Chu Feng’s gaze, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief saw that Chu Feng was looking at someone.
