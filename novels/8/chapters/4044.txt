Chapter 4044 - Favorable Momentum Has Passed?

“Chu Feng, although your talent is no weaker than that of your grandfather and father, there is one aspect in which you’re far inferior to them,” Wuming Doutian shook his head with disappointment as he said those words.

It was only after he said those words that the crowd realized that Wuming Doutian was still the same Wuming Doutian.

The things he’d said to Chu Feng earlier were nothing more than a polite greeting.

What he was about to say was what he really wanted to say.

Although Chu Feng also knew that Wuming Doutian was not going to say anything pleasant, he was still unable to keep himself from asking, “What about me is inferior to my grandfather and father?”

He wanted to hear exactly what that Wuming Doutian wanted to say.

Of course, Chu Feng would not be enraged regardless of what he said.

He merely wanted to know exactly what sort of trick Wuming Doutian had up his sleeve.

“Your father and grandfather are people that would never take advantage of their positions to bully people. They relied on their own strength the entire time,” said Wuming Doutian.

“It’s precisely because they relied on themselves that they ended up being suppressed by you and were forced to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield,” said Chu Feng.

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd all revealed looks of shock.

Even though everyone knew of Wuming Doutian’s despotic rule and how he had suppressed Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan, no one had dared to openly voice those things, much less right in front of Wuming Doutian himself.

Chu Feng’s action... was it not courting death?

“Heh...” Wuming Doutian faintly smiled. It seemed like he had not taken offense to Chu Feng’s words.

He continued, “So you’re actually not only a person who takes advantage of your position to bully others; you’re also someone who makes false accusations against others.”

“As a martial cultivator, one’s talent is very important. However, one’s moral quality is even more important.”

“Chu Feng, I must say that your behavior today has truly disappointed me.”

Wuming Doutian’s smile was very mocking.

Not only did he refuse to admit to what he had done, he instead proclaimed that Chu Feng was making a false accusation.

“It’s not only you that’s disappointed, this old man is also very disappointed.”

Right at that moment, another voice was heard.

Then, an old man appeared.

Once the old man appeared, the expressions of practically everyone present changed enormously.

That old man wore the outfit of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

However, that old man was most definitely not an ordinary member of Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

The reason for that was because he was a renowned individual in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

He was the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s envoy. People all knew him as the Dragon City Envoy.

Whilst the Dragon City Envoy did not possess strength that could rank him amongst the top three individuals in Ancestral Martial Dragon City, his every action represented the city.

It could be said that he was the one individual besides the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master Long Daozhi who could best represent the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

As Long Daozhi was not fond of showing his face in public, it was always the Dragon City Envoy that would represent the Ancestral Martial Dragon City on many important occasions.

As such, the Dragon City Envoy was most definitely someone with enormous authority.

At that moment, the Dragon City Envoy held a scroll in his hand.

On the scroll, the words ‘City Master’s Intentions were written.’

Seeing the scroll, the crowd knew that the Dragon City Envoy had brought the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master Long Daozhi’s decree.

Exactly what kind of decree was it?

The Ancestral Martial Dragon City, the colossus capable of controlling everything, were they planning to aid the Chu Heavenly Clan or the Wuming Clan?

The crowd became endlessly curious and tense.

Whilst the crowd were all guessing, the Dragon City Envoy approached. He landed beside Wuming Doutian.

This caused the Chu Heavenly Clansmen’s hearts to tense up.

After all, this illustrated that the Dragon City Envoy could very possibly be standing on the Wuming Clan’s side.

“Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, listen up. This is the order from our City Master.”

After he finished saying those words, the envoy waved his sleeve, and the scroll was sent into the air.

Then, the scroll began to expand in size. At the same time, it automatically unfolded itself.

Once the scroll opened up, everyone could clearly see the writing on the scroll.

It turned out that Ancestral Martial Dragon City had learned of the Purple Star Hall’s invitation to the ten starfields to gather as guests.

The Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master felt that going there would not only represent one’s own power, but it would also represent the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

As such, he felt that the one to participate in the gathering should be someone capable.

Although the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had managed the Ancestral Martial Starfield very well, his own strength was evidently insufficient to take on such a heavy responsibility.

Because of that, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master had ordered the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to hand the rights to manage the Ancestral Martial Starfield back to Wuming Doutian.

Seeing the contents of the scroll, many Wuming Clansmen smiled complacently.

They all looked to Chu Feng with mocking gazes.

There were even people among them that began to send voice transmissions to insult him.

“Little bastard, weren’t you acting arrogantly earlier?”

“Weren’t you taking advantage of your position to bully us?”

“Look at this, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City is no longer concerning themselves with your Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Even they are ordering you all to hand over the starfield’s overlord position.”

“What are you going to do now?”

“Come, weren’t you demanding an explanation? Why don’t you go ahead and try doing so?”

“Trash. You’re nothing more than trash that only takes advantage of your position to bully others.”

“Without the backing of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, you’re nothing more than useless trash.”

Those Wuming Clansmen relinquished all their fear towards Chu Feng now that he no longer possessed the backing of Ancestral Martial Dragon City. All sorts of unpleasant words rained down on Chu Feng like a torrential storm.

It was not only the Wuming Clansmen. Many of the bystanders were also looking at Chu Feng with delight at his misfortune.

However, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. He was also very quiet.

He was also very calm.

But, the others did not see his calmness for what it was.

In their eyes, Chu Feng was not being calm at all.

Rather, he was reacting like someone who had received an enormous shock.

They believed that Chu Feng, now without backing, no longer knew what to do and had been scared speechless.

Even though those bystanders did not verbally attack Chu Feng like the Wuming Clansmen, they were still ridiculing him in their hearts.

Whilst they’d admitted that Chu Feng was talented, they were disgusted with how he had tried to kick the Wuming Clan around with his position.

“Clan Chief Chu, do you accept Lord City Master’s decree?” The Dragon City’s Envoy asked with a stern voice.

“This old man accepts,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief replied with a respectful bow.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief reacted very humbly before the Dragon City’s Envoy.

“Since you’ve accepted it, hand over the invitation letter.”

“That letter is not something that you can hold on to.”

The Dragon City Envoy’s tone was extremely mocking. He was clearly looking down on the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

However, no one felt that he was wrong. After all, practically everyone felt the same way he did. In fact, many Chu Heavenly Clansmen also felt that way.

Even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief himself felt that way.

Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not intend to resist at all, and immediately took out the invitation letter from his bosom.

[1. I noticed that I’ve used ‘bosom’ multiple times when people take things out or put things away. Not sure if I’ve ever explained things. Traditional east asian clothes do not have pockets. Instead, items are hidden within sleeves and the bosom/chest portion of the clothes. It’s kinda like how many suits and jackets have inner chest pockets? Traditional east asian clothes also end with a ‘y’ shaped lapel of sorts. So you can literally put one hand into the chest and take out stuff. Or at least that’s how they show it in the tv shows I used to watch maybe 10-15 years ago.]

He cautiously stepped forward. With an extremely humble and respectful attitude, he soared into the air, fully intending to personally hand the invitation letter to Wuming Doutian.

This scene was being observed by everyone present.

Some sighed in pity. Some felt sad. However, the majority took joy in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s misfortune.

After all, no one had thought highly of the Chu Heavenly Clan from the very start. They had all believed they were not qualified to manage the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

However, no one would’ve expected the Chu Heavenly Clan’s rule of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to end so quickly.

Furthermore, their rule had ended in such a low and miserable manner.

However, this just so happened to be what many people wanted to see.

They all wanted to see the miserable appearance of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Because of that, mocking voices could be heard from the crowd.

The people that had only dared to spectate and not say anything earlier, had all begun to mock the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“In a world where might is right, strength is everything. This Chu Heavenly Clan is truly lamentable.”

“Lamentable? The way I see it, it serves them right. Without strength, they should’ve never attempted to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord. Yet, they actually took on the position. Oh how thick-skinned they are.”

“This is what is meant by being excessively big-headed. They failed to recognize their own standing and really thought that they were the strongest in the entire starfield.”

“Earlier, he acted like he would rather die than submit. Yet now, he’s capitulating? Sure enough, his integrity earlier was nothing more than a pretense. Without the backing of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, his real identity is fully unmasked. Now he’s going to wag his tail and beg for mercy.”

The people that came to the Chu Heavenly Clan with the intention of paying them respect were actually starting to openly ridicule the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

It was naturally the Wuming Clan that gave them the courage to do so.

As the saying goes, ‘everyone will push a falling wall.’

After witnessing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s favorable momentum coming to an end, the great majority of the crowd had decided to stand with the Wuming Clan.

......

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief began to tremble.

He was not afraid. Rather, he was angered by the comments of those people.

Thinking back, after he became the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he had tried his hardest to maintain order, and even used time that he should have used for training to work on the matters of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Furthermore, as long as people came to pay their respects, regardless of whether they were powerful or not, he would always receive them Courteously.

He did all that with the hope of winning over the people’s hearts and gaining their acknowledgement.

He wanted them to know that even though he was not the strongest, he would still be able to properly manage the Ancestral Martial Starfield by being fair and just. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

In fact, he was certain that he would be able to make the Ancestral Martial Starfield even more peaceful than before.

Yet, never did he imagine that his sincerity towards everyone would be met with such sarcastic remarks.

It turned out that from the very start, no one had really acknowledged him.

The people that had been very respectful and reverent towards him had all been looking down on him in their hearts.

Once he’d lost his authority and power, they’d immediately changed faces.

The people that had been trying to curry favors from him before began to spout malicious remarks and insult him in the blink of an eye.

This brought him great sadness. He was incomparably disappointed. He began to think that perhaps he had made a mistake, that perhaps he shouldn’t have been so friendly to everyone.

After all, even if one were sincere towards others, one might not necessarily be able to receive sincerity from others in return.

......

Seeing that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was starting to tremble, the crowd did not realize that their words were the cause, that their words were the source of his great disappointment.

Instead, they all felt that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was scared. Because of that, their insults grew even more intense.

“Paa~~~”

Suddenly, a hand landed on the invitation letter.

Then, that hand actually snatched away the invitation letter from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s hand.

The crowd were all astonished to see this scene.

The reason for that was because the person who had taken the invitation letter was none other than Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing?”

Many people asked with stern voices.

Chu Feng smiled at the crowd’s questions.

“Since the starfield’s overlord status should be held by those who are capable, it would make it even more so that I cannot hand it over to the Wuming Clan.”

“The starfield’s overlord seat will still be held by our Chu Heavenly Clan,” said Chu Feng.
