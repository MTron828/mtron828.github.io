MGA: Chapter 891 - Commencing a Massacre

“I’ve got it. As expected, our master guessed correctly. Lady Qiushui is Qiushui Fuyan. You didn’t go to the Holy Land of Martialism, and had always remained in the Eastern Sea Region.”

Finally, the Sixth Immortal’s expression was slightly relieved. He sneered, seeming to understand what had happened in the past, then quickly said, “If I’m not mistaken, you’ve come here today likely for Chu Feng.

“But, Qiushui Fuyan, there has never been any enmity between my Immortal Execution Archipelago and your Burning Heaven Church. If you side with a brat like Chu Feng, you will make an enemy out of us. You must carefully think about the interests and detriments!”

“Since you know the reason I’ve come, why the useless question?” Qiushui Fuyan faintly smiled at the Sixth Immortal’s words, then added, “Also, don’t threaten me, because I have never been afraid of your Immortal Execution Archipelago.

“In the end, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is merely a force that used all sorts of despicable methods to rise in position amidst the power-struggle chaos, and you were only able to because there was no one powerful in the Eastern Sea Region. Who gave you the courage to dare to threaten me?”

“You...” The Sixth Immortal was not lightly angered at all. He didn’t think Qiushui Fuyan would give no face at all by humiliating the Immortal Execution Archipelago in public.

“Everyone, the ‘good show’ is over. I’m sure all of you have also seen the true appearance of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.

“This force that raises a banner of righteousness is in reality the most despicable power. In comparison to the Crippling Night Demon Sect, who are outright and dares to claim responsibility for all the things they’ve done, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is truly unworthy to be the Eastern Sea Region’s ruler.

“Everyone, go your own ways, but don’t forget to tell the world what happened today. It will also act as a warning for everyone to not blindly join the Immortal Execution Archipelago, and jump into this huge hellhole that does every evil thing imaginable.”

“Thank you for saving us today! We will not disappoint your wishes. We will tell the world today’s truth!”

After Qiushui Fuyan spoke, the observers felt endless gratitude. They clasped their hands, and after thanking together, they leapt forth and used all sorts of ability to flee into the distance. In order to avoid being captured in one net, they did not escape in one direction, but instead scattered and it was every person for themselves.

“Today, no one should even think of leaving!” The Sixth Immortal’s face turned cold when he saw their attempts. His overwhelming bloodlust was let out, and in an instant, black clouds appeared in the clear sky, gales arose, and it was as if the end of the world had arrived.

“You don’t decide if they leave or not.” However, Qiushui Fuyan, who had her eyes on the Sixth Immortal, did not give him a chance to kill them.

She raised her pure-white hand slightly in the air, and after a huge explosion, she willed into existence flames that could touch the sky itself. They became a blazing ocean of fire, submerging the Sixth Immortal within.

“Dammit!” When there was an attack from a rank one Martial King heading his way, how could the Sixth Immortal distract himself by chasing after others? He quickly flipped his palm and released a powerful martial skill to block Qiushui Fuyan’s flames.

*aoo—* Seeing the Sixth Immortal stopped by Qiushui Fuyan, the Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan also fiercely shouted and became enormous birds with a body ablaze with flames. They looked exactly like the huge bird seen back then in the continent of the Nine Provinces.

After the two Protectors transformed into their original appearances, a sky full of flames gushed out. The flames pressed forth in all directions; they wanted to burn the people who were escaping to death.

“If you want to kill them, you must first pass through us!” The Water King and Fire King, who had rested for quite a while, didn’t hesitate as they released their unique power of water and fire. First, they blocked their ferocious flames, then they started fighting the Inferno Divine Bird clan’s Protectors once again. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“KILL—” With the eruption of battle, everyone from both sides did not waste any time as all the experts from the Immortal Execution Archipelago started bellowing “kill”, and all leapt out from the warships.

Although no one dared to interfere in the fights between Martial Kings—they even had to stay far away from them—they still dared to interfere in the fights between Martial Lords. At that instant, several thousand Martial Lords surrounded Chu Feng. They wanted to suppress Chu Feng with numbers and bully the few with more.

Even though an entire warship of Martial Lords pounced towards Chu Feng, there was also a portion who headed towards Xuan Xiaochao and the others, including the injured Ten Gold-cloak Brothers. They truly prepared to kill all of them.

“None of you are worthy of killing us.”

Due to Chu Feng’s assistance with healing, and his own as well, the injuries on Xuan Xiaochao and the others had turned quite a bit for the better. Even You Tonghan’s cut jaw and tongue, with Xuan Xiaochao and Fu Fengming’s help, were restored.

They were already brimming with anger, and now, there were people who looked for trouble. The three had found their targets to vent their fury.

All of them grasped within their hands an Incomplete Royal Armament. They sent out ferocious auras, and rushed into the battlefield. As if they were cutting fruits and vegetables, they started killing the army of the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Even though they were all Martial Lords, the three’s powerful strength had been displayed perfectly. Although they were no match for Murong Xun, it was relatively easy to kill those people.

“Formation!”

The young ones bravely slaughtered their enemies, so naturally the old ones could not do anything inferior. Even though the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers were heavily injured, without the suppression from the Sixth Immortal, they acted as if they were revived. They too set out powerful fighting strength, and after laying their unique formation, they attacked with defense, quietly awaiting the arrival of the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s army.

Let alone these normal Martial Lord, their formation could even put up a fight against Murong Xun who had a Royal Armament!

Even though there was a large number of people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, and they too were in a formation, the ten old men calmly received the arrival of attacks. With flawless coordination, they became fierce beasts. Regardless how many came, they killed them all. The experts’ offensive attacks were akin to committing suicide. It was only a one-way path as they all became pools of blood.

If the heavily wounded Xuan Xiaochao and the others, and the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers, were so brave and ferocious, then one could imagine how much more relentless Chu Feng was, who was uninjured and possessed outstanding strength.

At that moment, Chu Feng was simply like a slaughtering weapon. With him in the center, within a circumference of a thousand meters, it was like a bloody colosseum.

Those who stepped within that range would instantly be butchered. Not only instantly killed, even their Source Energy was refined by Chu Feng.

“AHH—”

In an instant, all sorts of painful cries rang out. Blood was like rain as it showered downward. The over ten thousand Martial Lords on the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s three warships were unable to kill Chu Feng and the others. Instead, they were like animals as they were slaughtered instead.
