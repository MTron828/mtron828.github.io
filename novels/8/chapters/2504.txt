Chapter 2504 - The Bamboo Slip Snatched Away

“Not bad, seems like you still remember your Lord Tiger,” Seeing that Chu Feng recognized it, the old cat smiled even more vulgarly.

How could Chu Feng not remember it? Back at the Sunset Cloud Valley, it was precisely that old cat who messed with Zhan Haichuan’s tomb.

All of the treasures Zhan Haichuan had left behind had been plundered by the old cat.

Chu Feng had originally thought that the old cat had already left the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Never did he expect that not only had the old cat not left, it had also arrived there.

“The sudden uncalled-for appearance of this forbidden area the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip was sealed in is related to you?” Chu Feng asked.

“Hehe, of course it’s related to your Lord Tiger. If it wasn’t for your Lord Tiger, who else in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm could possibly be able to find this place that the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip was hidden in?”

“That said, the original owner of this place was truly quite remarkable. Even for your Lord Tiger, it still took him two entire years to make this place reveal itself. This place has truly wasted quite a lot of my time.”

“Fortunately, the heavens do not let down those who are determined. In the end, your Lord Tiger succeeded.”

“That said, to tell the truth, it is all thanks to you that I could obtain the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip this smoothly,” As the old cat smiled, it turned its vulgar gaze toward the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip in Chu Feng’s hand.

Seeing this, Chu Feng hurriedly held his hand tightly, containing the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip within his hand.

He did not care whether or not this place was brought forth by the old cat, all he cared about was that he had promised the Golden Crane True Immortal this God Bestowment Bamboo Slip.

Thus, he naturally did not wish for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip to end up in the old cat’s paws.

“You...”

However, Chu Feng’s expression soon changed. His hand that he was holding tightly onto the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip actually started to involuntarily open itself. Then, he was only able to look on as the God bestowment Bamboo Slip floated away from his palm and entered the old cat’s paw.

At this moment, Chu Feng came to a deep realization of the difference in strength between him and that old cat.

Before the old cat, not to mention trying to contend against it, even his own body was no longer under his control. That old cat was able to control him with merely a thought.

Holding the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip with its paw, the old cat said with a beaming smile, “Boy, don’t hold what does not belong to you. This thing here will bring you a fatal calamity.”

“Thus, it is safer for it to be placed with Your Lord Tiger.”

“This is robbery!” Chu Feng said angrily.

“That’s right, I am robbing you, what can you possibly do about it?” The old cat laughed mockingly. Then, it said, “If you are displeased with this, you are very welcome to come search for this Lord Tiger in the future. Merely, I’m afraid that you will not have the ability to do so,” After the old cat finished saying those words, it clenched its paw, and the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip disappeared.

Although Chu Feng had no idea where the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip had disappeared to, he knew for sure that it had been put away by the old cat.

“Boy, your Lord Tiger is going to leave this place where even birds don’t shit. We will never meet again.”

[1. A place where even birds don’t shit → extremely desolate place. Seems like it was originally ‘A place where birds don’t lay eggs and dogs don’t shit.’]

After the old cat said those words, it turned around and waved its paw at Chu Feng while pulling at the shackles with its other paw as it returned to the crimson mist.

“Where are you taking her?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng knew very well that the old cat was an insurmountable mountain to the current him. It would be impossible for him to snatch back the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip from the old cat.

Thus, at that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Xue Ji. He had no idea how Xue Ji had become that old cat’s prisoner.

However, it remained that Xue Ji was related to him. Thus, Chu Feng wanted to know what the old cat planned to do to Xue Ji.

“You’re talking about this doll? This doll here is an Asura World Spirit. As a world spiritist, you should know very well that when a world spirit leaves its master, it should turn into an Evil Spirit. However, this doll is still a world spirit and not an Evil Spirit,” The old cat said.

“Still a world spirit?” Chu Feng was greatly astonished.

Chu Feng had no idea about the current Xue Ji. However, he was certain that Xue Ji had been an Evil Spirit at one point.

In other words, Xue Ji had used some sort of method to turn herself into an ordinary world spirit from an Evil Spirit.

Regardless of how she managed to accomplish that, it remained an unimaginable feat.

“This Great Lord has always wanted to find an extraordinary slave. I just so happened to run into her. An Asura World Spirit with extraordinary beauty, it is perfect to have her as my slave.”

“It must be said that even though this is a place where even the birds don’t shit, your Lord Tiger’s journey here has garnered quite a harvest,” The old cat spoke proudly.

“She’s going to be your slave?”

Chu Feng finally understood why Xue Ji had such a depressed expression on her face. With how proud she was, she would naturally not be willing to become someone’s slave.

Otherwise, how could the Xue Ji from back then be so unwilling to serve Chu Feng?

“That said, boy, it seems like you know this doll. She couldn’t possibly have escaped from your world spirit space, right?” Suddenly, the old cat looked to Chu Feng very profoundly.

From the old cat’s gaze, Chu Feng felt an extremely dangerous sensation.

This old cat seemed to be planning to kill Chu Feng. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Haha, forget about it. Boy, it could be said that you’ve helped this Great Lord enormously today.”

“If it wasn’t for you, this Great Lord would truly not have been able to obtain the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip so smoothly. Thus, this Great Lord will not punish you today.”

As the old cat spoke, it stepped into the crimson mist. Following that, Xue Ji who was tied up in chains, was also pulled into the crimson mist.

Chu Feng had been staring at Xue Ji the entire time. Thus, he noticed that in the moment she was pulled into the crimson mist, an expression of despair emerged in her eyes.

For some unknown reason, Chu Feng’s heart tightened at that moment.

He felt tense, as if his close friends or relatives were being captured. He was actually worried.

Merely, Chu Feng didn’t understand why he would be worried for Xue Ji.

This Xue Ji was different from Eggy. She was a complete maverick. In fact, Chu Feng was deeply on guard against her before.

Without mentioning anything else, it remained that Xue Ji had tried to take Chu Feng’s life before.

Even though Xue Ji used to be his world spirit, she had never served him, and was instead very hateful toward him. Thus, to be more exact, Xue Ji was more like Chu Feng’s enemy.

This was precisely the reason why Chu Feng was confused as to why he would worry for an enemy.

Could it be that it was because Xue Ji was, after all, his world spirit, that this was some sort of spiritual connection?

“Huu, huu, huu~~~”

Right at that moment, the crimson gaseous flames started to rise into the sky.

Evidently, that old cat had left with Xue Ji.

“Putt~~~”

As for Chu Feng, he was finally unable to continue supporting himself; he half kneeled onto the ground.

“Chu Feng.”

At the moment Chu Feng kneeled onto the ground, a figure appeared before him to lend him an arm for support. That person was naturally the Golden Crane True Immortal.

“Senior Golden Crane, I...” Chu Feng looked to the Golden Crane True Immortal. Guilt filled his heart. He wanted to apologize.

“Don’t speak for now,” However, the Golden Crane True Immortal refused to allow Chu Feng to speak. He did not want to hear what Chu Feng wanted to say.

Instead, he surrounded Chu Feng with his spirit power and began to whole-heartedly focus on healing Chu Feng’s injuries.
