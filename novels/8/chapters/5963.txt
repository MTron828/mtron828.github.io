Chapter 5964: Shocked By the True Prodigy

“It’s too early to celebrate. You need to prove yourself worthy of working with me,” Chu Feng said.

With a wave of his sleeves, he conjured a map indicating the location of three formations.

“Call your clansmen to use my formation deciphering key to decipher these three formations. You have an hour to do so. If you can’t do it within an hour, don’t blame me for casting you aside,” Chu Feng said.

“Mm!” Tongling Yueyue nodded. She formed a hand seal, and her whiskers began to quiver. “Young hero Chu Feng, I have sent the message out.”

“Your clansmen are in the vicinity?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, I have been constantly asking for help while escaping, and they were on their way over. They are quite close to us now,” Tongling Yueyue replied.

“All right. I’ll wait an hour for them.” Chu Feng constructed a concealment formation on the spot and sat down.

“Young hero Chu Feng, aren’t we going to find somewhere else to seek refuge?” Tongling Yueyue was worried.

“There’s no need for that.”

“What if the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion sends someone over? Those three will surely send word back.”

“They dare not do so.”

Tongling Yueyue was skeptical, so she continued to vigilantly eye the surroundings. In contrast, Chu Feng looked confident.

Time quickly passed. Just as an hour was about to be up, Tongling Yueyue’s eyes lit up.

“Young hero Chu Feng...”

Before she could finish her words, Chu Feng stood up and said, “It looks like they succeeded. Since that’s the case, have your clansmen decipher these three formations.”

Chu Feng conjured another map indicating the locations of three formations.

“All right.” Tongling Yueyue formed a hand seal and sent the message out once more.

“Tell your clansmen to use this formation deciphering key to decipher the formation this time,” Chu Feng said as he took out a brand new formation deciphering key.

“Why?” Tongling Yueyue was confused.

“Why are you so dumb?” Chu Feng chuckled.

“Ah? Wait, was the previous formation deciphering key fake? This one is the real one?” It finally clicked for Tongling Yueyue.

“Of course. It’s our first time meeting, and I’m not close to you. Why would I hand over my formation deciphering key to you just like that? It’s important to stay vigilant. You understand that, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“I do understand it, but young hero Chu Feng... that isn’t what you said earlier. You said that trust is important in partnerships!” Tongling Yueyue pouted.

“That’s why it’s important to be vigilant. Don’t waste time and get your clansmen to quickly decipher the formations.” Chu Feng stood up and headed deeper into the remnant.

Tongling Yueyue hurriedly followed him.

Soon, Chu Feng arrived before a formation.

He constructed a deciphering formation, but he didn’t fully activate it. Instead, he constructed a concealment formation to hide the deciphering formation. Then, he made his way to the other formations and did the same too.

He repeated this for four different formations.

“Young hero Chu Feng, why are you constructing deciphering formations but not activating them?” Tongling Yueyue finally voiced her confusion.

“I have already activated them,” Chu Feng replied.

“But you didn’t fully activate them.”

“I am biding my time.”

Tongling Yueyue frowned. A moment later, she hesitantly said, “Young hero Chu Feng, I don’t mean any disrespect when I say this, but this remnant isn’t as simple as it seems. You mustn’t let your guard down.

“Don’t worry. I don’t let my guard down easily,” Chu Feng confidently replied.

He led Tongling Yueyue to a place that appeared to be a dead end and constructed a concealment formation before settling down. Tongling Yueyue was confused, but she dared not to probe into what he was doing.

Soon, her face lit up.

“Young hero Chu Feng, my clansmen have deciphered the three formations!”

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded. He formed four hand seals before standing up to face the dead end.

“Aren’t you curious as to what I’m doing?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am curious, but it’s important to remain vigilant. I understand why you might be hesitant to share the details with me,” Tongling Yueyue replied with a smile.

“It’s nothing much. It’s because we’re going to venture deeper into the remnant.”

“Venture deeper?” Tongling Yueyue was confused.

“You have been here many times, so you must know how to venture deeper into the remnant.”

“Are you looking for a path? Young hero Chu Feng, feel free to ask me anything. I know about the nine paths that lead deep into the remnant, as well as the paths that your mother and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master took. I’d be happy to share those details with you since we’re in a partnership. It might help you to avoid detours,” Tongling Yueyue said.

“Do you think I’m taking a detour now?”

“T-that’s not what I mean, but based on what I know, there are only nine paths to venture deep into the remnant. I’m thinking that since I know all nine paths, we could...” Tongling Yueyue was in the midst of her explanation when her eyes suddenly bulged.

A formation had appeared on the wall in front of her. Spirit power rippled, and the wall vanished.

A brand new path appeared before them.

“H-how is this possible? Could it be...” Tongling Yueyue stared at Chu Feng with widened eyes.

Such a thing would only happen if someone was forging a new path, but two conditions had to be fulfilled for that.

One, the person had to decipher at least ten formations in the correct sequence.

Two, the person had to break the record of the previous record holder.

There were multiple correct sequences for the formation deciphering, but some were more efficient than others.

The previous record holder was Jie Ranqing. She deciphered a mere twelve formations before a new path to the remnant's core opened up. This was an extremely difficult record to break.

In contrast, the record holder before her, Jie Tianran, had to decipher eighteen formations before forging a new path.

To break Jie Ranqing’s record, Chu Feng had to find a correct sequence within eleven formations. This was a nigh impossible feat, and everyone thought that there was no way to break Jie Ranqing’s record.

Naturally, no one thought about forging a new path anymore.

However, the impossible had happened before her eyes.

“Young hero Chu Feng, y-you have already deciphered eleven formations?” Tongling Yueyue looked at Chu Feng in disbelief.

It had only been half a day since Chu Feng entered the chess door, but he had already found the correct sequence—and his sequence was superior to Jie Ranqing’s! This was unbelievable.

No one would believe it, even if it was Chu Feng they were talking about here.

“It’s ten formations,” Chu Feng said.

“Ten formations?” Tongling Yueyue was taken aback.

Forging a new path within ten formations meant that Chu Feng had found the perfect sequence.

“Three of them are your credit,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Wait... You have deciphered those four formations we passed by earlier according to the sequence too?” Tongling Yueyue stared at Fang Chen with huge eyes.

“That’s right.” Chu Feng nodded.

Tongling Yueyue’s lower jaws slackened.

This meant that Chu Feng had remotely activated those deciphering formations he had left behind after receiving the news that her clansmen had successfully deciphered the three formations entrusted to them.

It was possible to remotely activate formation, but it was not that easy to pull it off.

She was a world spiritist too, so she did wonder if Chu Feng was planning to remotely activate those deciphering formations. However, simultaneously activating the deciphering formations and ensuring that they were cleared in the correct sequence was no easy feat.

It was practically impossible.

Not to mention it was Chu Feng’s first time deciphering those formations. It was unthinkable for him to have such a deep understanding of them.

Yet, Chu Feng pulled it off.

He forged a new path within ten formations with his extraordinary discernment. This was a feat that required perfection in every single step. The slightest mistake would result in his failure.

“Young hero Chu Feng, y-you...” Tongling Yueyue stuttered nonstop. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked.

“I-I-I finally understand what a true prodigy is,” Tongling Yueyue said in resignation.
