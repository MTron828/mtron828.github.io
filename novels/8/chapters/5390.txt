Chapter 5390: Worsening Relations

Chu Feng returned to his accommodations.

The prison guard was nowhere to be seen, but Chu Feng knew that the other party was still lurking outside the palace, spying on his movements.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Weng!

A surge of spirit power suddenly enveloped Chu Feng, and a small hand reached forth and clasped Chu Feng’s mouth.

“Shh, don’t speak,” a voice transmission was relayed to him.

It was Ling Sheng’er, but she was wearing a unique cloak that concealed her presence.

“What brings you here?” Chu Feng was surprised.

“I heard that Bai Yunqing has been captured. I tried sneaking into the prison to save him, but someone was guarding him. However, I overheard your conversation with Shuang Yu. Listen to me, I can bring you out of here. Just come with me. I’ll find a way to save Bai Yunqing.”

Ling Sheng’er took out a Cosmos Sack and passed it to Chu Feng. “This is all I can get for the time being. If you need more, I’ll find a way to gather more for you.”

Chu Feng opened the Cosmos Sack and saw four Life Crystals inside.

“Come, I’ll take you out of here first.” Ling Sheng’er extended her cloak to cover Chu Feng as well.

Chu Feng could tell that this cloak was imbued with a formidable concealment formation, which was why neither he nor Lord Shuang Yu noticed her earlier in the prison.

“Miss Sheng’er, I appreciate your goodwill, but Bai Yunqing is my brother. I can’t leave him to the lurch.” Chu Feng accepted the Life Crystals, but he had no intention of fleeing.

“Chu Feng, I said that I’ll find a way to save Bai Yunqing. Besides, you should know that they are targeting you! They won’t do anything to Bai Yunqing anymore once you’re gone. Only if you’re alive will Bai Yunqing live!” Ling Sheng’er said.

“Miss Sheng’er, I’ll solve this problem myself. You don’t have to worry about me,” Chu Feng replied.

“Chu Feng, are you really intending to shoulder such humiliation? What they are doing will completely soil your reputation. That will affect you for many years to come! Someone of your talents shouldn’t become that trash Jie Zhou’s stepping stone!” Ling Sheng’er exclaimed.

“Miss Sheng’er, I have already made up my mind. You need not convince me any further,” Chu Feng said.

“Why are you so obstinate?”

Ling Sheng’er stared at Chu Feng in confusion. She didn’t think that he was a foolish person, but he was making an awfully foolish decision here.

Chu Feng didn’t bother explaining his action to her but instead said, “Miss Sheng’er, if you truly wish to help me, I do have a favor to ask for you. Could you help me check where is this place?”

Chu Feng drew out the spirit formation gate he had seen in the scroll.

Ling Sheng’er spent a few seconds looking at it before shaking her head. “I’ve never seen this palace before. Do you have any further details about this place so that I can investigate it?”

“Miss Sheng’er, I’ll be honest with you,” Chu Feng said as he stowed the scroll. “I previously said that I didn’t receive any benefits from the Hidden Land when your big sister asked about it. I lied. I didn’t want others to know that I cleared the Hidden Land lest the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion come after me. In truth, I received a scroll.

“The scroll brought me into a spatial realm, where I had to clear a trial. The reward for clearing the trial was another scroll, and the spirit formation gate I just drew out was the hint.”

Chu Feng took out the scroll and showed it to Ling Sheng’er.

“You’re thinking that this place might contain the Ancient Palace’s secret?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

“Exactly,” Chu Feng replied.

“It must be. I heard that Lord Jie Ranqing also received a scroll back then, and it led to a place where only she could enter. Your scroll might be leading you to that place too,” Ling Sheng’er said.

“Oh? Lord Jie Ranqing also received a scroll?” Chu Feng was surprised.

“It was just a rumor, and Lord Jie Ranqing never admitted to it either. However, she would frequent this location after clearing the final stage of the Ancient Palace, and there would be a noticeable rise in her spirit power every time she leaves.

“However, I think that the rumor should be reliable as it came from Lord Jie Ranqing’s close friend. That person was even severely punished later on for divulging the information,” Ling Sheng’er said.

“Such a thing happened?” Chu Feng thought that there was some credibility to the rumor too.

This piece of knowledge sparked his excitement. If his mother had been to the spirit formation gate too, he might just be able to find traces of her there.

Ling Sheng’er took another close look at the scroll. She seemed to be extremely interested in it.

“Miss Sheng’er, I know that I’m putting you in a spot by making this request of you, but I hope that you can help me look into it,” Chu Feng said.

“What’s difficult about this? If not for you, we would have all died in the Hidden Land. This place doesn’t truly belong to us even though we’re occupying this land. It’s only right for those who are worthy to claim the benefits here. Give me a moment, Chu Feng. I’ll give you an answer very soon!” Ling Sheng’er said before leaving the palace.

Thanks to her invisibility cloak, she was able to avoid the notice of the guard outside.

After Ling Sheng’er left, Chu Feng awakened the four Life Crystals in the Cosmos Sack and used them to treat Eggy’s injuries. The energy of the four Life Crystals was incredible. Eggy was able to recover a fair bit of her cultivation.

They were making good progress even though Eggy was still far from returning to her peak.

“Eggy, I swear that I’ll cure you,” Chu Feng said.

However, Eggy looked a little worried. “Chu Feng, what do you intend to do now? Are you really going to do as they said?”

“Mmhm,” Chu Feng replied.

“You don’t have to do that. Didn’t the Divine Deer say that she’ll help you? You can use her power to save Bai Yunqing. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion won’t be able to stop you,” Eggy said.

“That won’t work. They’ll just pin everything on me if I escape with Bai Yunqing right now. Our reputation will still be sullied. Once I’m gone, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion will be free to say whatever they want about us,” Chu Feng replied.

“What are your plans then?” Eggy asked.

“I might not be able to defeat Lord Shuang Yu, but Jie Zhou is a different story. I’ll give him a good pummeling before escaping.”

“That is a fine plan,” Eggy agreed with a chuckle.

They would have no trouble escaping anyway since they had the Divine Deer to fall back on. Since it was no longer possible to mend relations with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, they might as well just take it to the very end.
