Chapter 5783: A Clan’s Backing

Pah! Pah! Pah! Pah!

A crisp clapping sound echoed from Huangfu Shengyu. He looked at Chu Feng with a smile, but the crowd could sense that he harbored malicious intentions.

“Incredible. I never thought you could trigger this fortuitous encounter. Chu Feng, do you know what’s above you?” Huangfu Shengyu asked.

“Regardless of what it is, it has nothing to do with you,” Little Fishy said.

Huangfu Shengyu ignored Little Fishy and instead turned to the crowd around them and asked, “Have you heard of the Genesis Bloodline?”

“Genesis Bloodline?”

Many of the juniors present were stunned to hear that. They were from powerhouses, so they had heard rumors about the Genesis Bloodline. It was a formidable energy hidden inside the Bloodline Galaxy.

Huangfu Shengyu could tell from their reactions they had heard about the Genesis Bloodline. “You aren’t as ignorant as I thought. No one has grasped the Genesis Bloodline so far because it is strict in selecting its master. Chu Feng might have triggered this fortuitous encounter, but he won’t be able to tame it. I, Huangfu Shengyu, am the person with the greatest odds of making the Genesis Bloodline submit!”

“You? What gives you confidence?” Long Chengyu sneered.

“I am the possessor of the Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline,” Huangfu Shengyu replied.

“Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline? You mean the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline that was forced to kneel before my Brother Chu Feng on the bloodline dueling ring?” Long Chengyu said with a mocking laugh.

Qin Xuan and the others burst into laughter too.

“You must be tired of living!”

Huangfu Jiangyao and Huangfu Shangyang glared at the crowd, ready to make a move on Huangfu Shengyu’s command. They had heard about the Genesis Bloodline too, and there was no way they would let something this precious slip past their fingers. They were fine with taking a back seat thus far, but not anymore.

A battle between the Huangfus and Chu Feng’s group was inevitable.

“Wait.” Huangfu Shengyu stopped them. He was still smiling, but his smile carried malevolent intent that unnerved the others. It was as if he was confident that he had everything in his grasp. “Chu Feng, hand this fortuitous encounter to me, and I’ll do my best to treat you and guarantee you a life of fortune.”

“What nonsense are you spouting? That kind of power is usually fused inside a cultivator’s soul. Forcefully extracting it will cost him his life, and you want him to hand this fortuitous encounter to you? You must be out of your mind!” Feng Ling scoffed.

“I know that. That’s why I said that I’ll do my best to treat him,” Huangfu Shengyu said.

Boom!

A towering wave suddenly rose out of nowhere and crashed down on Huangfu Shengyu and the others.

Little Fishy had made her move. She even raised her cultivation to rank nine Half-God level to ensure that she could kill Huangfu Shengyu in this single move.

Boom!

The attack was stopped before it could even reach Huangfu Shengyu.

“This feeling!”

The crowd sensed that something had gone awry. Even Chu Feng frowned as well.

“Do you sense it?”

Huangfu Shengyu looked at Chu Feng and the others with a smile. His hands were pressed together to form a seal, and his robe fluttered under the wind. A True God level cultivator’s oppressive might weighed from the sky.

“True God? How did he reach True God level? Did he conceal his cultivation?”

The crowd was unnerved. The oppressive might wasn’t directed at them, but there was no doubt it belonged to a True God level cultivator.

“You must have resorted to special means,” Chu Feng said.

“I did,” Huangfu Shengyu replied.

He opened his hands, revealing an ancient crystalline token containing the word ‘Bestowment’. This token carried an aura similar to that of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. The token seeped into his chest and fused as one with him.

“You’re talented, Chu Feng, but sometimes talent isn’t enough. Clan backing is what matters most of the time. This token is from Huangfu Yutian, an ancestor of our Huangfu Heavenly Clan. Elder Huangfu Yutian participated in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith back then. His iteration was filled with formidable prodigies, similar to ours. He defeated the other juniors and was given a choice as the final victor. He chose to relinquish his reward so his descendants could have an advantage in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith in the future.

“Our clansmen will always bring this token whenever we participate in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, but we have never used it because there has never been a fortuitous encounter worth using this token. We weren’t planning to use it this time either since it’s a precious treasure Elder Huangfu Yutian relinquished his reward in order to give us a boost when we require it.

“Who could have thought you’d awaken the legendary energy, Genesis Bloodline? This is the fortuitous encounter our Huangfu Heavenly Clan has been waiting for all this while. It’s time to reveal the ace we have hidden up our sleeves thus far. I really ought to thank you, Chu Feng,” Huangfu Shengyu said with a smile.

Chu Feng eyed the token bearing the word ‘Bestowment’. The token was clearly the reason behind Huangfu Shengyu’s rank one True God level cultivation, but to make things worse, he could sense that Huangfu Shengyu hadn’t fully unleashed the power of the token.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The token likely contained other powers too, but he couldn’t tell what they were.
