Chapter 5134: The Secret of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Forbidden Land

Chu Feng realized that a picture had appeared above the big gate. It was incomplete, showing just a small portion of its entirety, but he could still sense the tremendous energy harnessed within it.

“Chu Feng, are you able to tell what that is?” Yu Sha asked.

“I’m afraid not.” Chu Feng shook his head before asking, “Yu Sha, when did that thing appear?”

“I’m not too sure. It wasn’t there prior to your battle with the Night Monarch. I think it appeared when you summoned those world spirits back to the World Spirit Space,” Yu Sha replied.

The Asura King and the others also approached the black gate after having sensed Chu Feng’s entry. Just like Yu Sha, their activity was restricted to their side of the black gate. They were unable to enter the space where Yu Sha and Eggy were residing in.

“Lord Chu Feng, what happened?” the Asura King asked.

“Elder Kui Ting, do you know what the picture above the gate represents?” Chu Feng asked.

The Asura King was once a follower of the Emperor of Massacre, so Chu Feng thought that he might know about it.

“Picture? What picture?” the Asura King answered in bewilderment.

Realizing something, Chu Feng quickly headed to the other side of the gate and confirmed that the picture was only visible from Chu Feng’s side. However, that didn’t pose a problem to him,

He quickly began drawing out a compressed version of the black gate together with the picture using his spirit power.

However, the Asura King and the Asura World Spirits shook their heads, indicating that they had never seen it before. Chu Feng wasn’t too surprised to see that since this gate was specially constructed by the Emperor of Massacre.

He spent a moment examining the picture but was unable to make sense of it, so he could only give up in the end.

Returning to the real world, Chu Feng bade everyone farewell. He told Shengguang Baimei and the others to wait for him at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm before taking a trip to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

He was planning to look for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land. His father had once told him that the forbidden contained a power that could aid him in awakening his bloodline.

He wasn’t ready for it back then, but he had grown a lot since. He had already reached peak Martial Exalted level, and it wouldn’t be long before he reached Half-God level.

So, he wanted to see if he could awaken his Heavenly Bloodline. He was in dire need of power, and this was one of the avenues where he could swiftly advance his strength.

He entered the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm through the Chu Heavenly Clan’s teleportation formation, where he found himself on the Heavenly Road leading to the Holy Land of Martialism.

Memories rushed back to him when he saw the Heavenly Road once more. He could still remember just how mysterious and powerful the Holy Land of Martialism was to him when he first entered the Heavenly Road.

But now, he could freely pass through any place in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm within moments, unhindered by any barrier or formation. That was how powerful he had become.

But that was only relative to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Against the entire world of cultivation, he was still extremely weak. That was why he needed to return to this land. He wanted to become strong, and the key to that lay inside the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land.

When he arrived at the forbidden land, he saw that the defensive formation constructed by his father was still there. Despite having become much stronger, the formation still felt as indestructible as it did back then.

Fortunately, this formation was designed to ward off strangers. Chu Feng was able to walk through it as if it didn’t exist at all.

Upon entering the forbidden land, Chu Feng suddenly remembered the first time he met Old Monkey and his father. That was the first real conversation he had with his father. It might have been a short one, but it was deeply etched in his mind.

He didn’t immerse himself in his memories and instead sat down with crossed legs. He knew that the energy that would aid him in awakening his bloodline lay in this forbidden land, so what he had to do now was to draw the energy out.

“This feeling…”

Chu Feng soon sensed some sort of energy hidden in this forbidden land. He tried to approach it, but it somehow filled his heart with trepidation. His dantian reacted so intensely that he thought that he was going to shatter into pieces.

That was a natural reaction to extreme danger. His senses were telling him that he would die if he continued on.

Chu Feng quickly stopped what he was doing, but that didn’t mean that he was giving up. Instead, he tried it a few more times.

Unfortunately, the results were the same.

He was certain that this land was filled with some kind of mysterious energy, but he couldn’t approach it at all, let alone discern what it was. Every time he tried to get close, it felt as if his soul was being torn apart.

“It looks like I’m not ready to awaken my bloodline yet,” Chu Feng said.

There was a smile on his face as he was able to verify his father’s words. As long as he continued working hard, it was only a matter of time before he could reap the rewards here.

Knowing that he wasn’t ready yet, he left the forbidden land. Instead of returning to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm right away, he decided to pay a visit to his family and friends.

Oblivious to him, shortly after he left, another silhouette appeared on the Heavenly Road. It was none other than Lord Bai.

His appearance was the same as before, but his disposition was completely different. If he felt like an ordinary civilian before, the airs he gave off were now more reminiscent of an enlightened daoist. That impression was further accentuated by the world spiritist robe he wore.

The world spiritist robe was glimmering ever so slightly, pulsating with the energy of a powerful formation.

Lord Bai didn’t make a move right away. Instead, he waited for Chu Feng to leave before turning his eyes in the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land.

“The Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land is much more formidable than I thought. I heard that the Ancestral Martial Realm is the realm with the highest concentration of natural energies, but it has gotten so thin that even its landmass has severely contracted, resulting in its deterioration into a Lower Realm.

“I thought that the natural energies of the Ancestral Martial Realm had naturally disappeared after the Ancient Era, but it turns out that it was just monopolized by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land. Now I am really curious to know just what is hiding in there. Just what in the world could possibly be absorbing the concentrated natural energies of the entire Ancestral Martial Realm?” Lord Bai murmured.

He was hesitant to proceed despite his curiosity, but he soon made up his mind.

“Chu Feng, please don’t blame me for this. I’m simply too curious as to what is hidden in your Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden land.”

Lord Bai activated a powerful observation formation, causing his eyes to glow brightly. He was trying to find a weakness in the protective formation Chu Xuanyuan had set up around the forbidden land.

Tzlala!

A crackle suddenly echoed from the protective formation. Following that, countless streaks of lightning suddenly bolted toward Lord Bai like a stampede of terrifying beasts.

“Surely not! Just a glance is enough to trigger the protective formation?”

Lord Bai was alarmed. He immediately waved his sleeves and manifested a formation barrier that towered tens of thousands of meters.

Boom!

There was a loud explosion, and the formation barrier was instantaneously reduced to ashes.

“Damn it!”

Lord Bai quickly made his retreat, but the bolts of lightning moved even faster than him. Seeing that it was impossible for him to escape in time, Lord Bai quickly whipped out a teleportation talisman and crushed it.

The power of teleportation quickly shrouded Lord Bai and took him away in the blink of an eye.

The bolts of lightning halted their pursuit as soon as Lord Bai disappeared and returned to the protective formation as if nothing had happened at all.

…

A teleportation formation gate suddenly manifested above the towering waves of the Eastern Sea, and a silhouette staggered out from it in a fluster. It was Lord Bai.

“Who left the formation there? I would have never thought that there would be such a frightening cultivator in the present era.”

Lord Bai glanced back in the direction where he came from with a frightful look on his face. He knew that it would have been hard for him to escape death if those lightning bolts had struck him.
