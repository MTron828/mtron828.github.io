Chapter 2963 - Provocation And Insults

“Little brother Chu Feng, you’ve awoken?”

“Little brother Chu Feng, you’re alright now?”

“Little brother Chu Feng, I am truly relieved to see you fine. Did you know how worried for you I was these days when you were unconscious?”

Suddenly, a group of people rushed out of the crowd. Not only did they completely surround Chu Feng and Chu Yue, but they even revealed expressions of deep concern. It was as if they were Chu Feng’s relatives that had known him for many years as they began to ask Chu Feng about his health worriedly.

At that moment, Chu Feng frowned. He thought to himself, ‘the younger generation of the Chu Heavenly Clan are actually only like this too.’

Back then, those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations would refuse to even give a fuck about Chu Feng. Yet at present, they were acting so eagerly attentive.

Their reaction was not because of any familial love. Instead, it was because they’d seen Chu Feng’s potential.

Right at that moment, a cold voice sounded loudly, “Since when did that exiled trash become your little brother?”

The people that had surrounded Chu Feng and were acting deeply concerned for him were immediately stunned.

At that moment, Chu Feng saw a word on their faces - hesitation.

They were only hesitant for a single moment before immediately dispersing.

They had made their decision. They had made the choice between Chu Feng and the person that had shouted earlier.

As for the person that had shouted those words earlier, it was that man by the name of Chu Haoyan.

At that moment, Chu Haoyan was slowly walking toward Chu Feng.

At that moment, everyone had closed their mouths. Anyone could tell that this Chu Haoyan was planning to stir up trouble for Chu Feng.

However, who would’ve thought that Chu Haoyan did not immediately try to make things difficult for Chu Feng upon arriving before him. Instead, he looked to Chu Yue who stood beside Chu Feng. Using a threatening tone, he said, “Chu Yue, don’t you want to continue to survive in the Chu Heavenly Clan?”

Chu Feng noticed that Chu Yue’s face immediately turned pale with fear after Chu Haoyan said those words to her. In fact, she was unable to even speak properly.

It could be seen that Chu Yue was extremely afraid of that Chu Haoyan.

Seeing the expression of fear on Chu Yue’s face, Chu Haoyan did not feel any protective feelings for the fairer sex. Instead, he grew even more furious, and asked with an even more stern tone, “I am asking you a question!!!”

Once Chu Haoyan said those words, Chu Yue was so scared that she immediately moved back and nearly fell to the ground.

It was Chu Feng who promptly extended his arm to catch Chu Yue and help her back up.

At that moment, Chu Feng brought Chu Yue behind him. He faced Chu Haoyan head-on and said, “If you don’t like me, say it to me straightforwardly. To target a young woman, what sort of man are you?”

“Yoh, you’re quite a man yourself. Is this a hero saving a beauty? Aiyoyo, truly amazing and deserving of praise!” Chu Haoyan started to mock and ridicule Chu Feng with a smile on his face.

Then, an ominous glint suddenly appeared in his eyes. He said to Chu Feng, “Did you really think that you were qualified to speak against this young master just because you’ve ascended to the Heavenly Lightning Steps’ ninth step?”

“You weren’t present that day, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“What are you trying to say?” Chu Haoyan was confused.

“What I’ve reached was not the Heavenly Lightning Steps’ ninth step. Instead, it was the tenth step,” Chu Feng corrected.

“I don’t give a fuck what step you reached. What’s this? Did you think yourself to be very amazing?”

Right at that moment, Chu Haoyan actually grabbed Chu Feng’s lapel.

At the moment when Chu Haoyan grabbed Chu Feng’s lapel, Chu Feng started to frown. He could feel a killing intent sweeping toward him.

“Chu Feng,” right at that moment, a hand grabbed Chu Feng’s wrist.

It was Chu Yue. Chu Yue not only grabbed Chu Feng, she was also sending a voice transmission to him.

“Chu Feng, do not provoke this Chu Haoyan. His grandfather is a Chu Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder. Apart from Chu Ruoshi, Chu Lingxi and Chu Huanyu, there is simply no one among the younger generations that would dare offend him.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s anger was forcibly suppressed.

It was not that Chu Feng was afraid of Chu Haoyan, nor was it that he was afraid of Chu Haoyan’s background.

Instead, Chu Feng was worried about Chu Yue.

Chu Feng had no plans of staying in the Chu Heavenly Clan for an extended period of time. He would one day end up leaving.

Regardless of whether he stayed or left he would not be afraid of Chu Haoyan.

However, it would be different for Chu Yue. If Chu Feng were to leave, what would happen to her?

With that Chu Haoyan’s temperament, he would definitely retaliate against Chu Yue.

Even though it was Chu Feng’s first time meeting Chu Yue, Chu Feng had already started to have a feeling of familial affection for her.

It might be because of Chu Yue’s name, or it might be because she had taken care of him when he was unconscious. However, Chu Feng truly felt that Chu Yue was a very close and dear person to him. He truly considered her to be his older sister. Thus, Chu Feng had to show consideration for her sake.

“What’s this? Your expression earlier was amiss. Could it be that you wanted to fight against me?”

Right at that moment, Chu Haoyan lifted Chu Feng by his lapel. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Chu Haoyan lifted Chu Feng, Chu Yue’s hand that was grabbing onto Chu Feng’s wrist grew tighter. Chu Feng was able to sense Chu Yue’s hand shivering. She was truly scared, she was extremely afraid of Chu Haoyan.

It was because of Chu Yue that Chu Feng forcibly suppressed his surging anger.

“What’s this? Where’s the expression you showed earlier?”

“Weren’t you rumored to be extremely amazing, fearless and daring to offend anyone?”

“It turns out you’re nothing more than a paper tiger,” Chu Haoyao mocked.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, rumbles sounded from deep within the palace hall as a gate opened.

At that moment, the crowd’s eyes all shifted. The reason for that was because the opening of the gate meant that the Sacred Domain Selection had begun.

“Chu Haoyan, your cultivation is above Chu Feng’s. You are clearly stronger than him. Even if you are to fight against him and win, you would only have won through an unfair advantage.”

Right at that moment, a voice was heard. It was Chu Ruoshi.

“Chu Ruoshi, it would appear that you have quite a relationship with this Chu Feng. You’re actually speaking for him now?” Chu Haoyan said eccentrically.

“If I possessed a relationship with Chu Feng, I would definitely not only be speaking right now. Instead, you would already be lying on the ground,” Chu Ruoshi said.

“You!!!” Hearing those words, Chu Haoyan immediately revealed a furious look.

Oh how mocking were those words.

They were both people of the younger generation, both outstanding geniuses of the Chu Heavenly Clan, but Chu Ruoshi did not place Chu Haoyan in her eyes in the slightest.
