MGA: Chapter 1843 - The True Remains

“Indeed, he’s a good sapling. This is the first time that I’ve seen a member of the younger generation as powerful as him.”

“But, why is he unconscious?” Duan Jidao asked.

“Lord Duan, Chu Feng did not wish to obtain your inheritance. It is I who brought him here by force,” Yin Gongfu said.

“There’s actually someone in this world who does not wish to obtain my inheritance?” Duan Jidao was shocked upon hearing that. Then, a stubborn expression appeared in his aged eyes. He looked to Chu Feng, smiled and said, “This child is truly arrogant. I shall see what abilities he possesses for him to dare to refuse even my inheritance.”

“Paa~~~”

After he finished saying those words, Duan Jidao placed his left palm onto Chu Feng’s dantian area. Then, he moved his right hand and took out countless amounts of ores from his Cosmos Sack. There were so many ores that they actually piled up into a small mountain. These were the same ores that Jiang Wushang and the others were mining.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, Duan Jidao extended his hand and grabbed. A piece of ore entered his hand. After the ore entered his hand, it rapidly melted away. Following that, his body started to radiate with light.

Seeing this scene, Yin Gongfu immediately revealed an ecstatic expression. He had truly never expected that Duan Jidao would forcibly pass his power on to Chu Feng. Duan Jidao was even more straightforward than he had anticipated.

“How could it be? His dantian...” Duan Jidao revealed an expression of shock.

“Milord, what’s wrong?” Yin Gongfu asked concernedly.

“It’s nothing. I refuse to believe that this won’t work,” Duan Jidao waved his sleeve. The mountainous pile of ore began to enter his hand nonstop. Piece by piece, they dissolved and turned into a special power that was forcibly instilled into Chu Feng’s dantian.

“Boom~~~~”

Suddenly, a muffled explosion was heard. That explosion originated from within Chu Feng’s body. After that muffled explosion was heard, Duan Jidao was forced back many steps repeatedly. It was only when he was a hundred meters away from Chu Feng that he managed to steady himself.

“Milord, what happened?” Seeing this, Yin Gongfu was deeply shocked. Being associated with Duan Jidao for so long, Yin Gongfu knew very well how powerful Duan Jidao was. Describing him with the word ‘unfathomable’ would be the most suitable.

However, at this moment, not only had Duan Jidao been forced a hundred meters away, his aged body was also violently trembling.

“I’m fine.”

Duan Jidao waved his hand. However, his breathing was very rapid. It was only after a long time that he finally managed to moderate his breathing. Then, he showed a complicated gaze, and began to examine Chu Feng carefully for a while. After that, he looked to Yin Gongfu and asked, “Do you know whose descendant Chu Feng is?”

“This junior does not know. Chu Feng’s origin seems to be a mystery,” Yin Gongfu said.

“Inconceivable, truly inconceivable. No wonder that child is so heaven-defying and possesses his strength at such a young age,” Duan Jidao exclaimed in admiration.

“Lord Duan, exactly what’s going on with Chu Feng?” Yin Gongfu was completely confused.

“There is simply no need for him to receive my inheritance. I am also unable to pass on Lord Emperor Huang’s power to him,” Duan Jidao said.

“Why is that?” Yin Gongfu started to panic. He had truly hoped that Duan Jidao would pass Emperor Huang’s power on to Chu Feng.

“Why is that?” Duan Jidao smiled and shook his head, “In his body is a power stronger than even Imperial Bloodlines. Likely, the altitude that he will reach in the future is something that would be impossible for even Lord Emperor Huang.”

“Milord, is what you said the truth?” Yin Gongfu felt this to be hard to believe.

“Naturally. I possess Lord Emperor Huang’s bloodline. However, should I compare my bloodline with this Chu Feng’s, it is simply incomparable,” Duan Jidao said.

“This...”

Hearing those words, Yin Gongfu was extremely shocked. When he looked to Chu Feng again, his expression became very complicated.

Suddenly, Yin Gongfu walked over to Chu Feng and placed his hand on Chu Feng’s forehead. A stream of energy was removed from Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s body trembled, and then he opened his eyes. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Chu Feng, although you were unconscious, you were only half unconscious. You should know what happened earlier.”

“Earlier, Lord Duan wanted to pass on his power to you. However, he was simply unable to do so. The reason for that was because you possess an Inherited Bloodline even stronger than his. Chu Feng, exactly who are you? What sort of bloodline do you have in your body? Could it really be as the rumors say, that your bloodline is a bloodline capable of bringing fear to Imperial Bloodlines?” After waking Chu Feng, Yin Gongfu asked him many questions in succession.

“Senior, it is true that I possess an Inherited Bloodline. As for my Inherited Bloodline being stronger than Imperial Bloodlines, that is also the truth, and not just a rumor. Otherwise, the Four Great Imperial Clans would not want me dead as badly as they do. The reason for that is because I am indeed a threat to them.”

“As for my identity, even I myself am uncertain. As I do not know who my parents are, I naturally also do not know exactly what my Inherited Bloodline is,” Chu Feng did not say the whole truth. He did not wish to tell Yin Gongfu and Duan Jidao that he was from the Outer World.

Duan Jidao had not successfully passed his power on to Chu Feng. If he had succeeded, then he would’ve been on Chu Feng’s side.

However, since he had failed, Chu Feng was not certain whether or not he was a friend or a foe.

“So that’s the case,” Yin Gongfu began to ponder. He felt extremely regretful that Chu Feng was unable to obtain Duan Jidao’s inheritance.

Chu Feng stood up, then spoke to Duan Jidao. “Senior Duan Jidao, thank you very much for thinking so highly of me. To be unable to obtain your inheritance is this Chu Feng’s loss.”

“However, disregarding the things concerning me, my brother, Jiang Wushang, was wrongly accused. I hope that senior Duan Jidao will be able to distinguish between right and wrong, and not have him receive unjust treatment and bear punishments that he should not have to.”

“Jiang Wushang is your brother?” Duan Jidao asked.

“Yes,” Chu Feng nodded.

“Little friend Chu Feng’s talent is exceptional. In the future, you will definitely become a very capable person. This old man wishes to become your friend in my later years. However, the World’s Hidden Valley possesses its own rules. As Wushang has violated the rules, he must receive punishment. As such, you do not have to plead for him anymore.”

“Gongfu, it’s quite late now. You can take little friend Chu Feng back. Remember, you must treat him as a distinguished guest. In the future, little friend Chu Feng is able to come and go through our World’s Hidden Valley as he wishes.”

“Oh, that’s right. Have the people of our World’s Hidden Valley keep their mouths tight. This matter of little friend Chu Feng being here is not allowed to be spread out. If anyone dares to spread that information, they will be killed,” Duan Jidao called to Yin Gongfu.

Chu Feng was no fool. He already understood Duan Jidao’s intentions. If Duan Jidao were to release Jiang Wushang, it would come as a disgrace to Song Yuheng. Between Jiang Wushang and Song Yuheng, Duan Jidao had already chosen Song Yuheng. Naturally, he would not release Jiang Wushang just because Chu Feng pleaded for him. Thus, Chu Feng did not try to plea for Jiang Wushang anymore.

Afterward, Chu Feng was brought back to his resting place by Yin Gongfu. However, at this moment, Chu Feng did not give up hope. Instead, he was rejoicing. He had seen an opportunity, an enormous opportunity.

“Eggy, did you see that?” Chu Feng asked Eggy.

“Are you talking about that gravestone?” Eggy asked.

“It’s naturally that gravestone that I’m talking about,” Chu Feng said.

“What do you think about it?” Eggy asked.

“Song Yuheng’s grandfather must’ve definitely done something to the remains. The remains that he presented are fake,” Chu Feng said.

“If that’s the case, then Song Yuheng’s grandfather already knew about Duan Jidao’s past before he even presented the remains. Else, it would impossible for it to be that coincidental,” Eggy said.

“Of course it wouldn’t be that coincidental. Song Yuheng’s grandfather should have known that Duan Jidao deeply disliked him robbing graves. Even if he robbed graves before, he would conceal his actions from Duan Jidao. However, that one time, he decided to present the remains that he had obtained from his grave robbing to Duan Jidao, even bearing the dangers of punishment. It is evident that he did so with a purpose.”

“The reason for that is because he knew that as long as he presented Duan Jidao with what he had obtained, not only would Duan Jidao not punish him, he would instead reward him. And in fact, he succeeded,” Chu Feng said.

“Unfortunately, he doesn’t know that you’ve seen the actual remains. Furthermore, you know where they’re located,” Eggy said.

“That’s right. It would seem that I will be able to help Wushang enormously,” Chu Feng said.

“When do you plan to set out?” Eggy asked.

“Tonight,” Chu Feng said.

It turned out that Chu Feng had seen Duan Jidao’s lover’s gravestone when he had woken up. Other than the name of Duan Jidao’s lover, Duan Qirou, there was also a poem on the gravestone.

I was born when you were not

I was old when you were born

You regret that I was late early

I regret that you were early late

I wished to have been born together

We could have enjoyed our time together

I was so far away from you

You were so distant from me

I’d have become a flower-seeking butterfly

And slept on the fragrant grass every night

[1. Deeply sorry, I misread the poem lol. Fixed it on chapter 1311. Basically the You and I are switched.]

That poem was the same poem that was on the gravestone beside the crystal coffin in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest.

Not only did Chu Feng discover that the poem on the gravestone was the same poem that was on the gravestone by Duan Jidao, he also discovered that there were two different types of handwriting on the gravestones. One was extremely firm and hard, whereas the other was gentle and soft.

This meant that the writings on them were by two different people. The firm and hard handwriting was most definitely written by Duan Jidao. He had personally written ‘Beloved Wife, Duan Qirou’ on the gravestone. As for the gentle and soft handwriting, it should be the handwriting of his beloved wife, Duan Qirou. Duan Jidao had deliberately imitated his lover’s handwriting to write that poem on the gravestone.

As for Duan Jidao’s imitation handwriting, it just so happened to be exactly the same as the handwriting on the gravestone in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest.

Furthermore, that sentimental poem precisely described the tragedy of a pair of lovers who were unable to be together due to their age difference. This was also very similar to the story of Duan Jidao and Duan Qirou.

Thus, Chu Feng was certain that the mysterious woman in the crystal coffin in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest was the real Duan Qirou.

As for the so-called remains that Song Yuheng’s grandfather had presented to Duan Jidao, regardless of what sort of method he had used to fool Duan Jidao’s eyes, they were fake.
