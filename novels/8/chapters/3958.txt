Chapter 3958 - How Could We Allow You To Escape?

The Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciples outside began to violently beat up their fellow disciple by the name of Song Xiao.

In fact, their conduct could even be said to be somewhat cruel. It was no longer capable of being described as a violent beating.

They were torturing that Song Xiao.

As they tortured him, they even began insulting and humiliating him.

“Song Xiao, you are truly one that’s incapable of differentiating good from bad. Did you really think that trash like you would capable of fighting over junior sister Bai with senior brother Wang?”

“Whether it be senior brother Wang’s background or his talent for martial cultivation, which one could you possibly compare to?”

“Perhaps you still don’t know this, but senior brother Wang was selected as one of our Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciples tasked with retrieving the treasure.”

“You should know that there’s only a total of a hundred people qualified to receive that task.”

“Furthermore, junior sister Bai is also one of them.”

“Think about it. With how excellent junior sister Bai is, only someone like senior brother Wang would be able to match her. As for you, did you really think that someone like you could match her?”

That Song Xiao was already screaming miserably after being tortured by the other six. His body had become very weak.

However, throughout the entire ordeal, he did not utter a single word of apology.

When he heard that Wang Chen was tasked to represent the Wind Lightning Sword Sect to enter the contest for the treasure with their junior sister Bai, a cold sneer appeared on his face. He said, “The reason why others are able to represent our Wind Lightning Sword Sect is because of their strength. However, Wang Chen is only able to represent our Wind Lightning Sword Sect because of his connections.”

“Besides, what use is there in him entering? With his bits of cultivation, what makes you think he’s qualified to compete against those Exalted-level geniuses?”

“He’s simply entering to make up the numbers. To be trash that’s unable to do anything, what is there to be proud of?”

Once Song Xiao said those words, the disciples that were torturing him were all stunned with fear.

Then, they all turned their gazes to the disciple by the name of Wang Chen.

Sure enough, it was as they expected. That Wang Chen’s face had turned terrifyingly gloomy.

“Song Xiao, you are truly one that refuses the face that is given to you.”

“You said that I’m only there to make up the numbers? If that’s the case, then what would you, someone who’s inferior to even me, be?”

“The way I see it, someone like you is simply unqualified to be a disciple of our Wind Lightning Sword Sect. You are simply not qualified to even exist in this world. You are someone who should disappear.”

“Zzzzz~~~”

As that Wang Chen spoke, he extended his palm. Lightning appeared on his palm, which gathered together and formed a sword in his hand.

Seeing that, the disciples that were torturing Song Xiao earlier became even more terrified.

They were surprised to discover that Wang Chen was not only using a martial skill unfamiliar to them, but most importantly, Wang Chen was emitting intense killing intent.

Wang Chen was planning to kill Song Xiao.

“Senior brother Wang Chen, it’s enough to just teach him a lesson.”

“It wouldn’t be good to really kill him.”

“No matter what, he’s an actual disciple. If he disappears like this, I’m afraid our elders will investigate things.”

At that moment, the other disciples started to panic. They were actually trying to dissuade Wang Chen.

It would appear that they’d only been trying to help Wang Chen teach that Song Xiao a lesson, and did not really intend to kill him.

“Rest assured. We are in the All-heaven Upper Realm, the territory of the All-heaven Sect. Besides, there are multiple different powers gathered here right now.”

“If a mere Song Xiao is to disappear, our sect will not look into it too much. Even if they are to investigate, they will not suspect us. Instead, they will suspect the other powers.”

“Furthermore, Song Xiao has no backing whatsoever. Our sect would not make a big fuss over the disappearance of someone like him.”

Wang Chen’s expression remained gloomy. At the same time, he was very calm and unflustered. Compared to the other disciples, he was someone who did not care about the death of Song Xiao at all.

“If you say it like that, it does make sense.”

After hearing what Wang Chen said, the disciples that were originally flustered all nodded, and stopped being so flustered.

In fact, they began to look at Song Xiao with slightly mocking gazes. They wanted to see whether or not he would still be unyielding before actual death.

“People will all die at some point. The only thing that I, Song Xiao, am unreconciled with is that I will die at the hands of a bunch of despicable vile characters like you.”

“But, if the heavens wills it, then I, Song Xiao, can only accept my fate.”

“Come on, incompetent scoundrels. If you want to kill me, go ahead and do so. If I, Song Xiao, am to blink in fear, then I will no longer be surnamed Song.”

However, even though he was faced with death, Song Xiao showed no fear at all.

“Enough with pretending to be some sort of iron-blooded heroic man before me.”

“In the world of martial cultivators, the victors are kings, and the losers are thieves. You, Song Xiao, are nothing more than a corpse by my blade. When it is I, Wang Chen, that kills you, what is there for you to be proud of?”

“Useless trash, prepare to die.”

Wang Chen did not exercise restraint after seeing Song Xiao’s courageous spirit. Instead, he grew more furious, and his killing intent even stronger. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Zzzzz~~~”

The lightning sword streaked across the sky. Even space itself was severed by it.

Its might was self-evident. That sword was most definitely capable of beheading Song Xiao, bringing him certain death.

However, all of a sudden, the lightning sword disappeared into thin air.

“What happened?”

“This is?”

The crowd all turned their gazes to Wang Chen.

They thought that Wang Chen had suddenly decided to be lenient to Song Xiao, and held back on killing him.

However, the reality was that even Wang Chen himself was completely confused.

He also didn’t know why his lightning sword made of martial power would disappear all of a sudden.

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

At the moment when the crowd were confused, a series of claps could be heard.

Looking toward the sounds of applause, they saw that Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were standing nearby, and walking towards them.

Upon seeing Chu Feng and the others, the expressions of Wang Chen’s group of six changed enormously.

This was especially true for Wang Chen. He had already realized that his earlier martial skill had been forcibly cancelled out by someone.

This made him realize that the strangers that had appeared before him were much more powerful than him. Otherwise, they couldn’t possibly be able to erase his attack without him or anyone else noticing it at all.

Chu Feng looked to the disciples of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and spoke mockingly, “For the sake of a woman, you are willing to kill a fellow disciple who you have no hatred or grievance with.”

“A bunch of accomplices incapable of distinguishing right and wrong, giving succor to the evildoer.”

“The disciples of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect have truly broadened my horizons.”

“Who are you?” asked Wang Chen with a stern voice. Although his voice sounded firm, it was actually trembling. That trembling had revealed the fear he was feeling.

“Passers-by,” said Chu Feng.

“Since you’re passers-by, I’d urge you all to not meddle in other people’s business.”

“Our Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s Sectmaster is currently in the All-heaven Upper Realm, in the All-heaven Sect. If you all are to offend us, not even the All-heaven Sect will be able to protect you.”

Wang Chen spoke with a strong-willed voice. It would not be wrong to describe his behavior as arrogant.

However, right after he finished saying those words, he turned around, grabbed Song Xiao, and intended to soar into the sky.

He... actually wanted to flee.

Sure enough, he was afraid. Even though his voice remained very strong-willed, his heart was actually completely flustered.

He did not dare to linger too long, and wanted to escape.

However, how could Chu Feng possibly allow them to escape?
