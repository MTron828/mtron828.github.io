MGA: Chapter 1064 - Arriving at the Immortal Pond

“Gap? With merely a Royal Armament, you actually dared to try to talk about gaps with me? Brat, you are truly too arrogant!”

Even though he sensed how powerful the Demon Sealing Sword was, Han Tao refused to acknowledge Chu Feng’s might. Thus, with disregard to the consequences, he moved his body, held the large Royal Armament axe in his hand, and smashed it at Chu Feng.

“Woosh.” Seeing this, Chu Feng also moved his body. Holding the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand, he began to fight Han Tao.

“Clank. Clunk. Clunk.”

Their speed was extremely fast. The others were nearly unable to see their movements. They merely heard the sound of metals colliding before a large number of sparks appeared in midair. Only after that did they see the two figures appearing in the air once again. The figures then landed onto the ground.

“Wuuuaaahh~~~”

At the moment when the two landed on the ground, the crowd was stupefied once again. That was because Han Tao was lying on the ground. On top of that, a pitch-black colored sword was pierced into his body. It was precisely the Demon Sealing Sword.

A single bout. It was merely a single bout. After the two of them took out their Royal Armaments, a single bout was all it took for the outcome of the battle to be decided.

Moreover, this outcome was something that people from the Han family did not anticipate, something that they did not imagine would happen. Even though their Han family’s elders had mentioned about how powerful Chu Feng was to them, it was something that they did not believe.

And now, they had finally believed it. Merely, it appeared to be already too late. That was because, at this moment, the location where Chu Feng’s Demon Sealing Sword was pierced into Han Tao’s dantian.

With his dantian pierced, his cultivation was spilling out from it. Han Tao, a rank three Martial King, was having his cultivation crippled by Chu Feng. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Wuuwaaa~~~” Suddenly, Chu Feng moved the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand. This caused Han Tao to give off another scream. But, Chu Feng ignored Han Tao’s reaction and sneered. “This is the gap between you and I.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng suddenly waved the Demon Sealing Sword. “Bang.” Han Tao’s body exploded and turned into a large mist of blood that sprinkled everywhere.

At the time when the mist of blood appeared, another layer of invisible energy burst forth from Chu Feng’s body. It covered that mist of blood and absorbed it into Chu Feng’s body.

Chu Feng had not only killed Han Tao, he had even absorbed him together with his source energy. It could be said that he had completely killed Han Tao.

After killing Han Tao, Chu Feng carried his Demon Sealing Sword over his shoulder and began to proceed toward the eight other people from the Han family. Seeing their frightened expressions and trembling bodies, Chu Feng lightly laughed and said, “Remember, in your next life, you must listen to your elders. Otherwise, you might lose your lives again.”

After he finished saying those words, the Demon Sealing Sword in Chu Feng’s hand was waved around once more. A pitch-black colored crescent wave swept past. Those eight bodies that were originally standing all exploded in succession and turned into eight scarlet mists of blood.

However, like what had happened to Han Tao, before the mists of blood could even fall to the ground, Chu Feng had already absorbed them completely. The reason why Chu Feng did this was not only to absorb their origin energies, the more important thing was to not leave behind any traces of their bodies.

After all, the Ancient Era’s Elves had clearly prohibited wanton battles in this place and even more greatly prohibited the killing of others. Thus, Chu Feng must kill them without leaving a single hint. Otherwise, he would bring about a calamity upon himself.

After killing all of the people from the Han family, Chu Feng did not plan to stop. Instead, he turned his tranquil yet ice-cold gaze at the disciples of the Black Python Stronghold.

“Brother, spare us, brother, please spare us.”

“It is us who have eyes but failed to see. It is us who have eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. Please spare our lives. We would definitely keep our lips tight to the matters that happened today. We would definitely keep it all a secret for you.” At this moment, the people from the Black Python Stronghold were all trembling. After that, with a ‘putt’ sound, they all kneeled to the ground and began to kowtow to Chu Feng and beg for his forgiveness.

“Heh.” Seeing these disciples of the Black Python Stronghold that were weeping bitter tears, Chu Feng coldly laughed and then said, “The reason why I feigned to be deeply afraid earlier was precisely to probe the reason why you all have come here.”

“If you all had planned to merely teach me a lesson, I would’ve let matters be. Earlier however, we have clearly sensed killing intent from you all.”

“The reason you all have come here is precisely to take my life. Yet now you want me to spare your lives, do you not find this to be extremely funny?”

After hearing those words, the people from the Black Python Stronghold all displayed extremely dejected expressions. They finally realized the reason why Chu Feng pretended to be so cowardly earlier even though he was this powerful. At the same time, they also realized that they would likely meet their ends at Chu Feng’s hands today.

“Nothing to say? Well, then it’s about time for me to send you all off.” Suddenly, the Demon Sealing Sword in Chu Feng’s hand was waved. With merely a single sword strike, the lives of all these disciples from the Black Python Stronghold were lost.

After killing these people from the Black Python Stronghold, Chu Feng placed his Demon Sealing Sword away. He then removed the Thunder Armor, returning his cultivation from rank one Martial King to rank nine Martial Lord.

After doing these, Chu Feng inspected through his spirit formation of the outside surroundings. After discovering that there was no one around, he waved his large sleeve and dispelled his concealing spirit formation.

“Let’s go.” After dispelling the concealing spirit formation, Chu Feng said to the others these words before moving toward the depths of the forest.

“Gulp.” At this moment, Wang Wei and the others who were looking at Chu Feng’s back were unable to help themselves from gulping down a mouthful of saliva.

Even though there were people among them that had killed before, some had even killed more than once or twice, there was not a single one among them who could kill others without blinking an eye. As if it was a common occurrence, Chu Feng did not have any reaction to it afterwards.

At this moment, Wang Wei and the others suddenly felt that Chu Feng had already killed an innumerable number of people. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to reach such a degree of indifference in killing.

Thinking till this point, the hearts of Wang Wei and the others began to boil. Their reverence towards Chu Feng was increased yet again. They suddenly felt that the distance between them and Chu Feng became even greater. That was because they had seen the true gap between them and Chu Feng. Compared to him, they were too weak in every aspect.

After this episode, Chu Feng and the others continued onward. After roughly four hours of walking, they finally exited the forest. What appeared before them was a vast and boundless area of water.

That area of water was truly beautiful. The water was extremely calm, it was like looking at a mirror. Moreover, the water was actually multi-colored.

Under the illumination of the sun, it was extremely gorgeous. It was simply like the rainbow had turned into a sea, like one had come to the land of immortals. Moreover, at such a close distance, the people were able to faintly see that at the deepest region of this region of water was an enormous pillar. That pillar was white in color. It extended out from the region of water all the way up to the sky into the boundless white mist.

Without even thinking, people knew right away that this region of water must be the legendary Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. As for that enormous pillar, it ought to be the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.

“This is the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond? Never would I imagine it to be this enormous. It could simply be compared to a small sea.” Seeing the vast Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, Wang Wei and the others were unable to help themselves from crying out in surprise. They were all fascinated by the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.

“Let’s go. Let’s check out this Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.” Compared to the others, Chu Feng merely took a slight appreciation of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond’s beauty. Afterwards, he began to proceed toward it.

If it was said that the purpose of Wang Wei and the others in coming here was merely for the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.

Then, the purpose that Chu Feng now had in coming to here included the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle in the deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.
