Chapter 5943: Obedient And Not Scheming At All

“My strength takes time to recover. Are you sure you want to waste it on that lass? This is a precious escape means for you,” Divine Deer asked.

“Elder, Little Fishy is an important friend. It’s not a waste to use it on her.” Chu Feng had already thought things through. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He knew that the Netherworld Sect would have made thorough preparations for Little Fishy’s capture, and he indeed didn’t have the means to save her now. Divine Deer was his best shot at saving her.

“I’ll help you since you have made up your mind. However, I advise you to first head there and assess the situation. It’ll be best for you to save her with your means. It’s not too late for me to make a move if things don’t work out,” Divine Deer said.

“All right.” Chu Feng continued rushing ahead, but a question soon surfaced in his mind, “Elder, there’s another question I’d like to ask, and I hope you won’t be angered by it.”

“Why are you asking if you know I’ll get angry? Hmph, Cut the crap and get to the point! I wonder how you managed to charm so many women. Are they drawn to your hot-bloodedness and selflessness?” Divine Deer scoffed.

“Sincerity is the key,” Chu Feng replied.

“...” Divine Deer was speechless.

“Haha, I’m kidding. We’re friends, not lovers,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

“Get to the point,” Divine Deer grunted impatiently.

“Elder, what are our chances of saving Little Fishy if you make a move?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am certain that I can pull it off in a place like this,” Divine Deer replied.

“That’s good.” Chu Feng breathed a sigh of relief.

He had witnessed the Divine Deer’s powers before, but that was when he was weak and his enemies weren’t strong. The threats he was dealing with now were of a different caliber, and it didn’t help that the Netherworld Sect was an enigmatic existence.

Chu Feng couldn’t be certain whether the Divine Deer was capable of dealing with an opponent like the Netherworld Sect.

Having a map on hand saved Chu Feng plenty of time. He rushed all the way out of fear that something might happen to Little Fishy in the meantime, so it didn’t take long for him to arrive at the place Song Yun pointed out to him.

Before he could assess his surroundings, he could already tell that this place was special.

The Netherworld Sect had deployed their most powerful detection formation here. Chu Feng dared not to advance any deeper, knowing that he would be discovered.

“The Netherworld Sect has such a powerful formation? Song Yun is right. They are indeed trickly opponents to deal with.”

Chu Feng had only encountered such ingenious formations in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion before. He didn’t expect an unorthodox power like the Netherworld Sect to have such powerful means.

“Elder, I’ll need your help,” Chu Feng said.

“Show me the map,” Divine Deer replied.

Chu Feng opened the map.

“Stow it away. Prepare yourself.”

A burst of light shone from Chu Feng’s body—it was the Divine Deer’s means. She manifested right beneath Chu Feng.

Without any warning, she suddenly whizzed ahead with Chu Feng on her back at a fast speed. Even though Chu Feng had made huge advancements in his cultivation, he was nowhere near reaching the Divine Deer’s speed.

She was much faster than the other experts he had met before.

Moving at a speed beyond one’s capability would usually result in the surroundings becoming blurred and hard to see, but thanks to the Divine Deer’s abilities, Chu Feng could perceive his surroundings.

As the Divine Deer dove underground, Chu Feng saw that there were many experts of the Netherworld Sect gathered here. Embroidered on their red robes were no longer the words ‘Netherworld Envoy’ but ‘Netherworld General’.

There were also many slaughter formations, sealing formations, and other means intended to deal with intruders. All of them were channeled via invaluable treasures from the Ancient Era. The security was so airtight that Chu Feng would have never been able to slip into here to save Little Fishy if not for the Divine Deer.

One of the Divine Deer’s most terrifying abilities was ignoring physical barriers and formations. She could slip through even the strongest formations. With a clear destination in mind, she could make a beeline for where Little Fishy was imprisoned.

After passing through yet another wall reinforced by a powerful formation, Chu Feng finally stumbled upon a gorgeous lady lying on a soft bed. It was Little Fishy.

Chu Feng breathed a sigh of relief.

There were no other formations here; it was just a prison for Little Fishy. Little Fishy was unconscious, but fortunately, she was unharmed, presumably because the Netherworld Sect hadn’t completed their preparations.

Chu Feng quickly grabbed the sleeping Little Fishy, and the Divine Deer activated her powers to whiz out of this place.

Shortly after they escaped from this place, the Divine Deer’s powers dissipated.

“Chu Feng, I have consumed all my energy. You’re on your own now,” Divine Deer said.

“I’ve troubled you, elder. I can deal with the rest.”

Chu Feng looked at Little Fishy and noticed that she wasn’t in a normal condition. Thus, he first constructed a formation and placed her in it before rushing off with the formation.

This realm had been sealed off by the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, so he would have to use the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s teleportation formation if he wanted to leave this place.

The problem was that the entry point of the teleportation formation was fixed. He had to head to the place where he came from to access the teleportation formation.

...

After bidding Chu Feng farewell, Song Yun made her way to an underground chamber filled with Netherworld Sectmembers.

None of these sectmembers were wearing the white bamboo hat, revealing their faces. There were not only just Netherworld Envoys but Netherworld Generals too, but even the Netherworld Generals would respectfully greet Song Yun with a “Miss Song Yun”.

Song Yun replied to each of them with an amicable attitude, including the Netherworld Envoys.

“Miss Song Yun is so gentle! She’s the true treasure of our Netherworld Sect. I heard that young master Chen Hui proposed to Miss Song Yun but was rejected.”

“I wonder who will be so lucky as to marry her. That person must have accrued hundreds of reincarnations worth of luck!”

The younger Netherworld Envoys gossipped with yearning eyes.

Song Yun headed straight for a room—it was her exclusive room. She was planning to use the treasure she had just obtained.

Before she could enter the room, a voice echoed behind her, “Miss Song Yun.”

Song Yun turned around and saw a middle-aged man.

On the latter’s robe were the words ‘Netherworld General’, but there were two tiers of Netherworld Generals in the Netherworld Sect—Ghost-tier and Demon-tier. This middle-aged man was a Demon-tier Netherworld General.

“Lord Netherworld General, do you need me for something?” Song Yun asked.

“Miss Song Yun, Lord Nine Demons wishes to meet you,” the Demon-tier Netherworld General said before leading the way.

Song Yun obediently followed him. She was brought to a massive hall.

The massive hall was empty, except for an old man seated deep inside. He had a brawny physique and a unique appearance as if he was born with defects. His eyebrows and hair were black on one side and white on the other, and his eyes looked more like a ferocious beast’s than a human’s. Most wouldn’t dare to look him in the eye.

“Lord Nine Demons, when did you arrive?” Song Yun quickly bowed.

Her etiquette was not in place, and she had a merry smile reminiscent of a junior meeting a close elder. The greeting was just a formality; she was overjoyed to meet him.

“Yun’er, I came here to thank you. We might not have been able to lure Xianhai Yu’er out if not for you disguising as Chu Feng,” Lord Nine Demons said.

“Lord Nine Demons, you’re flattering me. It’s just little wits and good luck. I am around the same age as Xianhai Yu’er, so I can better grasp her feelings,” Song Yun replied with an obedient and sweet smile that seemed devoid of schemes.
