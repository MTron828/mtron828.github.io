Chapter 5617: Eggy’s Idea

The gray-robed old man finally understood that he had been dancing on Chu Feng’s palm all this time. Chu Feng had escaped from his line of sight to construct a formation clone of himself before using it to lure him into the slaughter formation.

It was likely that Chu Feng had left his aura behind on purpose so that the gray-robed old man could follow him.

What the gray-robed old man couldn’t understand was how he could have failed to notice Chu Feng when he had passed by the latter earlier. As a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, his senses should have been sharp enough to notice Chu Feng.

While the gray-robed old man was in confusion, the slaughter formation churned into action.

Boom!

A brilliant light suddenly engulfed the mountain. Chu Feng, despite being outside the formation, could sense the terrifying energy ravaging the formation. This energy should have obliterated the gray-robed old man with ease, but a powerful spirit power seeped out from his body and protected him.

“What’s wrong, Number Seven?” Chu Feng heard another voice coming from the slaughter formation.

It wasn’t the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Two but another member.

“That fellow is too cunning. He lured me into a slaughter formation!” the gray-robed old man exclaimed.

From their conversation, Chu Feng confirmed that the gray-robed old man was indeed the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven.

“Stop talking and activate big brother’s protective token to channel the protective formation,” the other voice in the slaughter formation said.

Soon, the energy in the slaughter formation died down.

“Be careful, Chu Feng. He’s probably alive,” Eggy said.

“I know, but he won’t be alive for long.”

Chu Feng figured that the gray-robed old man’s protective formation should have reached its limit by now. As long as the other party continued to chase him, he would be able to lure him into another slaughter formation.

By then, the gray-robed old man would be dead meat.

Shoosh!

A flash of light shone from the slaughter formation and quickly enveloped the land. By the time the light faded, the boundaries of the area it had covered had already turned into a barrier.

It was an extremely strong barrier, and Chu Feng was trapped in it.

“Damn it!”

Realizing that he had been caught, Chu Feng quickly constructed a concealment formation and activated Divine Concealment.

“Brat! How dare you scheme against me?” the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven roared as he stepped out of the slaughter formation practically naked.

His gray robe had been ruined by the slaughter formation, and the only thing he had left was a Cosmos Sack floating alongside him. Despite having lost his gray robe, it was still impossible to make out his appearance as he was covered in blood from head to toe.

While he had survived the ordeal thanks to his protective formation, he still ended up sustaining terrible wounds. However, that was also the reason his killing intent was stronger than ever.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng didn’t lose his nerves. He thought that the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven shouldn’t be able to find him with his current means.

Boom!

The Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven suddenly brandished his saber, and his attack was aimed straight at where Chu Feng was hiding!Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng escaped with Divine Flitting before hiding once more.

However, the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven quickly unleashed another attack that was aimed at where Chu Feng was hiding.

Once again, Chu Feng dodged the attack, but this time around, he noticed that the other party was holding onto a compass. The compass was tracking Chu Feng’s movements.

“I see. The compass is giving away my whereabouts.” Chu Feng finally understood why the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven was able to find him. “There must be an imprint on my body then. When was it left on me? Was it the doing of the disciple of the Immortal Slaughter’s Number Two?”

He quickly examined his body, but he was unable to find any imprints. Nevertheless, he was certain that an imprint must have been left on him, or else there was no way the compass could have accurately identified his whereabouts.

“It looks like the Immortal Slaughterer is not to be underestimated.”

While the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven wasn’t particularly strong, he had formidable treasures in his possession, be it the compass he was using to track Chu Feng or the barrier he had just activated to isolate this area.

It would appear that the Immortal Slaughter’s Number Seven earlier claim that Chu Feng was meat on a chopping board wasn’t just empty words. He was indeed confident of curbing Chu Feng, just that he was reluctant to use the barrier earlier, likely because it was a one-time-use treasure. That had allowed Chu Feng to lead him into a slaughter formation, nearly causing his death.

But after what he had been through, he would have to be a fool to still think that Chu Feng was an easy opponent to subdue. Not daring to get careless, he immediately activated the barrier to trap Chu Feng in place.

Someone of his cultivation level shouldn’t have had a treasure of this caliber. The fact that he had something like this in his possession meant that he had someone strong backing him, and that the Immortal Slaughterer was not a pushover.

While Chu Feng was deep in thought, the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven continued to follow the compass’ directions to attack Chu Feng. To make things worse, the barrier was slowly narrowing, reducing the space Chu Feng could escape to.

At this rate, it was only a matter of time before Chu Feng ran out of space to dodge his attacks.

“Chu Feng, are you able to break free of the barrier?” Eggy asked.

“I’ve already constructed a formation for that. Let me give it a try,” Chu Feng said as he tossed out a formation.

He had been trying to construct a formation to unravel the barrier while making his escape, but he wasn’t too optimistic about its effectiveness. His gut feeling told him that the barrier was far beyond his means to deal with at the moment.

Indeed, he was right. His formation failed to unravel the barrier.

“Elder, have you not recovered yet?” Chu Feng turned to the Divine Deer for help.

“Chu Feng, it’s not that I don’t want to help you but I have not fully recovered yet,” the Divine Deer replied, but this was not the answer Chu Feng wanted to hear.

“It’s fine, elder. I’m not so weak as to die in his hands. It’s just that I find it a huge waste to use it on him,” Chu Feng replied with a sigh.

He couldn’t possibly die here since he still had his father’s protective formation, but he thought that it would be a huge waste to squander such a powerful protective formation on a Half-God level cultivator. However, it looked like there was no way around it anymore.

Just then, Eggy suddenly spoke up, “Chu Feng, I have an idea.”
