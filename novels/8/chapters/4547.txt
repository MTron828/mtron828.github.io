Chapter 4547: We’re Here For Chu Feng

“Chu Feng, listen to me. You mustn’t clash against them directly!”

Sensing the fluctuations in Chu Feng’s emotions, Gu Mingyuan reached out to grab Chu Feng anxiously, hoping to stop him from doing anything reckless.

It was just that before her hands could reach Chu Feng, the latter had already disappeared from sight.

Peng—

With a loud explosion, shattered stone fragments and brick tiles flew all over the place.

In the blink of an eye, an entire half of the residence had been shattered. The culprit behind the destruction was not anyone else but Chu Feng.

With a speed reminiscent of a comet, he flew toward the sky and shattered the residence that stood in his path. He ascended all the way till he was finally standing before Lu Wantong and the others.

Out of the sheer fury burning in his heart, Chu Feng didn’t bother hiding his cultivation. As such, his rank six Utmost Exalted level aura had already engulfed this entire city, drawing the attention of everyone inside the city.

“What powerful aura! Who is it? It feels weirdly familiar...”

“Oh my god, isn’t he... the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Feng?”

“It really is Chu Feng!”

“Why would Chu Feng possess such a powerful aura?”

“His aura feels even stronger than that of Lu Wantong. Could it be that... he’s already at rank six Utmost Exalted level?”

A huge uproar broke out within the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.

They had no idea that Chu Feng was here, so the commotion alarmed them. After feeling the aura that Chu Feng had released, they felt a mixture of astonishment and relief.

It was true that there were quite a few ambitious clan members in the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan who hoped for Chu Lingxi to marry Lu Wantong so that Lu Wantong would pave the way forth for them, but the majority of them still empathized with Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi. They couldn’t bring themselves to sell out their own people for the sake of rising through the ranks.

It was just that they were all too weak. They didn’t have the strength to stand against Lu Wantong and change everything.

However, it was different now. Chu Feng was here, and he had the power to turn things around.

For this reason, the crowd from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan thought of Chu Feng as their savior, and they were more than delighted with it.

“Gu Yang, is he that Chu Feng you spoke of?”

Even Lu Wantong’s face turned grave after feeling the aura that Chu Feng was emanating.

To have reached rank six Utmost Exalted level at such a young age, it was apparent that Chu Feng was no ordinary individual.

With his cultivation, he could easily stand amongst the ranks of the strongest juniors in the Holy Light Clan.

“Yes, Milord. It’s him,” Gu Yang replied.

“What’s the background of this fellow? Is he a junior?” Lu Wantong asked.

“Milord, he’s just an ordinary brat from the Ancestral Martial Starfield. His only affiliation is the Chu Heavenly Clan. Despite his superior talents, he has no background to speak of.

“However, this man is known to be vicious and vindictive, and I reckon that he harbors lustful intention for Chu Lingxi. You mustn’t spare him, or else it could lead to a great deal of trouble in the future!

“His old enemies in the Ancestral Martial Starfield made the mistake of letting him escape with his life, and as soon as that man grew up and wielded the strength to exact vengeance, he didn’t hesitate to massacre all of them.”

Gu Yang knew what Lu Wantong was worried about, so he quickly whispered to the latter.

After hearing what Gu Yang had to say, Lu Wantong, who was still a little worried a moment ago, immediately calmed down, and a gleeful smile broke out on his face, revealing his disgusting yellowish black teeth. There was a vicious glint in his narrowed eyes.

“Brat, you think that you can butt into the business of others just because you have that bit of talent? I’ll show you what the consequences of sticking your ass where it doesn’t belong!” Lu Wantong sneered coldly.

Chu Feng’s talents and character were of no importance to him. All Lu Wantong needed to know was whether Chu Feng had any backing since he wasn’t planning on letting him live past today if that was the case.

In Lu Wantong’s view, no matter how powerful an individual might have been, it would be futile if he didn’t have any backing he could fall back on.

“Haha, you’ll show me the consequences? You?”

Chu Feng burst into laughter, ridiculing Lu Wantong’s threat.

“Hahahahaha!”

Lu Wantong also laughed alongside Chu Feng as well, as if mocking the naivety of the young man before him.

“Brat, as expected of someone who has walked out from the bottom of a trash pile. You’re really a frog in a well. Do you think that you can do as you please just because you have a bit of talent? Hah, I’ll let you know the power of having connections today!”

As Lu Wantong spoke, he waved his hands grandly, and several armies immediately appeared outside the city.

They were the armies from 19 different powers. They boasted such great numbers that they looked like ominous storm clouds congregating together from all directions.

“This is...”

Upon seeing such a massive line-up, the crowd from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, who had just felt a spark of hope of turning the situation around, suddenly paled in fear.

They recognized quite a few powers amidst the armies from the uniforms they wore, and they were all dominant powers ruling over Middle Starfields by themselves.

“I’m interested to see just who dares to challenge Master Lu’s authority today!”

The leaders of these powers stepped forth and voiced their support for Lu Wantong.

As they spoke, they unhesitatingly released their oppressive might toward Chu Feng.

The weakest amongst them all was at least at Utmost Exalted level, and the strongest went as high as pinnacle Utmost Exalted level.

“It’s all over. We’re goners now.”

“That traitor Gu Yang! How can he do this to Lingxi?”

Sensing the pinnacle Utmost Exalted level auras lingering the area too, the crowd from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan fell into despair.

On the other hand, the smile on Lu Wantong’s lips grew even more gleeful as he relished in the looks of despair around him. He turned his gaze back onto Chu Feng once more and said, “You’re nothing more than a rat from a trashy third-tier Starfield. Do you comprehend the disparity between us now? You want to oppose me, but do you even have the qualifications to do so?”

Faced with Lu Wantong’s taunts, Chu Feng was just about to speak when a furious bellow suddenly sounded from the sky above.

“Who is the one causing such a huge ruckus here?”

The voice was loud and forceful, sounding several times more jarring than the deafening rumble of thunder. It shook the air and quaked the earth, compelling countless cultivators who had gathered here to collapse to the ground in fright.

This was because the voice carried an unstoppable oppressive might as well, and it was a force that even the oppressive might from the 19 powers combined didn’t stand a chance again.

It was the oppressive might of a Martial Exalted level cultivator!

“Martial Exalted level? Why would a Martial Exalted level expert be drawn here?”

Putting aside the clan members of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, even Lu Wantong and his allies were shaken by the abrupt presence of a Martial Exalted level cultivator!

They were still able to put on the airs of a god before the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan and Chu Feng, but if the other party was a Martial Exalted level cultivator, they could only quickly tuck their tails between their legs and stand humbly.

Boom boom boom—

A loud rumbling sounded from the eastern horizon.

Following that, a massive warship tore through the layers of clouds and appeared before everyone’s sights. The imposing warship was one thing, but what that really brought fear to the hearts of the onlookers were the flags fluttering above the warship.

“Cloudsky Immortal Sect. It’s the rising power of the Holy Light Galaxy, Cloudsky Immortal Sect!”

“Even though it originates from a Middle Starfield, there are rumors that the Cloudsky Immortal Sect has several Martial Exalted level cultivators in their ranks. In terms of prowess, it’s comparable to behemoths like the Dragon Clan and Monstrous Herd Temple!”

“What are they doing here?”

The crowd was horrified by the presence of those from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect. Even Lu Wantong’s group was showing their unease at the current turn of events.

Compared to other Martial Exalted level cultivators, those from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect were even more so frightening.

While their history wasn’t as long as that of the other behemoths, their reputation had already spread far and wide across the Holy Light Clan as a force to behold.

Boom!

In the next instant, another resounding explosion sounded by the western horizon of the sky, and yet another army appeared before everyone’s eyes.

The expressions of the crowd turned from one of fear into one that was completely dazed. Their minds couldn’t keep up with the swift changes that were happening before their eyes.

“My gosh, is that the Dragon Clan? What are they doing here?”

And that wasn’t the end yet.

Two more armies appeared after that from the southern and northern horizon of the sky. They were the Yu Heavenly Clan and Monstrous Herd Temple respectively.

At this point in time, there was no one present who wasn’t perspiring buckets of cold sweat.

If the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was the strongest power amongst the Middle Starfields, the Dragon, Monstrous Herd Temple, and Yu Heavenly Clan were indubitably publicly acknowledged behemoths that were only second in terms of power to the Holy Light Clan.

“It’s all over. I never thought that Lu Wantong would actually have the power to bring the Dragon Clan, Monstrous Herd Temple, Cloudsky Immortal Sect, and Yu Heavenly Clan here!” Gu Mingyuan exclaimed in horror.

The others from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan also had ashen looks on their faces.

Even Chu Lingxi had a tight frown on her forehead as she began to fluster.

Unprecedented despair gripped them by their necks, choking the oxygen out of their lungs. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The four strongest behemoths of the Holy Light Galaxy aside from the Holy Light Clan were standing right before them at this very instant. How could they stand a chance against them?

“Paying respects to Milord.”

Lu Wantong and his allies all immediately descended to the ground and kneeled on the floor.

As it turned out, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s sectmaster, Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, and Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had all just walked out from their respective carriages.

The presence of such legendary figures left everyone’s hearts nearly thumping out of their chests. One must know that these four people could easily shake the Holy Light Galaxy at its core with just a single word!

No one amidst the crowd dared to even look at them in the eye. They feared that they would inadvertently displease them somehow and bring about a catastrophic disaster to their companions.

Meanwhile, the four leaders of the behemoths shot at one another before descending simultaneously. But to everyone’s surprise, they headed straight toward Chu Feng and took their stance behind him.

For a moment, no one knew what to make out of this abrupt and almost ludicrous situation.

The four leaders of the behemoths gazed down at the kneeling Lu Wantong before speaking up, “Young hero Chu Feng, are these the ants who tried to climb over your head?”

Those words crashed down like a tsunami on the hearts of everyone present, be it Lu Wantong, his allies, Gu Mingyuan, or the crowd from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. There were utterly shocked by this twist.

This was especially so for Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi. They glanced at one another in incredulity, not daring to believe that this was actually happening.

The four behemoths had actually come to back Chu Feng up!
