MGA: Chapter 1643 - Nangong Longjian

Right after that golden dragon fell to the ground, a total of three old men suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

These three old men all possessed snow white hair. Their hair was longer than even their bodies. As they stood in the air, their hair reached down below their ankles.

These three old men appeared to have lived for a long time. It was not only several thousand years. Likely, they had lived for several tens of thousands of years. The reason for that was because even though their hair was very silky, their bodies were extremely aged, extremely thin and weak. It was as if the three of them could be blown away by a light breeze.

However, the three of them were emitting exceptionally powerful auras that shook even the space around them.

Each and every one of them possessed stronger auras than Nangong Beidou. Evidently, the three of them were all stronger than Nangong Beidou. They were three rank four Martial Emperors.

“It’s the Utmost Exalted Elders. The Utmost Exalted Elders have come. Our Nangong Imperial Clan will be saved!”

“Are they the Utmost Exalted Elders? They’re actually still alive? The Utmost Exalted Elders are actually still alive! This is truly great!”

Upon seeing these three old men, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan burst into an uproar once again. However, as they became excited and overjoyed, they also started to kneel onto the ground and respectfully bow to the three old men in the sky.

In fact, when bowing to those three old men, many of the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were so emotional that they actually started crying.

This could not be blamed on them. After all, the origins of these three old men were truly enormously grand. They were the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders.

Even though the three of them were all born in different eras, all three of them possessed a much higher seniority than Nangong Beidou. It could be said that the three of them were the people in the Nangong Imperial Clan who possessed the greatest authority. They were the true rulers of the Nangong Imperial Clan.

However, the three of them had all been in closed-door training for over five hundred years now. In this period of over five hundred years, the three of them had not even revealed themselves once.

This was the reason why there were many people from the Nangong Imperial Clan who had never met them before since their births. In fact, there were even many people who thought that the three of them might have already died.

After all, even though Martial Emperors were capable of living for a very long time, it was very difficult for them to live for over ten thousand years.

Thus, in the Holy Land of Martialism, ten thousand years signaled a cycle for the end of an era and the start of a new era.

After ten thousand years, no matter how powerful one might be, they would still end up dying. Replacing them were the people from the new era.

As for these three old men, they had all surpassed the life expectancy of Martial Emperors since long ago. If they hadn’t relied on miracle medicines to continue their lives, they would likely have already died.

In fact, there were many experts from the older generation who would end up dying of old age in closed-door training. Not to mention others, their Nangong Imperial Clan had also had many such experts.

However, it was evident today that the three Utmost Exalted Elders were still alive. Furthermore, not only were they still alive, they also still possessed overflowing battle power. This could be seen from the golden dragon that the three of them had jointly created.

After the three Utmost Exalted Elders appeared, Nangong Beidou immediately flew over to them and bent his back to bow to them respectfully.

“Beidou, exactly what has happened here? Why would such a fierce Evil Spirit suddenly appear in our Nangong Imperial Clan?” One of the three Utmost Exalted Elders asked.

“Reporting to the Utmost Exalted Elder, this is a very long story. Beidou also feels very helpless about this,” Nangong Beidou did not know how to explain the situation to them.

“Where’s Nangong Longjian? Is he not in the clan?” Another Utmost Exalted Elder asked.

“Lil brother Longjian, he...” Nangong Beidou sighed, “He is in the clan. However, you all also know of his nature. All he cares about is martial cultivation. He simply does not place the safety of our clan in his heart. He does not care about our lives,” Nangon Beidou said while sighing helplessly.

“It’s been a total of five hundred years now. Yet, Nangong Longjian is still this insensible. We really must lecture him properly,” The last Utmost Exalted Elder said with an expression of anger.

“Enough with the superfluous words. Attack together. Take care of that Evil Spirit first.”

The three Utmost Exalted Elders attacked once again. The golden-bright and dazzling ‘Imperial’ character appeared on their foreheads. They clasped their palms together and began to emit dazzling golden light. Then, the light they emitted began to fuse with one another in the sky, forming another vivid and lifelike golden dragon. The golden dragon immediately charged towards the Asura Evil Spirit to attack it.

Most importantly, this golden dragon was even more powerful than the last golden dragon.

“That must be our Nangong Imperial Clan’s Heaven Taboo Martial Skill, the Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation, right?”

“Amazing! As expected of a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill. Its might is simply too frightening. I truly wonder if I’ll be able to successfully learn it in my lifetime.”

“Stop daydreaming. This Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation is something that even Lord Clan Chief was unable to learn. Even for the three Utmost Exalted Elders, they have to act together in order to use it. Yet you think that you can learn it? You should stop with your delusions. There’s no hope for you to learn it in your lifetime.”

As the golden dragon appeared in the sky, some people from the Nangong Imperial Clan came to know what technique that was. That was not a spirit formation. Rather, it was a martial skill, a legendary Heaven Taboo Martial Skill.

Even though Heaven Taboo Martial Skills were akin to legends, the Nangong Imperial Clan, having existed for so long, did indeed possess a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill. As for this Heaven Taboo Martial Skill, it was the Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation.

No one knew who created the Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation. However, only those who possessed Imperial Bloodlines were capable of learning it. It was the clan protection treasure of the Nangong Imperial Clan.

However, even with this being the case, there were very few people in the history of the Nangong Imperial Clan who actually managed to learn the Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation. For many of the Nangong Imperial Clansmen, they had only heard about the divine might of this Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation from textual records.

And now, they were finally able to see it for themselves. Naturally, they would be extremely excited and emotional. After all, this was the strongest ability that the Nangong Imperial Clan possessed.

“But, will that Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation be able to prevail against that monster?” However, even though the Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation possessed unrivalled divine power, there were still people who questioned it.

“Wuuaouuu~~~”

It turned out that their questionings hit right at the mark. The reason for that was because that Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation was once again being ruthlessly bitten by that black dragon transformed from the Asura Evil Spirit. Furthermore, this time around, it was even more ruthless than before. The black dragon had actually torn the golden dragon to bits right in the middle of the sky.

“Puu~~~”

“Puu~~~”

“Puu~~~”

At the moment when the golden dragon was being torn to bits, the three Utmost Exalted Elders all vomited mouthfuls of blood. Then, they stepped back several steps in midair. If it wasn’t for Nangong Beidou immediately supporting them with his martial power, they would likely have fallen from the sky.

At this moment, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were terrified. Even with the three Utmost Exalted Elders coming out and using their Nangong Imperial Clan’s clan protection martial skill, the Heaven Taboo: Golden Dragon Transformation, they were still unable to defeat this Asura Evil Spirit. With all this, who could possibly be able to stop it? Could it be that the Nangong Imperial Clan would truly perish today?

At this moment, one of the Utmost Exalted Elders loudly shouted, “Nangong Longjian, how much longer are you going to watch with folded arms? Are you really going to watch as our Nangong Imperial Clan is destroyed?”

His voice resonated through the sky and echoed through an area of over ten thousand miles.

“Boom~~~”

Right at this moment, a sudden explosion was heard. An enormous golden sword suddenly dropped from the sky. The sword was aimed at that Asura Evil Spirit.

When that enormous golden sword appeared, an incomparably powerful might descended from the sky and covered everyone.

It was as if that aura was the strongest existence in all of heaven and earth.
