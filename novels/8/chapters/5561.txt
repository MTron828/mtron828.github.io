Chapter 5561: Meeting Little Fishy

“What did you notice?” Eggy asked.

“These formation armors aren’t complete. It has one more step to go before completion. I’m unable to tell what the final step is, but the fact that it’s incomplete makes it much easier for me to tamper with them. I can bury a formation inside them and turn them into mine” Chu Feng said.

How confident are you of hiding it from Jie Tian?” Eggy asked worriedly.

As much as she disliked Jie Tian, she had to admit that the other party was a highly gifted world spiritist. To make things worse, Chu Feng was at a disadvantage in terms of their spirit power. Should Jie Tian discover that something was amiss, he wouldn’t hesitate to hurt Chu Feng.

The unique nature of the Star Sea Realm had sealed off Chu Feng’s martial power and spirit power. It was hard to tell whether his father’s protective formation could be invoked here or not. Under such circumstances, Eggy didn’t want any mishap to occur.

“To be honest, I don’t have the absolute confidence to pull it off, but we’ll have to take this risk. I’ll really become Jie Tian’s puppet if I don’t do anything,” Chu Feng said.

“Let’s do it then,” Eggy voiced her support.

She knew that Chu Feng was also doing this for Little Fishy’s sake. He couldn’t bear seeing Little Fishy in danger, especially now that he was aware of Jie Tian’s ploy.

Chu Feng carefully constructed eighteen formations and planted them inside each of the formation armors.

A day passed, and Jie Tian promptly returned.

The first thing he did was to glance at the formation armors. Chu Feng noticed that it wasn’t just an ordinary glance; Jie Tian was using a special detection method.

Jie Tian was truly a bundle of contradictions. On the one hand, he was extremely confident in himself, but on the other hand, he was extremely cautious in his every move. Fortunately, he didn’t notice the formations Chu Feng had planted in the formation armors.

Chu Feng hadn’t been studying the spirit power in the underground sea of energy in vain.

Even though his spirit power was beneath Jie Tian’s, his control over the spirit power in this realm was definitely far above that of the latter.

“Are you able to control them?” Jie Tian asked.

Chu Feng quickly constructed a formation to activate the formation armors. He made sure to put on a laborious front, though he eventually succeeded in activating five formation armors.

“I’ll give you another day to become more proficient at controlling the formation armors,” Jie Tian said before taking his leave.”

“Is it just me or does he seem very busy?” Eggy asked.

“He seems to be doing something,” Chu Feng said.

“Is he preparing something? Or is he communicating with the evil power?” Eggy guessed.

“Whichever the case, he’s bound to be up to no good,” Chu Feng said.

He could easily control eighteen formation armors, let alone five, thus there was nothing for him to prepare at all. Nevertheless, he didn’t slack around. He took his time to strengthen himself and the formation he had planted inside the formation armors. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

A day passed, and Jie Tian came on time again.

This time, his face looked a little pale. Despite his best attempt to conceal it, Chu Feng was still able to see through it. Without a doubt, Jie Tian must have significantly depleted his spirit power.

Before Jie Tian could say a word, Chu Feng immediately constructed a formation to control the formation armors. He made sure to put on a strenuous look this time too, just to a lesser extent compared to yesterday.

“Good job. I didn’t pick the wrong man.” Jie Tian nodded in satisfaction, but all of a sudden, he looked at Chu Feng with incredibly sharp eyes. “Now that I think about it, you have never called me lord. Are you looking down on me? Do you think I’m unworthy of being your master?”

“Lord Jie Tian, you’re thinking too much,” Chu Feng quickly replied.

He didnt have any problem with lowering his head. It was not as if he would lose a piece of meat calling Jie Tian ‘lord’. He wasn’t so weak as to be undermined by small formalities like this.

He believed that a man should lower his head when necessary. The outcome was more important than the process, though that was under the condition that it didn’t undermine his principles.

“Heh…” Jie Tian smiled in glee.

“What’s that fellow getting so gleeful for then?” Eggy berated.

“It’s fine. Let him be gleeful for now. He’ll have plenty to cry about later.”

In contrast to Eggy, Chu Feng wasn’t angered in the least.

Shoosh!

Just then, Jie Tian waved his sleeves and imprinted a formation on Chu Feng. It was a binding formation that completely sealed off Chu Feng’s ability to use spirit power, speak, and even send voice transmission.

“I’ll be frank, 521. I’m doing this because I don’t trust you, but I’ll reward you handsomely as long as you obey my orders. If you dare go against my will, I’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death. Carefully think it through, all right?” Jie Tian said as he constructed a formation space.

He was telling Chu Feng to enter the formation space if the latter was willing to serve him. Without any hesitation, Chu Feng entered the formation space.

The formation space was extremely small, though Chu Feng could see and hear what was happening outside. This allowed him to see Jie Tian stow away the eighteen formation armors even after the formation space had been closed.

Jie Tian left the underground palace afterward. The emaciated elder, who was waiting for him outside, stepped forward and respectfully bowed to him, “Milord.”

Chu Feng could tell from the emaciated elder’s respectful attitude that he must have defected to the evil power, and that he was aware that Chu Feng had defected as well.

Jie Tian didn’t bother sparing a glance at the emaciated elder and walked right past him, and the emaciated elder humbly followed him.

The two of them soon arrived at a massive barrier that covered the entire sky. It was incredibly beautiful, looking as if it had the starry sky fused in it. The barrier was also extremely powerful as well.

“What’s that? Is that the Star Memorial Domain?” Eggy asked.

“I’m not sure, but I’d guess so,” Chu Feng replied.

There had been no interaction between Jie Tian and the emaciated old man along the way, so Chu Feng and Eggy could only guess what was going on. As they came closer, two silhouettes came into Chu Feng’s line of sight.

One was the female chief elder who took away the formation armor Chu Feng had modified for Little Fishy. The other one was a lady dressed in green who made his heart hasten.

Chu Feng knew right away who the lady in the green dress was.

“I knew it. Back then, I thought that lass would become a beauty when she grows up, but I didn’t think she would become this beautiful,” Eggy remarked.

The ravishing woman in the green dress was none other than the mischievous Little Fishy they had met back at the Eastern Sea Region.
