Chapter 4893: Too Terrifying

“Chu Feng, stop! Stop it right now! I was the one who did you wrong. I’ll take responsibility for it all! If you wish to punish anyone, you can punish me! Don’t harm anyone else from our Holy Valley!”

Shengguang Menglai was completely flustered. She wouldn’t be able to face her ancestors if she were to kill the juniors with her own hands, even if she was under Chu Feng’s control.

“Brother Chu Feng, Menglai might have done wrong, but there’s no need to go this far!” Shengguang Chuyao began pleading on her behalf.

“Young master Chu Feng, it’ll do for you to just punish the two of them. There’s no need to kill anyone here!” Shengguang Xintian added.

“Very well. Since Brother Chuyao and Miss Xintian have spoken up on your behalf, I’ll show mercy here. Shengguang Menglai, do you mean it when you said that you would take all of the responsibility for this?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, I’ll bear the consequences of my action. I was the one who took your energy away and told Shengguang Haoxuan to attack you. I fully understand that you’re unhappy about it, but I ask you to vent your anger on me. This has nothing to do with the rest of them!” Shengguang Menglai said.

“You’re pathetic, but at least you have some backbone. I won’t kill anyone here, but you need to be punished for your own mistakes. Otherwise, it’ll never get into your thick skulls. Other than Brother Chuyao and Miss Xintian, none of you from the Holy Valley know the slightest thing about gratitude, so none of you will be cultivating anymore.

“Brother Chuyao and Miss Xintian, you may continue. Hurry up and grasp the fortune in the air,” Chu Feng said.

Shengguang Menglai raised her hand, and the light barrier trapping Shengguang Chuyao and Shengguang Xintian dissipated. Everyone knew that this was Chu Feng’s doing.

“Thank you, young master Chu Feng.”

Shengguang Xintian smiled sweetly at Chu Feng before sitting down. She didn’t bother sparing a glance at the others from the Holy Valley.

“Brother Chu Feng...”

Shengguang Chuyao still wanted to speak up for the other juniors of the Holy Valley.

“Brother Chuyao, this is the limit of my patience. I’m already being merciful here. Hurry up and cultivate. Don’t waste your time here.

“Ah, you asked me earlier what the other cultivation method is. I’ll tell you now. Look closely, the method is actually quite simple. As long as you use these hand seals, you’ll be able to draw the fortune in the vicinity toward you.

“It’s just that the fortune you sense and acquire will be gentler in nature whereas those you draw toward you using this method will be violent. That’s why I don’t recommend you to use this method. However, if you insist on giving it a try, I won’t stop you.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he crossed his legs, sat down on the ground, and formed a set of unique hand seals.

Shengguang Xintian also opened her eyes to see what Chu Feng was doing.

Weng!

The moment the set of hand seals were completed, the space around Chu Feng suddenly began quivering. Following that, the crowd could visibly see a steady stream of aura flowing toward Chu Feng’s body.

This aura carried a violent and dangerous vibe, but Chu Feng remained unharmed despite taking it into his body. There wasn’t even the slightest fluctuation in his emotions.

Seeing this, Shengguang Chuyao quickly settled on the ground and tried the method Chu Feng had just imparted to him.

“Big brother Chuyao, are you really going to give it a try? You should have sensed the dangerous vibe coming from it,” Shengguang Xintian tried to dissuade him from it.

“Xintian, risks and gains come hand in hand. I need to at least give it a try,” Shengguang Chuyao replied with a smile.

He began forming a series of hand seals.

Weng!

Once it was completed, the space around him shuddered, and a dangerous aura started converging around him. It was just that the amount of aura paled in comparison to Chu Feng’s.

Uwa!

However, the moment the aura started seeping into Shengguang Chuyao’s body, he began vomiting a huge amount of blood. Even though he stopped right away, he still continued to cough violently. With every cough, a huge amount of blood would spurt from his mouth, causing him to weaken significantly.

At this rate, he might just lose his life.

Shoosh!

A figure rushed up to him and smacked the top of his head.

It was Chu Feng.

With sheer force, he absorbed the dangerous aura that had entered Shengguang Chuyao. Only after this every last bit of dangerous aura was gone did Shengguang Chuyao’s coughing finally stopped.

“Brother Chu Feng, thank you for saving my life.”

Shengguang Chuyao knew deep well that he might have just lost his life if Chu Feng hadn’t intervened.

‘Brother Chuyao, there’s no need to thank me. However, I hope that you can remind Shengguang Menglai to learn her lesson and not mess with me anymore. If she dares to pull anything else, you can be certain that I won’t show mercy a second time.”

Chu Feng shot a deep look at Shengguang Menglai as he said those words.

Shengguang Chuyao couldn’t understand what Chu Feng was driving at. Given that Shengguang Menglai had already admitted her mistake, why would she continue messing with Chu Feng?

All of a sudden, Chu Feng flitted off and entered the spirit formation gate located at the center of the palace, leaving the place. His actions confused Shengguang Chuyao, Shengguang Xintian, and the other juniors present. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

They couldn’t understand why Chu Feng would leave all of a sudden.

He should have stayed here with them and continued cultivating.

Kacha!

The next moment, a shattering sound echoed from Shengguang Menglai’s arm. It was from the Holy Lotus Rock. Cracks had started forming on it.

Peng!

There was a dull thud right after, and the Holy Lotus Rock shattered entirely.

At the same time, the white light infused into the Holy Lotus Rock dissipated into the surroundings.

“He sure escaped fast.”

Shengguang Menglai looked at the spirit formation gate in the center of the palace as she spoke.

“Menglai, what’s going on? Why would the Holy Lotus Rock suddenly shatter? Is it Chu Feng’s doing?” Shengguang Chuyao asked.

“I was the one who did it,” Shengguang Menglai replied.

“You did it... yourself? Why?”

The crowd was baffled.

Why would Shengguang Menglai destroy something as precious as the Holy Lotus Rock?

“I would have remained under his control in this cultivation realm if I hadn’t shattered it. I can’t allow him to continue governing out fates any longer,” Shengguang Menglai said.

“So... Chu Feng ran away because he sensed that you were going to shatter the Holy Lotus Rock?” a junior of the Holy Valley asked.

“I’m not sure, but if that’s really the case... he’d really be a frightening individual.”

Shengguang Menglai looked at the spirit formation gate in the middle of the palace with a conflicted expression.

She had secretly destroyed the Holy Lotus Rock so as to avoid alarming Chu Feng. If Chu Feng was still able to notice it despite her concealment, it would mean that his senses were frighteningly astute.
