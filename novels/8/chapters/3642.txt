Chapter 3642 - The Ultimate Profoundness

“Nangong Yifan, I’m afraid that you have not managed to see through the ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand.’”

“The Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand’s primary profoundness is in setting up a formation. However, that was merely used to confuse others. In fact, the formation taught by the Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand is inferior to that of other chess strategies.”

“Because of that, many people were confused by the primary profoundness, and thought that the ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand’ was a completely useless chess strategy. They did not know that it was merely a puzzle, a trick, of the ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand.’”

“It is only when one can determine the mid-level profoundness that one would discover the essence of the ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand, the utilization of one’s chess power in controlling treasures, making all the chess power treasures serve oneself.”

“You are indeed different from others. You possess a very strong attainment in chess power, as you’ve managed to discover the mid-level profoundness.”

“However, that is only the Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand’s mid-level profoundness, and not its ultimate profoundness.”

“As for the ultimate profoundness of the ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand,’ it is to turn the chess power present in the world into one’s own.”

“I know that the chess strategy that you’ve meticulously studied also possesses the means to disregard the rules and control chess power.”

“Because of that, you were able to accomplish feats impossible for ordinary people. In the chess formation, you possess absolute power.”

“However, I can tell you this with certainty. The abilities that you’ve grasped are also grasped by me. Furthermore, what I’ve grasped far surpasses what you have.”

“That is the reason why the ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand’ is the most difficult chess strategy to master, whereas the chess strategy that you’ve meticulously studied is only mid-tier,” said Chu Feng.

“So the ultimate profoundness of the ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand’ is also controlling chess power? Furthermore, it’s controlling all the chess power present in the world?”

“In that case, wouldn’t that mean Chu Feng’s chess power surpasses Nangong Yifan’s?”

Hearing what Chu Feng had said, all the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were terrified.

They who were previously filled with confidence became afraid.

They were afraid that they would lose, afraid that they would fail. The fear that they felt was greater than anyone else’s.

Those who had failed often would not be afraid of failure. After all, they would grow accustomed to failure after a while.

However, those that had never failed would find it very difficult to accept failure, for they felt that failure would leave a stain that would remain for their entire life. They believed that failure was extremely humiliating, so much so that they would not be able to lift their heads again. Failure would also make their lives no longer perfect.

Thus, at that moment, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were truly afraid. They were afraid that their legendary undefeated record would be ruined by Chu Feng.

“Enough of your bullshit! What you’ve trained in is a heretical technique! What I’ve trained in is the orthodox ability for chess power!”

“Right now, I’ll have you know what sort of might real chess power possesses!”

After saying those words, Nangong Yifan placed his palms together.

“Rumble~~~”

Heaven and earth started to tremble violently. The ground began to rupture. Even the sky started to shatter.

At that moment, the crowd were able to clearly see chess power visible to the naked eye erupting from Nangong Yifan’s body and soaring straight into the sky like a volcanic explosion.

Soon, the chess power had turned into a giant dragon.

The dragon was enormous, with a length measuring tens of thousands of meters.

“Too powerful! That is simply too powerful!”

Seeing the soaring giant dragon, the crowd felt their hair stand on end. Involuntarily, their bodies began to tremble.

In the chess formation, just being able to release one’s chess power from one’s body was an extraordinary ability for the crowd.

Yet, Nangong Yifan was actually able to condense such an enormous and powerful dragon with his chess power.

The disparity between the crowd’s chess power and Nangong Yifan’s chess power was simply as vast as the disparity between a stream and the ocean.

“Th, th, this is your chess power?”

Chu Feng’s voice was suddenly heard. However, his voice no longer possessed the arrogance from before. Instead, his voice was filled with fear.

In fact, one could even see that Chu Feng’s legs were trembling. He was so afraid that he could not even stand firmly.

“Chu Feng, can you feel it? This is true chess power! Do you now know what sort of might it possesses?” Seeing the fear on Chu Feng’s face, Nangong Yifan became extremely pleased. He was unable to keep himself from revealing a smile on his face.

“I can feel it. Your chess power is indeed extraordinary. Likely, you’ve managed to absorb one tenth of the total chess power in this entire world,” Chu Feng’s voice was trembling as he spoke.

“Haha. This is truly unexpected. Serves him right. What happened to his arrogance from before? Didn’t he declare that the entire world was his? Didn’t he say that he had grasped the ultimate profoundness of the ‘Marvelous Technique To Breach An Army Of Ten Thousand?’ Why is his voice trembling now?”

“Truth be told, that Chu Feng is quite capable too. Unfortunately, his opponent is Nangong Yifan. He’s like a wolf that has encountered a tiger. No matter how strong he might be, he will still have no choice but to admit defeat.”

“Even though I already knew that Yifan was very powerful, never did I imagine him to be this powerful. That Chu Feng’s defeat is well-justified.”

“His defeat is well-justified indeed. Hahaha!!!”

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations became extremely excited.

Many people even began to ridicule Chu Feng.

“Shut it! You all possess no qualifications to insult Chu Feng! Which one of you could possibly compare to him?!”

Someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations shouted angrily. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They were no longer able to tolerate the insults.

In the beginning, they felt deep disgust for Chu Feng. However, at that moment, they were able to tell that the only reason such a fierce battle was able to occur in the chess formation was all thanks to Chu Feng.

Even though they were still slightly displeased with him, they were unable to tolerate the people from the All-heaven Starfield’s insults towards him.

No matter who lost and who won, it was Chu Feng who had brought them hope. It was Chu Feng who had supported them till that point.

“What’s this? Are you all unhappy with our comments?”

“While it’s true that Chu Feng is very powerful, so what? Is he capable of defeating our Nangong Yifan?”

“No matter how powerful he might be, he’s nothing more than trash when compared to our Nangong Yifan.”

“Did you all really think that just because a Chu Feng appeared on your Ancestral Martial Starfield’s side this time around that you would be capable of defeating our All-heaven Starfield?”

“Oh, you all must’ve thought that you had won earlier. I cannot apologize enough, we’ve truly let you down. You’ve finally managed to see the dawn of victory after so long, yet it was extinguished by Yifan. Yifan is truly a bit too excessive.”

“However, there’s nothing that can be done about that. You all also know that the chess matches are said to be a sparring session between the younger generations; they are actually a showdown between the two starfields. No matter how pitiful you might be, we will still not throw the match.”

“Regardless of whether or not you hate us, you can only blame yourselves for being inferior.”

“If you want to blame something, you can only blame your Ancestral Martial Starfield for only having incompetent trash.”

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations had ugly looks on their faces, and began to insult the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations with no restraint.

“You all must’ve forgotten whose territory this is.”

The Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were all completely enraged.

Not only were they gnashing their teeth with ominous glints in their eyes, but those with more irritable tempers even released their oppressive might.

“Come! As if we’re afraid of you! You are all incompetent in the chess formation, and are even more incompetent outside the chess formation!”

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were not to be outdone either. They also unleashed their martial power. They seemed like they were going to start fighting the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations.

“All of you, quiet down!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. Not only that, but an overwhelming oppressive might was also felt. That oppressive might forcibly suppressed all the other oppressive might present.

The reason for that was because it was the oppressive might of a peak Exalted.

It was Lord Shoujian.

“I don’t care where you’re from. I don’t care which power you have behind you. However, you all need to remember that this place... is the Divine Armament Villa!”

“This old man does not care how you conduct yourselves and what you do outside. However, in this place, you all must behave yourselves.”

“If anyone dares to hinder this old man’s observation, don’t blame this old man for being impolite.”

Lord Shoujian’s brows were narrowed. His voice akin to thunder. Each word he spoke shook the crowd’s hearts like a giant hammer.

His words had intimidated all the people of the younger generation.

Thus, at that moment, the furious people of the younger generation all quieted down.

As for Lord Shoujian, he turned his gaze back to the chess formation after saying those words.

Seeing that, the people of the younger generation also turned their gazes back to the chess formation.

Although it seemed like the outcome was already determined, they still did not wish to miss out on what was going to happen.
