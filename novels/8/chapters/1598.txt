MGA: Chapter 1599 - Weaponry Refinement Completed

“What’s wrong? Are you speechless now? Are you finding it difficult to say anything, or is it that you do not dare to say anything?”

“Beitang Zimo, are you pretending to be stupid? Didn’t you say that I, Chu Feng, am trash? Didn’t you say that I only managed to pass the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s trials because of luck?”

“Trash, who is the actual trash? You, Beitang Zimo, are the actual trash. Not only are you trash, you’re also a spineless coward. You are a coward who dared to accept a gamble, yet didn’t dare to hold up to it after losing,” Nangong Baihe added.

“That’s right. Trash, you are truly shameless!”

“Pah, you are a waste as a prince of the Beitang Imperial Clan. It turns out that you’re nothing more than trash. You have truly shamed the entire Beitang Imperial Clan,” Following Nangong Baihe, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan also started to loudly mock and insult Beitang Zimo.

“Truly shameful. He insulted another so ruthlessly earlier. Yet now, it turns out that he will have to slap himself. Haha... Beitang Imperial Clan? It’s only to this level. They are nowhere as grand as the rumors say.”

“That’s right, it’s as the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan said, this Beitang Zimo is simply trash.”

Most surprisingly, it was not only the Nangong Imperial Clan that started to insult Beitang Zimo. Even the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts began to mock and insult Beitang Zimo.

Other than the Nangong Imperial Clan and the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, no one else dared to say anything about Beitang Zimo. However, this was not because they did not want to say anything. It was not because that they felt that Beitang Zimo was not wrong. Rather, they felt the complete opposite.

At this moment, everyone felt that Beitang Zimo had brought this upon himself, that he was reaping what he had sown. Actually, a lot of people wanted to mock and insult Beitang Zimo too. Merely, due to the strength of the Beitang Imperial Clan, they did not dare to say anything. Thus, they could only restrain themselves and keep their insults and mockeries in their hearts.

Suddenly, Beitang Zimo shouted angrily. “All of you, shut up!!!!”

His angry shout caused the Nangong Imperial Clan and the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts to be even more enraged. They felt that he was being extremely arrogant to dare to shout in this sort of manner at this sort of state.

However, before the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan and the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts could say anything back at Beitang Zimo, Beitang Zimo suddenly raised his arms and began to slap himself in the face. “Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow~~~” A total of ten consecutive slaps ruthlessly landed on his face.

After slapping himself ten times, bloody palm marks appeared on Beitang Zimo’s cheeks. It could be seen that his ten slaps had been extremely ruthless.

“Let’s go,” After the ten slaps, Beitang Zimo turned around, leapt out of the lake and began to leave. The other people from the Beitang Imperial Clan immediately followed after him and hurriedly left the area.

His decision to leave was correct. That was because he already had no face to remain in this place anymore. Today, he had been utterly disgraced.

Actually, this could not be blamed on him. He had been arrogant all his life, and had provoked a lot of people. Furthermore, he should have succeeded earlier too. However, he had failed. The reason for his failure was because he had encountered... someone who he should not have provoked.

At this moment, everyone had turned their gazes to Chu Feng. They wished to see what sort of expression Chu Feng would have on his face. They wanted to know whether he was in great delight or would act extremely prideful?

“Eh? Where’s Chu Feng?”

However, it was only at this moment that the crowd discovered that Chu Feng had disappeared.

The crowd had been focused on Beitang Zimo’s reaction, and had actually overlooked Chu Feng. It would appear that Chu Feng had left for quite some time now. Likely, he had left before Beitang Zimo had started slapping himself.

Even though Chu Feng had left, the crowd’s hearts were unable to calm down. They finally knew that Chu Feng had not passed through the trials by chance. Even though it was very difficult to believe, the talent that Chu Feng had revealed was truly astonishing.

Likely, in the near future, another grand person would appear in the Overlord Domain. As for that person, his name would be Chu Feng.

“Young Island Master, it would appear that it is not that the Cultivation Immortal Pond had a problem, but rather that, that young man by the name of Chu Feng is a demon-level character. He had managed to suck the Cultivation Immortal Lake dry in merely six hours,” The people from the Immortal Island said to Baili Xinghe.

“It would appear to be the case,” Baili Xinghe nodded his head calmly.

Even though he had a calm appearance, his hands within his sleeves were tightly clenched. They were clenched so tightly that his veins were bulging and appeared to be about to burst. A violent storm was raging in his heart.

At this moment, Chu Feng had returned to his residence.

The reason why Chu Feng had returned so quickly was because he knew that he had created an enormous commotion. Likely, there would be a lot of people who would try to worm their way into being friends with him.

Chu Feng did not wish to befriend opportunists. Thus, he had secretly left and returned to his residence.

His residence had been arranged by the people from the Immortal Island. Thus, other than the people from the Immortal Island, no one knew where he lived. As such, Chu Feng did not fear others coming to disturb him.

“What a great feeling. That’s what you should’ve done. Why try to be so secretive? To reveal yourself like this, isn’t it much better?”

“In the world of martial cultivators, the strong are the rulers. If you do not reveal your strength, how can others possibly respect you? Only by revealing your strength will you be able to gain the respect of others.” At this moment, Eggy was exceptionally excited. She was clapping her hands and cheering for Chu Feng nonstop.

“While it is true that I will be able to easily obtain others’ respect by revealing my strength, I will also be envied by others and bring about people who want to kill me,” Chu Feng said.

Actually, if it hadn’t been for Beitang Zimo provoking Chu Feng and attacking him nonstop, Chu Feng would not have revealed his talent and caused such a commotion.

“If anyone dares to try to kill you, you shall kill them. The world of martial cultivators is like this. If you do not bully others, then you will be bullied by others,” Eggy said with an indifferent expression. She wished for Chu Feng to be strong-headed the entire time.

“Heh...” Chu Feng laughed lightly and didn’t say anything. If possible, he also did not wish to be too low-key. That was because if he was too low-key, he would appear to be a weakling. If he were to appear to be weak, then it would be hard to blame others for wanting to bully him.

In the following days, Chu Feng stayed in his residence beside the cliff the entire time. He was waiting for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to finish refining his weapon.

Even though Chu Feng did not leave the Immortal Island the entire time, he had still managed to hear about a lot of news. Beitang Zimo and his Beitang Imperial Clan had left. Many other people had also left.

The reason why had they left so quickly was all because of Chu Feng. Chu Feng had completely sucked the entire Cultivation Immortal Lake dry. Thus, it was meaningless for them to stay. Therefore, they all decided to leave.

Right now, the only people that remained on the Immortal Island were Chu Feng, Tantai Xue, Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe, Nangong Moli and a small number of the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan. One thing worthy of being mentioned was that, for some unknown reason, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts had all stayed as well.

On the seventh day since Chu Feng’s arrival on the Immortal Island, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal called for him again.

It was the same forest and the same thatched hut. The Weaponry Refinement Immortal was still sitting beside the stove.

Merely, this time around, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was not roasting sweet potatoes. Rather, he was roasting potatoes.

He had the same sort of faint smile on his face as he looked to Chu Feng. This time around, unconcealed appreciation and admiration filled his smiling gaze.
