Chapter 4588: I’ll Decimate Your Clan

All of the elders of the Holy Light Clan turned their sights to Shengguang Xuanye. Faced with such a situation, even Shengguang Yunyue was panicking on the inside. The only one who could make a decision here was their clan chief.

“I would like to see just how powerful Chu Feng’s background is!” Shengguang Xuanye harrumphed coldly as he made his way out.

Judging from his attitude, it seemed like he didn’t fear those who had come here to cause trouble. He was initially planning to get rid of Chu Feng first, but there was no time for that anymore. He hurriedly rushed out together with Shengguang Yunyue and the other elders to take a look.

In truth, everyone knew that they were in a shaky position even with the strongest expert of the Holy Light Galaxy on their side. If Chu Feng was still alive, there would still be room for reconciliation. However, if they were to really end Chu Feng’s life, there would be no path of retreat anymore.

If there were any extremely powerful individuals amongst those who had come, their Holy Light Clan would become history.

Thus, Shengguang Xuanye decided to take a look first before making his decision.

...

At this very moment, there were quite a few people who had gathered outside the Holy Light Clan, and many more were rushing over. The person whom most eyes were centered on was no other than a white-robed daoist. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

This daoist was white all over, be it his hair or his clothes, creating an immaculate appearance. Even though it was obvious with a look that he was advanced in age, he seemed exceptionally spirited. It wouldn’t be excessive to describe this man as divine.

However, there was one trait about this elder that was quite striking, and that was his double eyes.

The so-called double eyes referred to the presence of two pupils in each of the eyes. This gave a peculiar twist to his seemingly divine disposition.

The crowd couldn’t help but wonder about his identity. They thought that he could be Chu Feng’s teacher. After all, this double-eyed white-robed daoist had indeed come to save Chu Feng.

But all of a sudden, another huge commotion broke out amidst the crowd.

The top brass of the Holy Light Clan had finally made their appearance, including Shengguang Yunyue and even Shengguang Xuanye.

“It’s actually him...”

From the moment that Shengguang Yunyue saw the white-robed daoist, a knit immediately formed between her eyebrows.

“Elder Yunyue, you recognize that man?” Shengguang Xuanye asked.

The other elders also turned to look at Shengguang Yunyue as they were curious to know who this white-robed daoist was. None of them appeared to be surprised to hear that Shengguang Yunyue recognized the other party.

Most of the elders of the Holy Light Clan, be it the clan chief or the other Supreme Elders, spent their days either in closed-door training or within the clan. Very few of them bothered to venture out of the Holy Light Galaxy.

However, it was different for Shengguang Yunyue. She liked to disguise herself and wander around the place. Due to that, her knowledge of the world and important figures was much broader than that of the others, and this included Shengguang Xuanye too.

In fact, she was the one bringing back the bulk of the critical intelligence that the Holy Light Clan currently knew.

“He’s the Double-eyed Daoist who has once destroyed an entire world. I told you about him before,” Shengguang Yunyue said.

“It’s him?”

The gazes of Shengguang Xuanye and the others turned grim.

The Double-eyed Daoist was from the Nine Souls Galaxy, and he was known to be a vicious character. He had done a lot of vile deeds, but due to his practice of silencing all eye-witnesses, there were very few people knew of his heinous crimes, which led to him being little known.

Even Shengguang Yunyue only knew about him due to her chancing upon him on one of his massacres.

After learning that the other party was the notorious Double-eyed Daoist, the tense nerves of the experts of the Holy Light Clan loosened a little.

While they knew that the Double-eyed Daoist was a vicious character, according to Shengguang Yunyue, his cultivation was at rank three Martial Exalted level. This meant that he was no match for Shengguang Yunyue, let alone Shengguang Xuanye.

They could easily deal with him.

“Let go of Chu Feng, or else we’ll decimate your entire clan!”

All of a sudden, a furious howl boomed from a distance away, causing even the air to tremor.

Turning toward the source of the sound, they saw a fat monk wearing kasaya flitting in their direction with a vicious look on his face. He was wielding long chains with several figures bound on it. Taking a closer look, these figures were all members of the Holy Light Clan!

“It’s him! What is he doing here?”

Compared to the Double-eyed Daoist, the fat monk seemed to boast a greater reputation.

Putting aside Shengguang Yunyue and Shengguang Xuanye, even some of the onlookers around were able to recognize him too.

The fat monk was from the Nine Souls Galaxy too. Despite being dressed as a monk, it was probably better not to classify him as one. Monks were people who sought to do good, but this fat monk was unscrupulous, committing all sorts of heinous deeds like plundering and murder. It was rumored that he was a cannibal too.

Due to that, the world came to know him as the Cannibal Monk.

The Cannibal Monk was much stronger than the Double-eyed Daoist, his cultivation level being at rank four Martial Exalted level.

When the Cannibal Monk made his appearance, the crowd from the Holy Light Clan, who had just composed themselves a little, began feeling uneasy once more.

The Double-eyed Daoist might not be a cause for fear, but the Cannibal Monk was definitely not a figure to be underestimated.

And on top of the two of them, there was still another beggarly old man who was here for Chu Feng too. If this beggarly old man was even stronger than the Cannibal Monk, things would really be difficult for the Holy Light Clan.

“Double-eyed Daoist, Cannibal Monk, our Holy Light Clan has no grudge with you. Why are you causing trouble on our grounds?” Shengguang Yunyue asked with a raised voice.

The reason why she spoke in place of Shengguang Xuanye was that she felt that neither the Double-eyed Daoist and Cannibal Monk were worthy of speaking to Shengguang Xuanye directly.

They were in the Holy Light Galaxy after all, and the people of the Holy Light Galaxy were looking at them. Even if they were concerned about the situation, they still had to put on airs as the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy.

Yet, who could have thought that Shengguang Yunyue’s words would be responded with contempt?

“Cut the crap and release Chu Feng. Otherwise, our master is going to decimate your clan!”
