Chapter 4061 - Purple Star Hall’s Gift

After Bai Liluo’s condition was stabilized, Chu Feng used the curse technique he had acquired in the Reincarnation Upper Realm to attempt to remove her curse.

To Chu Feng’s surprise, the curse Bai Liluo had been inflicted with was simply too powerful. He was unable to do anything about it.

This made him extremely distressed.

After all, he had personally witnessed the appearance of Bai Liluo being tortured by the curse.

He did not wish for her to continue being tortured by the curse for the rest of her life.

“It’s alright. You don’t have to worry about it.”

“I am the one inflicted with this curse, I know best whether or not I’ll be okay.”

“The curse has not flared up for a very long time now. It did not even emerge during the crucial moment of my closed-door training. Else, my closed-door training wouldn’t have been this successful.”

“Besides, it is all thanks to that Black-feathered Specter that your big sister’s cultivation was able to increase this much.”

“Although I failed to refine it, I still managed to gain an enormous amount of benefit from it.”

“As such, your big sister will have to continue her closed-door training. I cannot let this opportunity slip by. If that power dissipates from my body, it would be an enormous loss.”

“I must utilize the remnant power of that Black-feathered Specter in my body before it disappears.”

“As for the Chu Heavenly Clan, you don’t have to worry about it either. I am able to sense the situation outside. If dangers truly arise, I will not ignore them.”

“Actually, I’d already exited my closed-door training when your clan chief was in a crisis earlier. It’s just that when I saw your return, I immediately returned to my training,” said Bai Liluo.

“Big sister Liluo, I’ll take care of the matters with my clan. You don’t have to worry.”

“Since your current condition is so urgent, you shouldn’t waste time, and should return to training,” urged Chu Feng.

With that, Bai Liluo returned to her training.

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all very curious about the matter regarding the Blue Talisman Clan.

Bai Liluo had clearly been holding the upper hand in the battle when a voice suddenly appeared, and then both she and Chu Feng were sealed off.

When the power sealing them disappeared, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen not only saw no sight of the person who had spoken, but even the blue-gowned individual who wanted to massacre their Chu Heavenly Clan had disappeared.

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all very curious as to what had happened.

However, Chu Feng did not tell them anything. Since he had agreed to keep the matter confidential for Lanfu Longping, he would naturally have to abide by his promise.

Seeing that Chu Feng was unwilling to tell them, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others also stopped asking him about it.

After all, to them, everything would be fine as long as Chu Feng and Bai Liluo remained safe.

In the following days, Chu Feng also entered closed-door training for a while.

He attempted to refine the Sacred Tree Seed inside his body.

He also attempted to communicate with the miraculously fast Divine Deer.

Chu Feng knew that if he could refine the Divine Tree Seed, he would definitely be able to make progress in his cultivation.

As for that Divine Deer, if he could grasp its power, it would become an ability that could save his life in crucial moments.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng failed in both of his attempts.

He was unable to refine the Sacred Tree Seed, and unable to communicate with the Divine Deer.

In the blink of an eye, it was time to proceed for the Purple Star Hall.

The Chu Heavenly Clan had made preparations for this grand occasion.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng and many other experts of the Chu Heavenly Clan would all be going.

Only Chu Xuanzhengfa and the people from the Law Enforcement Hall would remain to guard the Chu Heavenly Clan.

If they were the only ones remaining, they would naturally not be able to truly protect the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, with Bai Liluo in closed-door training in the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were not worried.

They were not afraid of anything happening to them. Instead, they were afraid that if something were to happen, they’d affect Bai Liluo’s closed-door training. After all, they’d all witnessed the backlash she’d suffered from forcibly exiting her closed-door training.

They did not wish to interrupt her if at all possible.

......

Although the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not wish for Chu Feng to journey with them, his mood grew much better when he really ended up accompanying them.

Chu Hanpeng even said that it had been a very long time since he last saw the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiling so much.

The joyous smile remained on the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s face the entire journey.

Everyone knew why he was so happy.

It was naturally because of Chu Feng.

When Chu Feng had first returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the great majority of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen had all rejected him, and had looked down on him.

It was their Lord Clan Chief who had firmly believed in Chu Feng and had protected him.

And now, the accomplishments he had made had proved to everyone that their Lord Clan Chief’s insight had not been mistaken.

Chu Feng was the hope of their Chu Heavenly Clan. It was he who had brought their Chu Heavenly Clan their current glory.

After journeying in the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation for some time, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen finally arrived at the Purple Star Hall’s location -- the Purple Star Upper Realm!

This place was named the Purple Star Upper Realm not because it was under the control of the Purple Star Hall.

The name Purple Star Upper Realm was actually even older than the Purple Star Hall itself...

It was instead the Purple Star Hall who had named themselves after the Purple Star Upper Realm.

This upper realm had been named the Purple Star Upper Realm since the Ancient Era.

The reason why it was named such was because of a special cultivation plant located in the Purple Star Upper Realm. The Purple Star Wisteria.

The Purple Star Wisteria was a special kind of cultivation resource.

Furthemore, this flowering vine was found only in the Purple Star Upper Realm.

If a Purple Star Wisteria was brought away from the Purple Star Upper Realm, it would immediately die.

Furthermore, the Purple Star Wisteria was not a plant that could be cultivated.

It could only be grown in nature. Furthermore, the place where it would grow every year was different.

Most importantly, only the Purple Star Hall possessed the authority to use the Purple Star Wisterias.

If other powers or other cultivators not belonging to the Purple Star Hall dared to cultivate with Purple Star Wisterias, they would’ve committed a capital offense.

Of course, the Purple Star Wisterias were not that easy to find.

They possessed characteristics similar to those of natural oddities, and would conceal themselves.

When they were concealed, one would not be able to detect them even if one were to walk over them.

Unless one were an extremely strong world spiritist, only the Purple Star Hall’s Purple Star Lens would be able to detect Purple Star Wisterias.

Actually, the Purple Star Hall had mentioned the Purple Star Wisterias in the invitation letter they’d given to the Chu Heavenly Clan. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They had presented a gift to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, this gift was something that they needed to seek themselves.

This gift was the Purple Star Wisterias.

On the invitation letter, it stated that during the time that the Chu Heavenly Clan was in their Purple Star Upper Realm, they could refine Purple Star Wisterias and use them for cultivation purposes if they were to discover any.

Of course, the invitation letter listed that they would only have one opportunity.

In other words, if they were to refine the Purple Star Wisterias from the first site, they would not be allowed to refine more should they discover another site full of them.

Of course, if the Chu Heavenly Clan failed to find any Purple Star Wisterias, they would miss out on this great gift, and the Purple Star Hall would not offer them their prepared Purple Star Wisterias.

Speaking of this, it was truly a coincidence that right after Chu Feng walked out of the Ancient Era’s teleportation formation, he discovered a sea of Purple Star Wisterias.

Furthermore, it was an extremely vast sea of flowers!
