Chapter 5886: The Clan Chief’s Son

The two elders at the entrance winced. They wanted to say something, but they turned around and held their tongue given young master Qiutian’s identity.

In contrast, Chu Feng was much calmer.

“You need to be responsible for your words. Do you know what you’re saying?” Chu Feng asked.

“That woman named Zi Ling is your woman, right? Someone’s going to take her in as a concubine. If you’re a man, the least you can do is to rescue her,” young master Qiutian said.

“You know where Zi Ling is?”

“I do, but you have to first defeat me if you want to know your woman’s whereabouts.” Young master Qiutian released his aura as a rank five Half-God level cultivator.

“Aiyo! The hell!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The next moment, young master Qiutian crumbled to the floor with a yelp of agony. He had been suppressed by a surge of spirit power. Several formation swords floated above him.

The two elders barged in upon hearing young master Qiutian’s yelp. When they saw what had happened, they anxiously raised their hands and cried out, “Please stop, young hero Chu Feng! Young master Qiutian is our clan chief’s only son!”

This revealed young master Qiutian’s identity. No wonder the two elders were fearful of him.

Chu Feng dispelled his spirit power and formation swords with a wave of his hand.

The two elders quickly rushed forward to support young master Qiutian, but the latter pushed them off and said, “No need. I’ll get up on my own.”

Young master Qiutian got up and stared at Chu Feng with a solemn face. Out of the blue, he suddenly burst into laughter. “Hahahaha! As expected of Elder Chu Xuanyuan’s son. You live up to your reputation as the strongest junior of the present generation. I, Sansheng Qiutian, shall recognize you!”

“Can you tell me where Zi Ling is now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. I’ll bring you there. Follow me.”

Sansheng Qiutian rose to the sky, and Chu Feng followed him.

“You’re Chu Feng, right? I am Sansheng Qiutian, the son of the incumbent Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief,” Sansheng Qiutian said along the way.

“I know. Those two elders mentioned it,” Chu Feng replied.

“It’s different. You’re hearing it from my mouth this time. Is your father really not here?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“He isn’t here,” Chu Feng replied.

“He actually let you come here alone. Elder Chu Xuanyuan sure is brave. This doesn’t sound like him,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“You met my father before?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course.”

“What is my father like?”

“Shouldn’t you know better what your father is like? Or is there a conflict between the two of you?”

Chu Feng felt like Sansheng Qiutian was trying to probe him, so he didn’t answer that question. Instead, he asked, “Are you sure you know where Zi Ling is?”

“Of course. I came here to relay the news to you. I’m amazed at how relaxed you are despite hearing that your woman is about to become someone else’s concubine. Don’t you love her?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“So what you’re saying is true?”

“Of course.”

“Who is it?”

“Sansheng Xingyu, the most talented but also the most arrogant junior in our Three Saints Monstrous Clan. He fell in love with Zi Ling at first sight and insisted on taking her in as his concubine,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“Is this your father’s doing?” Chu Feng asked, knowing that it was the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief who took Zi Ling away.

No matter what Sanshen Xingyu or Sansheng Qiutian was up to, it must have something to do with the clan chief.

“How does this have anything to do with my father? Sansehng Xingyu was the bold and lustful one for trying to take your woman as his concubine!” Sansheng Qiutian exclaimed in an attempt to defend his father.

Chu Feng didn’t say a word. This matter went beyond what he could tolerate. If something truly happened to Zi Ling, he wouldn’t spare the Three Saints Monstrous Clan regardless of their ties with his father.

Chu Feng and Sansheng Qiutian quickly advanced. They were still in the city, but the scenery beneath them were mountains and rivers. They had entered a private territory.

“This is Sansheng Xingyu’s residence. I can only bring you this far. You’re a world spiritist; you should be able to find him,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

Chu Feng flew across the mountains alone and soon saw a gazebo in the middle of a lake. A person was standing in the gazebo. His height and physique resembled that of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan, but he was wearing clothes reminiscent of a human scholar.

Sansheng Xingyu would have known that Sansheng Qiutian had tipped him off, so this was an open ploy. Thus, Chu Feng didn’t bother concealing himself before approaching the other party.

The scholar raised his head and looked at Chu Feng. “Chu Feng?”

“You’re Sansheng Xingyu?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am.” Sansheng Xingyu walked out of the gazebo and flitted across the air. With just a few steps, he ascended to the same height as Chu Feng.

“Where’s Zi Ling?” Chu Feng asked.

“Clear my trial, and I’ll bring you to her,” Sansheng Xingyu replied.

Boom!

Spirit power suddenly gushed at Sansheng Xingyu.

Chu Feng was worried about Zi Ling. Just because he appeared calm on the surface didn’t mean that he was in a mood to play games. Since the other party knew why he was here and stated a straightforward request, he couldn’t be bothered to waste time on words.

In response, Sansheng Xingyu released his martial power, distorting the surrounding space. His cultivation swiftly soared from rank seven Half-God level to rank nine Half-God level.

But instead of counterattacking, he manifested a barrier and blocked Chu Feng’s attack.

There was no doubt he was powerful, for he was able to block Chu Feng’s attack. Someone with such talent could definitely raise his cultivation by more than two ranks, which meant that rank nine Half-God level was not his limit.

Chu Feng knew that he had met his match.
