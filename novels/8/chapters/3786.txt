Chapter 3786 - Utter Humiliation

Luo Zhi and the others became very delighted upon seeing Chu Feng drinking the cup of tea.

Many among them even stood up and stared at Chu Feng. They were waiting for his embarrassing reaction to the poison.

“Ahh~~~”

However, not only did Chu Feng not behave in the manner that they were hoping to see, but he took a deep and delightful sigh.

“This sure is good tea. This tea had a sweet aftertaste, and was heavily fragrant. It is truly delicious and satisfying. After drinking this tea, I feel that I am much more clear-headed. It seems as if my cultivation has also increased slightly.”

Chu Feng praised the tea nonstop.

“This guy, what sort of nonsense is he spouting?”

Luo Zhi and the others were completely bewildered by Chu Feng’s praises.

They even felt that he was simply spouting rubbish.

That tea was clearly poisoned. Not only would one vomit non stop after drinking the tea, but one would also immediately crap one’s pants and fart uncontrollably.

Unless one had the antidote, this state would last for ten consecutive days.

Furthermore, its aroma was as Song Ge had said and the tea also tasted like water. There was simply no taste to the tea at all.

Thus, why would Chu Feng be praising the tea like it was some sort of sacred tea?

“Asura, how come you’re emitting a faint light?”

“That light is actually growing more and more intense. Not only is the light filled with martial power, but it is also emitting an aroma of tea. Could this be caused by that tea?” Song Ge looked to Chu Feng with a look of surprise.

Song Ge was not the only one surprised; the others were also surprised. The light Chu Feng was emitting from his body was truly extraordinary.

Not only was it filled with concentrated martial power, but it was also emitting an intense tea aroma.

Seeing all this, the crowd were unable to help themselves from associating these things with the tea that Chu Feng had drunk.

“That tea is actually that good?”

At that moment, even Song Ge looked at the pot of tea with curiosity.

She was already filled with a desire to try the tea.

“Of course it’s good tea, come, you should have a cup too," as Chu Feng spoke, he poured a cup of tea for Song Ge.

“Elder Song Ge, you mustn’t drink that tea.”

Seeing that, Luo Zhi and the others rushed to stop her from drinking the tea.

They had prepared a different sort of poisoned tea for her so that they could enjoy her later.

If she were to drink that tea and ended up vomiting and a case of massive diarrhea, how were they supposed to enjoy her?

As such, they would naturally be unwilling to have her drink that tea.

“Why aren’t you allowing Elder Song Ge to drink this cup of tea? Could it be that you think that she is unable to handle it?” Chu Feng asked Luo Zhi and the others.

“That... that is naturally not what we are implying,” Luo Zhi hurriedly explained.

At that moment, Song Ge had received the cup of tea from Chu Feng. She raised both hands and drained it in a single gulp.

“Crap!”

Luo Zhi and the others cried out ‘oh no’ in their hearts upon seeing that Song Ge had really drank the tea.

“This sure is good tea. Never have I ever had tea this tasty.”

“Although I am ignorant of the tea ceremony, this tea is most definitely a treasure among top quality teas.”

To Luo Zhi and the others’ surprise, Song Ge actually also started praising the tea nonstop after drinking it. Following that, she also began to emit the same sort of light as Chu Feng.

“Song Ge, is that tea truly so mystical?” Wang Lian arrived beside Song Ge and asked in a serious manner.

She was still skeptical of Chu Feng. However, she believed Song Ge without any doubt.

“Of course. When have I ever lied to you? Not only is this tea extremely tasty, but it is also able to brighten one’s spirit and increase one’s power.”

“This simply cannot be considered to be tea at all. Instead, it’s a treasured cultivation resource. Wang Lian, you should have a cup,” Song Ge said to Wang Lian.

After hearing what Song Ge said, Wang Lian immediately walked over to the teapot with the intention of tasting the tea.

She did not care what the tea might taste like. However, after Song Ge and Chu Feng said that the tea was able to increase their cultivation, she was very interested in trying it out.

However, right after she approached, and before she could even touch the teapot, Chu Feng grabbed the teapot and lifted it up.

“This teapot is too small. A single pot only holds three cups of tea.”

“There’s one cup left. Attendant, I thank you for preparing such good tea for us. This final cup shall be rewarded to you." Chu Feng poured the final cup of tea and handed it to the attendant.

“This bastard!”

Wang Lian started gnashing her teeth angrily after seeing Chu Feng bestowing the final cup of tea to the attendant, of all people.

After all, she had expressed her desire to drink the tea already. Yet, Chu Feng actually handed the final cup of tea to someone else.

It was clear that he was deliberately not allowing her to drink the final cup of tea.

“Come, attendant. Why are you still standing there? You’re most likely unable to enjoy such good tea normally, no? I’m rewarding you with this cup of tea today, why are you not accepting and drinking it still?”

Holding the cup of tea, Chu Feng walked over to the attendant.

“This... this... this...”

The attendant had a look of fear on his face.

Although Chu Feng and Song Ge appeared to have benefitted from drinking the tea, something that people would yearn to experience for themselves, the attendant knew very well that the tea had been messed with, that it was poisoned, and not some sort of sacred tea.

“What’s this? You’re not willing to drink this tea? Could it be that you’ve poisoned it?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of-of-of course not.” The attendant shook his head repeatedly.

“Then what are you afraid of? Drink it.”

Chu Feng grabbed the attendant, grabbed his mouth and forced the tea down his throat.

At that moment, Luo Zhi and the others were all staring at the attendant.

As matters stood, they were skeptical of whether the tea was poisoned, or if it was some sort of sacred tea.

If the attendant also reacted in the same manner Chu Feng and Song Ge had after drinking the tea, it would definitely be a sacred tea.

If it was a sacred tea, they would naturally not be willing to miss out on it.

As martial cultivators themselves, how could they possibly be willing to miss out on an opportunity to increase their cultivation?

After the attendant was force-fed the tea, he fell powerlessly onto his butt and started crying.

He was extremely worried and afraid, so much so that he did not even manage to catch the flavor of the tea.

At that moment, he felt that he was doomed, and would soon vomit and defecate before the crowd, utterly humiliating himself.

Seeing that the attendant was actually crying, Luo Zhi and the others all shook their heads.

They felt that they’d been deceived, and the tea was not sacred tea at all. Instead, it was poisoned tea.

However, to their surprise, a smile suddenly appeared on that attendant’s tear filled face.

The attendant suddenly stood up and became extremely excited.

At the same time, he also started emitting a tea aroma, and light from his body.

“This tea really has a miraculous effect!”

“Heavens! I feel that the martial power within me has increased by over ten times!”

The attendant was wild with joy. After he stood up, he began to thank Chu Feng repeatedly.

“That tea really has such a miraculous effect?!”

Seeing the reaction of the attendant, the eyes of Luo Zhi and the others immediately started shining.

Originally, they had thought that they were exposed, and Chu Feng was deliberately trying to deceive them.

However, when even the attendant received such a miraculous effect after drinking the tea, it meant that the tea was truly a sacred tea.

“Quickly! Attendant, go and prepare another pot of tea! No, not another pot, bring many pots of tea over!”

“Bring all of them over! Bring as many pots of tea as you have. This great master is going to purchase all this tea from your teahouse!”

Even Luo Zhi was unable to contain himself. He hadn’t even tasted the miraculous tea yet.

“Milord, you want the same tea?” asked the attendant.

“That’s right. I want this tea, I want it exactly the same.” said Luo Zhi.

Although Luo Zhi felt somewhat displeased at failing to humiliate Chu Feng, he had discovered such a miraculous sacred tea by a freak combination of factors. Because of that, he was wild with joy.

Not long afterward, the attendant returned with three pots of tea.

“I said bring as many pots of tea as you have. Why did you only bring over three pots?”

Seeing that the attendant only brought over three pots of tea, Luo Zhi, who was looking forward to enjoying the tea, was immediately displeased.

“Milord, our materials are limited. We only have these three pots of tea.”

The attendant had a look of grievance. He thought to himself, ‘These are poisoned teas, they’re all for poisoning others. Furthermore, a single pot would suffice. Besides, very few people use this tea to poison others. We’re only able to put it to use several times in a year. How could we possibly expect that someone would order so many pots in a single day?’

“Truly useless!”

Luo Zhi walked over furiously.

The attendant walked back in fear. He thought that Luo Zhi was planning to beat him.

However, to his surprise, Luo Zhi did not beat him. Instead, he picked up a teapot and began pouring the tea directly into his mouth

Seeing that there was an insufficient amount of tea, Luo Zhi decided to not share the tea with anyone, and instead drank it all himself.

Seeing Luo Zhi acting like that, two other men immediately rushed forward. Each of them grabbed a pot of tea and started pouring it down their throats.

Those two men were Luo Zhi’s close friends. As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together.

The moral characters of Luo Zhi and his close friends were laid completely bare.

“Hey! Leave some for me! Leave some for me!”

Seeing that Luo Zhi and his two close friends were drinking all the tea in such a manner, the others present started feeling displeased.

They all rushed forward, wanting to drink some tea themselves. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There were even those among them that started fighting for the tea.

Wang Lian was not familiar with them, and thus did not dare to join the scramble. However, her eyes were filled with thirst and desire.

It could be seen that she also wanted to drink that sacred tea.

Seeing those people scrambling over the tea, Chu Feng had a smile on his face.

His smile was one of pure mockery.

The reason for that was because he knew that what they were scrambling over was poisoned tea.

Earlier, Chu Feng had secretly altered the tea with his world spirit techniques. Not only did he remove the poison from within the tea, but he even bestowed the tea with special medicinal properties. That was why the tea had such an unusual effect.

However, the miraculous effect was only there because Chu Feng had altered the tea.

The tea that Luo Zhi and the others drank was the unaltered, poisoned tea.

“Aouu~~~”

Sure enough, not long afterward, Luo Zhi opened his mouth and started spraying out vomit.

Luo Zhi was not the only one who reacted that way. His two close friends also started vomiting.

Seeing that, the confused crowd thought something had happened to Luo Zhi, and immediately rushed out to support him.

They even intended to treat his injuries.

However, soon, a strong stink could be smelled from the three men.

“What sort of smell is that? Why is it so stinky?”

The people that had approached them were all pinching their noses and frowning.

“That’s the smell of feces! Brother Luo Zhi, what’s going on with you all? Why would you decide to publicly defecate?!” Chu Feng shouted as he looked at Luo Zhi and his two close friends.

Fearing that others might not be able to hear him, Chu Feng shouted particularly loudly.

“What? Feces?”

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, the people that were supporting Luo Zhi and the two others immediately dropped them and moved far away.

Someone even set up a spirit formation to seal the three of them and prevent the smell from coming out.

Luo Zhi and his two close friends were feeling extremely wronged.

Not only did they publicly vomit, but they actually even ended up defecating before so many people. Furthermore, they’d shit their pants.

They naturally knew how humiliated they were.

However, due to the effects of the poison, they were unable to even move., they were no longer able to move. It was impossible for them to escape from this situation. They could only continue to vomit and shit their pants before all those people.

At that moment, they were utterly humiliated.
