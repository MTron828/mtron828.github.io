MGA: Chapter 895 - You Are an Outsider

“Go to h...” You Tonghan flew into a rage upon seeing such disrespect toward his master. He pointed at them, preparing to let out a string of curses.

But before he finished speaking, You Mingdeng extended his hand, indicting him to remain silent.

Although You Tonghan felt furious—Xuan Xiaochao and the others also felt furious—since You Mingdeng made a sign for them to remain silent, they naturally didn’t dare to say anything.

Actually, at that moment, You Mingdeng too had quite an unsightly expression, but he didn’t say anything. Instead, after meaningfully looking at those two young men, he waved his big sleeve, and a gale arose, which brought Chu Feng and the others away.

After You Mingdeng left, the rank two Martial King raised his fist slightly, and after three muffled explosions, the three Spirit Formations made by You Mingdeng were easily burst open.

“Thank you for saving us! May I ask for your name? In the future, my Immortal Execution Archipelago will thank you greatly.” At that instant, Murong Xun ignored his own injuries and hurriedly bowed and clasped his hands as an expression of thanks towards those two young men.

“Thanks? What can your Immortal Execution Archipelago give to thank us?” However, absolutely unexpectedly, the two young men did not accept his thanks, and the rank one Martial King even made a mocking smile on his face.

Murong Xun frowned slightly at their reaction, but didn’t say much.

“Eat it. It will ease your Forbidden Medicine’s backlash pain.” The rank two Martial King threw a pellet to the Sixth Immortal.

“This...”

After receiving the pellet, the Sixth Immortal was a bit hesitant because he discovered that the pellet was very odd. There was no medicinal fragrance, and instead, there was a bit of a fetid stench.

It was as though it was made by the blood of humans. Moreover, tiny runes carved on that pellet. Every single one of those runes was very profound. Even though the Sixth Immortal was a Gold-cloak World Spiritist, he did not understand them in any way whatsoever.

The Sixth Immortal was afraid. He didn’t dare to eat it.

“It’s given to you, so eat it. You think my senior will harm you?

“If he did, he could’ve just killed you with a slap. Why go through all this trouble? Eat it.” The rank one Martial King spoke angrily when seeing his hesitation.

The Sixth Immortal was a bit annoyed at those words. He did not know who they were, and even though they did save him, he had no clue whether they were enemy or ally. If he consumed that pellet, thus allowing them control over himself, which then led him to harm the Immortal Execution Archipelago, what could he do then?

However, just at that moment, the rank two Martial King suddenly cast his gaze over.

When he saw those eyes, the Sixth Immortal’s heartbeat sped up. An indescribable fear surged into his heart, and without saying anything more, he swallowed the pellet.

“Return to the Immortal Execution Archipelago. My two seniors are still waiting for you there.” The rank two Martial King only nodded after seeing the Sixth Immortal’s consumption of the pellet. With no rush, he headed towards the Teleportation Array. However, he suddenly stopped, turned his head around, and said indifferently, “Remember. Don’t ask us what our name is. If you want to, you can call us ‘master’.”

After speaking, the man lightly smiled, then continued his way.

As for Murong Xun and the Sixth Immortal, they looked at each other, their faces quite distorted. Even the two Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan had dazed complexions. But, in the end, all of them went in the same direction as the two men.

At the same time, Chu Feng and the others were led by You Mingdeng and brought to a peaceful area.

“Master, I don’t understand. Those two were only a rank one Martial King and a rank two Martial King, but you’re a rank four Martial King! Killing them required no more effort than raising your hand, so why did you need to be afraid of them?” You Tonghan asked with a face full of confusion. His emotions were a bit agitated.

“Insolence!

“Do you speak to your master like this?” However, You Tonghan’s question fetched him You Mingdeng’s berating.

“This disciple doesn’t dare to disrespect Master, but I just don’t understand why they were released in such a manner. They had nearly took our lives!” said You Mingdeng a bit timidly.

“What is the extent of your knowledge? Those two young men were not from the Eastern Sea Region. We cannot afford to offend them,” You Mingdeng said straightforwardly.

“Not from the Eastern Sea Region? Where are they from?” You Tonghan’s face was one of confusion.

“Lord Protector, do you mean those two were from the Holy Land of Martialism?” the Water King asked in a probing manner.

“Their cultivation at such age, their special clothing, their arrogant demeanor, and also their otherworldly aura... They are definitely not from the Eastern Sea Region. Most likely, they’re from the Holy Land of Martialism.” You Mingdeng nodded, his face full of seriousness.

After hearing his words, You Tonghan and the others couldn’t help inhaling deeply. Their complexions became quite odd.

The Holy Land of Martialism—what sort of place was that? They knew very well. It was the cradle of geniuses, the heaven of cultivation experts. It was a place all cultivators wanted to go, and it was even a legend to some.

It was said the natural energy that place contained was many times stronger than the Eastern Sea Region, but similarly, the people from the Eastern Sea Region could not even be compared to the experts at that place.

Yet, right now, in the Eastern Sea Region, someone from the Holy Land of Martialism had appeared, and they even protected their enemy. That made them feel extreme uneasiness. A formless terror had enveloped their hearts.

“Master, putting aside why people from the Holy Land of Martialism have come here, why would they side with the Immortal Execution Archipelago? Why are they helping them?” You Tonghan asked, puzzled.

“That’s the most important piece of this puzzle. Putting aside how they came here, it is a fact that they are here. Moreover, there is a relationship between them and the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It doesn’t matter how they are related to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, but as long as they help them, I’m afraid the war between us and them cannot continue,” You Mingdeng said.

Everyone went silent because they understood what You Mingdeng was trying to say.

“Senior, do you mean we should surrender? Do you think after surrendering, the Immortal Execution Archipelago will forgive us?” Finally, Chu Feng spoke.

But after hearing Chu Feng’s words, You Mingdeng’s complexion twisted. When he looked at Chu Feng, his gaze was also a bit icy. He said with an extremely fierce tone, “Chu Feng, it is already your fortune that I saved you. When we, the Crippling Night Demon Sect, are discussing, can an outsider like you not barge in?”
