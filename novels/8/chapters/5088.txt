Chapter 5088: Making Peace

“He actually managed to do it…”

Sima Xiangtu’s face was ashen. He knew that there was such a possibility, but he still found it hard to accept.

“Are these the Asura Evil Spirits of the Asura Graveyard? Such a powerful army actually submitted to Chu Feng?”

Those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan and the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy looked at Chu Feng in a mixture of awe and fear. They could feel for themselves just how powerful the Asura World Spirit Army was, and they knew what it meant for Chu Feng to become the master of such an army.

Even Wang Yuxian, the Godwish Grandmother, the Lady of Dao Sea, and the others were startled by the sight of the Asura World Spirit Army, let alone the others.

Prince Brightsun, who was hiding inside Sima Xiangtu’s palace, was already scared out of his wits.

“How did it turn out like this? Chu Feng actually made Lord Father and the others submit to him?”

Prince Brightsun felt like someone had clubbed him on the back of his head, causing his mind to go woozy. He could tell that the Asura Evil Spirits had reverted back to Asura World Spirits, and the only way that could have happened was for them to have submitted to Chu Feng.

But Chu Feng was only a junior! He might be talented, but he was just a junior!

Prince Brightsun thought that he was at least on par with Chu Feng, so what rights did the latter have to make the Asura World Spirit Army submit to him?

He couldn’t make sense of it.

Nevertheless, he glanced at Sima Xiangtu and murmured, “I’m sorry, master. I have to at least protect myself.”

He took out a teleportation talisman and crushed it. Spirit power swiftly suffused him, and he was teleported out of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. He was out of Chu Feng’s surveillance area, and the teleportation was done discreetly, such that Chu Feng didn’t notice Prince Brightsun.

Rather, Chu Feng’s eyes were focused on a single person—Sima Xiangtu.

That was a person he definitely couldn’t spare.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh.

Numerous Asura World Spirits made a move at the same time, each of them heading for Sima Xiangtu, Jiang Taibai, Jiang Kongping, Jiang Yuantai, and the key figures of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

In order to ensure that nothing went awry, the strongest Asura King was sent over to deal with Jiang Taibai. Just like that, those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were suppressed.

“That person over there deserves death.”

Chu Feng glanced at the elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. He was the one who had plunged a dagger into the Ox-nosed Old Daoist in order to force Chu Feng to spare Jiang Yuantai.

In fact, if Chu Feng hadn’t been vicious enough to impale Jiang Yuantai’s dantian right away, that elder would have likely killed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and proceeded on with the Godwish Grandmother and the others, judging from the murderous aura he had emanated back then.

That was the moment that Chu Feng placed that elder into his kill list.

An Asura World Spirit was already standing right behind that elder, and it was a person whom Chu Feng was familiar with—Lord Yunliang.

As soon as Chu Feng said those words, Lord Yunliang raised his blade and decapitated that elder.

“You…”

The cultivators of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect immediately responded with outrage, but before they could retaliate, a powerful oppressive might suddenly swept across the area.

Boom!

It was from the Asura King. He was still standing next to Jiang Taibai, but his oppressive might was more than enough to control the situation. He wouldn’t hesitate to decimate anyone who dared to move carelessly within his sphere of control.

That effectively extinguished the anger of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Faced with such absolute force, they had no choice but to reassess the situation.

One, they were in a disadvantageous position and wouldn’t stand a chance in a confrontation at all.

Two, Chu Feng was no timid soul. He wouldn’t hesitate to kill any of them if they dared to pull anything. The elder who was killed without any hesitation just a moment ago was the perfect example.

“Someone is indeed cornered today, but I’m afraid that it isn’t me,” Chu Feng glanced at Jiang Taibai and said.

“Chu Feng, you shouldn’t underestimate us. Young master Yuantai and young master Kongping’s father is our Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s Lord Jingyu. If you dare to mess around, I can tell you that none of your friends will get away scot-free!” Jiang Taibai spat.

It was just that those words didn’t sound so threatening given the situation they were in. Even the members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect weren’t convinced by it, let alone Chu Feng.

Chu Feng burst out into laughter.

“Jiang Taibai, it looks like there’s something wrong with your head. Do you really not know why I’m here today? If not for you attempting to massacre my master and the others, I wouldn’t have to resort to this in the first place,” Chu Feng spat.

“You’re wrong, Chu Feng,” Jiang Kongping suddenly spoke up. “The one who wants to kill your master and the others has always been Sima Xiangtu and not us. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have pleaded on your behalf back when my older brother tried to kill you.

“Our Pill Dao Immortal Sect had only helped Sima Xiangtu due to a promise we have made. Similarly, if we had been in a partnership with you, Chu Feng, instead, we would have unconditionally helped you deal with your enemies regardless of whether we had a grudge against them or not. These are the principles that our sect abides by,” Jiang Kongping said.

“I won’t deny your principles or your stance, but they don’t make a difference to me. From my perspective, all of you deserve death,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re right. We chose to become your enemy by helping Sima Xiangtu. However, Chu Feng, you have also killed an elder of our Pill Dao Immortal Sect. I believe that makes things equal between us. Besides, just like what Jiang Taibai said, if you massacre all of us today, my father won’t let you off. You might be able to escape, but will the others be able to do the same?

“That’s why I would like to make a proposal. Why don’t we just call it quits here and bury the hatchet? Let’s not cross paths ever again in the future,” Jiang Kongping said.

“Can I take your word for it? I think that you’re a trustworthy person, Jiang Kongping, but I don’t trust your older brother, your father, and anyone else in your Pill Dao Immortal Sect,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, if you spare us today, I guarantee that our Pill Dao Immortal Sect won’t make things difficult for you,” Jiang Kongping said.

Chu Feng fell silent upon hearing those words.

He had no doubt that Jiang Kongping’s father would indeed exact vengeance on him if he massacred Jiang Kongping and the others here today. Besides, it was a fact that Jiang Kongping had saved his life. He could kill everyone else without any hesitation, but his principles wouldn’t allow him to do the same to Jiang Kongping.

After weighing the pros and cons, Chu Feng eventually came to a decision.

“Jiang Kongping, are you able to speak on behalf of everyone in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?”

Chu Feng shot a glance at Jiang Yuantai and Jiang Taibai as he said those words.

Jiang Kongping lifted his hand up, revealing a glowing golden token. Inscribed on the token was the anime ‘Jingyu’.

“Members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, tell Chu Feng whether my words count or not!” Jiang Kongping roared.

His question was answered by deafening voices.

“We’ll listen to young master Kongping’s orders!”

That was the response from the million cultivators of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

“Very well, Jiang Kongping. I’ll spare everyone on your account. Let’s call it quits and bury the hatchet. If you can uphold your promise, I won’t hold this matter against the Pill Dao Immortal Sect anymore. However, I want to make it clear that if you dare go after me or my friends, I’ll make sure that you pay the price,” Chu Feng said.

“Brother Chu Feng, you can rest assured. If any of my men dare to make a move against you and your friends, I’ll execute him myself. If I am unable to do so, you’re free to take my life,” Jiang Kongping said.

“Sounds good to me. Let’s settle things with that then. However, I definitely cannot spare that person over there.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Chu Feng turned his sights toward Sima Xiangtu.

“Lord Taibai, young master Kongping, s-save me! Save me!”

Sima Xiangtu anxiously pleaded with Jiang Taibai and Jiang Kongping. Jiang Taibai turned to look at Jiang Kongping, a gesture indicating that he would listen to Jiang Kongping’s order on this matter.

“Brother Chu Feng, if you don’t mind, I’d like to say something about Sima Xiangtu,” Jiang Kongping said.

Chu Feng frowned upon hearing those words.

“If you’re going to plead on his behalf, don’t bother,” he said with a cold voice.

His intent was clear. He wouldn’t spare Sima Xiangtu regardless of what anyone else said.

Jiang Kongping chuckled softly and said, “Sima Xiangtu is an utterly repulsive excuse of a human being. I’m ashamed that our Pill Dao Immortal Sect had to work with someone like that. Since our values diverge, there’s no reason for us to continue our partnership. I hereby declare that the partnership between our Pill Dao Immortal Sect and Sima Xiangtu is severed!

“Brother Chu Feng, as a show of sincerity, I’m more than willing to deal with that old scoundrel Sima however you want to on your behalf,” Jiang Kongping said.

He drew his weapon and began walking toward Sima Xiangtu.

This outright betrayal left Sima Xiangtu completely stunned.
