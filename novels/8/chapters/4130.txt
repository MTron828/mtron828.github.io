Chapter 4130 - Cannot Stay

“Why should we tell you where we’re from and what our names are?”

“What’s this? Could you be planning to eradicate us and kill our families too?” sneered Fumo Shaoyu.

Even though the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s attitude was very good, he responded with a very bad attitude.

“Young friend, my son is stubborn and mischievous.”

“I know that it must be my son who was in the wrong, and offended you all.”

“Rest assured. I will punish him severely, and return justice to you all,” said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Oh?”

“If you’re planning to return justice to us, then it would not only be teaching your son a lesson,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Young friend, please go ahead and tell me what you want then,” said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“You must be the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, right?” asked Fumo Shaoyu.

“I am indeed the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief,” said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“That’s good then. I can disregard the matter of your son kidnapping my lil sis.”

“However, you must provide us with an explanation about the matter regarding your Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen stealing the treasure from my brother and I,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“My Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansman stealing your treasure?”

“May I know who did that?” asked the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I seem to recall his name was Zuoqiu Hanxun.”

“He stole a lightning pearl my brother and I found.”

“That lightning pearl is a cultivation treasure that’s of enormous use to my brother,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“That lightning pearl was actually yours?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief felt very surprised to hear those words.

He’d had no idea that that lightning pearl was something Zuoqiu Hanxun had snatched from someone else.

“It would appear that you know of the lightning pearl,” Fumo Shaoyu narrowed his brows. The displeasure on his face grew even more intense.

“I do know of the lightning pearl. However, I had no idea that it was something Elder Hanxun had plundered from you all.”

“How about this: young friend, please follow me back.”

“If what you all say is the truth, I will definitely settle things for you,” said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Let’s forget about it. It’s nothing major. Let’s just drop it,” said Chu Feng.

He did not wish to continue to tangle with the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, and wanted to quickly leave this place.

“Forget about it?”

“How could we possibly forget about it? That treasure belonged to us.”

“They must provide us with an explanation,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Young friend, please rest assured. My Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan is not an unreasonable clan. If really is my clansman that was in the wrong, I will definitely provide you all with a justification,” said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. His attitude was extremely cordial.

With the situation being like that, it was unsuitable for Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings to refuse him.

Besides, Fumo Shaoyu was determined to get an explanation.

As such, they followed the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.

As soon as they returned to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation they caught sight of Zuoqiu Hanxun again.

Zuoqiu Hanxun was rather surprised to see Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu.

Upon learning what had happened, he became even more surprised.

What had happened between them could be described with a single phrase -- enemies running into each other on a narrow road!

That said, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief turned out to really be a reasonable person.

Upon confirming that Zuoqiu Hanxun’s lightning pearl had indeed been plundered from Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu, he immediately had Zuoqiu Hanxun apologize to them.

Although Zuoqiu Hanxun was very unwilling, he didn’t dare oppose his Lord Clan Chief, and really ended up apologizing to Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu.

That said, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not plan to return the lightning pearl to Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because he needed it to activate the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.

Activating the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation required a lot of natural treasures. Of those treasures, the most important ones would be those related to Heavenly Bloodlines.

The lightning pearl would be crucial to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.

Because of that, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief proposed something else instead.

He proposed to have Chu Feng enter the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation with Zuoqiu Tiancheng so that they could enjoy the power of the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation together.

Fumo Shaoyu felt that this proposal was fair.

Because of that, they agreed on it.

After they came to a decision, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief ordered his men to treat Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings as distinguished guests, and set up arrangements for them in the temporary palaces.

After Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings left, the others also left in succession.

With that, only the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Zuoqiu Hanxun remained in the palace.

Finally, Zuoqiu Hanxun voiced his confusion.

“Lord Clan Chief, we’ve prepared for the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation for so long.”

“Even if that lightning pearl is of considerable value, it’s actually not that important.”

“If we’re worried about their origin, we might as well return the lightning pearl to them.”

“Are you really planning to have him enter the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation together with young master?”

“Could it be that that child’s origin is so great and his backing is so powerful that even our Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan would have to curry favor with him?” asked Zuoqiu Hanxun.

“Those three people of the younger generation all possess extraordinary talent.”

“However, I suspect that their origins are not that powerful. Likely, they’re geniuses from certain minor powers.”

“Otherwise, they wouldn’t have refused to mention what power they belonged to,” said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“If that’s the case, then this subordinate is even more confused,” Zuoqiu Hanxun had a confused look on his face.

The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not answer directly. Instead, he smiled with complacence before saying, “Elder Hanxun, there’s no need to bother choosing a Lightning Guide from the clan.”

“Lord Clan Chief, could it be...” Zuoqiu Hanxun’s expression changed enormously upon hearing those words.

Then, a sinister smile replaced the puzzled look on his face.

“Lord Clan Chief is truly brilliant,” Zuoqiu Hanxun bowed to the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Zuoqiu Hanxun had realized what their Lord Clan Chief intended to do.

However, soon, a trace of hesitation appeared on his smile-filled face.

“Lord Clan Chief, with how exceptionally talented those three youngsters are, especially that Chu Feng, who’s not only a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist possessing the Dragon Transformation Sensation, but also someone who triggered nine colored lightning on the Bloodline Testing Stone, a sign that his talent is extremely terrifying; they are rare geniuses in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.”

“Would geniuses like them, especially that Chu Feng, be from minor powers?”

“What if that Chu Feng is from some colossal power? If that’s the case and we end up using him as the Lightning Guide...”

“Wouldn’t that mean that we’ll have brought a major disaster upon ourselves?”

It turned out that Zuoqiu Hanxun’s hesitation was not about whether or not Chu Feng would live, but whether or not he had a major power backing him.

He was afraid that they’d end up courting unnecessary troubles.

“Rest assured. My eyesight is extremely accurate. That sort of possibility is practically nonexistent,” the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said with a look of confidence.

After hearing his Lord Clan Chief put it like that, Zuoqiu Hanxun’s worries eased considerably.

He believed in his Lord Clan Chief’s judgement.

.........

Whilst Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings had lodgings arranged for them by the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, they were not separated.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had something to say to the Fumo siblings.

“We cannot stay in this place. We must leave at once,” said Chu Feng.
