Chapter 5735: A Fight Between Prodigies

The two of them unleashed the full prowess of their cultivation and auras.

Both their cultivation levels were locked at rank one Half-God level, and their fighting prowess was equal as well. The only differentiating factor was their skills and combat experience.

“I’ll be disappointed if you hold back, Brother Chu Feng,” Zhang Yingxiong said.

“It’s the same for me too,” Chu Feng said.

“Don’t worry, I’ll go all out. It symbolizes my respect for you.”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Zhang Yingxiong’s faint smile abruptly faded, as his eyes turned cold. With a flash of light, he instantaneously arrived before Chu Feng and plunged his wooden sword toward Chu Feng’s heart.

However, he hurriedly changed his sword trajectory to knock aside Chu Feng’s wooden sword instead, as he realized that Chu Feng’s wooden sword was aimed at his heart too. He would be a goner even if he succeeded at stabbing Chu Feng if he didn’t defend himself.

However, Chu Feng abruptly changed his footing, as his sword glided toward Zhang Yingxiong’s neck.

Taken aback by Chu Feng’s aggression, Zhang Yingxiong tried to back off from the battle so as to regain his momentum, but Chu Feng sensed his intention and quickly followed up, not giving him room to recover at all.

Seeing that he was cornered, Zhang Yingxiong burst into laughter and said, “Hahaha! Exhilarating! As expected of Brother Chu Feng!”

Seeing how Chu Feng refused to give him any space to recover, Zhang Yingxiong decided to abandon his defense and go on the offense instead. He plunged his sword forward with imposing might, pushing his strength and speed to its limit.

Chu Feng could tell from this sudden change of swordsmanship that Zhang Yingxiong had gotten serious. This attack was so forceful that Chu Feng was reluctant to directly confront it. Instead, he chose to retract his sword and deflect the attack.

However, Zhang Yingxiong didn’t give Chu Feng any chance to counterattack. He raised his sword and hacked down again and again, sending a flurry of blows toward Chu Feng. These blows were so powerful that they would be fatal if they landed.

In the blink of an eye, Chu Feng lost control over the momentum of the battle, but that only got Chu Feng even more excited. He had been wanting to fight with a powerful enemy.

As powerful as Zhang Yingxiong’s attacks were, Chu Feng was able to block all of them and emerged unscathed.

Zhang Yingxiong was surprised, for he knew that his swordsmanship was passed down from the Immemorial Era. Every single move required an extreme level of skill to pull off, such that ordinary prodigies would struggle to grasp even one even if they dedicated their life to it.

In fact, executing the swordsmanship still took a huge toll on him even though he had fully grasped it. It wasn’t much of a problem to him though, as he would always be able to quickly defeat his opponent once he employed it.

Yet, Chu Feng was able to cope as if he could see through Zhang Yingxiong’s attacks. In fact, there were times when Zhang Yingxiong hadn’t even fully unleashed his move yet, but Chu Feng had already pre-emptively moved his sword in defense.

“He’s able to predict my moves?”

Zhang Yingxiong quickly realized that Chu Feng was predicting his next move, or else there was no way he could have defended against his furious flurry of attacks so easily. As such, he decided to change his flow to disrupt Chu Feng’s momentum.

“Damn!”

As soon as Zhang Yingxiong changed his flow, Chu Feng abandoned defense and went on the assault, thrusting his sword forth. Zhang Yingxiong was barely able to dodge it, but Chu Feng unhesitatingly followed up with a series of deadly attacks that rendered the other party unable to do anything but defend.

As a result, Zhang Yingxiong found himself pushed back again and again.

“How did it end up like this? Did he predict I would change my flow? Was he waiting for the moment I showed an opening when I changed my flow to counterattack?”

Had it been anyone else, Zhang Yingxiong would have thought it was just a coincidence, but Chu Feng’s offense was so tight that it was clearly premeditated. It was not just luck.

“I underestimated Chu Feng.”

Zhang Yingxiong racked his brain for a solution to defeat Chu Feng.

While Chu Feng had grasped the flow of the battle, he knew it wasn’t over yet from how Zhang Yingxiong was blocking all of his attacks. At the same time, he noticed the way Zhang Yingxiong defended himself was very different from his.

Chu Feng had relied on his sharp judgment and battle sense to deal with Zhang Yingxiong’s offense, which allowed him to predict how the latter would attack.

On the other hand, Zhang Yingxiong relied on an ingenious defensive swordsmanship that combined both offense and defense. With this, he could deal with any attack that came in his direction as long as he didn’t slip up.

Chu Feng had never seen anything as ingenious as this before, to the extent that he struggled to imitate it even with his sharp discernment. This made him realize once more that it wouldn’t be easy for him to triumph over Zhang Yingxiong.

…

A man carrying an ax on his back was standing in the middle of vast space, just outside the Pulse Ignition Realm’s atmosphere. He was Song Changsheng.

Song Changsheng was looking in Chu Feng and Zhang Yingxiong’s direction, a sign that their concealment wasn’t enough to deceive him.

“I’d have never thought there is a junior out there who could fight on par with Chu Feng,” Song Changsheng was so surprised that he exclaimed aloud.

“Are you feeling old now?” an elderly voice echoed behind.

Song Changsheng turned around and bowed with a smile, “Elder.”

The person who had spoken earlier was none other than Zhang Yingxiong’s master.

Zhang Yingxiong’s master waved his hand with a smile and replied, “You may spare with the formalities.”

“It has been a long time since we last met. I didn’t think you would be drawn to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Song Changsheng remarked with a surprisingly respectful tone that was unlike his usual cold demeanor.

“I came here with my disciple,” Zhang Yingxiong’s master replied.

“Your disciple?” Song Changsheng immediately put the two and two together. “Is he your disciple?”

“Yes, the one fighting Chu Feng is my disciple.”

“Ah! No wonder, no wonder.”

That clarified Song Changsheng’s doubts regarding Zhang Yingxiong’s strength.

Zhang Yingxiong’s master chuckled softly before asking, “Have you not gained full control of the Soul Fog yet?”

“I’m afraid not,” Song Changsheng replied lamentably.

“It’s only a matter of time with your talent. I came here today because there’s something I need to discuss with you,” Zhang Yingxiong’s master said.

“It’s thanks to elder that I am what I am today. I’ll never forget your grace. Please feel free to ask anything of me. I’ll accomplish it to the best of my ability,” Song Changsheng replied.
