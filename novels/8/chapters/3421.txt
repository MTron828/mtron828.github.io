Chapter 3421 - Person Who Breached The Formation

“True Dragon World Spiritist?” Hearing those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s expression became complicated. His expression appeared to be one deep contemplation. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

It was not only Grandmaster Liangqiu. Both Liangqiu Chengfeng and Wuming Xingyun reacted in the same manner as Grandmaster Liangqiu. They began to reflect upon Grandmaster Long Xuan’s words.

After a good while, Grandmaster Liangqiu suddenly sighed. “In that case, it would appear that even though we’ve trained for so long and believed that we were standing at the apex, we are actually... only seeing the tip of the iceberg, and are still far away from the actual apex.”

“Oh my, Grandmaster Liangqiu, did you all really believe his nonsense? Don’t you all know who that Long Xuan is?”

“He’s just like that Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Apart from boasting, he knows nothing else. I truly wonder how someone like him managed to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist,” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.

Hearing what the Queen Mother Fox Immortal said, both Liangqiu Chengfeng and Wuming Xingyun felt her words to make a lot of sense.

Thinking about the things that Grandmaster Long Xuan had done in the past, he was indeed very unreliable. However, they were unable to make themselves distrust his words completely. As such, they still doubted somewhat.

However, Grandmaster Liangqiu was still pondering with twinkling eyes.

“Long Xuan, where did you learn those things?” Grandmaster Liangqiu asked.

“A senior mentioned it to me. However, I am unable to reveal that senior’s name,” Grandmaster Long Xuan said.

“Grandmaster, you should stop bothering to ask him about it anymore. He’s lying to you. In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, you are the one with the highest level of achievements in terms of world spirit techniques. Yet, not even you know about those things. Thus, how could he possibly know about it?” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.

“Old Granny Fox Immortal, I’ll tell you this: in this world, there are people more talented than oneself. Although the Ancestral Martial Starfield controls many worlds, it’s simply unworthy of even being compared to the formidable major powers of the vast and boundless world of martial cultivators,” Grandmaster Long Xuan said.

“Aiyoh, you think you’re the only one who knows that? I also know about the vast and boundless martial cultivation world. However, which of us have ever seen it?”

“Not to mention the Martial Gods and True Gods, have you ever met a Half God-level cultivator? Wait... you...” Suddenly, Queen Mother Fox Immortal seemed to recall something. Then, her expression changed enormously. She suddenly shouted explosively and with great fury, “Who were you calling Old Granny?!!!!!!”

After shouting those words, Queen Mother Fox Immortal unleashed her oppressive might that swept toward Grandmaster Long Xuan. She was really planning to fight him.

“Rumble~~~”

However, right at the moment when her oppressive might was heard, a loud explosion sounded from afar.

Accompanying the loud explosion, the ground started to tremble violently. Even Queen Mother Fox Immortal and the others were nearly unable to stand firm.

At that moment, the five looked to one another. Simultaneously, they said, “It’s from the direction of the grand formation.”

The loud explosion did come from the grand formation...

Currently, the majestic grand formation set up by the World Spiritist Immortal King was shattering and crumbling.

“What’s going on? Could it be... the grand formation has been breached?”

As the people of the younger generation gathered outside the grand formation saw the shattering pieces of the spirit formation, astonishment filled their faces.

The reason for that was because the scene before them was no longer only spectacular, but it was shocking to their very hearts.

That grand formation was set up by the World Spiritist Immortal King. Till that moment, no one had been able to breach it.

However, at that moment, it had started to collapse. What did it mean?

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

At that moment, five figures flew over. It was Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others.

“Grandmaster, what is going on?”

Upon seeing the five, Tang Zhenghao and the other people of the younger generation immediately stepped forth to question them.

“The grand formation has likely been breached,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“Ah? It really is caused by the grand formation being breached?” The people of the younger generation actually already had that guess in their minds. Upon hearing Grandmaster Liangqiu’s words, their guess was verified.

Merely, the answer was simply too astonishing.

Could such a powerful grand formation really be breached because of them, people of the younger generation?

At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others raised their heads and looked to the sky.

Seeing that, the people of the younger generation also raised their heads and looked to the sky.

The grand formation was still crumbling. However, that gown was still floating in midair. It showed no signs of descending.

“Haha, with the grand formation breached, that Nine Dragons Saint Cloak shall be this Queen Mother’s,” suddenly, a figure soared into the sky. It was Queen Mother Fox Immortal.

“That damned woman actually rushed out first!” Grandmaster Long Xuan cursed in rage upon seeing that. He immediately soared into the sky and rushed after Queen Mother Fox Immortal.

However, he was still a moment too late. At their level, even though the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was very far away, it was a distance that they could reach in an instant.

Queen Mother Fox Immortal had seized the opportunity and arrived before the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak first.

“Haha, treasure, you’re mine now.”

Queen Mother Fox Immortal was wild with joy. Even her laughter became somewhat sinister. As she laughed with joy, she extended her hand toward the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

“Zzzzz~~~”

However, when Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s hand came in contact with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak suddenly started to shine. As for Queen Mother Fox Immortal, she let out a scream, and immediately distanced herself from the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

Seeing that, Grandmaster Long Xuan immediately halted. He questioned, “Old Granny Fox Immortal, what happened?”

“Damn it. Even though the grand formation has been breached, the formation guarding the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak still exists,” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said as she grabbed the hand that she had used to touch the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak earlier.

At that moment, everyone could see that Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s hand was actually charred black.

That was not an ordinary burn. If it were an ordinary burn, a world spiritist like Queen Mother Fox Immortal couldn’t possibly be in such pain, or be unable to treat the wound.

“Let me have a look,” Grandmaster Liangqiu arrived beside Queen Mother Fox Immortal and began to treat her injury.

“Heavens! Isn’t that Dragon Mark?!”

“Heavens! Grandmaster Liangqiu is already a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?”

“This is great, this is truly great. Our Ancestral Martial Starfield finally possesses a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist!!!”

After Grandmaster Liangqiu unleashed his spirit power, the people of the younger generation finally noticed that Grandmaster Liangqiu’s spirit power had dragon veined patterns flowing through it.

At that moment, the crowd were all overjoyed. Some among them even began to congratulate Grandmaster Liangqiu.

After all, there were no Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield before. To the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, this was a happy occasion.

Grandmaster Liangqiu would naturally not bother to pay attention to those people of the younger generation. Instead, he continued to focus on treating Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s injury.

Even though he was already a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, that injury was still very difficult to treat. He could only bring relief for the pain, and could not help Queen Mother Fox Immortal recover completely in a short period of time.

“Grandmaster, it would appear that World Spiritist Immortal King was truly a legendary God-cloak World Spiritist. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be injured to such a state,” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.

“Indeed. It would appear that an extraordinarily grand individual came to our Ancestral Martial Starfield in the past,” Grandmaster Liangqiu smiled.

“Grandmaster, the grand formation has been breached, why is the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak’s defensive formation still present?” Queen Mother Fox Immortal asked.

“That’s very simple. The person who breached the grand formation wasn’t you,” Grandmaster Long Xuan said.

Queen Mother Fox Immortal cast a glare at Grandmaster Long Xuan. Then, she looked back to Grandmaster Liangqiu, who was treating her injury, “Grandmaster, why don’t you give it a try?”

However, Grandmaster Liangqiu shook his head, “This old man wouldn’t do.”

“Who would then?” Queen Mother Fox Immortal asked.

Grandmaster Liangqiu didn’t say anything. Instead, he looked below.

He was looking to the place where Chu Feng and the others had entered.
