Chapter 5916: The Sun and the Moon Sharing the Sky, the Land of Phenomenon

It was thanks to Tan Yu’s grandfather that they had been able to stand their ground in this realm. They weren’t particularly powerful or anything, but they were at least able to live a peaceful life.

Later, after Tan Yu’s grandfather succumbed to an illness, their family unwittingly revealed their vast wealth, causing greedy outsiders to go after them. Their family suffered disastrous losses due to that, and Tan Yu’s parents died from the grievous injuries they sustained.

Tan Yu, who was only 10 years old then, shouldn’t have survived the ordeal.

Fortunately, an elder of the Sunmoon Sect happened to pass by the area. He drove away the invaders and brought him and his 5-year-old little sister to the Sunmoon Sect.

Tan Yu and his little sister displayed astounding talent in the Sunmoon Sect. It didn’t take them long to become the most outstanding disciples there.

213 years ago, Tan Yu’s bloodline awakened, inducing a huge phenomenon that alarmed the entire realm.

That should have brought Tan Yu to a greater height, but instead, it brought a calamity upon him.

The strongest disciple in the Sunmoon Sect then was the grandson of the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster. Fearing that Tan Yu would overtake him, he colluded with his little sister to drug him and dig out his dantian.

“Wait. Is the little sister you speak of your little sister or the little sister of the sectmaster’s grandson?” Zi Ling asked.

“It’s my little sister. She joined the Sunmoon Sect with me and displayed outstanding talent too. She was betrothed to the grandson of the Sunmoon Sect’s sectmaster. I thought this marriage would reinforce our positions in the Sunmoon Sect, but ever since my little sister married over, the cultivation resources I received began decreasing instead.

“My little sister married during a crucial phase of my cultivation, and I made an outstanding contribution to the sect around the same time, so the sect should have increased my cultivation resources. However, my cultivation resources decreased instead. It was only then that I realized that the sectmaster’s grandson might have felt threatened by me.

“The further decrease in my cultivation resources after I awakened my bloodline verified my conjecture. Thus, I made up my mind to secretly leave the Sunmoon Sect. I only told my little sister about that matter, fearing that she might be implicated in my departure. However, I only sensed the Sunmoon Sect’s schemes but not my little sister’s changes.

“She was afraid that her standing would be affected by my departure, so she drugged me and informed her husband about this. By the time I woke up, I already had my dantian dug out and was branded a traitor who stole the Sunmoon Sect’s treasure.”

At this point, Tan Yu bitterly shook his head.

This matter was a huge blow to him. Even two hundred years wasn’t enough for him to walk out of that trauma.

“I only survived because my little sister pleaded for my mercy, but thinking back, it might have been because they wanted me to live in agony. My little sister and I were from a small household, and our family members were dead. We had no background, and now I have lost my cultivation too. There was no way I could pose a threat to them. I was laughing fodder for them.

“Betrayed by my little sister, losing my cultivation, and being constantly plagued by pain, I didn’t want to live on anymore. Thus, I headed to my parents’ grave, wanting to end it once and for all. That was where I met Elder Zhao, who was paying respect to my grandfather’s grave.

“Elder Zhao was sympathetic to my plight, so he gave me some resources and consoled me, saying that there’ll only be hope if I live on, and everything will end the moment I die. He settled me down in this place,” Tan Yu said.

“Did Zhao Pei pay you a visit since?” Zi Ling asked.

“He didn’t.” Tan Yu shook his head.

“He could have done more to help you,” Zi Ling said with a sigh.

“Zhao Pei is not a courageous person, and the Sunmoon Sect is a behemoth in his eyes. He has already done a lot by helping Tan Yu settle down here,” Chu Feng said.

He had seen plenty of cowards in his life, and he thought that it was decent that Zhao Pei had done this much for Tan Yu.

“I would have been dead if not for Elder Zhao. I am thankful to him,” Tan Yu replied.

Zhao Pei could have naturally done more, but Tan Yu understood that Zhao Pei wasn’t obliged to offer him any help. He was grateful for whatever he had received.

And that was what Chu Feng liked about Tan Yu.

Just because a person was stronger didn’t mean that they were obliged to help the weak. Such an attitude bred self-entitlement. All help, regardless of big or small, should be considered a favor. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“How do you intend to deal with your little sister?” Chu Feng asked.

“She’s my little sister, after all. I don’t hope for her death,” Tan Yu replied.

“Understood. Lead the way,” Chu Feng instructed.

Under Tan Yu’s guidance, the group soon arrived at the Sunmoon Sect’s territory, which was located amid a vast plain. Before the Sunmoon Sect came into sight, Chu Feng suddenly halted his footsteps to warily scan the area. He even took out his Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

“Big brother Chu Feng, is the Sunmoon Sect stronger than Tan Yu claims?” Zi Ling asked via voice transmission, thinking there must be a reason behind Chu Feng’s wariness.

“I don’t sense any formidable powers, but this place is rather peculiar,” Chu Feng replied.

“Peculiar? How so?” Zi Ling asked.

“I can’t put my finger on it either, but it gives me a rather uncanny feeling,” Chu Feng replied as he continued examining the area.

He had been to many places, but rarely did a place induce such a feeling of attraction in him. His confusion only deepened as he surveyed the area, but at the same time, the attraction he felt grew stronger.

“Tan Yu, what do you know about this place?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know the name of this plain. It was said to be a barren place till the founder of the Sunmoon Sect passed by this area and coincidentally witnessed a grand phenomenon of the sun and the moon sharing the sky. He thought that there must be something special about this place, so he founded the sect here.”

Those words verified Chu Feng’s conjecture that there was something special about this place. Why would there be a phenomenon in an ordinary place?

Thus, Chu Feng continued surveying the area.

“This phenomenon has happened several times more, according to the Sunmoon Sect’s records, but I have never witnessed it in person.”

“Is this a blessed land? Could there be a treasure hidden here?” Zi Ling asked.
