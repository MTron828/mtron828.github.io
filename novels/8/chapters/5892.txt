Chapter 5893: The Sacred Mountain Temple’s Silhouette

“Based on what I have observed, there are a few conditions that need to be met to enter the Sacred Temple. One of them is that we can only select one formation to breach. I’m guessing that there’s a condition on the formation too; we can’t randomly pick one,” Chu Feng said.

“How did you figure that out?” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

Sansheng Qiutian and Sansheng Xingyu stared at Chu Feng in curiosity too.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan had always believed that whether one was allowed to enter the Sacred Temple depended on the amount of sacred mountain’s energy one collected.

Chu Feng’s theory defied what they believed.

“I have been observing the arrangements of the forests, the changes in the stairs, the fluctuations in the energy, and so on. All of them contain hints,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you serious? That’s too obscure! I am a world spiritist too, but I have never heard of anyone making such observations to decipher a formation,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“It has nothing to do with being a world spiritist. Cultivators can gather as much by observing them normally too. Of course, it’s just a deduction on my part, so whether my observation is accurate or not awaits further confirmation,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah, so it’s just a deduction,” Sansheng Qiutian murmured.

They thought that Chu Feng’s deduction was a bit too far-fetched. The only one who really trusted Chu Feng was Zi Ling, even though Chu Feng had already proved his sharp observation through the token.

They continued advancing.

It came to a point where even Chu Feng felt pressured, but it was within the range of what he could take. At the very least, he was much more relaxed compared to the others.

While walking, Chu Feng’s eyes suddenly lit up.

Another spirit formation gate that was over ninety meters tall appeared ahead of them, just beside the stairs. There was a stone monument erected in front of the spirit formation gate. Inscribed on the monument were two names—the first one was Sansheng Qiankun, and the second one was Chu Xuanyuan.

“Cough cough... All right, all right. This is the formation where I had an intense competition with your father. Other formations require cooperation, but this one is a competition. It was the first time I saw another side to your father—he’s truly strong. It was an exhilarating fight, but I won by a close shave,” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief proudly recounted the story.

“Ah! This is the formation where our fathers had an intense showdown back then. The other formations require cooperation, but this one is a competition.

“Elder Clan Chief, what’s your current cultivation level?” Chu Feng asked.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief paused. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, “What do you think?”

“Heavenly God level,” Chu Feng replied.

“Sometimes, it’s good to maintain an air of mystery,” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief replied before advancing on.

Sansheng Qiutian secretly sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng, “My father and Elder Sheng’s cultivation levels are a mystery to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan. The two of them don’t even know each other’s cultivation level.”

He was telling Chu Feng that his father hid his cultivation from everyone, not just Chu Feng. Chu Feng hadn’t expected the doltish Sansheng Qiutian to have such a meticulous side.

As the group advanced, the pressure intensified. Everyone, except Chu Feng, started huffing and puffing, including the clan chief.

“Chu Feng, are you not tired?” The clan chief looked at Chu Feng with a perplexed frown, as if he was looking at a monster.

Chu Feng’s existence put him in an awkward position. He should have been the most relaxed person in the group, but Chu Feng was outperforming him here.

“I’m tired, but it’s bearable,” Chu Feng replied.

“It looks like you have inherited your father’s constitution. He’s also pretty thick-skinned,” the clan chief said.

“Did Elder Chu Xuanyuan stroll through the sacred mountain with ease too? Father, that’s not what you said back then. You told me you fared much better than Elder Chu Xuanyuan up here!” Sansheng Qiutian exclaimed.

“Cough cough! Nonsense, I have never said that,” the clan chief awkwardly replied.

“Why aren’t you admitting to it?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“You must be so exhausted that your memories are all jumbled up,” the clan chief said.

Sansheng Qiutian was indeed in a bad condition. Not only was he huffing and puffing, but his face had turned so pale that he almost looked like a corpse.

“Do you want to take a rest?” Sansheng Xingyu asked.

Before the clan chief could reply, Chu Feng interjected, “We can’t rest. We need to complete this in a single shot.”

“How do you know that?” the clan chief asked in surprise.

“Observation,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Can you really discern that much?” The clan chief found it hard to believe.

Much of what their Three Saints Monstrous Clan knew was built on their predecessors’ experience, but Chu Feng was able to discern so much without any prior experience. This was baffling to the clan chief.

The group continued marching ahead. The journey did get tougher, but they clenched their teeth and held on. Eventually, they arrived at the peak of the sacred mountain.

Three statues of over ten thousand meters tall stood at the sacred mountain’s peak. The two statues by the sides looked to be from Sansheng Qiutian’s and Elder Sheng’s clans, whereas the center one looked like a human.

The center one had human hair and wore human clothes and human shoes. The only feature he had that indicated that he was a monstrous beast was his third eye.

Beneath the three statues were two spirit formation gates. The one on the left was closed, whereas the one on the right was open.

The height of the spirit formation gate had been increasing as they journeyed up the sacred mountain. The taller the spirit formation gate, the more difficult the formation was.

Even so, the tallest spirit formation gate they had seen before this was less than a hundred meters tall. Yet, these two spirit formation gates were over a thousand meters in height. It was a warning to challengers that these two formations’ difficulty was unmatched by those before.

A stone monument stood in front of the two spirit formation gates. There were only three words inscribed on the stone monument—Proceed with caution.

“Are these the ancestors of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan who received the title of Monstrous Sage?” Zi Ling asked out of curiosity.

“Indeed,” the clan chief replied before turning to Sansheng Qiutian.

Sansheng Qiutian had exerted himself so much that he was now sprawled on the ground, too weak to even stand on his feet. Fortunately, his condition was improving. The pressure that had weighed on them while they were journeying up the sacred mountain had vanished as soon as they reached the mountain peak.

“My son, hurry up and thank Chu Feng. You wouldn’t have gotten here if not for him.”

The clan chief didn’t blame his son for faring the worst in the group; instead, he looked pained to see his son in such a poor condition.

“Hehe! Chu Feng, pass your hundred high-tier pills to me. I’ll let you pick whatever you want from me in exchange.” Sansheng Qiutian was so feeble that his voice was barely audible, but he had a wide grin on his face.

It was not his first time scaling the sacred mountain, but it was his first time reaching the peak. It was thanks to Chu Feng that he was able to get this far.

“All right.” Chu Feng nodded with a smile. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He had no use for the high-tier pills anyway, so he wanted to trade it for other treasures.

He initially looked at the three statues, but he soon turned his gaze behind the statues. “Elder, is that silhouette over there the Sacred Temple?”

The clan chief was stunned. “You can see our Sacred Temple?”
