Chapter 3093 - Regarding Mother

"The Galaxy that our Ancestral Martial Starfield belongs to is called the Holy Light Galaxy."

"Actually, in the earliest days of the Holy Light Galaxy, it was known as the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. The reason why it is called the Holy Light Galaxy now is because the ruler of the Holy Light Galaxy is the Holy Light Clan."

"As the overlord of a galaxy, the Holy Light Clan has the authority to change the name of the galaxy they rule over."

Chu Feng firmly remembered the name of the Holy Light Clan.

The reason for that was because they were the overlord of a galaxy.

As there were only nine galaxies in the entire vast starry sky, it was obvious how frighteningly powerful the Holy Light Clan was to be able to become the overlord of a galaxy.

"I have mentioned to you before that your mother is not in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but instead in another starfield. I believe you still remember that."

"That said, in actuality, the distance between your mother and you is much greater than the distance between two starfields. The distance is the distance between two galaxies."

"The galaxy that we are in is called the Holy Light Galaxy."

"As for the galaxy that your mother is in, it’s called the Seven Realms Galaxy."

"Furthermore, the power that your mother belongs to is called the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion."

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

Following that, Her Lady Queen’s voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ears, “Chu Feng, the Holy Light Clan is the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy. The power that your mother belongs to is called the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Wouldn’t it mean that the power your mother belongs to is the overlord of the Seven Realms Galaxy?”

“That’s very possible,” Chu Feng said.

Whilst Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen were discussing this, the formation that Chu Feng’s father left behind was continuing with its explanation. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Feng’er, I believe you must have some guesses in your heart after listening till this point.”

“It is as you’ve guessed, the power that your mother belongs to is very powerful. They are so powerful that they control that entire galaxy.”

“However, even among galaxies, there are differences in strength. The Seven Realms Galaxy that your mother belongs to is stronger than our Holy Light Galaxy.”

“In other words, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that your mother belongs to is stronger than the strongest power in our Holy Light Galaxy, the Holy Light Clan.”

“I believe you must be very curious as to exactly how powerful the power that your mother belongs to is, for it to be this powerful.”

“Actually, it is related to the noble talent for world spirit techniques flowing through your body.”

“Gathered in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion are the strongest world spiritists in the entire boundless martial world. That place is the sacred holy land of world spiritists. That is the reason why it’s called the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was established after the Ancient Era, and has continued to exist for tens of thousands of years. And now, it has become akin to a clan, and not some simple power.”

“For the sake of preserving the purest and most outstanding bloodline of world spiritists, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has a special rule.”

“The rule is, those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion are only allowed to marry others from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Their bloodline is not allowed to be passed to outsiders. If one is to pass one’s bloodline to an outsider, it will be a very serious crime.”

“As for me, I am not a member of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. The fact that I was together with your mother and we gave birth to you meant that your mother committed a very serious crime.”

“As for you and I, we have committed a capital offense.”

“Capital offense?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously. His mood became slightly emotional. Anger was burning in his heart.

Chu Feng finally realized why his father would have such a reaction back then.

He also seemed to realize why his father and mother were unable to be together.

It turned out that it was because Chu Feng’s father and mother were not supposed to be together. Furthermore, after being together, they committed a very serious crime.

Chu Feng finally realized why his mother did not raise him after giving birth to him, and instead sealed two world spirits into his body before leaving.

It was because she had no choice. She was forced to make that decision.

Upon thinking of the suffering his mother had to go through all those years, the anger in Chu Feng’s heart burst forth uncontrollably.

In fact, surging killing intent was flowing from Chu Feng’s body. Like great whips, his killing intent filled the entire forbidden area.

“Feng’er, I believe you must be surging with rage right now.”

“However, I hope that you will be able to stabilize your mood and finish listening to what I will say next.”

“Both you and I are wanted criminals of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

“They want to kill us because I’ve made their Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s bloodline impure. As for you, you are what they view as their impure bloodline.”

“However, both you and I are still safe. The reason for that is because the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion does not know exactly who we are yet, nor do they know where we are.”

“The reason for this is because your mother decided to shoulder everything by herself.”

“Your mother used to be the most outstanding individual in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. She had the possibility of becoming the successor to lead the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It is all because of this matter that she ended up becoming a criminal of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and is currently being imprisoned.”

“Both you and I, father and son, have the responsibility to rescue your mother.”

“However, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is too powerful, so powerful that not even the current me possesses the certainty of being able to fight against them, much less the current you.”

“Just leave the matter of saving your mother to me, your father. After all, compared to you, as the husband of your mother, I, your father, should even more so rescue my lover with my own hands.”

“Furthermore, although your mother committed a serious crime, due to her talent, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion will not really do anything to her. Moreover, I will definitely rescue her one day.”

“As such, you do not have to worry too much about your mother. She is very safe right now, and will one day regain her liberty.”

“Father instead wants you to perform another task.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

A special sort of light emerged in his previously anger-filled eyes.

Chu Feng naturally wanted to save his mother very much. After all, she was his biological mother.

However, he also knew very well how small and weak he currently was.

He was simply unqualified to even speak about saving his mother, much less actually attempting to go and save her.

However, Chu Feng did not wish to do nothing. He wanted to help. Even if he was only able to help his father a bit, he still wanted to put all his effort into helping him.

And now, the opportunity to help his father seemed to have appeared.

“Feng’er, this is something very important, extremely important.”

“This is something that neither your grandfather or I managed to accomplish.”

“I hope that you will be able to accomplish what both your grandfather and I failed to accomplish,” Chu Feng’s father said.
