Chapter 4896: No Match

Chu Feng isn’t dead yet?!

The crowd was astounded, but they had no choice but to accept it with the truth shoved right into their faces. So, they quickly took cover behind Shengguang Menglai while eyeing her intently.

They didn’t say a word, but their gazes seemed to be asking ‘Didn’t you say that he has lost the energy from this cultivation realm earlier? Why did things turn out like this?’.

They had already checked Chu Feng’s cultivation beforehand, and he should have only been at rank nine Utmost Exalted level. On the other hand, Shengguang Haoxuan was at rank two Martial Exalted level.

Without the energy from the cultivation realm enhancing his powers, Chu Feng shouldn’t have been a match for Shengguang Haoxuan.

“This doesn’t make sense. You shouldn’t have the energy from this cultivation realm anymore. How did you do it?” Shengguang Menglai asked.

“Miss Menglai, you’re really underestimating me. Did you think that I would be incapable of dealing with you all without the energy from this cultivation realm?” Chu Feng sneered.

Boom!

An oppressive might swept in the direction of the Holy Valley’s juniors. Seeing this, Shengguang Menglai hurriedly released her oppressive might to fend against it.

“This aura...?”

The crowd widened their eyes in astonishment.

The oppressive might Chu Feng had released was incredibly powerful. If not for Shengguang Menglai’s intervention, that oppressive might would have been able to crush most of them to bits.

That was the oppressive might belonging to a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator.

“You’re at rank two Martial Exalted level?” Shengguang Menglai asked.

“Didn’t that old man tell you what happened? Ah, you must have really thought that I was a rank nine Utmost Exalted level cultivator,” Chu Feng said.

“You... hid your cultivation?” Shengguang Menglai asked.

“I didn’t hide my cultivation. It’s the people of your Saint Valley who used items to suppress my cultivation. As for the reason for doing so, they are obviously trying to protect you all. It’s quite a formidable treasure, and I wouldn’t have been able to break out of it myself.

“Fortunately, the energy from this cultivation realm isn’t anything ordinary either. It’s strong enough to even erode the treasure limiting my cultivation. I must say, the treasure you brought with you really caught me off guard. I didn’t think that you would be able to siphon away the energy I was harnessing, and it nearly foiled my plan.

“Luckily, I was already close to success, and I am a world spiritist on top of that. Even without the energy, I’m at least able to break the last bit of the treasure on my own,” Chu Feng said.

“So, you escaped in order to buy some time for you to destroy the treasure limiting your cultivation?” Shengguang Menglai asked.

“Indeed,” Chu Feng replied.

Shengguang Menglai turned her gaze toward the miserable Shenggaung Xuanhao underneath Chu Feng. Shengguang Haoxuan was not a weakling, and he should have been at least able to put up a fight against Chu Feng.

She didn’t see the battle in person, but the results showed that there was a huge gap between Shengguang Haoxuan and Chu Feng even though they were both at rank two Martial Exalted level.

“Chu Feng, what did you do? Why does Lord Baimei want to kill you?” Shengguang Menglai asked.

“Oh. It looks like you have received orders to take my life in the cultivation realm. Heh...

“Since you’re going to kill me anyway, why waste your time asking? Would you get on your knees and apologize if it was that old man’s fault?” Chu Feng asked.

Shengguang Menglai frowned upon hearing those words.

Chu Feng was right. If the Holy Valley really intended to kill him, she wouldn’t have let him off regardless of whether he had done wrong or not.

She was a member of the Holy Valley, after all.

“Chu Feng, you’re indeed a prodigy. I admit that I’m no match for you. If there’s a choice, I’d rather be friends with you. It’s just a pity that you’re someone whom our Holy Valley cannot condone. So... I won’t kill you right now, but I can’t watch as you continue harming the members of our Holy Valley. Will you put up a fight or surrender?” Shengguang Menglai asked.

“You want to stop me? Do you think that you’re qualified?”

Chu Feng burst into laughter, as if he had heard a joke.

Boom!

Shengguang Menglai released her oppressive might toward Chu Feng.

Boom!

But before her oppressive might could even touch Chu Feng, it was already neutralized by another force.

The Lightning Mark crackled on Chu Feng’s forehead, and his cultivation rose from rank two to rank three Martial Exalted level.

“Lightning Mark... He cultivated the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?”

The juniors of the Holy Valley exclaimed in shock.

They were still wondering why Chu Feng dared to act so arrogantly despite being only at rank two Martial Exalted level, but they finally understood where his confidence was coming from.

It turned out that he had cultivated the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and was able to raise his cultivation by a rank.

“It looks like you are really dim-witted. I’ve already told you that the old man sealed my cultivation in order to protect you all. Do you think that you would be able to continue suppressing me with that rank three Martial Exalted level cultivation of yours after I’ve broken the treasure?

“I’ll be frank with you. All of you are no more than fishes on a chopping board right now. You should just give up so as to spare yourself from some suffering,” Chu Feng said disdainfully.

The juniors of the Holy Valley frowned in displeasure.

Chu Feng’s rank two Martial Exalted level cultivation had far surpassed their expectations, but Shengguang Menglai was a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator!

Even if Chu Feng was able to raise his cultivation by a rank through the Lightning Mark, it still didn’t change the fact that he was a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator. How could a rank two be so arrogant as to dare look down on a rank three?

Klang!

Shengguang Menglai flicked her wrist and whipped out a silver spear. With a weapon in hand, her surroundings began to shudder intensely as if fearing her. At the same time, her aura also got considerably stronger as well.

That was an Exalted Armament!

“I was thinking of apprehending you and bringing you before Lord Baimei to ask the reason behind his decision. But since you’ve said those words, that makes me really interested in what you’re capable of,” Shengguang Menglai said.

Boom!

But the moment after Shengguang Menglai said those words, her knees suddenly caved in and fell to the ground.

It was Chu Feng. The Lightning Armor had appeared on him, raising his cultivation to rank four Martial Exalted level.

It was with his rank four Martial Exalted level oppressive might that forced Shengguang Menglai to her knees.

“That fellow!!!”

The juniors of the Holy Valley widened their eyes in astonishment. They never thought that Chu Feng would have the power to raise his cultivation level by two ranks in Martial Exalted level. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The least you can do is to rise to your feet first if you want to see what I’m capable of,” Chu Feng said.

“Hmph!”

Shengguang Menglai harrumphed coldly. Mysterious light began cloaking her body, causing her cultivation level to rise from rank three Martial Exalted level to rank four.

Now that her cultivation was on the same level as Chu Feng, she slowly began rising to her feet despite his oppressive might weighing down on her.

Seeing this, the nervous juniors of the Holy Valley heaved a sigh of relief. Some of them even smiled in glee.

Chu Feng was indeed strong. They had never met anyone as powerful as him outside the Holy Valley.

However, Shengguang Menglai wasn’t just anyone either.

Chu Feng only dared to act so arrogantly because he had the power to raise his cultivation by two ranks, but his advantage was undermined since Shengguang Menglai was able to raise her cultivation level by a rank too.

They hadn’t lost yet.

Putong!

But in the next instant, Shengguang Menglai suddenly fell to her knees once more.

The crowd was dumbfounded, including Shengguang Chuyao and Shengguang Xintian.

Four illusory divine beasts had manifested around Chu Feng, causing his cultivation to rise another rank to rank five Martial Exalted level.

It was at this moment that the juniors of the Holy Valley knew that they were goners. They knew that Shengguang Menglai was only able to raise her cultivation by only a rank in Martial Exalted level despite her overwhelming talent.

In other words, rank four Martial Exalted level was already her cap.

She wasn’t a match for Chu Feng at all!
