Chapter 3087 - Clan Chief’s Apology

Chu Feng’s name was resonating through the sky, echoing in all directions.

His name was being sounded nonstop. It seemed as if his name would resonate till the end of time, forever remaining in the world.

Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief raised his hand.

Once he did that, the shouting and high-spirited people immediately quieted down.

In the blink of an eye, everyone present closed their mouths. However, Chu Feng’s name was still echoing in the air, and only gradually settling.

When Chu Feng’s name finally stopped echoing, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief soared into the sky and landed before Chu Feng.

He placed his hand on Chu Feng’s forehead.

Although Chu Feng did not have much feeling in his forehead, he felt an enormous shock to his soul. That said, this shock was one of warmth.

Chu Feng was able to sense that something was currently being removed from his soul. As for that something, it originally did not belong to him.

It was an imprint. It was the imprint of ‘trash’ on his soul.

It was the imprint that the Chu Heavenly Clan had left on him. And now, it was being removed by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Senior?” Chu Feng felt very complicated.

Originally, he had wanted to thank the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. However, he wasn’t able to utter a word of thanks.

After all, it was as his father had said, the ‘trash’ imprint was branded onto their souls. Even if the imprint could be removed, the humiliation to the two of them would never be erased.

At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief saw Chu Feng’s complicated expression. He seemed to have realized something. However, he did not say anything to Chu Feng. Instead, he only smiled.

Then, he turned his gaze to the crowd present.

“It is as everyone has seen, Chu Feng is most definitely not someone incapable of cultivating.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Back then, this old man failed to carry out his duty. It was our Chu Heavenly Clan that failed to carry out our duty. Thus...”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief turned his eyes back to Chu Feng. He said, “... this old man owes you an apology.”

After that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief lowered his back and bowed to Chu Feng.

“Senior, you must not,” Chu Feng hurriedly rushed forth to stop him. However, he was simply unable to stop him.

“Chu Feng, this old man was blind and deaf. I made an incorrect decision.”

“Right now, I want to amend my mistake. I hope that it is not too late. Chu Feng, are you able to forgive this old man, forgive this clan?”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng was stunned. He was left slightly dumbfounded.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was actually really apologizing for what he did back then.

“Chu Feng, please come back.”

Right at that moment, everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan actually started to bow to Chu Feng. In unison, they called out for him to return to their Chu Heavenly Clan.

Regardless of whether they were doing it out of sincerity or hypocrisy, they at least all called out for Chu Feng to return.

The gazes of everyone from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were fixed onto Chu Feng.

They were all waiting for Chu Feng’s response.

While it was true that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and everyone else apologizing to Chu Feng, a person of the younger generation, was very unbelievable, Chu Feng had already revealed exactly what sort of talent he possessed to everyone with his performance this day.

Chu Feng possessed the qualifications to make the Chu Heavenly Clan apologize to him. To request his return to their Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Actually, my father mentioned something to me.”

“He said that regardless of whether or not the Chu Heavenly Clan is willing to recognize us father and son, the blood flowing in our veins will forever be the Chu Heavenly Clan’s blood.”

“Because of that, I, Chu Feng, have always considered myself to be a part of the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng turned his eyes to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He said, “Senior, please get up. There is no need to mention what happened in the past anymore. What is important is our clan’s future.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng helped the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief back up.

Then, Chu Feng cast his gaze across the crowd. He said, “Everyone, please get up.”

“Brother Chu, it is truly your Chu Heavenly Clan’s blessing to have a child like this. You must not let this child down again,” the Saintly Stellar Monk said.

“Unless this old man dies, our clan will never let down Chu Feng again,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Haha, that’s right.”

The Saintly Stellar Monk laughed. Then, he directly placed the Fire Qilin Armor in his hand onto Chu Feng’s body.

Chu Feng did not oppose it. After all, it was an honor to be able to have the Saintly Stellar Monk put the Fire Qilin Armor on him.

After wearing the Fire Qilin Armor, the aura Chu Feng emitted was far superior to that of Chu Zhiyuan. They were simply incomparable. It was as if the Fire Qilin Armor was especially created for Chu Feng.

The might emitted by Chu Feng caused everyone’s eyes to shine. Even the Saintly Stellar Monk was no exception.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you are a perfect match for this Fire Qilin Armor. It would appear that I have presented this gift to the right person,” the Saintly Stellar Monk said.

“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng clasped his fist.

“There’s no need to stand on ceremony. This gift is something you deserve,” the Saintly Stellar Monk smiled.

Afterwards, the Saintly Stellar Monk and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had a brief exchange of pleasantries, then left.

As for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he began to mention how to handle the Li Heavenly Clan to the grand characters of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Although Chu Feng’s display of his talent was something worthy of celebration, the opening of the Upper Realm Gate remained a disaster that the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would have to deal with.

The matter was like a heavy boulder crushing everyone’s chests, making them feel extremely uncomfortable.

Thus, as the ruler of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had to say some things.

Actually, what he said were merely words to stabilize the crowd’s hearts, to raise their morale.

However, his words were very effective. His words calmed the hearts of the crowd that were feeling extremely uneasy.

While the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was conversing with the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s grand characters, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generations surrounded Chu Feng.

Everyone wanted to seize this opportunity to befriend Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng’s gaze was not on those people. Chu Feng ran his eyes across the crowd. He was looking for that old lady.

That Illusory Blood Clan’s Clan Chief was someone with a definite relationship with his grandfather.

Unfortunately, no matter how much Chu Feng searched for her, he was unable to find her.

“Are you searching for that senior? She left when the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief was apologizing to you.”

Suddenly, a familiar voice entered Chu Feng’s ears.

Turning toward the voice, a beautiful woman was standing in the crowd not far from Chu Feng.

Her beauty was so exceptional that she could still be recognized immediately even when standing within the crowd.

That person was the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun’er.

Xia Yun’er was as beautiful as always. That said, this woman who Chu Feng originally viewed as a poisonous beauty gave off the sensation of an old friend when Chu Feng saw her again.

Chu Feng did not say anything in return. Instead, he smiled lightly.

Seeing the smile on Chu Feng’s face, Xia Yun’er also smiled.

Her smile was very sweet, very beautiful and very relieved.

She knew that Chu Feng was still the same Chu Feng. Even though he was overflowing with light now, even though he had reached a peak position that no one else could attain, she, Xia Yun’er, was still Chu Feng’s friend.
