Chapter 4708: Provocation

“Junior Chu Feng, are you joking here?”

Hei Yao immediately stopped him with a displeased look on his face.

“Senior Hei, allow me to take this battle instead,” Chu Feng repeated his words once more.

While his cultivation had only recovered to rank two Utmost Exalted level, his aptitude had already fully returned. His talent had always been top-notch, so he wasn’t worried about losing in this battle.

“Junior Chu Feng, even though you’re at rank one Utmost Exalted level, your results in the aptitude test aren’t good. Why are you insisting on taking this battle despite knowing the level of your aptitude? Aren’t you just causing trouble here?” Hei Yao spoke angrily.

“Junior Chu Feng, this isn’t just any fight. This concerns the cultivation of our juniors in the North Tortoise Hall. It’d be best for you not to get involved,” Wang Ziyan advised.

There were also many people aside from Hei Yao and Wang Ziyan who tried to stop Chu Feng from standing forward. Their tones were much more polite than Hei Yao, but it showed their lack of trust in Chu Feng.

“Trust me this once. I’m a disciple of the North Tortoise Hall too, and I won’t do anything to let you down,” Chu Feng said.

“You won’t let them down? Lad, I know about you. You are the newcomer who rejected the offer from the East Dragon Hall yesterday, right? However, don’t you think that you’re speaking big words here? Do you know who your opponent is? You’re facing Junior Bi Jingjing here!

“Putting you aside, even Song Xi wouldn’t stand a chance against her at all. Yet, you dared to say that you won’t disappoint them? How arrogant! Do you think that you’re the king of the world just because you managed to stand out in a group of newcomers?” Fang Yunshi looked at Chu Feng disdainfully.

“Was I talking to you?” Chu Feng looked at Fang Yunshi in disdain, as if the latter wasn’t worthy of talking to him.

“What do you mean by that? Are you saying that I’m not qualified to talk to you? Who do you think you are? Do you know who I am?” Fang Yunshi asked in displeasure.

Not wanting to bother with Fang Yunshi anymore, Chu Feng turned to Bi Jingjing and asked, “That senior over there, are you willing to compete with me?”

“You should decide it amongst yourself. It matters not to me whoever I am up against.”

Bi Jingjing didn’t even bother looking at Chu Feng seriously when she said those words, as if she was confident of winning no matter who she was up against.

“Let me do it then.”

As he said those words, Chu Feng began making his way toward the stone platform.

“Hold it right there.”

But before Chu Feng could walk up, someone grabbed his shoulder and forcefully stopped him. It was Hei Yao.

Hei Yao’s cultivation was at rank three Utmost Exalted level, allowing him to overpower Chu Feng in his current state. It was one thing if he was just holding back Chu Feng normally, but secretly, he was channeling his martial power into Chu Feng’s body.

This was clearly a threat that he wouldn’t hesitate to harm Chu Feng if he continued to press on.

“Scram!”

A frown formed on Chu Feng’s face as he roared angrily.

“Hei Yao, let him go,” Song Xi said.

“Senior Song, I can understand it if you condone Chu Feng for other matters, but this concerns the future of our juniors! I hope that you can think twice about it!”

Hei Yao released his grip on Chu Feng’s arm, but he had no intention of compromising. He even turned to the disciples behind him after saying those words.

The disciples of the North Tortoise Hall knew that even if they sent Hei Yao forward, it was likely to end in a loss. Nevertheless, at least there would still be a glimmer of hope with Hei Yao as their candidate. If they were to send Chu Feng instead, it was bound to be a loss.

Furthermore, even if Hei Yao lost, he was still of high aptitude. His loss wouldn’t reflect too badly on the North Tortoise Hall. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

On the other hand, Chu Feng’s aptitude was of the lowest level. If Chu Feng went up, they were bound to be humiliated.

“Senior Song, please think twice!”

The other disciples also tried to persuade Song Xi on the matter.

“Chu Feng, I understand that you wish to help me and do your part for the North Tortoise Hall, and I know about your strength too. However, this is the aptitude test over here. You should leave it to Hei Yao instead,” Song Xi said.

Even he was persuading Chu Feng to give up.

“Alright, I understand,” Chu Feng nodded. Then, he suddenly raised his head and said, “Song Xi, don’t blame me for this.”

“Ah?”

Song Xi was stunned by Chu Feng’s words.

Shoosh!

In the next moment, Chu Feng suddenly dashed toward the stone platform.

In the first place, he was already close to the stone platform, and no one was standing in his way either. By the time anyone could process what was going on, he was already on top of the stone platform.

Despite all of the opposition, he still persisted in his choice.

“Get down.”

However, as soon as Chu Feng stepped up, a force suddenly tried to sweep him down the stone platform. It was coming from Bi Jingjing.

“Why? Do you dare not compete with me?” Chu Feng asked provocatively.

Chu Feng knew that under the circumstances where no one was willing to let him take the battle, his only option was to provoke Bi Jingjing into accepting the battle. Only by infuriating her would he be able to represent the North Tortoise Hall in the battle.

Otherwise, even if he wanted to help the North Tortoise Hall, there was nothing he could do.

“You’re saying that I don’t dare? As I have said, you can decide amongst yourself. I don’t particularly mind. However, we should have the first go on the stone platform. You aren’t qualified to go ahead of us,” Bi Jingjing said.

“Junior Chu Feng, stop messing around. Hurry up and come back!”

Seeing that Chu Feng was going out of control, Wang Ziyan quickly rushed over to Chu Feng’s side and tried to pull him back.

“Bi Jingjing, right? I, Chu Feng, challenge you to a battle of aptitude. I guarantee that your aptitude is bound to be beneath me. If you are too cowardly to accept the battle, you should just admit it right now, and I’ll let you off,” Chu Feng said.

He spoke much louder this time around, using a far more provocative voice.

“Junior Chu Feng, stop messing around.”

Wang Ziyan had already arrived by Chu Feng’s side and was tugging him down.

“Hold it right there!” Bi Jingjing bellowed.

She was only at rank three Utmost Exalted level, the same level as Wang Ziyan. Yet, her bellow actually made Wang Ziyan shudder in shock. She immediately retracted her hand from Chu Feng and backed away out of fear.

It could be seen that Wang Ziyan was really intimidated by Bi Jingjing, but no one thought less of her due to that.

Given Bi Jingjing’s background, even Song Xi was afraid of her as well, let alone Wang Ziyan.

“You mentioned earlier that you’re confident that you’ll be able to defeat in a battle of aptitude, and I refuse, it would show that I’m afraid of you?” Bi Jingjing was finally looking at Chu Feng properly, and her eyes were blazing with rage.

Her attitude was so frightening that many of the disciples from the North Tortoise Hall dared not to look her in the eye.

“You’ve misunderstood, Junior Bi. That’s not what Chu Feng means. He has just joined the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, so he doesn’t know you well. I ask you not to hold it against him. He’s just...” Song Xi stepped forward and attempted to reconcile the situation.

“Senior Bi, you didn’t hear wrongly. I mean what I say,” Chu Feng interjected.
