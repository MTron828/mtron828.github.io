Chapter 5657: Comparable to Qin Jiu?

“She’s called Jie Ranqing, right? This god recognizes her. I recall that she failed the test, right?” the humongous existence asked.

“Milord, her performance surpasses that of the Heavenly King of Massacre’s first try even though she failed the test. The latter had to enter the Nine Heavens Secret Domain thrice before he finally cleared the test, and there was an interval of over a thousand years between the first time and the third time. By then, the one he cleared wasn’t the junior route anymore.

“In comparison, that lass from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion should be able to clear the test if she enters a second time. Based on her performance back then, she should have been able to challenge it by now, just that she has been held up by something,” the black humanoid figure said.

“That makes sense,” the humongous existence agreed with that judgment.

“However, I learned something interesting earlier,” the black humanoid figure added.

“What is it?”

“It appears that Chu Feng is that lass’ son.”

“Oh? Does that mean Chu Feng cleared the test thanks to his mother’s guidance?”

“It doesn’t seem so. I overheard Fu Xing and Chu Feng’s conversation that Chu Feng was separated from his mother at a young age, and they have yet to reunite with each other.”

“You’re saying he cleared the test with his own capability? If so, his talent is truly outstanding. What evaluation would you give him?”

“Milord, if not for the damage to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, Chu Feng would have surely cleared the test and left his name on the Overseer Monument,” the black humanoid figure said.

“Isn’t that evaluation too low?” the humongous existence asked.

“Is it low?”

The black humanoid figure was surprised since he thought his evaluation was very high. This was the Nine Heavens Secret Domain’s Overseer Monument they were talking about here! Those who had heard about it would know how much weight it carried.

“If I’m not mistaken, Qin Jiu from the Ancient Era was the only one who cleared the test in a single try, right?” the humongous existence asked.

“Milord, six people have left their names on the Overseer Monument, but Qin Jiu was the only one who cleared the test on the first attempt,” the black humanoid figure said as he widened his eyes in realization. “My evaluation was indeed low. It’d be more apt to say that he’s on par with Qin Jiu.”

“What’s Chu Feng doing right now? Has he left yet?” the humongous existence asked, curious about Chu Feng.

“Milord, the two of them have yet to leave. They are observing the spirit formation gate.”

“Is he unable to tell that the Constellation Gate is damaged and can’t be opened?”

“He probably needs some time to confirm it. His mother couldn’t tell the Constellation Gate was damaged when she took her leave back then. Similarly, it took the Heavenly King of Massacre three attempts to confirm that the Constellation Gate was damaged and can’t be opened,” the black humanoid figure replied.

All of a sudden, his face stiffened up.

“What happened?” the humongous existence asked.

He guessed that the black humanoid figure must have noticed something to react in such a manner.

“Milord, Chu Feng’s senses are sharper than I have expected. He has deciphered not just the sealing formation but the method to open the Constellation Gate too,” the black humanoid figure said.

“Deciphering the method is no big deal. He has to be able to construct it too,” the humongous existence said.

“Milord, he has already constructed the formation, and the formation is close to perfection… No, I’d say that it’s perfect even by my standards.”

“Are you certain?”

“Yes, I’m certain that’s a perfect formation.”

“There’s still such a prodigy around? It’s a pity the Nine Heavens Secret Domain has been damaged, or else he could have left his name on the Overseer Monument,” the humongous existence lamented.

“Milord,” the black humanoid figure suddenly spoke with a shocked tone.

The humongous existence knew that something huge must have happened for the black humanoid figure to react in such a manner, so it asked, “What happened?”

“Milord. Didn’t you say that the Nine Heavens Secret Domain is too damaged for the Constellation Gate to be opened?”

“That’s right.”

“The Constellation Gate is reacting to Chu Feng’s formation.”

“What did you say? Let me take a look too.”

The humongous existence’s eyes glowed as it began to observe Chu Feng.

“Milord!!!”

The black humanoid figure wanted to stop the humongous existence from peering outward, but he eventually decided to hold himself back. Nevertheless, his expression turned nervous, and he even hurriedly whipped out two black spears.

These two black spears were formation weapons, but they were far stronger than the God Armaments Chu Feng has seen. They were priceless treasures!

The black humanoid figure emanated a peerless aura with these weapons in hand, such that even the world shook in his presence. Yet, his gaze remained grim as he nervously eyed the abyss, as if there was an enemy beneath that terrified him.

…

Chu Feng and Fu Xing stood above a mysterious gate that towered at over a hundred thousand meters. He had constructed a formidable formation shaped like a key, and the mysterious gate immediately reacted to it as soon as the formation was completed.

Spirit power flowed from the center of the mysterious gate to form a keyhole.

“Chu Feng, are you really going to decipher the secret behind the Nine Heavens Secret Domain?” Fu Xing exclaimed in disbelief. Her body was even trembling ever so slightly, as she realized that she was still underestimating Chu Feng despite having raised her evaluation of him multiple times.

Chu Feng had brought her here, saying that the secret to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain lay inside this mysterious gate. He had grasped the method to open this mysterious gate from the earlier hall, and he generously shared the method with her.

She could tell that the method was feasible, just that she was unable to grasp its crux due to her limited intelligence and was thus unable to construct it.

Yet, Chu Feng managed to pull it off.

This made her realize how big the gap between them was. It was as if there was a flight of stairs with a hundred steps before her. She, despite being a top-notch prodigy, was only able to climb to the ninth step, so she thought no one in the world would ever reach the top.

However, Chu Feng managed this impossible feat.

The distance between the ninth step and the hundredth step was the massive gap between the two of them!

The formation at the center of the mysterious gate slowly took shape, manifesting into a keyhole that was a perfect match for the key formation Chu Feng had constructed earlier.

…

The fog-covered land shook intensely.

Countless roars reminiscent of the cries of vicious ghosts echoed, as powerful auras surged from the abyss. Every single one of these auras wielded the power to destroy a realm with just their will.

“Milord! Milord!!!” the black humanoid figure anxiously called out.

Weng!

The eyes of the humongous existence finally reverted to normalcy, as it retracted its gaze.

“Silence,” it howled.

The uproar in the abyss settled down. The world stopped shaking, and the terrifying auras dissipated.

“Hu!” the black humanoid figure heaved a sigh of relief.

He knew that those inside the abyss would not be able to get out as long as the humongous existence guarded this area.

“Hahaha! Interesting, interesting!” the humongous existence burst into laughter as it said.

The black humanoid figure used his detection method to peek at Chu Feng, and he finally understood why the humongous existence was so excited. “Chu Feng opened the Constellation Gate?”

“Our evaluation of Chu Feng is still too low. I’d say that he has the potential to surpass Qin Jiu in the future,” the humongous existence said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
