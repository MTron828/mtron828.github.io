Chapter 3877 - Challenging the Inheritance

At the moment when Chu Feng was looking at Yan Ruyu, Yan Ruyu also looked at Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, save me.”

Yan Ruyu had a look of pain. Her voice was filled with grievance.

“Yan Ruyu, what happened? Why are you here?”

Chu Feng immediately rushed towards Yan Ruyu. He wanted to talk with her to get details.

However, before Chu Feng could even approach her, Yan Ruyu turned into mist and disappeared.

Before disappearing, Yan Ruyu extended her hand and grabbed at Chu Feng.

Because of that, Chu Feng felt extremely depressed. He was able to tell that Yan Ruyu really needed his help.

“Why would this be happening?”

“Why would she be here?”

“Why did she call for me to save her?”

At the same time that he was feeling depressed, questions filled Chu Feng’s heart.

That said, he was able to be certain that the Yan Ruyu from earlier was not her actual body.

If it was her actual body, she wouldn’t possibly disperse into thin air like that.

“Wait, that’s wrong. The current me is also not my actual body. Instead, I am moving about using my spirit power.”

Thinking of that, Chu Feng became even more confused.

Since it was his spirit power, it meant that others would find it very difficult to discover him. Thus, how did Yan Ruyu see him?

Furthermore, how did she know that he was there?

Besides, this was an isolated space meant to test him. It shouldn’t be possible for others to appear in that space.

“Boom~~~”

At the moment when Chu Feng was lost in his thoughts, his surroundings started to sway. Following that, his awareness began to withdraw uncontrollably.

Chu Feng’s spirit power began to, uncontrollably, rush back into his body.

When Chu Feng opened his eyes again, he discovered that he had returned to the palace hall.

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to see that the strange palms that had enveloped him were also withdrawing.

Even the threatening and fatal aura of death was weakening. It was no longer a threat to Chu Feng.

“I’ve succeeded?”

“But... what was that earlier?”

“Could it have been... a dream?”

“No, that was no dream. That space earlier was not something I imagined in a dream.”

“Could it be that it was an illusion created by me because my spirit power was unstable?”

Chu Feng pondered nonstop. He kept feeling that things were not that simple.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had seen a mural when he entered the residence of the Ancient Era’s organisms earlier with the Mystic Cave Saints.

The person on the mural was someone that Chu Feng had felt resembled an old friend of his.

It just so happened that the person Chu Feng had thought the mural to resemble was Yan Ruyu.

It would be one thing if it was only that mural that resembled Yan Ruyu. However, with her sudden appearance in the isolated space, it made things very difficult to explain...

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, several figures suddenly appeared in the palace hall.

They emerged from the spirit formation gate on the left. Those people were none other than the Mystic Cave Saints.

The Mystic Cave Saints looked different from when they had first entered the spirit formation gate earlier.

They were emitting a faint light from their bodies. If one were to pay close attention, one would notice that the light was formed by talismans.

The sacred talismans had gathered and were emitting light. Like a protective barrier, the light enveloped the Mystic Cave Saints.

“It would appear that they’ve succeeded.”

Seeing the eleven Mystic Cave Saints all appearing in the palace hall again, a smile appeared on Chu Feng’s face.

That said, although he was feeling joyous for the Mystic Cave Saints’ success, the Mystic Cave Saints’ mood was not that good.

Even though their faces were covered, Chu Feng could tell that their mood was extremely bad.

The reason for that was because the Mystic Cave Saints were all weeping loudly like a bunch of pigs the moment they walked out of the left gate.

Although their weeping sounds were extremely unpleasant to hear, Chu Feng could tell that they were truly grieving.

“Brother Asura, why? Why did you refuse to listen to us?”

“To die like this, it’s simply too much of a pity.”

“You could clearly have lived. Yet, you insisted on dying. Why? Why are you so stupid?”

As they wept, they arrived before the gate Chu Feng had stepped into and complained about him.

Of course, they had no idea that Chu Feng was actually standing before them.

However, he was located in a different space, and was unable to communicate with them. Even though he could hear them, they couldn’t hear him. Naturally, they were also unable to see him.

Even though the Mystic Cave Saints were complaining about him after suspecting that he had died, Chu Feng actually felt very warm inside. At the very least, they were truly grieving because of his death.

Furthermore, after grieving and complaining, the Mystic Cave Saints did something that brought even more warmth to Chu Feng’s heart.

Under the proposal of the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints, they began to use special powers to forcibly open the gate. They were trying to rescue Chu Feng.

From the power they were unleashing, Chu Feng was once again certain that they had indeed obtained the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s acknowledgement.

They had obtained that special power from the gate of life on the left. Because of that, they wanted to attempt to use that power to rescue Chu Feng.

Unfortunately, their efforts were ultimately futile.

Even though they had been acknowledged by the Great Monster Slayer Emperor, they were simply unable to open that gate.

With that, they became even more certain that Chu Feng had died.

Because of that, they became even more heartbroken.

Seeing how much the Mystic Cave Saints were grieving, Chu Feng also felt very uncomfortable. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He began to think of all sorts of ways to communicate with them. He wanted to tell them that he was still alive.

“Buzz~~~”

However, at the moment when Chu Feng was attempting to communicate with the Mystic Cave Saints, his surroundings suddenly started changing.

A gate appeared in the isolated space he was in.

That was not a spirit formation gate. Instead, it was a giant gate.

That gate appeared very imposing. It resembled a giant mountain standing before Chu Feng.

Three signboards were hung on the two sides and above the giant gate. They seemed to be a rhyming couplet.

The former was: Enter gate, receive inheritance. Death is a possibility.

The latter was: Stay behind, separation disappears. Return to palace hall.

The signboard on the top read: Choice And Future Prospects

Seeing the words on the three signboards, Chu Feng came to an immediate realization.

If he decided to stay where he was, the strange space sealing him would disappear.

Chu Feng would be able to return to the palace hall and rejoin the Mystic Cave Saints.

The Mystic Cave Saints had already obtained their acknowledgement. Thus, they should be able to obtain the treasures in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

Although they were people that valued wealth as much as their lives, Chu Feng felt that they were also people with a baseline. According to their agreement, they would share a portion of what they’d obtained with him.

However, even if the Mystic Cave Saints obtained the qualifications to acquire the treasures, Chu Feng was still skeptical as to whether or not they’d received the actual inheritance.

Otherwise, why would that gate appear before him? The so-called inheritance gate?

Everything was written plain and clear on the gate.

If he decided to enter, he would definitely meet a trial.

The Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s inheritance was not that easily obtained. Otherwise, it wouldn’t say ‘death is a possibility.’

That said, when had Chu Feng ever been afraid of dangers?

If he feared death, he would not have chosen to enter the death gate.

Chu Feng looked towards the weeping Mystic Cave Saints and said, “Brothers, I will see you all later.”

Then, he pushed open the gate and entered it.

After Chu Feng stepped into the gate, the gate immediately disappeared. With that, the strange space Chu Feng had been restricted in also disappeared.

The Mystic Cave Saints were unable to hear Chu Feng. Thus, they had no idea that he had decided to challenge the so-called inheritance.

However, they were suddenly stopped their grieving. They seemed to have noticed something wrong.

“Brothers, did you sense that?” The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints asked the others with a very stern voice.
