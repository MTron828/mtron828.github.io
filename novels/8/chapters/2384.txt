Chapter 2384 - Jade Heavenly Sword Formation

“Chu Feng, don’t you make delirious utterances. Today, you will definitely not escape.”

Hu Xuanyi flew toward Chu Feng while holding the Incomplete Ancestral Armament in his hand. As he approached, he shouted to the crowd, “Set up the formation!!!”

“Clank~~~”

Once his words were said, the guardian clan’s elders present all revealed their Incomplete Ancestral Armaments.

Their Incomplete Ancestral Armaments were all swords. Regardless of their outer appearance or their auras, those swords were exactly the same as the sword Hu Xuanyi was using.

At the same time that they revealed their Incomplete Ancestral Armaments, the elders also began to emit jade green gaseous substances from within their bodies. The gaseous substances started to fuse with their swords and started to emit an extremely powerful aura.

Most importantly, as a world spiritist, Chu Feng was able to sense that the bodies of the guardian clan’s elders were in resonance. Furthermore, this resonance was very powerful.

As for this, it generally meant that it was the effect of a formation.

“Chu Feng, this is bad. That formation of theirs is no small matter. You must leave this place immediately,” Her Lady Queen warned.

“Understood,” Chu Feng did not hesitate. With the Magma Emperor Sword in his hand and the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique beneath his feet, Chu Feng began to rapidly fly away. He planned to escape from that place.

“Trying to escape? Don’t you think about it!”

Seeing that Chu Feng was escaping, the guardian clan’s elders all pointed the Incomplete Ancestral Armaments in their hands at Chu Feng.

“Buzz~~~”

“Buzz~~~”

“Buzz~~~”

“Buzz~~~”

“Buzz~~~”

......

In the blink of an eye, several rays of jade green sword auras were emitted from the Incomplete Ancestral Armaments. They began to chase after Chu Feng. They were so fast that one would become speechless upon seeing them.

The many rays of sword auras soon caught up to Chu Feng even though he had utilized his Azure Dragon Dashing Technique.

“This formation is truly powerful.”

At that moment, Chu Feng started to frown deeply. He was able to sense the frightening power of those sword auras. They had reached the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill level. Furthermore, they were on par with extremely powerful Emperor Taboo Martial Skills.

In other words, there were a total of several dozen Emperor Taboo Martial Skills surrounding Chu Feng.

“Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation.”

Placed in such a situation, Chu Feng had no choice but to unleash his strongest martial skill to scatter the sword auras that had surrounded him.

“Rumble~~~”

The Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation burst forth with overwhelming power. It completely dispersed the sword auras that had surrounded Chu Feng.

“How could this be?”

However, at that moment, not only did Chu Feng not have a cheerful expression on his face, instead, he had a very worried look.

He was shocked to discover that the sword auras he had managed to disperse were reforming. At that moment, they once again completely surrounded him, trapping him within.

“Chu Feng, it’s useless. Regardless of how powerful your abilities might be, you will not be able to break free from the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation,” Hu Xuanyi said complacently.

“Jade Heavenly Sword Formation, this is the guardian clan’s Jade Heavenly Sword Formation?!!!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Upon hearing the words ‘Jade Heavenly Sword Formation,’ those from the Lower Realms all revealed pleasantly shocked expressions.

The Jade Heavenly Sword Formation was the consummate skill of the guardian clan. It was extremely powerful. Among those with the same level of battle power, no one would be a match for them once the guardian clan used the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation.

Furthermore, the strength of the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation was also related to the number of participants setting up the formation. The more there were, the stronger it was.

Normally, the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation could be set up with only five individuals.

But now, including Hu Xuanyi, there were a total of twenty-seven individuals powering the formation. A Jade Heavenly Sword Formation unleashed by this amount of people was naturally no small matter.

“I’ve heard that the guardian clan’s Jade Heavenly Sword Formation is extremely powerful. Furthermore, it was said that ten thousand years ago, the guardian clan relied on the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation to beat back a True Immortal-level expert.”

“Seeing it today, it is truly amazing,” At that moment, even the extremely proud Kong Zheng was unable to stop himself from praising the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation.

As a martial cultivator, he was able to tell how powerful the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation was. It had already surpassed ordinary martial skills, and could simply be said to be invulnerable.

The way he saw it, unless Chu Feng was still concealing his cultivation... with his current cultivation and strength, he would definitely not be able to escape.

“Chu Feng, tell me how you got in here. Who helped you?” Hu Xuanyi asked Chu Feng.

“No one helped me. I charged in here myself,” Chu Feng said.

“Impossible. With merely your cultivation, how could you possibly be able to charge into our Hundred Refinements Stage?” Hu Xuanyi said.

“Cultivation? Could cultivation mean everything? If one’s cultivation means everything, then why has no one been able to take the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone over the years, whereas I am able to do so?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile. Even though he was already trapped by the formation, he was still as calm as before.

“You!!!” Hu Xuanyi turned pale with anger. The way he saw it, what Chu Feng had said was an insult to all of them. After all, among the people here, no one other than Chu Feng was capable of moving the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.

“Chu Feng, this Jade Heavenly Sword Formation is the strongest formation of our guardian clan. Although we are still unable to unleash the true might of the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation with our low level of cultivation, it remains that we will still be able to kill you with certainty should we determine to do so.”

“Thus, I urge you to act obediently,” At that moment, another elder from the guardian clan urged Chu Feng. Compared to Hu Xuanyi, his tone was much more good-natured.

Likely, he had managed to see through the fact that Chu Feng possessed an extraordinary origin. Thus, he did not want to make Chu Feng an enemy.

“This elder knows how to speak better. However, I’ve already said it. I will not tell you all how I got in. After all, even if I were to tell you all, you all would not believe me. Thus, it’s best that you do not ask me about it again.”

“If possible, why don’t you just release me? Like that, you would have made yourself a friend. I, Chu Feng, will remember this grace, and will definitely repay the favor in the future,” Chu Feng said.

“Release you? You are simply delusional. I might as well tell you this: regardless of whether or not you tell us how you got here, there is only one end for you -- death,” Hu Xuanyi said to Chu Feng.

“You are truly a dog of the Kong Heavenly Clan. After your master gave the order, you are determined to kill. You are truly obedient.”

“However, I might as well tell you this. While I cannot break through this formation of yours, with merely the strength of this formation, you will not be able to kill me,” Chu Feng said confidently.

“Arrogant boasting! Kill him!!!” Hu Xuanyi shouted furiously.

“Why are you all still standing there?!” Evidently, Hu Xuanyi was unable to activate the formation by himself. Thus, he turned to look at the others elders furiously.

“Elder Xuanyi, this child possesses an extraordinary origin. Must we really kill him? If we are to kill him, we fear...” The other elders were worried. They were naturally worried that Chu Feng possessed a powerful character behind his back. If they were to kill Chu Feng, retaliations might be made against them.

“I said kill him! Are you all planning to go against my orders?!” However, before those elders could finish, Hu Xuanyi lashed out angrily at them.

“We wouldn’t dare,” The elders all lowered their heads. Evidently, they did not dare to go against Hu Xuanyi’s orders.

“Then set the formation in motion!” Hu Xuanyi shouted.

At that moment, the elders present did not dare to hesitate. They obeyed Hu Xuanyi’s order, and all began to urge the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

In an instant, the jade green sword auras that had surrounded Chu Feng began to fly toward Chu Feng with deathly auras and the sounds of splitting wind.

“Rumble~~~”

The sword auras interweaved with one another. Energy ripples were surging forth. As the jade green energy ripples started to scatter, Ma Yue and Tian Yi felt pain in their hearts, and closed their eyes.

It was not only them. All of the people present felt that Chu Feng had died.

After all, the might of the sword auras was so overwhelmingly strong and terrifying.

However, right at that moment, Hu Xuanyi’s complexion changed enormously.

“Not good! He’s still alive!”

“How could this be?”

Following closely behind him, the other elders’ expressions also changed. They too revealed incomparable shock in their eyes.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

At that moment, the jade green sword auras once again reformed. They began to fly into the distance. In the end, they formed another net and encircled a region.

“Still alive? Chu Feng’s still alive?”

After hearing Hu Xuanyi’s cry of alarm and seeing how those guardian clan’s elders once again set up the formation, those who had no idea what the situation was started to feel completely baffled.

Confused, they all turned their gazes to the direction of the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation.

Finally, the ripples gradually dispersed, and the crowd managed to clearly see everything.

“What’s going on? There’s clearly nothing there.”

However, upon being able to see everything, Ma Yue, Zhou Zongzhi and the others grew even more baffled.

They discovered that there was nothing in the center of the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation.

“Have I been discovered? It seems that this Jade Heavenly Sword Formation possesses a special sort of sensing ability.”

Right at that moment, a wry laugh from Chu Feng sounded from the center of the Jade Heavenly Sword Formation.

Following that, five different elements appeared out of thin air. They fused with one another and formed into Chu Feng.

“He’s really still alive!!!”

Upon seeing Chu Feng, the crowd were all greatly alarmed.

The reason for that was because not only had Chu Feng reappeared, he was also completely uninjured.
