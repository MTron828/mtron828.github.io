Chapter 5896: Right to Sainthood

Chu Feng noticed that the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief’s expression was strained despite his cool words.

The clan chief was so powerful that Chu Feng was unable to estimate the latter’s cultivation level; all he could feel was the immense destructive energy exploding from the latter’s body. However, the pressure from the sky was even stronger.

It was a clash between two invisible forces, but their clash produced blinding sparks and devastating shockwaves that obliterated everything in the surroundings. The desert melted under the sheer heat from the clash.

However, it didn’t look like the clan chief could last much longer against the pressure.

Chu Feng was perplexed. It didn’t make sense for them to encounter such terrifying pressure. He felt that there was more to this matter than what he saw.

“Elder Clan Chief, let’s retreat first,” Chu Feng said.

“All right.” The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief tanked the pressure while the group returned to the white space.

As soon as they stepped into the white space, the dark lightning clouds above the desert dissipated, and the terrifying pressure vanished. The obliterated desert also reverted to its previous pristine condition, as if someone had rewound time.

“Chu Feng, that pressure is not to be underestimated. Is there a way to circumvent it?” the clan chief asked.

“I’ll have to test things out. Elder, you stay here and wait for me first,” Chu Feng said before venturing into the desert alone.

“Wait a moment,” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly spoke up before glancing at Sansheng Xingyu.

“I’ll go with you.” Sansheng Xingyu caught the drift and walked over to Chu Feng’s side.

Chu Feng acknowledged her with a smile. The two of them stepped into the desert together.

This time, the dark lightning clouds didn’t appear, but Chu Feng suspected that he might have to venture deeper into the desert to trigger it.

Thus, they journeyed deeper into the desert, and just as he had suspected, the dark lightning clouds soon appeared together with the pressure.

Without any hesitation, Zi Ling flitted over to his side.

“Zi Ling, you...”

“We came here together. We should brave the danger together,” Zi Ling said.

“You’re so stubborn. Since that’s the case, you’ll have to endure the pressure yourself,” Chu Feng said.

“All right.” Zi Ling nodded.

The pressure enveloped them slower than before, but it was nowhere as terrifying as before. They were able to cope with it, though there were pained looks on their faces. Chu Feng was the least affected one, whereas Zi Ling and Sansheng Xingyu frowned.

“What’s going on? Why is the oppressive might so much weaker this time around? Father, are you the cause of that terrifying oppressive might earlier?” Sansheng Qiutian asked. He might be candid, but that didn’t mean that he was a dense person.

“Does the pressure vary depending on the person?” The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief narrowed his eyes, but he didn’t say a word. He waited for Chu Feng and the others to return before asking, “Chu Feng, was the pressure stronger earlier because of me?”

He had his guess, but he still wanted to seek Chu Feng’s confirmation. At some point, Chu Feng had become the most trustworthy person in their group.

“That should be the case,” Chu Feng replied.

“It looks like this place doesn’t welcome me,” the clan chief replied with a bitter smile.

Chu Feng wanted to ask the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief if he could endure the pressure and continue traveling with them, but the latter’s bitter smile answered his question.

“Chu Feng, I’ll entrust them to you,” the clan chief said.

“As long as I’m alive, I’ll make sure to bring them out safe and sound,” Chu Feng declared. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He could say so confidently because he had found many clues along the way. The sacred mountain was constructed for the Three Saints Monstrous Clan, so there had to be a Three Saints Monstrous Clansman around to successfully breach the formation.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to breach the formation no matter how formidable he was.

Chu Feng, Zi Ling, Sansheng Qiutian, and Sansheng Xingyu entered the desert again. The dark lightning clouds soon appeared, and powerful pressure descended from the sky.

Chu Feng, Zi Ling, and Sansheng Xingyu had faced the pressure earlier, so they could at least maintain a mostly straight face.

In contrast, Sansheng Qiutian was in so much pain that he immediately fell to his knees and cursed, “Aiyo! The hell!”

The pressure was different for each individual. Chu Feng could help Sansheng Qiutian tank his pressure, but the pressure would then grow stronger till none of them could advance anymore.

“Ey!” The clan chief covered his face in embarrassment, but he couldn’t do anything other than wait in the white space.

He watched as Chu Feng pulled his son up and supported him as he staggered forward. They slowly advanced further and further, till they vanished amid the desert.

“Chu Xuanyuan, how are you so lucky to find such a talented wife and give birth to such a formidable son? I’m really envious of you,” the clan chief said with a sigh.

The lightning wasn’t the only obstacle standing in their way; there was also a huge sandstorm that hindered their vision too.

Fortunately, Sansheng Qiutian was in a better condition after consuming a pill from Chu Feng. He was at least able to walk by himself now.

“Brother Chu Feng, your pill sure is useful!” Sansheng Qiutian grinned at Chu Feng.

“That’s good to hear. Tell me if you’re feeling unwell. Don’t push yourself,” Chu Feng replied.

“Eyyyy~” Sansheng Qiutian sighed upon hearing those words. “Brother Chu Feng, Miss Zi Ling, will you look down on me for being so weak despite being the clan chief’s son?”

“How can someone of your cultivation be considered weak?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am weak compared to you. I only reached my cultivation level thanks to the resources from my father. It looks like our ancestor’s compass is off.” Sansheng Qiutian sighed in lamentation.

“Our ancestor’s compass can’t be wrong. Sansheng Qiutian, you just aren’t working hard enough,” Sansheng Xingyu suddenly angrily spoke up.

She was angry at Sansheng Qiutian for refusing to work hard despite enjoying the best cultivation resources.

“Xingyu, am I really not working hard enough? We have cultivated together from a young age, but when have I ever lazed off before? I...” Sansheng Qiutian spoke in agitation. He seemed to have a lot to say, but he stopped halfway through and shook his head. “Maybe I am not working hard enough.”

“What’s the ancestor’s compass?” Chu Feng asked.

Sansheng Xingyu was the one who answered the question. “It’s a special detection tool left behind by our ancestors. It determines whether one has the potential to become a saint or not. Only two of our clansmen have ever managed to evoke a response from it. One of them is our current Lord Clan Chief, and the other one...”

Sansheng Xingyu looked at Sansheng Qiutian.
