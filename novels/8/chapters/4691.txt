Chapter 4691: Rejected

Putting aside those with backing within the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect like Hua Xu, even the other disciples would usually turn down the outer elders after learning the truth. Even if they had promised the outer elders previously, the chances were that they would renege on their promise eventually.

Thus, it was very unlikely for outer elders to receive any disciples.

As such, most outer elders spent their Hidden Dragon Crystals to recruit new disciples, not with the intent of becoming their master but to enter the North Tortoise Hall. They hoped that the sect would reward them for their merit.

This reward wasn’t just limited to Hidden Dragon Crystals but cultivation resources too.

But of course, if the juniors they selected failed to clear the test, they would be wasting their Hidden Dragon Crystals in vain. In a sense, this was a little like gambling.

Those with sharp eyes, however, had a good chance at rising up the ranks from a lowly outer elder.

“Elder Duan, they said that you haven’t selected a disciple for the past 3000 years. Is it that you have never entered the Hidden Dragon Heaven Formation, or that the juniors you have chosen usually fail the tests?” Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.

“Heh... Didn’t I choose you in the end?” Elder Duan replied with a deep smile, but he didn’t answer Chu Feng’s question directly.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng felt that there was no way Elder Duan wouldn’t have selected a single junior who had the ability to pass the tests. Most likely, he just refused to enter the Hidden Dragon Heaven Formation.

Still, it was a little baffling for an outer elder like him to give up on the opportunity to turn his fate around. Chu Feng suddenly felt that Elder Duan was quite a mysterious person, and he couldn’t help but feel curious about the latter.

“Elder Duan, if I acknowledge you as my master, would you be able to leave the outer hall and enter the North Tortoise Hall as one of their elders?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, that’s indeed the case,” Duan Liufeng replied.

“Disciple Chu Feng paying respects to master.”

Chu Feng bowed deeply to Duan Liufeng with the intention of acknowledging the latter as his master. Even though they had only met not too long ago, he felt that Duan Liufeng was a decent person.

Most likely, he had his reasons for not choosing disciples from the Hidden Dragon Heaven Formation. That mysterious voice had forcefully altered Duan Liufeng to make Chu Feng the first junior he had recruited; in a sense, this was going against Duan Liufeng’s will.

Thus, Chu Feng felt a little guilt-stricken toward Duan Liufeng. He hoped to make up to the latter by acknowledging him as his master.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing?”

However, Duan Liufeng stopped him right away.

Despite so, they still caught the attention of those in the surroundings right away. Many of the outer elders were looking at Duan Liufeng in envy.

As long as any of the juniors that passed the test were willing to acknowledge them as their master, they would be able to leave the outer hall and enter the North Tortoise Hall. This was something that most outer elders dreamt of. However, this undertaking was deceptively hard, such that the number of outer elders that had successfully been promoted to the North Tortoise Hall was extremely low.

Precisely due to this, they were envious of Duan Liufeng.

On top of that, Duan Liufeng had never asked Chu Feng to acknowledge him as his master. Chu Feng had decided on it on his own accord.

“It’s no wonder why he says that he’s waiting for someone to catch his eye. He’s simply waiting for an obedient and gullible kid who’s willing to do his bidding!”

Elder Qian and the others began mocking Duan Liufeng coldly.

“Chu Feng, I appreciate your goodwill, but I, Duan Liufeng, have no intention of taking you in as my disciple. If you wish to find a master, you should find one in the North Tortoise Hall.”

Unexpectedly, Duan Liufeng actually turned down Chu Feng’s request. His action left all of the elders flabbergasted.

Why would an outer elder like him turn out something as good as this? They couldn’t understand what was going on anymore.

“This young friend over there, your name is Chu Feng, right? Duan Liufeng has always been an arrogant one, so you need not pay him any heed. If you need a master, you can come under my wing.”

“Chu Feng, you should choose me instead! I don’t have a single disciple under me at the moment. If you choose me, I’ll treat you like my child and impart everything I know to you!”

A shocking sight occurred. As soon as Duan Liufeng turned down Chu Feng, the other elders quickly stepped forward in hopes of winning Chu Feng over. On top of that, they were the people who had insulted Duan Liufeng earlier.

They really fully displayed the true meaning of shamelessness.

Faced with this situation, Chu Feng sneered coldly and said, “Pardon me, but in the outer hall, there’s no one other than Elder Duan who is worthy of being my master.”

“You!!!”

As soon as Chu Feng said those words, the outer elders glared at him in displeasure. It was one thing for Chu Feng to turn them down, but he even insulted them as well. They had never suffered such humiliation before.

However, perhaps out of fear of Duan Liufeng or the fact that Chu Feng had cleared the test and would soon enter the North Tortoise Hall, they didn’t try to make a move on him. They chose to swallow down their grievances instead.

“How arrogant. If I didn’t know better, I would have thought that you were the one who was going to enter the East Dragon Hall. What a pity that you are trash who barely qualified to enter the North Tortoise Hall.”

All of a sudden, a mocking voice sounded behind Chu Feng. It was Hua Xu.

“Hua Xu, I advise you to learn how to hold your tongue. Those who speak too much tend to get beaten up.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Chu Feng shot a disdainful look at Hua Xu. In truth, he had no idea why Hua Xu carried such great enmity toward him. He thought that Hua Xu was acting this way due to Elder Qian, but it was apparent that Hua Xu himself carried hardly any respect for Elder Qian either.

If he really had to find a reason, perhaps it was simply because Chu Feng stood out the most here and stole his limelight.

Chu Feng couldn’t be bothered to deal with people like Hua Xu, but if the latter continued messing with him for no reason, he had no intention of letting the latter get away with it.

“Beaten up? How arrogant! You say that you’ll beat me up? If you think that you’re such a bigshot, why don’t we fight it out then!”

Just as Chu Feng expected, his words had riled up Hua Xu.

“If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, I’m more than happy to fight you,” Chu Feng sneered coldly in response.

Without any hesitation, Hua Xu released his aura as a third rank Exalted level cultivator. He was really intending to get in a fight with Chu Feng.

“The two of you, what kind of place do you take our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to be?!”

All of a sudden, an elder’s voice boomed in the air, and an oppressive might crushed down on the surroundings.

It was from one of the elders seated behind the three stone platforms, and he was a pinnacle Utmost Exalted level expert!

These elders were from the North Tortoise Hall, and the elder who had just made a move earlier clearly had a higher standing than the others.

“Chu Feng, you might have cleared the test, but you shouldn’t get ahead of yourself. Arrogance will backfire on you, especially in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Your level of talent is no different from that of an ant here. So, clip your tail between your legs and tread carefully. You might be able to go a further distance this way,” the elder of the North Tortoise Hall berated Chu Feng.
