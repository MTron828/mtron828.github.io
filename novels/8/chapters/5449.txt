Chapter 5449: Protection Bane 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“In other words, you killed those juniors with the formation you grasped? What kind of formation is it then?” Eggy asked.

“This formation is called the Protection Bane. It has the power to curb any protective formations an individual is carrying within them. I bet they must have been surprised when their protective formations didn’t trigger earlier,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah! I did think that it was weird how none of the ten thousand juniors had a single protective formation on them. I thought that it was some restriction from the Infernal Realm. It turns out that you are the one preventing their protective formations from triggering!” Eggy exclaimed. “But don’t you think that it’s a waste that you obtained a functional formation after expending so much strength?”

By no means was the Protection Bane a weak formation. The ability to curb protective formations meant that Chu Feng didn’t have to worry about additional hands that others might have. However, the Protection Bane didn’t reach Eggy’s expectations, considering how he had absorbed all of the energy inside the Infernal Realm.

“My Eggy, I should let you know that the Protection Bane formation has no restrictions at all. No matter how formidable the enemy’s protective formation is, I’ll be able to suppress its activation as long as it is bound to their soul. Is that still not formidable enough for you?”

In contrast, Chu Feng was satisfied with his reward.

“There are no restrictions at all? Interesting.” Eggy’s disappointment alleviated upon hearing those words.

Most means came with restrictions. For instance, Chu Feng’s Divine Flitting only allowed him to escape from opponents who were a couple of cultivation ranks stronger than him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to flee from them.

An ability with no restrictions was naturally a huge deal.

“Furthermore, the Protection Bane formation has the power to dissect protective formations. This effect works not just on my enemies but on myself too,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re saying that you can examine the protective formation your father left inside you?” Eggy was delighted to hear that.

“Yes. I can feel my father’s aura in the protective formation he has left inside me, as well as perceive the structure of his protective formation. This is the first time I am sensing it so vividly.” Chu Feng was excited as well.

The protective formation was so well-hidden that he wouldn’t have been able to sense it so clearly if not for the Protection Bane formation.

“While the protective formation inside me can only be controlled using martial power, I can examine it through Protection Bane. That makes it easier for me to control it,” Chu Feng said.

“Will you be able to freely activate the protective formation once you grasp control of it?” Eggy asked.

“Yes, I’ll be able to do that. However, the formation is rather complicated, and it’ll take time for me to grasp it,” Chu Feng replied.

“What about its prowess then?” Eggy asked.

“I’m not sure about that yet. It’s a highly ingenious martial power formation that amplifies one’s power. I reckon that even an early True God level cultivator won’t be able to withstand the might of the formation, and that’s just a conservative estimate on my part. However, its effects span a colossal area. If it triggers on its own accord, it could probably blow up an entire Upper Realm,” Chu Feng said.

“I didn’t expect your father to be that powerful. He must have been at early True God level or mid True God level when he planted that formation inside you, and he probably has gotten much stronger since then,” Eggy said.

“Of course. He’s my father,” Chu Feng replied proudly.

“But speaking of which, your father sure is merciless. He left such a powerful formation in you back when you were still in the Martial Ancestral Starfield. If it had activated while you were still there… Tsk tsk, I wonder how many people would have been buried together with you. He cares a lot about you despite his words,” Eggy remarked.

Chu Feng responded with a warm smile.

While he hadn’t had much chance to talk to his father, he could sense his father’s love for him even from their first meeting. He was certain that his father had chosen not to keep him by his side for his own good, and he agreed that it was for the better that he grew up independently.

While the speed of his growth was much slower, he was able to build a strong foundation for his cultivation, unyielding willpower, and strong self-confidence. Those would prove to be invaluable in his future development.

Even though his parents hadn’t been by his side, they had been loving and protecting him in their own ways.

Chu Feng waved his sleeves, and the treasures from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s juniors flew into his Cosmos Sack. He also took their origin energies and passed them to Eggy to absorb. It was just a pity that their origin energies were too weak for Eggy to benefit much from it.

Whoosh!

All of a sudden, the All Lives Are Equal Palace trembled as a black aura poured out from within, completely sealing it off. The World Spiritist Painter was shocked.

He first looked at the Infernal Realm and noted that there was some time left on the incense stick. Then, he took out a painting and unfurled it, revealing a huge formation. He fused that formation into the All Lives Are Equal Palace.

The rate at which the incense stick was burning down slowed to the point of nearly coming to a standstill. At the same time, the World Spiritist Painter sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you should stay in there for the time being. It’s dangerous out here. Allow me to deal with a few problems first.”

Following that, the World Spiritist Painter threw out a communication talisman into the heart of Painter Mountain to inform someone about the current situation. Then, he flew right into the All Lives Are Equal Palace.

“Has it begun again?” Chu Feng was able to figure out what was going on from the black aura.

Those who were seeking to unseal the malevolent being in the All Lives Are Equal Palace were up to their tricks again. While he had known that they would make a move again, he didn’t think that it would be so fast.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Shortly after the departure of the World Spiritist Painter, several figures flitted across the air and constructed a sealing formation around the All Lives Are Equal Palace. They were from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

Jia Lingyi stepped out from the warship and walked to the All Lives Are Equal Palace. She took out a painting and unfurled it, revealing a blinding radiance. It was a formation too.

She placed the formation on the All Lives Are Equal Palace, and the rate at which the incense stick burned reverted to its original speed. With this, it wouldn’t be long before Chu Feng and the others were evicted from the Infernal Realm.

“It looks like you’re in cahoots with that fellow.” Chu Feng glanced at the black aura seeping out of the All Lives Are Equal Palace.

Jia Lingyi couldn’t possibly have the formation to control the All Lives Are Equal Palace, which meant that someone else must have given her it. Needless to say, that person was likely to be the owner of the black aura.

Jia Lingyi glared at Chu Feng with overflowing murderous intent.

“Milord, we have nothing to do with this!” the juniors inside the Infernal Realm cried in horror. They began pleading for mercy, fearing that they would be implicated in this.

“Scram right now if you wish to live. I, Jia Lingyi, won’t kill the innocent,” Jia Lingyi said.

“Thank you, milord!”

The juniors hurriedly made their escape. Within moments, Chu Feng was the only one who was left inside the Infernal Realm.

“Chu Feng, you’re doomed!” Jia Lingyi sneered.

“Is that so?” Chu Feng sneered.

As the one who had impeccably opened the Infernal Realm, he had other means up his sleeves. For instance, he could choose which direction to leave in. He could also use the power inside the Infernal Realm to teleport himself out.

This was a trick that not even the World Spiritist Painter was aware of.

In other words, Jia Lingyi’s sealing formation couldn’t stop him at all.

That was also why Chu Feng was able to remain so confident. He knew that he could safely escape from here even without the World Spiritist Painter’s protection. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect couldn’t keep him here.

“It’s over. The incense stick is about to burn down. Chu Feng is dead meat.”

Unaware of the truth, the spectators believed that Chu Feng was doomed once the Infernal Realm closed down. Just then, a voice sounded.

“Jia Lingyi, aren’t you here to save your son?”

The crowd, including Chu Feng, turned their gazes over. Two silhouettes had appeared in the sky.

“It’s you?!” Chu Feng was surprised.
