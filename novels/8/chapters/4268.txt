Chapter 4628 - The Master Arrival?

For the sake of obtaining the inheritance of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain, the crowd were acting unscrupulously.

Even those people that knew they had no chance were trying out their luck and sending voice transmissions to Chu Feng.

“All of you, shut up!”

Suddenly, a furious shout exploded in the sky. Then, boundless oppressive might covered the region.

It was the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.

Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted furious shout was filled with a threatening nature. Hearing that, many people began to panic.

They all knew that the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was a vicious and merciless individual. Who knows what sort of thing he might do.

That said, not everyone present was afraid of the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted. For example, there’s Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

“Ghost-face, what are you implying?”

Grandmaster Luo Tuo stared at the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted. Displeasure filled his eyes.

He seemed to be telling Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted with his eyes that he’d best not make an enemy out of him. If he tried to fight him head-on, he would definitely pit himself against him too.

Earlier, the two of them joined hands against Grandmaster Tang Chen because of Chu Feng.

But, in a blink of an eye, they’ve turned hostile toward one another.

Furthermore, it was also because of Chu Feng.

“Humph.”

Seeing Grandmaster Luo Tuo acting like this, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted snorted coldly.

But, he did not argue with Grandmaster Luo Tuo. Instead, he turned his gaze to the rest of the crowd. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Everyone, no matter what, you’re all people with some status.”

“Right now, what you all are doing is trying to catch a snow wolf empty-handed, an insult to your reputations.”

“Besides, who is young friend Chu Feng?”

“He is a world spiritist genius that has never appeared in the history of our Holy Light Galaxy.”

“To intend on becoming his master, everyone, shouldn’t you consider your own abilities first?”

After saying those words, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted looked to Chu Feng.

“Young friend Chu Feng, among the people present, only five are qualified to become your master. They’re Grandmaster Tang Chen, Grandmaster Luo Tuo, Celestial Fairy Muzhi, Old Man Compliance and myself.”

“But, the five of us are not all equal either. I am not tooting my own horn but if we are to really fight, I, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted, am most definitely stronger than them.”

Immediately after hearing those words, Grandmaster Luo Tuo cursed out loud, “Ghost-face, you’re truly one to blow your own trumpet. You, superior to us? Come, let us fight then.”

To the crowd’s surprise, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted decided to ignore Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

He continued to speak to Chu Feng, “Young friend Chu Feng, there are some misunderstandings between us earlier. But, as the saying goes, no discord, no concord.”

“I am truly appreciative of your talent. I am not coveting your inheritance.”

“I dare vow here that if I am to obtain that inheritance, I will immediately impart it to you,” said Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.

“Who would believe someone like you?” sneered Celestial Fairy Muzhi.

“A treacherous vile character. You’ve said all that because you wanted that inheritance. Young friend Chu Feng, do not trust him. That Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted is a truly treacherous fellow. He’s a vile and nasty man from head to toe.”

Even the shameless Grandmaster Luo Tuo was making cutting remarks about Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.

“Wuuahh---”

Suddenly, a scream was heard. It came from the Revered Master Beast Tamer.

Revered Master Beast Tamer who had been hiding behind Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted the entire time suddenly had his throat grabbed by none other than the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.

“Young friend Chu Feng, this is a show of my sincerity.”

After saying those words, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted clenched his hands. “Puchi,” blood splattered everywhere as the Revered Master Beast Tamer was reduced into a puddle of blood.

“Master!!!”

Seeing his master being killed, Li Fengxue snarled with grief and indignation.

“Woosh---”

Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted raised his hand and sent forth a backhanded slap toward Li Fengxue. Bang! Li Fengxue, like his master, was reduced to a puddle of blood.

The crowd’s expressions all changed upon seeing this scene.

In the Holy Light Galaxy, that Revered Master Beast Tamer was most definitely a top-rated world spiritist.

He was someone backed by some major powers too.

Yet, he was killed just like that. Most importantly, the person that killed him was someone that he possessed a friendship with, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.

This made the crowd once again realize how cruel the martial cultivation world was.

In this world, truly few people cared about friendship and camaraderie.

Before absolute self-interest, the majority of the crowd would abandon the so-called friendship and camaraderie.

The behavior of the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted perfectly illustrated what cold and ruthlessness was.

“Beast Tamer was a close friend of mine. But, since he plotted against young friend Chu Feng, his behavior was that of a vile man of nasty character.”

“To dare attempt to strangle the lightbearer of our Holy Light Galaxy, even though he’s my close friend, I will still not forgive him.”

Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted did not care about the crowd’s criticisms and, in a manner inspiring righteousness and reverence, justified his actions.

He acted like he was truly someone who placed righteousness above his own personal connections.

But, the crowd all knew exactly what sort of person this Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was.

“Heh...”

Seeing the hypocritical Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself from laughing. His laughter was so very mocking.

“Senior, there is no need for you to continue with this futile matter.”

“I, Chu Feng, entered the path of martial cultivation for the sake of protecting those close to me.”

“Even if they did something wrong, I will still protect them.”

“While I am not someone that will commit bloody atrocities and outrageous acts, I am not a selfless individual either.”

“My selfishness lies in the fact that I will only fight for those I care about. As for the life and death of others, I could care less.”

“Your earlier action was evidently in disagreement with my life’s philosophy. As such, it is destined that there will be no relation between us.”

“Besides, I don’t wish to become the next target for you to place righteousness above.”

Chu Feng spoke loudly. His ridiculing nature was fully evident in his voice.

But, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was actually not angered by Chu Feng’s ridicule. Instead, with a smile on his face, he said, “Young friend Chu Feng, you can most definitely trust my moral character. What happened between us was a misunderstanding. If you are willing to spend more time getting to know me, you will discover that we are most definitely fellow-minded people.”

“Ghost-face, you should just shut up. Someone as treacherous and nasty as you is simply not qualified to become young friend Chu Feng’s master,“ cursed Grandmaster Luo Tuo.

Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was finally unable to ignore him anymore and argued back.

Even Celestial Fairy Muzhi joined the argument.

At this moment, these grand characters were publicly insulting and slandering one another. Their behavior was truly inconsistent with their grand status.

But, it just so happened that very few people dared to laugh at them.

After all, there were a lot of people acting as shameless as them.

For the sake of becoming Chu Feng’s master, for the sake of obtaining the inheritance, they were all acting unscrupulously.

“Everyone, there’s no need to continue with your futile efforts. Chu Feng... already have a master.”

Right at this moment, a voice exploded from afar.

That voice was so deep and resounding that it caught everyone’s attention.

Looking toward the voice, the crowd were all surprised.

They simply do not recognize that person at all.

But, after seeing that person, Grandmaster Tang Chen’s expression changed. A smile appeared on his face.

As for Chu Feng, he was ecstatic upon seeing this person.

The person that appeared before the crowd was someone extremely ugly.

But, this person was someone he knew.

He was also the person Chu Feng wished to see the most.

This person... was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist!!!
