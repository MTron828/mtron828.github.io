Chapter 5461: Get a God Armament For Fun

“Chu Feng, isn’t that too risky? I don’t think that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted is as simple as he seems,” Eggy said worriedly.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was a Half-God level cultivator and God-cloak World Spiritist when he met Chu Feng, though he claimed that he was a True God level cultivator and a True Dragon World Spiritist at his peak.

Even so, he exerted immense pressure that surpassed what Eggy had sensed from others even though she had met many experts since. This made her realize that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted wasn’t as simple as he seemed.

“Indeed. I still can’t unseal the Evil God Sword to this day, so I doubt that I’d be a match for the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted even now. Furthermore, he’s in a different position from me. All he needs to do is to recover his cultivation, so his cultivation is bound to rise faster than mine. He’ll likely be much stronger by the time we meet again. However, I am progressing steadily too, so you don’t have to worry too much about me,” Chu Feng said.

“Who’s worrying about you? All you care about is your loyalty to your friend. I know that I can’t convince you, so do whatever you like,” Eggy scoffed.

She knew that Chu Feng cared so much about Wang Qiang that he would march straight to where the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted if he knew where the other party was, so it was futile to try convincing him otherwise. Still, she was displeased by Chu Feng’s recklessness.

Chu Feng could tell that Eggy was unhappy, but he knew that she was just worried about him. After all, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was indeed a major threat to him.

“Milady Queen, you must trust me. I can deal with the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. Speaking of which, what do you think about my secret skill? Isn’t it formidable?” Chu Feng tried to change the topic to coax Eggy.

“It’s not bad, but using it on yourself is bound to be different from using it on others. You’ll have to try it on others before we know whether it’s truly useful or not,” Eggy replied.

“There’ll be plenty of chances in the future,” Chu Feng said.

Instead of leaving the hall right away, he began examining his surroundings.

“What are you looking at?” Eggy asked.

“The formation here is ingenious. I’m seeing if I can comprehend anything from it.”

Unfortunately, Chu Feng was unable to decipher anything, so he left the hall shortly after.

Long Muxi, Long Chengyu, and the others were waiting for him in the mountain valley. They quickly rushed up to Chu Feng upon seeing him.

“How was it?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I succeeded,” Chu Feng replied.

“Show us your secret skill!” Long Chengyu said.

Long Muxi, the World Spiritist Painter, and the others also revealed expectant looks. They felt that Chu Feng’s secret skill had to be formidable, considering how it had used that monster as a medium.

“My apologies, Brother Chengyu. I can’t demonstrate the secret skill as it hasn’t fully matured. I’ll show it to you if an opportunity arises in the future,” Chu Feng said.

It was a lie. He didn’t want outsiders to know the effect of his secret skill yet. It was not to say that he didn’t trust them, but he wanted to keep it as his trump card. It goes without saying that he shouldn’t reveal his trump cards to others.

Even the closest friends kept secrets from each other, not to mention that Chu Feng wasn’t that close with them yet.

“What a pity. I hope that the secret skill quickly matures so that I can broaden my horizon. I’m looking forward to it!” Long Chengyu said. “If I may ask, Brother Chu Feng, who is your master? I heard that you’re from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Is that true?”

“I am indeed from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. It isn’t convenient for me to reveal my master’s identity, but he isn’t well-known in the vast world of cultivation either.”

Chu Feng didn’t want to reveal the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s identity. He knew that he would make dangerous enemies in the future, and he didn’t want to implicate the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“I understand. I never thought that someone as formidable as Brother Chu Feng would actually come from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. It looks like the Ancestral Martial Galaxy will be coming to prominence once again! How interesting!”

Long Chengyu nodded expectantly upon confirming Chu Feng’s origins. He couldn’t wait for more people to learn about Chu Feng’s existence.

“Brother Chu Feng, do you have a God Armament?” Long Chengyu suddenly asked.

“How could I possibly have anything of that sort?” Chu Feng shook his head.

“What a coincidence. I don’t have a God Armament either,” Long Chengyu replied.

“You too?” Chu Feng was surprised.

The Totem Dragon Clan was one of the most powerful clans in the entire world of cultivation. With the exception of the Eastern Region, the galactic overlords possessed similar strength to one another. In other words, the Totem Dragon Clan was a true behemoth that stood at the peak of the world of cultivation. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It was hard to believe that Long Chengyu, the young master of the Totem Dragon Clan, wouldn’t have a God Armament. Were God Armaments that hard to come by that even a behemoth like the Totem Dragon Clan didn’t have one?

But that shouldn’t be the case.

During the Trial of the Strongest, when the Demon Monk summoned innumerable chains to seal off the realm, Lord Long Xu from the Totem Dragon Clan had whipped out a golden sword to sever those chains. The golden sword should be a God Armament, given how powerful it was.

This meant that the Totem Dragon Clan did have God Armaments, just that Long Chengyu didn’t receive one.

While Chu Feng was wondering why that was the case, Long Chengyu spoke up, “It’s too hard to make a God Armament submit. Not even Xianhai Shaoyu has won the acknowledgment of a God Armament to this day. It’s only normal for us not to have one.”

“Brother Chengyu, to be frank with you, I don’t know much about God Armaments as our Ancestral Martial Galaxy doesn’t have anything like that at all. Can a cultivator only use a God Armament after receiving its acknowledgment?”

“Yes, God Armaments can only be used after receiving its acknowledgment,” Long Chengyu replied.

“I see.” Chu Feng nodded.

It was not to say that the Totem Dragon Clan didn’t have God Armaments, but that there were strict requirements that one had to fulfill in order to use it. Given how Long Chengyu hadn’t received the acknowledgment of a God Armament too, the hurdle appeared to be rather high.

It was then that a voice transmission was delivered to Chu Feng’s ears.

“Brother, do you want to get a God Armament to play around with? I owe you a favor for saving my life. However, I’ll need you to do something for me first. After all, God Armaments are too valuable.” It was from Long Chengyu.
