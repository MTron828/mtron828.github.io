Chapter 3733 - Universal Core

“Senior, you said that I’ll be able to fuse with my Divine Power soon?” Chu Feng asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“That’s right. You will soon be able to fuse with your Divine Power,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“But senior, didn’t you say that it would require me to create another dantian to fuse with my Divine Power? As for creating another dantian, it would take three hundred years at the minimum?” asked Chu Feng.

“Of course. If you are to attempt to create a dantian on your own, you’d need at least three hundred years.”

“However, it’ll be different with this.”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he opened his palm.

“Humm~~~”

The instant his palm opened, heaven and earth immediately started to tremble.

It seemed like an enormously powerful existence had been born.

Upon closer inspection, Chu Feng discovered that a body of light was floating above the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s hand.

Seeing that body of light, Chu Feng’s heart started to tremble. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

That body of light was merely the size of a fingernail. Yet, it seemed like an isolated world as it appeared before him.

It was a boundless and inestimably powerful world!!!

“Senior, what is that?” Chu Feng asked with a stern voice. He discovered... that the body of light was not a dantian. Yet, it was far superior to a dantian.

Likely, it was a natural oddity that was identical to a dantian.

“This item is called the Universal Core.”

“It is created from a natural oddity. This old man spent quite some effort to subdue and refine it.”

“It is capable of replacing any place in your soul. That of course includes your dantian. Furthermore, after this old man refined it, it is capable of being used by anyone.”

“With it, you no longer need to create your own dantian, as it is capable of harmonizing with your soul perfectly. It would be even more reliable than a dantian that you created on your own.”

“Of course, a treasure like this is truly priceless. Not to mention the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it would be very difficult to find even in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.”

“However, since you’ve passed this old man’s test, you will naturally be rewarded. This... is the reward that I’ve prepared for you,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Chu Feng.

“This...” Chu Feng was overjoyed. Yet, at the same time, he found it difficult to accept such a grand gift.

Chu Feng wanted the gift very much. Yet, it was simply too precious.

It was not because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said it was a priceless treasure. Rather, Chu Feng was able to sense that the ‘Universal Core’ was extremely precious.

In fact, Chu Feng felt that even though they were both natural oddities, the Universal Core was much more precious than Chu Lingxi’s Deepsea Pupils.

Even though the Universal Core would not be able to provide any direct assistance to Chu Feng’s martial cultivation, it would be up to it as to whether or not his Four Symbols Secret Skills would be able to return to being the Four Symbols Divine Power.

Chu Feng felt that this Universal Core would be able to help him bring out the power of the Four Symbols Divine Power even more perfectly.

“The reason why this old man set up the seventy-nine day appointment is because I wanted to see your character.”

“With your character, boy, you are qualified to become this old man’s disciple,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Disciple?” Chu Feng was surprised upon hearing those words. Then, he started frowning.

It was not only Chu Feng who was shocked. Grandmaster Liangqiu’s expression also became complicated.

“Boy, what is with your expression? Is something wrong with my proposal?” asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Senior, this junior once vowed that I would no longer take anyone as my master.”

“This is also the reason why i rejected even Grandmaster Liangqiu," said Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you possess outstanding talent. This old man also feels that I am unqualified to become your master. After all, the amount of help that I can provide you is truly limited.”

“However, brother Zhu’s ability far surpasses my own. If he is to become your master, he will definitely be able to provide you with enormous assistance.”

“Thus, young friend Chu Feng, you must not miss out on this opportunity,” urged Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Even though he knew that his brother Zhu was merely a disguise of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he was still used to addressing him as brother Zhu.

Furthermore, even though Grandmaster Liangqiu was clearly rejected by Chu Feng, he showed no trace of displeasure, and was instead trying to urge Chu Feng to become the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple.

The reason for that was because he knew that if Chu Feng were to become the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple, he would definitely be able to receive even more benefits.

After all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Not even Grandmaster Liangqiu knew how powerful he truly was.

As for Chu Feng, he felt very complicated and pained.

If he agreed to become the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple, he would be able to obtain the Universal Core.

That meant that he would be able to cut down on three hundred years and fuse with his Divine Power right away.

However, to no longer take a master was a vow that he had made for himself.

In the beginning, Chu Feng didn’t want to take another master because he knew that he was fond of getting himself into trouble, and did not wish to implicate others.

Later on, Chu Feng refused multiple people, including even Grandmaster Liangqiu.

If Chu Feng were to agree to become the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple for the sake of the Universal Core, it would be very unfair to Grandmaster Liangqiu.

In the end, Chu Feng clenched his teeth. He had made his decision.

Thus, he looked to Grandmaster Liangqiu and bowed respectfully to him. “Grandmaster Liangqiu, when this junior rejected you, I did not consider whether or not you were strong.”

“Ever since I left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, many seniors have wanted me to become their disciple. Without an exception, I’ve refused all of them.”

“Thus, it has nothing to do with strength. Instead, it’s this junior’s principle.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng turned to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and bowed respectfully. “Senior, thank you for all the help you’ve given me. This junior will definitely repay senior’s grace of saving his life. However, this junior has truly made a pledge to no longer take anyone as a master. Thus, even if it’s senior, I still cannot agree to become your disciple.”

Between a shortcut and one’s principle, Chu Feng ultimately chose his principle.

“This...”

Seeing Chu Feng being so stubborn, Grandmaster Liangqiu sighed.

He felt regret for Chu Feng. He felt that it was a major loss for him to refuse the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s kind intentions.

For the sake of a vow, he gave up on such benefits. It was truly too unworthy.

“Hahaha...”

Surprisingly, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into loud laughter after hearing Chu Feng’s rejection.

“Boy, you are truly amusing. Whether or not you agree to become my disciple is your decision.”

“However, whether or not I take you as my disciple is my decision.”

“Since this old man said that you’re my disciple, you are my disciple. No one can refute that.”

“Disciple, this is a gift from this old man. Accept it well!!!”

“Woosh~~~”

After he finished saying those words, he pushed Chu Feng’s body with his palm.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

In the next moment, Chu Feng revealed a look of pain.

However, that pained look only lasted an instant.

When Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu reacted to what had happened, they discovered that the Universal Core floating above the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s palm had disappeared.

“Senior, you!!!”

Chu Feng’s expression became complicated.

He was able to tell that there was no longer only a single dantian in his body. Instead, there were now two dantians.

One dantian contained the nine enormous lightning beasts.

As for the other dantian, it was completely empty.

However, that empty dantian seemed to be even more exceptional than his own dantian.

The reason for that was because that dantian was the Universal Core!!!

“Chu Feng, don’t bother with superfluous words.”

“You don’t need this old man to explain to you how to fuse with your Divine Power, right?”

“Go ahead and begin. Have Liangqiu witness whether or not I am really able to help others fuse with Divine Power,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Chu Feng with a smile on his face.

At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s eyes revealed a look of deep anticipation.

“Very well.”

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng no longer hesitated. He immediately closed his eyes and made hand seals with both hands before sitting down cross-legged.

In terms of fusing with Divine Power, Chu Feng was much more impatient than anyone else.
