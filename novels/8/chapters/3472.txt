Chapter 3472 - Abnormal Sign Or A True Dragon?

“In truth, even if everyone chose to walk above the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound, it would mean that they would be competing with one another in terms of their strength. Only those that are stronger will be able to reach their destination first. In the end, those that are weak will still have no chance at all.”

“If that’s the case, this year’s selection will simply be too simple and boring.”

Many people felt disappointed at that moment. No matter how they saw it, they felt that the new rules for the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars was simply too simple.

Although the crowd did not dare to openly voice their opinions, Wuming Ken was able to tell what they were thinking. That said, he was not at all displeased by them. Instead, in a deliberately mystifying manner, he smiled. Then, he suddenly clapped his hands and said, “Let’s begin.”

After he spoke, many Exalted-level experts immediately emerged from the Starfield Master Realm’s people.

Flying, they soon arrived atop the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

They stood there in an orderly manner. It seemed like they were setting up some sort of formation.

Following that, a jar appeared in their hands. They removed the seals on their jars and aimed the mouths of the jars toward the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound below.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

In an instant, rays of light began to shoot straight out from the jars.

When those rays of light landed on the ground, not only did the ground start to tremble, but roars could also be heard from the ground.

“That is?!”

The expressions of many of the people present changed.

What flew out from the jars were giant monsters.

Not only did those monsters possess enormous bodies, but they also looked very fierce.

“Those are ferocious beasts from the Ancient Era! What powerful ferocious beasts! The ten strongest ones are actually all Exalted level!!!”

Soon, the crowd recognized the giant monsters.

Those were ferocious beasts from the Ancient Era. They were much stronger than ordinary ferocious beasts. Yet, like ordinary ferocious beasts, they also did not possess any intelligence, but only possessed the desire to slaughter. Apart from their own kind, they would attack all living things that appeared within their range.

“Roar~~~”

Hostile roars began to sound nonstop. The Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts that landed on the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound had discovered the people that covered the sky and ground.

Some of the ferocious beasts began to violently gallop toward the crowd on the ground, whereas others soared into the sky and opened their mouths wide with the intention to attack the crowd in the sky.

There were even ferocious beasts that shot out wind blades or lightning bolts from their mouths. With overwhelming killing intent, they directly unleashed long-range attacks at the crowd.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Wuming Ken tossed out an item from his hand.

It was a little bell. However, after the bell was tossed out, it began to rapidly expand in size, and even let out ear-piercing rumbles. Those were the bell’s tolls.

After the bell sounded, the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts seemed to have been put under some sort of constraint, and all let out expressions of pain. Not only did they stop their attacks, they all dropped to the ground.

At practically the same time, the bell that was only the size of a fingernail became so large that it covered the entire sky. When the bell landed, not only were all the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts sealed within it, but it also covered a large area of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.

That was simply not a tiny bell at all. Instead, it was an enormous and shocking giant bell.

“Isn’t that the Starfield Master Realm’s treasure, the Giant Cosmos Bell?”

“That bell is no small thing at all. It’s a treasure from the Ancient Era. Reportedly, unless one is a peak Exalted-level expert, one will simply not be able to escape after being covered by the bell.”

“I’ve heard that that giant bell not only possesses great sealing capabilities, but there are also formations within it. Those formations are not spirit formations. Instead, they are formations created through martial power.”

The crowd began to spiritedly discuss the Giant Cosmos Bell, as it was an extremely famous treasure in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

There was even a rumor that stated roughly ten thousand years ago, there was a person of the Starfield Master Realm’s younger generation that decided to travel through the Ancestral Martial Starfield, and encountered two clans that were at war by chance.

That person of the younger generation called for the two clans to stop fighting. However, the two clans refused to listen. Furthermore, as that person of the younger generation had an insufficient cultivation, he was simply unable to stop the war. Fortunately, that person of the younger generation had brought the Giant Cosmos Bell with him.

Using the Giant Cosmos Bell, that Starfield Master Realm’s younger generation sealed the two warring clans and separated them using the formations within the Giant Cosmos Bell, preventing further casualties.

Furthermore, rumor had it that the Starfield Master Realm’s younger generation from ten thousand years ago was named Wuming Jiangnan. Currently, Wuming Jiangnan had become an Utmost Exalted-level expert and was ranked amongst the Starfield Master Realm’s Six Great Utmost Exalted.

Although Wuming Jiangnan was an Utmost Exalted-level expert of the Starfield Master Realm, his strength was still limited back when he was only a person of the younger generation. Yet, using only the Giant Cosmos Bell, he was able to stop the two warring clans. From this, one could imagine how powerful the Giant Cosmos Bell was.

“Strange, why would the Giant Cosmos Bell that is known to be completely sealed off have a gate?”

The people who stood directly opposite the front and the back of the Giant Cosmos Bell were able to clearly see that there was a gate at both the front and the back of the bell.

The gates were not large. They were merely ten meters tall and three meters wide.

However, the gates were very strange. The reason for that was because one gate was facing Chu Feng and the other competitors, whilst the other was facing the ten protruded peaks.

“Do you all still think that choosing the open path is easy now?” Wuming Ken asked loudly.

“So that’s the case?”

The crowd came to a sudden realization. It turned out that the Giant Cosmos Bell was actually the other path apart from the hidden paths.

The Cosmos Giant Bell contained formations inside it to begin with. Trying to pass through the Cosmos Giant Bell was very difficult. And now, there were all those Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts sealed within the Giant Cosmos Bell. Ignoring the True Immortal and Heavenly Immortal-level ferocious beasts, there were even Exalted-level ferocious beasts. Although they were only rank one Exalted, and numbered only ten, they were clearly not beings that the people of the younger generation present could possibly contend against.

Compared to the hidden paths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound, this open path was even more difficult to travel.

“The meaning of the open path is a path where one knows what to expect. Thus, I need you all to understand that the Giant Cosmos Bell has formations within it. If you all are to go inside those formations, it is possible to avoid encountering those Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts. However... that will take a lot of time. The amount of time that one will take, will depend on your strength, ability and wisdom. Of course... if you’re unlucky enough to encounter ferocious beasts that you cannot handle, no one will be able to save you.”

“As for the hidden paths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound, although many of you have all heard of them, they’re actually completely unpredictable. No one can expect exactly what will happen in them.”

“As for which choice you all decide to make, that will be up to you,” Wuming Ken said.

In fact, after witnessing those ferocious beasts, the crowd had already made their decisions. They were all planning to select the hidden paths. Even Chu Feng had decided to select the hidden paths.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng was very interested in the mysteries at the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. Since it was said that the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound’s hidden path was related to the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, Chu Feng would naturally be interested in checking it out.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, a loud sound suddenly exploded in the sky.

“What is that?”

The crowd’s expressions all changed. Even Grandmaster Liangqiu and the other experts present started to frown.

The previously sunny and cloudless sky was suddenly covered by dense black clouds, turning the region pitch-black and darker than night in an instant.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, another loud rumble sounded.

It was a bolt of lightning. At the same time as that lightning bolt appeared, light started to flicker, and the darkened sky immediately brightened.

“That is?”

At that moment, an expression of shock appeared in everyone’s eyes.

The reason for that was because that lightning was simply too abnormal.

Normally, lightning would disappear after a flash. However, after that lightning appeared, it did not disappear. As if it were a living creature, it spiraled around the sky and continued to grow.

The area covered by the lightning grew greater and greater. The lightning illuminated the surroundings brighter and brighter.

Most importantly, the lightning started to change. It was no longer simple lightning. Gradually, it changed its shape. It had become... lightning dragons!!!

There were a total of nine enormous lightning dragons galloping in the sky covered in black clouds.

One could not tell exactly how enormous those nine lightning dragons were. All that was known was that those nine enormous lightning dragons had completely covered the sky.

In that sort of situation, not only were Chu Feng and the other people of the younger generation’s attention completely focused on the lightning dragons, but even those from the older generation were unable to move their eyes from the unfolding spectacle.

It was all simply too shocking.

Those lightning dragons seemed so vivid and lifelike. It was as if they were nine real dragons, capable of utter destruction. It seemed like even space itself was on the verge of being torn apart by them. It seemed like the entire cultivation world would end up perishing.

“What is this? Is this an abnormal sign?”

Wuming Ken looked up. Even someone as experienced and knowledgeable as him was unable to determine whether the sight before him was an abnormal sign.

The reason why he was uncertain was because the scene before him was simply too imposing!!!
