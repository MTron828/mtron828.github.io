Chapter 4012 - Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted

The Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster found themselves in a very awkward situation.

They were unwilling to give up and allow Chu Feng to leave with the stone case’s mysterious treasure, but lacked the courage to continue to attack him.

They found themselves trapped between a rock and a hard place.

Furthermore, the crowd were all able to tell what the situation before them was like.

Thus, when they looked to Chu Feng again, their gazes became complicated.

Even though the great majority of the crowd hoped for the six great powers to be able to defeat Chu Feng, they had no choice but to admit that the youngster before them was simply too excessively powerful.

Likely, the battle would end with Asura’s victory.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk.”

Suddenly, eerie laughter sounded from the distant sky.

Looking towards the sound, a figure could be seen standing in the sky.

When he saw that person, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously.

Chu Feng had recognized that person. He was known as the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

Back in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb that day, the Mystic Cave Saints had originally grasped the decisive opportunity, and would’ve defeated the All-heaven Sect’s army even if Chu Feng hadn’t appeared.

It was that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted who had changed the flow of the entire battle.

In fact, if it wasn’t for Chu Feng obtaining the inheritance, he would have found it very difficult to defeat the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted too.

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was a vicious and merciless individual with extremely profound world spirit techniques.

However, if he were the only person that had appeared, Chu Feng would not be so flustered.

The reason for Chu Feng’s reaction was because of a thorny rope held in the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s hand.

That thorny rope was covered in sharp objects, and was crimson red. Caught in the rope, were eleven people..

Those eleven people were the Mystic Cave Saints.

The bodies of the Mystic Cave Saints had all been skewered by the sharp objects on the rope and were covered in blood. Looks of pain could be seen on their faces.

“Who are those freaks?”

The great majority of the crowd did not recognize the Mystic Cave Saints.

Thus, when they saw the actual appearance of the Mystic Cave Saints, they were curious, and even alarmed.

After all, the true appearance of the Mystic Cave Saints was incomparably ugly, monsterly ugly.

When Chu Feng saw this, his expression could not be described by mere panic. The anger in his heart exploded uncontrollably.

“Courting death!”

A furious shout exploded all of a sudden.

With the golden sword in hand, Chu Feng rushed towards the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

“Stop!”

Right after Chu Feng moved, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted let out a light shout.

Then, miserable screams sounded from the Mystic Cave Saints.

It turned out that once the crimson rope was pulled, the pain that the Mystic Cave Saints suffered would increase many fold.

The crimson rope had already penetrated the Mystic Cave Saints’ bodies like blades.

If the rope was pulled any tighter, their bodies would be cut through by the rope.

From the pained looks of the Mystic Cave Saints, Chu Feng knew that the injuries from the rope were definitely not limited to their physical bodies.

Their souls were also being injured by the rope.

That rope was capable of killing the Mystic Cave Saints.

Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately stopped.

What he had been worried about the most had occurred.

The reason why he panicked upon seeing the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted arriving with the Mystic Cave Saints tied to the rope was because he feared that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted would use them to threaten him, with him being powerless to save them.

At that moment, exactly what he feared had occurred.

“If you want them to survive, remove the power you’re using right now,” said the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

“I did not have any conflict with you before this, why do you obstruct me repeatedly?” Chu Feng narrowed his brows and asked sternly.

Chu Feng was extremely displeased.

He had originally thought that the outcome of the battle had been decided. Never did he expect the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted to appear out of nowhere.

Chu Feng knew that the situation of the battle had changed with the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s appearance.

“Indeed, we did not have any conflict before. However, I must settle the debt from the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.”

“Of course, I am not an overbearing individual. As long as you remove the power from your body, I will not make things too difficult for you.”

“However, if you think that their lives are unworthy of you doing that, you can pretend that I said nothing.”

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted laughed mockingly as he said those words.

The crimson rope in his hand then began to tighten again.

However, the Mystic Cave Saints were no longer screaming as resoundingly as before.

The pain they were suffering from was simply too much. Even though the pain was unbearable, it had made them too weak to even scream with vigor.

“Stop!” Chu Feng immediately spoke. He asked, “Will you spare them if I remove my power?”

“Of course. However, the premise is that you will have to guarantee that you’ll completely remove your power.”

“Otherwise, if you are to use your power again after I release them, wouldn’t I be the one to suffer?” said the Bloodmist Heavenyl Exalted.

“I have a condition. Release them too,” Chu Feng pointed to Zhao Hong and Han Xiu behind him.

“Asura, you must not do that. If you remove your power, all of us will die,” said Han Xiu.

Chu Feng ignored Han Xiu. He asked the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted again, “Yes or no?”

“I have no grievance with them. That’s naturally not an issue.”

“Tell them to leave. I will not stop them,” said the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

“Senior, please leave. Our grudge has nothing to do with you all,” Chu Feng said to Han Xiu.

“But...”

Han Xiu was hesitating.

Right at that moment, a voice transmission entered Han Xiu’s ears.

“Senior, the power I’m using right now is time-limited. I’ve actually reached the limit already.”

“The attack that I defeated the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster with earlier was my full-strength attack.”

“Right now, I am merely putting up a front. I cannot last for long.”

“Even if the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted didn’t appear, I would undoubtedly be defeated if those five powers’ leaders had continued to tangle with me.”

“I cannot persist for long. Please seize the fact that they’ve yet to discover my circumstances to quickly leave.”

“Even if I am to die here today, I hope that someone can avenge me in the future.”

Hearing Chu Feng’s voice transmission, Han Xiu’s gaze became even more complicated.

She had already anticipated what awaited Chu Feng.

It was most definitely death!

However, she did not hesitate anymore. Rather, she pulled Zhao Hong and planned to leave.

Even though she felt that she would be letting Chu Feng down enormously by leaving like this, there was nothing she could do.

It was as Chu Feng had said, rather than all of them dying there, it was better that someone was left alive so that they could avenge him in the future.

Han Xiu felt that she was not capable of that. However, she felt that Zhao Hong was capable of avenging Chu Feng. Thus, she had to bring her away safely.

“You look familiar. Do we know each other?”

Zhao Hong suddenly looked to Chu Feng when they were leaving.

“No, we do not.”

Chu Feng lied.

He knew Zhao Hong’s personality well. If she knew who he was, she would definitely not leave.

She would choose to stay and die alongside him.

“Thank you very much.”

After saying those words, Zhao Hong left with Han Xiu.

No one stopped them.

After all, Zhao Hong and Han Xiu had only come with the intention of taking care of the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

Now that the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster had been seriously injured, even if the people from the All-heaven Sect wanted to stop Zhao Hong, they were powerless to do so.

Whilst she was indeed injured, she was still a rank four Utmost Exalted, and could effortlessly kill all of them.

However, one thing worthy of mentioning was that even though Zhao Hong was totally capable of demanding the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster’s life, she did not.

Just like that, she disappeared from the crowd’s field of vision. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After Zhao Hong and Han Xiu had disappeared into the distant sky, the golden gas covering Chu Feng began to dissipate.

Once the golden gas disappeared, Chu Feng half-knelt in midair.

In an instant, his appearance had changed enormously.

Not only did his complexion become ashen, but he also became completely emaciated. It was as if all of his flesh had been sucked dry. Like a mummy, he appeared very frightening.

Furthermore, his health was extremely weak. Even though he was only just able to keep himself on one-knee in midair, his body still trembled violently.

“It would appear that that power has inflicted quite the burden on you.”

Seeing Chu Feng like that, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted spoke enthusiastically.

However, he had a smile on his face as he said those words.
