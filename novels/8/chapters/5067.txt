Chapter 5067: Comprehending Swordsmanship

“Heh…”

Chu Feng revealed a smile upon seeing how his attack had worked. This was the first time he was showing such a smile since the two of them began their duel.

“Hmph!”

Thinking that Chu Feng was mocking him, Jiang Yuantai harrumphed coldly and altered his spear formation, encircling Chu Feng within it once more. However, he found himself unable to curb Chu Feng this time around.

Chu Feng had completely abandoned his defense for offense, and every single slash was so unpredictable that Jiang Yuantai was unable to properly read them. Before he knew it, Jiang Yuantai found that he was forced to go on the defensive.

“Could it be that Chu Feng…”

The Lady of Dao Sea, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others widened their eyes in disbelief.

“That brat is breaching the spear formation!”

Jiang Taibai and the others from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect revealed a hint of unease in their eyes. It was one thing if this was just a coincidence, but they could tell that all of Chu Feng’s slashes were calculated to curb Jiang Yuantai’s spear formation.

In other words, Chu Feng had found a way to overcome Jiang Yuantai’s spear formation!

But the Three Souls Conqueror Spearmanship was a technique that Jiang Yuantai had devoted sixty years to master. How in the world was Chu Feng able to find a way to overcome it within such a short period of time?

There were only two possibilities.

One, Chu Feng was the same type of person as Jiang Yuantai. He liked swords from a young age and had learned a formidable sword skill. He had been hiding his true skills all this while, only revealing it now that he was forced to a corner.

While Chu Feng’s attacks looked random at first glance, they strung together to form a coherent and profound sword skill.

But if that was truly the case, why didn’t Chu Feng reveal his skills right from the start? He would have a much easier time winning the duel if he had gone all out at the start while Jiang Yuantai’s guard was down.

This argument made the second possibility much likelier. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Chu Feng was actually an incredibly talented cultivator who could decipher the spearmanship that took Jiang Yuantai sixty years to master, and the sword skill he was displaying right now was something he had come up with in the spur of a moment!

Considering how the duel had progressed thus far, Jiang Taibai and the others were convinced that Chu Feng belonged in the second category.

“Is that junior from the Eastern Region really that monstrously talented?”

The contempt in Jiang Taibai’s eyes had vanished without a trace, replaced with vigilance and a hint of fear. Those eyes were reminiscent of an adult wolf assessing a young tiger. He knew that even though the young tiger was helpless against him now, it was only a matter of time before the young tiger matured and crushed him beneath its feet.

“This is unbelievable. Young friend Chu Feng actually comprehended a sword skill to overcome that spearmanship!”

The Lady of Dao Sea and the Godwish Grandmother were excited to see that sight. It was one thing if it had been any normal spearmanship, but that clearly wasn’t the case. One would require extraordinary combat experience, great intelligence, and an exceptionally creative mind in order to pull off such a feat.

At the very least, it was impossible for ordinary prodigies to develop such a sword skill within such a short period of time.

Chu Feng’s fighting style underwent a complete change. His movements suddenly became extremely aggressive, leaving his opponent with no room to retaliate at all.

While this sword skill was developed in order to counter Jiang Yuantai, it would still be a formidable means no matter whom he used it against.

“Hmph!

Jiang Yuantai harrumphed coldly as his spear became even faster and stronger.

This time, Chu Feng was really unable to catch up with Jiang Yuantai anymore. As ingenious as his sword skill was, the gap in their raw physical abilities was too big that it could no longer be bridged with technique.

Even the ultimate skill would crumble in the face of absolute strength!

“How could any rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator be this powerful? Did he consume a forbidden medicine? That shouldn’t be. There aren’t any traces of a forbidden medicine at all. Is Jiang Yuantai really that powerful?”

The Lady of Dao Sea and the others revealed looks of despair upon seeing how Chu Feng was still being suppressed despite having developed such a profound sword skill.

Chu Feng’s performance in this duel had already far surpassed their expectations, such that they wouldn’t have expected this out of even the most talented junior. It was just a pity that Jiang Yuantai was unreasonably strong.

There was only so much Chu Feng could do against such an opponent.

In a moment of carelessness, Jiang Yuantai’s spear impaled Chu Feng’s left shoulder. It was a strike that not only injured Chu Feng’s physical body but his soul too.

However, this was only the start of his suffering. More and more spears pierced into Chu Feng, each of them drawing blood without fail. In just a matter of moments, his body was already covered in bloodied holes.

Chu Feng was far too overwhelmed by Jiang Yuantai to retaliate. Even blocking and dodging were impossible for him.

“Young master Yuantai, please show mercy to that boy! I have a use for him!” Sima Xiangtu exclaimed.

Needless to say, his real intention wasn’t to help Chu Feng but to make use of him.

However, Jiang Yuantai paid no heed to Sima Xiangtu and continued impaling Chu Feng without any mercy. He was infuriated by how a mere ant like Chu Feng was able to force him this far, and he wanted to vent his frustrations.

Be it Chu Feng’s arms, legs, waist, chest, or neck, there was not a single part of Chu Feng’s body that was spared from his spear. By this point, Chu Feng was already covered in holes.

“Big brother, this is enough,” another pleading voice sounded.

It was from Jiang Kongping, which was surprising considering how Chu Feng had previously held him hostage and publicly humiliated him. In fact, part of Jiang Yuantai’’s hatred toward Chu Feng stemmed from how the latter had treated Jiang Kongping.

There should have been no reason for Jiang Kongping to speak up on his behalf, but he did and it was effective.

Pu!

Jiang Yuantai launched his final pierce before finally stopping his aggression. It was just that this final pierce was aimed at Chu Feng’s head, skewering his right eye and piercing through the other side of his head.

Chu Feng’s body swayed along with the vibrations of the spear.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yuantai turned to look at the crowd with a haughty look on his face, as if Chu Feng was his prized trophy.

“That bastard!”

Wang Yuxian was infuriated by that sight. If not for the Lady of Dao Sea stopping her, she would have stomped up to confront Jiang Yuantai.
