Chapter 4068 - Won Beautifully

“I seem to remember that he also insulted my Chu Heavenly Clan?” Chu Feng said as he looked at Xuan Yihang.

Hearing those words, Xuan Yihang’s expression changed immediately. The Xuanming Family’s Supreme Elder also realized that the situation was bad. Because of that, he wanted to plead for leniency for his young master.

“Woosh~~~”

However, before he could say anything, Chu Feng’s body shifted, and he arrived before Xuan Yihang. He waved his sleeve, and with a “POP!”, Xuan Yihang was sent flying with a slap to the face.

When he landed, his face had changed shape, and he had lost consciousness.

The people from the Xuanming Family were all frightened to see this scene.

Chu Feng’s single slap was much fiercer than the thousand slaps those Xuanming Family members had given themselves.

With a single slap, Xuan Yihang was left on the verge of death.

Seeing Xuan Yihang’s dying look, the Xuanming Family members all felt very distressed and worried.

They were afraid.

After all, Xuan Yihang was the much beloved son of their Family Head.

How were they supposed to account for things now that Xuan Yihang was beaten to such a state under their protection?

“Buzz~~~”

Before they could even think much, the Xuanming Family members were all stunned.

They were able to sense a bone-chilling sensation enveloping the surroundings again.

That was not all; contained within the bone-chilling cold was an overflowing amount of killing intent.

The surging killing intent caused the surroundings to resemble a hell on earth.

All the people present were inside this hell.

That said, the terrifying aura was actually only felt by the people from the Xuanming Family. The residential cultivators of the Purple Star Upper Realm did not sense any sort of abnormal change at all.

They did not know why those people from the Xuanming Family were standing there stunned with looks of fear on their faces. Some among them were so terrified that they were actually crying.

It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s aura was threatening every single person from the Xuanming Family.

“All of you, listen carefully. Your actions today have already touched my limits.”

“By letting you all go, I am giving you a chance to turn over a new leaf.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I hope that you will be able to cherish this chance, and conduct yourselves with your tails between your legs from now on.”

“Do not continue to bully and humiliate others, especially not before my Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“If you all refuse to listen to my advice and dare to continue acting outrageously, I, Chu Feng, will wipe out your entire Xuanming Family.”

Chu Feng’s every single word was like sharp invisible blades that pierced into the hearts of all the Xuanming Family members present.

That was not a warning, It was a threat.

If they dared to commit such crimes again, Chu Feng would definitely not spare them easily.

“We wouldn’t dare, we wouldn’t dare. What happened today was all a misunderstanding, all a misunderstanding,” said the Xuanming Family’s Supreme Elder.

Chu Feng did not bother to respond. He waved his hand to indicate that they could leave.

Seeing that Chu Feng was finally allowing them to leave, the people from the Xuanming Family all rushed into the sky. In the blink of an eye, they all disappeared.

Thinking back to how grandiose and condescending they were when they arrived, and then seeing the sorry state they left in, the people from the Purple Star Upper Realm all felt very refreshed.

“Clamor~~~”

Suddenly, thunderous applause exploded.

Cheering sounds followed the applause.

“Chu Heavenly Clan, well done!”

“Young hero, your name is Chu Feng, right? You’re truly amazing. You actually managed to intimidate a Supreme Elder of the Xuanming Family to flee in defeat. I am in full admiration.”

It turned out that the applause and cheers were not from the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

Instead, they were from the people of the Purple Star Upper Realm.

Even though it was their first encounter with Chu Feng, they were won over by his performance.

“If anyone is to ask about the dispute between my Chu Heavenly Clan and the Xuanming Family, I hope that everyone here can testify for me. Today, it was not me, Chu Feng, who bullied their Xuanming Family. Instead, it was their Xuanming Family that tried to bully my Chu Heavenly Clan first,” Chu Feng said with a loud voice.

Chu Feng knew that the Xuanming Family was most likely not going to drop this subject.

They might even try to invert the truth, and speak ill of his Chu Heavenly Clan.

The crowd here served as the best witnesses to the truth. They were people that could prevent the Xuanming Family from inverting the truth.

“Young hero, you can rest assured. We of the Purple Star Upper Realm are people who make a clear distinction between gratitude and grudges. We will definitely help you spread word of what happened here today.”

“That’s right. That Xuanming Family is nothing more than the overlord of an Abandoned Starfield. Yet, they actually dared to strut around in our Purple Star Upper Realm. We shall properly spread this matter and make them famous for their disgrace,” the cultivators of the Purple Star Upper Realm guaranteed.

After taking care of the matter with the Xuanming Family, Chu Feng would naturally not forget about the gift the Purple Star Hall had prepared for them -- the vast amount of Purple Star Wisterias!

Due to the need to hasten with their journey, Chu Feng directly collected all of the Purple Star Wisterias and transformed them into cultivation resources.

Although the Purple Star Wisterias contained a boundless amount of natural energies and martial comprehension, and could allow one to make progress in one’s cultivation should one comprehend them carefully, they contained a relatively berserk power.

Thus, Chu Feng needed to use a spirit formation to refine them. Only after refining them could he use them to train.

After extracting the Purple Star Wisterias, Chu Feng continued with his journey and began to fly toward the direction of the Purple Star Hall.

Setting off again, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen’s mood had taken a massive turn for the better.

They were originally worried about this Feast at Swan Goose Gate.

Never did they imagine that right after they arrived at the Purple Star Upper Realm, they’d encounter the Xuanming Family and conflict with them.

But, to their even greater surprise, they not only achieved an overwhelming victory against the Xuanming Family, but they even won so beautifully, so refreshingly.

Of course, there were also people that were feeling worried. For example... Chu Hanpeng.

Chu Feng, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Hanpeng were all sitting inside a palace.

“Chu Feng, perhaps we should return these treasures to the Xuanming Family,” Chu Hanpeng said to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng didn’t answer. Instead, he looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. “Lord Clan Chief, what’s your opinion on this?”

“This is also the first time this old man has interacted with the Xuanming Family. However, I’ve long heard of their behavior.”

“We’ve already formed enmity with them today. Even if we are to return these treasures to them, they will definitely not be willing to let matters go.”

“If they were a reasonable power, they wouldn’t have insulted our Chu Heavenly Clan without cause, and tried to publicly plunder our Purple Star Wisterias.”

“Fortunately, although the Xuanming Family is very arrogant and tyrannical, they are the weakest of the Ten Abanoned Starfields next to our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“According to my knowledge, their Family Head’s cultivation seems to only be that of a rank three Utmost Exalted,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Rank three Utmost Exalted, was it? If that’s the case, Chu Feng should be able to handle him.”

“We won’t have to be scared of them then.” Chu Hanpeng’s expression changed to one of joy upon hearing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s words.

“Mn.” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded in agreement.

“Then, according to Lord Clan Chief’s intention, it would mean that we cannot return their treasures, right?” asked Chu Feng.

“Even if I wanted you to return them, would you?” asked the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Hehe. No,” said Chu Feng with a mischievous laugh.

“You brat.” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head helplessly. Then, he looked to the grand formation at the center of the palace.

Boundless purple light was acting frantically like ferocious beasts as they attempted to break free from the spirit formation.

However, the spirit formation was extremely stable. No matter how frantically the power struggled, it was unable to move the spirit formation in the slightest.

Instead, it was being slowly devoured and refined by the spirit formation.

The berserk power wreaking havoc inside the spirit formation was the energies gathered from the Purple Star Wisterias.

As for the grand formation, it was something that Chu Feng had set up to refine them.

As the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to the Purple Star Wisterias, expectation filled his eyes.
