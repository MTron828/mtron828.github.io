Chapter 2989

Suddenly, someone vomited blood onto the ground.

The crowd were all alarmed by this sudden scene. The reason for that was because that person was also a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, a member of the younger generation that would be entering the Nine Moons Sacred Domain this time around.

Furthermore, she possessed quite a reputation. Although her reputation was inferior to Chu Lingxi and Chu Ruoshi’s, she was someone who could be considered to be a genius within both the Chu Heavenly Clan and the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Otherwise, it would’ve been impossible for her to be qualified to partner up with Chu Haoyan in awakening their Yin Yang Fate Pearls.

However, why would she suddenly vomit blood like that?

“She’s been poisoned.”

An elder immediately rushed toward her to investigate her condition. He soon gave the answer as to why that woman vomited out blood and ended up fainting.

“Poisoned? Why would she be poisoned?!” The crowd were confused. Panic started to spread through the crowd.

“We will only know how she was poisoned when she wakes up. However, that poison poses no danger to her life. But, she will need a certain amount of time to completely remove the poison from her body. I’m afraid she will not be able to participate in the training in the Nine Moons Sacred Domain this time around,” that elder said.

“Sssss~~~”

At that moment, many people sucked in a mouthful of cold air.

Of all the times to be poisoned, she ended up being poisoned at that moment.

The crowd only thought of one possibility - someone was deliberately trying to harm her.

At that moment, many among the crowd cast their gazes to several people.

They were mostly women with decent strength. The reason for that was because those women were enemies of that poisoned woman.

As such, they were the first suspects that the crowd had for who had poisoned that woman.

“Hey! Don’t look at me! I didn’t do anything!”

“Big brother Haoyan, this is truly unrelated to me!”

Faced with the crowd’s gazes, those women hurriedly started explaining themselves. They even turned around to try to explain themselves to Chu Haoyan.

After all, that woman was Chu Haoyan’s partner. Since something had happened to her, it would also affect Chu Haoyan. This would not only be a problem of finding a new partner, but this might also end up affecting the level of Chu Haoyan’s Yin Yang Fate Pearl.

As for those women, none of them dared to offend Chu Haoyan.

“I will investigate this matter myself. However, I need a new partner right now.”

“Is there anyone that is willing to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain with me, Chu Haoyan?” Chu Haoyan asked with a cold and indifferent tone.

He simply had no concern for the life and death of the poisoned woman. The only thing he cared about was finding a new partner.

Once Chu Haoyan said those words, many women in the crowd immediately grew interested.

In fact, someone soon stood forth and declared their intention to renounce their previous partner to become Chu Haoyan’s partner.

Once the first person stood forth, more people immediately stood forth. In the blink of an eye, seven women had declared their intention to renounce their original partner and become Chu Haoyan’s partner.

However, even though this was the case, Chu Haoyan did not say anything. He was still choosing; he was trying to find the most suitable candidate for himself.

Her Lady Queen curled her lips upon seeing such a scene. There was actually an expression of contempt on her. She sighed. "The people of this Chu Heavenly Clan are truly heartless. Those were their partners that they had trained together with, how can they abandon them so easily?"

"It would appear that your clan simply does not possess any human warmth. They’re all a bunch of selfish people that place their own self-interest above everything else."

It could be seen that Her Lady Queen also deeply detested traitors that would put their own self-interest before all else.

"Little brother Chu Feng, little sister Chu Yue, is it possible for us to see your Yin Yang Fate Pearls ahead of time?" Right at that moment, a gentle voice was heard.

It turned out that it was the same woman who had asked Chu Ruoshi to show her Yin Yang Fate Pearl earlier.

Once she said those words, the crowd immediately turned their gazes to Chu Feng and Chu Yue.

It would appear that, compared to who would become Chu Haoyan’s new partner, the crowd were more interested in what level of Yin Yang Fate Pearls Chu Feng and Chu Yue were able to awaken.

Chu Feng revealed a smile at that woman’s request. He seemed to have no desire to refuse her.

However, Chu Yue had a cold expression on her face. Suddenly, she looked to the elder with the most authority here. She said, "My apologies, Lord Elder, I do not wish to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain together with Chu Feng."

"What?!"

Everyone present was astonished by Chu Yue’s words. This included those elders; they all had expressions of astonishment on their faces.

Chu Yue actually declared that she did not want to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain with Chu Feng.

Exactly what was happening? Could Chu Yue have gone mad?

That said, compared to the others, Chu Feng was extremely calm.

That said, no one noticed that Chu Feng also quietly put his hand that he was planning to open up to the crowd away. Contained within his hand was his Yin Yang Fate Pearl.

"Lil’ sis Chu Yue, what’s wrong? Why do you not want to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain with little brother Chu Feng?" It was Chu Ruoshi who first spoke to question Chu Yue.

"I wish to partner up with Chu Haoyan," Chu Yue said.

"This..." The crowd were once again astonished upon hearing what Chu Yue said. However, they soon came to a sudden realization.

It turned out that Chu Yue also wanted to hug Chu Haoyan’s thigh. That was the reason why she was pushing Chu Feng away.

That said, while the crowd were able to understand Chu Yue’s intention, they were unable to comprehend her behavior.

The crowd would be able to understand if it was anyone else that did this. However, because it was Chu Yue that did this, they were not able to understand it.

Chu Feng was also a thigh that Chu Yue could hug. There was simply no need for Chu Yue to do this.

Most importantly, while anyone else could do this sort of thing, Chu Yue absolutely could not.

One must know that if it wasn’t for Chu Feng, Chu Yue would not even have the opportunity to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain.

For Chu Yue to do such a thing, she was simply betraying Chu Feng, kicking her benefactor in the teeth!!!

"Sure enough, that girl has been plotting. Merely, I didn’t expect that she was actually bribed by Chu Haoyan."

"Even with how Chu Haoyan treated her, she was actually willing to betray you for him. Let this Queen out, I will kill that ingrate right now," Her Lady Queen’s face had turned deep red with anger. Her little fists were clenched tightly.

Even though both Chu Feng and her had anticipated Chu Yue’s betrayal, Her Lady Queen was unable to contain her fury when it actually happened.

"Forget about it. Let’s let her live. Letting her live would be the most painful thing for her," Chu Feng said.

"Ah?" Her Lady Queen was confused by what Chu Feng said.

"She’s doing this because she feels that it would be beneficial for her to rely on Chu Haoyan."

"However, sooner or later, she will know how foolish her decision today was."

"When she realizes it, she will regret her decision. At that time, she will fall into true suffering, and never climb out of it," Chu Feng said indifferently.

Not only did Chu Feng not reveal the slightest anger, he was instead smiling calmly. Chu Feng was simply so overly calm that he was frightening.

"Even though I keep feeling that you are trying to deliberately spare her, this Queen also wishes to see the regret on her face. I’ll do as you say and spare her life," Her Lady Queen nodded reluctantly.

"Little sister Chu Yue, what are you doing? With how much little brother Chu Feng has helped you, how could you leave him like this?" Chu Ruoshi spoke with anger in her eyes.

At the same time, many other people started to cast gazes of contempt at Chu Yue.

It seemed that no one was fond of this sort of traitorous ingrate.

This was especially true because they had all witnessed what Chu Feng had done for Chu Yue.

For Chu Yue’s sake, Chu Feng had made an enemy of Chu Haoyan. However, Chu Yue actually did such a thing to Chu Feng at such a crucial moment. Her behavior was truly too excessive.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
