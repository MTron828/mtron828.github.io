Chapter 4583: Failure!

Shengguang Xuanye was utterly infuriated. Not only did he openly dispatch his men after Chu Feng, but he even decided to investigate and capture those who were involved with Chu Feng.

He was determined to get rid of Chu Feng regardless of the cost.

The news raised a huge storm right away.

Even though Shengguang Xuanye had pinned Chu Feng with the crime of stealing the Holy Light Bloodline Essence and killing the members of the Holy Light Clan, most people knew deep well that the Holy Light Clan was just seeking an excuse to get rid of Chu Feng.

After all, it was too easy to pin accusations on a person, and it was not like anyone would dare to question the Holy Light Clan’s credibility.

And as for why the Holy Light Clan wanted to do so, everyone knew the answer deep down too—Chu Feng’s existence was a looming threat to their rule.

The fact that the Holy Light Clan was acting so quickly must mean that they viewed Chu Feng as a massive threat, or else they would have surely taken their time so as to minimize any adverse implications on their reputation.

Despite everyone knowing the truth, they dared not to speak it out loud. They feigned ignorance while lamenting Chu Feng’s pitiful fate. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, despite the Holy Light Clan’s attempts to pursue Chu Feng, it was all futile. In truth, Chu Feng had already escaped from the Storm Realm...

The reason why he was able to get out so quickly wasn’t because he possessed some impressive capabilities. Instead, the Divine Deer in his body had worked its magic once more.

Chu Feng had initially intended to torture Shengguang Yu and make the latter fear him so that he could better control him. He would then use him as a chip against the experts of the Holy Light Clan so that he could leave this place safely.

Yet, while he was torturing Shengguang Yu, the Divine Deer in his body suddenly spoke up and offered to bring Chu Feng out of the place.

With the Divine Deer’s help, needless to say, Chu Feng was able to get away with a hitch.

Before leaving, he left behind a formation in hopes to get the Holy Light Clan to rein themselves in a bit. It was not that he didn’t want to exact vengeance against the Holy Light Clan—he was, by no means, a forgiving person—but he was simply too weak at the moment that he couldn’t afford to worsen the grudge between them.

He planned to wait till he was finally strong enough before exacting vengeance on the Holy Light Clan. The warning was just a way for him to keep the Holy Light Clan in check.

After he left the Holy Light Clan’s camp through the Divine Deer’s powers, he quickly headed to the teleportation formation and left the Storm Realm.

Chu Feng wasn’t just fleeing blindly. He had a clear destination in mind. It was a place known as the Fate Ordinary Realm.

Fate Ordinary Realm was a barren world, and the cultivators that lived here were all extremely weak. It was to the point where they were weaker than even the cultivators from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

However, this was the place which the map made out of Niantian Energy in his body was pointing him to.

At this very moment, deep beneath the mountain range, there was a figure swiftly traversing through the underground, and he was no other than Chu Feng.

Despite already being very close to his final destination, he was still unable to find it despite having spent over ten days digging around the area.

“It should have been in the vicinity, so why can’t I find it?” Chu Feng muttered to himself as he came to a halt.

Despite his humongous capacity of martial power, he was panting at the moment from exhaustion. In order to find the destination pointed out on the map, Chu Feng worked frenziedly without rest, expending all of his energy. However, it was to no avail.

“Just where did I go wrong? I’ve already searched nearly every possible location here, but why is the destination nowhere in sight? What’s the problem here?”

Chu Feng thought with a tight frown. He was gradually becoming a little vexed at the lack of results.

However, it was then that his eyes suddenly lit up.

“I finally get it now! How could I have been so foolish?!”

Chu Feng struck his forehead as an epiphany suddenly came to him. A smile curled on his lips.

Following that, he closed his eyes and focused his consciousness into his body. Through doing so, he was able to look at the map formed out of Niantian Energy with greater clarity than before.

He had looked at this map countless times over the last few days, but now that he was looking at it in proximity, it appeared to be a little different from how he remembered it to be. He was able to see through a few things that made his heart skip a beat.

Shoosh!

In the next moment, his body suddenly began darting toward the map.

Whoosh!

Something bizarre happened.

Even though it was merely a map, as soon as Chu Feng’s consciousness came into contact with it, the map actually began morphing in shape. Billowing lava rose up from it, surrounding Chu Feng with its deadly heat.

This lava was terrifyingly powerful, such that Chu Feng would melt if he were to come into contact with it.

In truth, Chu Feng could have still made a getaway if he were to escape right now. However, he allowed the lava to surround him without making a move at all. As a result, the lava swiftly devoured everything in his surroundings, and it looked like Chu Feng was going to be next.

Unexpectedly, the lava didn’t harm Chu Feng. Instead, the world around him began to change!

The lava that was surrounding him suddenly vanished without a trace, and Chu Feng, who was floating in midair a moment ago, suddenly felt the ground bumping against his feet.

He was standing in the midst of lush meadows. There were tall mountains in the distance that rose into the sky. Above the clouds, he could see a waterfall and rained down like a silver dragon.

This was an incredibly beautiful world.

However, what caught Chu Feng’s attention was a silhouette. He wasn’t the only living being here; there was another person who had been waiting here for him for a long time.

And this silhouette was so familiar that Chu Feng was able to recognize the person through it. It was Daoist Niantian.

“It took you so long to discover that the destination lies in your heart. I must say that you did disappoint this old man a little.”

Daoist Niantian turned around to look at Chu Feng with his penetrating eyes.

It was only in this moment that Chu Feng realized that Daoist Niantian possessed terrifyingly powerful strength. It felt like Daoist Niantian was a god in this world, the supreme one who governed over everything.

All it took was a mere thought from Daoist Niantian in order to wipe him off from the face of this world.

“Elder, you did so much just to lure me in here. Is it really just a trial?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s indeed a trial. As long as you cleared the trial, you would have obtained even greater rewards. Unfortunately, you came later than I expected. I’ll have to inform you that you have failed regrettably,” Daoist Niantian said.
