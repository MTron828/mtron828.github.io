Chapter 4644: I Shall Protect Him

“Ki ki ki... Young lass, you’re still too young and complacent. It looks like you have never suffered any setbacks before.”

The Blood Asura Tribe’s world spirit licked his own lips, sending shudders down everyone’s spine.

“You’re courting death.”

Yu Sha felt deeply offended by that licentious action, and she felt more determined than ever to cut down the opponent before her.

She released her grip on her black swords and quickly backed off. At the same time, she summoned her black aura once more, but this time around, they morphed not into a pair of swords but a black steed.

The black steed looked extremely lifelike, as if it had a life of its own.

Yu Sha leaped onto the black steed before raising her right hand up, and a black spear swiftly manifested in her grasp.

At the same, black aura swirled around her body and formed a set of black armor.

The current Yu Sha looked more valiant than ever.

Neighhhhh—

The black steed roared furiously as it charged at the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit.

Faced with Yu Sha’s second round of offense, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit appeared to be much less relaxed than before. He clasped his hands together, and two massive steel hammer formed in his hands.

This time around, he crossed blows with Yu Sha seriously.

Soon, the crowd astonishingly noticed that the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit who had just grasped Yu Sha’s blades barehanded earlier had fallen into a disadvantageous position this time around.

And the reason behind that was due to the black steed Yu Sha had summoned significantly enhancing her fighting prowess.

“This isn’t good. That lad’s world spirit appears to be incredibly powerful as well.”

Yu Sha’s performance brought looks of envy on the faces of the world spiritists around, most notably the male ones.

Regardless of whether she won the duel or not, there was no one present who would deny Yu Sha’s strength anymore.

However, Chu Feng was the only one who knew that Yu Sha wasn’t in her strongest state yet. Had it not been for the sealing of her powers, just the summoning of the black steed would have raised her cultivation by a rank, allowing her to completely overpower the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit.

The black steed wasn’t showing its true prowess at the moment.

That being said, it was still offering Yu Sha the power boost she needed right now.

“Young lass, I’m really fond of you, so I don’t want to hurt you. Why don’t you consider becoming my concubine? I’ll let you enjoy your fair share of glory. Putting this place aside, no one will dare disrespect you even after you return to the Asura Spirit World.”

Even though the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit was in a disadvantageous position, he wasn’t flustered at all. He was even in the mood to continuing teasing Yu Sha.

Shoosh!

Right after he said those words, Yu Sha suddenly drove his spear upward to impale his mouth. She might not have said a word thus far, but she couldn’t have given a better answer to his question.

However, it was this very attack that brought the second shock to the crowd.

Faced with Yu Sha’s attack, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit chose not to dodge. Instead, he opened his mouth wide and bit down on Yu Sha’s black spear, holding it in place with his teeth.

Then, he bit down harder, and with a loud ‘kacha’, the black spear was actually split into two halves.

As it turned out, the world spirit had been concealing his true strength. He was actually far stronger than Yu Sha!

“Yu Sha, return!”

Seeing that the situation had turned for the worst-case scenario, Chu Feng hurriedly shouted for Yu Sha to return. The strength of the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit was clearly above that of Yu Sha. She didn’t stand a chance at all.

“Hmph!”

Yet, Yu Sha simply harrumphed coldly. She quickly recreated her black spear as if nothing had happened before launching a new wave of attacks.

This time, Yu Sha’s strength grew once more.

However, Chu Feng noticed that something was amiss. It wasn’t just Yu Sha’s black aura that was flurrying; there was something amidst it too. It was as if she was using something else to fuel her strength.

“Yu Sha, stop it! Stop it right now!”

Chu Feng had a feeling that Yu Sha was using a means that traded her life in exchange for strength just so that she could keep up with the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit, so he urged her to stop. However, Yu Sha simply refused to back down.

“Young lass, you’re grinding my patience thin. Since you don’t know your place, I shan’t hold back anymore then.”

Right after saying those words, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit raised his palm struck it down. It stirred up a huge gale that tore through the fabrics of space.

It almost seemed like a tornado was rushing straight for Yu Sha.

This palm didn’t land directly on Yu Sha, but even the shockwave from a distance away was more than enough to knock Yu Sha back, sending her flying several meters away. Even though she regained her balance swiftly, there was a trail of fresh blood flowing down the corner of her lips.

Even her complexion was slightly pale.

It was just a single strike, but Yu Sha had already sustained significant damage.

“You can’t possibly defeat me. I’m not as weak as you think.”

Boom!

The Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit suddenly released the aura in his body like a furious storm. At the same time, he also released his oppressive might, revealing strength that far exceeded Yu Sha.

As it turned out, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit was not at rank one Martial Exalted level but rank two. He had intentionally hidden its strength so as to make fun of Yu Sha.

It was no wonder why Yu Sha was unable to suppress him no matter how she tried to raise her strength. There was simply too huge of a gap in their absolute strength.

“I’ll give you one last chance. You can either become my concubine or a corpse here,” the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit told Yu Sha. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Someone is indeed going to die here, but that person is no other than you!”

Yu Sha stood up and brandished her spear. It was obvious that she was intending to continue the fight.

Weng!

It was then that a spirit formation gate suddenly appeared behind Yu Sha. It was Chu Feng’s doing.

“Yuu Sha, stop right now. This duel ends here.”

Not only had Chu Feng opened the spirit formation gate, but he had run forward to drag Yu Sha off, hoping to push her through it. However, due to the difference in their strength, he was unable to move her at all.

Shoosh!

Yu Sha simply waved her sleeves and pushed Chu Feng behind her.

“I have to win this duel.”

Yu Sha shot a glance at Chu Feng as she spoke. There was unwavering determination in her beautiful eyes.

Boom!

Black aura flurried within Yu Sha’s body once more, threatening to erupt like a volcano. At the same time, the power she gained from burning up her life force gushed forth once more with greater fervor than before.

She was really putting her life on the line here!”

“You’re burning your bloodline? You’re willing to forsake your life for this fellow? Looks like the two of you are quite close with one another, huh? Since that’s the case, the two of you should just die together!”

Right after saying those words, the Asura Blood Tribe’s world spirit opened his mouth wide and shot out a gush of black aura. The black aura, harnessing the oppressive might of a rank two Martial Exalted cultivator, was aimed right at Chu Feng and Yu Sha.

Putting aside Chu Feng, not even Yu Sha was able to react in time.

While the two of them were still off guard, the black aura had already arrived before the two of them. Were this strike to land, the two of them would lose their lives.

Bam!

It was at this critical moment that the black aura suddenly burst apart before the two of them. Due to the overwhelming strength of the black aura, the shockwaves from the explosions were extraordinarily powerful. They swept into the surroundings with great force, but amazingly, they didn’t hurt Chu Feng and Yu Sha at all.

As it turned out, there was an invisible barrier blocking the shockwaves.

“Is it Lord Black Demon?”

Everyone turned to the Wretched Black Demon, thinking that he had made a move to save Yu Sha and Chu Feng.

“There’s no need to look at me. This isn’t my doing.”

However, the Wretched Black Demon shook his head, denying the claims.

“It isn’t Lord Black Demon?”

Those words confused not just the onlookers but Chu Feng and Yu Sha as well. Both of them knew that they didn’t have the ability to block against this attack. If it was neither them nor the Wretched Black Demon, who else could it be?

While everyone was still confused, a pleasant voice suddenly sounded from the spirit formation gate behind Chu Feng and Yu Sha.

“Your name is Yu Sha, right? You’ve worked hard. However, leave the rest to this Queen.”

Along with those words, an absolutely beautiful figure began making her way out from the spirit formation gate.
