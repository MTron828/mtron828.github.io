Chapter 4812: I Miss You

“Chu Feng, you actually managed to break Lord Dugu Lingtian’s record. You sure are an amazing lad. It’s one thing if it’s any of the other trials, but you actually managed to do it for the Hidden Dragon Life Tower too!”

Li Muzhi’s grandfather, Li Fengxian, suddenly appeared out of nowhere. He looked at Chu Feng’s name, which was inscribed higher than Dugu Lingtian’s on the surface of the tower, and remarked deeply. There was a bright smile on his face.

“My life is quite resilient thanks to the blessing of the heavens,” Chu Feng joked.

“No matter what, it’s a good thing that you’re able to succeed. Chu Feng, I have two things to tell you. The first one is good news. The sectmaster has agreed to allow you to enter the Abandoned Land and marry Zi Ling,” Li Fengxian said.

“Really?”

Chu Feng was overjoyed. While this was indeed part of the agreement made with the sectmaster, he was still delighted when the matter was eventually confirmed. Given that the sectmaster bore ill-will toward him, there was no saying that she might continue to make things difficult for him.

The very reason why he entered the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was for Zi Ling. Just the thought that he would be able to see Zi Ling soon made him deeply overjoyed.

“What’s the other matter?” Chu Feng asked.

Based on how Li Fengxian had phrased it, the other matter seemed to be something bad.

“The second matter isn’t necessarily a bad thing. You do know that Yu Ting has been cultivating at my place thus far. It has been a while since she went into closed-door training. HOwever, just a moment ago, the sectmaster forcefully took her away with her,” Li Fengxian said.

“Took her away? Does the sectmaster intend to... punish her?” Li Muzhi asked worriedly.

“The sectmaster knows that Yu Ting has been at my place from the very start. If she intended to punish her, she would have done so right from the start. I reckon that it might have something to do with your betrothal with Zi Ling.

“The sectmaster has instructed you to enter the Abandoned Land four hours later. Zi Ling would probably need to make some preparations for the marriage too, and there’s no one more apt to help her other than Yu Ting,” Li Fengxian said.

Chu Feng agreed with Li Fengxian’s analysis.

“Oh? Where’s Brother Duan?” Chu Feng asked.

He was too overjoyed that he didn’t notice that Duan Liufeng wasn’t around. Zuoqiu Youyu wasn’t around too, but it was likely that he had stomped away angrily after noticing that Chu Feng had cleared Dugu Lingtian’s record.

“Elder Duan has matters to attend to,” Li Muzhi replied.

While Chu Feng didn’t know what those matters were, they had to be of extreme importance. Otherwise, given how concerned Duan Liufeng was of him, he would surely camp in the area and wait for him to come out.

But right now, Chu Feng was more concerned about Zi Ling. Just thinking about how he would be able to meet her four hours from now made him feel a little nervous.

It was an inconceivable emotion to him, but it made him feel like a human instead of a monster whose life only revolved around cultivation.

This was probably the most blissful thing about being born as a human.

Humans couldn’t control their emotions, but it was these uncontrollable emotions that gave rise to their humanity.

“Zi Ling, it has been so many years since we parted in the Lower Realm.”

Chu Feng began thinking about all of those past affairs. He was still a young lad when he first met Zi Ling, and Zi Ling was even younger than him. So many years had passed in a blink of an eye, and he had overcome countless trials and problems.

“Lord Hidden Dragon Elder, please bring me over in advance.”

Due to how anxious Chu Feng was, Li Fengxian brought Chu Feng over to the entrance of the Abandoned Land in advance. It was just that they still had to observe the sectmaster’s instruction and enter four hours later.

The entrance of the Abandoned Land was located beneath a mountain, and the area around the mountain looked incredibly barren. It wasn’t hard to imagine just how horrid of a place the real Abandoned Land was.

Chu Feng felt his heart pang when he thought that Zi Ling was living in such a place.

“Congratulations, Chu Feng. With this token in hand, you’ll be able to freely enter and leave the Abandoned Land,” Li Fengxian said as he passed a special token to Chu Feng.

Four hours had passed, and Chu Feng was finally able to enter the Abandoned Land to meet Zi Ling.

“Lord Hidden Dragon Elder, can I bring Zi Ling out with me?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m afraid I don’t have an answer to that question. You can try, but you won’t be able to bring Zi Ling out unless the sectmaster permits. It would be good if things work out,” Li Fengxian said.

“Thank you, Lord Hidden Dragon Elder.”

Chu Feng tucked the token by his waist before entering the Abandoned Land.

In order to give Zi Ling a surprise, he used a special means to conceal his body.

Entering the Abandoned Land, he found that it was indeed a barren and desolate region. It was a large world filled with stones, but all that could be seen were cliff faces made out of yellow sand. There wasn’t even weed growing in the region.

It didn’t take Chu Feng long to find Zi Ling. Yu Ting was in the area too, but the only one in his line of sight was Zi Ling.

Zi Ling was currently wearing the robe of the Hidden Dragon Disciples, but she didn’t look any different as she did back then. Many years had passed, but she was still as beautiful as ever. It was like time didn’t leave a mark on her at all.

She was so beautiful that Chu Feng felt his heartbeat quickening. A sour feeling rushed into his heart and squeezed his nose.

On the other hand, Zi Ling’s complexion didn’t look too good.

Chu Feng could tell why she was unhappy by eavesdropping on her conversation with Yu Ting.

Yu Ting had informed her that the sectmaster had found a fiance for her, and their marriage would be held today. It was just that Yu Ting didn’t know who the person was.

Zi Ling only had Chu Feng in her heart, so she was unwilling to get married to any other man.

“Zi Ling, it’s about time. What do you intend to do?” Yu Ting asked worriedly.

“I won’t agree to it no matter who he is. If he tries to force me, I’ll just have to end my life!” Zi Ling said.

“End your life? That isn’t good. How could I allow you to die?”

A voice suddenly sounded. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It was Chu Feng’s voice, but Zi Ling couldn’t tell as he had concealed it with his spirit power.

“Who is it?!”

Zi Ling quickly stood up and turned in the direction of the voice.

“Who else can I possibly be? I’m your fiance,” Chu Feng replied.

“I don’t know who you are, but I’m already married. Please return and tell my master that I won’t be marrying anyone,” Zi Ling said coldly.

“Young miss, don’t be too sure about that. Why do you know for sure that you’re unwilling to marry me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Heh...” Zi Ling sneered coldly. “Please leave now. I don’t wish to fight with you, but if you force my hand, I’ll have no choice.”

Clang!

Zi Ling took out a purple sword. It was an Exalted Armament. At the same time, she released her aura as well.

She was a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator.

It was just that her cultivation seemed to have stagnated ever since she entered the Abandoned Land.

While Chu Feng long knew about Zi Ling’s cultivation, he was still glad to see that she was able to reach such a level.

“Zi Ling, don’t be too sure about that. I haven’t shown myself yet, but I’m sure that you’ll leap right into my arms once I appear. Even if I wish to let go, I doubt that you would allow me to,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re seeking death!”

Zi Ling raised her sword and charged forth. Sword rays filled with killing intent burst forth toward Chu Feng’s direction.

Zi Ling was as fierce as ever. Her attacks weren’t just to intimidate. She was really intending to take his life with this attack.

It was only fortunate that Chu Feng’s cultivation had reached rank one Martial Exalted level now, or else that attack could have very well killed him.

After dodging the sword ray, Chu Feng continued on, “Chu Feng, why don’t you believe me? Since that’s the case, I guess I’ll have no choice but to put it to the test.”

By then, Chu Feng had already changed his voice back to his original one, which caused Zi Ling to freeze for a moment.

He stepped out from the shadows, revealing his true figure.

Both Zi Ling and Yu Ting were finally able to see Chu Feng.

“!!!”

The two of them were shocked to see him. They never thought that they would be able to see Chu Feng here.

“What’s wrong? You don’t recognize me...” Chu Feng teased.

Shoosh!

But before he could finish his words, a soft body carrying a light aroma had already leaped into his embrace.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I missed you a lot!”

Zi Ling hugged Chu Feng tightly.
