Chapter 5659: No Wonder You Need to Use an Alias

Dressed in a green robe, she looked young and beautiful despite not being a junior. She had long, slender legs and an amazing figure that highlighted her feminine charm. Even the blood flowing from her seven apertures hardly marred her beauty.

Most men wouldn’t be able to hold themselves back when faced with such a situation, but Chu Feng had self-control. He wouldn’t dare to carelessly touch this woman anyway, for he knew she was no ordinary woman.

She was Xia Xingchen, a member of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.

He had previously met her at the Ancient Realm. Back then, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had tried to flaunt in the Ancient Realm, only to be scorned and ridiculed by Xia Xingchen. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect refused to take the insult lying and even came to blows with Xia Xingchen, but they were unable to get the better of her.

Even though she looked to be only a few hundred years old, she was actually a True God level cultivator.

Due to her strength and enmity toward the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, Chu Feng had a good impression of her. It was just that he didn’t expect to meet her here. This also proved that he was in the Heavenly Dome Galaxy.

All of a sudden, there was a furious gale that shook the bamboo forest, though none of the bamboo trees were uprooted despite the strong winds.

Then, a sharp, feminine voice echoed from the ocean, “Stop hiding, Lord Xingchen. You can’t get away. You have already consumed my poison. Your cultivation will only continue to regress. You won’t be a match for me. You better obediently follow me back. Lord Sectmaster will surely forgive you given your talents.”

That was probably the person who had crossed blows with Xia Xingchen.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng quickly constructed a concealment formation around him and Xia Xingchen. He knew that the enemy would be able to quickly find them if she seriously looked for them, considering how she had to be a True God level cultivator too. He looked at Xia Xingchen, followed by the stone dagger next to her, and an idea came to his mind.

He picked up the stone dagger and quickly carried Xia Xingchen out of the bamboo forest.

…

Xia Xingchen woke up with a groggy head. She realized that her chest wasn’t hurting as much anymore because she was lying in a recovery formation.

“You’re awake,” a man’s voice echoed.

She quickly opened her eyes to take a look at who it was—it was Chu Feng. Her first reaction was to subdue Chu Feng, but a feeling of weakness prevented her from even stepping away from the recovery formation, let alone hurt him.

“Don’t waste your strength, elder. You consumed a poison pill that causes your cultivation to regress. You’ll only continue to grow weaker till its effects die down,” Chu Feng said.

Knowing that she was helpless, Xia Xingchen began assessing Chu Feng intently. Moments later, a glint flashed across her beautiful eyes. “I know you.”

“Yes, we met at the Ancient Realm,” Chu Feng replied.

“Yes, you’re that brat named Chu Feng, right? We didn’t really interact, but we should be considered acquaintances of sorts,” Xia Xingchen said with a grin. Her earlier wariness completely disappeared as if Chu Feng was an old friend.

However, she soon thought of something that made her expression stiffen. She looked at Chu Feng once more and asked, “Brat… you aren’t dead yet?”

She suddenly remembered how the Bluemoon Sacred Palace had invaded the Ancient Realm back then, and the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect didn’t have the strength to stop them. In the end, they were only able to take back their own prodigies and retreat.

Naturally, she thought that everyone else trapped in the Ancient Realm was a goner, including Chu Feng.

“Of course, I’m alive. Elder, I’m surprised you didn’t hear about me,” Chu Feng said.

Xia Xingcheng’s eyes lit up in interest. She looked at him with a smile as she asked, “Oh? What else happened to you? Tell me about it.”

“There’s quite a bit. If you’re curious, why don’t we exchange stories with each other? You can start by telling me why you’re being pursued by your clansmen,” Chu Feng said.

“Sure, but you have to first tell me how you got into our forbidden land,” Xia Xingchen replied.

Those words confirmed Chu Feng’s doubt that he had teleported from the Seven Realms Galaxy to the Heavenly Dome Galaxy. After all, the Heavenly Dome Galaxy couldn’t possibly construct their forbidden land on someone else’s territory. The other overlords wouldn’t allow it.

“Elder, I can tell you what you want to know, but I require your help for one matter,” Chu Feng said.

“Speak,” Xia Xingchen said.

“The stone hall inside the bamboo forest has a stone door that needs to be opened with a key. Elder, you have the key for that, right?”

“Aren’t you a bold one? Not only did you trespass on our forbidden land, but you want to enter the stone hall on top of that? But again, how did an outsider like you even get in there?”

“Elder, it looks like you really have the key. Will you help me to open the stone door then?”

“What do you think? Why in the world would I divulge the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s secrets to you?”

“But elder, aren’t you on bad terms with the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect now? There’s no reason for you to keep their secrets anymore. They tried to take your life earlier.”

Xia Xingchen looked at Chu Feng with contemplative eyes. All of a sudden, she thought of something and looked at him with narrowed eyes. “Brat, you didn’t take advantage of me while I was sleeping, right?”

Chu Feng quickly waved his hands and replied, “Elder, I am no longer the reckless youth I used to be. I won’t lay my hands on a defenseless woman.”

“Oi oi oi, what are you saying? I’m asking if you tried to feed me a poison pill or something while I was asleep. Also, what do you mean when you say that you aren’t the reckless youth you used to be? Are you saying that you took advantage of defenseless women before?” Xia Xingchen asked.

“I’m ashamed to admit that I have done such stuff before, but I’d like to assure you that I didn’t take advantage of you, and I didn’t feed you any poison pills either,” Chu Feng replied.

“Then why do you seem so confident that I’ll help you?” Xia Xingchen asked.

“Elder, there isn’t a need for me to poison you anymore now that your cultivation has regressed. I’m already able to pose a threat to you with my current strength,” Chu Feng replied.

“Are you threatening me now? You must be tired of living!” Xia Xingchen initially roared in anger, only to burst into laughter shortly after. “You’re interesting. You look more and more familiar the more I look at you. The way you speak resembles someone I know.”

“Like who?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Xuanyan. You know him?”

“Chu Xianyan? I’m afraid not.”

“What Chu Xianyan? It’s Chu Xuanyan!” Xia Xingchen said as she wrote out the three characters of his name.

Chu Feng had actually heard what Xia Xingchen said, but he intentionally got the name wrong to confirm if it was someone he knew. Chu Xuanyan was an alias his father had previously used in the Ancient Realm, after all.

“Elder, I do know of a person named Chu Xuanyan, but there are too many people with the same name out there. Why don’t you draw out the Chu Xuanyan you know, so that I can confirm if it’s the one I know?” Chu Feng asked.

Xia Xingchen quickly drew a portrait. It was indeed Chu Feng’s father, Chu Xuanyuan.

However, Chu Feng shook his head and replied, “Elder, I don’t know this person.”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Are you sure?” Xia Xingchen asked doubtfully. Her eyes alternated between the portrait and Chu Feng’s face as she murmured, “Why do the two of you look so alike? Is he your father?”

“Elder, the world of cultivation is huge. There are bound to be people out there who look identical despite having no blood ties. Don’t you think it’s rash to conclude that I’m his son just because we look a little alike?” Chu Feng said with an indignant voice.

“That’s true too,” Xia Xingchen agreed with a nod.

“Elder, are you friends with this Elder Chu Xuanyan?” Chu Feng asked.

“Friends? We’re enemies! That fellow is a bastard! He’s a scum far worse than you!” Xia Xingchen hollered.

“Elder, how can you say I look like someone like that? It might be thick-skinned of me to say this, but I do think I have a kind-looking face,” Chu Feng replied with an awkward smile. He was relieved that he didn’t tell the truth.

Father, you really made a lot of enemies. It’s no wonder you have to go around with an alias.
