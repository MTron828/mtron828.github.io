Chapter 2657 - Hidden Secret

“Seems like the Evil God Sword most definitely has some sort of secret that no one knew about,” Chu Feng thought in his heart.

Chu Feng felt that it was not that the Evil God Sword did not want to occupy his body. Rather, it was unable to do so.

As for the most likely reason why, it would be as he had guessed before, that the Evil God Sword was sealed in the weapon. Although the Evil God Sword possessed enormous power, it was unable to unleash it. In order to unleash its powers, it would need a medium. As for Chu Feng... he was that medium.

Time slowly passed. The screams from the Ginseng King of Evil grew softer and softer. In the end, its voice completely disappeared.

As for its enormous body that towered above the clouds, it too grew smaller and smaller, and also disappeared in the end.

The Ginseng King of Evil was completely devoured and refined by Chu Feng.

If they didn’t witness it with their very eyes, the crowd would not believe that a human’s body would be able to devour a colossus that reached over ten thousand meters tall and towered above the clouds.

At this moment, although the crowd was no longer screaming in panic like before, and everybody was standing in the sky in a strangely quiet manner, they were looking at Chu Feng with the same sort of fear-filled eyes that they looked at the Ginseng King of Evil with earlier.

In fact, the fear in their eyes was even a bit stronger.

“Boy, after devouring that thing, not only are you able to prolong your lifespan, but you are also able to be forever young now. For the rest of your life, your physical appearance will remain this young. You will not become an old man,” Finally, the Evil God Sword’s voice sounded again.

Merely, this voice from the Evil God Sword was spoken by the Evil God Sword, and not through Chu Feng’s mouth. It was a voice that only Chu Feng could hear.

“Oh, I nearly forgot. I shouldn’t have said you, but rather me. After all, this body is already no longer yours. Instead, it belongs to this Evil God now.”

The Evil God Sword’s voice sounded again. After hearing that voice, Chu Feng’s heart shivered.

The reason for that was because what the Evil God Sword said had revealed his scheme. Sure enough, it was not planning to return Chu Feng’s body.

However, as matters stood, there was nothing Chu Feng could do. He had already lost the power to contend for his body. At the very least, he could not contend for his body right now. He could only think of a way to do so in the future.

“I hope that you will honor your promise and not harm my friends,” Chu Feng said.

“Rest assured, this Evil God will definitely do as I’ve said. Since I’ve already promised you, I will definitely not harm them,” The Evil God Sword said.

“I have another request. Might you be able to go and ask that Chu Heavenly Clan’s old man where he obtained that scroll?” Chu Feng asked.

He wanted to know exactly where that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan found out that the Ginseng King of Evil was sealed here.

Logically, he should not know about this matter.

After all, not even the people from the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple knew exactly what it was that was sealed by the old cat, much less where it was sealed.

That should have been a secret. Thus, how did that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan obtain that information? In fact, he even knew the method to undo the seal, as well as what was sealed.

Chu Feng felt that there was most definitely a hidden secret to all this.

“This Evil God is able to satisfy that request of yours,” The Evil God Sword said.

“Woosh~~~”

After it finished saying those words, Chu Feng’s body moved, and he landed on the ground.

At that moment, a person was lying on the crater-filled surface. That person was none other than that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Merely, that Chu Heavenly Clan’s old man was now incomparably weak. He did not even possess the strength to fly.

That was why he crashed directly from the sky after the Ginseng King of Evil was refined by the Evil God Sword.

This existence that was high and above like a god looking down on all living things was only able to lie on the ground like a dying dog.

“How could this be?”

Chu Bore slowly raised his head. He took a glance at Chu Feng and then took a glance at the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman that had been following Chu Feng the entire time.

The Demon Armament Suppression Talisman was emitting that golden radiance the entire time. That golden radiance had been enveloping the Evil God Sword the entire time. However, it seemed that it was ineffective.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, the Evil God Sword extended Chu Feng’s left hand and grabbed at the air before it.

The next moment, that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman that was still emitting bright golden light landed on its hand.

He clenched his hand, and a ‘snap’ was heard. The Demon Armament Suppression Talisman was crushed to pieces.

At the same time that happened, the golden-bright and dazzling light started to dissipate.

“I understand now. So that thing was simply unable to suppress you to begin with,” Chu Bore laughed wryly.

“Where did you obtain that scroll?” The Evil God Sword asked.

“If I am to tell you the truth, will you spare my life?” Chu Bore asked.

The Evil God Sword did not answer Chu Bore. Instead, it said to Chu Feng, “Boy, you decide something like this.”

Chu Feng pondered for a moment. Then, he said, “Tell him to speak the truth.”

Compared to taking Chu Bore’s life, Chu Feng wanted to know where Chu Bore obtained that scroll more.

After receiving Chu Feng’s decision, the Evil God Sword said to Chu Bore, “Speak.”

“This old man has already reached the end of his allocated lifespan. I was only able to continue living till this day by using methods to extend my life. However, ordinary methods to extend one’s life have long since been unable to extend my life. Thus... I could only exhaust all means to find other methods of extending one’s life.”

“Finally, I discovered a person. I paid an enormous price, and bought that scroll from that person.”

“Merely, I do not know that person,” Chu Bore said.

“He’s not lying,” The Evil God Sword said to Chu Feng.

The Evil God Sword’s power of observation greatly surpassed Chu Feng’s. When it said that Chu Bore wasn’t lying, Chu Feng felt that Chu Bore most likely wasn’t lying.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had also paid attention to the reaction of that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan as he answered the question. With Chu Feng’s own perception, he too felt that the old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan had not lied.

After all, when faced with death, one’s heart would become extremely weak. If one were to attempt to lie at that time... it would be very easily discovered.

“Ask him where he found that person, as well as the characteristics that person possessed,” Chu Feng said.

“Where did you find that person? What are that person’s characteristics?” The Evil God Sword asked as Chu Feng requested.

“In the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Ghost Sect Hall. As for characteristics...” After saying those words, the old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan extended his hand with great difficulty. Then, he took out a picture scroll from his Cosmos Sack.

Upon opening the picture scroll, the image of a person could be seen.

That person was roughly three meters tall. However, they were very skinny, and wore a hood and a black gown.

However, that hood was not on that person’s head. Thus, one could see that person’s face.

That person had a very frightening appearance. To be exact, that person did not resemble a human. Rather, their appearance resembled that of a monstrous beast.

That person had a very thin face. Yet, it was also very fierce. The left half of the face was normal. However, there was an enormous scar on the right half of the face. That scar was somewhat scary-looking. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

That scar resembled a giant centipede on his face. Passing over their right eye. It ooked truly disgusting.

That person’s right eye was green. Thus, it was most likely not his eye. Rather, it resembled a monstrous beast’s eye.
