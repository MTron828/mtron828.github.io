Chapter 4043 - Wuming Doutian

“What’s wrong? Scared?”

“Didn’t you all want to kill my clan chief earlier? That didn’t seem to be a show to me.”

“Even if you’re all scared now, it’ll still be useless. We must settle this debt properly,” Chu Feng said to the Wuming Clansmen.

“Chu Feng, what do you want?”

One of the Wuming Clan’s Six Great Utmost Exalteds asked.

“I want his life.” Chu Feng pointed to Wuming Fenghong.

“You!”

The Wuming Clansmen all turned pale with fright upon hearing those words.

They had not expected that Chu Feng would be so tyrannical.

Even if Wuming Fenghong had thought about killing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he had not actually killed him.

Yet, Chu Feng was determined to kill Wuming Fenghong just because of that. That was simply too overbearing, too tyrannical.

“Chu Feng, you yourself know best as to exactly what you and your clan are capable of.”

“We are not attacking you not because we fear you. Rather, it’s because we are giving face to the Three Cities.”

“You’d best act tactfully, and drop this subject.”

“If you insist on forcing your way with your words, your behavior will be seen as that of an individual incapable of differentiating good from bad.”

Another old man from the Wuming Clan spoke with a cold voice.

He too was one of the Six Great Utmost Exalteds. His name was Wuming Zhenkong.

That Wuming Zhenkong had a very robust build and a fierce look. Whether it was his appearance, his reputation or his status, he was superior to Wuming Fenghong.

Back when the Wuming Clan had ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Wuming Zhenkong was the person most renowned for his might apart from their clan chief, the Starfield Master Realm’s master, Wuming Doutian.

Wuming Zhenkong had not uttered a single word the entire time.

However, after he spoke the crowd present became frightened.

Even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was sending voice transmissions to Chu Feng, urging him not to argue with Wuming Zhenkong.

However, Chu Feng was the person who knew his current capabilities the best.

When even Tuoba Chengan who’d been backing the Linghu Heavenly Clan had easily been killed by him, how could Chu Feng possibly fear the Wuming Clan who had fled from the Linghu Heavenly Clan after their defeat?

“This is truly a twist of words and a force of logic, a sophistry I say.”

“The ones being overbearing were clearly you all. Yet now, you’re saying that we are unable to differentiate good from bad?”

“Well, think whatever you want. Even if I am being overbearing, I, Chu Feng, still insist on an explanation for the matters here today.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he began walking towards the Wuming Clan.

“Chu Feng, return at once!”

“Chu Feng, do not be rude!”

Seeing that their voice transmissions were useless, many Chu Heavenly Clansmen began to openly shout at Chu Feng.

In fact, there were people among the Chu Heavenly Clansmen proclaiming that he was being rude.

However, no matter what they said, Chu Feng had no intention of backing off. He continued to walk towards the Wuming Clan step by step.

“Milord, what are we to do about this?”

Seeing that Chu Feng was really approaching them, the experts of the Wuming Clan began to panic.

Had it been before, they would’ve killed him already.

However, the situation at hand was different. They were afraid of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City and, by extension, afraid of Chu Feng.

Facing Chu Feng who was demanding an explanation, they truly did not know what to do.

“What’s there to fear? He’s but a person of the younger generation.”

“If he dares to approach, confine him with oppressive might.”

Even though Wuming Zhenkong said those words with a firm tone, he only dared to order Chu Feng’s confinement, and did not dare to unleash punishment on him. This was not his style at all.

As such, once he said those words, those that knew Wuming Zhenkong well knew that their lord, who was famed for his despotic behavior, was actually also panicking when facing Chu Feng.

No matter how strong-willed they appeared, it remained an incontestable truth that the Wuming Clan was being threatened by Chu Feng.

Everyone remembered this scene.

However, many people did not believe Chu Feng to be the impressive one.

Rather, they all felt that he was taking advantage of his position to bully others.

“Young friend Chu Feng truly possesses a stubborn nature. As expected of Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

Suddenly, a voice sounded from afar.

That voice was not very loud. Yet, it shook the crowd’s minds the moment it entered their ears.

Looking toward the direction of the voice, the crowd’s expressions all changed.

The people from the Wuming Clan were pleased beyond their expectations, whereas the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all shivering in fear.

As for the others, they all grew tense.

At that moment, practically no one was able to remain undisturbed because of the appearance of that individual.

In fact, even the surrounding region itself seemed to have undergone an enormous change.

It was as if everything in the area had yielded themselves to that person.

The person that had arrived was a man.

That man had a middle-aged appearance. However, he had a head of white hair.

That white hair did not resemble natural white hair grown from one’s scalp. Rather, it seemed like hair that had turned white from experiencing an endless amount of time.

His long white hair sprinkled down his back. As he moved, his hair fluttered in the air and appeared very majestic.

Yet, contrasting the beauty of the white hair, the man gave off an intense air of masculinity.

No, to be exact, it was a sort of air that he gave off, the air of a ruler.

That man was someone who possessed the airs of a ruler.

The instant the man was seen, the Wuming Clansmen and even the other powers present all knelt before him.

In fact, many Chu Heavenly Clansmen were so terrified by him that they too knelt.

The reason for that was all because the man possessed a truly enormous background.

He was the person who had ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield for countless years, the master of the Starfield Master Realm, the Wuming Clan’s Clan Chief, Wuming Doutian.

“So he’s Wuming Doutian.”

Chu Feng’s gaze became complicated when he saw Wuming Doutian.

It was the first time Chu Feng had met him.

Yet, Chu Feng had heard his name countless times.

That man was the person who had ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield for over ten thousand years.

He was the one who had forced his grandfather to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

He was also the man who had forced his father to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield as well.

In fact, it was also because of him that Chu Feng had been sent to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

Chu Feng had been living beneath the shadow of that man the entire time.

Before Chu Feng’s rise to power, not to mention Wuming Doutian, the Wuming Clan itself had been a giant mountain.

It was a giant mountain that had crushed Chu Feng to a state of being unable to breathe.

As for Wuming Doutian, he stood at the summit of that mountain. He was the person who brought the greatest pressure to Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng had not even been qualified to meet him.

It was all because Chu Feng had been too small and weak.

However, things were no longer the same.

The current Chu Feng was a completely different individual that he was in the past. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Even though it was their first time meeting, Chu Feng was already able to keep his calm facing the Starfield Master Realm’s master.

In fact, Chu Feng’s blood was boiling. Excitement was rising in his heart.

“We’ve finally met.”

Chu Feng spoke. There was no trace of anger on his face. Rather, he was smiling.

Chu Feng felt that it was most appropriate to meet Wuming Doutian there.

Regardless of whether it be the grudges of his father and grandfather or his own, he would be able to settle them all.

“Indeed, we’ve finally met.”

“Perhaps it might be our first meeting for you.”

“However, I’ve actually already met you before. Merely, at that time, you were only an infant.”

“To be exact, you were an infant incapable of cultivation.”

“It is truly impossible to grasp the workings of the world. At that time, no one would’ve imagined that the infant despised by everyone, the infant that had been abandoned by his clan, would attain today’s level of achievement.”

“In the end, you’ve not disappointed your father.”

A previously unimaginable scene occurred.

Wuming Doutian, known for his arrogance and despotic behavior, was actually not attacking the arrogant and despotic Chu Feng.

Instead, with a smile on his face, he praised Chu Feng.

This scene puzzled everyone. However, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen still felt worried.

They had no idea what sort of trick Wuming Doutian had up his sleeve.

However, they knew that he was most definitely not easy to talk to.

He was the most arrogant and despotic individual in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield!
