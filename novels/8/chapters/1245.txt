MGA: Chapter 1246 - Oppression

Qin Lingyun’s words truly came as a surprise to the crowd. It was not only Tao Xiangyu and the others that were surprised, even Bai Ruochen was surprised.

However, Bai Ruochen still replied with a cold attitude, “I do, what about it?”

“Which Imperial Clan are you from?” Qin Lingyun asked again.

“Is this any of your business?” Bai Ruochen became a bit annoyed.

“Speak!!!!!!” However, who would’ve thought that Qin Lingyun’s expression would suddenly change, and that he would actually snarl at her. His oppressive might descended on Bai Ruochen, causing her to be unable to fly in the sky, and smashing her into the ground ruthlessly.

“Wuuwaa~~~~~” The enormous impact left a giant crater behind. A trace of blood flowed from the corner of Bai Ruochen’s mouth.

However, this was not enough to make Bai Ruochen surrender. She gathered her strength to prop herself back up. After that, she activated her Imperial Bloodline; she was planning to counterattack.

“Puuu~~~~~~”

However, right after Bai Ruochen stood back up, Qin Lingyun’s oppressive might came crushing down on her once again, forcing her to kneel to the ground. Even though Bai Ruochen was striving to get back up, she was simply unable to do so.

“You bastard.”

To see Bai Ruochen being beaten down in such a manner, how could Chu Feng possibly do nothing? Lightning emerged, and his cultivation instantly increased to rank five Martial King. With a flip of his palm, the Demon Sealing Sword appeared in his hand.

After he reached his peak condition, Chu Feng’s body moved and charged toward Qin Lingyun.

At the same time Chu Feng launched his attack, Her Lady Queen Eggy also burst forward. Furthermore, in order to prevent Chu Feng from being injured, her speed surpassed Chu Feng’s, coming before him to attack Qin Lingyun first.

“Humph.”

When faced with Chu Feng and Eggy’s incoming attack, Qin Lingyun merely snorted coldly. Then, with a wave of his sleeve, a boundless oppressive might swept across the horizon and toward Chu Feng and Eggy.

That oppressive might was extraordinarily fierce. Furthermore, it was extremely fast. Even though it did not contain any martial power, it was not something that Eggy and Chu Feng could withstand.

In an instant, Chu Feng felt a great amount of gravity smashing into him like a mountain. As his vision blurred, his body lost its balance and, like a sandbag, he fell from the sky, crashing into the ground.

After he crashed onto the ground, Chu Feng created a crater like Bai Ruochen. However, Chu Feng did not vomit any blood. Instead, he was relatively undamaged.

However, Chu Feng felt the same amount of pressure as Bai Ruochen. With that pressure pressing down on his back, Chu Feng was unable to stand back up.

“You piece of shit, release this Queen!”

At this moment, Eggy’s angry voice suddenly sounded. Using his Heaven’s Eyes to see, Chu Feng discovered that Eggy was also suppressed to a large crater on the ground, unable to move at all.

At this moment, Chu Feng was unable to endure it anymore and began to shout angrily. “Qin Lingyun, if there’s something that you want, then come at me, Chu Feng. To bully women, what sort of man are you?”

To his surprise, Qin Lingyun ignored him completely, and ignored Eggy as well. Even though the two of them were cursing at him, he ignored them completely. Instead, he turned his gaze to Bai Ruochen who was kneeling on the ground, “I’ll ask you again, which Imperial Clan are you from?”

“Pah!~~” Bai Ruochen did not respond and instead spit a mouthful of saliva onto the ground.

“You truly are one to refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit,”[1. I.E., I ask you nicely but you refuse, now I’ll make you do it with punishment.] Seeing Bai Ruochen’s reaction, Qin Lingyun was enraged.

With a point of his finger, martial power surged forth. In an instant, his martial power turned into a hundred sharp and thin needles.

Those needles were truly thin, so thin that they were like thread. However, those needles were extremely long, each and every one of them was a meter long. At this moment, they flew down like a rainstown. Finally, with “pu,pu,pu,pu,pu,pu” sounds, the needles pierced into Bai Ruochen’s body.

“Ahhhh~~~~~~~~~~~”

Having the needles pierced into her body was a pain so strong that it even shook her heart. Bai Ruochen was unable to endure the pain and cried incomparably miserable screams.

“Qin Lingyun, I’ll kill you!!!!!!!!”

At this moment, Chu Feng was at the limit of his anger. Not only were his clenching fists emitting creaking sounds, even his teeth were grinding as he gnashed on them. However, Qin Lingyun’s oppressive might was like an invisible mountain crushing down on him, making him incapable of budging.

Powerless, he was totally powerless. Even though he was so enraged that he could eat someone, even though he had the determination to kill his opponent, he was unable to even launch an attack.

At this moment, Chu Feng realized the disparity between him and Qin Lingyun. At the very least, the current disparity of their strength was as great as the heaven from earth.

This was the strength of the Cyanwood Mountain’s strongest disciple. Chu Feng had no choice but to admit that the current him was no match for Qin Lingyun.

As for Qin Lingyun, he completely ignored Chu Feng’s reaction. He lightly hooked his finger, and numerous droplets of blood began to fly about in all directions. Those hundred thin needles formed by his martial power were pulled out of Bai Ruochen’s body.

With a flip of his wrist, those needles began to change. From a hundred needles, they turned into a thousand needles.

“Will you speak now?” Qin Lingyun asked again. However, one could hear the faint trace of anger from his current tone.

“If you have the guts, then kill me,” Bai Ruochen shouted. She refused to yield.

“I’ll grant you your wish to die!!!” Qin Lingyu did not show any mercy. With a movement of his finger, the thousand thin needles all flew downward toward Bai Ruochen simultaneously.

This scene was truly too ruthless. There were some people who were incapable of continuing to watch and, either closed their eyes or turned their heads around. However, there were also people who were watching the scene with great interest. As for Tao Xiangyu and the others, they were even smiling. They were truly eager for Qin Lingyun to kill Bai Ruochen.

“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang...” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, right at the moment when those thin needles were about to pierce into Bai Ruochen’s body, they suddenly exploded and turned into a bunch of disorderly martial power before dissipating.

“What’s going on?”

Many people were shocked by this scene. Many more people turned their gazes to Qin Lingyun. They felt that Qin Lingyun had stopped his attack at the most crucial moment, that he was only scaring Bai Ruochen, and that he did not have the intention to actually kill her.

“Junior sister Jiang, why did you stop me?” To everyone’s surprise, Qin Lingyun started to frown, and looked behind Bai Ruochen.

“Buzz.” At this moment, the space behind Bai Ruochen trembled faintly. Soon, a female appeared before everyone’s line of sight.

It was a beautiful woman. Even though she could not be considered to be a stunning beauty, she possessed a special sort of mature air to her.

“It’s really her?” When he saw this woman, Chu Feng was startled. That was because this woman was the same woman that he had encountered in the Firmament Medicine Garden.

“Jiang Furong?”

“She also came?”

When they saw this woman, Tao Xiangyu and the others began to frown, and unease began to appear on their faces.

One must know that this Jiang Furong was no ordinary character. Not only was she ranked third on the Cyanwood Succession List, she was also a Divine Body. Furthermore, it was said that her origin was extremely mysterious, and that both she herself and her family were extremely powerful. Even someone like Qin Lingyun would have to give her face.
