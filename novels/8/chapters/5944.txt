Chapter 5945: Framing

“Yun’er, what nonsense are you spouting?” Lord Nine Demons roared sternly.

“I said I was the one who killed them,” Song Yun repeated herself.

“Nonsense! Do you know killing your fellow sectmembers warrants capital punishment?”

“I know, but they were the ones who tried to kill me first. I was merely protecting myself.”

“How would they have the guts to kill you?”

“They wanted to take advantage of me. They tried to poison me. I discovered their ploy and went on a rampage, killing all of them. I know you think that my reason is ridiculous, but that is the truth. I won’t try to justify what I did. You can punish me by sect rules. However, I request to enter the Demon Netherworld Tower. I have the right to do so,” Song Yun said.

“This...” The Netherworld Generals present panicked.

When highly-talented or high-ranking Netherworld Sectmembers committed a major crime, they could instead opt to enter the Demon Netherworld Tower. That was a place left behind by the Netherworld Sect’s founder.

As long as one could walk out of the Demon Netherworld Tower alive, one’s crimes would be erased, no matter how major they were. However, not a single person to date had survived the Demon Netherworld Tower.

Entering the Demon Netherworld Tower was as good as being sentenced to death.

Song Yun didn’t look like she was kidding.

Seeing how determined she was, Lord Nine Demons sent her a voice transmission, “Yun’er, there’s no need for you to do this for Chu Feng. Change your words now and say that you’re just taking the blame for Chu Feng. I’ll ensure your safety.”

“But I’m the one who did it,” Song Yun replied via voice transmission.

“You lass! You are usually sharp-witted; why are you being so foolish today? Don’t you get what I’m trying to say? I’m saying that you can push the blame to Chu Feng even if you were the one who did it!” Lord Nine Demons exclaimed.

“I am the one who did it. I know the sect rules, but I don’t think I have done wrong, so I’d like to enter the Demon Netherworld Tower,” Song Yun spoke aloud.

Lord Nine Demons’ face darkened, but he chose not to say a word. He could tell that Song Yun was serious about this, and there was nothing he could say that would change her mind.

“Song Yun, you may enter the Demon Netherworld Sect, but for now, you’re a criminal who killed your fellow sectmembers. Men, capture Song Yun,” Lord Nine Demons ordered.

“Lord Nine Demons, Miss Song Yun...” The present Netherworld Generals tried to plead on Song Yun’s behalf.

They knew that Song Yun was one of the most talented in the Netherworld Sect, and there was a bright future ahead of her. They couldn’t bear to see a mishap befalling her.

“Imprison her,” Lord Nine Demons bellowed.

The Netherworld General had no choice but to apprehend Song Yun and escort her out.

Before Song Yun left, she flashed a smile at Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Two. That smile sent shivers down the latter’s spine. He had never seen such a gaze, even from old monsters.

“You, stay behind. The others, get out.” Lord Nine Demons only kept his aide, the Demon-tier Netherworld General, in the room.

“Milord.”

The aide returned Lord Nine Demons’ token, thinking there was no reason to go after Chu Feng since Song Yun had already admitted to the crime. The Netherworld Sect needed justification to make a move, even when dealing with outsiders.

However, Lord Nine Demons looked at his aide and said, “Hunt him down.”

“Milord, are you going after Chu Feng for those Immortal Slaughterers? Chu Feng is no ordinary person. It could lead to implications...” the aide voiced his confusion.

“Immortal Slaughterer isn’t worthy,” Lord Nine Demons said.

That deepened the aide’s confusion. “Didn’t Miss Song Yun say that he didn’t do it?”

“Now that Song Yun is imprisoned, if more victims emerge, the culprit can only be Chu Feng,” Lord Nine Demons said.

“Milord, you mean...” The aide was stunned.

It was obvious that Lord Nine Demons wanted to frame Chu Feng for this matter, but that would mean that they had to kill one of their own.

Just then, Lord Nine Demons placed his palm on the aide’s shoulder. It looked to be a gentle touch, but there was extreme force behind it that the aide’s heart skipped a beat.

“I heard that Chu Feng has conquered the legendary Genesis Bloodline. I’d like to see if it’s true or not. Mobilize our people to capture him. I want him alive. You can do that, right?” Lord Nine Demons calmly looked at his aide.

“I understand.” The aide nodded before heading out.

He knew he had to accomplish this task well, or else he would be the one dead.

...

Meanwhile, Chu Feng arrived at the teleportation formation.

It was discreet, but he could tell from some signs that it had been sealed off. He immediately turned around and left, not bothering to even probe the formation. He knew that it was a trap, and someone was probably waiting in ambush.

I won’t be able to leave via this teleportation formation anymore.

“It’s troublesome that I got discovered so quickly.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Chu Feng first left the area before ascending as high as possible into the sky. He took out a map of this realm and inspected it while examining the realm itself with his Heaven’s Eyes to check for disparities. Using the information he gathered, he constructed an even more accurate model of the realm with his spirit power.

Then, he took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

“Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, this matter concerns my survival. You have to help me. Please show me all of the superior concealment terrain in this realm,” Chu Feng said as he tried to activate the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk unleashed many surges of aura on the model.

Chu Feng had already found many superior concealment terrains with his Heaven’s Eyes, and the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk’s guidance reflected results similar to his observation. He closely studied the realm before he stowed away the map and left.

However, he didn’t make his way to any of the superior concealment terrain.

The Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s sealing formation was formidable and it hadn’t unraveled yet. There was no way for him to leave this realm other than via their teleportation formation, but that option was now out of the question too.

However, there was still a sliver of hope.

The Immortal Sea Fish Clan should soon notice that the Netherworld Sect was camping in Bluesnow Upper Realm instead and dispatch their men to rescue him.

That being said, the fact that they weren’t here yet meant that they had their hands tied. The explosions from the neighboring Littlelight Upper Realm hadn’t ceased ever since he arrived here. Littlelight Upper Realm must have been a trap for Xianhai Shiyue and the others. It would be lucky if they could escape from that trap alive, let alone reinforce him.

After all, the Netherworld Sect did come prepared.

The Netherworld Sect should have found out that he was on Bluesnow Upper Realm by now.

If they realized that Little Fishy was missing on top of that, they might just seal off Bluesnow Upper Realm on their side too. Even worse, they could construct detection formations targeted at Little Fishy to track them down.

Chu Feng had to take countermeasures, but he wasn’t confident of doing so.

The Netherworld Sect definitely had True Dragon World Spiritists here. The huge gap in the spirit power between him and his enemies was not something he could bridge with just skills.

Even so, he still had to give it a try.

“Let’s hope that luck is on my side, and the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s reinforcement arrives earlier.”

Chu Feng planned to construct a concealment formation, in hopes that it would elude the Netherworld Sect’s detection, and pray that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s reinforcement arrived as soon as possible.

Xianhai Shiyue’s army might have their hands tied up at the moment, but they would have sent out a distress call when they realized that they had fallen into a trap. Given that they were in the Immortal Sea Galaxy, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s turf, it shouldn’t take long for reinforcements to arrive.

Chu Feng just had to hold on till then.

After some traveling, Chu Feng arrived at his destination. This was not the place with the most superior concealment terrain, but it was suitable for constructing formations.

It was true that camping at places with superior concealment terrain would amplify the prowess of his concealment formation, allowing him to better elude the enemy’s detection.

However, if the enemy had a True Dragon World Spiritist, they would know which places had superior concealment terrain too. Those would likely be the first few places they would check after activating their detection formation. Thus, Chu Feng had to opt for other locations.

He quickly began constructing his formation, but he stopped right as it was about to be completed. He was biding his time.
