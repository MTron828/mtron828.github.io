Chapter 4230 - Expectation

“Senior, why is Lu Jie’s name on that flag?” Chu Feng voiced his curiosity.

He felt that Grandmaster Tang Chen should know the reason why.

Chu Feng noticed that Yuan Shu had a clear change in expression the moment Chu Feng asked that question.

Grandmaster Tang Chen was also slightly affected by his question.

Because of that, Chu Feng realized that the flag could very well have something to do with Lu Jie.

“That was something that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s disciple Lu Jie left behind,” answered Grandmaster Tang Chen.

As Chu Feng had expected, it was the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s disciple, Lu Jie.

“Apart from the Compliance Mirror, there’s another mystical device in the Ancient Compliance Castle called the Talent Steps.”

“The Talent Steps have a total of three steps. Only those with exceptional talent in world spirit techniques would be able to ascend the Talent Steps.”

“Should one be able to stand on the Talent Steps for an incense stick’s worth of time, it would mean that one possesses exceptional talent.”

“Lu Jie is the only person that has managed to remain standing on the Talent Steps so far.”

“He stood on the first step and remained there for an entire incense stick’s worth of time.”

“Whenever the Ancient Compliance Castle opens, three flags will be raised.”

“In the past, all three flags were blank. No one had thought about the implication of the flags. We’d all thought that they were merely decorative.”

“But, ever since Lu Jie had successfully remained on the Talent Steps’s first step, his name had appeared on the first flag.”

“That was also the day that Lu Jie was deemed to be the most promising world spiritist of the younger generation in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.”

“After all, he had displayed his incomparable talent,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“It would seem that Lu Jie has some ability.”

Lu Jie had accomplished what was impossible for others.

Chu Feng knew that what Lu Jie had done was an enormously glorious act.

Because of that, an idea appeared in his heart.

He wanted to leave his name on the Ancient Compliance Castle’s flags.

Leaving his name would be akin to conquering a treasure of the Ancient Era.

To Chu Feng, it would also be an enormously glorious act should he be able to accomplish that.

“What must I do to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle?” Yu Ting asked all of a sudden.

Yu Ting was a young woman of few words. Apart from the several times that she would initiate conversations with Chu Feng, she would rarely speak.

This was the first time that she had initiated a conversation with someone beside Chu Feng in the past several days.

Because of that, even Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu were surprised.

Their shock only grew greater when they looked at Yu Ting and saw the current expression in her eyes.

They did not know Yu Ting well, and had not thought about bothering to know her well either. They only knew that she was Chu Feng’s friend.

However, at that moment they suddenly realized that the quiet young woman was not that simple of a girl.

Her eyes were filled with fighting spirit and ambition.

“Young lady, could it be that you also want to leave your name on the flags?” Grandmaster Tang Chen asked with a smile.

He spoke those words in a slightly joking manner.

Whilst he was surprised, he did not have much expectation for Yu Ting.

“I merely want to see how far my talent can reach,” said Yu Ting.

“Young lady, it’s very easy to enter. The spirit formation gate is about to open.”

“But, you’ll have to pass a test in order to step onto the Talent Steps.”

“As long as you can pass the test, you’ll be able to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle.”

“That said, even if you fail to pass the test, you will not receive any harm from it,” said Yuan Shu.

After saying those words, he looked at Chu Feng. “Brother Chu Feng, since there’s still some time before the opening of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain, why don’t we enter the Ancient Compliance Castle to have a look?”

“Chu Feng, you should go and check it out. It’s not that easy to meet Old Man Compliance,” added Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Although they were surprised by Yu Ting’s desire to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle, they still placed high hopes on Chu Feng.

Both Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu wanted to know what sort of commotion Chu Feng would cause should he enter the Ancient Compliance Castle.

Perhaps he might even leave his name on the second flag.

If Chu Feng was able to raise such a commotion at such a gathering, it would be for the best. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This would be the best opportunity for Chu Feng to make a name for himself.

“Buzz---”

Right at that moment, countless spirit formation gates appeared outside the Ancient Compliance Castle.

They were numerous, and close together. There were simply too many to count.

At that moment, the people gathered around the Ancient Compliance Castle began flying towards those spirit formation gates.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that the spirit formation gates would change somewhat the moment a single person stepped into it.

The spirit formation gates did not disappear. But, they would close. No one else would be able to enter them.

In other words, a single spirit formation gate would only allow a single person to enter.

Chu Feng felt that there was simply no need for everyone to scramble for the spirit formation gates.

The Ancient Compliance Castle was enormous. All around its enormous body were spirit formation gates.

The number of spirit formation gates numbered in the tens of thousands. They were more than sufficient for everyone present.

“Yoh, there are actually some familiar faces.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng noticed some familiar people from the crowd rushing to enter the spirit formation gates.

They were Yue Yang and Chen Guang. They were the two genius world spiritists that had been helping Long Xiaoxiao breach the remnant left behind by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, who had ended up being plotted against and forced out of the remnant by the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

Seeing their current vigorous and lively expressions, it appeared that their injuries had completely healed.

“He actually dared to come here still?!”

At that moment, Yuan Shu’s gaze turned ice-cold.

He also noticed a familiar figure Li Fengxue.

Li Fengxue, Yue Yang and Chen Guang were all rushing toward the Ancient Compliance Castle.

Right after Yuan Shu noticed Li Fengxue, Li Fengxue entered a spirit formation gate.

The reason for Yuan Shu’s extreme anger upon seeing Li Fengxue was naturally because of what had happened that day.

Li Fengxue’s master, Revered Master Beast Tamer, had hidden Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects inside the two Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain that he had handed to Chu Feng.

If it hadn’t been for Chu Feng’s bloodline being powerful enough to refine the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects, those insects would’ve taken Chu Feng’s life.

The fact that Li Fengxue was there meant that his master must also be here.

“It’s perfect that they came. After all, this old man was planning to find them to settle that debt.” Grandmaster Tang Chen said indifferently.

Compared to Yuan Shu, Grandmaster Tang Chen reacted very calmly.

“Master, perhaps I should stay and help you find that Revered Master Beast Tamer,” said Yuan Shu.

“What use is there in you staying? Go ahead and accompany Chu Feng and that young lady,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Yes, Master.”

Yuan Shu nodded. Then, he looked to Chu Feng.

As Chu Feng did not say anything, Yuan Shu didn’t know if he was planning to enter.

“This Ancient Compliance Castle is truly awe-inspiring. I also want to witness the interior of this castle.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he flew towards the Ancient Compliance Castle.

Seeing that, Yu Ting and Yuan Shu also followed.

Soon, the three of them had disappeared into three separate spirit formation gates.

After seeing them disappear into the spirit formation gates, Grandmaster Tang Chen looked around. A smile of expectation had appeared on his face.

After seeing the world spiritists present, the smile on his face grew even more concentrated.

“Everyone, let us quietly wait. You will all soon be astonished.”

“You all will soon realize who is the most talented world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy.”

“After today, you will all remember that name.”

“And one day, you will learn whose disciple he is,” Grandmaster Tang Chen said quietly. The tone of his voice was one filled with expectation.

Although no one heard his words, he knew that what he’d said would definitely come true.

He was waiting to see the looks of astonishment on those people’s faces.
