Chapter 4025 - The World Spiritist’s Bloodline

“Oh?”

Hearing his master’s words, Yuan Shu realized that the spirit formation was most definitely very difficult to breach. He knew for certain that it was not as simple as it appeared.

That said, he still had no idea exactly how powerful his master’s spirit formation was.

It was only when he looked at the spirit formation gate and saw the scene displayed by it that he realized how terrifying of a spirit formation it was.

An overwhelming power had soared into the sky from the collapsed earth.

Even though Yuan Shu was still unable to see exactly what it was, the imposing power emitted by whatever it was was enough to shake his heart.

Staring at the spirit formation gate, Yuan Shu finally saw something appearing from the depths beneath the ground.

There were seven enormous sculptures.

The seven enormous sculptures stood tall around Chu Feng, surrounding him.

The seven sculptures rose rapidly from beneath the earth, and soon extended past the clouds.

When the sculptures were fully in view, Yuan Shu was unable to keep himself from gasping in admiration.

Those sculptures were simply too enormous. Even the vast clouds that filled the sky could only float beneath them.

They were so enormous that it seemed like they were about to leave the world and enter the vast Outer World.

Although the height of the sculptures were the same, their appearances were different.

They were respectively... a monster, a demon, an immortal, a buddha, a ghost, a beast, and an Asura... the appearance of seven world spirits.

[1. I believe FBT originally translated the seven spirit worlds as Beast, Elf, Ghost, Fairy, Buddha, Demon and Asura. I think Monster should be Elf and Immortal should be Fairy?]

The powerful aura Yuan Shu had felt earlier, was from those seven world spirit sculptures.

Suddenly, a violent wind swept through the sky above. The wind was so powerful that it was simply capable of destroying an entire region.

The wind had been caused by the seven world spirit sculptures.

Those seven sculptures were moving.

As they moved, their bodies began to change.

Countless crushed stones began to peel away from their bodies. Like a meteor shower, those stones came crashing down from above.

When those crushed stones peeled off, the real world spirits appeared.

It turned out that they were not sculptures, but rather actual beings.

Even though Yuan Shu knew that they had been created by Grandmaster Tang Chen’s spirit formation, they were still living beings, and existences akin to gods in that spirit formation.

Even though Yuan Shu stood outside the spirit formation, he was still able to sense how overwhelmingly powerful those seven world spirits were. Even he felt that he was extremely small and insignificant.

“Master, how exactly is brother Chu Feng supposed to breach such a spirit formation?” Yuan Shu asked his master.

The reason why Yuan Shu asked that question was because he had realized that those seven world spirits all had ill intentions. Their target was none other than Chu Feng.

With how overwhelmingly powerful those seven world spirits were, how exactly was Chu Feng supposed to take them on?

This was simply a confrontation with a predetermined ending.

“If it were easy to breach, it wouldn’t be a spirit formation I spent meticulous effort setting up no?” asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“But... isn’t this a bit too excessive?” asked Yuan Shu.

“Rest assured, this spirit formation will not take his life. However, if he is unable to breach it, he will inevitably be taught a lesson.”

“This will also serve to show that Ox-nose that this old man is serious about the bet.”

Grandmaster Tang Chen was brimming with confidence as he said those words.

He had absolute confidence in his spirit formation.

His confidence indicated that Chu Feng would inevitably fail.

The reason why he was there watching everything was so that he could personally witness Chu Feng’s failure and appreciate his outstanding work.

Sigh...

Seeing his master behaving like that, Yuan Shu felt rather helpless.

He was unable to change anything. Thus, he turned his gaze back to the grand formation.

Even though he already knew that those seven world spirits would attack Chu Feng, he still wanted to see what sort of scene would emerge when they did so.

“Roar~~~”

The seven world spirits opened their mouths at the same time.

Once they opened their mouths, wind and clouds began to move rapidly. Even space itself moved.

It was suction. A boundless suction was being emitted from their mouths and toward Chu Feng.

Being enveloped by the suction, Chu Feng began to change.

Not only were Chu Feng’s clothes frantically fluttering, but a special sort of gas also appeared on his body.

That gas was emitted from within Chu Feng. Following the boundless suction, the gas split into seven and entered the mouths of the seven world spirits.

With the situation like that, Chu Feng, although still having his eyes closed, frowned with an expression of pain. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It was as if some indispensable power was being forcibly extracted from him.

“Master, what is that gas extracted from brother Chu Feng’s body?”

Yuan Shu had a nervous look on his face as he hurriedly asked his master.

He was worried for Chu Feng.

“Don’t panic. He’s Ox-nose’s disciple, I wouldn’t possibly kill him,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“But, why does that gas resemble one’s soul so much?” asked Yuan Shu.

“That’s not soul. Rather, it’s bloodline,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Bloodline?”

“You’re saying that brother Chu Feng has an inherited bloodline for world spirit techniques?” asked Yuan Shu.

“That’s right,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Yuan Shu sucked in a mouthful of cold air before looking back to Chu Feng.

At that moment, his gaze became complicated.

Whilst martial cultivators possessed bloodlines, world spiritists actually also possessed bloodlines.

Of course, not everyone would have such a bloodline.

However, without a doubt, world spiritists that had bloodlines were all exceptionally talented.

Their talents were inherited. They were people destined to become world spiritists, people destined to be able to attain a certain amount of success.

Actually, not everyone could become world spiritists.

It was merely that as martial cultivators became stronger, they would be able to transform their spirit power.

Because of that, people that were originally unable to become world spiritists were able to become world spiritists.

Take for example the Nine Provinces Continent. World spiritists were extraordinary existences there.

The reason for their sacred status was because the great majority of the people there were incapable of becoming world spiritists.

However, in the Upper Realms, practically everyone was capable of using world spirit techniques. The only difference was in their level of world spirit techniques.

However, those people were actually not all natural world spiritists. The majority of them were people that had transformed their spirit power and forcibly become world spiritists.

The reason why Yuan Shu had been selected by Grandmaster Tang Chen as his disciple was because flowing through Yuan Shu’s body was a world spiritist bloodline that was lacking in most people.

Furthermore, the world spiritist bloodline within him was relatively pure.

That said, although he already knew that world spiritists possessed bloodlines, the bloodlines of world spiritists were much more ambiguous than those of martial cultivators.

Even for Yuan Shu, it was his first time seeing the true form of a world spiritist’s bloodline.

“So this is our world spiritist’s bloodline.”

“It’s actually beautiful like a soul.”

After learning that Chu Feng would not suffer any danger to his life, Yuan Shu was no longer as worried about him.

Rather, he began to stare at the so-called bloodline that was being released from his body.

He seemed to be admiring the bloodline power being released from Chu Feng’s body.

“That’s actually merely a form of the bloodline, and not the actual bloodline.”

“The actual bloodline is located in the depths of his soul. How could I possibly be able to extract that?” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Since that’s not actual bloodline power, why would brother Chu Feng be in such pain?” asked Yuan Shu.

“That’s the power of my spirit formation. The spirit formation is a test of one’s talent.”

“However, talent is something that needs to be aroused. The process will naturally be painful,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Master, exactly what must one do to breach your spirit formation?”

“Must brother Chu Feng arouse the talent hidden within him?” asked Yuan Shu.

“Breach my spirit formation?” Grandmaster Tang Chen smiled faintly after hearing those words.

“This spirit formation of mine was determined to be a spirit formation that cannot be breached the moment it was created,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Master, what do you mean by that?” asked Yuan Shu.

“What this old man means is that this spirit formation of mine is something that cannot be defeated,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Then... doesn’t it mean that your spirit formation is something that cannot be breached, and brother Chu Feng was doomed to fail from the very start?” asked Yuan Shu.

Grandmaster Tang Chen did not answer Yuan Shu. However, his silence gave him the answer.
