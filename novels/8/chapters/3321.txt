Chapter 3321 - The Threatened Grand Characters

"Two conditions?" Hearing those words, the crowd started to frown. They felt very displeased to be threatened by a person of the younger generation. Nevertheless, they still asked, "What sort of conditions, why don’t you tell us about them?"

"The first condition is, I want to strip that person’s rights to enjoy that treasure," Chu Feng pointed his finger at Li Taiyi. He added, "If someone who has seriously injured my clan’s clan chief can also enjoy the treasure, I am unable to find any justification to break that formation."

"This..."

At that moment, the crowd looked to one another. What Chu Feng said was very fair and reasonable. They were able to understand where he was coming from.

"Young friend Chu Feng, this old man will consent to that condition. That said, that treasure already no longer completely belongs to our Wuma Heavenly Clan. As such, I will have to consult with everyone too," the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

"Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng..." The crowd turned their gazes to Liangqiu Chengfeng.

No one was willing to offend the Li Heavenly Clan. As such, they all wished for Liangqiu Chengfeng to make a decision on this matter.

"To seriously injure an ally, that person should be deprived of his rights to enjoy the treasures," as Liangqiu Chengfeng spoke, he looked to Chu Feng, "Young friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. I will provide a proper account for you in this matter."

"Humph," Li Taiyi coldly snorted in a very displeased manner. Anger filled his face. However, he did not say anything else.

He was not even very afraid of Song Boqiu, much less anyone else present. However, faced with Liangqiu Chengfeng, he truly did not dare to say much.

Both in terms of personal strength or backing, Liangqiu Chengfeng was a person that Li Taiyi did not dare offend.

“Young friend Chu Feng, in that case, what is your second condition?” The crowd asked.

“The second condition is, I will need the seniors present to hand over the cultivation resources that you all obtained from the walls,” as Chu Feng spoke, he took a glance at the surrounding walls.

“What?” Hearing what Chu Feng said, the expressions of the grand individuals all turned unsightly.

The people of the younger generation had no idea what the cultivation resource that Chu Feng spoke of was. However, they knew very well that those would be rare cultivation resources. Thus, how could those people possibly be willing to hand them over to Chu Feng?

“Young friend Chu Feng, I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” someone said.

“Senior, you need not pretend to be confused. I even know the appearance of the cultivation resources that were previously on the walls,” Chu Feng said.

Indeed, Chu Feng knew about it. He had verified that those cultivation resources were truly present after reaching the palace hall. There could only be one possible explanation for them to not be seen. That is, they were taken away.

From the reaction of the crowd, Chu Feng was able to deduce that they should’ve divided those cultivation resources amongst themselves.

“Humph. Chu Feng, before we came in here, we’d already agreed that it will be up to our respective capabilities as to how many treasures we will be able to obtain here.”

“Indeed, there were some cultivation resources here. It’s also true that we have taken them and put them away. However, those cultivation resources were obtained by us through our respective abilities. Why should we give them to you?” An old man spoke coldly.

“That’s right. Chu Feng... we have given you sufficient face by depriving Li Taiyi of his qualification to enjoy the treasures here. You’d best not be too excessive and make this sort of outrageous demand.”

The crowd all began to crusade against Chu Feng.

Their reactions were understandable. After all, Chu Feng’s second demand concerned their own self-interest. Naturally, they would not want to comply with it.

“Earlier, that senior said that he had obtained the cultivation resources here with his own ability, and asked why he should hand the cultivation resources to me.”

“Regarding that, I would like to present such a question: if it wasn’t for me, Chu Feng, solving that main formation, how could you all possibly be able to open the spirit formation gate to this place?” Chu Feng asked.

“Humph, did you really think that it was all due to your contribution that you managed to solve the main formation? Are you to say that our clan’s younger generations did not provide their own contribution to that?”

“Chu Feng, you failed to inherit your father’s outstanding talent, and instead inherited his arrogance. This old man shall offer you a bit of advice. No one here will bother to argue with you here today. However, outside of this place, no one will tolerate this arrogance of yours. If you do not repent, you will, sooner or later, pay bitterly.”

The crowd were mocking, ridiculing and sneering at Chu Feng repeatedly.

“Hahaha...”

Faced with the crowd’s ridicules, Chu Feng was not only not angry, he instead started to laugh heartily.

Seeing the suddenly laughing Chu Feng, the grand individuals present were all startled. They were unable to understand why Chu Feng would suddenly react in such a manner.

At the moment when they were confused, Chu Feng opened his mouth and spoke again, “It is not that I, Chu Feng, am arrogant. I will also not deny the contributions my peers have made. However, you can ask them all who they relied on to solve the main formation and safely bring them to this place.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, the people of the younger generation all lowered their heads. After all, they knew very well that, had it not been for Chu Feng, they would not only not be able to reach that place, but they would not even be able to solve the main formation.

Right at that moment, Liangqiu Lanyue spoke, “Seniors, allow me to say a word in fairness. If it wasn’t for Chu Feng, we really would not have been able to reach this place. And now, we will have to rely on Chu Feng again for the spirit formation at hand. I feel that Chu Feng’s request is not excessive.”

“What my older sister said is extremely correct. Please excuse me for not respecting various seniors. However, I believe that seniors should all know very well as to exactly how much of a contribution you all have made to be able to stand here,” Liangqiu Hongyue added.

“Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng, regarding this...” At that moment, the crowd all turned their eyes to Liangqiu Chengfeng. They wanted Liangqiu Chengfeng to obtain justice for them.

“You all should handle something like this yourselves,” Liangqiu Chengfeng said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, why are you so avaricious?” Someone looked to Chu Feng.

“Avaricious?” Chu Feng smiled. Then, he said, “This is merely a demand of mine. If seniors feel that my demand is too excessive and not worth it, you can very well ignore my demand.”

“Merely, there is one thing that I will have to remind seniors of. This Ancient Era’s remnant is already open. If its treasure is not retrieved within three days’ time, it will disappear on its own,” Chu Feng said.

“What?” Hearing those words, the crowd’s expressions changed enormously. Then, they looked to Liangqiu Chengfeng and asked, “Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng, is that truly the case?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“That is indeed the case. Otherwise... this old man would not have asked young friend Chu Feng to destroy that spirit formation on my behalf,” Liangqiu Chengfeng said.

“This...” At that moment, the various grand characters all had very ugly expressions.

They were feeling extremely unwell. People of their status had never been threatened by a person of the younger generation before.

However, what caused them to feel the most powerless was that they were actually unable to do anything against that younger generation’s threat!!!
