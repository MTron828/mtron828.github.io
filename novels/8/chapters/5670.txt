Chapter 5670: Matters of the Immemorial Era

“Chu Feng, did you discover anything?” Fu Xing asked.

“I’m not sure. It’s hard to confirm anything,” Chu Feng said.

“Where’s your imprint? Did you conceal it?” Fu Xing asked.

“I did,” Chu Feng replied as he willed the imprint to appear.

He had a feeling he would be traveling out of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain earlier, so he hid the imprint to avoid others learning about his association with the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. That was the reason Xia Xingchen didn’t see his imprint even though he was nude at one point.

“It’s about time to leave,” Chu Feng remarked regretfully.

He had grasped a portion of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain’s powers, but his understanding of it was still limited. While he could hide the imprint, he still couldn’t control how long it lasted. He wanted to continue uncovering the secrets of this place, but the imprint could fade while he was spending time here.

If the imprint disappeared, he wouldn’t have evidence of his accomplishments in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain to present to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion anymore.

However, he knew that he could return to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain anytime he wished, as he had learned the rough locations of its teleportation formations spread across the galaxies. Thus, he didn’t have to rely on the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s entrance anymore.

In fact, he could rely on the Nine Heavens Secret Domain if he needed to travel a long distance.

The galaxy overlords and top-notch experts, even with treasures that augmented their traveling speed, could easily require tens of days of journey to travel from a galaxy to another galaxy, but through the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, Chu Feng would only require two hours.

In fact, the duration required could be shorter if he was traveling to a neighboring galaxy.

Chu Feng turned to Fu Xing and said, “The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion dispatched us here not just to evaluate us but to use us to scout the Nine Heavens Secret Domain too. There’s no doubt they’ll question us once we return. We could face danger if our answers don’t satisfy them.”

“How should we answer then?” Fu Xing asked.

“You can’t talk about me taking the Purpledemon Dagger. We’ll say that the Purpledemon Dagger was already gone when we returned to the altar a second time, possibly because it was consumed by the altar. Let’s say that I had to construct a new sealing formation to seal the altar. We’ll also alter the story about us defeating the black humanoid figure. We can’t talk about your weapon, after all.”

Chu Feng quickly came up with an alternative story that was unlikely to pique the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s suspicion.

“I have taken note of that. Is there anything else I need to take note of?” Fu Xing asked.

“Don’t tell them that I’ve gone through this gate. Let’s say that we did notice something special about this gate, but we don’t know how to activate it. As for the remaining, we can just speak the truth,” Chu Feng said.

“Got it,” Fu Xing replied.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was bound to know quite a bit about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, having explored this place many times before. There was no way they would believe them if they said that they didn’t see anything despite having cleared the trial.

Other than the deeper secrets they had uncovered, it was better for them to be honest about everything else.

After the two of them had finished their discussion, they began making their way out.

…

In the mysterious land shrouded by a seven-colored fog, the man who wore black armor but had the voice of a ten-year-old was still standing by a cliff.

“Milord, Chu Feng has returned from the Constellation Gate,” the black-armored man reported with the same childish voice.

“He’s returned? What did he say?” a booming voice echoed from the abyss.

“He told Fu Xing that he was teleported to somewhere else, and it wasn’t easy for him to return. He stated his conjecture that the Nine Heavens Secret Domain is a teleportation formation, just that someone has wrecked it. The remaining bits have nothing to do with the Nine Heavens Secret Domain; it’s a quick discussion about how they should report about their journey here to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

“Is he leaving now?”

“Yes. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion sent them here as part of a combat examination. They are evaluated based on how vivid the imprint is, and their imprint is already on the verge of fading,” the black-armored man replied.

“I see,” the colossal beast in the abyss said.

“Milord, there’s something I’m curious about. Chu Feng should be able to enter the Conqueror Domain if he’s able to activate the Constellation Gate, but why is he unable to confirm the true nature of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain? Was he unable to leave his name on the Conqueror Stele?” the black-haired man asked.

“Chu Feng should have been able to leave his name on the Conqueror Stele, but the thorough destruction of the Ninth Galaxy’s Main Constellation Gate has shaken the Main Constellation Gates of the other eight realms too, causing the Conqueror Stele to be damaged. Otherwise, Chu Feng would have been the first one in the present era to leave his name on the Conqueror Stele,” the colossal beast in the abyss said with a regretful tone.

“Hasn’t Lord Divine Eyes been working on repairing the Constellation Gate and the Conqueror Stele? How long will it take? Or is it impossible to fully repair it?” the black-haired man asked with a worried tone. He seemed to be concerned about the future of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.

“That lass? All that’s good about her is her Three Realms Divine Eyes. It’d be foolish to count on her. Chu Feng would have already entered the Conqueror Domain and left his name there if she could really fix it!” the colossal beast in the abyss said with a grudging tone.

“Oi oi oi, what are you doing? Why are you badmouthing my master behind her back?”

A person resembling a twelve-year-old girl suddenly appeared on the cliff not too far away. She was adorable with her golden dress and twintails, but she was glaring at the black-armored man with her arms akimbo.

The black-armored man was astonished to see the twin tails girl. He quickly clasped his fist and bowed, “Paying respects to Lord Divine Brush.”

“Shoo! You questioned my master earlier, only to call me Lord Divine Brush now!”

However, the girl refused to let things slide. She rolled up her sleeves and shook her fists as she stomped toward the black-armored man. The black-armored man, despite possessing an aura surpassing that of a True Dragon World Spiritist, was shockingly intimidated.

Weng!

All of a sudden, the girl released a flash of golden light, and her body transformed into a brush. It was the brush Chu Feng used to leave his name on the Conqueror Stele earlier. The brush flew into a fair hand.

It was the woman with divine eyes.

The woman put the brush behind her, but the brush continued to shake vigorously.

“Hmph! I’d have smacked that mouth of yours if not for my master stopping me, stinky Blacksoul!” The girl was still able to talk despite having turned into a brush.

I wasn’t the one who said those words, so why are you flaring up at me?

The black-armored man was indignant, but he dared not to voice those words in front of the woman with divine eyes. Instead, he kneeled down and said, “Paying respects to Lord Spirit God.”

Even the colossal beast in the abyss changed its tune upon seeing the woman. Its words still jolted the surrounding space, but its voice was jovial, “Lord Spirit God, what an honor to have you here!”

“Elder Monstrous Beast God, there’s no need to be so courteous. I have repaired the Conqueror Stele and all the Constellation Gates except for the ninth one,” the woman with divine eyes said.

“You have repaired the Conqueror Stele? Why didn’t Chu Feng leave his name on it then?” The colossal beast was confused.

“Elder, how can you be certain Chu Feng didn’t leave his name behind?” the woman with divine eyes asked.

“Are you saying that Chu Feng succeeded?” the colossal beast asked.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Yes,” the woman with divine eyes replied with a nod.

“Why does he sound so uncertain then? Ah, he’s keeping things from his companion. What a cunning one!” the colossal beast exclaimed. “It has been a long time since the Spirit God has paid me a visit. Did you come here to share this piece of news with me?”

“That disaster destroyed the foundations of the Nine Heaven Secret Domain. To protect this place, we had to alter the formation and dwell in our own realms. Elder Monstrous Beast God, you are unable to sense the happenings in the Conqueror Domain, and similarly, I am unable to sense the happenings outside of the Conqueror Domain. I came here to report to you that someone has left his name on the Conqueror Stele of the present era. Aside from that, I wish to gather information about the man named Chu Feng,” the woman with divine eyes said.

“Spirit God, you also know I’m in charge of suppressing those things. I’m getting old, and my body is not the same as before. It’s getting harder for me to suppress those things, so I left the administration of the trial to Blacksoul so that I can focus on the suppression. Why don’t I let Blacksoul share the details with you?” the colossal beast asked.

“Sure,” the woman with divine eyes said before turning to the black-armored man.

The black-armored man shared everything that had happened to the woman with divine eyes, and the latter fell into deep thought afterward.

“Spirit God, what’s your evaluation of the junior named Chu Feng?” the colossal beast asked.

“What’s your evaluation, Lord Monstrous Beast God?” the woman with divine eyes asked back.

“Above Qin Jiu.”

“That’s a high evaluation.”

“Yours?”

“He can surpass Qin Jiu.”

“That's a high evaluation from you too, Spirit God. If so, why don’t you meet him before he leaves?” the colossal beast suggested.

“There’s no rush. I’ll continue observing him first,” the woman with divine eyes said.

“It’s hard to enter the Conqueror Domain due to the destruction inflicted on the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. If not for Chu Feng being so talented as to induce a resonation with the Nine Galaxies’ Main Constellation Gates, he would have never been able to step into the Conqueror Domain even if you have repaired the other eight Main Constellation Gates, let alone leave his name on the Conqueror Stele,” the colossal beast said.

“I understand how you feel, Elder Monstrous Beast God. I also agree that Chu Feng is a talent. However, you shouldn’t forget that the disaster only happened because we were too impatient to tell those two from the Ancient Era about the Immemorial Era,” the woman with divine eyes said.

The colossal beast fell silent. Moments later, it said with a sigh, “Let’s observe him more.”
