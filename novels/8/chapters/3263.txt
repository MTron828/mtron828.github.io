Chapter 3263 - The Battle Between Kings

At that moment, the people of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, that group of people that ruled over the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, silently lowered their heads when faced with Chu Feng’s question.

They actually did not dare to answer him. In fact, they did not even dare to look Chu Feng in the face.

They naturally did not wish to leave the Overlord Region and renounce their position as the ruler of the Overlord Region just like that.

However, they were incapable of contending against Chu Feng, and did not dare to oppose him.

Because of that, they were placed between a rock and a hard place, and had no idea what to do.

“Chu Feng, what sort of capability is it to rely on the power of a spirit formation?! If you have the guts, why don’t you use your own strength to defeat me?!”

A shout filled with unreconciliation sounded from the the surface. It was Linghu Tiemian.

Although he was unable to move as he lay on the ground, he still shouted furiously.

That said, the crowd felt a sense of helplessness toward his furious shout.

Chu Feng had already obtained power akin to a god. How could he lower himself to compete with his own strength?

Only a fool would accept Linghu Tiemian’s rude request. However, it was clear that Chu Feng was not a fool.

“Very well, if you wish me to compete using my own strength, I will use my own strength to fight with you.”

However, after Linghu Tiemian’s words left his mouth, Chu Feng actually nodded and agreed to Linghu Tiemian’s seemingly absurd demand.

Not to mention the others, even Linghu Tiemian himself was surprised. He reacted as if he did not dare to believe what he had just heard.

However, at the very next moment, Linghu Tiemian and the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen beside him all felt the control of their bodies returning to them.

Linghu Tiemian and the other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were suppressed to the ground all got back onto their feet. They were practically certain that Chu Feng had retrieved that overwhelming spirit formation’s power.

Could it be that Chu Feng was really planning to not use the overwhelming power of that spirit formation, and instead use his own strength to battle Linghu Tiemian?

The crowd were even more puzzled upon seeing this scene. This was especially true for the people from the Dongguo Heavenly Clan. They all turned their gazes to Dongguo Bingyu.

They seemed to be asking with their eyes ‘Why is Chu Feng this stupid? He could’ve clearly expelled the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen with the power of that spirit formation. Why must he create trouble for himself?’

“Everyone, calm yourselves. Chu Feng is not an impulsive person. Perhaps he has another plan in mind. Let us continue to spectate,” Dongguo Bingyu said to her clansmen through a voice transmission.

Even though she told her clansmen to calm themselves, and also knew that Chu Feng should have some sort of trick to handle the matter, those were merely her guesses. Even she was incapable of verifying whether or not her guess was correct.

Before the answer revealed itself, she was also filled with unease.

After all, Chu Feng had already seized victory. Yet, this decision from him had added suspense to the confrontation again.

Everyone was wondering exactly what Chu Feng was thinking. Did he really possess the strength to contend against Linghu Tiemian, or was he overly confident in himself?

“Chu Feng, are you truly willing to abandon the power of that spirit formation and fight me using your own strength?”

After standing back up, Linghu Tiemian said to Chu Feng, “Should you truly be willing to do so, I will recognize you, Chu Feng, as a man should I be defeated by you.”

He actually said those words to Chu Feng because he was afraid that Chu Feng would go back on his word. After all, Chu Feng had already grasped absolute power. Even if he decided to go back on his word, there was nothing that he, Linghu Tiemian, could do about it.

“I don’t need acknowledgement from you, Linghu Tiemian. However, I do have a demand,” Chu Feng said.

“What is it? Speak away,” Linghu Tiemian said.

“If I, Chu Feng, am to win, then you shall bring everyone from your Linghu Heavenly Clan and scram from this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Remember, you shall be getting the hell out of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,” Chu Feng spoke with an indifferent tone. Confidence filled his eyes.

It was as if Chu Feng were already certain of his victory.

“And what if you are to lose?” Linghu Tiemian asked.

“Should I, Chu Feng, lose, then the ones leaving this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm will be our Chu Heavenly Clansmen.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he looked to his clansmen behind him. He asked, “If I am to lose, are you all willing to leave with me?”

“We’re willing!”

“Little brother Chu Feng, the decision is in your hands!”

Chu Feng’s words received the full support of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

Even though they did not understand why Chu Feng didn’t directly drive the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen out, and instead decided to take a chance like this, they still supported Chu Feng unconditionally. After all, they knew very well how petty and low, how small and weak, they were in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm before he had arrived.

The reason why they were able to stand in this plaza in opposition to the Linghu Heavenly Clan before the powers from the various regions was all thanks to Chu Feng.

The bystanders were quite surprised to see the Chu Heavenly Clansmen supporting Chu Feng in such a manner.

After all, according to rumors, the Chu Heavenly Clan was a clan that was incapable of cooperation. Not only did they forget about morality before profit, but they were also extremely cowardly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, judging from things now, the current Chu Heavenly Clan was completely different from the past.

Those bystanders firmly believed that it must all be because of Chu Feng.

Because of that, when they looked to Chu Feng again, there was more reverence in their eyes.

Ignoring his strength, merely Chu Feng’s power to rally the crowd, merely his impact, was sufficient to show that he was extraordinary.

“Very well, I’ll agree to it,” Linghu Tiemian agreed to Chu Feng’s condition without any hesitation.

However, immediately afterward, he added, “However, I also have a condition of my own. You cannot use that spirit formation’s power. You can only use your own power to defeat me.”

“Of course.”

“If I, Chu Feng, am to use the power of that spirit formation to defeat you, then I, Chu Feng, shall suffer a miserable death. I will have disgraced my father, Chu Xuanyuan,” Chu Feng vowed.

“Very well. In that case, allow me to experience the true strength of Chu Xuanyuan’s son!” Linghu Tiemian shouted.

Immediately after, everyone on the plaza distanced themselves from the center of the plaza. They all retreated to the distinguished guests’ viewing platform.

The feast that was on the plaza was also tidied up.

At that moment, only two people stood over the plaza.

They were...

... the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Linghu Tiemian.

... and

... the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Feng.

A battle that concerned the position of the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was about to begin at any moment!!!
