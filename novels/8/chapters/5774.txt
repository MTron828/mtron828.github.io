Chapter 5774: Little Fishy is Too Powerful

Xian Miaomiao was inside a huge ancient palace, together with Long Chengyu, Qin Xuan, and Huangfu Fanni. All of them were currently crossing blows.

Xian Miaomiao was injured, whereas Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan had joined hands to deal with Huangfu Fanni. It was a surprising partnership that Chu Feng never expected to see.

Both of them had raised from rank six Half-God level to rank nine Half-God level, and they had drawn their God Armaments as well.

On the other hand, Huangfu Fanni had activated his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, raising his cultivation to rank nine Half-God level as well. He hadn’t drawn his God Armament yet, but he was still able to fend off Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu.

It was not that Huangfu Fanni didn’t have a God Armament, as he likely had one inside the black wooden box he carried on his back. Rather, it was likelier that he didn’t think he needed to rely on his God Armament to deal with Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu.

“Is Huangfu Fanni that powerful? No, it’s Little Fishy who’s truly powerful.”

Chu Feng remembered how Huangfu Fanni had challenged Little Fishy, only to be floored by a single punch from her. That led him to think that Huangfu Fanni was weak, but that was clearly not the case.

Chu Feng could have used the mirror to teleport to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s endpoint, but that would have meant leaving Xian Miaomiao and Long Chengyu to the lurch. There was no way he could do that.

Boom!

In the ancient palace, there was yet another intense clash. Long Chengyu was knocked back, and Qin Xuan was barely standing his ground.

“Long Chengyu, take Miss Miaomiao away from here,” Qin Xuan said.

“What nonsense are you spouting? We promised to work together! There’s no way I can abandon you,” Long Chengyu replied as he charged into the fight once more.

“Stop being obstinate and take Miss Miaomiao away!” Qin Xuan roared.

Uwah!

A burst of lightning power exploded. The ancient palace was vast enough to house many mountain ranges, but the sheer force of the lightning power still sent both Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu slamming right into its walls.

“I see. You’re hoping to play the hero here. Women indeed spell disaster. Let me eradicate this disaster on your behalf!” Huangfu Fanni said as he bolted toward Xian Miaomiao.

Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan immediately charged forward with their movement skills to stop Huangfu Fanni, but it was clear that they wouldn’t make it on time as they were too far away.

Boom!

Just as Huangfu Fanni was about to land his lightning-clad fist on Xian Miaomiao, there was suddenly a flash of blinding light. A person appeared in front of Xian Miaomiao—Chu Feng!

Chu Feng caught Huangfu Fanni’s fist with his palm.

“Chu Feng?”

Qin Xuan, Xian Miaomiao, and Long Chengyu were taken aback, but Huangfu Fanni was horrified.

“Were you the one who injured her?” Chu Feng asked.

“I…”

Huangfu Fanni was just about to reply when Chu Feng smashed his fist into Huangfu Fanni’s abdomen without any warning, causing the latter to spurt huge mouthfuls of blood. This heavy blow should have sent Huangfu Fanni flying, but Chu Feng held him firmly in place by grabbing his arm.

As a result, a huge hole was blown through Huangfu Fanni’s abdomen, causing him to fall powerlessly to his knees.

“This…” Qin Xuan was dumbfounded.

The strength Chu Feng had just exerted wasn’t martial power but spirit power. It was the spirit power of an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.

It was common sense that Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists possessed fighting prowess comparable to rank seven Half-God level cultivators, but the might of Chu Feng’s punch actually surpassed ordinary rank nine Half-God level cultivators.

Otherwise, there was no way he could knock out Huangfu Fanni with a single punch.

But it was well known that it was extremely hard to achieve heaven-defying battle power for spirit power. Even Jie Tian and Ling Xiao were only able to raise their fighting prowess by a single cultivation rank.

Yet, Chu Feng was able to raise his fighting prowess by two ranks? This was unbelievable!

But again, given that Chu Feng had a True God level world spirit and the overwhelming might of his bloodline, this ridiculous feat didn’t seem that inconceivable for him.

“Chu Feng, don’t you think it’s unbecoming of a cultivator to resort to spirit power?” the kneeling Huangfu Fanni said while spurting blood.

“Spirit power is a part of my power too,” Chu Feng replied.

He released Huangfu Fanni’s hand before releasing a kick that sent the latter flying a hundred thousand meters upward, smashing right into the formation-reinforced palace ceiling and getting lodged into it.

“I’ll give you a chance. I won’t use my spirit power. I’ll spare your life if you can defeat me,” Chu Feng said.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He retracted his spirit power and activated his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, raising his cultivation to rank eight Half-God level.

“His base cultivation is rank five Half-God level? I thought he was at rank three Half-God level?”

The others were taken aback, as Huangfu Jiangyao had previously tested Chu Feng’s cultivation to be at rank three Half-God level.

At the same time, they were also perplexed, as Huangfu Fanni had already raised his cultivation to rank nine Half-God level. How could Chu Feng be a match for him?

“Chu Feng, don’t let your emotions get the better of you! What’s the point of proving yourself to such a person? Just end him with your spirit power!” Qin Xuan shouted.

Chu Feng kept his eyes on Huangfu Fanni, not paying any heed to Qin Xuan. “Aren’t you going to make your move?”

“Y-you really aren’t going to use your spirit power?”

Huangfu Fanni dared not to make his move because he didn’t trust Chu Feng. How could a rank eight Half-God level cultivator possibly be a match for him? Chu Feng had to be lying to him.

“You don’t have a choice but to trust my words, unless you’re tired of living,” Chu Feng said.

Those words reminded Huangfu Fanni of his plight.

Chu Feng was not only a powerful world spiritist, but he had a True God level world spirit too. There was no way Huangfu Fanni could escape from an opponent so powerful. His only choice was to take up Chu Feng’s offer and pray that the latter would uphold his promise.

“Chu Feng, I trust you’re a man of your word.”

Huangfu Fanni’s eyes glowed tenaciously. In the blink of an eye, he flitted up to Chu Feng and smashed his lightning-clad fist at Chu Feng’s head. He was planning to take Chu Feng’s life!

If this strike landed, Chu Feng would surely lose his life.

However, Chu Feng tilted his body and dodged the punch before releasing a punch of his own. His strike landed squarely on Huangfu Fanni’s abdomen, causing the latter to kneel before him once more.

“You…” Huangfu Fanni spurted fresh blood while staring at Chu Feng in bewilderment.

He could tell that Chu Feng had only used his martial power in this punch, but how was it that a rank eight Half-God level cultivator was flooring him, a rank nine Half-God level cultivator, with a single strike?

Qin Xuan, Long Chengyu, and Xian Miaomiao were equally confused too.
