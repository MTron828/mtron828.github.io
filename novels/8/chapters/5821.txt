Chapter 5821: Guiding Direction

“You have two hours. You have to tame your Dao Creation Palace within the time limit, or else you’ll be deemed to have failed, and you’ll be evicted from this land,” the deep voice echoed.

A terrifying aura surfaced, and their surroundings shook intensely once more.

This was completely different from when Little Fishy, Wang Qiang, and Xianhai Shaoyu proceeded to the taming phase of their Dao Creation Buildings. It felt as if the end of the world had arrived!

“The h-h-heck! I’d expect no less from a Dao Creation Palace. T-t-this is insane! Can Brother Chu Feng tame that in t-t-two hours?” Wang Qiang was worried.

Chu Feng waved his sleeves, and the Dao Creation Palace immediately retracted its aura and swiftly contracted till it was around the size of a bead, at which it fused into his body.

“What? Is it over? Y-y-you have already tamed it?” Wang Qiang walked over to Chu Feng’s side and stared at him with eyes of disbelief.

“Mmhm.” Chu Feng nodded.

“Heavens.” Wang Qiang was taken aback.

The others were flabbergasted too.

“How much did your c-c-cultivation rise by?” Wang Qiang asked once more.

“Cultivation? Does taming the Dao Creation Palace raise your cultivation?” Chu Feng asked.

“L-l-look.” Wang Qiang revealed his cultivation. He glanced at Little Fishy and Xianhai Shaoyu. “It isn’t just me.”

“Big brother, we have made breakthroughs in our cultivation,” Little Fishy said.

“Oh? Give me a moment.” Chu Feng projected his consciousness into his dantian.

On top of the nine-colored lightning and the Sacred Tree Seed, there was now a majestic black palace too.

It was Chu Feng’s Dao Creation Palace, but it had expanded over ten thousand times larger inside his dantian. The black aura tinged with nine-colored lightning shrouding it enveloped a larger area too. It was incredibly grandiose, looking like another realm inside his dantian.

Chu Feng tried to communicate with the Dao Creation Palace, and the black aura shrouding it began billowing till it formed the shape of the Nine Galaxies. A ray of light beamed from the Dao Creation Palace toward one of the galaxies.

It was the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

Chu Feng closely examined the Dao Creation Palace, but he quickly noticed it felt incomplete despite its domineering appearance. It could only provide him guidance at the moment.

Thus, he retracted his consciousness to his main body and asked the others, “How are your Dao Creation Palaces?”

Wang Qiang stretched his hand forth, and his Dao Creation Building manifested on his palm. “Look, Brother C-C-Chu Feng. Not all of the buildings constructed here are called Dao Creation P-P-Palaces. Ours are called Dao Creation B-B-Buildings.”

Little Fishy and Xianhai Shaoyu took out their Dao Creation Buildings too.

Chu Feng looked at the other two Dao Creation Buildings before turning his attention back to Wang Qiang’s one. “You have an interesting choice of name.”

“D-d-don’t mention it. The Immemorial Land of Dao Creation is bullying me over my stutter,” Wang Qiang cursed.

Chu Feng burst into laughter.

He hadn’t seen what happened to Wang Qiang as he was too focused on his construction, but he could imagine what happened earlier.

“I-i-it’s all Xianhai Shaoyu’s fault! If not for him naming his b-b-building over his name, I wouldn’t have done the same.” Wang Qiang dumped his resentment on Xianhai Shaoyu.

Xianhai Shaoyu laughed. “I’ll take the blame, but I do think that your Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Mansion has a nicer ring around it than Qiang Mansion. What do you think, little sister?”

“Not bad. I think it suits Wang Qiang,” Little Fishy teased.

“Y-y-you have been led astray!” Wang Qiang felt even more indignant.

Chu Feng raised his palm and manifested his Dao Creation Palace.

“Waa, the Dao Creation Palace is indeed different!” Wang Qiang exclaimed.

In terms of appearance and disposition, Chu Feng’s Dao Creation Palace was superior to their Dao Creation Buildings.

“Big brother, were you unable to make a breakthrough?” Little Fishy asked.

“Yes, I didn’t make a breakthrough. That’s why I’m curious to know what you have gained from your Dao Creation Buildings,” Chu Feng said.

He quickly learned that Little Fishy and the others enjoyed a breakthrough in their cultivation right after they tamed their Dao Creation Buildings. Their Dao Creation Buildings also provided them with guidance, but the guidance was incomplete, so they had to further ponder about it.

This suggested that Chu Feng’s Dao Creation Palace and their Dao Creation Buildings were likely to be incomplete. The only difference was that their Dao Creation Buildings had raised their cultivation, whereas Chu Feng’s Dao Creation Palace hadn’t.

“D-d-don’t think too much into it, brother. Your Dao Creation Palace is c-c-clearly superior to ours. You’ll benefit more from it in t-t-the future,” Wang Qiang said.

“At least it’s not a wasted trip,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He could sense that the Dao Creation Palace would be an invaluable help to him in the future.

He turned to Feng Ling and the others and saw them struggling. They were having difficulties taming their Dao Creation Buildings. He wanted to help them, but there was nothing he could do as this was an individual trial.

The outcome was just as he had expected.

Even though Feng Ling, Ling Xiao, Jie Baobao, Xian Miaomiao, and Yuwen Yanri had constructed their Dao Creation Buildings, they were unable to tame it. They could only watch helplessly as their Dao Creation Buildings floated away from them.

Indignation could be seen in their eyes.

Even the usually noisy Feng Ling had fallen silent.

“The road of cultivation is tough, and there’s more than one path leading to the goal. Some have succeeded in their dao creation in the early years of the present era, but those who failed didn’t lag. Some even overtook those who succeeded in their dao creation,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“You need not console me, Xianhai Shaoyu. I might have failed in my dao creation, but I don’t think I’m any weaker than you,” Feng Ling said with a brilliant smile.

Even the reticent Yuwen Yanri spoke up as well, “You don’t need to worry about us. We won’t be beaten down by failure. We’ll only rise stronger.”

Ling Xiao, Jie Baobao, and Xian Miaomiao quickly recovered too.

It was normal for them to be upset. Who wouldn’t be upset to fail here after coming this far? However, they were prodigies who had been through hardships. They were respected not just for their talents but their mental resilience too. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
