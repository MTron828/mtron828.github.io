Chapter 5405: A Fortuitous Encounter From My Grandson

Lord Nianqing slowly staggered her way out of the Divine Inheritance Ground with Shuang Xue, who had just returned from Hell’s Cage. It was perplexing how the two of them were walking side by side, but Lord Nianqing’s footsteps got increasingly arduous while Shuang Xue was perfectly fine.

Large droplets of sweat pattered down Lord Nianqing’s face as her legs trembled non-stop.

“Milord, why don’t we call it quits?” Shuang Xue worriedly asked.

“I have to get out of here,” Lord Nianqing insisted.

She continued dragging her feet forward, but her legs suddenly caved in and she fell frontward.

Shuang Xue immediately rushed forward to support her master. She looked at the frail elderly woman in her arms with reddened eyes and murmured, “How did things turn out like that?”

Right after Shuang Xue had returned from Hell’s Cage, Lord Nianqing entrusted this place to her and declared that she would look for Chu Feng. The elderly woman was too worried about Chu Feng, and she couldn’t wait to reunite with her grandson too.

Shuang Xue understood how Lord Nianqing felt, and she also knew what kind of troubles would befall Chu Feng if the others from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion learned about his identity. Thus, she didn’t dissuade Lord Nianqing and even chose to send her off.

It was then that something bizarre happened. A repulsion force suddenly began acting against Lord Nianqing as if to stop her from leaving the Divine Inheritance Ground. The closer she came to the borders of the Divine Inheritance Ground, the stronger the repulsion force.

In contrast, Shuang Xue wasn’t affected at all.

“Shuang Xue, carry me out,” Lord Nianqing said feebly.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Milord…” Shuang Xue was hesitant. She was worried that she would inflict irreversible damage on Lord Nianqing if she were to go against the repulsion force and carry her master out.

“What are you hesitating for? How can I face Ranqing if something happens to Chu Feng?” Lord Nianqing roared.

Shuang Xue reluctantly lifted Lord Nianqing up and continued making her way out of the Divine Inheritance Ground. She was still able to walk normally, but she dared not to walk too fast. Every step that she made was with utmost prudence, especially since she could clearly sense Lord Nianqing growing progressively weaker.

“What are you hesitating for? Hurry up and bring me out, lest this formation bind you as well,” Lord Nianqing bellowed, but she was so weak that her voice hardly sounded intimidating at all.

“Milord…”

Tears burst out from Shuang Xue’s eyes. She was worried that Lord Nianqing would really die at this rate.

Lord Nianqing feebly grabbed Shuang Xue’s sleeves with her trembling hands and looked at the latter with reddened eyes. “Shuang Xue, the greatest regret of my life is failing to immediately send Ranqing away. I failed to protect her. I never should have hesitated. But heaven has given me a second chance. I can’t allow any harm to befall Ranqing’s child. Carry me out of here. Let me protect Ranqing’s child! Let me protect my grandson!!!”

“Milord, I…”

Shuang Xue could sense the intensity of Lord Nianqing’s feelings, and that put her in a spot. She couldn’t allow anything to happen to Lord Nianqing, but she didn’t want this matter to become another knot in her master’s heart.

Lord Nianqing would never forgive herself if a mishap were to happen to Chu Feng. She would live in misery for the rest of her life.

“Shuang Xue, carry me out. I’ll willingly pay any price that this darned place demands from my old body. I’m begging you, carry me out…” Lord Nianqing actually began begging her.

“Milord, don’t say that. I’ll carry you out.”

Shuang Xue broke out into tears. Feeling Lord Nianqing’s resolve, she hardened her heart to bring her master out of this place regardless of the price.

“Fool. Are you trying to kill her?”

A feminine figure formed out of frost suddenly appeared out of thin air and blocked their path. Astonishingly, the feeble Lord Nianqing actually started to recover shortly after her appearance. The repulsion force that had been crushing down on Lord Nianqing had abruptly vanished.

However, Lord Nianqing didn’t rush off right away. Instead, she got to her feet and bowed to the frost woman before asking, “Milord, why are you forbidding me from leaving this land?”

She could tell that the frost woman was likely to be the master of this Divine Inheritance Ground. As long as the other party willed so, she would never be able to leave this place.

“What’s the use of you leaving this place? Are you able to protect Chu Feng?” the frost woman asked.

“Milord, you know about Chu Feng?” Lord Nianqing was astonished.

“How can I be oblivious as to what’s happening here?” The frost woman was implying that she was aware of everything that was happening in the Divine Inheritance Ground.

“Milord, I know that my strength is limited, but I’m willing to put my life on the line to protect him,” Lord Nianqing said.

The frost woman snorted and said, “Do you know why the cultivation ground suddenly opened?”

“Why?” Lord Nianqing was also bewildered by that matter too.

“It’s because Chu Feng has obtained the final legacy of the Divine Inheritance Ground. It is on his account that my master has decided to give you a chance and open the cultivation ground,” the frost woman said.

“It’s because of Chu Feng?”

Both Lord Nianqing and Shuang Xue were taken aback. They had thought about many possibilities regarding this matter, but they had never thought that it would be due to Chu Feng.

Lord Nianqing lowered her head. She had never provided any help to Chu Feng over the years, but the latter had brought her such a huge benefit shortly after their meeting. That made her feel even more indebted to her grandson.

“The cultivation ground has been modified to your bloodline power. You should be able to sense how beneficial it is to you. I won’t stop you if you insist on leaving, but I’ll close the cultivation ground and you’ll never be able to step in there. Will you cherish the opportunity your grandson created for you, or will you squander this fortuitous encounter and attempt to protect him with your current meager strength? You choose,” the frost woman said.

Lord Nianqing hesitated upon hearing those words, but she quickly made up her mind and replied, “Milord, I’m grateful for your advice. I’ll grasp this opportunity and not let my grandson’s efforts be in vain.”

“That’s more like it. I’ll also offer you some words of advice. Your grandson is no ordinary man. He doesn’t need your protection. Rather, you’re the one who… Haa. Just do everything you can to grow stronger, lest you become a burden to him in the future.”

The frost woman waved her hand before dissipating into thin air.

Shuang Xue was utterly shocked by what she had heard. For even Lord Nianqing to become a burden… she couldn’t begin to imagine what kind of potential Chu Feng harnessed within him?
