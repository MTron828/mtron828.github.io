Chapter 5942: Scheming Smile

“Chu Feng?” a familiar voice echoed.

“Immortal Slaughter’s Number Two?”

Chu Feng recognized this voice and gaze. The other party had looked at him with the same eyes through a teleportation formation when he killed his disciple.

“You refused to appear when I killed your disciple, and now you aren’t going to appear either when I killed your brothers. It looks like that’s as far as your brotherhood ends, though I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. What kinship can you expect from beasts?” Chu Feng sneered.

“Release the two of them, Chu Feng. There’s no need for us to go this far. We brothers have already joined the Netherworld Sect, which means that we’re on the same side now,” Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Two said.

“We will never be on the same side. I’ll send these two beasts to hell. You’re next.”

Chu Feng waved his hand, and the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Three and Number Four. Their protection formations didn’t stand a chance against his Protection Bane. He quickly ended their lives because he knew he couldn’t deal with Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Two yet.

Number Two might come with reinforcements if I continue stalling. I have to kill these two first.

He didn’t waste their origin energies either. Eggy absorbed and assimilated them on the spot.

Chu Feng turned to Eggy and observed her up close. She was so beautiful that he could never get enough of looking at her. However, he was trembling right now not because of her beauty but how important she was.

“What are you looking at? Are you thinking of taking advantage of me again? You aren’t a match for me now. I’ll whack you if you dare try anything.” Eggy retreated with a frown.

Chu Feng burst into laughter. “Are you truly fine now?”

“Not exactly. Those things are rather tenacious. I’ll still have to go into closed-door training and condition myself. However, you don’t have to worry about me. Aren’t I standing fine before you now?” Eggy said as she turned around.

“How can I not be worried given your previous state?”

“All right, all right. I didn’t mean for that to happen either. I’ll be fine from now on.”

“How long will you be in closed-door training?”

“I’m not sure. You just have to know that I’ll be fine. Stop stuffing me with sorts of random stuff. I’m about to die from overnutrition!!!” Eggy exclaimed with a pout.

“Got it, Milady Queen. It’s all good as long as you’re fine,” Chu Feng replied.

“I’ll be going into closed-door training now, all right?” Eggy asked with reluctant eyes despite her distant words.

“Go on, but come back fast. I’m waiting for you to back me up.”

“No problem. I’ll be back in a jiffy.”

Eggy returned to the World Spirit Space and sat down. To Chu Feng’s relief, her condition remained stable as she went into closed-door training, and that finally put his heart at ease.

Now that Eggy was fine, the most pressing issue he had on hand was Little Fishy.

He made his way to his agreed meeting location with Song Yun.

The following day, Song Yun appeared.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I got the news. Xianhai Yu’er was indeed kidnapped by our Netherworld Sect, and she’s currently in Bluesnow Upper Realm.”

Those words put Chu Feng’s heart at ease. At least, he knew where Little Fishy was now.

“Do you know where she’s imprisoned? Why did your Netherworld Sect capture Xianhai Yu’er? How is she doing?” Chu Feng dropped a series of questions.

“Did you obtain the bottle I requested?” Song Yun asked.

“It’s here.” Chu Feng took out the bottle and passed it to Song Yun.

Song Yun smiled. She stowed away the bottle before asking, “Did you see a white-haired ugly man in the hall where you found the bottle?”

“There is a white-haired man, but I don’t think he’s ugly.” Chu Feng remembered that person to be quite dashing.

“Well, I think he’s ugly. That ugly man is the son of one of the new faction’s powerhouses. Xianhai Yu’er was to become fodder for his cultivation. I only know that much.

“She’s currently imprisoned somewhere else in preparation for the refinement process, but that place is tightly guarded. Many of the new faction’s experts are stationed there. It won’t be easy for you to rescue her, big brother Chu Feng. I’d even say that it’s an impossible task. You should garner the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s help instead. If you’re fast, you might just make it in time.”

Song Yun passed another map to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng glanced at the map before asking, “Yun’er, are you sure the map is accurate?”

“Rest assured. Xianhai Yu’er is there,” Song Yun replied.

“Thank you, Yun’er.” Chu Feng stowed away the map.

“Big brother Chu Feng, if you bring in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan to rescue Xianhai Yu’er, you should let them do the job. You shouldn’t reveal yourself,” Song Yun advised.

“Why?” Chu Feng asked.

“A Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is already a headache for you. I don’t think you should get on hostile terms with the Netherworld Sect at this juncture.”

“I’ll take note of it. Little sister Yun’er, how should I contact you in the future?”

“I’m currently wandering with the sect. I don’t even know where I’m heading next. That being said, big brother Chu Feng, we’ll meet again at the peak of the world of cultivation,” Song Yun replied.

“Definitely.” Chu Feng nodded. He believed that both he and Song Yun had the ability to pull that off.

“Little sister Yun’er, I’ll be leaving first,” Chu Feng said before rising into the air. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Wait,” Song Yun suddenly called out.

Chu Feng turned around to look at her. To his surprise, the latter leaped into his arms and kissed him on the cheek before he could react.

Then, she quickly retreated from his arms and even distanced herself three meters away.

“Stay safe, big brother Chu Feng,” Song Yun said with a beaming smile as if nothing had happened earlier.

“You stay safe too.”

Chu Feng didn’t criticize her for her actions. He rose into the sky and left in the direction indicated on Song Yun’s map.

“Elder, I’ll need to borrow your strength,” Chu Feng told the Divine Deer.

Fearing that Little Fishy might meet with a mishap, he didn’t intend to seek the help of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan right away. Besides, the Netherworld Sect was prepared for an attack. There was no guarantee that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan would be able to rescue Little Fishy.

So, Chu Feng intended to use the Divine Deer’s powers.

What he didn’t know was that after he left, Song Yun looked in the direction where he left with a scheming smile.
