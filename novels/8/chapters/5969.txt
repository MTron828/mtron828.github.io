Chapter 5970: Obtaining the Treasure

Don’t worry, elder. I’ll safely bring all of you out of here, including the four elders if they are here too. However, I’d like to first state that I will be taking the treasure here,” Chu Feng said.

“Of course. The treasure naturally belongs to anyone who can obtain it. We brothers don’t have the means to reach it, or else we wouldn’t have been trapped here. I’d rather have young friend Chu Feng take the treasure than others,” Daoist Fifth Dragon said.

Chu Feng smiled. “Don’t worry, elder. I’ll take you out of here soon enough.”

Those words were spoken with confidence, but Daoist Fifth Dragon remained skeptical. Despite having heard about Chu Feng’s affairs from Daoist Sixth Dragon and the others, this was still a terrifying place that even his four older brothers were unable to conquer.

Chu Feng might be capable, but it was unlikely that he could bring them out any time soon.

He was not looking down on Chu Feng; he simply thought that leaving this place was no easy feat.

Just then, Chu Feng flicked his wrist and took out an item.

“This is?” Daoist Fifth Dragon narrowed his eyes.

He recognized that item. It was the death immunity token—a golden one, at that!

If he still harbored any suspicions about Chu Feng’s talents, this golden immunity token cleared his doubts. The person before him was not just any ordinary prodigy; he might just be the most talented world spiritist in the current world of cultivation.

At the very least, he had already surpassed Ling Xiao, or else he couldn’t have obtained this death immunity token, let alone a golden one.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you...”

To the Daoist Fifth Dragon’s astonishment, Chu Feng was channeling the spirit power inside the death immunity token, and from the looks of it, he was trying to break it down.

But why would Chu Feng break down the death immunity token? It was an invaluable survival means in this remnant!

Chu Feng noticed Daoist Fifth Dragon’s confusion, so he lifted the token and said, “Elder, there are three conditions to obtaining the treasure here.

“The first condition is to figure out the correct deciphering sequence and be courageous enough to open that door.

“The second condition is to own the death immunity token. It doesn’t matter whether it’s golden, silver, or bronze.

“I have only just figured out the third condition myself, and that is to forsake all self-preservation means, especially the death immunity token. This is a test of courage, where we are to put our lives on the line. As much as this exposes me to danger, it also opens up the path to success.”

Kacha!

The golden immunity token shattered.

The earth shook, and ocean water receded into the ground. At the same time, all restrictions were lifted.

A massive and extravagant stone door rose from the ground. Spirit power spiraled from it, sucking Chu Feng in.

Yet, Daoist Fifth Dragon, despite being next to Chu Feng, was not affected by the spirit power. That spirit power was specifically targeted at Chu Feng.

Daoist Fifth Dragon felt goosebumps all over his arm, as he was convinced that he had just seen history in the making. A remnant that had remained uncleared for countless years was finally going to be cleared by a junior—Chu Feng!

“My younger brothers were too conservative with their descriptions. Given young friend Chu Feng’s talents, he might reach a height no one else has ever seen. It’s no wonder Lord Taowu acknowledged him. God’s Era is real, though it waits to be seen who the final victor is!” Daoist Fifth Dragon remarked.

He closed his eyes and unleashed his powerful psyche. Now that the restrictions had been lifted, he could use his senses to locate his brothers.

Soon, he opened his eyes and vanished from the spot.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng entered a majestic but empty palace.

Only two objects were floating at the center of the palace. One was an ancient scroll emanating the aura of the Ancient Era. The other was a key fragment.

The key fragment and the ancient scroll drifted into Chu Feng’s arms as soon as he stepped into the palace as if recognizing him to be their master.

He first stowed away the key fragment before examining the scroll.

The scroll was extremely long, containing many powerful formations. At the top of the scroll were two huge words—Heaven Tome.

“Heaven Tome? I’d have never thought that the treasure here is the Heaven Tome.” Chu Feng burst into laughter.

The Heaven Tome would be of great help to him.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion already had the Heaven Tome. If they had known that the treasure was the Heaven Tome, they probably wouldn’t have spent so much effort deciphering it anymore.

Of course, the key fragment was important too, or else Jie Tianran wouldn’t have ordered yet another expedition to clear the remnant.

Chu Feng began studying the Heaven Tome.

It contained 61 formations—20 slaughter formations, 20 protective formations, 10 sealing formations, 10 illusory formations, and one unique formation known as the Initiate Tome.

All of the formations listed in Heaven Tome were ingenious, though the most ingenious one was the formation known as the Initiate Tome. It was a formation deciphering method, but it was highly adaptable and could be used to deal with many different formations. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The more Chu Feng studied the formation, the more engrossed he was in it. He wanted to grasp it right away.

On top of that, he realized that the Heaven Tome was a perfect fit for Qin Jiu’s legacy.

“Was the Heaven Tome created by Elder Qin Jiu?” Chu Feng wondered.

He looked at the other formations too. While it would take him time to grasp them, he could tell that they were highly compatible with Qin Jiu’s legacy too.

There were only two possibilities. Either Qin Jiu had based his formation construction methods on the Heaven Tome, or that he was the creator of the Heaven Tome.

Furthermore, Chu Feng sensed that the Heaven Tome was incomplete—there was a good chance there was a higher-tier Heaven Tome, or else the final formation wouldn’t be called Initiate Tome.

For now, Chu Feng focused on grasping the Initiate Tome, as he thought it would be useful to him. He had a feeling that the means deployed by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was not to be made light of.

The Initiate Tome might be useful to him since it could be used as a counter to many formations.

As for the other daoists, he wasn’t worried about them.

The ocean water had receded, and the restrictions had been lifted. Given Daoist Fifth Dragon’s means, he should be able to locate the other daoists, assuming they were still alive. If those daoists were dead, he wouldn’t be able to help even if he wanted to.

Thus, his priority was to grasp the Initiate Tome.

While Chu Feng was studying the Initiate Tome, a huge commotion broke out in the remnant. The two death immunity tokens had begun crumbling. At the same time, all of the world spiritists could sense the energy receding from the hall.

It was not their first time sensing something like that in this ancient city. The veterans understood what this signified.

Someone had obtained the treasure here.
