Chapter 5269: The Confident Little Monk

Tang Xiu actually admitted defeat!

The crowd was dumbfounded.

“Why did Tang Xiu admit defeat? Were the two of them so close that he’s willing to go to this extent for his friend?”

No one could understand what Tang Xiu was up to. Only Tang Xiu himself knew that he wasn’t a match for Chu Feng at all. He had stood against Chu Feng on the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s side in the Spirit Beast Mountain Range, only to be utterly overpowered.

Were it not for the activation of his protective formation and his mother pleading on his behalf, he would have died on that very day.

He was frustrated at the near-death experience, but at the same time, he was also won over by Chu Feng’s strength. That was why he had maintained a courteous attitude to Chu Feng.

Tang Xiu wasn’t an amicable person. He only showed respect to those whom he acknowledged.

Weng!

The formation sensed Tang Xiu’s admittance of defeat and teleported him away.

At the same time, another surge of teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng and sent him into the tower. He could tell that the tower was indeed the true battlefield for the duel. Had Tang Xiu not surrendered, the two of them would be dishing it out here.

Due to Tang Xiu backing out, Chu Feng was sent to the top of the tower.

“That fellow has advanced to the next stage?”

“He has already moved on to the next stage when the others haven’t even fought yet. How lucky.”

Those who didn’t know the truth expressed their dissatisfaction. They thought that Chu Feng was just lucky.

“Everyone, there’s no need to be too bothered by this. Even if Tang Xiu helped him, there’s no way he’ll win the fight against Ouyang Canjian,” the elder standing in front of the third tower said.

The elder was covered in rune-inscribed bandages, and he was supporting himself with a walking cane. Despite looking to be on the verge of death, he gave off an arrogant feeling.

From the crowd’s chatter, Chu Feng learned that the elder had a formidable background.

The elder’s name was Gong Liangjin, and just like Ouyang Canjian, he was over three thousand years old. He had started suppressing his cultivation from the moment he learned about the Trial of the Strongest all so that he could compete for the title of the strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator.

Amongst the older generation who were beneath Half-God level, he was only second to Ouyang Canjian.

Chu Feng wasn’t too bothered by Gong Liangjin’s comments, but he did hope that the latter could advance to the next stage so that he could defeat him with his own hands.

Just then, the elder with a veiled bamboo hat whom Chu Feng had encountered earlier arrived in the vicinity.

Weng!

The fifth tower swiftly enveloped the elder with a surge of teleportation energy and brought him to its entrance. Following that, the voice of the Totem Dragon Clan’s elder boomed from the sky.

“Everyone, the fight to determine the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator hereby commences. I shan’t bother introducing the rules once more. The last one standing will be able to acquire the strongest token. The others will also receive rewards according to their rankings. So, bring out your true capability, defeat your opponent, and rise as far as you can!”

Following the announcement, the challengers began entering the tower.

Just then, the little monk suddenly asked aloud, “May I ask if anyone has managed to clear the earlier test?”

The little monk glanced at those standing in front of the tower gates, but no one answered him. Even his opponent Mo Yuhan entered the tower straight without paying him any heed.

“How impolite. Why am I not surprised at all?” The little monk smiled to himself, not offended by their attitude.

“Are you referring to the test in the ancient hall?” Chu Feng asked.

The little monk raised his head to look at Chu Feng. “Yes, that’s the one I’m referring to. Did you clear it?”

“I did,” Chu Feng replied.

“Oh?” The little monk frowned upon hearing those words.

“How can you prove it?” the little monk asked.

“I don’t need to. Take it or leave it,” Chu Feng replied.

“You have spunk. I trust you. It looks like you’ll be my opponent,” the little monk said.

“You sure are confident,” Chu Feng replied.

“That young miss is your friend?” the little monk asked.

Chu Feng’s eyes turned cold. “What do you mean by that?”

“Don’t worry. I’ll go easy on her since she’s your friend.” After saying those words, the monk entered the tower with an air of confidence.

The gates to all of the towers slammed shut. The duels had begun.

“Chu Feng, I do hope that you get a chance to fight with the little monk,” Eggy said.

“Oh? What makes you say that?” Chu Feng asked.

“I think he needs a beating,” Eggy said.

“I hope that I’ll get to duel with Mo Yuhan instead,” Chu Feng said.

“Why?” Eggy asked.

“I’d rather she claim the second place than an outsider,” Chu Feng said.

“True. I’m rather fond of her too,” Eggy said.

Weng!

A surge of teleportation energy suddenly flared from the first tower, and Ouyang Canjian emerged at the peak of the tower.

“How did Ouyang Canjian suddenly get there? Don’t tell that he has already won his duel?”

The crowd stared at Ouyang Canjian in confusion.

Bam!

The tightly shut gates of the first tower slammed open, and a person was teleported out. It was Ouyang Canjian’s opponent, just that there was a deep sword gash in his chest.

“Thank you for sparing my life,” that person clasped his fist at Ouyang Canjian and said.

Ouyang Canjian didn’t answer, but the crowd was shocked to hear those words. The duel ended barely seconds after it began. Was this how powerful Ouyang Canjian was?

Weng!

The gates of another tower opened. The loser was teleported out whereas the victor was teleported to the peak of the tower.

It was Xu Tianjian. He had defeated his opponent too.

“As expected of Xu Tianjian. He doesn’t pale in comparison to Ouyang Canjian at all. It looks like they’ll be the ones in the final showdown.”

The crowd clenched their fists in excitement. Even though they weren’t given the chance to fight in the towers, they were thrilled to be able to witness the showdown in person.

In the depths of the mountain range was a majestic palace with a complicated formation. This was the formation that allowed the Totem Dragon Clan to perceive the happenings inside the trial. To be exact, they weren’t able to see any of the participants or the fights. All they were notified of were the results of the duels.

Even so, the experts of the Totem Dragon Clan were still gathered around the formation. The elder who had declared the commencement of the tournament was amongst them too.

“Haa! If only we’re able to see the fights too,” the elder said.

“We should be glad that the formation is working. After all, this is the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant we’re dealing with,” a voice suddenly echoed from behind.

Following that, Long Zhen of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors walked up to them.

“Paying respects to Lord Long Zhen.”

The crowd hurriedly bowed to Long Zhen, including the elder who had been hosting the tournament. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Lord Long Zhen, what brings you here? Is there a hiccup in the opening of the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant?” the elder stepped forward and asked.

He knew that Lord Long Zhen and the others were guarding the sphere that held the key to opening the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant. It was unlikely that Lord Long Zhen would suddenly come here without a reason.

“There has indeed been a hiccup. Unfortunately, only the late Martial Exalted level test has been cleared, so I came here to see how their battles are going,” Long Zhen said as he glanced at the formation.

The proceedings for all four fields were the same, but only the late Martial Exalted level had reached the final tower duels.

“How long has it been since the duels began?” Long Zhen asked.

“It has only just begun,” the elder said.

“Three people have already won even though the duels have only just begun?”

Through the formation, Long Zhen was able to see the eight towers, and there were already three names on top of the towers. They were Ouyang Canjian, Chu Feng, and Xu Tianjian.

“Who’s Chu Feng? How did he win the duel that quickly?” Long Zhen asked.

He wasn’t surprised that Ouyang Canjian and Xu Tianjian were able to take down their opponents that quickly, but this was the first time he had heard of Chu Feng’s name.

“Milord, Ouyang Canjian and Xu Tianjian have won their respective duels normally, but Chu Feng’s opponent admitted defeat even before the fight began,” the elder replied.

“Admitted defeat? Why?” Ouyang Canjian asked.

“Milord, the opening of the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant has shaken up our formation so much that we don’t know what’s happening inside. We can only see the outcome. Due to that, we don’t know why Chu Feng’s opponent has admitted defeat. However, we do know that Chu Feng’s opponent was a junior named Tang Xiu,” the elder reported.

“Tang Xiu? His name sounds familiar,” Long Zhen said.

“Milord, Tang Xiu is one of the most talented prodigies amongst the juniors,” the elder said.
