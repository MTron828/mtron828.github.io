Chapter 3834 - The Great Emperor’s Soul Remains

The palace hall was extremely vast, inestimably vast. It was simply as vast as an entire world.

However, the only things inside that enormously vast palace hall were candles emitting faint light scattered all around.

Those faint lights were simply unable to illuminate the vast palace hall.

Thus, the palace hall was extremely dusky. Generally, dusky locations would give off a feeling of strangeness and unease.

However, it was different for the palace hall.

There was not only no trace of strangeness in the palace hall, but it was instead filled with a sacred and imposing aura. Without a doubt, that palace hall was a sacred place.

“Buzz~~”

Suddenly, a spirit formation gate appeared out of thin air. It had appeared in the palace hall.

Following that, a figure fell out of the spirit formation gate.

That’s right, that person had fallen out of the gate. Once he fell out the spirit formation gate, he lay directly on the ground.

His clothes were all tattered. His body was covered in blood. There were cuts all over his flesh, leaving him badly mangled. He seemed like he had experienced some sort of cruel torture.

“Did I finally succeed?”

Although covered in bruises, that person did not let out the slightest scream of pain. Instead, he had a smile of enormous excitement on his face.

That person was none other than Chu Feng.

After Chu Feng entered that inheritance gate, what he was confronted with was not a mountain of daggers and a sea of flames. Instead, he had truly entered the gates of hell.

There were layers upon layers of obstacles. Each and every one of them were torturous ordeals.

However, evidently, although Chu Feng was seriously injured, he had managed to pass the difficulties.

At that moment, Chu Feng gathered his strength to stand up.

However, with a putt, he fell back onto his stomach.

He was actually unable to stand up!

He was simply too badly weakened. It was not his body that was weak. Instead, it was his soul.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, a ray of light descended from the sky and enveloped Chu Feng.

Being enveloped by that light, Chu Feng’s body began to change.

The wounds on his body began to rapidly heal. Even his tattered clothes began to restore themselves. Chu Feng’s injured soul was also fully healed.

Chu Feng was overjoyed by this sudden change.

He knew how serious his injuries were.

As a world spiritist, he knew very well how difficult it was to recover from injuries that serious.

However, injuries that serious were actually cured in the blink of an eye.

The power that had cured him was simply unimaginably strong, simply something that he had never before seen.

“Woosh~~~”

Chu Feng suddenly stood up and looked deep into the palace hall.

His firm gaze was filled with complicated emotions.

“Thank you senior.”

Soon, Chu Feng clasped his fist and bowed.

Chu Feng was able to sense that the miraculous power that had treated his injuries had been unleashed by someone.

Furthermore, the person that had unleashed that power was located deep in the palace hall.

Unfortunately, the palace hall was simply too dusky. The depths of the palace hall were simply pitch-black. Chu Feng was unable to see the figure of that person.

“To be able to reach this place, you’re quite competent.”

After Chu Feng spoke, an aged voice sounded.

Following that, a series of footsteps began to approach Chu Feng.

Chu Feng knew that the person was walking toward him.

Chu Feng did not dare to show any disrespect, and did not dare to rashly advance either. Thus, he stood there and continued to hold a respectful posture as he waited for that person to arrive.

Chu Feng was greatly looking forward to meeting that person.

He knew that the person he was about to meet was most definitely an extremely powerful individual.

That person might be more powerful than anyone he had ever met before.

Thus, Chu Feng wanted to know exactly who that person might be.

Finally, a figure walked out from the darkness and appeared in the dusky palace hall.

Even though the light was extremely faint, Chu Feng was still able to clearly see that person’s appearance.

However, when Chu Feng saw that person, his expression changed greatly. A faint look of surprise appeared in his eyes.

That voice had clearly come from an aged individual.

However, the person who had appeared before Chu Feng was a middle-aged man in his prime.

That middle-aged man had a pair of deep eyes. Those were eyes that could only be obtained through the experience of countless years.

Although he had the look of a middle-aged man, it was unable to conceal his handsome appearance.

His shaggy, light-colored beard caused him to appear rather rough and tough.

That man was actually a spirit body.

Yet, he carried a giant sword on his back.

Although he was a spirit body, that giant sword was an actual sword.

The sword was a meter wide and three meters long. It was truly enormous.

The giant sword was bronze in color. It appeared very heavy. Although that sword was covered in rust spots and seemed to be nothing but a trash sword, Chu Feng felt as if he was seeing an aged old general when he saw the sword.

Although the sword was now covered in rust and was no longer as imposing as it used to be, Chu Feng could imagine from the scars and dents that covered the sword’s body how bold and powerful of a sword it was in the past.

Suddenly, Chu Feng bent his back. “This junior pays his respect to the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.”

Chu Feng spoke with a loud yet extremely humble tone.

“Mn? How did you know that I’m the Great Monster Slayer Emperor?” Even that middle-aged man was surprised to hear Chu Feng address him as such.

However, his answer had confirmed that Chu Feng’s address was correct.

“This junior had no basis for it. It is all purely because of my feeling and intuition.”

“Although senior is in spirit form, senior’s aura is extremely powerful. Furthermore, everything inside this place is under senior’s rule.”

“The spirit formations of this place are extremely powerful and profound. To be able to unleash the aura of a ruler in this place, this junior suspects that only its master, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor, would be capable of such a feat," said Chu Feng.

“Hahaha. Boy, you know how to speak.”

“However, this old man’s actual body has long since died. I am nothing more than a remnant spirit. To be exact, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor has long since died. This old man cannot be considered to be the Great Monster Slayer Emperor from back then.”

The Great Monster Slayer Emperor smiled profoundly. Then, he said, “You’ve surmounted all sorts of difficulties to reach this place. All of it has been witnessed by this old man.”

“You are qualified to receive this old man’s inheritance. However, as to whether or not you can receive it, it’ll depend on your own capability.”

As the Great Monster Slayer Emperor spoke, he waved his sleeve, and four scrolls appeared before Chu Feng.

Seeing the colors of the scrolls, Chu Feng knew that they were all Exalted Taboo Martial Skills.

Furthermore, from their color, Chu Feng determined that they should be three rank two Exalted Taboo Martial Skills and one rank three Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

“It would appear that those are not enticing for you.”

“Then, what about this?”

The Great Monster Slayer Emperor smiled. Then, he waved his arm again.

Another item appeared before him. It was a blue gem.

The gem was only pearl-sized. However, it had a very peculiar shape. The gem seemed to be a sculpture of a cultivator sitting cross-legged.

Generally, gems in this sort of appearance would be carved artificially.

However, this gem showed no sign of being carved. Instead, it seemed to naturally be like that.

The instant Chu Feng saw the blue gem, his heart started trembling. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Chu Feng was able to sense something extremely profound from the gem.

It was something that would give enormous assistance toward one’s world spirit power.

“Could this be the treasure that the Mystic Cave Saints spoke of?”

This thought came to Chu Feng’s heart. Chu Feng felt that the profoundness contained in blue gem was capable of allowing him to reach a breakthrough into Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

Should Chu Feng become a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, not only would his world spirit techniques improve, but he would also gain Utmost Exalted-level battle power.
