Chapter 5831: Laying a Trap

“200 million sycees? Why did the price suddenly hike so much? How in the world is that item worth 200 million?”

It was such a ridiculous bid that everyone’s mind went blank for a brief moment. This exceeded a reasonable price for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip.

However, someone quickly realized that something was amiss.

“That voice... It’s the mysterious individual who resonated with the Junior Blessing Formation!”

“He repaired the formation bead within a short time when even the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild was at a loss as to what to do, which shows how sharp his eyes are. Does he think there’s a real God Bestowment Bamboo Slip inside that fragment?”

“That would explain his high bid.”

Chu Feng was indeed the one who bid 200 million. He had altered his voice, but he used the same altered voice throughout the auction, so others recognized him.

Those who recognized his voice felt tempted to join the bid, but the price was too high and they didn’t have the financial power to compete.

“Lord Saint-tier elder.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elders looked at their Jie Yefeng. Since they were able to arrive at this conclusion, Jie Yefeng was bound to have figured as much too.

However, Jie Yefeng shook his head and said, “We won’t pay anything more than 100 million sycees.”

The other elders dared not say anything upon seeing how adamant he was on this matter. They were just lackeys here; Jie Yefeng was the one who called the shots.

250 million!!” the young man bidded.

“250 million? Isn’t he too wealthy? Is he certain there’s a God Bestowment Bamboo Slip inside there too?”

Seeing how determined the young man was, the crowd was starting to become convinced of this fact.

“300 million,” Chu Feng said.

The young man didn’t hike up the price right away. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Is there anyone who would like to bid? If not, we’ll be auctioning off this God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment for 300 million sycees. 3... 2...”

As the beautiful elder began counting down, the young man spoke up, “301 million.”

Chu Feng’s lips crept into a smile.

“Brother Chu Feng, why aren’t you bidding anymore? Go ahead and bid whatever you like. I’ll cover whatever you’re lacking. You can take the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip with you,” Xianhai Shaoyu quickly spoke up.

He thought Chu Feng had stopped bidding because he didn’t have enough money.

“Brother Shaoyu, just how rich does one have to be to spend 300 million sycees to buy an ordinary bamboo slip?” Chu Feng asked.

“An ordinary bamboo slip? Y-you’re saying what’s inside the fragment is just an ordinary bamboo slip?” Xianhai Shaoyu was taken aback.

Even Little Fishy’s eyes were widened. “Big brother, you can tell?”

“I think the second legend is more accurate. The God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragments are created to dupe others, and the one behind it is the World Spiritist Emperor,” Chu Feng said.

“World Spiritist Emperor? The strongest world spiritist in the Ancient Era?”

Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy had heard about the World Spiritist Emperor Qin Jiu.

“Yes. I stumbled upon his legacy by a stroke of coincidence, so I’m familiar with his means. The God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragments look to be his doing. Furthermore, I have the real God Bestowment Bamboo Slip with me, so I can tell what’s inside the fragment is just an ordinary bamboo slip,” Chu Feng said.

“So... you intentionally bid up the price. You’re just trying to screw that fellow over.” Xianhai Shaoyu finally understood what was going on.

Chu Feng responded with a smile.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re a bad person, but I like it!” Xianhai Shaoyu revealed an evil smile.

“Good job! Those people need to be punished! Big brother, you’re incredible!” Little Fishy happily complimented Chu Feng, but she quickly turned to Xianhai Shaoyu and said, “Why are you smiling like that? You look lecherous.”

“It’s not your first day knowing me. Can’t I reveal my true self before you and Brother Chu Feng?” Xiaohai Shaoyu grumbled.

“Of course you can,” Chu Feng replied.

Little Fishy quickly pulled Chu Feng away from Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Big brother, you need to be careful of my brother. He’s a pervert. He watches plenty of... terrible stuff,” Little Fishy said.

“I know,” Chu Feng replied.

“...” Little Fishy was rendered speechless.

Xianhai Shaoyu was the one who broke the silence. “Do you think they have already reached their limit and can’t bid any higher?”

“Indeed. We’ll be screwing ourselves over if we continue bidding,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re truly a terrifying one.” Xianhai Shaoyu’s evil became even more evil.

The God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment was the centerpiece of the auction, so it was the last item to be presented. Once it was sold, the auction concluded.

The door of Chu Feng’s compartment suddenly opened, and the beautiful elder walked in. “Milord, our managing elder invites you over.”

“Is there a problem?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s regarding the Junior Blessing Formation,” the beautiful elder replied.

“I’ll be troubling you to lead the way.” Chu Feng and the others followed the beautiful elder out.

The other guests were also leaving their respective compartments to exit the venue. Coincidentally, the ones closest to Chu Feng were world spiritists dressed in rucksack-like world spiritist cloaks. It was the young man’s group.

“You were the one who competed with me earlier, right? Why did you stop bidding? No more money? Why bother competing with me if that’s all you have?” the young man sneered upon seeing Chu Feng.

He was harboring a grudge for what happened earlier, so he was using this opportunity to mock Chu Feng.

A few people in the crowd noticed their conflict and lingered around. Even people of high standing were interested in such commotions.

“I’m indeed not as rich as you. I wouldn’t spend 301 million sycees just to buy an ordinary bamboo slip,” Chu Feng replied.

An uproar broke out in the crowd. “An ordinary bamboo slip?”

“Am I hearing things? Is he saying that the fragment contains an ordinary bamboo slip?”

More and more people crowded around upon hearing those words. Those who had left rushed back into the venue. Even those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion watched the situation from afar.

The young man would be truly pitiful if the fragment contained an ordinary bamboo slip.

Chu Feng turned to the beautiful elder and asked, “Elder, items that have been auctioned off can’t be refunded, right?”

“Indeed,” the beautiful elder replied.

“That’s good to hear.” Chu Feng smiled.

The young man angrily roared at Chu Feng, “What a joke! Just because you say the fragment contains an ordinary bamboo slip doesn’t mean that’s the case. Do you think you possess special eyes that can see what others can’t?”

“Open it then. You’ll get your answer,” Chu Feng said.

“Fine, I’ll open it.”

The young man took out the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment from its box and began constructing a removal formation. Soon, the special layer enveloping the fragment started to dissipate, revealing its true form.

The young man and his companions froze up. What was inside the fragment was truly just a normal bamboo slip. There was nothing special about it other than the fact that it was from the Ancient Era.
