Chapter 5753: As If a Bandit

“Miss Yu’er is amazing. She drove away Jie Tian just like that?”

“Ey, I was too focused on cultivating last night that I needed a short rest after the cultivation ground closed. To think I’d miss a good show just like that,” Long Chengyu said regretfully.

Just then, Huangfu Jiangyao’s voice sounded, “I’ll give you a chance to watch a good show.”

The crowd turned their eyes over. The five Huangfus had appeared once more.

“Who are you?” Long Chengyu asked.

He wasn’t around when the five Huangfus appeared earlier, so he didn’t recognize them.

“They are the five Huangfus,” Chu Feng replied.

“It’s them?” Long Chengyu earnestly assessed the five Huangfus as he asked, “What’s the good show you speak of?”

“Do you know why the Nine Heavens’ Zenith hasn’t commenced yet?” Huangfu Jiangyao asked.

“Why?” Long Chengyu asked.

“It’s because of the cultivation ground. It’s intended not just to support our cultivation but to assess our qualifications too. Until its requirement has been met, the Nine Heavens’ Zenith will not commence. Our young master has been trying to decipher the formation every night, and he’ll likely succeed tomorrow.

“Our young master’s initial plan was to unlock the Nine Heavens’ Zenith and show you the gap between us, but it looks like some of you can’t wait for the action, so he decided to bring forward the plan and make you despair in advance,” Huangfu Jiangyao said.

“Are you still asleep? What’s with all that babble?” the fiery-tempered Long Chengyu replied impatiently.

Huangfu Jiangyao reached into his Cosmos Sack, pulled out a huge copper gong, and struck it.

Clang!

A metallic sound reverberated. The sound was so piercing that even those in their residence would have heard it.

“Come out. We’ll show you a true prodigy,” Huangfu Jiangyao declared, with his voice surprisingly echoing through the copper gong.

Many people stepped out of their residence and gathered in the square.

“We’ll grant you the chance to challenge us today. There won’t be any punishments if we win, but we’ll reward you if you somehow defeat us,” Huangfu Jiangyao said before glancing at the average-looking man.

The average-looking man leaped onto the dueling ring and clasped his fist at the crowd, saying, “I am Huangfu Fanni from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan.”

“Big brother, let’s eat. I’ll cook for you,” Little Fishy told Chu Feng, indicating that she wasn’t interested in this.

As soon as Little Fishy said those words, Huangfu Fanni turned to Little Fishy and said, “I want to challenge Xianhai Yu’er.”

“He actually dares to challenge Xianhai Yu’er. Does he not know how powerful she is?”

The crowd was taken aback. Even the Huangfus were stunned as well.

“What are you doing, Huangfu Fanni? I was going to challenge Xianhai Yu’er,” Huangfu Jiangyao said.

“Young master Jiangyao, please permit my willfulness this once. I wish to prove myself here,” Huangfu Fanni subserviently bowed to Huangfu Jiangyao as he pleaded. It could be seen that he was fearful of Huangfu Jiangyao.

“Fine,” Huangfu Jiangyao impatiently replied.

“Why should I accept your challenge?” Xianhai Yu’er snorted in disinterest as she began pulling Chu Feng away with her.

Just then, Huangfu Fanni took out a lightning pearl that immediately drew everyone’s attention, including that of Chu Feng, Little Fishy, and the others. He lifted it up high and told Little Fishy, “This ancient treasure is highly beneficial to those with the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline. You can have it if you win.”

Shoosh!

Little Fishy leaped onto the dueling ring and stood face to face with Huangfu Fanni. She stretched her hand forth and said, “Don’t make me beat you up. Give it to me.”

“I know you’re strong, Xianhai Yu’er, but I challenged you here to prove my strength to everyone here… Uwa!”

As soon as Huangfu Fanni finished his words, Little Fishy sunk her fist into abdomen, causing him to kneel on the floor and reel over in pain.

Unwilling to accept his defeat, Huangfu Fanni summoned the Lightning Mark, raising his cultivation to rank seven Half-God level, but the pain was still too much for him to return to his feet.

So, he summoned the Lightning Armor too, further raising his cultivation to rank eight Half-God level, but he was still unable to get to his feet. In fact, his Lightning Armor swiftly dissipated due to the intense pain. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Even his Lightning Mark flickered, looking as if it would fade at any moment.

“Just surrender. I don’t want to beat you up.” Little Fishy raised her hand, and Huangfu Fanni’s lightning pearl fell into her grasp. She took the pearl to Chu Feng and said, “This is for you, big brother.”

“This seems to be worth a lot,” Chu Feng remarked.

“It should be useful to you,” Little Fishy said.

“It is.” Chu Feng accepted the gift without any hesitation, knowing that Little Fishy wouldn’t take no for an answer. “Thank you, Little Fishy.”

“There’s no need to be so courteous with me. Big brother, why don’t we stay here a little longer? They might bring out other treasures too. I’ll get them for you,” Little Fishy said.

The crowd looked conflicted. It sounded as if Little Fishy was plundering from the Huangfus, though they had to admit that she had the strength to back her words up! That was how strong she was.

“I’m fine with that,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

The brawny, nine-meters tall Huangfu leaped onto the dueling ring. He kicked Huangfu Fanni off the stage with a scoff, “You embarrassment.”

“Pick me, pick me.” Little Fishy waved her hand.

The brawny Huangfu saw the excited Little Fishy but frowned. He quickly turned his attention toward Qin Xuan and said, “I’ll challenge you.”

“I have no reason to accept your challenge,” Qin Xuan replied.

The brawny Huangfu flicked his wrist and took out a pearl suffusing with unique energy. Qin Xuan’s eyes lit up at the sight of the bead. He had never seen such treasure despite being the most talented junior in the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.

The energy inside the pearl was extremely beneficial to those who practiced mysterious skills, to the point that he felt as if it was made just for him.
