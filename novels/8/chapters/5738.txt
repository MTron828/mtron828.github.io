Chapter 5738: The Prodigy From the Nine Souls Galaxy

A woman with a voluptuous figure stood at the center of the square.

“It’s the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Qin Guangwei! I heard she has a bad temper, and it does appear to be the case.”

“Isn’t she afraid of trouble?”

“What’s there to be afraid of? I doubt there’s even a Half-God level cultivator in that deserted Nine Souls Galaxy. I reckon only a handful of their juniors have reached Martial Exalted level.”

“Xian Miaomiao is nothing to be feared. I’m talking about others in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. Xian Miaomiao was invited here by the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, after all. Will they simply watch as Qin Guangwei provokes her?”

“Just continue watching. You’ll know the answer soon.”

“True.”

More and more people gathered in the area, hoping to see if Qin Guangwei would bring trouble upon themselves.

This square was a common area that everyone would pass through when entering or exiting their respective spirit realms. The area was shrouded in a white fog that even world spiritists couldn’t peer through.

However, there were a couple of glowing red words to be seen amidst the fog—’Qin Xuan’, ‘Feng Ling’, ‘Xianhai Yu’er’, ‘Wang Qiang’, ‘Jie Tian’, and ‘Xian Miaomiao’. These were the people invited to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, and they had special plaques to indicate them.

It was due to that that everyone knew where Xian Miaomiao resided.

“The red light has gone out!”

Excited mumbles could be heard from the crowd. This suggested that Xian Miaomiao might have just left her spirit realm and was making her way to the square.

Soon enough, a silhouette could be seen emerging from the fog. The crowd’s eyes lit up.

“My… Is that Xian Miaomiao? She’s ravishing!”

Yellow hair, blue eyes, and sharp ears—the woman before them was from a monstrous beast clan. However, she was incredibly beautiful, from her delicate facial features to her blue eyes that carried nobility that even humans didn’t possess.

She was Xian Miaomiao.

There were many beautiful women here too. Some of them were born that way, but there were also those who employed a world spiritist to make them look more perfect. Thus, there wasn't anyone who truly looked terrible in the square.

Yet, every single one of them dulled in comparison to Xian Miaomiao. They weren’t on the same level at all.

“Putting aside her strength, how in the world is she that beautiful?”

Even the arrogant prodigies couldn’t help but compliment Xian Miaomiao’s looks. Some even began salivating like fools.

Qin Shu, who was from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect too, assessed Xian Miaomiao from head to toe, then toe back to head. The more he looked at her, the more fond he was of her.

“It’d be great if I could take her in as my servant,” Qin Shu mumbled.

Qin Shu was Qin Xuan’s younger brother, but he wasn’t a good person. Back in the Ancient Realm, he worked with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s Jia Chengying and the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Zhou Dong to make things difficult for Chu Feng at every turn.

Chu Feng met him in the Ancient Realm.

Later on, when the Bluemoon Sacred Palace attacked the Ancient Realm, he was allowed to safely leave in view of his background. That incident spurred him to work harder upon returning to the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, and he advanced his cultivation considerably.

He was even in tenth place for the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s test.

However, his personality was still as horrendous as ever. As a matter of fact, he was the one who put Qin Guangwei up to provoking Xian Miaomiao.

“You called for me?” Xian Miaomiao glanced at Qin Guangwei with a sweet and obedient smile, looking like a kind neighbor’s daughter.

“You’re the Nine Souls Galaxy’s Xian Miaomiao? What rights do you have to be invited by the Nine Heavens’ Zenith?” Qin Guangwei asked.

“Are you doubting me?” Xian Miaomiao asked.

“Hah… I’m not the only one doubting you. Look around. Everyone here doubts your qualifications. Your Nine Souls Galaxy isn’t even a match for our Heavenly Dome Galaxy’s Lower Realms, so you are…” Qin Weiguang’s taunt suddenly halted halfway through.

There was a dueling ring by the corner of the square, and Xian Miaomiao had just stepped on it.

“Come up,” Xian Miaomiao said.

Qin Guangwei was taken aback, but she quickly burst into laughter. Her expression turned vile, and her eyes were so sinister that it looked as if she was going to murder Xian Miaomiao. “You hear her! She’s the one who challenged me here.”

She flitted up onto the stage.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Boom!

A strong oppressive might suffused the dueling ring, causing the dueling ring to tremble. It was fortunate there was a barrier around the dueling ring preventing aftershocks from rippling out, or else some of the prodigies present would sustain injuries from it.

“She went all out right away. Isn’t Qin Weiguang going overboard?”

The crowd discussed amongst themselves. They could tell that the aftershock had come from a rank five Half-God level cultivator.

Qin Weiguang was at rank three Half-God level. If she could raise her cultivation by two ranks, she could most definitely exert the strength of a rank five Half-God level cultivator. However, the fact that she went all out right away showed that she intended to take Xian Miaomiao’s life.

“How could this be?”

The shockwave finally settled down, granting the crowd a better view of the dueling ring, but the scene that welcomed them was different from what they had expected.

Qin Weiguang was lying on the ground, her chest crushed under Xian Miaomiao’s foot. She was already unconscious, but she profusely spewed blood, and her body twitched nonstop.

The oppressive might that was exerted earlier was indeed from a rank five Half-God level cultivator, but it had come not from Qin Weiguang but Xian Miaomiao. Furthermore, Xian Miaomiao hadn’t undergone any transformations, meaning this was her base cultivation.

“Rank five Half-God! She’s actually at rank five Half-God!”

The crowd was taken aback. With her cultivation level, she could easily crush most of the prodigies present. She definitely had the right to be invited to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. But when did such a monster emerge from the Nine Souls Galaxy?

Shoosh!

Just then, Xian Miaomiao picked up Qin Weiguang and tossed her toward the Heavenly Dome Immortal Clansmen. She looked at the crowd with a sweet smile and asked, “Does anyone else harbor doubt about my qualifications?”

Her voice was gentle and euphonious, but no one dared to make light of her.
