Chapter 4301 - Searching For Power

“Shaoyu, your fourth uncle belongs to the Demon Morph Clan.”

“I possess my baseline. I cannot tell you,” said Xianhai Renhu.

“Fourth uncle, this Holy Light Galaxy is deemed as the place where the weak live. No powerful individuals are willing to come to this place.”

“Your Demon Morph Clan has always been pursuing power. The places that you all proceeded to were all places with hidden remnants or treasures.”

“For you all to muster such a large force to come to this place, I am certain that you all are here with a purpose in mind.”

“Fourth uncle, tell me what it is. I will definitely not tell anyone else.”

“Fourth uncle, do you not trust me?” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

Hearing those words, Xianhai Renhu hesitated.

Seeing how he was struggling, one could tell that he cared about Xianhai Shaoyu a whole lot.

“Sigh, I truly don’t know what to do with you. But, Shaoyu, you must keep this matter confidential. Else, your fourth uncle I will be in deep trouble.”

Then, Xianhai Renhu actually informed Xianhai Shaoyu their purpose in coming to this place.

The Demon Morph Clan was originally called the Yuwen Heavenly Clan.

They were once deemed the strongest Heavenly Clan in the entire martial cultivation world.

They were the overlord of the Bloodline Galaxy.

Later on, they were overthrown by the joint effort of the other powers on the Bloodline Galaxy and expelled from the Bloodline Galaxy.

From that point on, the Yuwen Heavenly Clan renamed themselves as the Demon Morph Clan.

No one knew why they decided to change their name.

But, after they changed their name to Demon Morph Clan, their strength continued to increase.

On top of that, as the Demon Morph Clan began to accept the powerful experts from all over the vast martial cultivation realm to join their tanks, the overall strength of the Demon Morph Clan continued to expand.

In addition, the Demon Morph Clan was willing to do anything for the sake of power and treasures. Their methods were also rather cruel.

As time passed, the Demon Morph Clan became notorious throughout the vast martial cultivation world. They became a power that everyone feared.

While the Demon Morph Clan had never had any conflict with the strongest powers in the martial cultivation world, there were people that reckoned the current Demon Morph Clan to have long surpassed the strength of the Yuwen Heavenly Clan in their peak.

If they wanted to, they were more than capable of seizing back the Bloodline Galaxy’s overlord status.

There were some rumors as to why they did not return to the Bloodline Galaxy to seize back their overlord status.

It was rumored that after the Demon Morph Clan grew more powerful, their ambitions were no longer limited to being the ruler of a single galaxy. Instead, they wanted to rule over the entire martial cultivation world.

Because of that, they have been searching for treasures, resources and powers that could allow their Demon Morph Clan to become even stronger.

The reason why the Demon Morph Clan arrived at the Holy Light Galaxy was because they’ve received clues that the Holy Light Galaxy contained what they sought.

If they obtained that power, the overall strength of the Demon Morph Clan will obtain an intrinsic increase.

The Demon Morph Clan will then possess the power to realize their ultimate goal.

“Fourth uncle, exactly what is that power the Demon Morph Clan is seeking?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

He was feeling increasingly uneasy.

He long knew the Demon Morph Clan to be an unstable factor in the martial cultivation world.

If the Demon Morph Clan really obtained the power they yearned for day and night, the consequences would be unthinkable.

The entire martial cultivation world will most definitely enter a period of bloody turmoil because of the Demon Morph Clan.

“It is a power that could evolve Heavenly Bloodline,” said Xianhai Renhu.

“Evolve Heavenly Bloodline?”

“Wasn’t the Yuwen Heavenly Clan the strongest Heavenly Clan in the entire martial cultivation world to begin with?”

“Could it be that their Heavenly Bloodline hasn’t reached the peak yet?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Of course not,” said Xianhai Renhu.

Hearing that, Xianhai Shaoyu frowned again.

The Yuwen Heavenly Clan was not weak to begin with. They were said to be a clan that had managed to bright forth the powers of their Heavenly Bloodline to a pinnacle level.

If they were able to strengthen their Heavenly Bloodline again, things would truly be terrifying.

It would also become a threat to their Immortal Sea Fish Clan. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“In that case, did they manage to discover that power?” asked Xianhai Shaoyu.

“The Demon Morph Clan’s Clan Chief had personally led the top experts within the clan to this place ahead of time.”

“But, in all likelihood, they would not be able to find that power so quickly. Furthermore, finding it is most definitely not an easy task.”

“But... they are determined to obtain that power. If necessary, they would adopt extreme means,” said Xianhai Renhu.

“Extreme means?”

“Could it be...”

Xianhai Shaoyu’s expression changed. His unease was clearly visible on his face.

“It is as you imagined. Unless they find that power, the entire Holy Light Galaxy will be turned upside down.”

“Thus, Shaoyu, you must quickly leave this place. This Holy Light Galaxy will become the most chaotic and most dangerous place in the entire martial cultivation world,” said Xianhai Renhu.

“Fourth uncle, was it my father’s decision to have you join the Demon Morph Clan?”

“I’ve never believed that you will betray our clan,” said Xianhai Shaoyu.

Xianhai Renhu smiled at that question but didn’t answer. After smiling, he said, “Go ahead and leave this place. Bring your friend away too.”

“Else, if the other experts from the Demon Morph Clan arrives, I will not be able to release the two of you that easily.”

Hearing that, Xianhai Shaoyu stopped hesitating. Even though he had a lot more questions and a lot more things to say to his fourth uncle, he knew that he must leave.

Thus, he supported the unconscious Chu Feng and planned to leave this place.

But, right when Xianhai Shaoyu was about to leave, Xianhai Renhu suddenly spoke, “Shaoyu, wait.”

“What’s wrong, fourth uncle?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“While there’s a protective formation on you that could protect you, its powers are ultimately limited. Furthermore, once triggered, it will also injure you in the process.”

“I’ve heard that your father has been trying to improve the protective formation on you all these years. While the protective formation has been strengthened the entire time, it has never reached a point where it will not bring you harm.”

“Truth is, your fourth uncle has been thinking of ways to improve the protective formation too.”

“It just so happened that in recent days, I’ve obtained an item. That iem is able to perfectly fuse with our Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s bloodline.”

“Fuse this item with your protective formation. Not only will your protective formation be strengthened, it will also not cause you any injuries once triggered,” Xianhai Renhu took out an item from his Cosmos Sack.

It was an irregular-shaped metallic object the size of a fingernail.

While it doesn’t look like it, Xianhai Shaoyu was able to tell from a single glance that it was a rare treasure.

“Thank you fourth uncle,” Xianhai Shaoyu extended his hand to accept the item.

But, Xianhai Renhu said, “Shaoyu, let your fourth uncle help you.”

“Right now?” Xianhai Shaoyu was slightly hesitant.

“Shaoyu, you couldn’t possibly distrust your fourth uncle, right?” asked Xianhai Renhu.

“How could I? Fourth uncle has always been the person I trust the most.”

Xianhai Shaoyu smiled. Then, he undid his clothes and revealed his protective formation to Xianhai Renhu.

Xianhai Renhu did not hesitate either. Carefully, he assimilated that treasure into Xianhai Shaoyu.

“Wuuu---”

Once the treasure entered his body, Xianhai Shaoyu started feeling pain.

The pain continued to increase. Soon, Xianhai Shaoyu was in so much pain that he was unable to stand that he started crouching.

It was so much that he had to place Chu Feng aside.

“Shaoyu, endure. You will soon feel better.”

“Didn’t you always think that protective formation is a barrier to your growth?”

“Soon, it will disappear from your body. Fourth uncle will have helped you remove a knot in your heart.”

While Xianhai Shaoyu was in pain, Xianhai Renhu’s voice sounded.

But, hearing those words, Xianhai Shaoyu realized that things were fishy.

He raised his head and his expression immediately changed.

“Fourth uncle, could it be that you...”

Seeing the current Xianhai Renhu, Xianhao Shaoyu grew even more uneasy.

He had realized that Xianhai Renhu was looking at him with a massive grin on his face.

That smile was so very sinister and cunning...

It was completely different from the fourth uncle that he knew.

Xianhai Shaoyu suddenly realized that he... had been duped.
