Chapter 5915: Tan Yu’s Family

“Are you Tan Yu?” Chu Feng asked.

The man was surprised. He hesitantly nodded and asked, “How did you know?”

“Zhao Pei told me,” Chu Feng replied.

Zhao Pei was the old man who revealed the whereabouts of the surviving Tan Clansmen to him, as well as their names.

“Milord, you’re acquainted with Elder Zhao?” The man nodded.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

“I see. I’m not related to the Tan Clan anymore, but I’m grateful to you for relaying the news to me. Pardon me for my impoverished living conditions. I don’t have anything to host the two of you. If you don’t mind, would you like to have a cup of tea?” Tan Yu asked as he walked toward the medicine vat.

There was a fragrant pot of tea being brewed alongside the medicine vat. He had personally picked the tea leaves for it, and it gave off a unique medicinal scent.

Chu Feng could see that Tan Yu was a bold but polite individual despite not being a cultivator, and that gave him a positive impression of the latter. So, he and Zi Ling sat down with him and enjoyed a cup of tea.

“Are you brewing medicine for your injury?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s an old ailment,” Tan Yu replied.

“Your medicine seems to be a painkiller, but it doesn’t seem effective,” Chu Feng pointed out.

“My ailment isn’t that easy to treat. Elder Zhao was the one who introduced me to this remedy. It’s much better than the other stuff I have tried. If not for that...” Tan Yu shook his head bitterly. “I might not have survived to this day.”

“Is that why you’re residing here?”

Chu Feng could tell that the medicine being brewed inside the medicine vat came from the nearby forest. There were many herbs inside the forest but no ferocious beasts at all, making it a suitable place for a mortal like Tan Yu to settle down.

“I owe Elder Zhao a lot. He was the one who cleared the monstrous beasts here on my behalf,” Tan Yu remarked.

“Why don’t you try my medicine instead?” Chu Feng opened his palm and gathered a powerful surge of spirit power on it.

Tan Yu’s eyes lit up. He couldn’t tell how strong Chu Feng was, but he could tell that his spirit power was formidable.

The spirit power swiftly manifested into a powerful formation. Chu Feng glanced at the flames beneath the medicine vat, and a bundle of it tore off and flew into the formation.

Boom!

It was an ordinary bundle of flames, but it suddenly roared into a raging inferno upon entering Chu Feng’s formation. If not for the formation’s restriction, the inferno could have swiftly burned down the entire forest.

Chu Feng took out a couple of herbs from his Cosmos Sack and threw them into the formation. Each of the herbs emanated a faint glow, and just the scent of them raised one’s spirit.

“Incredible!” Tan Yu remarked in awe.

He knew that ordinary world spiritists wouldn’t have such sharp control of spirit power, and the medicinal herbs Chu Feng had taken out earlier were exorbitant too.

A second later, the formation dissipated, and a hundred pills emerged from the formation and floated toward Tan Yu.

“Try one,” Chu Feng said.

“Thank you, milord.”

Tan Yu immediately swallowed a pill, knowing that Chu Feng’s pills were no ordinary pills. Moments later, his eyes widened.

“Milord, your pills are incredible! The pain that has been plaguing me for many years is gone, and I feel refreshed all over. I... I can sense the natural energies in the world again!” Tan Yu was so excited that he began tearing up.

“Who did it?” Chu Feng asked.

Tan Yu was taken aback. “Milord, you can see through my injury?”

A moment later, he shook his head as he realized how dumb that question was. How could the other party concoct a medicine to alleviate his condition if he couldn’t see through it?

“I am on close terms with one of the Tan Clan’s elders, and I promised him to take care of the Tan Clan. I dropped by here to visit the Tan Clan, but who could have thought that such a tragedy would have befallen the Tan Clan? The Tan Clan might be gone now, but I’d like to avenge them,” Chu Feng said.

He could tell that Tan Yu used to be a cultivator, but he regressed into a mortal due to his dantian being ripped from his body. His old ailment was a result of that too.

“I’m grateful for your kind sentiments, milord. However, our lineage has already been evicted from the Tan Clan and can’t be considered as Tan Clansmen anymore,” Tan Yu replied.

“If I think you are, you are,” Chu Feng replied.

Tan Yu stared at Chu Feng in a daze. He pressed his lips together, feeling moved. He had tasted the warmth and coldness of the world before. He was already thankful that a stranger as strong as Chu Feng was willing to lend him a helping hand; it was a godsend that the other party was willing to avenge him.

He realized this might be his only chance to exact vengeance, but in the end, he still shook his head. “Milord, it’s rare to find anyone as kind as you. I am grateful for your kind sentiments, but I don’t want to implicate others.

“Is it a regional powerhouse?” Chu Feng figured that the one who landed Tan Yu in his current plight was no ordinary person, or else Tan Yu wouldn’t have been so intimidated.

“Mm.” Tan Yu nodded.

“Who is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“The Sunmoon Sect.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“The Sunmoon Sect? I have never heard of them. How strong is their strongest expert?”

“Their sect master should be at seventh rank Half-God, but they have grand elders too. I’m not sure how strong they are, but rumor has it that they are near pinnacle Half-God level.”

“You were engrossed in my spirit power earlier. Didn’t you sense anything from it?”

“Sense anything?” Tan Yu was initially confused, but he quickly understood the underlying meaning behind those words, and his eyes lit up in excitement. “Milord, you can deal with pinnacle Half-God level cultivators?”

“I should be able to deal with pinnacle Half-Gods,” Chu Feng confirmed.

Tan Yu kneeled on the floor and began kowtowing hard against the ground, “Milord, please avenge me!”

“Calm down. Tell me the story first.” Chu Feng supported Tan Yu to his feet.

Through Tan Yu’s recount, Chu Feng swiftly grasped the situation.

Tan Yu’s grandfather was acquainted with Zhao Pei.

Unfortunately, Tan Yu’s grandfather committed a severe mistake that led to his family being evicted from the Tan Clan, and they ended up migrating to this realm. Zhao Pei continued to interact with Tan Yu’s grandfather, unbeknownst to the Tan Clan, so his family remained close to him.
