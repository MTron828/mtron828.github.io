Chapter 5100: Xian Miaomiao’s Master

“Who could it be?”

Chu Feng was resting in a chamber in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but there was a knit on his forehead. He was feeling uneasy.

Through the ancient teleportation formation, they discovered that their link with the Fogtree Lower Realm had been severed. That verified their deduction that something had happened to it. Something huge must have happened there even if it hadn’t been destroyed.

Not to mention, he had witnessed with his own eyes that brilliant light, that terrifying energy, and the disappearance of the Fogtree Lower Realm right after. This strongly suggested its destruction.

It didn’t make sense for a Lower Realm to be destroyed all of a sudden. It would take tremendous strength to pull that off. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He thought about everything that had happened at the Nine Souls Galaxy thus far, and he was worried that this matter had something to do with Sima Xiangtu or the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

No matter who it was, this meant that they already possessed strength that he was unable to withstand. Even his Asura World Spirit Army would be powerless against someone who had the power to completely destroy a Lower Realm.

He was worried that Sima Xiangtu would make a comeback since the latter possessed many incomprehensible aces up his sleeves. There was no way he would underestimate Sima Xiangtu since he had already seen some of them himself.

Of course, it could also be the Pill Dao Immortal Sect too.

In any case, this didn’t bode well for Chu Feng and the others. He could only pray that it was unrelated to either of them.

“This feeling is…”

All of a sudden, Chu Feng narrowed his eyes. He quickly turned his sights outward and saw a pillar of light descending from the sky and enveloping a sleeping chamber within the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. That was where Princess Xiaoxiao resided.

Realizing that something was amiss, Chu Feng quickly made his way over.

The phenomenon had also alerted the whole Nine Souls Sacred Clan as crowds of people rushed over.

“What incredible energy. I can’t enter at all.”

The crowd tried to break the light enveloping to enter the sleeping chamber but to no avail. Not even the Asura King was able to do so. The light had completely isolated the room from the rest of the world, making it impossible for Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eye to see what was happening inside.

Chu Feng and everyone else felt nervous and worried. Their expressions looked as if the apocalypse had fallen upon them.

They couldn’t be blamed for feeling that way since the Fogtree Lower Realm had just only been destroyed, and a powerful pillar of light that even the Asura King was helpless against suddenly fell upon the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. It was inevitable that they would link the two matters together.

“May I know who you are? Feel free to speak if you need something from us, but I ask you not to hurt my friend.”

Chu Feng could only clasp his fist toward the pillar of light and ask politely, but there wasn’t any response at all.

Soon, the entire Nine Souls Sacred Clan was plunged into a state of terror. Some of the more cowardly ones even started fleeing. They were afraid that the pillar of light was the same one that destroyed the Fogtree Lower Realm, and they didn’t want to be killed just like that.

However, Chu Feng, Wang Yuxian, the Godwish Grandmother, the Lady of Dao Sea, and the others had chosen to stay in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

They felt that the owner of the energy was after Chu Feng and not Princess Xiaoxiao. Clearly, Chu Feng wouldn’t be able to escape against someone as powerful as that even if he tried to flee, so they decided to accompany him instead.

Whether it spelled calamity or anything else, they were already prepared to face it together with him.

As for the others, they were just loyal to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

Weng!

The pillar of light lasted for a while before it started undergoing a transformation. Everyone present noticed it.

Chu Feng even boldly walked toward the pillar of light and placed his hand on it. To his surprise, his hand passed right through the pillar of light when no one else was able to breach it earlier on. This was likely to be a result of the pillar of light’s transformation.

So, he quickly entered the pillar of light without any hesitation.

Upon seeing that, Wang Yuxian quickly rushed over and attempted to enter the sleeping chamber too, but she found herself unable to pass through the pillar of light.

“It looks like Chu Feng is the only one able to pass through the pillar of light,” she said.

The Godwish Grandmother and the others tried it too, but they weren’t able to pass through. The transformation in the pillar of light seemed to be catered only to Chu Feng.

This made them feel even more uneasy as it verified their earlier deduction that the owner of this energy was here for Chu Feng.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng passed through the pillar of light and found that Princess Xiaoxiao’s sleeping chamber was undamaged. He could see what was happening inside through the Heaven’s Eye, and what he saw astonished him.

He saw Princess Xiaoxiao in a deep sleep on her bed. Her deep and steady breathing showed that she was safe and sound. However, what truly surprised Chu Feng was the other person inside the sleeping chamber.

Xian Miaomiao.

Xian Miaomiao had actually managed to escape from Princess Xiaoxiao’s body, and she seemed to be in a good condition.

It was impossible for Xian Miaomiao to have escaped by herself. In fact, even if Chu Feng had extracted her using his spirit power, it was likely that Xian Miaomiao would sustain a fair bit of damage in the process, such that she would suffer a period of debility.

In other words, it was highly unusual for Xian Miaomiao to be standing there unharmed.

Xian Miaomiao was probably the only one who had an answer to that question, so Chu Feng pushed the door to the sleeping chamber open and entered without hesitation.

“Chu Feng.”

Xian Miaomiao showed a sweet smile upon seeing Chu Feng and quickly ran up to him. She was delighted, but she didn’t seem to be surprised by Chu Feng’s appearance. This hinted that she knew that he would come.

“Are you fine, Miaomiao?”

As curious as Chu Feng was, the first thing he did was to grab Xian Miaomiao’s pulse to check on her condition.

“Silly Chu Feng. Can’t you see that I’m perfectly fine?” Xian Miaomiao replied with a grin.

After a quick inspection, Chu Feng could also tell that Xian Miaomiao was perfectly fine.

“Miaomiao, how did you come out from Princess Xiaoxiao’s body?” Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.

His instinct told him that Xian Miaomiao was likely to have the answer to that question.

“My master helped me escape. He told me everything that has happened while I was asleep. Chu Feng, you’re incredible. You saved all of us back at the Ancestral Lower Realm, and you were able to do the same here at the Nine Souls Galaxy too,” Xian Miaomiao complimented with a heartened smile.

However, Chu Feng was confused by her response.

“Who is your master?” Chu Feng asked.

“To be honest with you, I have no idea who he is either,” Xian Miaomiao scratched her head as she answered merrily.

“You don’t know?”

Chu Feng was baffled to hear that.

“Yeah. I mean, I just met him and I decided to take him as my master on the spot,” Xian Miaomiao replied.

“Elder, are you willing to meet me?” Chu Feng asked with a clasped fist.

He knew that Xian Miaomiao’s master was the person who enveloped this place with the pillar of light. Since the pillar of light was still around, her master should be in the vicinity. Furthermore, the fact that her master was willing to take in Xian Miaomiao as his disciple and recount everything that had happened during this period of time suggested that he wasn’t an enemy.

“Don’t bother, Chu Feng. My master wouldn’t have tasked me to pass on a message to you if he wished to meet you,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Pass on a message to me? Miaomiao, your master has something to say to me?” Chu Feng asked.

“To be exact, it’s your master who has something to say to you.”

Xian Miaomiao took out a letter. It was the one which the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had handed over to the middle-aged man carrying an ax.
