Chapter 5675: Information From the Imprint

“Lord Kui Ting, how far away are you from True God level?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m still some distance away, but it’s not that far anymore,” the Asura King replied.

“Try consuming this,” Chu Feng said as he transferred the origin energies he had accumulated into the World Spirit Space.

He intended to leave them to Eggy and Yu Sha, but Yu Sha wasn’t awake yet and it was uncertain when Eggy would recover. Rather than hold onto it, he thought it could be put to better use by giving it to the Asura King.

The Asura King would be another trump card if he could make a breakthrough to True God level.

“Lord Chu Feng, this…”

The Asura King was hesitant to accept the origin energies, as he could tell that some of them belonged to True God level cultivators. It was simply too valuable. It was just moments ago that he reached pinnacle Half-God level with Chu Feng’s help, and the latter was giving him something so precious now. He felt embarrassed.

“Your strength will benefit me,” Chu Feng said.

“I understand.” The Asura King finally took the origin energies, though he quickly added, “Lord Chu Feng, please don’t address us lords anymore. We are your subjects.”

“There’s no need for such formalities. We should call each other however we want to. How do you feel about the origin energies?” Chu Feng asked.

“The origin energies are too strong. I’ll need time to assimilate it and draw out its power,” the Asura King said.

“Take your time to assimilate it, Lord Kui Ting. There’s no rush,” Chu Feng said before taking his leave.

The Asura World Spirit Army quickly crowded around the Asura King and said, “Milord, it hasn’t been long since we were sealed inside the gate, but Lord Chu Feng has made huge progress in his cultivation. That’s even faster than the Heavenly King of Massacre!” Xiangji said.

“Based on what I know, the Heavenly King of Massacre didn’t reach Lord Chu Feng’s strength at his age. It’s possible that Lord Chu Feng might tower above the Heavenly King of Massacre in the future,” the Asura King said.

The Asura World Spirit Army was excited to hear that.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They wouldn’t have believed such words in the past, but now they did.

…

Chu Feng’s consciousness returned to his body. He didn’t bother dwelling too much on the Asura Sword, knowing that it was futile to think too much about it when he couldn’t use it.

While the Asura World Spirit Army was his strongest force at the moment, he couldn’t carelessly use it due to the restrictions imposed by the gate. He would still have to count on himself, and for that, he needed to raise his cultivation.

The Immemorial Meditation Method tempered his psyche, and it would benefit his world spiritist techniques in the long run.

…

A floating warship appeared around the temporary palaces where Chu Feng and the other challengers of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s entrance examination resided.

This warship was copper in color. It was neither huge nor extravagant, but its craftsmanship was exquisite. It flew the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s flag, but it was actually a treasure from the Ancient Era.

There were no guards in the warship, but two Saint-tier elders were kneeling on the deck before a small palace. They were Jie Qinghe and Jie Zhenfu. They were here to report what Chu Feng and Fu Xing had encountered in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.

“You may take your leave,” the voice of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master echoed from the small palace.

However, Jie Qinghe didn’t leave right away but instead asked, “Lord Mansion Master, what should we do in the subsequent test?”

Shoosh!

A scroll flew forth from the palace.

Jie Qinghe caught it, and the two elders looked at it together. It contained the details about the subsequent trial. The two elders were delighted by the decision. They quickly bowed and took their leave.

Inside the palace, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master sat at the main seat at the very end of the palace with a sphere containing seven-colored fluids. He had obtained the sphere from the crack of God’s Era.

“Chu Feng has surprised me yet again. I didn’t expect him to achieve so much on his first trip in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. The prophecy of God’s Era might come true. Chu Feng, let’s see if you can rid me of the thorn in my side, as prophesied,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said with a hint of anticipation in his eyes.

…

In accordance with the rules, those who had achieved the top ten results in the practical exam would be allowed to enter the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but Chu Feng had protected so many people in the trial that many thought that the results were rigged.

Thus, all candidates aside from Chu Feng and Fu Xing had to undergo another test, and the test would be held in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s headquarters.

However, there was a piece of good news—the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would be taking in a hundred people instead of the original ten.

The candidates were excited to learn that they got to enter the holy land of world spiritists, as well as the fact that they had a better chance of joining the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion now.

At the same time, they also knew that they had no chance to claim the first place anymore. That would be between Chu Feng and Fu Xing, with Chu Feng standing a higher chance.

Along the way, Chu Feng continued to practice the Immemorial Meditation Method. It was only when the warship flew out of the teleportation passageway that he finally left his chambers.

They had arrived at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s headquarters.

The area outside was shrouded in a sea of clouds, but unlike those in the sky, these clouds were thick and billowed more often, looking more like the sea instead.

Soon, they stumbled upon a massive barrier enveloping the area. They entered through the entrance gate, and a beautiful world unfolded before their eyes. It was not extravagant, but it looked grand. It was meticulously designed, and any world spiritist would have been awed by it.

Chu Feng’s eyes suddenly narrowed as he glanced at his palm. It was the palm where the World Spiritist Immortal King had left an imprint on. He closed his eyes and focused on the imprint. Moments later, a smile formed on his lips.

“I see.”

It was a piece of information that greatly boosted his confidence in his journey to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.
