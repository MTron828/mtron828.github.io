Chapter 4589: Public Execution

“Master?”

That single word plunged every single person of the Holy Light Clan into nervousness. They glanced at one another uneasily, fearing for what that was to come.

Both the Double-eyed Daoist and the Cannibal Monk were capable individuals, and they were known for being extremely conceited too. A person who was worthy of becoming their master had to be an exceptional existence too.

“Who is your master?” Shengguang Yunyue asked grimly.

“Our master is someone whom you can’t afford to offend! If you wish to live, release Chu Feng right now. Otherwise, every single one of you from the Holy Light Clan will be meeting your end here!” the Cannibal Monk declared.

“Brazen knaves! I would like to see who will be the ones meeting their end here!” Shengguang Xuanye sneered.

He released a powerful aura that trembled the sky and earth. Even though it didn’t cause any destruction, it made everyone shudder in fear. The cowardly even fainted right on the spot.

This was a power comparable to the deities. It felt as if everyone’s lives were governed in his hands. As long as he willed so, he could take all of them down to hell right away.

This was the prowess of the strongest expert of the Holy Light Galaxy, the Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief, Shengguang Xuanye!

“The Holy Light Clan sure knows how to put on airs! What a pity that you can only flaunt your power in this small Holy Light Galaxy!”

Just as everyone was feeling too frightened to speak, a voice suddenly sounded in the air.

Gazing over, more than a dozen figures were currently flitting their way over from the horizon. There were giants standing over a hundred meters tall, as well as black flood dragons that spanned over ten thousand meters in length.

Of course, there were also human cultivators within the group too, but these cultivators had a feral look on their faces that made it clear that they weren’t to be trifled with.

The appearance of these people sparked a huge discussion amongst the crowd.

There were some faces amongst them that the crowd knew of. All of them were villains from the NIne Souls Galaxy, and some of them were even more notorious than the Cannibal Monk.

However, amongst this group of villains, there was a voice that sounded particularly out of place. It was from a young lady dressed in a green dress. She was as beautiful as a fairy, and her skin was so delicate that it was glowing under the sun.

Without a doubt, she didn’t fit in with the vicious tyrants standing around her. Yet, she was sitting atop the black flood dragon, making no one dare to underestimate her. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

And she was also the one who spoke earlier.

“Paying respects to master!”

The Double-eyed Daoist and Cannibal Monk walked over to the young lady and bowed deeply to her.

“She’s their master?”

Everyone staggered in shock.

They had thought of many possibilities of how the master of the Double-eyed Daoist and Cannibal Monk looked like, but none of them came close to the young lady standing before them.

If Chu Feng was here, he would have surely recognized this young lady.

She was Song Yun, a person whom he coincidentally met when he visited the Conquerstar Mountain Villa to save Su Rou and Su Mei.

But even Chu Feng would have been shocked to see Song Yun here. He would have never thought that Song Yun would actually come here to save him, let alone the fact that she was actually the master of this group of villains.

“This miss over there, may I know where you are from?” a voice sounded from the Holy Light Clan.

It was still Shengguang Yunyue.

Despite being a Supreme Elder of the Holy Light Clan, she had taken on a polite tone when conversing with Song Yun. She knew that the young lady was definitely someone with quite the background, given that so many villains had come under her command.

She was not frightened of this young lady, but she was frightened of the background that this young lady had.

“Shut your mouth. The likes of you dare to speak actually dare to speak to me. Know your place!”

Song Yun shot down Shengguang Yunyue without any mercy before turning to face the Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Say, old man. You sure are brazen to dare to touch my big brother Chu Feng. Are you really anxious to see your Holy Light Clan disappear from the face of the world?”

Those words shocked the crowd. They never thought that the young lady would so haughty as to look down on Shengguang Yunyue and Shengguang Xuanye. Realizing that the young lady standing before them could be far greater than what they had initially thought, they began to re-evaluate her.

And what was even more shocking was that someone with such great background actually addressed Chu Feng intimately as ‘big brother’. This left the crowd wondering just how the two of them were related to one another.

Hushed mutters could be vaguely heard amongst the crowd as they tried to make sense of the situation.

“Interesting. How interesting!”

Instead of flying into a rage, Shengguang Xuanye began laughing heartily, making it hard to guess just what he was thinking.

“Supreme Elder Yunyue, bring Chu Feng over!” Shengguang Xuanye instructed.

Shengguang Yunyue immediately headed back into the camp to bring Chu Feng out.

Seeing this situation, the crowd couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy and conflicted.

Was the Holy Light Clan’s Clan Chief really intending to release Chu Feng?

They did disagree with the Holy Light Clan’s decision to eliminate Chu Feng because they thought of the latter as a risk to their rule, but ultimately, the Holy Light Clan was still the representative power of the Holy Light Galaxy, and these villains were from the Nine Souls Galaxy.

If the Holy Light Clan were to bow down here, it would be a huge embarrassment to the Holy Light Galaxy.

Soon, Shengguang Yunyue returned with Chu Feng behind her. She had healed Chu Feng’s wounds by a little and placed some disguise on him, making the latter look more seemly.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng’s weakened state still made everyone realize that he had been through quite a bit during the time he was in the Holy Light Clan’s camp.

“You scoundrels! What did you do to my big brother Chu Feng?!”

Seeing how weak he was, fury surfaced in Song Yun’s eyes.

“Y-you! Why are you here?”

As expected, Chu Feng was astonished to see Song Yun here.

However, Shengguang Xuanye interjected before Song Yun could say anything.

“Chu Feng, are you still going to feign ignorance? They are obviously your companions! Seeing just what kind of people you associate yourselves with, it’s no wonder why you would commit such atrocities and repay our kindness with ingratitude!

“I was still thinking of giving you a chance in view that you’re still a talent of our Holy Light Galaxy, but it seems like we can’t afford to spare you anymore!”

Shengguang Xuanye sneered at Chu Feng before turning his gaze to Song Yun.

“Unorthodox powers like you dare to step onto the land of our Holy Light Clan and demand the release of your people? You claimed that you’ll decimate our Holy Light Clan if we refuse to release Chu Feng?

“Very well, I shall take Chu Feng’s life right before your eyes then! Let’s see how you’ll decimate our Holy Light Clan! Men, execute Chu Feng!”

Everyone widened their eyes in astonishment upon hearing Shengguang Xuanye’s words.

Shengguang Xuanye wasn’t planning on releasing Chu Feng but to execute him before everyone’s eyes!

As soon as Shengguang Xuanye said those words, the elders of the Holy Light Clan immediately pinned Chu Feng up in midair. The elder of the Punishment Hall raised his saber up high and readied himself to behead Chu Feng.

“Hold it right there!!!”

A roar suddenly sounded in the distance.

Everyone turned their gazes over, and what they saw shook their hearts. Putting aside the crowd, even the Holy Light Clan couldn’t retain their composure anymore.

Humongous war chariots were whizzing across the sky, heading straight toward the Holy Light Clan’s camp. Huge flags were fluttering above the war chariots.

And it was these flags that shocked everyone gathered in this area.

It was the Nine Souls Sacred Clan!
