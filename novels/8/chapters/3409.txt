Chapter 3409 - Linghu Yuhua

“Sure enough, the treasures of this grand formation are not that easily obtainable.”

“As matters stand, it seems that I have no choice but to remove the suppression of the grand formation.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Seeing that the situation had gone amiss, Grandmaster Liangqiu sighed and made a decision.

He was planning to remove the suppression of the grand formation and personally enter it to save Chu Feng and the others.

“Grandmaster Liangqiu, please don’t be so anxious just yet. Perhaps the situation is not as bad as you imagine it to be.”

Right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded from behind Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Turning around, a figure slowly walked toward Grandmaster Liangqiu.

It was an aged old lady. Although very sparse, she had a head of snow-white hair.

Her face was covered in wrinkles. She was extremely old, so old that her back was hunched. Age had left very heavy traces on her face, so much so that it was already impossible for one to determine how she had looked in her youth, whether beautiful or ugly.

From her current appearance, she was extremely ugly, even frighteningly so, due to how aged she looked.

However, that old lady emitted an extraordinary air.

That sort of extraordinary air was definitely impossible to possess unless one possessed a powerful cultivation and had experienced corresponding trials and tribulations.

That old lady was naturally not an ordinary individual. She was one of the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s eight Supreme Elders, Linghu Yuhua.

Like Grandmaster Liangqiu, Linghu Yuhua was also an Utmost Exalted-level expert. She was one of the strongest existences in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Upon seeing Linghu Yuehua, Grandmaster Liangqiu did not reveal any surprise at all.

A genius of Linghu Hongfei’s caliber was the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s future. The Linghu Heavenly Clan wouldn’t possibly allow him to travel outside on his own. He was most definitely protected by a top expert.

As for Linghu Yuhua, she was the top expert that was secretly protecting him.

“Here, see with this,” as Linghu Yuhua spoke, she took out a copper mirror from her sleeve.

Through that copper mirror, Grandmaster Liangqiu was actually able to see the current situation of Chu Feng and the others.

The copper mirror was focused on Linghu Hongfei. Thus, its range was limited. Fortunately, Chu Feng was within its range.

At that moment, black gaseous flames had surrounded Chu Feng and the others.

Both Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei had unleashed their respective spirit power to resist the black gaseous flames that were surrounding them.

“Sure enough, Linghu Hongfei is already a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist,” as Linghu Hongfei had released his spirit power inside the spirit formation, Grandmaster Liangqiu finally learned his current level in terms of world spirit techniques.

Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, that was Linghu Hongfei’s current level.

However, upon seeing such power from Linghu Hongfei, not only did Grandmaster Liangqiu not have an expression of surprise or joy, he instead felt deep regret.

“Linghu Hongfei is only a fine line away from becoming a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Are you all really planning to do this?”

“If you all are to succeed this time, he will really have no way to turn things around,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said to Linghu Yuhua.

“That is his own decision. We can only choose to respect it,” Linghu Yuhua said.

“So that’s the case,” Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke no more. Instead, he began to focus on the copper mirror with a serious expression.

Even though the black gaseous flames were being held back by Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei’s spirit power, Grandmaster Liangqiu could tell just by looking at them that the black gaseous flames were very remarkable.

The black gaseous flames were fatal!!!

Originally, the people inside the spirit formation all felt extremely afraid upon seeing such frightening flames. The reason for that was because the black gaseous flames were so powerful that they simply could not resist them with their martial power.

Fortunately, Linghu Hongfei and Chu Feng had joined hands, and managed to successfully resist the black gaseous flames.

“Young master Linghu, never would I have imagined that you were already a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist. It would appear that you must be the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist that Exalted Heavenly Fate prophesied.”

“Fortunately, you’re here with us, otherwise, we would’ve likely ended up suffering this time around.”

The two Tantai Heavenly Clan’s younger generations began to praise Linghu Hongfei with expressions of adoration on their faces.

“Chu Feng, you must be having great difficulty persisting, right? If you can’t continue, just go ahead and say it. My big brother Hongfei will not leave you behind,” Linghu Lun mocked Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because compared to Linghu Hongfei, who had managed to push the black gaseous flames further and further away, the black gaseous flames around Chu Feng were growing closer and closer to him.

A clear-cut contrast had been formed between the two.

“Unable to persist? Which eye of yours saw that I was unable to persist?”

Chu Feng cast a glance at Linghu Lun like he was looking at a fool.

Although the black gaseous flames were getting closer to him, Chu Feng had a very relaxed expression. He did not appear like someone who was facing an imminent catastrophe at all.

“You’re still refusing to admit it? Very well, I shall see how much longer you can continue,” Linghu Lun gnashed his teeth furiously. He had never met someone as thick-skinned at Chu Feng before.

No matter what sort of situation he was in, Chu Feng always remained composed and indifferent. Furthermore, he would leave Linghu Lun speechless every single time.

Faced with such a Chu Feng, Linghu Lun felt truly helpless.His humiliating insults were completely ineffective. Instead, Chu Feng’s retort ended up making him more and more furious.

“Chu Feng, no one will care if something is to happen to you. However, if something is to happen to our young miss, I will not let you get away with it!” One of the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s younger generations actually threatened Chu Feng.

“Shut up! Don’t be rude towards young master Chu Feng!” Tantai Xing’er actually berated that person with a furious look on her face.

The sudden rebuke from Tantai Xing’er not only shocked the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, but it also shocked the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

Although Tantai Xing’er was the number one genius of the Tantai Heavenly Clan, she was a very good-natured person, and was famous for her good temperament. Very rarely did she ever get angry with anyone.

For her to act like that, it meant that she was really angered.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. Things will clear up eventually, and the truth will soon be revealed. It’s normal for them to not understand. However, they would eventually come to understand,” faced with Linghu Lun’s insults and that Tantai Heavenly Clansman’s threat, Chu Feng had a beaming smile on his face. It was as if he did not place them in his heart at all.

“Brother Chu Feng, don’t worry. Once I finish pushing away the black flames in the surroundings, I will go and help you,” Linghu Hongfei said.

“Brother Linghu, there’s really no need for it. You must not help me. Otherwise, it will ruin my plan,” Chu Feng said.

“You are truly one that’s unable to appreciate another’s kind intentions. Brother Hongfei, don’t bother with him. Let him seek his own destruction,” Linghu Yueyue spoke angrily.

Linghu Yueyue was also enraged by Chu Feng. How could there be a person like Chu Feng? He was on the verge of failure, yet not only did he refuse another’s help, but he even said that they would ruin his plan?

“That’s right. If he wants to die, let him die,” the other geniuses from the Linghu Heavenly Clan added.

They were truly enraged by Chu Feng.

Linghu Hongfei had said that he would help, yet Chu Feng actually refused him. His action was truly that of someone who was incapable of differentiating good from bad.

However, compared to the other Linghu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, Linghu Hongfei suddenly noticed the transformation that was occurring between Chu Feng’s spirit formation and the black gaseous flames. The black gaseous flames were not only approaching Chu Feng. Instead, a transformation had occurred to the black gaseous flames. Furthermore, it seemed that the black gaseous flames were fusing with Chu Feng’s spirit formation!!!

Seeing that, Linghu Hongfei hurriedly asked Chu Feng, “Brother Chu Feng, could it be that you’ve discovered something?”

“It would appear that brother Linghu has noticed it. Sure enough... you are the only intelligent person in your Linghu Heavenly Clan,” Chu Feng took a mocking glance at Linghu Yueyue and the others as he said those words.
