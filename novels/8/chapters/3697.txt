Chapter 3697 - A Sight Of Grievance

“Senior, what’s wrong?” Chu Feng knew that something major had happened upon hearing Chu Xuanzhengfa’s voice.

Sure enough, something major did happen.

It turned out that it was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and his condition.

Not even Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng, the two Saint-cloak World Spiritists, were able to stabilize his condition.

They needed Chu Feng’s assistance.

As the matter concerned the life and death of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Feng did not dare to hesitate, and immediately rushed over to where the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was being treated.

Once he entered, Grandmaster Liangqiu immediately set up a spirit formation.

After setting up the spirit formation, Grandmaster Liangqiu ordered that even if the heavens were to collapse, no one was to disturb them. Otherwise, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would end up dying.

After hearing what Grandmaster Liangqiu said, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others realized how serious their Lord Clan Chief’s condition was.

However, there was nothing they could do. After all, they were unable to help in the matter.

They could only place their hopes on Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Chengfeng, and Chu Feng.

Thus, apart from complying with Grandmaster Liangqiu and sealing that place, there was nothing they could do.

“It would appear that Lord Clan Chief’s situation is extremely bad.” Chu Lingxi also had a serious look on her face.

She had grown up in the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was like a grandfather to her. She was very close to him.

As such, she would naturally not hope for anything to happen to him.

“Lord Clan Chief is worthy of heaven’s help. He should be fine.” Chu Xuanzhengfa comforted her.

“Milord, the situation is bad!”

Right at that moment, an expert from the Law Enforcement Hall rushed in in a panic.

At that moment, nervousness filled his face. He had the look of someone facing impending doom.

“What happened?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“It’s the Linghu Heavenly Clan,” replied that expert.

“Linghu Heavenly Clan?” Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Lingxi’s expressions changed upon hearing those words.

“Linghu Hongfei has arrived with the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s experts. They mentioned Chu Feng by name and demanded to challenge him," said that expert.

“Challenge Chu Feng?” Chu Xuanzhengfa frowned upon hearing those words.

What was the Linghu Heavenly Clan? They were an existence currently engaged in a battle against the Starfield Master Realm for the spot of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord position.

It would not be excessive to say that they were the strongest power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

And now, such a power had come to cause trouble. How exactly was he supposed to handle them?

Even if Gu Mingyuan was present, she would likely not be able to hold them off either.

“They came this quickly?”

Compared to Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Lingxi reacted as if she had anticipated it.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Lingxi’s body shifted. She headed outside the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Lingxi, what are you doing?” asked Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Father, they’ve come to challenge us. How can we cower before them?”

“Since Chu Feng is unable to accept the challenge, I will take on this so-called number one genius Linghu Hongfei on his behalf.”

As Chu Lingxi spoke, her figure disappeared. Only her voice still resonated in the sky.

Even though her voice was filled with confidence, Chu Xuanzhengfa was still extremely worried for her. Thus, his body shifted, and he rushed after her.

......

After Chu Feng entered the palace hall used for the treatment of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he gave his all to cooperate with Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Once they began, they continued the treatment for three entire days.

After three days passed, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s condition had finally stabilized.

Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was still unconscious and needed to be slowly nursed back to health, he was at least no longer in fatal danger.

“Seniors, this kindness is not something that I can thank you enough for. But, I must still thank seniors for this kindness.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng bowed to Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng.

Chu Feng knew very well that it could be said that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was only able to live because Grandmaster Liangqiu had forcibly pulled him back from the gates of the afterlife.

What he had done was truly a grace of saving one’s life.

Grandmaster Liangqiu sighed, then said, “Young friend Chu Feng, this is only something that this old man should do. Based on our relationship, I cannot disregard your clan chief’s life and death.”

“Besides, you yourself have helped enormously in the treatment. If you weren’t here, your clan chief would not have been able to survive.”

“Chu Feng, what my master said is correct. In terms of contribution, your contributions cannot go unnoticed,” Liangqiu Chengfeng added.

Facing those two people, Chu Feng felt endlessly moved. He could only say, “Chu Feng will definitely repay seniors’ kindness and grace.”

“Chu Feng, it’s enough. Your clansmen must be worried about your clan chief. You should go out and report this good news to them,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Chu Feng immediately got up upon hearing those words.

Grandmaster Liangqiu waved his sleeve and removed the spirit formation that covered the palace hall.

When the spirit formation disappeared, Chu Feng discovered Chu Xuanzhengfa was standing outside the gate.

Chu Xuanzhengfa had entered the palace. Merely, he did not dare to disturb Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Chengfeng and Chu Feng. That was why he was standing outside the spirit formation.

However, Chu Xuanzhengfa had an extremely pale look on his face. Worry was written all over his visibly pale face.

“Chu Feng, how is Lord Clan Chief?” Chu Xuanzhengfa stepped forth and asked. His voice was filled with nervousness.

This was the first time Chu Feng had seen Chu Xuanzhengfa like that.

“Senior, Lord Clan Chief has escaped danger. He will be able to recover with time,” said Chu Feng.

“Putt~~~”

Right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa suddenly knelt on the ground.

He began to kowtow to Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng.

Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng were bewildered by Chu Xuanzhengfa’s actions. Confused, they turned their gazes to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had originally thought that Chu Xuanzhengfa was acting this way because he wanted to thank Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng for saving their Lord Clan Chief.

However, after Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke, Chu Feng realized that the situation was amiss.

“Milords, you two have saved my Lord Clan Chief. You’ve already shown us enormous grace.”

“Originally, I shouldn’t trouble you two at a time like this.”

“However, my daughter is seriously injured. I truly have no choice but to seek seniors’ help in saving my daughter.”

Not only was Chu Xuanzhengfa kowtowing nonstop, he was even weeping bitter tears as he said those words. He seemed like he was about to collapse.

“Senior, what happened to Lingxi?”

After learning that something had happened to Chu Lingxi, Chu Feng’s expression changed greatly. He immediately stepped forth to ask what had happened.

However, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not respond. He continued to kowtow to Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng, begging them to treat Chu Lingxi.

“Quickly bring your daughter here,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Chu Feng had already rushed out by the time Grandmaster Liangqiu said those words.

However, when he arrived outside the entrance gate, Chu Feng stood stunned.

Chu Hanpeng and the other experts from the Chu Heavenly Clan were all present.

Chu Lingxi was also present.

Merely, Chu Lingxi’s condition was extremely bad.

Not only was she covered in blood and deathly pale, but her aura was also extremely weak. It was so weak that it was on the verge of disappearing.

However, what was most shocking of all were her eyes.

Originally, Chu Lingxi had a pair of extremely spirited eyes. They were like two galaxies, and could be said to be the most charming aspect to her.

However, her eyes were now completely bloodied.

The places that were originally bright and spirited were completely empty.

Chu Lingxi’s eyes were gone.

Someone had forcibly dug out her eyes!!!

Although Chu Feng still didn’t understand what had happened, he felt his brain going numb and his head going blank upon seeing such a thing.

He felt like there were millions and millions of swords skewering his heart. The pain was simply unbearable. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Seeing such a seriously injured Chu Lingxi. Chu Feng felt so much pain that he felt like he was on the verge of death.
