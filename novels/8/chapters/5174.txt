Chapter 5174: Trash Who Only Acts Smugly Before Their Own People

Due to Chu Feng’s sensitive identity, they had to keep this matter confidential even from the others in the World Spiritist Technique Sect. The only ones aware of this matter were Yue Ling and her master.

To be safe, Yue Ling’s master even chose to meet Chu Feng outside the sect.

Courtesy was necessary since this was their first meeting. So, Chu Feng didn’t conceal himself and openly walked up to Yue Ling’s master.

Yue Ling’s master was extremely nervous. He knew that Chu Feng was someone who had no qualms killing those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. If not for the fact that they were pushed to a corner, he wouldn’t have wanted to have anything to do with Chu Feng.

“I am the First Elder of the Nameless Sect, Fang Tong. Paying respects to milord.”

Yue Ling first bowed to Chu Feng before reporting his own identity. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Elder Fang, it’s fate that I met with Yue Ling. We might not have known each other for a long time, but I view her as a friend. I’m willing to go to all lengths for my friends, so you don’t have to be this courteous with me. It’s only right for me to do this. I only hope that my identity won’t cause your sect any trouble afterward,” Chu Feng said.

“Milord, please don’t say that. It’s already a blessing to our Nameless Sect that you’re willing to offer us your help,” Yue Ling’s master said.

It would seem like he really didn’t mind Chu Feng’s identity and was earnestly grateful for his help.

The three of them quickly set off afterward.

Despite Chu Feng’s amicable attitude, Yue Ling’s master remained fearful of Chu Feng. He didn’t speak a single word unless Chu Feng took the initiative to speak. It made him look rather restrained.

In contrast, Yue Ling chatted with Chu Feng via voice transmission for the entire journey.

“Benefactor, why can’t you disguise yourself when you are able to conceal yourself? Is there a huge difference between the two?” Yue Ling asked out of curiosity.

“Strictly speaking, there isn’t really much of a difference between the two. To be frank with you, I don’t really know whether concealing myself is considered to be a breach of the rules. I hope not.”

In truth, Chu Feng had only seen the warning left behind by the mysterious person over at Zhao Hong’s place. He tried his best to follow the mysterious person’s demands, but there were times when he was forced to disguise and conceal himself.

He didn’t think that the mysterious person would be so bored to spy on his every move, but he still chose to follow the mysterious person’s orders despite the great inconvenience. He couldn’t bear the thought of anything happening to Zhao Hong.

That was simply how Chu Feng was like. He wasn’t afraid of trouble, but he didn’t want to implicate those around him.

Taking this matter for example, he had so many reservations even though he was the one helping the Nameless Sect. It was all because he was worried about Yue Ling and the others.

The ancient remnant was located in the same realm, so it didn’t take them long to arrive at their destination. It was sealed off by a barrier, but Yue Ling’s master had the corresponding spirit formation key and was able to easily pass through it.

By then, Chu Feng had already concealed himself.

As the barrier opened up, Chu Feng suddenly sensed a few people approaching them. He quickly turned his head over and saw three white-haired elders.

The two standing behind were dressed in world spiritist robes. From the spirit power pulsating from their robes, Chu Feng could tell that they were at rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation. They had incredibly smug looks on their faces.

The last one was an elder dressed in the robes of the World Spiritist Technique Sect.

“Yue Ling, look in your southwest. Is that your sectmaster?” Chu Feng asked Yue Ling.

Yue Ling didn’t notice the trio. It was only at Chu Feng’s words that she turned over, but the limits of her vision disallowed her from seeing anything. It took a while before the three elders finally appeared in her line of sight.

“Benefactor, that’s indeed our sectmaster. Master, look! That’s Lord Sectmaster! He has made it in time! It seems like he has managed to find people to help us.”

Yue Ling was excited to learn that it was indeed their sectmaster.

“It really is Lord Sectmaster. Our Nameless Sect is saved!”

Yue Ling’s master was overjoyed too.

Before their sectmaster landed on the ground, the two of them quickly bowed deeply to greet him.

“Yue Ling, Elder Fang. Hurry and pay respects to the two masters here. With their help, the Nine Levels Pavilion need not dream of stepping into this ancient remnant ever again,” the World Spiritist Techniques Sect’s sectmaster said.

He seemed to have a high opinion of the two elders he had brought here.

Yue Ling and her master quickly bowed and greeted the two rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists. Despite their respectful attitude, the two so-called masters maintained their arrogant attitude.

“Sectmaster, my master and I have also invited a master to help us out. With the help of so many masters, we’ll definitely be able to defeat the Nine Levels Pavilion!” Yue Ling said.

“Oh? You have invited another master here? Who is it?” the World Spiritist Techniques Sect’s sectmaster asked.

Before Yue Ling and her master could answer, the two masters had already revealed looks of displeasure.

“Nameless Sect’s sectmaster, what do you mean by this? Why did you invite someone else after asking us brothers for help? You can just say so if you don’t trust us. There’s no need to beat around the bush,” one of the two elders harrumphed.

“Masters, I am unaware of this matter.”

The World Spiritist Techniques Sect’s sectmaster quickly turned to Yue Ling’s master and asked, “Fang Tong, what’s going on? I didn’t tell you to look for a helper, so why did you do something extraneous? Do you not trust me?”

His voice was filled with anger and reproach.

Chu Feng frowned at that sight.

Anyone with common sense could tell that Yue Ling’s master was doing this for the sect’s sake, and all the World Spiritist Techniques Sect’s sectmaster had to do was to clear up the misunderstanding. Yet, he actually started berating Yue Ling’s master.

Putting that in contrast to how meek he was before the two masters, it made him look like trash who only knew how to talk big before his own people. It was no wonder why the World Spiritist Techniques Clan fell into decline.
