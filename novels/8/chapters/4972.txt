Chapter 4972: The Monstrous King’s Soul Mound

The person standing on the city walls was skinny and short, standing at around a meter tall. She wore a veil that made it impossible to make out her facial features, but there were strands of white hair peeking out of her veil.&nbsp;Her hand was filled with wrinkles and age spots.&nbsp;

All of these were evidence of her age.

It felt like a strong wind could easily topple her from the city wall.

However, Chu Feng knew that she was actually a junior. Her appearance was feigned. She was the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple.&nbsp;

But why would the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple be here?”

“Elder, what are you doing here?” Chu Feng couldn’t help but ask. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Despite knowing that the other party was a junior, he still felt respect for the latter due to the experiences at the Godwish Grandmother’s trial. Due to that, he habitually addressed her as ‘elder’.

“Why can’t I be here?”

The Godwish Grandmother’s disciple put on a cold attitude as if she didn’t know Chu Feng at all. However, Chu Feng wasn’t surprised by that since he knew that she was a cold person, not to mention that she harbored misunderstandings toward him.

“Chu Feng, you know Senior Song?” Song Feifei asked in surprise.

She didn’t expect that Chu Feng would be acquainted with the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He couldn’t help but remember the past upon seeing the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple.

Those were recent affairs, but Chu Feng had been through so much that it felt like a long time had passed since then. However, he soon thought of something and turned to look at Song Feifei.

“Does this mean that the Godwish Grandmother is acquainted with the Lady of Dao Sea?”

“The Godwish Grandmother is our martial aunt, but we only learned about this recently,” Song Feifei replied with a smile.&nbsp;

From her expression, it could be seen that she was overjoyed to know that the Godwish Grandmother was her martial aunt. After all, the Godwish Grandmother was a renowned figure in the Nine Souls Galaxy, just like the Lady of Dao Sea.

It was good news that they had another strong backing.

“What a surprise.”

Chu Feng hadn’t expected the Godwish Grandmother to have such ties with the Lady of Dao Sea.

“This means that the Godwish Grandmother is here too?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, our martial aunt is here too,” Song Feifei replied with a nod.

Chu Feng was delighted to hear that.

He was unable to do anything about Long Xiaoxiao’s disfigurement, but the Godwish Grandmother might just be able to treat her. After all, she was the one who treated him back then.&nbsp;

He didn’t want to miss this opportunity to treat Long Xiaoxiao. Even if the Godwish Grandmother was unwilling to help him, it would be good if he could obtain the treatment method from her.

“Elder, I’m glad you’re here. That man is from unknown origins, but he intends to barge into the city! I believe that we should apprehend him right away in case he attempts something,” Senior Qiu spoke up.&nbsp;

From his attitude, it could be seen that he carried a fair bit of respect for the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple. It was just that Chu Feng didn’t expect him to spout such blatant lies right away.

“Do I look blind to you? I can at least tell as much that he hasn’t attempted to barge into the city. You’re obviously the one making things hard for him,” the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple replied.

“I…”

Senior Qiu didn’t expect the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple to have seen everything, and it put him in an awkward position.

“Elder, I’m doing this to ensure the success of our operation,” Senior Qiu argued.

“Haven’t you learned manners? You might be guests, but you should get it in your mind who the master of this place is,” the Godwish Grandmother spoke with a sharp tone.

“Hmph!””

Senior Qiu was displeased at the Godwish Grandmother’s attitude, such that he flung his sleeves and marched back into the city. The others left together with him.

“Song Feifei, you settle Chu Feng down,” the Godwish Grandmother’s disciple said before leaving the area.

She didn’t even spare Chu Feng a glance when she left, but Chu Feng could tell that she had only appeared to free him from the quandary he was in. Thus, he felt grateful to her.&nbsp;

Following that, Chu Feng was brought into the city by Song Feifei and settled into a palace. Since he was free, he decided to explore the area.&nbsp;

Song Feifei trusted Chu Feng deeply, to the point that she honestly answered any question he asked. Soon, Chu Feng got a rough understanding of the situation.

The good news was that the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea weren’t here for the ancient remnant Shengguang Baimei spoke about. Just as he had suspected, they had uncovered another ancient remnant.&nbsp;

However, this ancient remnant wasn’t pre-Ancient Era but post-Ancient Era, and it went by the name of ‘Monstrous King’s Soul Mound’.

Tens of thousands of years ago, a Monstrous King rose from the Nine Souls Galaxy. He was extremely powerful, such that even the Nine Souls Sacred Clan feared him. It was just that the Monstrous King was unfortunate to have been afflicted with a lethal disease.&nbsp;

He was unwilling to die just like that, so he searched around the world and eventually found this fortuitous land. He set up a formation on this land and sealed his soul in it, hoping that he could one day be born anew through the nourishment of the formation.&nbsp;

He eventually failed.

While he lost his life, his soul energy continued to linger in the land. Due to the refinement by the formation, it became a cultivation resource that could be assimilated by any cultivator.

The Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea had come here in hopes of acquiring the Monstrous King’s soul energy.&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the Monstrous King knew that it would take time for him to come back to life when he sealed his soul here, so he was worried that his enemies might do him harm during this period of time. Thus, he spent a great deal of effort setting up defensive mechanisms inside his soul mound.&nbsp;

The Monstrous King’s Soul Mound wasn’t a place for him to pass down his heritage. If anyone coveted the Monstrous King’s soul energy, they would have to find ways to overcome his defensive mechanisms.&nbsp;

As the Monstrous King was a figure from tens of thousands of years ago, the Godwish Grandmother and the others weren’t certain of his exact strength. They weren’t confident of overcoming the defensive mechanisms he had constructed, so they invited close friends from other galaxies to help them.&nbsp;

They were none other than the elders of the Starspecter Valley, Silver Crane Hall, and Soaringflow Heaven Sect. There was one more powerhouse amongst them, and she was an elder from the Situ World Spiritist Clan.&nbsp;

The elder didn’t accompany the Godwish Grandmother, the Lady of Dao Sea, and the others to conduct a preliminary exploration of the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound, which meant that the rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator they had sensed earlier was her.&nbsp;
