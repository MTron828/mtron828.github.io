MGA: Chapter 1371 - Dissatisfied

“Could it be that you still think that you can win?”

Huang Feng curled his lip in a very mocking manner. The way he saw it, he believed that he had already obtained absolute victory, that Chu Feng had no chance of victory at all.

Even though Chu Feng’s medicine concocting ability was extremely skillful, he firmly believed that he surpassed Chu Feng in controlling the temperature of the fire.

“Whether I can win or not will be determined by the truth.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he moved with a thought , opening the cauldron that had previously been sealed. As the medicine concocting cauldron was opened, ‘woosh, woosh, woosh’ sounds began to be heard nonstop. At the same time, numerous golden lights began to shoot explosively out of the cauldron.

At the time when the golden lights stopped shooting out, everyone present was displaying an expression of shock.

At this moment, everyone, whether near or far, was dead quiet. The only thing that could be heard was the pulse of their hearts.

All of those lights were High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets. Furthermore, there was a total of two hundred of them floating before Chu Feng.

Two hundred High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets, Chu Feng had only used a bit more time than that Huang Feng, yet he had concocted a total of two hundred High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets. As such, how could the crowd present not be shocked?

“Im, im, impossible! This is definitely impossible! You’ve definitely cheated! You were most definitely cheating! How is it possible for you to concoct this many High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets in such a short period of time?” Huang Feng cried out in disbelief.

“Heh, is this the reaction of a sore loser who is unable to take defeat with grace? Saying that I’ve cheated? Can’t you all think of something new?”

“Firstly, it doesn’t matter whether or not you are a world spiritist, because you do not possess the ability to determine whether or not I’ve cheated. Look, there are this many senior world spiritists present. Their eyes are way sharper than yours.”

“How could they not tell whether or not I’ve cheated? If I had cheated, would they not stop me? Is there even a need for you to complain after losing?” Chu Feng refuted.

“I, with my status as a royal-cloak world spiritist, will vouch that little friend Chu Feng has not cheated. He concocted the two hundred High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets through his skillful world spirit techniques.”

“Even though I feel very shocked to see little friend Chu Feng, with his young age, being able to concoct this many High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets in such a short period of time, I must admit that this is little friend Chu Feng’s personal strength,” Right at this time, Old Village Chief Ma suddenly spoke. He was actually vouching for Chu Feng.

“He really relied on his strength? This Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques are this powerful?”

After hearing what Old Village Chief Ma said, the expressions of the crowd changed once again. At the beginning, they had been doubtful of Chu Feng’s achievement. However, after hearing Old Village Chief Ma, a grand royal-cloak world spiritist, vouching for Chu Feng, they no longer doubted Chu Feng’s accomplishment.

After all, Old Village Chief Ma was someone who possessed a very high amount of prestige in the Alliance Domain.

However, upon thinking of how Chu Feng had relied on his own strength to concoct this many High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets in such a short period of time, they were unable to contain their shock. They were so shocked that even their souls began to tremble.

To have such strength at such a young age, his talent was simply dreadfully shocking, something that no one could match up against.

“Even senior Ma has spoken out, are you still trying to refuse to admit your defeat? While it is fine for you to say that you’re unable to accept your defeat with grace, the things that I won must be given to me,” Chu Feng spoke. His tone was very ordinary. However, his attitude was very unyielding.

“Th, that’s right. T, tur, turns out th, that the gr, grand geniuses from the Wo, World Spiritist Alliance are act, actually a bunch of vile c, characters, so, sore losers unable to take defeat wi, with grace. The way I s, see it, you mi, might as well te, tear down the signboard of the World Spir, Spiritist Alliance. Lea, leaving it would on, only be a dis, disgrace,” Wang Qiang said mockingly.

While the others were afraid of criticizing the people from the World Spiritist Alliance, Wang Qiang did not care about them at all.

“Who dares to say that I am a sore loser unable to take defeat with grace?! Here, take it!” Huang Feng’s expression was gloomy, so gloomy that he could kill someone. However, he ended up clenching his teeth and throwing the vase that contained a hundred thousand drops of Sealing Glacial Water to Chu Feng.

After he received the vase, Chu Feng nodded his head, satisfied. There were a hundred thousand drops of Sealing Glacial Water in there; not a single drop was missing.

Huang Feng had not even managed to use a single drop of the Sealing Glacial Water before it had been lost to Chu Feng. It was truly a wonder what sort of feeling he was feeling right now.

However, the reason why Chu Feng had risked offending the World Spiritist Alliance to challenge Huang Feng was not merely because of these hundred thousand drops of Sealing Glacial Water. What he wanted was that piece of the Sealing Glacier. That had been his purpose in coming to the Sealing Ancient Village in the first place.

“Where’s that Sealing Glacier?” Chu Feng asked.

“Go and get the Sealing Glacier from senior Ma, he has yet to give me that,” Huang Feng said furiously. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Hearing that, Chu Feng said to Old Village Chief Ma, “Senior Ma, I must trouble you.” He had won it, thus, he must take it. That piece of the Sealing Glacier was crucial to him.

“Wait a moment, leaving right away after winning, isn’t this going against the rules?” Right at this time, Sun Lei spoke.

“Why, are you unconvinced?” Chu Feng turned around and asked with a smile on his face.

“Of course I’m unconvinced. This time, I shall compete with you. Do you dare?” Sun Lei asked.

“Dare? Haha... you should be asking yourself that,” Chu Feng smiled complacently.

He was able to tell that Huang Feng’s world spirit techniques were inferior to Sima Ying’s, and this Sun Lei’s world spirit techniques were inferior to even Huang Feng’s. Thus, how could he be afraid of a challenge from Sun Lei? The way he saw it, this was nothing more than a joke.

“Don’t agree to it so frankly, for what I want to compete in is not world spirit techniques,” Sun Lei said.

“In that case, what do you wish to compete in?” Chu Feng asked nonchalantly.

“I wish to compete in a true battle between men, a battle of fists and feet to determine victory,” Sun Lei said.

“What? You wish to compete with me by fighting?” After Chu Feng heard those words, his eyes were wide open. He appeared to be in disbelief.

“Why? Are you afraid? Truly a coward. Earlier, you showed all that confidence, yet it turns out that you’re nothing more than a coward. So much for the Cyanwood Mountain that focuses on martial cultivation,” Sun Lei said with deep mockery.

“No, I’m not afraid,” Chu Feng said.

“Then?” Sun Lei asked.

“Oh, I merely wanted to say that it’s just what I wanted,” Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed. He started to laugh, a laugh that was filled with confidence.

“You... you’re truly boastfully arrogant,” Hearing Chu Feng’s response, Sun Lei was angered. That was because Chu Feng’s behavior was truly too arrogant. As a battle fiend, very rarely had Sun Lei ever been provoked by someone of his same generation in such a manner. Thus, how could he possibly be able to restrain himself? As he spoke, Sun Lei’s martial power began to surge, he was preparing to attack Chu Feng.

“You wish to fight already? Don’t rush into these things. I know you’re most definitely trying to win back the Sealing Glacial Water by competing with me, right?”

“However, you are nevertheless required to put forth a gambling stake of comparable value. Else, wouldn’t I be losing out enormously?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.

“This...”

Hearing those words, Sun Lei was stunned. He had only been thinking about competing with Chu Feng, teaching him a lesson on behalf of Huang Feng, seizing back the face of their World Spiritist Alliance and winning back the Sealing Glacial Water.

However, he had completely forgotten that he was required to present a gambling stake. After all, he did not possess anything that valuable on him.

“I’ll present the gambling stake on his behalf. This Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter, what do you think?” Huang Feng raised the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter and spoke with a loud voice.

“What? He’s going to use the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter as the gambling stake?” As they saw the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter, the eyes of all of the world spiritists present began to shine. They all wanted to obtain that treasure. Unfortunately, they did not have the opportunity.

However, before their eyes, Chu Feng was being given the opportunity. Although others might not know it, they were people who knew that not only did Chu Feng possess very amazing world spirit techniques, his battle power was also extremely astonishing. Back then, the battle between Chu Feng and Wang Qiang outside of the Sealing Ancient Village had stunned many people.

If Sun Lei were to compete in battle power against Zhou Long and his siblings, he would definitely be able to win. After all, his strong battle power was something that he was famous for.

However, if Sun Lei were to compete with Chu Feng in battle power, they did not believe that the winner and the loser would be predetermined.

“I’m afraid that that by itself is insufficient to use as a gambling stake for both the hundred thousand drops of Sealing Glacial Water and the piece of Sealing Glacier,” To everyone’s surprise, even though Huang Feng had taken out the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter, Chu Feng was still dissatisfied.
