Chapter 5834: Puppeteer Exalted

The one blocking the road wore a black cloak that covered their physique and face, but the fact that they dared to block the floating warship that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief was on showed how brazen they was.

The first thought that came to everyone’s mind was that the other party was here to cause trouble.

The only one on the floating warship who remained composed was the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief. He walked out and said, “You have been waiting for me here.”

The person in the black cloak clasped their fist and said, “Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief, you may address me as Puppeteer Exalted.”

“Puppeteer Exalted?”

Everyone from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was taken aback.

Puppeteer Exalted was a little-known and mysterious figure, but they had heard about him, albeit this being their first meeting. They heard that he was related to the Ancient Era’s races.

“Do you need something from me?” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“I have come to propose a cooperation with the Immortal Sea Fish Clan,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

“Regarding what?” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“There’s a power in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy known as the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. It’s a mysterious sect that has declined with time, but it has a strong foundation. They have a secret realm containing treasures comparable to the most powerful remnants in the present era.

“I know a way to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s secret realm, and I have rallied many powers to cooperate with us, including those from the Ancient Era. The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect won’t be able to stop us no matter how powerful they are. I’d be honored if the Immortal Sea Fish Clan joins us on this endeavor,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

“Our Immortal Sea Fish Clan is not interested,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

“Have I not made myself clear? I’m aware that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan has a strong foundation, but the treasures inside the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect can greatly bolster your clan’s prowess. In the wake of God’s Era...”

Before Puppeteer Exalted could finish his words, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief interjected, “You have made yourself clear. I caught your drift. I’ll repeat myself once more. Our Immortal Sea Fish Clan isn’t interested.”

“Hah... Sorry to have disturbed” Puppeteer Exalted shook his head. He clasped his fist before taking his leave.

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.”

The Puppeteer Exalted’s footsteps halted when he heard those words from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief. He turned around and asked, “Clan Chief, is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master here too?”

“Mansion Master, you can openly attack the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. You don’t have to beat around the bush. This is unlike someone of your stature,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Clan Chief, you have gotten the wrong person. I am not the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master,” Puppeteer Exalted replied.

“Is that so? I must have gotten the wrong person,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief replied with an enigmatic smile.

“Hehehe...” Puppeteer Exalted smiled as well. He turned around and left the scene.

“Father, is that person the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master?” Xianhai Shaoyu stepped forward and asked.

“My instincts are telling me it’s him,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

“Is he planning on attacking the Ancestral Martial Galaxy? Is his goal Chu Feng?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“He should know that Chu Feng is not in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy at the moment. He’s likely trying to dig up people who are related to Chu Feng, or that he really has other plans in mind,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

He suddenly turned around—Little Fishy was planning to jump off the boat. With a thought, he bound Little Fishy in place.

“Let me go, father!” Little Fishy struggled.

“Yu’er, Chu Feng won’t be able to stop this. Informing him will only bring danger upon him,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“I know, but I have to tell big brother! He’ll blame himself if something happens to his friends and family because of him,” Little Fishy said.

“I have looked into it. Chu Feng’s friends and family have vanished. Either Chu Feng or his father must have hidden them away. As for the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, Chu Feng is indeed one of their members, but it won’t be exposed that easily.

“Yu’er, this matter will shake up the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but it has nothing much to do with Chu Feng. Many people might die in the process, but none of them are close to Chu Feng,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Little Fishy lowered her head. Her first thought was to inform Chu Feng of the matter and let him make his own decision, but she also hoped for him to be safe too.

“There’s another possibility,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“What is it, father?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“This might be a trap prepared for Chu Feng,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

“A trap?”

The crowd hadn’t thought of this.

“If this operation was carried out privately, the goal might be to dig up more information about Chu Feng. Supposing my deduction is off, and Puppeteer Exalted is after the secret realm filled with treasures, it doesn’t make sense for him to spread this matter widely. The only possibility is that it’s a trap intended for Chu Feng.”

The Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief turned to Little Fishy. “Even if you don’t make a move, Chu Feng will surely hear about it.”

“The darned Seven Realms Sacred Mansion! They ought to be wiped out!” Little Fishy was infuriated. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“That’s how this world has always worked. Be it the present era, the Ancient Era, or the Immemorial Era, it has always been the survival of the fittest. It’s the strong who make the rules. If you don’t like it, you’ll have to become stronger than them and trample them with your feet, so that they can’t hurt the people you care for,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“I will,” Little Fishy replied.

“I know. The two of you will bring our Immortal Sea Fish Clan to greater heights. I have never doubted that. However, I don’t think you have to deal with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Father, do you know someone who’ll deal with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

The Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head before replying, “Haven’t you been praising Chu Feng in front of me, saying how he’s formidable, possesses great talent, and that there’s nothing he can’t do? I believe it now. I believe your good friend will become an amazing cultivator. It can’t be that you’re losing confidence in him now that I have begun to trust him?”

“Of course I have confidence in him!” Little Fishy exclaimed.

“Then you shouldn’t worry about it. He has come this far with his strength. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion might look terrifying to you, but he might see them in a different light. He has faced many such so-called impossible challenges, only to emerge victorious every single time. It might not be different to him this time,” the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Xianhai Shaoyu smiled upon hearing those words. “Father is right. I’d like to help him as a friend, but in truth, I don’t think he needs my help at all.”
