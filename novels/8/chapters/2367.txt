Chapter 2367 - Mysterious Life Form

“Huu, huu, huu~~~”

Following the miserable screams from Zhao Hong, Wang Qiang and Kong Cheng, the pond water started to whirl, forming an enormous surging whirlpool.

Soon, three figures appeared in the center of the whirlpool. They were precisely Zhao Hong, Wang Qiang and Kong Cheng.

Merely, only their upper bodies were exposed. Furthermore, their complexions were all abnormally pale, and their expressions pained. It was clear that some sort of power was tormenting them.

Upon seeing their appearances, Chu Feng and Kong Zheng revealed worried expressions.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk...”

Right at that moment, a strange and sinister laughter sounded from the center of the vortex.

“Who is it? Why did you attack my friends?” Chu Feng asked coldly.

“I am the master of this place. They intruded into my territory. What wrong is there for me to attack them?” That strange voice sounded again. It was extremely sinister and cold. Merely by hearing the voice, one’s hair would stand on end, and one would feel as if one’s blood was running cold. It was as if that voice was simply not the voice of a human.

“Impudent! Who is it that dared to touch my big brother Kong Cheng? You should know that my big brother Kong Cheng is from the Kong Heavenly Clan!!!” That Kong Zheng shouted.

“Eaaahhh!!!”

However, right after Kong Zheng said those words, Kong Cheng, who was trapped in the water, let out an even more miserable scream.

“Bastard! Release my big brother Kong Cheng immediately! Else, our Kong Heavenly Clan will definitely not let you get away with it!” Kong Zheng grew even more panicked. He knew that since their opponent was able to subdue Kong Cheng, it meant it was an existence that he absolutely could not contend against. With no other alternative, Kong Zheng could only continue to voice threats.

“Ahhh!!!”

“No, stop! Stop immediately!!!”

However, Kong Cheng’s screams grew more and more hysterical; more and more painful.

Merely by hearing his screams, one could imagine how terrifying the torture Kong Cheng was undergoing right now was.

“Hahaha, this is too funny. Is that guy by the name of Kong Zheng a fool?” At that moment, Her Lady Queen was convulsing with laughter. She was wholeheartedly laughing at Kong Zheng’s lack of intelligence.

The reason for that was because it was very clear that the mysterious existence was deliberately tormenting Kong Cheng to make Kong Zheng shut up because it was dissatisfied with Kong Zheng threatening it.

Yet, Kong Zheng did not manage to comprehend what that mysterious existence wanted it to do, and instead continued to threaten it. This caused Kong Cheng to suffer much greater torment than Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang.

If it were to continue, he would likely die.

Feeling helpless, Chu Feng said to Kong Zheng, “If you do not want to cause his death, shut up immediately.”

“If you want to kill him, then continue to bring up your clan.”

“Ah?”

“What?”

“It’s because of me?!!!!”

Hearing what Chu Feng said, that Kong Zheng came to a sudden realization. However, he was at a loss as to what to do. Thus, he sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng, “Then... what should I do?”

“We do not know who our opponent is. However, it is clear they do not fear your Kong Heavenly Clan. You have already enraged him earlier with your threats. If you wish to defuse its anger, the only thing you can do is apologize,” Chu Feng said.

“Senior, I-I am sorry. It was truly not my intention to speak rudely to you. I was merely extremely worried about my elder brother’s safety.”

“Senior, this junior will offer my apologies to you here. Please, I hope that you can release my elder brother.”

Although that Kong Zheng possessed a haughty attitude, it would seem that he truly possessed a very good relationship with Kong Cheng. Thus, after he received Chu Feng’s advice, he immediately offered an apology without the slightest hesitation.

“That’s more like it,” Sure enough, after that Kong Zheng grew soft, a satisfied voice sounded from the pond water.

At the same time, Kong Cheng stopped screaming in pain.

In fact, it was not only Kong Cheng. Even Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong’s expressions grew much better.

It would seem that mysterious existence had stopped tormenting the three of them.

“Crash~~~”

Immediately afterward, water began to surge in between the three. Soon, a figure appeared.

It was a humanoid monster. It possessed a humanoid shape, but did not resemble a human at all.

Its body was different from that of humans. To be precise, it simply did not possess a physical body at all. Instead, it was filled with flowing mud from head to toe. It looked like a person made of clay.

Logically, someone like Chu Feng, who had experienced a lot of things, would not be shocked by a clay man.

The reason for that was because the appearance of the clay man could simply not be considered to be frightening when compared to those frightening existences.

However, not only did this clay man possess a sinister and strange voice, it also possessed a pair of empty sockets for eyes. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although there were no eyeballs in those sockets, they emitted ice-cold killing intent. From the moment Chu Feng saw its eyes, Chu Feng felt as if his heart had been frozen.

Chu Feng had a sensation. He felt as if this thing that he was meeting eye-to-eye was not an ordinary life form. Rather, it was a death god.

Although Chu Feng knew that it would be impossible for that mysterious clay man to be the legendary death god, its ice-cold killing intent had already revealed that it was a cold-blooded existence that murdered without blinking an eye. As such, Chu Feng did not dare to act carelessly.

“The two of you must want them to live, right?” That mysterious existence asked.

“Of course,” Chu Feng and Kong Zheng replied in unison.

“If you want them to live, then it’s very simple. You merely need to do as I say,” That mysterious existence said.

“Please tell us what you want,” Chu Feng said frankly.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng knew that he did not possess the ability to haggle at a time like this. Only by obeying would it be possible for him to save Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

“First, you are not allowed to find reinforcements. If any of you dare to find reinforcements, I dare to guarantee that you will no longer be able to see your friends.”

“Next, you are to go to the Hundred Refinements Stage and obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone for me,” That mysterious existence said.

“Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone?!!!!” Hearing those words, Kong Zheng’s expression immediately changed.

“That’s right, the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone!!!”

“I will release the friends of whichever one of you two first obtains the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone for me. As for the one who fails to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, I’d urge you not to come back. Not only will you die, your friends will also die,” That mysterious existence said.

“We are able to agree to this condition of yours. However, I have a request.”

“We will bring back the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. However, you must release all of our friends,” Chu Feng said.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk...” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, that mysterious existence let out a strange laugh. Then, with a mocking tone, it said, “You do not possess the ability to demand things from me. You can either do as I say, or your friends will die.”

“Senior, this junior understands. Please don’t harm my elder brother again. No matter what, I will definitely bring back the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone for you.”

Although that Kong Zheng possessed a low level of intelligence, he was able to understand the demands of that mysterious existence. Thus, after he finished saying those words, he immediately turned around and rushed toward the direction of the Hundred Refinements Stage with all his might.

After his intention to haggle ended in failure, Chu Feng also stopped trying to bother with superfluous words with that mysterious existence. Instead, he looked to Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

At that moment, Zhao Hong did not speak. In fact, she did not even look Chu Feng in the eye. Likely, she was feeling ashamed that she hadn’t listened to Chu Feng and rashly rushed into the pond water only to end up like this.

As for Wang Qiang, he opened his large mouth and said to Chu Feng with a laugh, “B-brother, s-sorry. I s-should’ve listened to you. Now I’ll have to in-incon-inconvenience you again.”

Although Wang Qiang laughed indifferently, the tone that he spoke with was very apologetic.

Faced with Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong’s current reactions, Chu Feng smiled lightly and said, “If you consider me a brother, don’t say such a thing. No matter what, I will definitely save you two.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, his gaze suddenly grew serious. He looked to that mysterious existence and said, “I will do as you say. However, I also hope that you will keep your promise. If something is to happen to my friends when I return with what you requested, I guarantee... that you will regret your actions.”

“Woosh~~~”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, his body shifted, and he flew toward the direction that Kong Zheng had left in.

Even though Chu Feng had also threatened it, that mysterious existence did not torment Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. Instead, a trace of complicated emotions appeared in its eyes. With a low voice, it muttered, “This brat...”
