Chapter 4055 - Filled With Emotions

Wuming Doutian’s expression changed drastically.

He appeared to be feeling very unwell.

He wasn’t even able to speak properly almost as if he’d received an enormous shock,

Only after a long time had passed was he able to gradually relax.

He looked at Lanfu Longping, “Lord Longping, is it re-really them? Could it be that they didn’t die?”

“Furthermore, they went to the Nine Souls Galaxy?”

Wuming Doutian’s voice trembled as he spoke.

“I can’t be certain. However, based on the description provided by the witnesses, it really does resemble them.”

After saying those words, the frown on Lanfu Longping’s face grew more intense.

“They’re the ones that wiped out the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect?”

“Such a thing was really done by Chu Xuanyuan?”

“If it was really done by him, wouldn’t it mean...”

Before Wuming Doutian could finish, Lanfu Longping interrupted, “If it really was done by him, it would mean that no one in your entire Holy Light Galaxy is able to contend against him now.”

“As for my Blue Talisman Clan, we are also unable to contend against him.”

“This!” Wuming Doutian was already sweating profusely. Furthermore, his sweat was ice-cold.

Even his breathing had become difficult.

Different from the others, he had fought Chu Xuanyuan before.

Back then, he had even attempted to kill him.

That was why he was so deeply afraid. It was because of his actions in the past.

Afraid. It was only natural that he’d be afraid.

The person that he’d fought against in the past was actually such a monster. Even the people he believed to be gods had been wiped out by him.

Thus, how could he not be afraid?!

Thinking about what he’d done in the past and the fact that he’d attempted to kill Chu Xuanyuan, he realized that he had been breaking ground above Tai Sui’s head.

[1. Breaking ground above Tai Sui’s head. Tai Sui is an alias for the most powerful individual. This phrase basically means ‘messing with the most powerful guy.’]

When those thoughts crossed his mind, Wuming Doutian felt as if his life was about to end.

“We still can’t be certain that it’s really him.”

“Without sufficient evidence, I am merely guessing too.”

“If possible, I truly hope for it to not have been done by him.”

“But, I am afraid, afraid that the one who did it is indeed him.”

“If he has truly grown that powerful, and Lanfu Jianpeng ends up wiping out his Chu Heavenly Clan, he would really have courted a major disaster,” said Lanfu Longping.

“Milord, faster, you must go faster.”

“We must stop Lord Jianpeng.” Wuming Doutian urged in an alarmed voice.

“Is there even a need for you to tell me that? Am I not pursuing that bastard with all my strength?” Lanfu Longping felt very helpless.

He was truly going all-out in his pursuit. He was not only going all-out after learning Lanfu Jianpeng had left to wipe out the Chu Heavenly Clan. Instead, throughout his entire journey from the Nine Souls Galaxy to the Holy Light Galaxy and then inquiring about the Wuming Clan’s whereabouts, he had been going all-out the entire time.

Lanfu Longping was actually very exhausted already.

But, for the sake of preventing Lanfu Jianpeng from courting a disaster, he still went all-out in his pursuit.

“No, Milord, you’ve come late. Perhaps you still do not know the concrete details.”

“It is not only the Chu Heavenly Clan, that Chu Xuanyuan’s son is currently inside the Chu Heavenly Clan too,” said Wuming Doutian.

“What? His son is also there?”

“You’re talking about that person of the younger generation by the name of Chu Feng?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Hearing those words, Lanfu Longping’s expression turned even uglier.

“Yes. Lord Jianpeng went to the Chu Heavenly Clan precisely so that he could take the life of Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” said Wuming Doutian.

“Damn it!”

“Lanfu Jianpeng, you’re truly about to court a major disaster!”

Lanfu Longping started gnashing his teeth with rage.

Then, his speed actually increased by a lot.

However, when Lanfu Longping’s speed increased, Wuming Doutian’s expression changed again.

He was able to see that Lanfu Longping was emitting a special sort of gaseous flames. The scent of blood was actually present in the gaseous flames.

For the sake of increasing his speed, Lanfu Longping... had actually used a forbidden technique to burn his own bloodline!

.......

Inside the Chu Heavenly Clan. The atmosphere was one of overwhelming delight.

It was an unprecedented carousel.

Their joy naturally came from Chu Feng’s victory over Wuming Doutian.

Not only was the Chu Heavenly Clan able to properly hold the position of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s overlord, but they had also shattered the giant mountain crushing down on them from above.

That said, Chu Feng was not celebrating with the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

He had arrived at the border of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.

He stood above a mountain, and looked ahead.

There was a very grand and imposing spirit formation that connected heaven and earth at the location he was looking at.

It was the grand formation that protected the Chu Heavenly Clan. It also served as the boundary of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.

Inside the spirit formation was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s final fort. It was a place the Chu Heavenly Clansmen relied on to survive.

A lot of people were gathered outside the grand spirit formation. The great majority of them were not from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but other upper realms instead.

Furthermore, more and more people were gathering outside.

They were all people that had come to pay their respects to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The great majority of them were people that had witnessed the battle between Chu Feng and Wuming Doutian earlier in the day.

Had it been before, those people would most definitely have been invited into the Chu Heavenly Clan and entertained as distinguished guests.

Yet at that moment they were all refused and had to wait outside the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.

The reason for that was because the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s had issued an order. He declared that if people did not come for anything important and had merely come to pay them a visit, they would not be allowed to enter the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The reason for this enormous change was actually what had happened earlier in the day.

Everyone knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was able to be the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield because of Chu Feng.

Even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief himself knew this.

However, he still put forth his best effort into handling every single matter of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Even though he knew that the people that came to pay him visits were only there to make relationships and curry favors, he still ordered his people to receive them cordially.

Yet, earlier, when the Wuming Clan had come to seize their overlord status, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had actually been spurned and even insulted by those people.

This saddened the heart of the old clan chief. At the same time, it made him realize one thing.

Being sincere to others might not necessarily result in being able to receive sincerity from others. This was especially true in their world where might was right. In their world, people revered strength more than benevolence and righteousness.

That was why he had given the order to refuse those people.

He had decided to continue to manage the Ancestral Martial Starfield before Chu Feng succeeded his position.

However, he would not blindly treat everyone in a cordial manner.

He would continue to handle things impartially and would try his best to allow the various powers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to get along peacefully. He would continue to try to make the Ancestral Martial Starfield into a more auspicious and peaceful place.

But, he would no longer waste time entertaining those hypocrites.

Chu Feng stood atop the mountain and looked outside. He looked at the people that had clearly been refused but were still praising the Chu Heavenly Clan; praising him nonstop.

Seeing that, he sighed with regret at how fickle human nature was.

That said, his train of thought did not linger on this.

He also remembered the past, and all the things he had experienced.

Back when he had first arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he had been crushed to a state of almost stifling by, not to mention the Chu Heavenly Clan, mere small powers.

At that time, he had been truly small, truly weak.

The grand spirit formation that had blocked all the various powers outside was equally unwelcoming to him back then.

However at that moment, not only had Chu Feng entered it, but he had even become the pillar of the Chu Heavenly Clan. He was a hero who had saved the Chu Heavenly Clan from their calamity.

No one in the Chu Heavenly Clan dared to refuse to acknowledge him.

Furthermore, they admired him and acknowledged him with sincerity from the bottoms of their hearts.

The abandoned child that had been looked down on by everyone had changed his fate in defiance of the natural order and had become the overlord of Ancestral Martial Starfield.
