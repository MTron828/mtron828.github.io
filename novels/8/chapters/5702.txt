Chapter 5702: Chu Feng Is Dead?

The powerhouses were taken aback by the eight names they had seen.

While they had never heard about Feng Ling, the powerhouses had heard rumors of a formidable junior in Bloodline Galaxy. Thus, they associated Feng Ling with that formidable junior, so this outcome was still reasonable for them.

But…

Who in the world was Jie Tian? Wasn’t Ling Xiao the representative of the Seven Realms Galaxy in the previous Nine Heaven’s Zenith? Where did this Jie Tian pop out from?

Was Jie Tian really capable enough to replace Ling Xiao?

Even those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were taken aback, let alone outsiders.

Ling Xiao was known as the strongest junior in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, after all. While Ling Sheng’er had outstanding talent too, her powers had yet to mature.

In contrast, they hadn’t even heard of Jie Tian at all.

…

Xianhai Yu’er’s being on the list also stirred a controversy.

Many people had heard about Xianhai Yu’er’s talent, but Xianhai Shaoyu was so outstanding that most had heard about his feats. In fact, many considered him to be the strongest junior. Even Ling Xiao, Qin Xuan, Long Chengyu, and the other renowned prodigies had to take a back seat compared to him.

Many believed that Xianhai Shaoyu was a notch above the others. Some even called him the Jie Ranqing of the current generation.

Xianhai Shaoyu’s reputation was so resounding that it was hard for the world to believe that Xianhai Yu’er could surpass him, not to mention that Xianhai Yu’er was still young.

If the world only saw Xianhai Yu’er’s name as a controversy, the other names looked utterly inconceivable to them.

Who in the world was Wang Qiang? Shouldn’t the strongest junior of the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion be the Mansion Master’s grandson, Yuwen Yanri?

There weren't many people who had seen Yuwen Yanri, as he was quite an elusive figure, but it was common consensus among those from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion that he was the strongest junior.

Where in the world did Wang Qiang come from?

And who was Xian Miaomiao too? Didn’t the Nine Souls Galaxy spiral into decline, just like the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?

The Nine Souls Galaxy was a galaxy in name, but most considered it no different from a remote countryside. Any expert from the Western Region, the Southern Region, or the Northern Region could easily reign as king there. They were just unwilling to do so because there was no glory in doing so.

Why was Xian Miaomiao able to receive an invitation from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith?

Could it be that a slot was reserved for every galaxy, and Xian Miaomiao was there because she was the strongest junior of the Nine Souls Galaxy, albeit being weaker than the others?

The crowd thought that this was plausible.

Even though Chu Feng’s reputation had surged after wreaking havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, he had only made use of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s formation here. Ultimately, it was still the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that was the strong one here.

They felt that even though Chu Feng was a prodigy too, there was still a gap between him and the other top-tier prodigies such as Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan, let alone Xianhai Shaoyu. If that was the case for Chu Feng, it could be the same for Xian Miaomiao too.

Even though the crowd had never met Xian Miaomiao, they didn’t think highly of her simply because she was from the Nine Souls Galaxy.

…

Meanwhile, Jie Tian was taking in the powerful and concentrated spirit power lingering in one of the Sacred Mansion’s forbidden lands. This was an invaluable cultivation resource, but it was solely dominated by him.

However, Jie Tian’s attention was on the sky instead of cultivating. The Heavens Ranking was so powerful that he could see its content despite being inside a forbidden land.

“Grandfather,” Jie Tian greeted as he quickly stood up. “I didn’t mean to get distracted. The Heavens Ranking simply caused too huge of a commotion.”

“The Nine Heavens’ Zenith Heavens Ranking is indeed formidable. A day will come where I’ll scale the Nine Heavens’ Zenith to examine the formation,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“I believe you’ll be able to do it, grandfather,” Jie Tian replied confidently.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master smiled. He had been in a terrible mood recently, so it had been a long time since he showed such a smile.

“How is it, Tian’er? You have been invited. Are you interested in attending?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Can I?” Jie Tian asked with inconcealable anticipation in his eyes.

“You may go, but didn’t you previously lose to Xianhai Yu’er? She has been invited to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith too. Are you confident of defeating her?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Of course. She was lucky she had the formation armor blessing her. I would have never lost to her in a normal fight,” Jie Tian replied.

“That’s good, Tian’er. I’ll be counting on you to salvage our reputation,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Rest assured, grandfather.” Jie Tian was excited, only for his face to turn grim right after. “Grandfather, when was our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master impaired?”

“Tian’er, you didn’t know what happened outside since you were in closed-door training. Just a few days ago, our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was embarrassed by an outsider.” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master proceeded to share the story with Jie Tian.

“That bastard, Chu Feng! Don’t worry, grandfather. He’d never dare to make his way to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith even if he survived the formation. I’ll make sure to take his life if he goes,” Jie Tian replied with gritted teeth.

It was then that the Heavens Ranking changed, and this change was even more shocking than before. A powerful energy descended from the sky to envelop the world of cultivation.

“Grandfather,” Jie Tian looked at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, for the Heavens Ranking had imbued him with its energy.

Soon, words appeared on the Heavens Ranking.

The energy was reserved for those who were invited. If they wished so, they could head to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith right away. If they didn’t respond within a set time, it would be assumed that they had chosen to relinquish their invitation.

“Go, Tian’er. You are the pride of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It’s time for you to appear before the world. I’ll let everyone know that you’re Jie Mubai and Jie Tiannian’s son, as well as my grandson,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

Jie Tian’s eyes lit up. He had been waiting for this day for a long time, and it had finally arrived.

“Rest assured, grandfather. I will not let you down.”

Jie Tian pointed his finger at the sky. A pillar of light rushed into the sky and fused with Heavens Ranking. Soon, Jie Tian’s name became exceptionally bright on the invitation list, a sign that he had accepted the invitation.

Inside the restaurant, the three members of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who had confronted Feng Ling looked at her in a different light. Their earlier arrogance had been replaced with disbelief and fear.

In particular, when Feng Ling pointed her finger at the sky, and a pillar of light rushed to the sky and onto the Heavens Ranking, their faces turned ghastly pale.

They didn’t really believe it when Feng Ling said that she knew Chu Feng earlier; they thought that she was only bragging. Nevertheless, they thought that she deserved to die for it. In truth, they had already intended to kill her from the moment she revealed her identity.

Never would they have imagined that she was the Bloodline Galaxy’s Feng Ling.

The Bloodline Galaxy’s prodigy was known to be a fearless and vicious person. The more they remembered the rumors surrounding that prodigy, the more flustered they felt.

After exchanging gazes, they wanted to turn tail and flee.

Uwa!

Before they could get away, the three of them cried in agony. An invisible surge of energy swept across the restaurant, and blood splattered from them. Just like that, they were dead.

Feng Ling looked at Li Wu and exclaimed, “Big sister, I was going to do it myself! Why did you steal my job?”

It turned out that Li Wu was the one who killed them, but Li Wu ignored Feng Ling and turned to the sky. Of the eight names listed on the Heavens Ranking, six had responded. The only ones who had yet to do so were Long Chengyu and Chu Feng.

The Heavens Ranking lasted for an entire day, but there was still no response from Long Chengyu and Chu Feng. This made the world certain that he was dead.

As for Long Chengyu, it wasn’t too surprising given that there was a rebellion in the Totem Dragon Clan. Something unbecoming could have happened to him then.

Right after the Heavens Ranking disappeared, a pair of eyes opened from one of the Seven Realms Galaxy’s Upper Realms.

“I… am alive,” Chu Feng muttered.
