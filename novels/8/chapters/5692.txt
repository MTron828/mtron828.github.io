Chapter 5692: Who’s Despicable?

Chapter 5692: Who’s Despicable?

“Mansion Master, how was Ranqing duped?” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster asked.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master didn’t answer. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, as if to calm himself down, before his opened his eyes and continued, “Ranqing fell in love with that scoundrel and had his child.”

“What?! Jie Ranqing has a child?!”

This matter was a bolt out of the blue.

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were rendered speechless as rage simmered in their hearts. Jie Ranqing was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s most talented prodigy since its founding, as well as the only possessor of the Ruler’s Bloodline.

Yet, she was duped by someone of lovely birth and even gave birth to his child?

It left them with a horrible feeling, knowing that someone they had respected all this while had been defiled by trash.

Tremendous killing intent burst out and shook the Bloodline Square.

“Mansion Master, is this matter for real? You have to properly investigate it,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster asked.

“This matter concerns Ranqing’s reputation. I’d never spout nonsense about it,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

Those words verified the authenticity of those words.

“Lord Mansion Master, who’s that person? I’ll tear him in shreds right away!”

“How can there be someone as disgusting as that? Even massacring his entire clan wouldn’t be enough to vent the anger I feel!”

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were so angry that they really intended to go on a massacre.

“My foolish daughter refuses to tell me where that scoundrel and his child are hiding. That scoundrel’s child should have already grown up by now. What a pity that my daughter and her noble bloodline are wasted on a lowly scoundrel!” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master looked pained as he said those words.

“Lord Mansion Master, are there really no clues at all?” someone amongst the crowd asked.

“There are no clues. Ranqing is too obstinate. Even to this day, she refuses to divulge the whereabouts of that scoundrel and his child. I thought that they would come looking for her if they truly cared about her, but I was wrong. Those pathetic things are cowards! They don’t deserve to continue living in this world! What do the rest of you think?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master exclaimed.

“How dare they dupe Lord Ranqing’s feelings and sully her bloodline? Unforgivable!”

“We should massacre their clansmen and friends too!”

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion furiously roared with clenched jaws.

“That scoundrel deserves death for duping Ranqing, but that little trash is Ranqing’s flesh and blood, after all. I’d have spared him if he dared to step forward to acknowledge his mother, but he refuses to show himself to this day. Thus, I decided not to give them any more chances. It’s time to put things to an end.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master cast his gaze on Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you are a member of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion from this day onward. Your first mission is to look for this lowly father-and-son duo and capture them alive,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

Chu Feng was angered by the insults directed at him and his father, but his expression remained nonchalant. He raised his head, looked at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, and asked, “Lord Mansion Master, there’s something I don’t understand. Have you met that father and son before?”

“Of course not,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

“If so, how can you be certain that man isn’t worthy of Jie Ranqing? How do you know that child is trash?” Chu Feng asked loudly..

“Audacious, Chu Feng!”

Those words invoked angry bellows, as many of the spectators unleashed their oppressive might on Chu Feng. They wouldn’t allow Chu Feng to speak to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master in such a manner.

However, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master stopped their oppressive might. He looked at Chu Feng and asked, “Chu Feng, why would someone as smart as you ask such a foolish question? Since the ancient era, dragons have always been paired with dragons. Even those from humble birth understand that marriage is between two people of equal standing, let alone someone of a noble bloodline.

“Ranqing is the only possessor of the Ruler’s Bloodline. How can a person of low birth possibly be worthy of someone with her noble bloodline? What else can that be if not sullying her bloodline? Even if Ranqing’s bloodline does raise that trash’s talent, how strong can he possibly get with that useless father of his?”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master tried his best to control his emotions, but his anger could still be felt. His anger was not directed toward Chu Feng but the son-in-law and grandson whom he had never met before. He felt that the two of them deserved to die.

“How do you know that they are weak if you have never met them before?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why would they dare not come here if they aren’t weaklings?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

Chu Feng didn’t bother arguing anymore, as he could tell that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had already decided that he and his father were lowly people. Rather, it might be more apt to say that he believed that those outside of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were all lowly people.

There was no point arguing against someone like that.

Thus, Chu Feng smiled.

No one knew why he smiled, but the crowd sensed that there was something amiss about him. His eyes suddenly turned resolute and fearless, and he said, “Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, since you have announced something important today, why don’t I join in with something else as well?”

“Oh?” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master frowned, not understanding why Chu Feng was suddenly acting so weird. “Do you have something to announce?”

Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng began walking toward the Immemorial Bloodline Stone. Someone wanted to stop him, but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master raised his hand, indicating for them not to move.

He didn’t know what Chu Feng was up to, but he was interested to see what the latter was going to do, considering his confident and fearless attitude.

As Chu Feng made his way toward the Immemorial Bloodline Stone, he said, “First, I’d like to say that your Seven Realms Challenge Formation isn’t that difficult.”

He flicked his wrist, and seven bundles of light surfaced from his palm and manifested into seven tokens. Written on them were ‘Monster’, ‘Demon’, ‘Fairy’, ‘Buddha’, ‘Ghost’, ‘Beast’, and ‘Asura’.

Only those who had cleared the Seven Realms Challenge Formation could manifest those tokens.

“Chu Feng… succeeded?” Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were taken aback, as they could tell that the tokens were the real deal.

“I hid the truth because I didn’t want to embarrass your juniors,” Chu Feng said before crushing all of the tokens into bits.

“Chu Feng, are you trying to rebel?!”

His action infuriated the elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, so much so that some even directed their killing intent at him.

Those tokens were regarded as honorary badges in their Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and their juniors cherished it a lot. Chu Feng’s act of crushing them was no different from trampling on their faces.

Yet, Chu Feng wasn’t intimidated by their outburst at all. Instead, he continued walking toward the Immemorial Bloodline Stone as he said, “It’s not just the juniors. It’s the same for the older generation too. Wasn’t there an old man who claimed to be the strongest world spiritist beneath True Dragon? I have confronted him, but it turns out he’s weaker than me.”

Those words induced sneers from the crowd.

“You’re talking nonsense! You aren’t even qualified to cross blows with Lord Canghai!”

“Oh? Isn’t he already dead?” Chu Feng asked.

“What?” The crowd was taken aback.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and the higher-ranking elders were startled. This matter had been kept confidential, so how could Chu Feng have known about it?

“Are you surprised?” Chu Feng looked at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. “You don’t have to be. The answer is obvious. I was the one who killed him.”

With a flick of his wrist, he took out a human head. It was Ling Canghai’s head.

There was no faking it, as it was still emanating Ling Canghai’s aura.

Practically everyone in the crowd was crushing Chu Feng with their killing intent now. Chu Feng was challenging their honor and dignity. He deserved to be killed on the spot!

Yet, there was no one who made a move. There was no doubt in their mind that Chu Feng would die today, but they knew that it wasn’t their place to make a move. Instead, they turned their eyes to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, waiting for his verdict.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was taken aback, but he wasn’t as angry as the others expected. He stared hard at Chu Feng, hoping to see through him, but it was to no avail. In the end, he asked, “Who are you?”

“Who am I?”

By then, Chu Feng was already standing before the Immemorial Bloodline Stone. He took another step forward and stood on top of it.

Boom!

The world shook, and a blinding light suffused the surroundings.

The infuriated crowd fell silent, for they could feel a terrifying pressure coming from the sky crushing their souls. They looked upward, only for their complexions to turn awful.

A gigantic pillar of light had risen from the Immemorial Bloodline Stone, forming a humongous avatar of a throne. The same avatar appeared behind Chu Feng as well. This phenomenon could only have been induced by a possessor of the Ruler’s Bloodline.

“He… possesses the Ruler’s Bloodline too?”

The crowd couldn’t believe what they were seeing, be it the elders, juniors, outsiders, or even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

But this pressure and phenomenon couldn’t be faked!

Jie Ranqing was no longer the only possessor of the Ruler’s Bloodline, but how could Chu Feng be worthy of having such a noble bloodline too? Who in the world was he?

Before everyone’s flabbergasted eyes, Chu Feng turned around and looked at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. The latter couldn’t remain calm anymore.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master stared at Chu Feng as he asked with a quivering voice, “Who… are you?”

“Who am I? Mansion Master, I, Chu Feng, am the lowly trash you spoke about.”

Then, he stomped his feet, and nine terrifying streaks of lightning burst forth from the Immemorial Bloodline Stone and gushed into the sky. The nine lightning beasts dominated the sky along with the throne avatar, perhaps even overshadowing it a little.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
