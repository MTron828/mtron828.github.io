Chapter 2626 - Disgrace

“But, Milord... that Chu Feng feels enormous hatred toward me. In the future, he will definitely find me, and I am no match for him.”

“If he is to find me, this lowly one will not be able to accomplish the mission that Milord has given me,” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster said.

“Are you threatening me?” The old man narrowed his eyebrows. Immediately, boundless killing intent filled the entire cave.

“No, this lowly one would not dare.” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster immediately kneeled onto the ground. He did not dare to raise his head again.

“Actually, in the battle at the Kong Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng’s Demon Armament was suppressed by a Demon Armament Suppression Talisman. As long as you obtain that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, you will be able to curb his Evil God Sword. With his abilities, how could he possibly contend against you then?” That old man said.

“Demon Armament Suppression Talisman? Where is that thing right now?” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster asked.

“It is in the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s possession,” The old man replied.

“That Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief has disappeared for a very long time now. Where should I go to find him?” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster revealed a difficult expression.

“Humph, truly slow-witted. Everything that occurs in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is in my eyes. While others might not know where that Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief might be, how could this old man not know?” That old man said.

“What Milord says is extremely correct. This lowly one was truly slow-witted,” After hearing those words, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster revealed a joyous expression.

However, he seemed to immediately recall something else. His expression changed slightly. Then, he asked, “Although this lowly one is slow-witted, I am still able to tell that the Demon Armament Chu Feng possessed is most definitely not an ordinary item. As such, how could the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief possess a treasure capable of curbing that Demon Armament?”

“He would naturally not be able to possess such a treasure. It is something given to him by a grand individual,” The old man said.

“Then, who is it that gave it to him?” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster asked.

“You are asking too many foolish questions,” After hearing those words, the old man was immediately furious. He shouted, “Since your injuries have been healed, why are you still here? Go and finish the task!”

After he finished saying those words, the old man tossed a stone toward the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

Written on the stone was the location where the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was currently hiding. Upon receiving the stone, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster respectfully bid his farewell to the old man and then left immediately. He proceeded to the location written on the stone.

He knew very well that he was only able to defeat Ying Mingchao because of that Incomplete Immortal Armament. As for that Incomplete Immortal Armament, it was given to him by the old man.

It was that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan who had bestowed upon him power surpassing everyone else in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, he also knew very well that his life was no longer his to control since the day that old man got in contact with him.

If he wanted to live, then he must do one thing. That is... he must obey every word from that old man.

After the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster left, the old man did not immediately leave.

Instead, he looked into the distance and softly muttered, “Ever since Chu Feng entered the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm has become completely different. Those that originally did not meddle with things in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm all started to involve themselves because of that Chu Feng.”

“But... exactly who is it that gave them the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman? Originally, I thought he was someone with a conflict against Chu Feng, and that he would eliminate Chu Feng. However, he evidently did not do that.”

“Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, exactly what is your origin? Could it be that you really are his descendant?”

Thinking about that, the old man started to tightly clench his fists that were within his sleeves.

Although he was tasked with monitoring the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, there were many things that he possessed no knowledge of.

This was especially true in regards to the many secrets concerning Chu Feng. Even now, he had no answer to them.

That was precisely the reason why he became furious when the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster asked about the origin of the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.

The reason for that was because he did not know who the owner of that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman was. This made him feel a sense of failure.

Even though he should be an existence akin to a god in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he was unable to control everything like a god.

The old man let out a soft sigh. However, he still didn’t leave. He seemed to be waiting for something.

“Senior.”

After roughly six hours passed, the middle-aged man from the Chu Heavenly Clan flew over from afar. He landed before the old man and bowed respectfully to him.

“You’ve returned. How is Chu Feng?” That old man asked.

“Senior, Chu Feng has been taken away by that young woman called Li Yue’er. Although he has suffered from the pain brought forth by his backlash, there should be no danger to his life.”

“As for that Li Yue’er, she should be previously known as Young Master Li Ming. I truly never expected... that she actually hid herself this well.”

“However, Chu Feng clearly knew that Young Master Li Ming was actually a female. I wonder... did he come to know it when he was at Mount Cloud Crane, or was it from elsewhere?”

“This junior was truly negligent. I have failed to maintain my absolute surveillance on him,” When the middle-aged man said those words, he revealed an ashamed expression.

“This cannot be blamed on you. It is orders from above that transferred away too many of our clansmen in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As we lack the manpower, we are unable to monitor things to a satisfactory degree. It is all within reason,” The old man said.

After saying that, the old man asked, “Have all of our clan’s younger generation that were sent to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm left?”

“Senior, please rest assured. They have all left. After all, our clan has already canceled all missions in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Without any mission, they will naturally not stay in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” The middle-aged man said.

“It is for the best that they’ve left. We have no idea what sort of shenanigans the Infant Soul Sect is planning to get up to this time around. We must not allow our clan’s younger generation to get involved in this matter. Else... according to our clan’s rules, even if they are to encounter danger, we must absolutely not act to save them,” The old man said.

“Senior, we are not allowed to save them because they were tasked with missions. Now that all the missions are canceled, they are no longer tempering themselves in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Are we still not allowed to save them should something happen to them in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?” The middle-aged man asked.

“Who said that all the missions were canceled? Isn’t the mission of eliminating the Infant Soul Sect still present?” The old man said.

“......” Hearing those words, the expression of the middle-aged man changed. He looked to his left hand. On his wrist was a visible scar. It was a scar that he had from his palm being chopped off before.

Seeing that scar, the middle-aged man’s tone became complicated, “The mission to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect is too difficult. Likely, apart from our clan’s several heavenly beloved geniuses, no one will be able to accomplish it.”

“I feel that the mission that should be canceled the most is that mission.”

“Chu Huai, actually, the mission that you do not wish to be canceled the most is the mission to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect, no?”

“Actually, you, more than anyone else, want a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation to be able to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect. Isn’t that right?” The old man said with a faint smile on his face.

The middle-aged man did not refute him.

“Actually, with your talent, you are more than capable of attaining accomplishments in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. There was no need for you to apply to come to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to monitor it, no?” The old man said.

“I was incompetent. I failed to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect within the age limit. Instead, I received the humiliation of a blade.”

“However, I still hope that someone from our clan will be able to help me obtain revenge for my humiliation,” That man by the name of Chu Huai said.

The old man sighed. “You are still young, you must let go of what you should let go. Do not let this matter linger in your heart the entire time, for it will not bring you any benefit,” As the old man spoke, he faced his palm toward Chu Huai’s wrist and gently swiped it across the air before him.

Then, a layer of spirit power entered Chu Huai’s wrist and completely removed the scar on his wrist.

The old man knew very well that with Chu Huai’s strength, he was more than capable of eliminating that scar by himself. He had deliberately left that scar on his wrist.

The old man knew that Chu Huai had left that scar to remind himself that he had been defeated in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, that he had been defeated by the Infant Soul Sect.

He was trying to use that scar to urge himself to become stronger.

However, to someone as proud as Chu Huai, that scar did not become a motivation to become more powerful. Instead, it became an imprint in his heart that he was unable to erase.

As for that imprint, it was something called disgrace.
