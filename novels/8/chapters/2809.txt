Chapter 2809 - Crafty Plots

“Heh...”

At the moment when the crowd were astonished by the extraordinary might of the Ancient Era’s War Sword and the Ancient Era’s War Axe, Han Yu let out a sneer.

“These are your trump cards?”

After he finished saying those words, Han Yu shook his head. He said, “If that’s all you have, then you’ve already lost this battle.”

Once Han Yu said those words, the crowd were immediately astonished. The reason for that was because Han Yu’s confidence was very real. It was as if he had truly managed to see through everything, managed to tell that victory was already within his grasp.

“You’re quite confident,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Seems like you still don’t believe me,” Han Yu also smiled. It was an extremely mocking smile. It was as if he was certain of being able to defeat Chu Feng.

“How about this, you go ahead and attack me first. Use all of your abilities to attack me. If you are able to force me to reveal my Incomplete Immortal Armament, I will consider this match my loss,” Han Yu said.

“How could this Han Yu be this confident? Is he underestimating his enemy, or is he truly certain that he will definitely win?”

While the people from the older generations were fine, those from the younger generations were starting to ponder as to how come Han Yu was so confident.

Without a doubt, Han Yu was very powerful. However, they’d heard of Chu Feng’s strength before too.

If the two of them were to fight with one another, most of the crowd felt that they would be evenly matched.

As such, how could Han Yu be so confident? How could he be so certain that he’d defeat Chu Feng?

“That’s only what you say.”

Chu Feng actually did not refuse Han Yu’s arrogant claim.

Chu Feng felt that this was a great opportunity for him, and a road to disaster for Han Yu.

At that moment, Chu Feng also did not have a hundred percent certainty in being able to defeat Han Yu. However, Chu Feng was confident that he would be able to force Han Yu to use his Incomplete Immortal Armament.

“I, Han Yu, always honor my words. I will declare once again. Today, if I, Han Yu, am to use my Incomplete Immortal Armament to increase my battle power while fighting against you, Chu Feng, then I will lose this battle,” Han Yu said.

“Very well.”

As Chu Feng spoke, with a mere thought, the Ancient Era’s War Sword landed on his body. It shone brightly and majestically with golden light. Like a guardian, it protected Chu Feng within it.

As for the Ancient Era’s War Axe, it turned into a murdering god. With unparalleled might, it moved to attack Han Yu.

“Humph,” seeing Chu Feng’s incoming attack, Han Yu sneered. Then, his palms moved in succession as he unleashed several different attacks.

His attacks were all martial skills.

They ranged from rank one martial skills to rank nine martial skills to taboo martial skills. They were all being unleashed in succession.

He was... planning to probe the strength of Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe.

The many martial skills began to collide with Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe in succession. Energy ripples surged about, and soon, the result of the confrontation became apparent.

Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe was stopped by Han Yu’s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.

When Han Yu used an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill, Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe was actually beaten back.

“Han Yu is amazing.”

At that moment, the expressions of the crowd changed enormously.

As the saying goes, the difference in one’s talent would determine the difference in the might of one’s martial skill.

With his actions, Han Yu had demonstrated this point before everyone.

Merely by using an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill, Han Yu actually managed to beat back Chu Feng’s heaven-defying secret skill.

“Chu Feng, it’s my turn to attack now.”

Upon seeing that his Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill was capable of pushing back Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe, Han Yu unleashed ten Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills in succession.

The ten Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills were shot forth repeatedly. From their attacks, Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe was beaten back bit by bit.

“The disparity between Chu Feng and Han Yu is actually this wide?”

“Could it be that even a genius like Chu Feng will not be able to contend against Han Yu?”

“Is this the strength of someone on the Demon-level Geniuses List?”

Many people felt surprised at how quickly Chu Feng entered a disadvantaged state in the battle.

They had originally felt that Chu Feng and Han Yu were equally matched. Yet, at the moment, it would appear that it wasn’t the case at all.

After all, Chu Feng had unleashed his Incomplete Immortal Armament from the very start, whereas Han Yu had yet to use his.

Yet, even under such conditions, Chu Feng was actually suppressed by Han Yu, without the ability to retaliate at all. The disparity between them was completely evident.

Furthermore, they felt that Chu Feng was most definitely not deliberately holding back. Rather, it was that Han Yu was simply too powerful for Chu Feng.

“Damn it.”

At that moment, Chu Feng started to frown. A difficult expression filled his face. It was as if he was soon to crumble from Han Yu’s attacks.

Shortly afterward, Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe was no longer able to continue on with its attack. Instead, it instead started defending against Han Yu’s attacks.

Chu Feng brought the Ancient Era’s War Axe back beside him. Together with the Ancient Era’s War Sword, they firmly protected Chu Feng within them.

When the Ancient Era’s War Sword and the Ancient Era’s War Axe joined together, the situation of the battle finally took a slight turn for the better.

At the very least, Han Yu’s Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills were no longer capable of beating Chu Feng back. After Chu Feng focused wholly on defense, he was no longer in as sorry of a state as before.

However, Han Yu did not give up just like that. He seemed to be determined, and wanted to defeat Chu Feng quickly, quickly settle the match.

Thus, he clasped his palms together. Then, his body started to emit white gaseous flames. The white gaseous flames were changing faintly. Soon, they turned into a sharp white sword. The sharp sword was floating above Han Yu’s head.

That sharp sword was three thousand meters in length. It covered the sky and hid the earth. It was truly enormous.

Compared to the enormous sword above him, Han Yu was akin to an ant. However, the most frightening thing regarding that enormous white sword was most definitely not its massive body. Rather, it was the aura that it was emitting.

The enormous white sword... was an Immortal Technique. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s the Immortal Technique: Enormous Floating Sword!”

“That is Han Yu’s famed Immortal Technique. That is the Immortal Technique that Han Yu used to defeat countless geniuses in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition!”

Upon seeing the enormous sword, many people began to worry for Chu Feng. After all, an Immortal Technique was not something that Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills could compare to.

“Boom~~~”

A loud explosion was heard as a white light streaked across the sky. The next moment, the enormous white sword collided with the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

“Rumble~~~”

In an instant, waves of rumbling were heard. It was akin to ten thousand thunders.

White energy ripples began to wreak havoc all over. The younger generations present were so scared that they hurriedly hid themselves behind the older generations.

The reason for that was because those energy ripples were simply too powerful. If they were stuck by those energy ripples, they would likely be shattered to pieces.

“This...”

When the energy ripples gradually vanished, the crowd’s worry for Chu Feng lessened by quite a bit.

The reason for that was because an Immortal Technique could only be used once within a certain period of time. Furthermore, the Immortal Technique would either defeat one’s opponent or gradually vanish.

That said, after Han Yu’s Immortal Technique struck, Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe and Ancient Era’s War Sword appeared to be completely undamaged.

That being said, the crowd did not feel that Chu Feng would have any chance of defeating Han Yu.

Even though the Ancient Era’s War Sword and Ancient Era’s War Axe were undamaged, there was a line of blood at the corner of Chu Feng’s mouth. Fresh blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.

This meant that an enormous burden had been placed on Chu Feng. Likely, he would not be able to continue to withstand many more attacks.

That being said, at the moment when the great majority of the people from the younger generation felt that Chu Feng would be defeated, Chu Lingxi had a profound smile on her face.

As for Xia Yun’er, anger appeared in her eyes.

She had fought against Chu Feng before. Thus, she knew very well that Chu Feng was not so weak.

Thus, when she saw that Chu Feng was seemingly about to collapse, she involuntarily started frowning.

She thought to herself, ‘This treacherous bastard. He’s plotting something again.’
