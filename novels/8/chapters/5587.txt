Chapter 5587: Promise with Little Fishy

Chu Feng wasn’t bothered by the Seven Realms Edict despite the commotion it had kicked up since he wasn’t planning to participate in the examination anyway. Instead, he brought Little Fishy to a realm in the Heavenly Dome Galaxy’s Combat Starfield.

“Little Fishy, how much do you know about the Fighting Ape Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

He had finally remembered the Fighting Ape Clan. When he first arrived at the Heavenly Chu Clan, he approached many people in order to better understand his father’s background. It was during that period of time that he managed to gather some information about Old Ape.

None of the Heavenly Chu Clansmen knew much about Old Ape as it was a companion whom his father had met along the way, but Old Ape had once told him that it was from the Fighting Ape Clan.

While the Chu Heavenly Clan was the overlord of an Upper Realm, they were just frogs in a well. They didn’t even know the history of the fallen Ancestral Martial Galaxy, let alone the Fighting Ape Clan. They had simply thought the Fighting Ape Clan was a powerful monstrous beast clan based on Old Ape’s strength, but that was all to their speculation.

Even now, Chu Feng still didn’t know much about the Fighting Ape Clan.

“I don’t know much, but I have heard about them. The Fighting Ape Clan denizens are monstrous beasts shaped like apes. They are domineering and fiercely loyal. Even though they are monstrous beasts, they embrace the spirit of heroism. They are very strong and have friends all around the world, such that there was even a point in time when it looked like they would conquer a galaxy. However, they suddenly disappeared shortly after they came to fame in the earlier years of the current era,” Little Fishy said.

“The Fighting Ape Clan has disappeared too?” Chu Feng frowned.

He couldn’t help but notice that many powerhouses had disappeared in the earlier years of the current era, but this didn’t make sense. If the Fighting Ape Clan had disappeared in the earlier years of the era, how did Old Ape even meet his father?

There were only two possibilities here.

One, the Fighting Ape Clan was still alive and well in this world, just that they had chosen to go undercover.

Two, Old Ape was lying about its identity as a Fighting Ape Clansman.

Chu Feng thought that the first possibility was much more likely.

“Many powers have vanished in the earlier years of the current era, but it’s speculated that they have entered the Immemorial Domain of Gods. I told you earlier there have been no Heavenly God level cultivators or Heavenly Dragon World Spiritists in the world of cultivation.

“There is a theory that the world of cultivation was rich in natural energies in the earlier years of the current era, but the natural energies dwindled later. Many speculated that the Immemorial Domain of Gods might contain more natural energies, so many experts chose to enter it so that they can surpass themselves. There are even entire powers who chose to move into the Immemorial Domain of Gods.

“In fact, the major powers in that era even sent their people to investigate the Immemorial Domain of Gods, just that none of those who have entered the Immemorial Domain of Gods have returned.

“There were rumors that those who entered the Immemorial Domain of Gods enjoyed such huge growth in their cultivation that they are not willing to return, though there are also those who think that it’s impossible for everyone to enter the Immemorial Domain of Gods to not want to return, no matter how good its conditions are. After all, they still have family members and friends in the world of cultivation.

“Thus came the second theory that they couldn’t return at all, but why would those who have entered the Immemorial Domain of Gods be unable to return? The most common deduction was that those who had entered the Ninth Galaxy were all dead, which led to the Ninth Galaxy being dubbed the Immemorial Purgatory. Many people became so afraid of that place that they would rather die than head there,” Little Fishy said.

“Do you think that the Ninth Galaxy is the Immemorial Domain of Gods or the Immemorial Purgatory?” Chu Feng asked.

“I do think that the Immemorial Domain of Gods is a good place, but I doubt that it is so good that those who enter it are unwilling to return. After all, the major powers dispatched their most loyal clansmen there to investigate the place; it didn’t make sense for all of them to not return. I reckon that there is a special seal on the Immemorial Domain of Gods that prevents those in there from leaving its premises. What do you think, big brother?” Little Fishy asked.

“I think that your analysis makes sense,” Chu Feng said.

“Hehe! Actually, most people, including my father and my big brother, think that,” Little Fishy said with a chuckle.

“Do you intend to enter the Immemorial Domain of Gods in the future?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, I’ll definitely make my way to the Immemorial Domain of Gods, but there’s something I need to do before then,” Little Fishy said.

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ll first lead my Immortal Sea Fish Clan to the top of the world of cultivation,” Little Fishy said.

“Isn’t the Immortal Sea Fish Clan already standing at the top of the world of cultivation?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s not what I mean. I want to make the Immortal Sea Fish Clan the strongest powerhouse, not just one of the strongest powerhouses,” Little Fishy said.

“Oh? I can’t tell that you actually harbor such ambitions,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.

Such words were only a dream to most people, but Little Fishy had the power to pull it off. As long as she was given ample time, she most definitely had the means to bring the Immortal Sea Fish Clan to the very peak of the world of cultivation.

Chu Feng didn’t think that the young Little Fishy would harbor such serious thoughts.

“Big brother, you know why the present era is known as God’s Era, right?” Little Fishy asked.

“I have heard,” Chu Feng replied.

“This is a rare opportunity. Anyone can be crowned king in any era, but only those who are crowned king in God’s Era will be remembered by all. I, Xianhai Yu’er, want to be the king of this era!” Little Fishy said with an intoxicatingly sweet smile.

Chu Feng belatedly realized that Little Fishy was filled with ambition and fighting will too, and he was very fond of this side of her.

Nevertheless, he couldn’t help but interject, “Don’t you mean conferred god?”

“Eesh! I think that ‘crowned king’ sounds much better,” Little Fishy protested.

“All right,” Chu Feng replied with a cheeky smile.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Big brother, will you go easy on me if we ever cross blows for our clans’ honor?” Little Fishy suddenly asked.

“Cross blows for our clans’ honor?”

“Yes.”

“You can be certain that I won’t go easy on you.”

“Wonderful! That’s what I’m thinking too!” Little Fishy’s smile grew even more vibrant.

“What about you?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ll also give it my all. That’s the greatest respect I can show you, big brother,” Little Fishy said as she cheekily shook her little fist.

“Just make sure that you don’t beat me to death, all right?” Chu Feng teased.

“What are you saying, big brother? I wouldn’t be that vicious as to take your life. You must do the same too, all right! Ah, you should avoid hitting my face too. Even if I suffer a loss, I still want to look beautiful in front of big brother,” Little Fishy said.

“Of course,” Chu Feng replied.

“It’s a deal then!” Little Fishy said.

“Mmhm.” Chu Feng nodded.
