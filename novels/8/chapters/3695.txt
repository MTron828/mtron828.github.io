Chapter 3695 - Special Training Method

“This place is simply too amazing.”

“Never would I have expected our Chu Heavenly Clan to possess such an outstanding sacred cultivation ground.”

“If I spend a year training in this place, my cultivation will definitely reach rank five Exalted.”

Compared to Chu Feng, who was thinking in his heart, Chu Lingxi was shouting excitedly. Sure enough, she had sensed the same thing as him.

“Rank five Exalted in a year?”

“Lingxi, you really think that you will be able to make two successive breakthroughs in cultivation by training in here for a year?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After Chu Lingxi’s words were heard by Chu Xuanzhengfa, he was unable to keep his calm.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was about the same age as Chu Xuanyuan. He had trained bitterly for so many years in order to become an Exalted.

He knew very well how difficult it was to increase one’s cultivation upon reaching the Exalted realm.

Although he felt astonished by Chu Lingxi reaching rank three Exalted in such a short period of time, the blood of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan flowed through Chu Lingxi’s body.

On top of that, Chu Lingxi’s mother Gu Mingyuan had left a seed in Chu Lingxi’s body the moment she was born.

Thus, he felt that she was able to advance by leaps and bounds because she was able to harvest what had been prepared for her by her mother. That was something that he was capable of accepting.

However, after Chu Lingxi declared that she would be able to break through to rank five Exalted within a year of training there, Chu Xuanzhengfa was still astonished.

After all, both he and many elders of the Chu Heavenly Clan had trained in there. Thus, he knew that that place was a scared cultivation ground, and had sensed the power mentioned by Chu Lingxi too.

Because of that, he was unable to help but ponder if the disparity between people’s talents was truly that enormous?

No matter what, he was deemed to be a genius too.

In fact, it could even be said that he was someone with exceptional talent amongst the people of his generation, and beneath only Chu Xuanyuan.

“Father, haven’t you spent some time training in this place yourself? Did you not sense the opportunity to make a breakthrough whilst in here?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“I’ve gained comprehension here. However, I am far from sensing the opportunity to reach a breakthrough,” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“That’s strange. You’re only a rank one Exalted. You should’ve sensed the opportunity to make a breakthrough already after training here for so long.”

Chu Lingxi frowned. It was clear that she didn’t understand why her father hadn’t managed to make a breakthrough yet.

This caused Chu Xuanzhengfa to feel rather embarrassed.

“Perhaps this is the disparity between talents. Even if I do not wish to admit this disparity, I have no choice but to admit it,” Chu Xuanzhengfa forced a smile on his face.

Suddenly, Chu Feng said, “Senior, it might be possible that your training method is incorrect.”

“Use this method and try to comprehend your surroundings again.”

Then, Chu Feng taught Chu Xuanzhengfa a special method to sense the natural energies of that place.

This training method was very unique. It was not a training method where one simply used one’s mysterious technique to train. More than that, it was a method that relied on the mobilization of one’s Bloodline’s Power.

Chu Xuanzhengfa ended up using the method Chu Feng taught him to comprehend the natural energies there.

Once he did that, a marvelous expression soon filled his face.

“This sensation is simply... unbelievable. So... it was my training method that was wrong?”

Chu Xuanzhengfa became endlessly excited. He was so excited that he seemed to be on the verge of jumping around.

After comprehending the surrounding natural energies according to the training method taught to him by Chu Feng, he discovered that the natural energies not only became even richer, but even the martial comprehension grew much clearer.

After using the training method, he felt as if he was in a completely different cultivation formation.

“It seems that senior’s previous training method was indeed incorrect,” said Chu Feng.

“Heavens. Chu Feng, you are truly a genius. It’s no wonder your cultivation speed is so fast. Your comprehension is simply not something that I can compare to.”

“Today, I am truly convinced.”

Chu Xuanzhengfa was extremely joyous, and began to praise Chu Feng repeatedly. He was so excited that he was gesticulating with joy, and had lost the composure of a senior.

He seemed like he would even go up to Chu Feng and give him a kiss.

That said, upon thinking about it, his current behavior was understandable too.

As a martial cultivator, who wouldn’t want their cultivation to become stronger?

Chu Xuanzhengfa knew that if he trained according to the method taught to him by Chu Feng, his cultivation would be able to advance by leaps and bounds after training in the Bloodline Cultivation Formation.

Even though he was not as confident as Chu Lingxi at being able to reach rank five Exalted in a year, he felt that it would not be a problem for him to reach rank two Exalted within a year.

If he could reach rank two Exalted within a year, what would happen if he trained for ten years, or a hundred years?

He felt that it would even be possible for him to reach the Utmost Exalted realm in the future.

Before, he had never dared think about becoming an Utmost Exalted.

The reason why he gained such confidence was not only because of the power of the Bloodline Cultivation Formation, but also because of the training method taught to him by Chu Feng.

To Chu Feng, it was a simple training method.

However, to Chu Xuanzhengfa, it was an enormous grace.

“Father, is Chu Feng’s training method really that effective? How come I don’t feel much of a difference after trying it out?”

Seeing how excited her father was, Chu Lingxi attempted Chu Feng’s training method too.

However, the result of her test was as she had stated. It did not produce much of an effect for her.

Thus, she was skeptical of her father’s exaggerated behavior.
