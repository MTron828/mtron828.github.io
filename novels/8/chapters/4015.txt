Chapter 4015 - I’ll Kill All Of You

“Wind Lightning Sword Sect, Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain, you dare to torture my brother like this?! I’ll exterminate your powers completely!”

Seeing Chu Feng’s miserable appearance, the Mystic Cave Saints shivered with rage.

Even though they were already extremely weak themselves, they were screaming rage-filled insults at the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster.

“Humph, you’d best not think you’ll have it easy.”

Unfortunately, their insults reminded the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster that they were there.

As such, he took out another eleven Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs and inserted them into the Mystic Cave Saints’ mouths.

Once the poisonous bugs entered their bodies, the appearances of the eleven men immediately grew twisted. They began to scream in misery and pain. Their screams were even many times more miserable than Chu Feng’s.

However, only a single Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bug had been placed in their bodies.

Chu Feng, on the other hand, had received three.

With the situation being like that, some of the more experienced people from the older generation started feeling admiration for Chu Feng.

They knew that even though the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs would not kill their victims, that was only if the victim was suffering from the torture of a single Nine Star Corpse-devouring Bug.

If the number of bugs were increased, the pain and suffering would also increase. Naturally, the threat of death would also arrive.

Three Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs was a number capable of causing death.

That was why they felt admiration for Chu Feng’s perseverance. If he didn’t possess outstanding willpower, those three Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs would’ve long since caused him to have a nervous breakdown.

However, he was still enduring.

Of course, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster were not standing idly by whilst all this was happening.

They began to search Chu Feng’s body. They wanted to find the mysterious treasure he had taken. They even took the Cosmos Sack at his waist.

However, after the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster searched Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack, he started to frown. Even his expression distorted. The Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster also realized that the situation was bad.

However, since this concerned the mysterious treasure, he asked, “Did you discover anything?”

“Look for yourself.”

With a gloomy look on his face, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster tossed Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack to the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster.

Once the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster received the Cosmos Sack, he immediately opened it.

However, once he opened the Cosmos Sack, he immediately started gnashing his teeth angrily.

Not to mention a mysterious treasure, there was simply nothing of value in Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack.

Rather, an overwhelming stench assaulted his nostrils. The contents of Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack were simply disgusting to the extreme.

That was no Cosmos Sack for treasures at all. It was simply a trap. It was a trap for the people who wanted to plunder Chu Feng’s treasures.

Having failed to find any treasures, and instead having been played for fools by Chu Feng, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster and the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster became even more furious.

They were so angry that they wanted to hack Chu Feng into eight pieces.

“Still refusing to talk?”

“Very good. Very good. I shall see exactly how tight-lipped you are.”

In a raging temper, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster took out six more Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs.

“Have you gone mad?”

Seeing that, even the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster’s expression changed. He hurriedly spoke to stop him.

He was worried not because of how cruel the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster was.

If they could make Chu Feng talk, he wouldn’t care if they had to kill Chu Feng in the process.

In fact, he never planned to allow Chu Feng to leave alive. Even if Chu Feng decided to hand them the mysterious treasure, he would still kill him.

He knew very well that he absolutely could not allow a genius of such caliber to remain alive, or he would definitely be a source of future worries.

However, Chu Feng had yet to hand over the mysterious treasure. If they were to execute him, they would be the ones to suffer enormously.

To ordinary people, three Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs was already a limit. If six more bugs were added to the number, it would definitely be fatal.

“Rest assured, I know what to do.”

“This little bastard is extremely tough. He won’t die. However... once I put these six bugs into him, he will definitely start begging me to kill him.”

After saying those words, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster placed all six Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs into Chu Feng.

“Eeeaahhh~~~”

Sure enough, once the six Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs were inserted into Chu Feng’s body, even his screams changed.

The crowd all felt that the poison of the nine Corpse-devouring Bugs was too strong, and had caused even Chu Feng’s voice to change.

However, when Zhao Hong heard that voice, her expression suddenly changed.

There were dozens of strange rods impaling Zhao Hong’s body. Each rod brought her a different kind of injury.

Even though she was not screaming miserably like Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints, the torture she received from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was actually not inferior to that of the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs.

Originally, Zhao Hong was extremely weak and powerless to even open her eyes. She was on the verge of losing consciousness, and felt that she would fall into an endless abyss and be enveloped by endless pain and suffering that would ultimately result in her death.

However, hearing Chu Feng’s screams, she opened her eyes. As she stared at Chu Feng, she appeared to have changed completely.

Even the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted felt scared upon seeing Zhao Hong like that.

Her reaction had surpassed common sense.

He thought that his torture was ineffective.

Only Zhao Hong herself knew why she has reacted that way.

The reason why Chu Feng’s voice changed was because his consciousness was starting to crumble from the torture of the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs. With that, he was no longer able to alter his voice.

As such, he started screaming with his actual voice.

In other words, the voice Chu Feng was screaming with was the voice of Chu Feng, and not Asura. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Whilst the bystanders failed to take notice, Zhao Hong fully noticed Chu Feng’s voice.

“So it’s you!”

Zhao Hong stared at Chu Feng. Glistening teardrops actually appeared in her deep-red eyes.

She had not shed a single tear whilst being tortured miserably by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

Yet at that moment, she was actually unable to contain herself. After the glistening teardrops appeared, they began to roll down the corners of her eyes nonstop.

She’d finally understood why that Asura fellow would suddenly appear to help her.

Realizing everything, her body began to shiver. Her trembling had nothing to do with her injuries.

An enormous change had started to occurr within her body.

Although she was suffering from serious injuries, she was reacting as if she had forgotten all about her pain. Her eyes became terrifying, and her expression ice-cold.

She slowly began to stand up from a position of lying powerlessly in midair.

“This girl...”

“Could she have...”

Seeing Zhao Hong acting that way, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s gaze changed. He seemed to have realized something, as fear actually appeared in his eyes.

Terrified, he even took steps back repeatedly.

Suddenly, Zhao Hong let out a furious shout.

“I’ll kill all of you!”

Her shout contained overflowing killing intent that engulfed the surroundings.
