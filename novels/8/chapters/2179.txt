Chapter 2179 - Retarded Sex Fiend

At that moment, Chu Feng had already brought Tang Ying to a place far from the Cao Family. Not only did he prepare sufficient travel expenses for Tang Ying, he had also used his world spirit techniques to help her alter her appearance.

Unless one was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it would simply be impossible for anyone to see through Tang Ying’s altered appearance.

“From today on, your name can remain Ying. However, your full name cannot be Tang Ying, understand?”

“Furthermore, I can only bring you here. You will have to travel the rest of your journey yourself. Get as far away from here as you can and do not return here,” Chu Feng instructed Tang Ying.

“Chu Feng, will we be able to meet again in the future?” Tang Ying asked.

“If fate wills it, we will definitely meet again,” Chu Feng said.

“In that case, will you eliminate all the people of our Tang Family?” Tang Ying asked.

“It would be best that you do not ask about this matter. I fear that the answer will make you feel uncomfortable,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing those words, Tang Ying grew silent. She knew that Chu Feng would definitely not spare the people of the Tang Family.

Even though the people from the Tang Family had betrayed her, it remained that they were her relatives. The affection of many years was not something that could be erased so easily.

Upon thinking that her father and old brothers would all be killed, she felt very pained and reluctant.

However, she did not know how she could persuade Chu Feng to spare them. After all, the Tang Family had indeed wronged Chu Feng enormously.

Furthermore, she owed Chu Feng enormously.

“No matter what, I must still thank you,” Tang Ying said to Chu Feng.

“Stop acting this foolishly. In the future, you must make sure to not believe people that easily. Remember, you must take care of yourself,” Chu Feng said to Tang Ying with a smile.

“Mn,” Tang Ying nodded.

“Go on, I’ll see you off from afar,” Chu Feng said.

Tang Ying smiled sweetly. She did not wish for Chu Feng to see a sad expression on her during their separation; she wished to leave behind a good impression for Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because she knew that this separation might be a separation of a lifetime.

Tang Ying walked away. Gradually, she disappeared from Chu Feng’s line of sight.

As for Chu Feng, he felt even more sadness in his heart. In one’s life, one would meet many people that would end up separating. Tang Ying was one such person for him.

However, he wished that Tang Ying would be able to live a better life in the future. The reason for that was because Chu Feng could imagine how painful it must be for her to be betrayed by the family that that she loved the most.

After silently looking at the direction in which Tang Ying had left for a very long time, Chu Feng turned around and began to proceed toward the direction of the Cao Family.

Tang Ying’s guess was correct, Chu Feng would spare neither the Tang Family nor the Cao Family.

Tomorrow, at the Alliance Ceremony held at the Cao Family, it would be the time for Chu Feng to dispense justice on the Tang and Cao Families.

............

The next day, the Alliance Ceremony between the Tang and the Cao Families began as scheduled. All of the people who were able to enter this place could be considered famous and powerful existences in the area.

Even though both the Tang Family and the Cao Family were actually unwilling to enter this alliance - the two families were, after all, killing one another not long ago, and both had suffered casualties in the process - they had to appear very merry, as there were this many guests, and even Luyang’s Pavilion’s Elder Yuan Zhen and many other experts present.

After seeing the merry appearance of the Tang and Cao Families, the guests that had arrived were all quite surprised. After all, they had heard that the Tang and Cao Families were at each other’s throats not long ago.

Originally, many people were skeptical when they heard the news that the Tang and Cao Families would be allying with one another. They had come here with doubt in their hearts. However, to their surprise, the Tang and Cao Families were actually really going to become allies.

Even though they had questions in their hearts, it remained that people from Luyang’s Pavilion were present. As such, the guests did not raise any mood-dampening questions. Instead, they all pretended to be very happy.

With this being the case, this Alliance Ceremony naturally became even livelier. It had reached what the Tang and Cao Families had hoped for.

During the lively excitement, no one noticed that an uninvited guest had infiltrated this Alliance Ceremony. This person was naturally the person that the Tang and Cao Families were secretly searching for, Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had been surveying the strength of the people from Luyang’s Pavilion the entire time.

The reason why Chu Feng was only surveying the strength of the people from Luyang’s Pavilion was because he was already capable of ignoring the Tang and Cao Families’ forces.

The reason for that was because even their strongest Family Heads would not be a match for Chu Feng now.

Chu Feng also did not place that Elder Yuan Zhen in his eyes. Between those with the same battle power, Chu Feng did not fear anyone.

However, Chu Feng knew that the power of Luyang’s Pavilion was most definitely not limited to this. Although Elder Yuan Zhen’s status might be high in Luyang’s Pavilion, his strength was definitely not overly strong.

Thus, Chu Feng was focused on surveying the others from Luyang’s Pavilion. After surveying the others from Luyang’s Pavilion, Chu Feng felt relief.

The reason for that was because of the people from Luyang’s Pavilion that had come to this Alliance Ceremony, the strongest person was actually Elder Yuan Zhen. The others were weaker than even Yuan Zhen. As such, Chu Feng would naturally not have to be afraid of them.

However, even after he determined that the people present in the Alliance Ceremony would pose no threat to him, Chu Feng did not act immediately. The reason for that was because he wanted to enjoy a great show first.

As for that, it would be the scene of the Cao Family’s Family Head’s Sixth Madam being married to the Cao Family’s youngest son.

From Tang Ying, Chu Feng came to find out that even though the Cao Family’s youngest son was retarded, he was extremely perverted, and had defiled many women.

In fact, even many children had ended up being captured by his vile hands. Most disgustingly, he would even defile boys who were young and tender-looking.

Furthermore, many of the children were killed by him from the rape due to being too young. He was most definitely an animal.

As for that animal’s mother, that so-called Sixth Madam, she was not a good person either.

Originally, the person the Cao Family’s Family Head had grown fond of was actually the Sixth Madam’s twin sister. However, for the sake of position and wealth, the Sixth Madam had personally caused the death of her twin sister.

The Cao Family’s Family Head also knew about this matter. However, it remained that the dead could not be brought back to life. Furthermore, the Sixth Madam’s appearance was exactly the same as her twin sister’s. Thus, not only did the Cao Family’s Family Head not kill her, he instead took her as his wife.

After the Sixth Madam married into the Cao Family, she immediately started to incite trouble. Any servant she was not fond of was killed by her immediately. She was extremely cruel.

Thus, Chu Feng did not feel any sense of guilt when doing such a thing to that mother and son. Instead, he felt that it was what they deserved. After all, he felt that what he schemed could be said to be helping the heavens do a good deed.

Moreover, his actions would completely disgrace the Cao Family, and also humiliate the Tang Family. As such, this could be said to be killing three birds with one arrow.

The Alliance Ceremony continued without a hitch. It was merely a ceremony that caused one to feel sleepy.

After the Alliance Ceremony ended, Chu Feng’s highlight of the day, the marriage between Tang Ying and the Cao Family’s youngest son, finally appeared on stage.

When Cao Yu appeared on stage, many people wanted to laugh. That fellow was extremely ugly. It was as if he was soft in the head. His mouth was crooked, and his eyes were slanted. Furthermore, saliva was dripping from his mouth nonstop. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

His appearance resembled neither the Cao Family’s Family Head nor his mother.

However, if that was all there was to it, the crowd would not have wanted to laugh. Most importantly, he was being helped up to the stage by two servant girls.

Furthermore, as he walked, his eyes were fixed onto the servant girls’ chests nonstop. The more he looked, the more saliva he began to drool. His pervertedness was extremely obvious.

Seeing Cao Yu acting like this, the rumors of his outrageous lust were verified. When thinking of a retard that lacked intelligence and did not even know who his parents and siblings were, yet would have such lust and think about doing perverted things all day, how could one not feel the urge to laugh?
