Chapter 2639 - Astonishing Battle Power

“You damned stutterer! This Sectmaster has yet to unleash my full strength. Don’t you continue to act this pleased here!”

“Right now, this Sectmaster shall have you experience my true strength!”

Finally, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was unable to tolerate Wang Qiang’s insults, and returned Wang Qiang insults.

Furthermore, as he said those words, boundless dark black gaseous flames began to surge outward from his body into the sky.

Immediately, the vast sky was covered by the dark black gaseous flames. The infant cries also began to fill their surroundings.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster had unleashed his Infant Soul Demonic Technique, his technique that could contend against Divine Power.

“Die!!!”

After increasing his strength, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster immediately unleashed an attack at Wang Qiang.

“Heeahh~~~”

Wang Qiang shouted loudly. Then, four different-colored gaseous flames emerged from his body.

At the same time, from the sky that was originally covered by the dark black gaseous flames emerged four fierce and malevolent-looking beasts.

Those four ferocious beasts were simply too frightening. The auras that they emitted were extremely ice-cold. Even though those four ferocious beasts were only images and did not even let out a single roar, their grandeur surpassed that of the black gaseous flames that filled the sky and shadowed the infant cries.

They were truly frightening.

At the moment when Wang Qiang unleashed his Divine Power, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s attack was about to reach him.

Logically, at such a close distance, Wang Qiang would not be able to dodge the attack.

However, Wang Qiang merely raised his hand, and the Vegetable Cutting Edge in his hand actually arrived before him with an unimaginable speed.

“Clank!” Not only did Wang Qiang’s Vegetable Cutting Edge manage to block the attack from the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, it even knocked the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster back.

“This...” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster only managed to stabilize himself in midair after being forced back several steps.

At that moment, astonishment filled his face. Logically, the attack earlier should have most definitely struck Wang Qiang.

However, not only did it not manage to land on Wang Qiang, but he himself was even knocked back by Wang Qiang. He felt this to be utterly unbelievable.

“S-Say, grandson, d-didn’t you s-say that y-you wanted y-your granddaddy I to w-witness your p-power? Why d-don’t you t-try doing th-that?” Wang Qiang mocked.

“Humph,” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was furious from the humiliation. After letting out a snort, he once again rushed forth to attack Wang Qiang.

However, regardless of whether he tried to fight Wang Qiang at close range or attack him from afar, all of his attacks were easily blocked by Wang Qiang. He was simply unable to injure Wang Qiang at all.

Instead, he was beaten back by Wang Qiang repeatedly.

He felt extremely humiliated by what was happening.

“It’s those strange things?!”

After gradually calming down, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster took note of the four strange gaseous flames on Wang Qiang.

Then he looked upward, and discovered the ferocious image of the four imposing beasts in the sky.

At that moment, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster started to frown. He discovered that the power that Wang Qiang was unleashing right now was actually even more frightening than his Infant Soul Demonic Technique.

“You’ve trained in a Forbidden Demonic Technique?” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster asked.

“D-D-De-Demonic Technique? Your g-granddaddy’s power is c-called Divine Power!” Wang Qiang mocked.

“Nonsense! That is Divine Power? How could a Divine Power’s aura be like this?” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster refused to accept Wang Qiang’s declaration.

He simply did not believe that the power Wang Qiang unleashed was Divine Power.

As he had trained in the Infant Soul Demonic Technique his whole life, he firmly believed that Wang Qiang’s power also originated from a Forbidden Demonic Technique.

The reason for that was because he felt that the aura of Wang Qiang’s power was much stronger than his own Infant Soul Demonic Technique in both its murderousness and its heinous nature.

“F-For you t-to have never f-felt this s-sort of aura before only m-means that y-you are i-ignorant and l-lacking in knowledge,” Wang Qiang said.

“Don’t you act this arrogant! Even if you’ve trained in a Forbidden Demonic Technique, I will still eliminate a scourge like you today!” With a flip of his wrist, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster tossed away the Ancestral Armament in his hand.

Both the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s Abbot and the Immortal Sword School’s Headmaster revealed a confused expression upon seeing that. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was not a match for Wang Qiang. Given that that was the case, if he were to throw away his Ancestral Armament, he would be even less of a match for Wang Qiang.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at the moment when they were having misgivings, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster revealed a golden dagger in his hand.

“This aura, could that be... an Incomplete Immortal Armament?”

It was only after they saw the weapon held by the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster that they came to a sudden realization.

Naturally, the golden dagger held by the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster would be the Incomplete Immortal Armament Dragonscale Dagger.

“Y-You’re f-finally re-revealing your final t-trump card? S-Sure enough, that Incomplete Immortal Ar-Armament possesses an e-extraordinary aura. H-However, y-your granddaddy is s-still going to kill you today.”

When the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster unleashed his Incomplete Immortal Armament, Wang Qiang finally revealed a serious expression.

The reason for that was because the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s battle power had indeed increased enormously when the Incomplete Immortal Armament appeared.

The current Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster now had the strength to make Wang Qiang take him seriously.

“C-Come. Let y-your g-granddaddy see exactly w-what sort of power your Incomplete Immortal Armament might have.”

As Wang Qiang became serious, he also became excited. Holding the Vegetable Cutting Edge, he actually took the initiative to rush to attack the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

He was impatient to experience the might of an Incomplete Immortal Armament.

“Humph, ignorant child, by the time you realize the strength of my Incomplete Immortal Armament, you will already be dead.”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster snorted coldly. Then, with the Dragonscale Dagger in hand, he rushed to confront Wang Qiang.

The two of them were thinking the same thing. They both wanted to kill their opponent using the most humiliating method.

Thus, neither of them used any martial skills. Instead, they decided to fight one another at close range using only their weapons.

One was an Ancestral Armament, whereas the other was an Incomplete Immortal Armament.

As the two fought, sparks scattered about and energy ripples started to wreak havoc.

To the crowd’s astonishment, the battle that should have been easily decided entered a stalemate.

Wang Qiang actually managed to contend against the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, who was using an Incomplete Immortal Armament, with a kitchen cleaver-like Ancestral Armament.

“Brother Wang Qiang is truly powerful.”

At that moment, even Ying Mingchao was unable to contain himself from praising Wang Qiang.

He knew very well that even though Wang Qiang’s Ancestral Armament was a top quality Ancestral Armament, it was simply unable to contend against that Incomplete Immortal Armament.

Furthermore, Ying Mingchao had fought against that Incomplete Immortal Armament before. Thus, he knew very well how powerful it was.

There was only one reason why Wang Qiang was able to fight on par with the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, who was using an Incomplete Immortal Armament, with only an Ancestral Armament. That is, Wang Qiang’s battle power was outstanding.

Wang Qiang was making up for the deficit in the strength of his weapon with his own battle power.

With how powerful Wang Qiang’s battle power was, how could one not be astonished by it?

“S-Say, g-grandson, that Incomplete Immortal A-Armament of y-yours is not that s-strong either. W-Why is it th-that you are still n-no match for your g-granddaddy ev-even after fighting for so long?”

“That Incomplete I-Immortal Armament of yours couldn’t p-possibly be a fake, right?”

Wang Qiang was blabbering nonstop as he fought against the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. Insults were being shot out from his mouth toward the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster incessantly.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was so furious that his face turned green. However, he didn’t say anything, and merely continued with his attacks against Wang Qiang. Each and every one of his attacks were fatal. From this, it could be seen how much he detested Wang Qiang.

Unfortunately, all of his attacks were blocked by Wang Qiang. He was simply unable to injure Wang Qiang at all.

This caused the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster to be even more furious. He was already using an Incomplete Immortal Armament. Thus, how could he not defeat an Ancestral Armament?

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Wang Qiang suddenly accelerated his attacks and caught the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster off-guard.

“Puu.” A line of blood splattered forth. The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was struck by Wang Qiang. His entire left shoulder was nearly severed.

Seeing such a scene, the expressions of the experts present all changed. They involuntarily opened their mouths in amazement.

Although the two fighters were both rank two True Immortals, Wang Qiang actually managed to injure the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, who was using an Incomplete Immortal Armament, with an Ancestral Armament.

“Impossible!”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster looked at the deep wound on his left shoulder. He was actually unwilling to believe it to be real.

He was truly unable to accept it.

After all, he had utilized the power of his Incomplete Immortal Armament, which had increased his overall battle power.

It was one thing for him to not be able to kill Wang Qiang even with all this. Yet, how could he possibly be injured by Wang Qiang?

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Wang Qiang unleashed a barrage of attacks at the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster with his Vegetable Cutting Edge.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster refused to accept his defeat, and rushed forth to meet Wang Qiang’s attacks.

However, he was defeated even more thoroughly the second time around. After a mere couple bouts, his entire body was riddled with wounds.

“Woosh~~~”

With the situation being like that, even though the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was unwilling to accept it, he had no choice but to admit that he was no match for Wang Qiang.

Thus, he moved back explosively and distanced himself from Wang Qiang.
