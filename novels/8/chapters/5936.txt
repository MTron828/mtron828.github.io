Chapter 5937: The Netherworld Sect’s Three Factions

“What are you saying, big brother Chu Feng? We are sectmembers. Why would I kill them if not for you?” Song Yun pouted in indignation.

Chu Feng reached out and grabbed Song Yun’s wrist. “You prepared the formation on your palm in advance.”

“I did, but it’s just preparation for the war between the Netherworld Sect and the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Many will die in the battle, and I can absorb my sectmembers’ Netherworld Embryos for my cultivation. It would be a waste to leave their Netherworld Embryos behind when they are already dead, right?” Song Yun said.

“Why is the Netherworld Sect going to war with the Immortal Sea Fish Clan?”

“It’s a secret. I can’t tell you.” Song Yun chuckled beneath her hand.

Chu Feng could tell that she didn’t mean to keep the matter from him; it looked more like she was joking. She had always been this mischievous.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng still asked, “Song Yun, can I still believe you?”

The two of them were standing at opposing sides this time. He was going to fight against the Netherworld Sect, and Song Yun seemed to have reached a high standing in the Netherworld Sect.

“Of course. Big brother Chu Feng, you can trust me,” Song Yun said with an earnest look.

“Will you trust me then?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. You will forever be my big brother Chu Feng, the person whom I trust the most,” Song Yun said.

“I shan’t keep things from you then. The Immortal Sea Fish Clan and Xianhai Yu’er are my friends—I reckon you should have already heard about that. I heard not long ago that Xianhai Yu’er was kidnapped, and the culprit is likely to be the Netherworld Sect. Please tell me if you know anything else,” Chu Feng said.

“Big brother Chu Feng, let’s talk somewhere else. It’s not convenient to talk here.” Song Yun grabbed Chu Feng’s hand and dragged him elsewhere. As the two of them soared through the sky, she asked, “Big brother Chu Feng, are you trying to save Xianhai Yu’er?” 

“Yes, I am,” Chu Feng replied.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Has big brother Chu Feng fallen in love with someone else?” Song Yun asked.

“Ah?” Chu Feng was baffled. “What do you mean by that?”

Song Yun stared at Chu Feng earnestly as she asked, “I was kidnapped by a Netherworld Envoy and wasn't able to meet big brother Chu Feng for a long time. We finally reunited after such a long time, but the first thing you asked was if Xianhai Yu’er had been kidnapped. You didn’t bother asking if I have been faring well. Doesn’t this mean that you have fallen in love with someone else?”

“We have never been lovers before. You, like Yu’er, are my good friends,” Chu Feng said.

“Do you distinguish between friends too?” Song Yun looked indignant.

“That’s not it. I heard them calling you ‘milord’, so I knew you were faring decently in the Netherworld Sect,” Chu Feng replied.

“I am faring fine, but that’s not a reason not to care about me. Have you never thought about the difficulties I have been through?” Song Yun asked.

Chu Feng’s heart trembled. Song Yun’s words made sense; it was true that he was prioritizing Little Fishy over Song Yun.

When Song Yun was taken to the Netherworld Sect, he instinctively thought that she would receive good treatment there given her outstanding talent, so he never thought to look for her. He neglected the possibility that Song Yun might have been going through a hard time.

“My apologies, little sister Song Yun. I am worried about Yu’er since I don't know whether she’s dead or alive. However, I’d have done the same for you too if you were the one captured, regardless of who the culprit was,” Chu Feng replied. 

“Was I not captured here?” Song Yun asked.

“Well…” Chu Feng knew that he was wrong here.

“Fine, I shan’t make things difficult for you. With my wits, I was able to win over the upper echelons of the Netherworld Sect. I am doing well here. At least, I am one of their key figures to nurture. Thanks to that, I’d occasionally come into contact with important figures within the sect. 

“It was by coincidence that I heard about the upcoming war between the Netherworld Sect and the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, but I don’t know the exact reason. However, if what big brother Chu Feng said was true, and the Netherworld Sect had kidnapped Xianhai Yu’er, I’d guess that she might be the cause of it. Given Xianhai Yu’er’s talent, there’s no way the Immortal Sea Fish Clan would give up on her. They would surely cause a fuss if the Netherworld Sect kidnapped her. 

“Big brother Chu Feng, we can talk about other matters later on. For now, I’ll try to scout Xianhai Yu’er’s condition on your behalf. However, you need to do me a favor,” Song Yun said.

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“You see, the Netherworld Sect is divided into three factions. There’s the new faction, the conservative faction, and the moderate faction. I am in the conservative faction. 

“Those in the conservative faction tend to be more traditional, but they are relatively kinder too. They would obey the directives of the Netherworld Sect, but they would try their best not to kill the innocent too as they earnestly believe that the Netherworld Sect’s true purpose is to bring blessing to the world. 

“The people whom you have just met are from the new faction. Most of them still obey the rules, but some are downright evil. The upper echelons of the new faction tend to give their subordinates free rein to do whatever they want. They believe that the Netherworld Sect is destined to rise as the rulers of the world of cultivation and trample over everyone else.”

Chu Feng had a rough grasp of the situation as to why there was a decent Netherworld Envoy with principles, yet also a bunch of vermin who massacred the innocent. It turned out that they were split into different factions.

“Do you know why the Netherworld hasn’t caused a fuss in the world of cultivation yet?” Song Yun asked.

“Why?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s not because they aren’t strong enough, but that there’s rivalry among the factions. If the conservative faction takes the helm, the world of cultivation should remain relatively peaceful. However, if the new faction takes the helm, tragedies will happen in the world of cultivation.

“Our world will become much more chaotic than before. The weak will suffer. Most people in the world will become mere cultivation resources for our sectmembers. 

“I heard about the war with the Immortal Sea Fish Clan from the upper echelons of the new faction, so if Xianhai Yu’er was kidnapped, the chances were that they are the ones behind it. However, the new faction has its merits too. Their unscrupulous means have allowed them to obtain more resources than the conservative faction, and they have things I covet.”
