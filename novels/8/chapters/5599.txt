Chapter 5599: A Vile Clan

“Milord,” Chu Feng suddenly heard a weak voice behind him.

He turned around and saw the middle-aged man, who had just been struck by his older sister, with the bullied boy standing beside him.

“I’m begging you, don’t hurt them. Please let them off,” the middle-aged man said.

“Are you afraid they’ll exact vengeance on you? Don’t worry, I’ll make sure they dare not do so,” Chu Feng said.

“I…”

The middle-aged man was taken aback. He had only intervened because he didn’t want to see any harm befalling his clansmen. It was not that he wasn’t afraid of their vengeance, but that he had never even considered it from that angle at all.

Chu Feng opened his palm and produced a bundle of eerie glowing pills. These pills flew straight into the mouths of the kneeling adults and the children. All of the children were unfazed by the effects of the pills, but most of the adults grabbed their heads and howled in pain.

What was weird was that some of the adults were unaffected by the poison pill despite having ingested it too. The one who suffered the most from the effects of the pill was none other than the elegant-looking lady.

“This poison pill is linked to your consciousness. As long as you intend to do harm to this man and his son, that poison pill will torture you with increasing severity till it finally claims your life,” Chu Feng explained.

It turned out that those who were in pain were those who intended to do harm to the middle-aged man and his son. He had constructed these pills from his formations, and their effects were similar to the formations Chaotic Era Scholar had planted in their bodies back then.

It was just that Chu Feng’s means weren’t as great as Chaotic Era Scholar’s, so he had to use medicinal herbs as a medium and forge it into pills. Due to the limitations of his ability, the pill only worked on Martial Exalted level cultivators and below. It wouldn’t work on Half-God level cultivators at all.

Nevertheless, Chu Feng thought that this was enough to deal with these people.

Shortly after listening to Chu Feng’s explanation, those who were groaning in agony recovered from their pain once they curbed their intent to exact vengeance on the middle-aged man and his son. They looked at Chu Feng with frightened eyes upon realizing that he could control their thoughts.

In contrast, the middle-aged man’s eyes lit up in delight. As terrifying as Chu Feng’s means were, he could tell that Chu Feng was doing that to protect him and his son.

“What terrifying means from a young lad,” an old voice echoed across the air.

The surrounding space trembled, and several figures appeared in a neat formation in the sky. They gazed down upon the world with lofty gazes. Most of them were old men who had reached Half-God level in terms of cultivation.

Leading the group was a short and stout white-haired old man. His appearance resembled a white-furred monkey, but the vicious glint in his eyes hinted that he was no kind soul. He was the one who had spoken earlier.

“Grandfather… No, Lord Clan Chief!”

The middle-aged man widened his eyes in horror as he quickly kneeled down with the boy to pay their respects. Those words revealed the old man’s identity.

The old man was the middle-aged man’s grandfather, as well as the clan chief.

Chu Feng had sensed their arrival beforehand, which was why he wasn’t too surprised when they revealed themselves. He could sense their cultivation too, and that was the reason he wasn’t intimidated by their presence.

His eyes, however, were focused on the old copper mirror held in the old man’s hand which came from the Ancient Era. He noticed the old man flashing the copper mirror at him before revealing themselves, which suggested that the copper mirror had some kind of special effect.

“What’s that?” Chu Feng asked.

“You have a sharp eye for treasures. You noticed something special about it. However, there’s no need for a dead man to know that much,” the old man said with a murderous smile.

“I am a mere passerby. I couldn’t stand watching your clansmen bullying their brethren, so I stepped in and taught your clansmen a lesson. Are you going to kill me for that?” Chu Feng asked.

It was no wonder the other clansmen were so unreasonable; it turned out that their clan chief was unreasonable too.

“It’s not your place to punish my clansmen, but that in itself wouldn’t have warranted your death. You possess exceptional means despite your young age… I’m guessing that you’re from a notable background, probably a young master from a distinguished clan,” the old man said.

“You still intend to kill me despite knowing that?” Chu Feng asked.

“Hahaha… I believe in finding opportunities amidst risks. I built my clan with my blade, and it’s my courage that got me this far. A young master from a distinguished background is bound to have plenty of treasures. That’s the reason I’m taking your life here. You are free to interfere in other people’s businesses, but you shouldn’t have flaunted your wealth,” the old man said.

The middle-aged man and his son lowered their heads in shame, but none of the other clansmen was surprised in the least. In fact, most of them even raised their heads in glee.

Chu Feng realized that this was an evil clan that committed all sorts of atrocities. It was no wonder they had no qualms oppressing one of their own.

“You aren’t worried that I have a protective formation?” Chu Feng asked.

“Hahaha…” The old man burst into laughter. He raised his copper mirror and asked, “Didn’t you ask me what this is? I don’t think you’re worthy of knowing the truth, but I’ll do you a favor and let you die a knowing death. This treasure allows me to check if someone has a protective formation, and I have just confirmed that you don’t have a protective formation with you. That’s why I dare to make a move on you.”

The old man flung his sleeves and exerted his martial power. He was a rank five Half-God level cultivator, and that was the reason he dared to make a move on Chu Feng. His martial power harnessed killing intent.

“Hm?” Much to the old man’s shock, the martial power stopped right in front of Chu Feng, as if an invisible barrier was stopping it. “What’s going on?”

The old man began to panic, and his earlier confident expression faded. He took out his copper mirror once more and directed it at Chu Feng once more.

“There isn’t anything! There shouldn’t have been anything!” the old man exclaimed.

“It looks like your treasure doesn’t work well. You can’t even tell whether I have a protective formation or not,” Chu Feng sneered.

As a matter of fact, he did have a protective formation, the one his father had planted on him, but the old man’s copper mirror didn’t reflect it at all. It might be because his father’s protective formation was made out of a martial power or that it was discreet, but regardless, it showed that the old man’s copper mirror wasn’t that potent.

“Impossible! My mirror has never failed before. There’s no way I would fail here!” the old man exclaimed as he whipped out an Exalted Armament saber with a flick of his wrist.

He plummeted from the sky to hack his blade down on Chu Feng.

Klang!

Powerful shockwaves rippled, sending many flying into the distance. However, Chu Feng, as well as the middle-aged man and his son, remained unharmed.

“It looks like you have done a lot of such things,” Chu Feng said with narrowed eyes.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“You… What’s going on?” The old man stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.

“You have aged in vain. You can’t even figure out this much?” Chu Feng replied as he manifested his spirit power to form a defensive barrier around him and the father-son duo.

This barrier was the reason they had remained unharmed thus far.

“That spirit power belongs to a Gold Dragon Mark World Spiritist!” The face of the old men standing in the sky paled in fright.

“Gold Dragon World Spiritist?!”

The middle-aged man and the others were taken aback. Even the old man was unable to maintain his composure. It was a huge deal for a junior to become a Golden Dragon Mark World Spiritist, especially considering the possible connotation.

“Lord Clan Chief, could he be from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” another elder asked with a quivering voice.

“Are you from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” the old man asked as he assessed Chu Feng from head to toe.

“Will you not dare to touch me if I’m from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? I guess you aren’t as bold as I thought,” Chu Feng sneered.

“Hahahaha!” The old man suddenly burst into laughter even though the worry in his eyes didn’t lessen in the slightest. His eyes turned even more vicious. “It would be even better if you’re a prodigy from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. How lucky am I to get a chance to rob one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s prodigies?”

A gigantic silhouette manifested above the old man. It was a Divine Body that enhanced the old man's cultivation, raising it to rank six Half-God level. He then swung his blade once more to hack down on Chu Feng.

However, much to the old man’s shock, he was still unable to harm Chu Feng.

“Aren’t you a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist?” the old man asked.

A Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist should possess strength comparable to a rank five Half-God level cultivator; Chu Feng shouldn’t have been able to withstand his attack.
