Chapter 5325: I, Chu Feng, Am Not From the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion

“You!!! I’ll slaughter you!” Jia Chengying charged toward Bai Yunqing with overwhelming killing intent.

“Lie down.” 

Bai Yunqing exerted his oppressive might, and Jia Chengying immediately collapsed on the ground like a dead dog. Jia Chengying stood no chance at all with his cultivation and spirit power sealed off.

“Woah. Jia Chengying, your Pill Dao Immortal Sect sure has amazing treasures. The poison you gave me sure is incredible.” Bai Yunqing burst into hearty laughter. 

“Bai Yunqing, you dog! I-I-I… Pu!” 

Fresh blood spurted from Jia Chengying’s mouth. He was spewing blood out of sheer rage.

“You fool.”

Zhou Dong and Qin Shu looked at Jia Chengying without the slightest pity. The two of them thought that he was hopelessly foolish. Had it not been for him, they wouldn’t have landed in this plight. 

“Bai Yunqing, I’ll never forgive you for this betrayal,” Jia Chengying spat.

“I’ve only treated you courteously out of respect for the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Did you think that I’m afraid of you? You have to be truly dumb to think that. My master is the First Guest Elder of the Totem Dragon Clan!” Bai Yunqing replied fearlessly. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Big brother, how should we deal with them?”

“Tie them up,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, I am Qin Xuan’s younger brother. I suggest that you give me the antidote right now, or else my older brother won’t let you off,” Qin Shu threatened.

“Qin Xuan?” 

“That’s right!”

“I don’t know him,” Chu Feng replied.

“Y-you don’t know my older brother?” Qin Shu could hardly believe what he had just heard. There was actually a person in this world who hadn’t heard of his older brother?!

“Big brother, do you really not know Qin Shu?” Bai Yunqing leaned toward Chu Feng and asked.

“I really don’t know him. Is his older brother powerful?” Chu Feng asked.

“Very much so. His older brother, Qin Xuan, is the strongest junior of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect,” Bai Yunqing earnestly replied. He thought that it would be best for Chu Feng not to cross Qin Xuan for his own good.

“Ah, so he’s the strongest prodigy of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect,” Chu Feng exclaimed in realization.

Qin Shu revealed a gleeful look upon hearing those words.

But Chu Feng suddenly turned to him and asked, “But what does your older brother being strong have to do with you? Are you going to rely on your brother for everything just because he’s strong? Are you going to have him consummate your marriage in your stead too?”

“W-what the hell are you saying? How can you be that despicable?” Qin Shu’s eyeballs nearly popped out of their eyes.

“Despicable? You’re the one who mentioned your older brother when you realized that you aren’t a match for me. Not only are you despicable, but you’re also a sore loser,” Chu Feng scoffed.

Qin Shu was rendered speechless. He was indeed a sore loser, but there was no way he would admit to that. 

“You don’t move. I’ll tie them up myself,” Chu Feng told Bai Yunqing.

He didn’t mind getting into trouble himself since he didn’t have any weaknesses that others could exploit in the Totem Galaxy, but the same couldn’t be said about Bai Yunqing. As much as possible, he didn’t want to implicate Bai Yunqing into this matter. 

In the first place, he was planning to deal with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. If the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and Bluemoon Sacred Palace chose to get in his way, he didn’t mind getting rid of them along the way. 

Chu Feng had a deep understanding of the poison, having modified it himself. The poison would render those three helpless for sixty hours, so they shouldn’t be able to pull anything during this period of time as long as he tied them up. 

Of course, he could have outright killed them too, but he didn’t think that there was a need to blow things up to that extent. It was an easy way out, but it could lead to more trouble later on. After all, there were people from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, Bluemoon Sacred Palace, and Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect waiting outside. 

If Jia Chengying and the others failed to leave the Ancient Realm alive, those powers might just direct their aggression toward Chu Feng. 

“How dare you tie me up, Chu Feng? I’ll remember this humiliation and return it to you many times over!” Jia Chengying menacingly threatened.

“Don’t you think that you have embarrassed yourself enough yet?” Chu Feng sneered.

That further fanned Jia Chengying’s anger.

Qin Shu neither spoke nor struggled, but he continued glaring at Chu Feng with cold eyes. Unexpectedly, the reticent Zhou Dong spoke up when it was finally his turn to be tied up.

“Chu Feng, I advise you to release me and cure my poison. It’ll be difficult for you to breach this formation alone. You need my help. I’ll help you breach the formation,” Zhou Dong said. 

“I’m sorry, but I got this poison from Jia Chengying. I don’t have the antidote for it. But even if I had it, I wouldn’t have given it to you. I truly intended to work together with you, but you double-crossed me. If Bai Yunqing hadn’t been on my side, I would be the one suffering right now. You aren’t qualified to work together with me anymore,” Chu Feng replied.

“Heh…” Zhou Dong sneered. “Chu Feng, you must not know how difficult the formation is. Do you really think that you can breach the final part of the formation with just Bai Yunqing’s help? I’ll put it out here. Without my help, you absolutely won’t be able to breach the formation,” Zhou Dong said. 

“Is that so? Open your eyes wide and watch closely as the two of us breach this formation,” Chu Feng said.

He looked at Bai Yunqing, and the latter caught his drift. The two of them stepped into their respective formation cores and continued breaching the formation.

Zhou Dong initially continued looking at the two of them in disdain, but as Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing’s formations started to transform, he began to lose his cool. Chu Feng had constructed an extremely powerful formation, but this formation was incredibly difficult to control.

To aid him, Bai Yunqing had constructed a supporting formation.

In Zhou Dong’s view, even if Chu Feng had Bai Yunqing’s support, it would still be difficult for him to control the formation. Only a person whose world spiritist techniques surpassed a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist could possibly tame that formation.   

Yet, from the start to the end, Chu Feng demonstrated firm control over the unruly formation, not allowing the slightest instability to occur at all. 

“This is impossible. What’s going on with that fellow? How could a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist like him exert such powerful control over that formation?” Zhou Dong couldn’t believe his eyes.

He was a highly talented world spiritist, but even he would have struggled to control the powerful formation Chu Feng had constructed. How in the world was Chu Feng managing it that easily as a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist?

Could he be from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? A thought suddenly surfaced in Zhou Dong’s mind. He shouted aloud, “Chu Feng, are you from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

Qin Shu and Jia Chengying immediately turned to look at Chu Feng. Nervousness could be seen in their eyes. 

If Chu Feng was really from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, it was likely that he would be of considerable standing given his talents. If so, they would have no choice but to swallow their grievances today. It wouldn’t be wise to cross the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion over such a minor issue. 

Chu Feng, who was focused on breaching the formation, stopped what he was doing upon hearing Zhou Dong’s words. The atmosphere suddenly changed. He turned to Zhou Dong with a severe look on his face.

“I, Chu Feng, am not from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

After saying those words, he turned his attention back to breaching the formation. He didn’t want to talk too much about this topic. 

Upon hearing the answer, Zhou Dong, Qin Shu, and Jia Chengying heaved sighs of relief. 

It didn’t take Chu Feng long to breach the formation that Zhou Dong said he absolutely wouldn’t have been able to breach. The gate finally opened, revealing the pathway ahead.  nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

By breaching the formation, Chu Feng obtained a crucial clue about an extremely difficult trial ahead. He glanced at the trio and said, “The three of you wait here. We’ll clear the final test.”

Leaving those words behind, he passed through the gate together with Bai Yunqing and Miss Bai.

Zhou Dong and the others felt aggrieved. In particular, Jia Chengying kept spewing threats at Chu Feng. It was only when Chu Feng was finally gone that Zhou Dong finally spoke up, “Shut your mouth, you useless thing. We wouldn’t have landed in this position if not for you.”

Zhou Dong’s eyes were so wintry that they terrified Jia Chengying.

“I didn’t think that Bai Yunqing would betray me. How am I to know that he would take Chu Feng as his big brother when they have only been through a single test together? That spineless thing. What a disappointment!” Jia Chengying spat.

“Cut the nonsense and listen to my commands,” Zhou Dong said coldly.

Qin Shu was overjoyed to hear that. “Brother Zhou, do you know of a way for us to free ourselves?”

“I don’t,” Zhou Dong replied.

Qin Shu’s face sank in disappointment. “What’s the point of listening to your command when we’re stuck here?”

“Based on my estimate, the effects of this poison last for around sixty hours. There’s no way they’ll be able to clear the final test within sixty hours. We still have a chance,” Zhou Dong said. 

“How do you know that they aren’t able to clear the test within sixty hours? I didn’t find any information suggesting that in the formation earlier on,” Jia Chengying said.

“That’s why I’m telling you to follow my commands. No matter what it takes, I have to be the one to clear this final test,” Zhou Dong said before closing his eyes to rest. 

Qin Shu and Jia Chengying glanced at each other. They could sense that Zhou Dong seemed to know something about this final test that they were oblivious to. Perhaps, they might really still stand a chance here.

Boom!

The opened gate suddenly closed, and the formation reappeared. 

That sight killed any hopes that had barely sparked in Jia Chengying and Qin Shu’s hearts. Even Zhou Dong’s complexion also turned awful.

The reappearance of the formation meant that they had to breach it once more before they could chase after Chu Feng and the others, but that was easier said than done. In the first place, closing a sixty hours lead was no easy feat, not to mention that Chu Feng was a highly competent individual. 

Against such disadvantageous circumstances, it was inevitable that they would think that the final test was already over for them. 

“It’ll be best if we still stand a chance.”

They also hoped that Zhou Dong was right. Rather than exacting vengeance on Chu Feng after everything was over, they would rather bring him down right here. However, the truth was that they didn’t harbor any expectations anymore.
