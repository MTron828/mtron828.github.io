Chapter 3222 - Cultivation Treasures

“With my understanding of your Li Heavenly Clan, you all would not have chosen to yield to the Linghu Heavenly Clan, no?” Chu Feng asked Li Anzhi with a smile on his face.

Although the two of them were opponents at the Chu Heavenly Clan, and were determined to kill one another, the situation now was different from back then.

Although they could not be considered to be friends, they were at least on the same boat.

“Our Li Heavenly Clan will naturally not miss out on this opportunity. That said, it’s all thanks to you that we’re able to enter this place.”

“Chu Feng, thank you,” Li Anzhi smiled and clasped his fist at Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, thank you,” following him, the others from the Li Heavenly Clan also clasped their fists at Chu Feng.

Actually, Li Anzhi was not the only newcomer from the Li Heavenly Clan that Chu Feng had met before.

Practically all of the newcomers from the Li Heavenly Clan were familiar faces.

Li Yan and Li Tianyou, those most outstanding people of the younger generation from the Li Heavenly Clan, all went to the Chu Heavenly Clan to make trouble for Chu Feng before.

Regardless of how much they detested Chu Feng in the past, regardless of how much they still detested Chu Feng, it was indeed all thanks to Chu Feng that they were able to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.

As such, they all felt that they should express their thanks to Chu Feng.

“There’s no need to stand on ceremony. Are you all really not planning to follow me?” Chu Feng asked.

“We’ve already troubled you enough to be able to come to this place. If we are unable to find cultivation resources with our own abilities after coming to this place, then perhaps... we are truly not qualified to stay in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,” Li Anzhi said.

“Since you’ve already made your decision, I, Chu Feng, will not attempt to persuade you. However, take this,” as Chu Feng spoke, he raised his arm, and a body of light flew toward Li Anzhi.

Due to the fact that the body of light shot straight toward Li Anzhi’s face, Li Anzhi revealed a trace of panic. He thought that Chu Feng was trying to attack him. Thus, he raised his hand to grab the incoming body of light.

However, when that body of light entered his hand, Li Anzhi’s expression changed.

“Chu Feng, what are you...?!!!”

Li Anzhi began to look to Chu Feng with a complicated expression.

The reason for that was because that body of light assimilated with Li Anzhi’s body upon reaching his hand. It turned out to be a piece of information.

Contained within that body of light was a location in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light with cultivation resources.

Furthermore, that location was very remote. Likely, no one would expect that location to have such an enormous amount of cultivation resources.

To put it simply, the location of that cultivation resource site was very safe, and if they went there, they would have a very slim chance of encountering the Li Heavenly Clansmen.

A cultivation site like that was most definitely very rare and precious. However, Chu Feng actually ended up giving such a location to Li Anzhi.

“There’s a friend of mine in the Li Heavenly Clan,” Chu Feng said.

Li Anzhi understood that Chu Feng did not do this to help them. Instead, he had done this out of respect for that friend of his.

“May you tell me who that friend of yours is?” Li Anzhi asked.

“Li Yue’er,” Chu Feng said.

“It’s her?!” Chu Feng’s words not only caused Li Anzhi’s expression to change, but the others from the Li Heavenly Clan also revealed a surprised expression. None of them had anticipated that Chu Feng had a relationship with Li Yue’er.

After being surprised, the Li Heavenly Clansmen revealed complicated expressions. Although Li Yue’er was indeed a member of their Li Heavenly Clan, she was actually an opponent to them.

“I will not be going there. As such, you all can have it. As for whether or not you will go there, it’s up to you all to decide,” Chu Feng spoke with a light smile.

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng added, “Those that are willing to brave dangers, follow me.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng soared into the sky. Seeing that, the crowd also soared into the sky after him. In the blink of an eye, they all disappeared into the distant sky.

At that moment, only the several people from the Li Heavenly Clan remained.

Someone immediately walked over to Li Anzhi and asked him, “Anzhi, that Chu Feng told you the location of cultivation resources?” It was Li Yan.

Although Li Anzhi and Chu Feng had not said it explicitly, the Li Heavenly Clansmen were able to tell what was going on from their conversation.

Chu Feng should’ve helped them.

“Mn, this cultivation site is very good. Likely, we will be able to avoid the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen by going there,” Li Anzhi said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Big brother, that Chu Feng is an enemy and not a friend. Could he be planning to harm us?” Li Tianyou did not trust Chu Feng.

“That’s unlikely. Although the time I’ve been in contact with him is very short, I feel that Chu Feng is actually a very sincere and true person. He doesn’t resemble the kind of person that would do that sort of treacherous thing,” Li Anzhi said.

“Then what should we do? Should we accept Chu Feng’s help?” Someone asked.

“This opportunity is rare. Let’s consider that we owe that Chu Feng a favor,” after Li Anzhi finished saying those words, he soared into the sky.

Seeing that, the others from the Li Heavenly Clan also soared into the sky after Li Anzhi.

They began to fly toward the direction Chu Feng had indicated to him.

......

Leading the crowd, Chu Feng arrived at a vast ocean that covered one’s entire field of vision.

Following Chu Feng, the crowd entered the ocean and arrived deep at the bottom of the sea.

Upon entering the ocean, the crowd discovered that a mountain range was actually hidden in the depths of the ocean. Hidden within that mountain range were ores, white ores.

The white ores were very small, like fireflies. The tiny white ores were embedded into the rock walls.

However, those tiny white ores were emitting energies that caused everyone’s eyes to shine with light and excitement.

The reason for that was because those tiny white ores not only contained natural energies, but they also contained martial comprehension. Furthermore, the mixture of natural energies and martial comprehension seemed to be capable of assimilating into one’s body without any comprehension required.

Cultivation treasures. Those white ores were most definitely rare cultivation treasures!!!

“The Holy Spirit Formation of Light’s reputation is truly well-deserved!” Seeing the white ores, the crowd became endlessly excited.

Like starving ghosts that saw a huge banquet before their eyes, the crowd pounced violently toward the mountain range before them. Using their various abilities, they began to attempt to excavate those white ores.

“Eh? Why can’t I get it out?”

However, after attempting to excavate the ores, the crowd became perplexed.

They discovered that they were unable to excavate the ores with weapons or martial power.

In fact, the stones of the mountain range seemed to be indestructible.

They, a bunch of martial cultivators, were actually baffled by that vast mountain range and its endless amount of tiny white ores.
