MGA: Chapter 1250 - I’m Sorry

Even though the three elders were extremely weak and suffering the pain of being burned by the formation, they were extremely calm.

Not only were the three of them sitting in cross-legged positions above the formation without speaking a word, they did not even utter a sound.

Their willpower was worthy of admiration. Yet, it pained Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen deeply.

“Elders!!!” After hesitating, Chu Feng still shouted with a soft voice.

When they heard Chu Feng’s shout, the three elders all opened their eyes. At the moment they opened their eyes, weakness and exhaustion were displayed in their gazes.

It could be seen that regardless of how powerful they were and how strong their perseverance was, they still suffered an enormous pain and torment in this formation.

However, even though they were trapped within this torment, the three elders all displayed a smile of comfort after seeing Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.

“You’ve come,” Elder Hong Mo said with a smile. He seemed to have already anticipated Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.

“Elders, we’ve made you suffer,” Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen said with grief and regret. At this time, Bai Ruochen was unable to contain herself, and two streams of tears rolled down her cheeks.

“Sigh, what are the two of you doing? How could someone from our Medicine Concocting Department be this disgraceful? Ruochen, you must not cry,” When he saw that Bai Ruochen started to cry, Elder Zhou Quan spoke in an annoyed manner.

“That’s right. Chu Feng, Ruochen, what’s with your ashamed expressions? Us being caught is unrelated to the two of you. So why are you blindly blaming yourselves?” Elder Wei said.

“That’s right. As management elders of the Medicine Concocting Department, we’ve only done what we needed to do in order to protect our Medicine Concocting Department’s dignity.”

“Let alone, Ying’er is our Medicine Concocting Department’s guest. I promised her grandfather that I would take proper care of her. However, after she came to our Cyanwood Mountain, she was actually beaten up and humiliated by others. As such, how could I possibly be able to not let down her late grandfather?”

“These, the two of you really shouldn’t blame yourselves. Even if this had not involved the two of you, we would still have done this for Ying’er,” Elder Hong Mo consoled them with a smile on his face.

However, after hearing what the three elders said, Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen instead felt even more pain in their hearts. The two of them were able to tell that the three elders only said those words because they did not want them to blame themselves.

It was clearly because of them that the three elders ended up in such a state. Yet, the three elders were still thinking about Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen. Their kind intentions moved Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen deeply. Yet, at the same time, it also pained their hearts.

“You’ve seen them now, it’s time to leave,” Right at this moment, the Punishment Department’s elders began to urge Chu Feng and them to leave. It was clear that they did not want them to talk with Elder Hong Mo and the other elders for a long period of time.

“Elder Hong Mo, Elder Wei, Elder Zhou, what must I do in order to save the three of you?” Seeing that the situation was turning bad, Chu Feng hurriedly asked them via voice transmission. He could not just sit by and do nothing, he could not ignore the three elders.

As long as there was even a slight possibility of being able to help the three elders, then even if Chu Feng had to go through water and tread on fire, he would still do it.

“Chu Feng, don’t worry about us.”

“The Punishment Department doesn’t dare to do anything much to us. Just return.”

“As long as you all are safe and sound, we three old men will be at ease,” However, Elder Hong Mo and the other elders merely smiled lightly, and did not give Chu Feng any suggestion as to how to help them.

However, the more it was like this, the more unease Chu Feng felt. That was because it meant that it might be possible that Chu Feng really would have no means of saving the three elders, and that their current situations were truly bad.

After they left the Punishment Department, Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen returned to the Asura Division together. The two of them were silently frowning with worry and their frames of mind were extremely heavy.

“Master, there is a guest that wanted to see you,” This sort of state lasted all the way till a female servant appeared.

“Regardless of who it is, tell them to return. I am in no mood to see guests,” Chu Feng waved his hand and indicated to that female servant to drive away the person that had come.

“You don’t want to see even me?” However, right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded. At the same time, a figure appeared before Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.

“It’s you?” When they saw the person who had come, both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were surprised. That was because it was Sima Ying.

“Is it that surprising?” Sima Ying looked to Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen with a smile on her face. At this moment, her injuries had been completely healed and she had a light smile on her face. It seemed as if she had finally walked out from the pain of her grandfather’s death.

“Why did you come here?” Bai Ruochen’s mood was bad to begin with. When she saw Sima Ying’s smiling appearance, she began to feel angry.

One must know that the current state of the three elders being imprisoned by the Punishment Department was also largely because of Sima Ying. Yet, Sima Ying came with such an indifferent appearance; not only did she not show any concern for the three elders, she was even smiling. It truly felt to Bai Ruochen that she lacked conscience.

Suddenly, Sima Ying’s expression changed and she spoke with a serious tone, “Actually, I’ve come here to apologize to the two of you.”

“What?” Hearing those words, both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were startled. They did not dare to believe that someone like Sima Ying would say those words.

“I’m sorry.” However, at the moment when Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were still skeptical of what they had heard, Sima Ying actually apologized to them. Furthermore, she even apologetically bowed to them. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This scene stunned both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen. If it was someone else, this would be something that was extremely normal. However, when it was Sima Ying, it appeared to be unimaginable.

After all, that girl was as crafty and unruly as could be. Furthermore, she was extremely ignorant of the ways of the world. That was something that both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen had experienced themselves.

“I know that your lives in the Cyanwood Mountain were originally very good. At the very least, in the core region, you two were geniuses that countless people adored.”

“However, your current situation is extremely bad. And all of this is because of me. If I had not been impulsive, you would not have been degraded to your current state, and the three elders would also not have been arrested.”

“I... am truly a bearer of ill luck. Not only did I cause the death of my father and mother, I... even caused the death of my grandfather. And now... I’ve even implicated you all. I am truly...”

When she spoke to this point, Sima Ying actually started to cry. Furthermore, her crying became more and more emotional. In the end, she actually lost herself and knelt onto the ground with her frail body shivering.

At this moment, how was she still that rude and unreasonable, crafty and unruly girl? She was simply a pitiful child, a child that had lost her way and was unable to find her family.

When they saw this, both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were emotionally moved.

No matter how despotic Sima Ying was, no matter how rude and unreasonable she was, she was, after all, a girl. Deep within her heart was a side of weakness.

Merely, she rarely revealed that weak side. Yet now, she actually revealed it before Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.

Chu Feng was able to tell that she was not acting and was truly feeling guilt and shame. From her current state, Chu Feng was able to tell that she truly blamed herself from the bottom of her heart.

She had not come to apologize for the sake of obtaining forgiveness from Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen. Instead, she truly felt that she had caused them suffering, that she had let them down. That was why she came to apologize.

At this moment, Chu Feng took a glance at Bai Ruochen and hinted to her to console Sima Ying. After all, no matter what, it was rude for a man to touch a woman. Especially since he and Sima Ying were not very familiar with one another; it would be a bit more suitable for Bai Ruochen to console her.

Even though Bai Ruochen felt that Sima Ying was very repulsive, she had become soft-hearted at this moment. Thus, she did not hesitate, and began to walk up to Sima Ying to console her.

Sima Ying was actually a very strong individual. It was merely that her weakest side had been triggered earlier. Thus, after a simple hug and pat from Bai Ruochen, she quickly returned to normal.

Suddenly, Sima Ying said, “Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen, I’ll be leaving.”
