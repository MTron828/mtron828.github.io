Chapter 3758 - Strange Laughter

“Chu Feng actually managed to injure Linghu Zhishi?”

“This... this is simply too unimaginable!”

“Even if the Battle God’s Halberd has increased his cultivation, it has only increased his cultivation to rank two Utmost Exalted, no?”

The crowd were all exclaiming in admiration. If they hadn’t witnessed it with their own eyes, they simply wouldn’t dare to believe that Chu Feng could actually injure Linghu Zhishi.

In fact, even Linghu Zhishi himself had a look of disbelief on his face as he looked at his wound.

He had felt that using a treasure to increase one’s cultivation simply could not be compared to actual cultivation gained through training.

It was much like how he still viewed Gu Mingyuan to be an ant, completely powerless to contend against him, even though she had managed to increase her cultivation to rank two Utmost Exalted through her bloodline’s power.

Even if Gu Mingyuan was to take those forbidden medicines, Linghu Zhishi still wouldn’t place her in his eyes.

Thus, even though Chu Feng was holding the legendary weapon, the Battle God’s Halberd in his hand, Linghu Zhishi still did not place him in his eyes.

Yet, the person that he looked down on actually managed to inflict a serious injury upon him.

This greatly surprised Linghu Zhishi. At the same time... he found it completely intolerable.

To him, this was simply a humiliation.

“Chu Feng, I will dismember your body into ten thousand pieces!!!”

After a brief moment of being stunned, Linghu Zhishi let out a loud roar.

Then, he took out a weapon and rushed forward to attack Chu Feng.

His weapon was a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament.

Even though one could use Incomplete Exalted Armaments at the Exalted realm, Utmost Exalted experts would be able to unleash its power even better. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Thus, with the Incomplete Exalted Armament in hand, Linghu Zhishi’s battle power immediately surged.

However, even when facing such a Linghu Zhishi, Chu Feng still showed no trace of fear.

Holding the Battle God’s Halberd in hand, he rushed forth.

“Boom, boom, boom, boom!!!”

Suddenly, rumbles sounded nonstop, and ripples began to wreak havoc everywhere.

Chu Feng and Linghu Zhishi had collided in battle.

Their battle had surpassed the observational abilities of the crowd.

Apart from Gu Mingyuan, the people present, including Utmost Exalted-level experts like Grandmaster Liangqiu, were all unable to clearly see the battle between Chu Feng and Linghu Zhishi.

In fact, even Gu Mingyuan was only able to see the general situation of the battle, and was unable to clearly see the fight between Chu Feng and Linghu Zhishi.

“That boy Chu Feng is truly powerful.”

Even though Gu Mingyuan was only able to see the rough situation of the battle, she was unable to keep herself from praising Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because she was capable of determining that he held the upper hand in the battle. He was suppressing Linghu Zhishi the entire time.

Even though Linghu Zhishi had revealed his Incomplete Exalted Armament and was using his martial skills, he was still unable to gain the slightest bit of an advantage over Chu Feng.

While it was most certainly true that the Battle God’s Halberd had bestowed Chu Feng with power, his superiority in the battle was most definitely also due to his own techniques.

In fact, Gu Mingyuan felt that Chu Feng was not going all-out. Facing Linghu Zhishi, the current strongest expert of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Chu Feng was actually acting very confident and at-ease.

Because of that, Gu Mingyuan felt that should Chu Feng be given a sufficient cultivation, he would be able to obtain superiority over anyone in a battle.

Seeing the superiority displayed by Chu Feng, Gu Mingyuan not only had a look of joy in her eyes, but ice-cold killing intent also flashed through her eyes.

With ice-cold killing intent, she looked towards the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s army.

“Linghu Heavenly Clan, you all ought to pay the price.”

As Gu Mingyuan said those words, she began to walk toward the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s army. Furthermore, a sword appeared in her hand.

“Gu Mingyuan, what are you trying to do?!”

Seeing Gu Mingyuan walking towards them in such an aggressive manner, the expressions of the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders all changed enormously. They hurriedly stood before their clansmen.

“You all came here today with the intention to massacre us. Yet now, you’re asking me what I plan to do?”

“Since you want to know so much, I might as well tell you.”

“Today, I, Gu Mingyuan, will unleash a massacre upon your Linghu Heavenly Clan!!!”

“Woosh~~~”

After she finished saying those words, Gu Mingyuan’s body shifted, and she rushed towards the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s army.

With the help of her bloodline power, Gu Mingyuan’s cultivation was that of a rank two Utmost Exalted.

As for the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, even their Supreme Elders were only rank one Utmost Exalted.

Such a Gu Mingyuan was simply akin to a ferocious beast entering a flock of sheep.

Not to mention the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, even those Supreme Elders were completely helpless before her.

Right after Gu Mingyuan moved, screams sounded nonstop, and blood splattered everywhere. A vast amount of blood poured down from the sky like rain.

In merely the blink of an eye, several thousand people were killed by Gu Mingyuan.

However, one needed to know that Gu Mingyuan did not utilize her oppressive might or any martial skills.

She was slaughtering those Linghu Heavenly Clansmen with the sword in her hand.

Furthermore, she was killing them with a slash each. However, even though she was using such a tedious method, she still managed to cause massive casualties to the Linghu Heavenly Clan in a short period of time.

Screams sounded nonstop. The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were fleeing in all directions.

Fear, panic and the sound of weeping filled the vast sea of people.

However, those were all completely useless. To Gu Mingyuan, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were inferior to even a flock of sheep. They were more like a pile of fruits and vegetables.

For Gu Mingyuan, killing them was easier than cutting a gourd or chopping vegetables.

The more she killed, the more ferocious she became. She raised her hand and slashed her sword down without any hesitation.

“This...”

“This...”

At that moment, the crowd no longer had any heart to observe the battle between Chu Feng and Linghu Zhishi.

Instead, their gazes were all focused on the direction of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.

As they saw the rain of blood pouring down from the sky nonstop, and thought of how it was the blood of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, many people began to tremble with fear.

Massacre. This was truly a massacre. Gu Mingyuan was showing no hesitation at all as she slaughtered the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.

“Gu Mingyuan, cease your hands!!!”

Seeing that, Linghu Zhishi let out a furious roar.

Gu Mingyuan was too powerful. If he didn’t stop her, she would be able to massacre all his clansmen in no time.

Unfortunately, he was pinned down by Chu Feng. It was simply impossible for him to save his clansmen.

He could only watch as Gu Mingyuan massacred his clansmen one by one.

“Are you still not going to act?! How much longer are you planning to watch this show?!”

Suddenly, Linghu Zhishi let out another shout of anger.

After hearing his shout of anger, the crowd were all confused.

The reason for that was because his furious shout was not only a furious shout. It seemed more like he was speaking to someone.

However, his words were clearly not meant for the people present.

At the moment when the crowd were feeling confused, a strange laugh was heard.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk...”

“Linghu Heavenly Clan, you are all truly useless.”

“I’ve already helped you get rid of the Wuming Clan.”

“Yet, you are unable to even handle a bunch of trash from the Ancestral Martial Starfield?”
