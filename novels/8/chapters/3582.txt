Chapter 3582 - Invoked Greed

“Excuse me, how did you all manage to do that?”

Finally, the crowd were unable to help themselves, and began to question the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

However, not only did the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen not answer them, they instead rolled their eyes at them and sneered mockingly.

“So much for being on the same boat. Turns out, you only care about yourselves. In the end, demon clansmen are demon clansmen.”

Seeing that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were unwilling to help them, some people grew so furious that they began to make cutting remarks.

“Boom~~~”

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, right after that person spoke, he was knocked flying backwards and ruthlessly smashed into the palace hall’s wall. By the time the crowd managed to react, that person had fainted.

It was the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“We never said that we were on the same boat. We are still mortal enemies. We’re not killing you only because we’re giving young friend Chu Feng face.”

“Thus, I’ll warn you all this one last time, do not provoke this old man. Otherwise, I will be taking your lives,” the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief said coldly.

The crowd were all enraged upon hearing those words. However, none of them dared to voice their complaints. They could only grumble in their hearts.

Indeed, they were mortal enemies against the Blood-devouring Demon Clan. There was indeed no need for the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen to care about them.

Earlier, it was they that were muddled by their desire.

To seek advice from the demon clansmen was truly humiliating, truly ridiculous.

“Milord, we cannot allow the demon clansmen to seize this decisive opportunity. It will become very unfavorable for us.”

“That’s right. Whilst that Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief spoke as if he is giving Chu Feng face, who doesn’t know that it’s because you can contain him, and that he does not dare to have a complete falling-out just yet?”

“But, the stone chairs possess such intense natural energies. It is likely that they also contain martial comprehension. If we ignore the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief, he might even be able to make a breakthrough.”

“If he is to become an Utmost Exalted, not even you, Milord, would be able to keep him in check. At that time... we will all be doomed.”

The people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan and many other powers were all sending voice transmissions to Tantai Yinjian.

Tantai Yinjian was the only person that they could rely on now.

As for Tantai Yinjian, he was an experienced and knowledgeable individual. Naturally, he knew that those people were speaking pleasantly because they wanted to learn how to ascend onto the stone chairs from him.

“Everyone, I am unable to help you. Ascending those chairs and obtaining this rare cultivation opportunity is not something that can be accomplished by putting forth effort. Likely, the great majority of the people present have already missed out on this opportunity,” said Tantai Yinjian.

“Lord Tantai Yinjian, what do you mean by that?”

Tantai Yinjian’s words caused the crowd to panic. However, still unwilling to give up, they continued to question him.

“If this old man has guessed correctly, whether or not one can ascend to a chair should depend on this golden fruit.”

As Tantai Yinjian spoke, he flipped his palm. When he opened his palm, a golden fruit appeared in his hand.

The golden fruit resembled a walnut. However, not only was it glimmering, but it was also emitting an extraordinary aura. One could tell from a glance that it was an extraordinary item.

“Could that be the legendary golden fruit that could allow one to enter the Sacred Palace Hall?” The crowd’s eyes all started to shine upon seeing the golden fruit.

“Woosh~~~”

Wind swept forth. It was Tantai Yinjian. He had leapt forth.

Tantai Yinjian flew toward one of the stone chairs.

At that moment, the crowd were able to clearly see golden light emitting from Tantai Yinjian’s body. The golden light was being emitted from the golden fruit he held in his hand.

That golden fruit had turned into golden light.

At that moment, the crowd came to a realization. It seemed that whether or not one could ascend onto a stone chair depended on whether or not they possessed a golden fruit, and nothing else.

After learning that, the crowd were unable to keep themselves from looking at the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen. They cursed in their hearts at how treacherous they were.

The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen clearly knew the reason, yet they did not inform anyone. Instead, they coerced the crowd to attempt to ascend the stone chairs themselves, leaving many of them injured, and even one dead.

That said, they only dared to curse the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen in their hearts. After witnessing the ruthlessness of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief, no one dared to provoke him.

“People of our Chu Heavenly Clan, go ahead and train.”

Suddenly, a voice was heard. It was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Even though he had a very ugly look on his face, even though there were still glistening teardrops in his eyes, even though one could tell that he was still grieving, he had stood back up.

After he finished saying those words, he also leapt toward one of the floating stone chairs.

Many people had anticipated such an action from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

After all, many people present had witnessed how he had managed to obtain a golden fruit with his strength.

With the golden fruit in hand, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief effortlessly reached a stone chair, sat down on it, and began training.

Seeing that, the others from the Chu Heavenly Clan all sat down cross-legged, closed their eyes, formed hand seals and began to operate their cultivation techniques to absorb the natural energies of that place to train.

However, to the crowd’s surprise...

After many people gave up on ascending to the stone chairs, Li Ruochu and Kong Tianhui both leapt forth.

This came as a surprise to many people.

After all, they were able to understand the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen being able to obtain a large amount of golden fruits because they knew about the circumstances inside the Void Sacred Tree.

As for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Tantai Yinjian, the two of them were peak Exalted with great strength. Thus, it was also reasonable for them to be able to obtain golden fruits.

Li Ruochu and Kong Tianhui, on the other hand, clearly lacked strength.

That said, although they were surprised, the crowd were able to understand after thinking carefully about it. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Although Li Ruochu and Kong Tianhui might not be as strong as Tantai Yinjian, they were definitely peak existences among the younger generation. That was something that everyone acknowledged.

Thus, if they were able to obtain golden fruits, it would mean that they were also people that had great luck in addition to their extraordinary strength.

That said, it was still enviable. After all, everyone present wanted to obtain that cultivation opportunity.

Unfortunately for them, reality was cruel. Since they were unable to ascend to a stone chair, they had no choice but to train where they were.

Originally, the crowd were all enjoying the natural energies present. They all used their respective methods to train, and no one provoked anyone else.

However, soon, a change occurred to the palace hall.

Bodies of light that looked like fireflies started to appear from time to time.

When the crowd swallowed those bodies of light, they would not only obtain a great amount of natural energies, but they might also gain martial comprehension.

That... invoked the crowd’s greed!!!
