Chapter 5961: The Sacred Mansion’s Means

Weng!

Jie Tian formed a hand seal and manifested a concealment formation. However, he only enveloped around ten people in the vicinity in the concealment formation.

Including Ling Mouzi, they were important figures in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Ling Mouzi and the others quietly waited for Jie Tian to speak.

Jie Tian looked at Ling Mouzi and asked, “Lord Saint-tier Elder, you should know about our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s formation in this realm?”

“Young master Jie Tian, you’re referring to?” Ling Mouzi wasn’t sure what Jie Tian was referring to, so he sent a voice transmission to seek clarification. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“The sealing formation.”

“Yes, I’m aware of it.” Ling Mouzi nodded.

“Can you activate it?”

“I do, but...” Ling Mouzi hesitated.

“You’re worried about failure?”

“Young master Jie Tian, we must capture Chu Feng, but the sealing formation we constructed here is just a backup measure. Chu Feng has the death immunity token—and that is the means of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect—so I fear that our sealing formation might not work on him. I don’t think we should squander our sealing formation...”

Jie Tian chuckled at Ling Mouzi’s words. “In the end, you still fear failure. I understand that you, as a Saint-tier elder, have many considerations. Why don’t you let me call the shots for this?”

Jie Tian took out a token.

Ling Mouzi and the other elders were stunned. They recognized the token—it was used to channel the sealing formation they had constructed around this remnant. Furthermore, the token carried the words ‘Mansion Master’.

Jie Tian had received this token from Jie Tianran.

“Activate the formation. I was the one who called the shots, so I’ll take responsibility if anything happens.”

Weng!

Jie Tian began channeling the token.

Boom!

The earth trembled. The crowd was alarmed, not knowing what was happening.

The sealing formation didn’t manifest corporeally, making it seem as if nothing had happened.

However, the token that Jie Tian used to channel the formation released a small formation. The formation was a map, and it was centered around the remnant city they were in. It extended beyond the remnant and covered a vast area outside too.

Jie Tian formed a hand seal, and a formation core appeared. He channeled his bloodline power into the formation core.

The formation map began to expand.

“Could it be...?”

Even Ling Mouzi was stunned. He could tell that Jie Tian was using his bloodline power to expand the sealing formation.

“Don’t worry. My grandfather modified the formation so that I can control it with my bloodline,” Jie Tian explained to the astounded crowd.

However, the speed of expansion was still too fast. Jie Tian might be an inheritor of the Ruler’s Bloodline, but he was still a God-cloak World Spiritist.

Ling Mouzi and the others couldn’t help but be worried that he couldn’t withstand the sealing formation, knowing how powerful it was.

Jie Tian’s complexion did turn awful, but he endured it. Soon, the formation map in his grasp encompassed the entire realm.

However, by the end of it, he started retching from overexertion. He tried his best to hold it in, but a trail of blood still seeped from the corner of his mouth. Fortunately, that seemed to be all.

“Young master Jie Tian, are you fine?” Ling Mouzi and the others were worried.

“I’m fine.”

Jie Tian wiped off the blood. He looked gleeful despite having sustained some internal injuries from channeling the sealing formation. This was the outcome he wanted.

It was a formidable feat to expand the sealing formation to envelop the entire realm. Even his grandfather would praise him when he learned about this.

Losing to Chu Feng hurt his pride, but if he could capture Chu Feng after the latter cleared the remnant, that would be a massive contribution to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“That death immunity token might allow him to escape from this remnant, but I don’t believe that it’ll help him escape from this realm.”

Jie Tian touched the wound Chu Feng had inflicted on him earlier with his left hand. It left a bloodstain on his finger.

The eyes of Ling Mouzi and the others lit up. There was a formation inside the blood, and it had trapped a whiff of aura—Chu Feng’s aura.

JIe Tian smeared the blood on the formation. Moments later, a small dot appeared on Jie Tian’s formation map. The small dot was inside the remnant and was continuously advancing deeper.

“He really entered the remnant.”

It was obvious that the red dot represented Chu Feng on the map.

“I do hope that Chu Feng successfully clears this remnant,” Jie Tian remarked.

“Young master Jie Tian, did you let him hurt you on purpose?” Ling Mouzi asked.

“That’s right. I was worried he would flee out of fear. We need him to do his job here,” Jie Tian replied gleefully.

He had intentionally provoked Chu Feng earlier to use him to clear this remnant.

“Young master Jie Tian, why don’t we activate all our means here?” Ling Mouzi suggested.

“Did our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion leave behind other means here?” Jie Tian asked.

“We did.” Ling Mouzi nodded. He relayed the details to Jie Tian via voice transmission.

“Oh?” Jie Tian nodded in satisfaction. “Interesting. That might work better. Activate them. It’s time to show Chu Feng what our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is capable of. Otherwise, he might think that we can’t do anything about him.”

Glee, hostility, and anger were reflected in Jie Tian’s eyes. How could he not be angry after losing to Chu Feng in public? He had to be the final victor here, or else he would always play second fiddle to Chu Feng.
