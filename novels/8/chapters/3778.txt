Chapter 3778 - A Sheep’s Threat

It was precisely because of that unwritten rule that Chu Feng came to the conclusion that the person who had saved him was most likely not an ordinary villager.

Instead, that person must be a villager with a certain amount of strength. Otherwise, that person couldn’t possibly construct such a sumptuous palace in such a plain and simple village without any opposition.

“Young man, you’ve awakened?”

As Chu Feng was lost in thought, an extremely kind-sounding voice sounded from behind him.

Turning around, Chu Feng discovered that a middle-aged lady was looking at him. That middle-aged lady was about the same age as Song Ge’s mother, only over a thousand years old.

However, that middle-aged lady appeared much younger than Song Ge’s mother. She had a rosy complexion, and there were very few wrinkles on her face.

It could be seen that the middle-aged lady not only enjoyed a decent life, but her body was also in very good health.

“Senior, were you the one who saved me?” asked Chu Feng.

“What’s with the senior? I couldn’t possibly assume such an honor. You can address me as Aunty Liu, that’s what all the villagers here call me,” Aunty Liu said with a beaming smile.

“Thank you for saving me, Aunty Liu." Chu Feng clasped his fist respectfully as a sign of gratitude.

Although he knew that he would have been fine even if Aunty Liu hadn’t saved him, not everyone would be willing to save a stranger.

The fact that Aunty Liu was willing to save him served to show that she was a very kind-hearted person.

“Are you leaving already? How about staying for a meal before leaving?” suggested Aunty Liu.

“Aunty Liu, there’s no need for that. I still have something that I need to do," said Chu Feng.

“If what you’re planning to do is not urgent, stay for the meal. I’ve prepared the meal especially for you," Aunty Liu spoke with great enthusiasm.

Hearing the word ‘especially,’ Chu Feng felt emotionally moved.

Thus, he agreed to stay.

Shortly after entering the palace again, Chu Feng could smell a fragrant aroma.

It was an aroma that he had not felt in a very long time.

After reaching Chu Feng’s cultivation, eating, drinking and sleeping were all no longer important.

Unless it was due to some special circumstances, they would not feel hungry, thirsty or sleepy.

Eating was no longer essential for cultivators like Chu Feng. Even if they decided to eat, it would only be because they felt like sampling the food. They would only take several bites, and not fill their stomachs.

At that moment, Chu Feng actually felt a craving for the food.

The reason for that was because the aroma of Aunty Liu’s food was very distinctive.

It was the aroma of home. It was a smell that Chu Feng was only able to smell back in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm’s Nine Provinces Continent’s Chu Family.

After being seated, Chu Feng discovered that Aunty Liu had truly exerted a great amount of effort.

She had actually made eight different dishes. There was chicken, duck, fish and beef.

This touched Chu Feng even more. They were merely strangers who had come across one another by chance. Yet, Aunty Liu was willing to treat him so well. This was truly a rare occurrence.

Whilst eating, Chu Feng began to chat with Aunty Liu. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Chu Feng learned from her that even though she was an ordinary villager, her daughter was not.

Her daughter was named Wang Lian.

Not long after Wang Lian was born, her father died after being implicated by the energy ripples of a battle between martial cultivators that he was observing.

Thus, Wang Lian was raised by Aunty Liu alone.

Fortunately, Wang Lian did not fail to live up to Aunty Liu’s expectations. She had an outstanding talent for martial cultivation, and was already a peak True Immortal-level expert at the young age of three hundred and thirteen. Furthermore, she was now an elder of the Void Cleanse Monastery.

Although her achievements were nothing to be proud of for someone like Chu Feng, Wang Lian was a top genius in the eyes of the villagers, and even the Void Cleanse Monastery.

In fact, if Wang Lian were placed in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, she would still be deemed as a genius with her cultivation at her age.

Unfortunately, this place was the Reincarnation Upper Realm...

Out of filial piety, Wang Lian had wanted to bring Aunty Liu over to where she lived.

However, Aunty Liu insisted on staying in the village, and told Wang Lian that she was already used to staying there.

Because of that, Wang Lian decided to construct a palace for Aunty Liu to live in.

Originally, Aunty Liu was against it. However, after Wang Lian insisted, Aunty Liu decided to agree to it.

Aunty Liu did not wish to show off because she was afraid that the other villagers would hold grudges against her. However, to her surprise, not a single villager dared to voice any complaint.

As Aunty Liu told Chu Feng these things, she revealed a bitter smile.

Seeing that bitter smile, Chu Feng knew that the villagers were definitely not good people that felt happy for her.

In the past, they must’ve definitely bullied her.

Why would no one dare to say anything about Aunty Liu after such an extravagant palace was constructed for her in the village?

Naturally, it would be because Aunty Liu’s daughter Wang Lian was an elder of the Void Cleanse Monastery. They were afraid of Wang Lian, and thus did not dare to anger Aunty Liu.

“Mother, I’ve returned.”

As Chu Feng and Aunty Liu chatted, a voice sounded from outside the palace.

Chu Feng turned toward the voice and saw that several people were walking in.

Those people were all from the Void Cleanse Monastery.

The person leading them was a young woman. Although her looks were rather ordinary, she had a slightly extraordinary air, and the cultivation of a peak True Immortal.

She was most definitely Aunty Liu’s daughter, Wang Lian.

As for the others, they all wore the same outfit. They were all disciples of the Void Cleanse Monastery.

They were currently carrying several large chests. Chu Feng was able to tell that the chests were filled with medicinal pellets and herbs that assisted with one’s cultivation.

Although they were not precious, they were definitely effective for someone of Aunty Liu’s level of cultivation.

They were likely resources Wang Lian wanted to give to Aunty Liu.

“Who is this?”

Wang Lian had arrived at the dinner table. Upon seeing Chu Feng, she immediately displayed a look of displeasure.

“I am Asura, it is my pleasure to meet you.”

Chu Feng immediately got up and bowed respectfully towards Wang Lian.

However, Wang Lian did not even bother to pay attention to Chu Feng. With slight complaint, she looked to Aunty Liu.

“Mother, how many times do I have to tell you? Don’t just bring any random person home.”

“Our Void Cleanse Monastery has very strict rules. I definitely will not break the rules and bring those trash into our monastery. When even the villagers here are a no-go, it’s definitely impossible for outsiders," said Wang Lian.

“Lian’er, don’t speak nonsense. This young man here did not come here seeking your help.”

Aunty Liu explained how she had encountered Chu Feng to Wang Lian.

“Humph, are people all this despicable nowadays? You actually deliberately made yourself appear like you were injured so that you could ‘accidentally’ encounter my mother and approach her." Wang Lian looked to Chu Feng with contempt.

She actually thought Chu Feng to be a despicable person, and felt that he had deliberately approached her mother with the intention of seeking her help.

Chu Feng truly did not know whether to laugh or cry at Wang Lian’s train of thought.

“Miss Wang, you’ve truly mistaken me,” he said with a smile.

However, Chu Feng’s courtesy was actually met with Wang Lian’s angry roar, "A despicable vile man like yourself is unqualified to speak with this young lady!”

“Scram immediately! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Had it been before, Chu Feng would definitely teach such an arrogant woman a slight lesson.

However, Aunty Liu was simply too kind-hearted of a person. Taking her into consideration, Chu Feng did not get angry.

“Aunty Liu, in that case, I will take my leave,” Chu Feng bid his farewell to Aunty Liu. Then, he left the palace.

“Do not let me see you again! If I see you again, I’ll cut off your legs!”

Right after Chu Feng left the palace, Wang Lian’s threatening voice sounded from inside.

Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.

How could a lion possibly take the threat of a sheep to heart?
