Chapter 5344: Quelling Suspicions With Absolute Strength

It was already too late by the time Zhou Zhi realized that it was a ploy. 

Even if a trick was involved, there was no question that young master Bai Yue had won the bet fair and square. Zhou Zhi could only accept the result and report this matter to his father.

Upon hearing about the matter, the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief flew into a rage and gave Zhou Zhi a harsh beating—something that hadn’t happened for many years. But what was done was done. What they had to do now was to find a way to get back their family heirloom.  

Thus, the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief and Zhou Zhi paid a visit to young master Bai Yue and offered to redeem their family heirloom with other treasures. 

However, the other party declared that what had been won on the gambling table couldn’t be redeemed. The only way for them to get the family heirloom back was to stake a treasure of equivalent value in another bet against him and win. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Alternatively, he would also return their family heirloom to them if Old Man Zhou personally paid him a visit and traded the treasure on the Unageing Peak for it.

There was no way Old Man Zhou could do that since he was in a coma, but even if not for that, they would have also kept the matter from him. This was the Zhou Clan’s family heirloom they were talking about, after all.

Young master Bai Yue was clearly making things difficult for them.

The truth was that Old Man Zhou had been the one propping up the Zhou Clan over the years. Now that Old Man Zhou was severely ill, many powers that were previously on close terms with the Zhou Clan had started to give them the cold shoulder. The Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t have many personal connections to tap on either.

Cornered, the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief could only engage the help of the world spiritists visiting the Unageing Peak, specifically the White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists among them.

So, he activated Old Man Zhou’s protection formation to seal off the Unageing Peak, demanding that those who wanted to try awakening the treasure would have to win their Zhou Clan’s family heirloom back for them first.  

Of course, they couldn’t carelessly make a bet with young master Bai Yue since they would have to stake something of equivalent value to their family heirloom, thus they had to make sure to recruit only the highly-skilled White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists.

For that, the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief brought out the formation Old Man Zhou had passed down to them for training purposes. He figured that anyone who could decipher that formation should stand a good chance against young master Bai Yue. 

It was just that none of the White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists they had approached thus far were able to decipher the formation. 

Young master Bai Yue had stated a clear deadline. If they failed to challenge him by the deadline, he wouldn’t return the family heirloom to them anymore. 

Seeing that the deadline was about to be up, the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief had no choice but to invest some money in hiring a relatively well-known White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist to compete with young master Bai Yue. To further raise their morale, he took all of their clansmen and called his friends over to witness the bet. 

Only Zhou Yi was left on the Unageing Peak to take care of Old Man Zhou.

“You’re saying that I’ll have to help your Zhou Clan win your family heirloom back before you’ll open the protection formation and allow me to try awakening the treasure?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young master Chu Feng, I know what we’re doing goes against my grandfather’s will, but my father has his own difficulties too. As long as you’re willing to help us, regardless of whether things work out or not, I’ll convince my father to allow you to enter the Unageing Peak,” Zhou Yi spoke with a pleading tone.

“Do you know where your father and your younger brother are?” Chu Feng asked.

“I do,” Zhou Yi replied.

“Draw it out on a map.”

Zhou Yi did as she was told. 

Chu Feng glanced at the map and asked, “Miss Zhou, is it convenient for you to come with me?”

“Yes, it’s convenient,” Zhou Yi replied with a nod.

Shoosh!

By the time she said those words, she had already been brought out of the palace and was traveling at a speed so fast that she couldn’t clearly see the scenery passing her by. 

Chu Feng had grabbed her and was pulling her along with him.

She turned to look at Chu Feng, only to see lightning crackling around him. Much to her shock, he had activated his bloodline power and raised his cultivation to rank four Half-God level. The Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor were one thing, but she seriously doubted her eyes when she saw his Lightning Wings.

There is actually someone who can utilize the Lightning Wings at Half-God level?

“Young master Chu Feng… are you really a junior?” Zhou Yi asked in shock.

“Yes, I am a junior,” Chu Feng replied.

“If I may ask, young master Chu Feng, what’s your background?” Zhou Yi asked fearfully.

She was afraid of Chu Feng and his backing. Only a formidable power could possibly nurture such a powerful junior. She was worried that Chu Feng would harbor anger toward their Zhou Clan for exploiting him. 

That could spell their Zhou Clan’s doom.

“I don’t have any formidable backing. Also, your Zhou Clan is free to decide what you want to do with your own treasures,” Chu Feng addressed her concerns, knowing what she was worried about. 

“Young master Chu Feng, it’s rare to meet people as understanding as you are,” Zhou Yi replied.

Chu Feng simply chuckled at those words.

“That lass really doesn’t know you. It must be because this Upper Realm is too remote. To think that they haven’t heard of the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator of the Totem Galaxy!” Eggy remarked. 

“Milady Queen, you should stop teasing me. That title of mine hardly means anything to the powerhouses of the Totem Galaxy,” Chu Feng replied.

“They are fools for underestimating you. Anyone with any brain should be able to tell that you harness unimaginable potential inside. What a pity that there are far too many fools in your world of cultivation.” Eggy clicked her tongue.

Chu Feng responded to those words with a smile.

Soon, Chu Feng spotted a group of people resting along the way. Taking a closer look, he noticed that they were from the Zhou Clan. Thus, he reverted his cultivation back to rank one Half-God level before descending together with Zhou Yi. 

Zhou Yi took the lead and brought Chu Feng into one of the war chariots, where the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief was resting. 

There were two other people inside the war chariot. 

One of them was a junior like Chu Feng. Needless to say, he was the culprit who had lost the Zhou Clan’s family heirloom, Zhou Zhi. 

The other one was a beautiful woman, though Chu Feng could tell that she was centuries older than Zhou Yi, and her original appearance was plain-looking. She had altered her appearance using her spirit power to make herself look beautiful. 

“What are you doing here? Didn’t I tell you to stay at the Unageing Peak? Also, who is he?” the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief asked lividly.

From the agitated look on his face, it was clear that they were discussing something important. Zhou Yi’s untimely visit with an outsider only further fanned his fury.  

“Father, this young master over here is Chu Feng. He can represent our Zhou Clan for the bet,” Zhou Yi got straight to the point. 

“Him?” The Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief frowned in skepticism. “But this young friend here appears to be a junior?”

“Yes, young master Chu Feng is indeed a junior, but…” 

Zhou Yi wanted to explain the matter, but the woman with an altered appearance interjected before she could finish her sentence.

“Third Sister, why are you causing trouble at this critical time? Didn’t our father tell you to stay at home? Why did you run all the way here?”

It went without saying that this woman was Zhou Yi’s second sister, Zhou Shuang.

“Second Sister, young master Chu Feng is an outstanding world spiritist. He can represent our Zhou Clan for the duel,” Zhou Yi said.

“Represent our Zhou Clan for the duel? Third Sister, don’t you know how much effort it took me to invite Master Liu over? You shouldn’t cause me additional trouble here,” Zhou Shuang said in displeasure.

“Second Sister, based on what I know, Master Liu couldn’t decipher our grandfather’s formation, right?” Zhou Yi asked.

“You’re right, but so what? Is there any better candidate than him?” Zhou Shuang asked.

“This young master was able to do it,” Zhou Yi pointed to Chu Feng and said.

“What?” The Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief and Zhou Shuang were taken aback. They turned their gazes toward Chu Feng.

“Heh…” A sneer suddenly sounded. It was from Zhou Zhi.

“Second Sister, what nonsense are you spouting? Even I was unable to decipher our grandfather’s formation. There’s no way he can possibly do it!” Zhou Zhi snorted.

He found it hard to believe that there was a world spiritist of his age group who was better than him. 

“If you’re that formidable, how did you end up losing your Zhou Clan’s treasure?” Chu Feng suddenly spoke up. He looked at Zhou Zhi as if he was half-witted.

Zhou Zhi was angered by Chu Feng’s words.

“What do you mean by that? Who do you think you are to criticize me?” Zhou Zhi roared at Chu Feng.

“I’m not in a good mood right now. Don’t test my patience, or else I won’t go easy on you,” Chu Feng said. 

“How arrogant. Second Sister, where did you find this fool from?” Zhou Zhi roared.

Pah!

Zhou Zhi was silenced by a slap. It was inflicted by the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Shut your mouth! We wouldn’t be in this mess if not for you!” the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief bellowed. 

Zhou Zhi was clearly afraid of his father. He immediately zipped up his mouth, although that didn’t hinder him from glaring at Chu Feng.

“This young master over here, did you really decipher that formation?” the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Yes, I did,” Chu Feng replied.

“May I know what your current level of spirit power is?” 

“White Dragon God-cloak.”

Pu!

Scornful laughter echoed from Zhou Shuang and Zhou Zhi as soon as he spoke those words. They didn’t believe that Chu Feng was a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.

Even the Zhou Clan’s Clan Chief also revealed a look of doubt.

Chu Feng didn’t bother arguing his case. All he did was lift his palm and release a wisp of his spirit power. The energy harnessed inside the wisp of spirit power naturally shocked everyone, except for Chu Feng himself and Zhou Yi.
