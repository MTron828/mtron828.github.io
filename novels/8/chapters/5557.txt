Chapter 5557: Xianhai Yu’er Appears

“I have always been under the effect of the evil power all this while. It’s so frightening that I don’t know if I’ll be able to remain loyal to the Star Sea Realm.”

Chu Feng immediately understood what Chief Elder 333 was getting at. It was not that the latter trusted Chu Feng, but that he didn’t trust his future self. He had only excused himself lest he leak the secret of Xianhai Yu’er bloodline.

“Is there no way to stop it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I have reported the matter to the primal elder, but he’s unable to do anything about it. In fact, even the primal elder is being affected by the evil power too,” Chief Elder 333 said.

“Even the primal elder is also…” Chu Feng finally realized the severity of the issue.

The primal elder was the strongest person in this realm, the person truly in charge. The Star Sea Realm was doomed if he ever succumbed to the evil power.

“You need not worry about the primal elder. That evil power isn’t strong enough to shake him,” Chief Elder 333 clarified. “I was confident that I could remain unfazed by the evil power, but the evil power suddenly grew stronger a few days ago, so much that I can’t say the same anymore.”

“There must be a way out,” Chu Feng said.

Chief Elder 333 suddenly smiled. It was a smile of helplessness, but at the same time, he looked heartened as well.

“Our Star Sea Realm is in a precarious position. Our hope lies with Xianhai Yu’er and Jie Tian. Even though you can’t help Xianhai Yu’er anymore, you should still give it your all in your new position. You’re also contributing to our Star Sea Realm by aiding Jie Tian,” Chief Elder 333 said.

“I will,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Still, you need to be additionally careful when dealing with Jie Tian. He’s a vicious individual. Under no circumstances should you defy him,” Chief Elder 333 said.

“Rest assured, elder. I’ll handle it well,” Chu Feng said.

With that, Chief Elder 333 finally brought Chu Feng out of the room.

Jie Tian immediately assessed Chu Feng from head to toe. This was the first time he had paid so much attention to an individual ever since arriving at the Star Sea Realm. A moment later, he asked, “Are you the one who modified Xianhai Yu’er’s formation armor?”

“It’s our shared credit,” Chu Feng replied.

Jie Tian harrumphed in disdain upon hearing those words, though it was directed not at Chu Feng but everyone else.

“I have inspected the formation armor. Many people contributed to its modification, but there’s a single person at the center of it, overseeing all of the changes. I have never seen such a supervising method from any of them before. You are the reason Xianhai Yu’er’s formation armor improved so much,” Jie Tian said.

Both Chu Feng and Chief Elder 333 were taken aback.

They thought that Jie Tian had come knocking because someone leaked information about Chu Feng, but from the looks of it, Jie Tian had figured everything out by himself.

“You deduced that there was a new engineer here through the changes in the formation armor?” Chief Elder 333 asked.

This was a formidable feat if that was really the case.

“What else?” Jie Tian replied.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Those two words verified Chu Feng and Chief Elder 333’s guess. Without a doubt, Jie Tian was indeed a frighteningly sharp and intelligent person.

“You can’t put your talent to full use here. Follow me. I can bring out your full potential,” Jie Tian said before turning around and leaving.

The emaciated elder quickly followed him, though he made sure to wrap Chu Feng with his spirit power and drag him along. Chu Feng was not given the privilege of choice here.

Shortly after they left, Chief Elder 333 glared at the chief engineer and questioned, “Why did you run your mouth? Do you know what kind of talent we have lost due to your loose lips?”

The chief engineer was terrified, but he tried to explain himself, “L-lord Chief Elder, I only did as I was told. I can’t possibly lie to Lord Jie Tian. That’s against the rules of our Star Sea Realm!”

“Y-you…” Chief Elder 333 was infuriated by his response, but he couldn’t argue against that.

First and foremost, the chief engineer was a talented too despite being inferior to Chu Feng. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been tasked with such an important role. It would be a huge loss to Xianhai Yu’er if he were to be stripped of his position.

Furthermore, the chief engineer had followed the rules here. Concealing the truth would have been the wrong thing to do, at least by the rules of the Star Sea Realm.

It was then that two figures flew over from the distance.

The eyes of the crowd lit up, especially the younger men, whose eyes were practically bulging.

One of the figures was the female chief elder who collected Xianhai Yu’er’s formation armor earlier, and the other one was a ravishing young lady dressed in a green dress.

The young lady had long black hair that swayed gracefully with her movements. Her long eyelashes fluttered ever so slightly before the wind. Her clear eyes twinkled brightly as if reflecting a universe of stars. Her tall nose bridge and cherry lips further complemented her beauty.

All of these were put together by her pure disposition, making her resemble a fairy from the high heaven. Perfection didn’t seem to be a stretch of a word when used on her.

Her body was amazing as well. Her snowy skin carried a warm red tinge, giving rise to a beautiful translucent quality reminiscent of the highest-quality jade. Her green dress only further complemented her features.

It felt like someone like her could have only existed in dreams and not in the real world. Yet, here was one, standing before everyone’s eyes. Many in the crowd began drooling.

“Aren’t you going to pay respects to Lord Xianhai Yu’er?” the female chief elder asked.

Everyone in the crowd, with the exception of Chief Elder 333, quickly bowed to Xianhai Yu’er.

“You may spare the formalities. I have come here to thank you. You have worked hard maintaining my formation armor,” Xianhai Yu’er said with a sweet smile, forming a stark contrast to the cold and lofty Jie Tian.

Flattered, the crowd found themselves at a loss of words.

The female chief elder proceeded to reveal the reason behind their visit. It turned out that Xianhai Yu’er’s formation armor was significantly stronger than before, so the two of them came here to reward them.

“Lord Xianhai Yu’er, we’re only doing what we should.”

“Indeed. We’re only doing our job!”

The chief engineer and the others hurriedly exclaimed upon learning the reason behind her visit. Some of their faces even reddened in embarrassment.

However, Chief Elder 333 poured a pail of cold water on their excitement.

“You need not thank them. They have nothing to do with the formation armor’s enhancement.”
