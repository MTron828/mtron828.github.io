Chapter 4604: No One Can Move Me

It was a barren world devoid of the concepts of sky and land. It was boundless at a single gaze, and the only thing that differentiated one place from another was the different shades of red they were in. The surroundings carried the overwhelming stench of blood, making it look even more eerie and horrifying.

However, Chu Feng’s attention was not on all these, for he had already noticed Song Yun standing not too far away.

However, she was surrounded by black aura, which manifested as tentacles to coil around her, entrapping her. The black aura seemed to be expanding with every single moment, allowing it to manifest even more tentacles to hold her firmly in place. Under the ravage of the tentacles, Song Yun could only scream in pain.

It was then that black aura began forming around Chu Feng too. Having seen Song Yun’s plight, he immediately dodged it, only to realize that the black aura was incredibly fast too. Not only was it impossible to avoid it, but he was unable to stop it either.

Even his spirit power couldn’t ward off the black aura.

In the end, the black aura successfully coiled itself around the helpless Chu Feng. Chu Feng was still able to move around, but he could feel that his energy was being swiftly absorbed by the black aura. As the black aura was being nourished and grew even larger, the rate of its absorption became faster and faster too.

“The Divine Rejuvenation Pearl is actually such a frightening treasure?” Chu Feng remarked with a deep frown.

Knowing that it was near impossible to break free of the black aura, he turned his sights to figuring out a way to leave this area. However, he was unable to discern a way to do so at all.

He turned his sights to Song Yun and saw that she was already close to going into a coma. He quickly rushed over to her side to hug her tightly, hoping to protect her with his own body. It was a helpless endeavor, nothing short of praying for a miracle, but amazingly, it worked.

The black aura continued manifesting and wrapped itself around Chu Feng, but Song Yun, who was protected in Chu Feng’s embrace, managed to escape the worst.

However, as the black aura grew and grew, the amount of energy that Chu Feng was losing at each second grew to a terrifying amount. He felt that he was soon going to be emptied out by this black aura.

At this rate, he would really lose his life here. However, he couldn’t figure a way out of this either. He was completely helpless here.

Soon, his weakened body couldn’t support his consciousness anymore, and he fell into a coma.

Song Yun had also already fallen unconscious by then.

“Marvelous! Such a marvelous taste this is! I’ve never thought that they would be so delicious!”

All of a sudden, a bizarre sound echoed in the space, and a black silhouette walked out from the crevices of space.

This silhouette was over a hundred meters tall, and it had an appearance reminiscent of a crab. However, it had over ten thousand tentacles dancing around its body. As it turned out, the black auras that had clinged onto Chu Feng and Song Yun earlier were its tentacles.

However, as compared to the auras before, this black silhouette had a corporeal body.

This monster had no eyes, and its body had nothing but a massive mouth that was filled with jagged scarlet teeth. It swiftly squirmed over to where Chu Feng and Song Yun were with a widened mouth, hoping to devour the two of them.

However, just as it was about to end their lives, the unconscious Song Yun suddenly opened her eyes.

“You have finally shown yourself.”

Song Yun looked at the monster, the fear that was previously on her face gone without a trace. It was replaced with a sinister smile, reminiscent of a predator finally chancing upon its prey.

“You!!!”

Song Yun’s smile seemed to have brought a bout of realization to the monster. The latter immediately turned around to escape back into the crevices of space.

“Hmph!”

With a cold harrumph, Song Yun’s body suddenly vanished without a trace.

Before anyone could process it, she had already pierced right through the monster with her body, reminiscent of a sharp sword.

Wuuu!

Song Yun’s attack ripped a huge hole in the body of the monster. Green fluid began spraying all over the place as the cries of the monster echoed loudly within the space.

The monster swayed from left to right in uncertainty. It knew that it had to escape, but it was unable to figure out a feasible escape route.

“You knave! How dare you assault this Exalted?” the monster shrieked at Song Yun.

However, Song Yun didn’t pay any heed to it. Instead, she glanced at the item in her hand—a golden pearl.

Swoosh!

All of a sudden, the pearl in Song Yun’s hands released a terrifying suction force. The screams of the black monster immediately intensified as its body began to break apart to be sucked into the pearl.

Gahhh!

Before long, the black monster had been completely pulled into the golden pearl.

Song Yun swallowed the golden pearl down, and a mystical energy was released within her body. Instead of immersing herself in the happenings in her body, she quickly grabbed hold and Chu Feng and dashed into the crevices of space where the black monster had appeared from.

That was actually the exit of the world inside the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl.

When Chu Feng and Song Yun finally appeared once more, they had already returned back to the lush Incubation forest.

The ball of golden grass was still in the same position as before, but it had begun to wither swiftly, as if its life had come to an end.

Song Yun gently placed Chu Feng on the ground.

At this very moment, Chu Feng was incredibly frail, such that one could even mistake him for a dead man. His body had withered up like a dried corpse, and there was barely any blood and flesh left on his body anymore. All that was left was a thin layer of skin sticking to his bones.

Yet, Song Yun showed not the slightest hint of disdain despite the awful state Chu Feng was in. Instead, she felt something gnawing at her heart, leaving her touched yet bitter.

“It was all thanks to you that I was able to obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. You have done me such a huge favor; I can’t allow you to die like this.”

Song Yun’s appearance began to change, reverting back to her original appearance. Then, she lowered her head and, astonishingly, kissed Chu Feng.

Miraculously, shortly after Song Yun’s lips came into contact with Chu Feng’s, the latter’s withered body began recovering back to its original appearance. Flesh and blood swiftly regrew in his body, and his complexion regained its redness. Other than the fact that he was still unconscious, he appeared to be in a better state than before he entered the world inside the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl.

It was only after Chu Feng had finally recovered that Song Yun finally withdrew her lips.

She opened her mouth wide, and the golden pearl which she had obtained from the black monster earlier fell into her hands.

This golden pearl was currently pulsating with the same energy that was coursing through Chu Feng’s body at the moment. It was using the powers of this golden pearl that Song Yun managed to save him.

After saving Chu Feng, she didn’t wake him up right away. Instead, she sat obediently by his side and gently stroked his cheeks with her fair hands.

“I thought that there was no one in the world who could move my heart, until the day I met you.”

As Song Yun gazed at Chu Feng, a rare surge of warmth appeared in her clear eyes.

“Aiyoyo, what did I stumble upon here? Isn’t this the legendary Divine Rejuvenation Pearl? Woah, and there’s even a delectable beauty here too!”

It was then that a voice suddenly sounded behind Song Yun.

It was Yin Tianchou!!!

“This fellow is more formidable than I thought. I didn’t think that he would actually be able to obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. I heard that the world inside the pearl is incredibly terrifying, such that none of those who ventured in were able to return with their lives. Even the Wretched Demon was unable to do anything about it, yet you managed to obtain it.

“If I’m not mistaken, it must be that fellow’s credit, right? Looks like he does have some capability!”

Yin Tianchou looked at Chu Feng as he spoke.

“How did you find this place?”

Song Yun turned around and looked at Yin Tianchou.

The latter raised his hand casually, and with a ‘swoosh’, an object that Chu Feng was carrying flew right into Yin Tianchou’s hands. It was a silver bowl.

“That fellow must have thought that he has won that duel earlier, but he didn’t know that I intentionally left this treasure back there for him to take. This treasure is already contracted with me, so I’m able to sense its presence as long as I’m not too far away from it.

“I was intending to find an opportunity to teach this fellow a lesson, but who could have thought that I would be so lucky as to stumble upon such a fortuitous encounter?” Yin Tianchou said with a smile as his eyes narrowed in greed.

“You want to steal the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl from me?”

Song Yun casually fiddled with the golden pearl in her hand as she asked.

“No no no, I’m not interested in treasures at all. The fortuitous encounter I’m referring to is you, young miss.”

Yin Tianchou licked his lips licentiously. It looked like a fox stumbling upon a plump, white rabbit, and he was so excited that it looked almost as if saliva would dribble out of his mouth.

“Is that so?”

Despite Yin Tianchou’s words, Song Yun showed no sign of unease. Instead, a slight smile crept onto her young and beautiful face.

That slight smile caused Yin Tianchou to recoil a little. He couldn’t really understand what it was, but for some reason, Song Yun’s smile left him feeling a little uneasy.
