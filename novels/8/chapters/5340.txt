Chapter 5340: The Cold Senior Uncle

Chapter 5340: The Cold Senior Uncle

Upon stepping out of the Ancient Realm, Chu Feng was transported to the realm he had been in prior to entering the Ancient Realm. It was crowded when he first arrived here, but there was not a single person to be seen now.

Chu Feng wasn’t surprised in the least. He knew that they must have been scared off after seeing the army of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace. It was just that he didn’t expect the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect to have escaped that quickly too.

Chu Feng constructed a formation and invoked it on Bai Yunqing. The latter quickly regained consciousness.

“Big brother Chu Feng? Y-you’re fine! How did you recover so quickly? It can’t be that we’re all dead, are we? But why does this place look so familiar?” Bai Yunqing quickly scanned his surroundings upon regaining consciousness. 

The people of the Ancient Realm had treated his injuries that day after he passed out, but he had remained unconscious since then. Due to that, his memories were still stuck at the moment when the Bluemoon Sacred Palace was still invading the Ancient Realm.

“We’re alive,” Chu Feng replied. 

He quickly filled Bai Yunqing on the details about what had happened in the Ancient Realm. However, he only told him that Little Crescent was a hidden expert from the Ancient Realm, and she was the one who destroyed the Bluemoon Sacred Palace. He left out the part about Little Crescent making use of him and the trial he went through in the boundless space.

“Holy crap! Was Little Crescent that amazing of a person? I thought that she was just a little kiddo! In any case, it’s great to know that the Bluemoon Sacred Palace suffered retribution. They were really obnoxious, especially that nasty old man!”

Bai Yunqing was shocked to learn about what had happened. Who could have possibly thought that Little Crescent was such an amazing individual? He was also overjoyed to hear that the Bluemoon Sacred Palace and Yuan Jiang had been obliterated from the face of the world.

However, when he noticed the missing smile on Chu Feng’s face, he suddenly remembered something and lowered his head sorrowfully. “Big brother, I know that you’re upset, and the living has to move on. My deepest condolences.”

Eggy was displeased to hear those words. “Condolences? What does he mean by that? Chu Feng, open the world spirit gate!” 

Chu Feng did as he was told, and Eggy immediately rushed out.

“Bai Yunqing, this Queen is still well and alive. Shut your trap!” she lambasted him before returning to the World Spirit Space. 

Eggy taking the effort to come out and berate Bai Yunqing actually showed that she had a good impression of him. After all, Bai Yunqing could have sided with the Bluemoon Sacred Palace to survive the ordeal, but he chose to stick with Chu Feng. He even scolded the Bluemoon Sacred Palace for her. That changed her impression of him.

“Waaa, that young miss is still alive. This is great news! But she doesn’t seem to be in a good condition,” Bai Yunqing remarked.

“Indeed.” Chu Feng nodded in agreement.

“Big brother, what do you plan to do next?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“I’m thinking of heading to the Immortal Sea Galaxy,” Chu Feng replied.

Eggy became agitated when she heard those words.

“Chu Feng, why are you going to the Immortal Sea Galaxy? I forbid it! I won’t talk to you if you dare head there!” 

She knew that Chu Feng was going there to ask Xianhai Shaoyu for help. Thus far, Chu Feng had always insisted on solving his problems by himself, but he was changing his principles now for her sake. She didn’t like that. 

“Eggy…” Chu Feng tried to persuade her. 

He was truly worried about Eggy, or else he wouldn’t have pleaded with Little Crescent earlier. Eggy’s unstable state worried him, and he was afraid that the slightest carelessness might result in their eternal separation. Thus, he wanted to grasp onto any chances to heal her. 

However, Eggy obstinately shook her head and said, “Say no more. I disallow it!”

That put Chu Feng at a loss.

“Big brother, why do you want to go to the Immortal Sea Galaxy? Is there something there that may possibly help the young miss to recover from her condition?” Bai Yunqing asked.

Knowing that Chu Feng was someone who cared about his friends, he deduced that Chu Feng’s next destination was somewhere that could potentially treat Eggy’s condition. 

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

“How confident are you of it working out?” 

“Honestly, not very much.” Chu Feng shook his head.

Eggy’s condition was extremely severe; Chu Feng could tell as much as a world spiritist. 

The Immortal Sea Clan was powerful, but they weren’t adept in world spiritist techniques, not to mention that Chu Feng didn’t even know whether Xianhai Shaoyu was there or not. It could end up as a wasted trip. 

“If you aren’t too sure about it, I do have an alternate idea,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Brother Bai, what do you suggest?” Chu Feng asked.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“My master isn’t just the strongest world spiritist in the Totem Galaxy; he’s able to stand his ground against the other top world spiritists in the vast world of cultivation too. Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has tried to recruit my master before. 

“Big brother, you should also know that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is filled with a bunch of conservative old fogeys. They have formidable world spiritists, but they are divided into many factions and are extremely hostile toward outsiders. In particular, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has displayed strong inclination to withhold all resources for its own people. It’s not easy to join the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and only the cream of the crop would receive an invitation from them.

“I can tell you for certain that my master lives up to his reputation. What’s even more impressive is that he’s an all-rounder. Be it offense formations, defense formations, or recovery formations, he’s adept in all of them!” Bai Yunqing said.

“Is… your master willing to help me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Well, my master rarely does favors for others, but you should know who’s standing before you. I am his disciple, after all! You have nothing to fear now that I’m on your side!” Bai Yunqing said. 

“I’ll be counting on you then, Brother Bai.” 

Chu Feng could see a glimmer of hope in this proposal. The First Guest Elder of the Totem Dragon Clan couldn’t possibly be anyone ordinary.

The two of them immediately set off for where Bai Yunqing’s master was currently residing. 

Even though Bai Yunqing’s master was the Totem Dragon Clan’s First Elder, he didn’t usually reside in the Totem Dragon Clan unless there were urgent matters that required his attention. 

After days of traveling, the two of them arrived in one of the Totem Galaxy’s Ordinary Realms. There was a mysterious mountain manor here that ruled over the entire realm. No one knew who was the master of this mysterious mountain manor, but according to Bai Yunqing, it was none other than his master, Taishi Xingzhong. 

The mountain manor that was currently standing before Chu Feng was covered in a powerful formation that prevented him from peering in. From this formation itself, it was clear that Bai Yunqing’s master lived up to his reputation. 

“Big brother Chu Feng, wait here for me. I’ll give a heads-up to my master first before bringing you in.” Bai Yunqing’s attitude became much more uptight upon arriving here. He was extremely respectful toward his master, and his master appeared to have high expectations of him too.

“Go ahead. I’ll wait here for you,” Chu Feng replied.

Bai Yunqing entered the mountain manor, but as soon as he passed through the entrance, a white-haired elder suddenly descended before him. This elder was blind in one eye, and his face was covered in scars. He was dressed in ordinary clothes, but he commanded an air of intimidation. 

“Who’s that fellow outside?” the one-eyed elder asked coldly.

“Paying respects to senior uncle.” Bai Yunqing bowed to the one-eyed elder before introducing Chu Feng. “He is Chu Feng. Senior uncle, you should have heard of him. He’s the one who won the Trial of the Strongest’s late Martial Exalted level category a while back.”

The one-eyed elder glanced at Chu Feng, but his gaze showed that he didn’t think much about Chu Feng’s title.

“Why did you bring him here?” the one-eyed elder asked.

“Senior uncle, many things happened during my trip to the Ancient Realm. He was the one who saved my life,” Bai Yunqing began explaining.

“Get straight to the point,” the one-eyed elder replied impatiently. He didn’t care what Bai Yunqing had been through. 

Bai Yunqing also seemed to be accustomed to the one-eyed elder’s cold attitude.

“Senior uncle, his world spirit is severely injured. I’d like to ask my master to treat her,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Your master has more important things to do. He doesn’t have the time to bother with such trivialities. Besides, it’s only a mere world spirit. If it dies, so be it. There’s no need to treat it,” the one-eyed elder replied.

“Senior uncle, that world spirit is extremely important to Chu Feng. If my master isn’t free, could you take a look at her instead? I already promised him that my master would help him with this,” Bai Yunqing said.

“Didn’t your master often tell you not to get involved in the affairs of others? Have your years of teaching gone in vain?” The one-eyed elder glared at Bai Yunqing with furious eyes.

Bai Yunqing kneeled on the ground and said, “Senior uncle, I hold master and senior uncle’s teachings to heart, but Chu Feng is really different. I owe him a debt for saving my life. I’m begging you, please take a look at his world spirit.”

This was the first time in many years Bai Yunqing had brought an outsider to his master, as well as the first time he was begging his senior uncle for a favor. 

All of a sudden, the one-eyed elder recalled something, and he spoke with a much gentler tone, “Yunqing, it’s about time. Are you done preparing yet?”

Bai Yunqing shuddered upon hearing those words. Fear flickered across his eyes, but he still answered the question, “Senior uncle, Yunqing has been paying close attention to it at all times. I have been working hard in my preparations.”

“Very well.” The one-eyed elder nodded his head in satisfaction. “Follow me.”

The one-eyed elder made his way out of the mountain manor, where Chu Feng was waiting.

“Chu Feng, this is my senior uncle. He’s a True Dragon World Spiritist. Senior uncle, this is Chu Feng.” Bai Yunqing introduced the two of them to each other. 

“Young friend Chu Feng, I’ll have a look at your world spirit,” the one-eyed elder said.

Chu Feng opened his world spirit gate and brought Eggy out. The one-eyed elder frowned upon seeing Eggy.

“Did your world spirit ignite her life force using a forbidden skill?” the one-eyed elder asked.

“Yes, elder,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young friend, what’s your request? Do you want me to further stabilize her condition?” the one-eyed elder asked.

“I want her to make a full recovery without suffering from any side effects,” Chu Feng replied.

The one-eyed elder shook his head upon hearing those words.

“I shan’t beat around the bush since you’re Yunqing’s close friend. It’s already a miracle that your world spirit is able to survive in such a condition. It’s almost impossible for her to make a full recovery. Neither I nor Yunqing’s master will be able to do it. 

“There might still be a sliver of hope if you bring her to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but you’ll have to pay an exorbitant price for that. It’s unlikely that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion will do you this favor,” the one-eyed elder said.
