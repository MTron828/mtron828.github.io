MGA: Chapter 1641 - Bunch Of Mobs

The buildings of the Nangong Imperial Clan were all bestowed with special spirit formations. Thus, not only were they made out of dazzling gold, they were also indestructibly strong.

However, it was precisely these buildings that were completely shattered by a single footstep from the Asura Evil Spirit. Not even bits of the buildings remained standing.

“Exactly what is going on?! What is that? Provide me with an explanation right now!” The Nangong Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief Nangong Beidou was standing on the surveying platform. He looked to Nangong Rongsheng, who was kneeling before him, and questioned him with a cold voice.

“It’s Chu Feng, that monster is Chu Feng transformed. Chu Feng is simply not a human at all. He is a monster. Nangong Huayi was killed by him with a single strike,” At this moment, Nangong Rongsheng’s body was shivering. His shivering was even more intense than before.

He had seen with his own eyes the birth of the Asura Evil Spirit, and how it had killed Nangong Huayi with a single strike. He was truly frightened by it.

“That brat actually possessed this sort of ability?!”

Hearing those words, Nangong Beidou’s complexion turned green. As he looked to the dark black gaseous flames that formed the enormous humanoid monster that stood with legs on the ground and head reaching the clouds that the twelve Martial Emperors and thousands of Half Martial Emperors were unable to stop, Nangong Beidou began to feel regret.

He regretted his decision to remove Chu Feng so hastily. In the end, he had brought forth a great calamity. Today, the Nangong Imperial Clan would likely suffer a great disaster. It would be fortunate if they could survive the disaster. However, if they failed to live past it, then the foundation of the Nangong Imperial Clan that had been continued for several tens of thousands of years would likely be destroyed.

“Lord Clan Chief, what should we do? What can we do right now?” Even though he was a Martial Emperor, Nangong Rongsheng was actually so scared that he started shedding tears. It could be seen how deeply shocked he was.

“What a disgrace! What else can we do? We will naturally have to kill him!”

“Look at your appearance, it seems like you are unable to battle. Do not wail before me. Go and protect the princes and princess so that they can safely escape the city,” Nangong Beidou said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Yes,” Nangong Rongsheng did not hesitate. His body moved, and he immediately left the surveying tower. To him, not having to fight the Asura Evil Spirit was an enormous blessing.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at this moment, an abnormally ear-piercing explosion sounded. The Golden Dragon Grand Formation, which had been set up through the joint efforts of twelve Martial Emperors and several thousand Half Martial Emperors, was actually broken through by the Asura Evil Spirit.

Not only did the twelve golden dragons instantly crumble, there were also several hundred Half Martial Emperors who turned into nothing more than splashes of blood. Furthermore, two rank one Martial Emperors were grabbed by that Asura Evil Spirit and crushed to death in its hands.

Just like this, two Martial Emperors that possessed exceptionally powerful might were killed on the spot.

“Run away!”

In an instant, regardless of whether they were Martial Emperors or Half Martial Emperors, they all began to flee. The reason for that was because they knew very well that, without the protection of the formation, they were simply no match for that Asura Evil Spirit. If they were to stay here, the only thing waiting for them would be a slaughter.

。

Seeing this scene, killing intent emerged in Nangong Beidou’s eyes. He flipped his palms and took out a large fiery red blade and a blue spear.

They were two Incomplete Imperial Armaments. Even though they were Incomplete Imperial Armaments, they were no ordinary Incomplete Imperial Armaments. When the two of them were used simultaneously, their might would become even stronger.

“Woosh~~~”

Afterward, Nangong Beidou’s body moved. He disappeared from where he had previously been standing. When he reappeared, he was right in front of that Asura Evil Spirit. He had blocked the Asura Evil Spirit’s path.

While Nangong Beidou’s size was small, and he looked like a speck of dust when compared to the Asura Evil Spirit that was capable of supporting both heaven and earth, he possessed an exceptionally powerful aura. Judging from that, he did not appear to be weaker than the Asura Evil Spirit.

“Chu Feng? I don’t think you’re him. However, regardless of exactly what you are, you will not be able to take another step forward today,” Nangong Beidou said with a cold voice.

“Clan Chief Nangong, we have come to help you,” Right at this moment, White-browed Immortal arrived with his group of Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists.

“Brother White-brow, quickly withdraw yourselves. This monster is not something that you all can handle,” Nangong Beidou urged.

“Clan Chief Nangong, please rest assured. I have inspected it carefully. This guy here is an Evil Spirit. If I am not mistaken, it should be an Asura Spirit World’s Evil Spirit. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to possess such powerful fighting strength,” White-browed Immortal said.

“Asura Spirit World’s Evil Spirit?” Hearing those words, Nangong Beidou started to frown. He was even more shocked.

He clearly did not expect that the monster before him possessed such a great origin. After all, the legend of the Asura Spirit World was something that everyone had heard of. Right now, a living Asura World Spirit had actually appeared. Furthermore, it was an Evil Spirit on top of that. How could anyone not be shocked to hear this?

“It is indeed an Asura Spirit World’s Evil Spirit. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to be this powerful. However, do not worry. What Evil Spirits fear the most is the Evil Suppression Talisman. As you fight it, I will use Evil Suppression Talismans to handle it as well. With that, you will definitely be able to prevail over it,” White-browed Immortal said.

“Very well, let’s do it,” Nangong Beidou said.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

After Nangong Beidou said those words, White-browed Immortal and the others began to release Evil Suppression Talismans. Like ropes, the Evil Suppression Talismans joined together and began to twist themselves around that Asura Evil Spirit.

As for the Asura Evil Spirit, it stood there motionlessly. Not only did it not dodge, it did not fight back either. It was as if it were waiting for them to attack it.

Like this, the Evil Suppression Talismans began to twist around the Asura Evil Spirit’s body. Layer upon layer, the Evil Suppression Talismans covered it completely.

“Earthen Taboo: Fire Dragon King.”

“Earthen Taboo: Water Dragon King.”

At the same time, Nangong Beidou also unleashed his attacks. Regardless of whether it was the might or the domineering feeling of his attacks, they were both stronger than those of the White-browed Immortal and the other world spiritists.

The blade in one of his hands turned into a fire dragon. The spear in his other hand turned into a water dragon. The two dragons were both enormous, both capable of hiding the sky and covering the earth. In terms of size, neither dragon was inferior to the Asura Evil Spirit.

On top of that, there were the Evil Suppression Talismans. They had completely wrapped themselves around the Asura Evil Spirit. As such, the fire dragon and the water dragon opened their ferocious beast mouths and tore at the Asura Evil Spirit.

A bite, another bite and another bite.

With each bite, they would create an enormous gap in the body of the Asura Evil Spirit. A large amount of black gaseous flames would be bitten off from its body.

In this sort of situation, the fire dragon and the water dragon became even more ferocious in their bites. They had the appearance of devouring the Asura Evil Spirit alive.

“Quickly, look, that monster is being taken care of!”

“It’s Lord Clan Chief. Lord Clan Chief has come!”

“This is great! That damned monster actually dared to kill our clansmen and destroy our home. It really should be killed!”

“Lord Clan Chief, hooray! Kill that monster for us!”

Even though the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were fleeing in disarray, they were still paying attention to the situation with the Asura Evil Spirit. As they saw the Asura Evil Spirit being bound and bitten by the two enormous dragons, as they saw its enormous body becoming badly damaged, the Nangong Imperial Clansmen were all overjoyed.

“Wuuuaouuu~~~”

However, right at this moment, an ear-piercing roar suddenly sounded. That was the Asura Evil Spirit’s voice.

After that roar sounded, the exceptionally mighty fire dragon and water dragon uttered miserable shrieks. Then, the two dragons fell from the sky and landed onto the ground, causing a giant dust storm.

“Bang~~~~”

Following that, another loud sound was heard. The Evil Suppression Talismans that were wrapped around the Asura Evil Spirit were actually all shattered.

Following that, the fire dragon and the water dragon that were lying on the ground emitted more blood-curdling screeches. Then their bodies exploded, and they were turned into violent energy ripples that swept forth everywhere, destroying all the buildings in their path.

When their bodies exploded, two enormous dark black gaseous flames reappeared. They soared into the sky and fused with the Asura Evil Spirit’s body.

At this moment, not only was the Asura Evil Spirit’s enormous body recovered, its red eyes possessed even stronger killing intent.

At this moment, a killing intent even more frightening than before was unleashed from it. This killing intent completely covered the entire Nangong Imperial Clan.

At this moment, not to mention the Nangong Imperial Clan’s young generation, even the powerful individuals like White-browed Immortal started to shiver in fear.

At the moment when everyone was stunned, that Asura Evil Spirit actually slowly opened its mouth and spoke in a somewhat indistinct yet exceptionally dark and cold manner.

“A... bunch... of... mobs.”
