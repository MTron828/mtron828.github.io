Chapter 3698 - Chu Feng’s Killing Intent

At the same time as Chu Feng felt pained, overwhelming killing intent emerged in his heart.

That said, Chu Feng did not bother to ask any questions. Instead, he immediately released his spirit power and covered Chu Lingxi with it.

Chu Feng was in no mood to think about anything else. He only wanted to quickly treat her injuries.

Upon beginning the treatment, Chu Feng’s heart immediately tensed up.

With Chu Feng’s abilities, he should be able to easily restore Chu Lingxi’s eyes.

Yet now, he was astonished to discover that her eyes were unable to be cured.

She most definitely did not receive a simple physical injury. Instead, her soul was injured.

Her injury was extremely serious!!!

Chu Feng could stabilize her condition and save her life, but he was unable to restore her eyes.

Furthermore, Chu Feng discovered that if her injuries were not treated quickly, her eyes might never recover.

“Grandmaster, please help me.”

Seeing that he was unable to treat Chu Lingxi’s eyes, Chu Feng was left with no choice but to seek out Grandmaster Liangqiu’s help.

Grandmaster Liangqiu had arrived behind Chu Feng and was observing Chu Lingxi’s condition before he made the request.

Thus, he immediately took over once Chu Feng made the request.

However, after taking over, even someone like Grandmaster Liangqiu started frowning.

“Chu Feng, you all go out first.”

“I need to concentrate.”

As Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke, he carried Chu Lingxi into the palace hall.

Chu Feng and the others did not dare to interrupt him. Thus, they could only wait outside the palace.

“Senior, who injured Lingxi?”

Finally, Chu Feng asked the question that had been on his mind most. He had determined with a single glance that Chu Lingxi’s eyes were forcibly dug out by someone.

And now, he must know who had done such an intolerable thing to her.

“It was Linghu Hongfei,” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Linghu Hongfei?”

Chu Feng was very surprised to hear that name.

Chu Feng had not expected Linghu Hongfei to arrive at such a time.

After all, the Linghu Heavenly Clan had declared war against the Starfield Master Realm. At a time like this, a genius like Linghu Hongfei should not be running all over the place.

Chu Xuanzhengfa began to explain the sequence of events to Chu Feng.

Right after Chu Feng was called away by Grandmaster Liangqiu to help treat the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s injuries, Linghu Hongfei had arrived to challenge him.

Chu Lingxi knew that Chu Feng was busy with treating their Lord Clan Chief, and could not accept the challenge. Thus, she decided to accept Linghu Hongfei’s challenge in his place.

As the two fought, Linghu Hongfei showed obvious contempt for Chu Lingxi.

Even though she was clearly a rank three Exalted, Linghu Hongfei was acting like he did not place her in his eyes at all.

As for Chu Lingxi, she was not to be outdone either. She was insulting Linghu Hongfei too, and some of her words ended up angering him.

In a battle, insults can serve as a psychological attack. Logically, insults were accepted to be the norm.

However, it just so happened that Chu Lingxi was defeated in the battle.

Most importantly, Linghu Hongfei harbored hard feelings after being insulted. Thus, not only did he defeated her, but he also deliberately dug out her eyes.

As Linghu Hongfei had arrived with an Utmost Exalted expert from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others were unable to do anything as they watched Linghu Hongfei dig out Chu Lingxi’s eyes.

Their cultivations were simply too weak; so weak that they could not even approach them.

They could only look on as the scene happened before their eyes.

Even though they were extremely worried upon seeing Chu Lingxi’s eyes being dug out, they knew that in a battle between martial cultivators, it was common to see one’s physical body destroyed.

Thus, they had originally thought Chu Lingxi’s injury to be minor and treatable.

However, they had not expected Linghu Hongfei to be so ruthless.

He used some special means to eradicate Chu Lingxi’s eyes from her soul, making her injury unrecoverable.

Because of that, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others were simply unable to treat her.

Helpless, they had no choice but to wait for Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Chengfeng and Chu Feng to finish treating their Lord Clan Chief, and ask for their help.

Boundless killing intent was emitted from Chu Feng’s body.

Chu Feng was clenching his fists tightly out of anger. His veins were all bulging. Anger filled his eyes as his body trembled.

The current Chu Feng was furious to the extreme. Not only was he emitting overwhelming killing intent, but the insides of his body were surging with even greater killing intent.

What Chu Feng detested the most were those that were close to him being injured by others. Linghu Hongfei injuring Chu Lingxi in such an insulting manner caused Chu Feng even greater fury.

“I’m going to kill him!”

As Chu Feng spoke, he planned to rush out to find Linghu Hongfei.

“Chu Feng, calm yourself. If you rush out to find Linghu Hongfei, you will only be throwing your life away.”

Right after Chu Feng rushed forth, he was immediately stopped by Liangqiu Chengfeng.

“He injured Lingxi. I cannot remain indifferent. This debt must be paid in blood,” said Chu Feng.

“Even if you want to settle the debt with blood, you must first assess your own abilities. If you want to take on Linghu Hongfei, you will be confronting the Linghu Heavenly Clan.”

“You are unable to take care of even those from the Blood-devouring Hall, how are you supposed to handle the Linghu Heavenly Clan?” said Liangqiu Chengfeng.

“So what? They’ve come to challenge us, and have already injured Lingxi, I cannot cower in this place. Even if I am to die, I will still fight him,” said Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, they’ve already left,” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Left?” Chu feng was startled upon hearing those words.

“Didn’t he come to challenge me? Why would he leave?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng felt very puzzled.

Linghu Hongfei had deliberately come to the Chu Heavenly Clan to challenge him.

Him fighting Chu Lingxi could be said to be a total accident.

Even if Chu Feng was in isolation to treat the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, it had only been three days.

For Linghu Hongfei to travel all the way to the Chu Heavenly Clan, it most definitely took him more than three days.

If Linghu Hongfei was willing to seek Chu Feng out to challenge him at such a time, it meant that he was rushing to fight him.

Thus, why would he be unwilling to even stay for such a short period of time and wait for Chu Feng to come out? Why would he leave like that?
