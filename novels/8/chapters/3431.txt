Chapter 3431

The woman before Chu Feng looked very young and immature. Judging from her appearance, she should not even be twenty years old. It would not be excessive to call her a young girl.

As for her looks, they could not be said to be exceptionally beautiful. However, she would still be considered to be a little beauty. She had fair skin and clear eyes, that emitted a rare sort of innocent charm.

That said, what Chu Feng was most surprised by was not the appearance of this woman. Instead, it was the title plate on her waist.

Gong Heavenly Clan. That woman was a Gong Heavenly Clansman.

Chu Feng had run across the Gong Heavenly Clan when he had just arrived in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

Those Gong Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were very arrogant and despotic. They brought quite some displeasure to Chu Feng. However, the thing that gave him the strongest impression was not those Gong Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. Instead, it was something else.

Chu Feng had learned from the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief that there was a woman in the Gong Heavenly Clan by the name of Gong Mingyue that was to be his fiancee.

Of course, if the marriage arrangement was to be mentioned, it was quite ridiculous. It was an engagement that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had decided upon without thinking much about when his father wasn’t present.

Furthermore, he had set up the arranged marriage with many other people. That Gong Heavenly Clan’s Gong Mingyue was merely one of them.

Although the arranged marriage was more like a joke, it had left a deep impression of the Gong Heavenly Clan on Chu Feng.

“What are you looking at?”

Seeing that Chu Feng was staring at the title plate on her waist in a pensive manner, the woman immediately frowned.

“It’s nothing. Thank you for rescuing me from the lake,” Chu Feng clasped his fist at the woman. Then, he turned around and planned to leave.

As they were merely strangers that had come together by chance, Chu Feng did not wish to engage in further dealings with that woman. Even if she was someone from the Gong Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng still did not wish to pay much attention to her.

“Jiji.”

Suddenly, strange sounds could be heard from the woman’s bosom.

Chu Feng turned around and saw that the woman had taken out something from her bosom. It was actually a little hedgehog.

The reason why he thought it to be a hedgehog was because it was covered in thorns and had an appearance that greatly resembled that of a hedgehog.

However, that hedgehog was completely golden. Furthermore, the thorns on its body seemed to possess a very strong offensive nature. It was most likely a special type of animal.

Furthermore, Chu Feng could tell that the animal was very intelligent. Otherwise, it couldn’t possibly not cause any harm to that woman, even though its body was covered in such powerful thorns.

Currently, that hedgehog-like animal was very weak. It was ill. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s ill,” Chu Feng said.

“You can tell?” The woman was very surprised.

“Why aren’t you giving it treatment?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ve tried. However, it’s very hard to treat its illness. Reportedly, apart from Saint-cloak World Spiritists, no one can treat its illness.”

“Originally, I had heard that there were Saint-cloak World Spiritists on the Ice Summit. That’s why I brought it here with me so that it could be treated. However, when I went there, the Saint-cloak World Spiritists had all left. Furthermore, I’ve heard that the grand formation on the Ice Summit has been breached, and the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King was taken away.”

“In the end, I’ve journeyed here in vain. Who knows how long my Lil’ Thorn can last.”

As the woman spoke, she looked to the hedgehog in her bosom with a pained expression and gently caressed it, seemingly trying to comfort it.

“Who said that only Saint-cloak World Spiritists could treat it? It is clearly treatable by Immortal-cloak World Spiritists,” Chu Feng said.

“Don’t talk drivel! I found an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist to help treat Lil’ Thorn before. It’s because he told me that he could not treat it that they told me to find a Saint-cloak World Spiritist to treat it,” the woman said.

“That means that the Exalted-cloak World Spiritist you found is incompetent,” Chu Feng said.

“Nonsense! The Exalted-cloak World Spiritist I found is a friend of my grandfather. He couldn’t possibly lie to me. Furthermore, he is also very powerful,” the woman refuted.

“If you don’t trust me, then so be it. I had originally planned to help you, seeing that you’d helped rescue me from the lake. However, since you don’t appreciate my kind intentions, consider it that I’ve said nothing,” as Chu Feng spoke, he planned to leave again.

“Wait,” right at that moment, the young girl descended from the sky and stopped Chu Feng from leaving.

“You’re an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” The woman began to size up Chu Feng.

“No,” Chu Feng shook his head.

“Then...”

“Are you going to tell me that you’re an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist?” The woman revealed a look of suspicion.

However, Chu Feng shook his head again, “Not that either.”

“Tsk. You’re not anything, what makes you think you’re qualified to say that Immortal-cloak World Spiritists could treat my Lil’ Thorn’s illness?” The woman asked. She was extremely dubious of Chu Feng, and felt that he was boasting.

However, she also did not wish to miss out on any opportunity that could treat her little hedgehog. Even if the opportunity was extremely slim, she still didn’t want to miss it. That was why she began to ask Chu Feng what level world spiritist he was.

Chu Feng sighed and shook his head. Then, he found a branch, and began to sketch an outline on the ground.

“That is?” Upon seeing Chu Feng’s sketch, the woman’s eyes opened wide.

The reason for that was because she was able to tell from a single glance that what Chu Feng was outlining was the arrangement method of a spirit formation. Furthermore, the speed at which he outlined it was extremely fast. It could be said that he was extremely skillful. Furthermore, Chu Feng’s spirit formation outline was extremely profound.

“The first three spirit formations are used to concoct medicines. After you finish concocting the medicines, feed your pet the first medicinal pellet. Then, use the fourth spirit formation to treat it’s injury. After you finished setting up that formation, feed it the second medicinal pellet and activate the formation. After its injury is treated, feed it the third medicinal pellet. With that, its illness should be cured,” Chu Feng said.

“Why should I trust you?” The woman asked.

“Girl, you are truly unable to recognize the kind intentions of others. Don’t you know what sort of situation your pet is in? If you don’t treat it immediately, it will not be able to last more than a month. Are you afraid that I will try to harm it?” Chu Feng asked instead of answering.

Hearing those words, the woman pondered for a moment. She felt that what Chu Feng said was correct. Thus, she pointed to Chu Feng and said, “Don’t leave yet. I will do as you say. If you dare to deceive me, I will definitely not let you get away.”

As the woman spoke, she released her spirit power and began to set up spirit formations according to Chu Feng’s instructions.

“No wonder she didn’t believe me. Turns out this girl is an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore... she’s actually a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

As Chu Feng’s spirit power was sealed, he couldn’t sense the woman’s cultivation, and didn’t know how strong she was. Thus, he was surprised after the woman released her spirit power.

To become a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist at her young age, her talent... was very remarkable.

Since the woman did not want him to leave, Chu Feng decided to stay. He found a large rock, sat on it, and began to observe her.

Feeling bored, he asked, “Girl, what’s your name?”

“Gong Qing,” the woman said.

‘Gong Qing? This name is quite pleasant-sounding. It’s much better than that Gong Mingyue,’ Chu Feng thought in his heart.

Upon thinking of Gong Mingyue, Chu Feng asked, “Do you know Gong Mingyue?”

“Of course I do. She’s my older sister,” the woman said.

“Your older sister?” Chu Feng’s expression changed upon hearing those words.

“My biological older sister,” the woman added.

“This...” At that moment, Chu Feng’s mouth hung open.

The girl that he had encountered by chance was actually the younger blood sister of his fiancee?
