MGA: Chapter 1806 - Confrontation Of Imperial Armaments

Blood sprinkled down like rain. While this sort of scene might be something that people frequently saw, the crowd were all feeling their hairs stand on end. After all, the people that had died were all the elites of the Four Great Imperial Clans. Each and every one of them were Half Martial Emperor-level experts.

While Half Martial Emperors were not as rare as Martial Emperors, they were still not a realm that just anyone could reach. At this moment, close to a thousand Half Martial Emperors had been killed in an instant. As such, how could the crowd not be startled by it?

This was especially true for the younger generation. They were deeply frightened. At this time, they had finally managed to see what it meant by viewing human life as grass, what it meant by murder without blinking an eye.

“Snow-hair, you’re truly courting death!”

Seeing that his clansmen had been killed, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder burst into a furious rage. He shook his sleeve and sent forth many waves of martial power to attack the Snow-haired Immortal.

However, facing the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder’s attack, the Snow-haired Immortal actually did not even bother to dodge. She stood there and allowed his unceasing attacks to bombard her body. However, not only was she not damaged in the slightest, even her clothes were not damaged in the slightest.

“Attacks like those are not even capable of tickling me,” The Snow-haired Immortal smiled disdainfully. Then, she raised her hand and made a grabbing motion. Immediately, an invisible power surged out to attack that Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder.

“Emperor Dragon Seal!!!”

Although the Snow-haired Immortal’s attack was invisible, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder’s expression took a huge change. He did not dare to rashly dodge, and ended up taking out the square-shaped Emperor Dragon Seal to block her attack.

“Roar~~~”

Once the Emperor Dragon Seal appeared, not only did it begin to radiate with golden light, it also let out a dragon roar. Furthermore, a enormous several-hundred-meter-long dragon appeared before the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder.

Upon seeing that enormous dragon, many people began to feel deep veneration for it. They felt that with the protection of that enormous dragon, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder would be absolutely safe. The reason for that was because they felt that there was nothing that could shake that enormous dragon.

“Clank~~~”

However, in the very next moment, the enormous dragon’s body trembled. Then, the space around it started to crumble.

“How can this be? We’re clearly both rank four Martial Emperors. How could the Snow-haired Immortal’s battle power be that strong?’

Even though he had managed to block the Snow-haired Immortal’s attack with the Emperor Dragon Seal, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder, as well as the other three Utmost Exalted Elders, all started to frown deeply.

Earlier, had the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder not used the Emperor Dragon Seal, he really might not have been able to block the Snow-haired Immortal’s attack. However, the Snow-haired Immortal was clearly also a rank four Martial Emperor like the four of them.

“Yoh, so it’s actually the Emperor Dragon Seal,” The Snow-haired Immortal said with a light smile.

“Emperor Dragon Seal, that is the Emperor Dragon Seal? The Inherited Treasure of the Four Great Imperial Clans? No wonder... No wonder it possessed such an overwhelming might.” Upon hearing what the Snow-haired Immortal said, the crowd all turned their gazes to the Emperor Dragon Seal in the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder’s hand.

While these people had all heard about the strength of Imperial Armaments, how many among them had actually seen them? After all, Imperial Armaments were like legends. They were items in myths.

“Emperor Dragon Seal? That somewhat resembles the Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal Leng Yue used. Merely... there is also an enormous difference. That is an Imperial Armament, an actual Imperial Armament. Sure enough, it is very extraordinary.”

At this moment, Chu Feng also felt very surprised. No matter how strong a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill might be, it was still a martial skill. However, Imperial Armaments were actual items. The oppressive might that they emitted was simply incomparable.

“However, you’re not the only one with an Imperial Armament,” Right at this moment, the Snow-haired Immortal swung her sleeve. Then, a white light shot forth explosively.

“Boom~~~”

Once that item appeared, heaven and earth started to tremble, and even the oppressive might being emitted by the Emperor Dragon Seal was suppressed. At this moment, an oppressive might not at all weaker than the Emperor Dragon Seal’s was being emitted.

Imperial Armament. It was another Imperial Armament. However, upon looking at it, the crowd was even more shocked.

That Imperial Armament was actually a hairpin. That’s right. It was a hairpin that females would commonly use.

The hairpin was silver in color. Looking at it, it seemed to have been forged with silver. Although there were delicate patterns carved onto it, it did not appear to be very different from ordinary hairpins. In fact, it was even less extravagant-looking than modern hairpins.

However, that hairpin was an Imperial Armament. With the powerful oppressive might it emitted, there was no mistake that it was an Imperial Armament.

“What a dense Ancient Era’s aura. That is an Imperial Armament from the Ancient Era,” Chu Feng had already determined the hairpin’s origin.

In fact, when the hairpin appeared, the experts from the older generation sent forth by the Three Palaces all revealed complicated expressions in their gazes. It was as if they had recognized that hairpin.

“So that Ancient Era’s Imperial Armament ended up in your hands. No wonder you are daring enough to oppose our Four Great Imperial Clans,” At this moment, it was clear that the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Utmost Exalted Elders also recognized that hairpin.

“Humph, there’s a lot more things that you all do not know about,” The Snow-haired Immortal said disapprovingly. However, she did not tell them how that hairpin had ended up in her hands. It was as if she looked down on the Four Great Imperial Clans.

While the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Utmost Exalted Elders wanted to say something, they swallowed down the words that they wanted to say. The Snow-haired Immortal was very strong to begin with. Now that she possessed an Imperial Armament, they really did not wish to fight against her. Even though close to a thousand of their clansmen had been killed, they were still somewhat afraid of her.

Suddenly, a thought came to the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder. A cunning light flashed through his eyes. Then, he turned his gaze to Chu Feng and shouted, “Chu Feng, if you are to commit suicide now, I will release your seniors. Else, I will immediately kill your seniors. Make your decision yourself.”

“Chu Feng is my disciple. His life and death is up to me to decide,” However, before Chu Feng could respond, the Snow-haired Immortal had restricted Chu Feng with a Dragon Mark world spirit formation.

Not only did she restrict Chu Feng’s movements, she also restricted the flow of his martial power. She was preventing Chu Feng from attempting to kill himself.

At this moment, Chu Feng was no longer capable of doing anything to his own life. Everything was controlled by the Snow-haired Immortal. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Snow-hair, with you doing this, you leave us no choice but to kill them,” The Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder covered Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang with his boundless killing intent.

“Go ahead and kill them. What does you killing them have anything to do with me?” The Snow-haired Immortal said disapprovingly.

“You...” Hearing those words, the corners of the four Utmost Exalted Elders’ mouths started to twitch.

Even with this being the case, they did not kill Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang. They actually knew very well that Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang were their own bargaining chips against Chu Feng. Before Chu Feng was killed, they absolutely could not kill them.

“It would seem like you are all just a bunch of cowards. Even with your clansmen being killed, you do not plan to avenge them.”

“Oh, how boring. Since that’s the case, this Immortal shall take her leave,” After the Snow-haired Immortal said those words, she planned to leave.

“Snow-hair, you are truly overly excessive!” At this moment, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder, who had been restraining his rage this whole time, finally exploded. It was not only him, the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder also exploded.

The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder and the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders joined hands. They both took out their respective Emperor Dragon Seals and charged to attack the Snow-haired Immortal.

The reason they reacted in such a manner was because what the Snow-haired Immortal had said was simply equivalent to a public insult. If they still continued to endure even after all this, the fame and reputation of their Four Great Imperial Clans would be completely obliterated.

“Humph, that’s more like it,” However, even with the two Utmost Exalted Elders joining hands to attack her, the Snow-haired Immortal was not afraid in the slightest.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Her hands began to move. Her two sleeves left fragrant wind in their path. Then, her Imperial Armament hairpin suddenly grew in size. It streaked across the horizon and, like a sharp sword, collided with the two Emperor Dragon Seals.

“Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”

In an instant, rumbles resonated nonstop. Emperor’s might surged violently. Many frantic energy ripples, like invisible armies of thousands of men and horses, wreaked havoc through their surroundings.

“Wuuahh~~~”

In no time, many more people from the Four Great Imperial Clans met their deaths. It was not only the people from the Four Great Imperial Clans. Many of the bystanders were also unwillingly involved, and were either killed or injured.

“Block the Emperor’s might!” Upon seeing this, the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Clan Chiefs all started to act. Although they were incapable of participating in the battle between their Utmost Exalted Elders and the Snow-haired Immortal, they could not do nothing about it. They had to try their best to stop the frantic Emperor’s might so as to prevent their clansmen from being killed.

However, the Emperor’s might was truly too powerful. Even though they were rank three Martial Emperors, they were still unable to block all of the surging Emperor’s might.

As long as one was within a certain range of the Emperor’s might, those below Martial Emperor, even if they didn’t die, would be seriously injured.

Seeing how frightening the Emperor’s might being unleashed was, many people began to hurriedly distance themselves from the battlefield. They did not wish to be implicated. Even the people from the Four Great Imperial Clans with low levels of cultivation rushed to escape.

The reason they reacted in this manner was because the Emperor’s might from the battle had already taken the lives of several tens of thousands of people.

“Dongfang, Beitang, she already does not place our Four Great Imperial Clans in her eyes. Why are you all still not joining the fight? Are you planning to ignore this humiliation to our Four Great Imperial Clans?!” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder shouted hysterically.

The reason he shouted those words was not because he was deeply concerned for their Four Great Imperial Clans. Rather, it was because even when joining hands with the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder, they were unable to defeat the Snow-haired Immortal, and were instead being suppressed by her. They had to ask for help. Else, they would pay bitterly today.
