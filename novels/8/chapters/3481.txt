Chapter 3481 - Appearing Through The Abnormal Sign

The reappearance of the abnormal sign greatly alarmed everyone present.

“Clan Chief Tantai, do you know why this abnormal sign has appeared again?” Wuming Ken asked.

“Milord, although the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound’s abnormal sign has not appeared in close to ten thousand years, it appeared frequently during my grandfather’s era.”

“Yet still, I have never heard of the abnormal sign appearing twice in succession, for it was something that was rarely seen, even back then. As for why it would appear twice in succession, I also do not know,” said Tantai Xiangnan.

“Ah, it’s that strange?” After hearing Tantai Xiangnan’s words, the crowd felt with even greater certainty that the abnormal sign was very strange.

“Zzzzz~~~”

At the moment when the crowd were making guesses as to what was happening, two particularly fierce lighting bolts appeared, catching everyone’s attention.

The two lightning bolts were so powerful that they seemed to be capable of tearing apart space itself. If the other lightning bolts were snakes, then these two would be dragons.

The two lightning bolts galloped in the sky with the might of true rulers.

While the abnormal sign’s lightning possessed destructive power that brought endless fear to the crowd, the two lightning bolts that appeared caused even more terror and unease. Even many of the grand characters present started to frown.

“Rumble~~~”

At the moment when fear had filled the crowd’s hearts, at the moment when they were deeply afraid that those two fierce bolts would strike down upon them, the two lightning bolts struck down at the same time. Furthermore, they landed in the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.

Linghu Yueyue and the others that were present in the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound immediately moved far away in fear. As for the crowd gathered outside the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound, they too were completely terrified.

However, to everyone’s surprise, after the two fierce lightning bolts struck, Linghu Yueyue and the others in the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound were not injured. The lightning strikes only created two deep craters in the ground.

Lightning continued to linger on the ground, making it so that the crowd were unable to see through the crater.

Fortunately, the lightning began to dissipate immediately after landing. The clouds that covered the sky also started dissipating.

At that moment, everyone realized that the two lightning bolts that had struck the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound were no simple matter. Thus, their gazes were all focused on the location where that lightning struck in the hopes of realizing what had happened the instant that lightning dissipated completely.

“That is?”

Suddenly, Grandmaster Liangqiu let out a cry of alarm. An expression of joy also appeared on his face.

Following him, many other experts also revealed looks of surprise.

Finally, the lingering lightning completely disappeared. Now, everyone could see exactly what was at the location where it struck.

When the crowd managed to see what was there clearly, their expressions all changed enormously. Many among them even cried out in alarm.

“Chu Feng! That’s Chu Feng! There’s also Wuma Shengjie! They’re actually still alive, they’re still alive!”

It was not only the people of the younger generation that were astonished. Even those from the older generation, those grand characters present, had astonished looks on their faces.

To be able to come out of the hidden path of certain death alive was something that was simply unheard of.

Yet, not only did Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie survive, but they even gave rise to that abnormal sign that struck down with fierce lightning from those clouds. With that, how could the crowd not be astonished?

“Lord Clan Chief,”

Many experts of the Tantai Heavenly Clan turned their gazes to their clan chief, Tantai Xiangnan.

Tantai Xiangnan didn’t say anything. He also did not respond to any of his clansmen’s voice transmissions. He merely had a single expression on his face -- an expression that told his clansmen to quiet down.

Compared to the others, Tantai Xiangnan reacted rather calmly. That said, his gaze was extremely grave. He was staring at Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie, carefully sizing them up and pondering.

That Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was originally something that had belonged to their Tantai Heavenly Clan, and was deemed a forbidden area by them.

The only reason why it was opened to the public and became a place that anyone could access was because their Tantai Heavenly Clan was unable to reach the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm even after occupying the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound for all those years.

Because of that, they had wanted to exploit outsiders, and see if there might be anyone capable of entering the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

However, even after countless years had passed, no one had ever managed to reach the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. Because of that, even they, the Tantai Heavenly Clan, started to believe the legend to be a sham.

They felt that while the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was indeed mysterious, it was likely unrelated to the Nine Dragons Aura located in the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.

Merely, never would they have imagined that someone actually managed to enter the hidden path of certain death and safely return.

At that moment, when even the outsiders felt that Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie had very likely reached the legendary deepest region of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm and come into contact with the Nine Dragons Aura, how could the Tantai Heavenly Clan not think the same?

“Woosh~~~”

At the moment when the crowd were all astonished, someone suddenly walked out from a hidden path.

It was Tang Zhenghao.

However, when Tang Zhenghao saw Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie, he immediately stood there, stunned. His complexion turned deathly pale with fear.

“You... you two?”

Tang Zhenghao was frightened. He had a distorted and alarmed expression. It was as if he had just encountered ghosts.

After all, Tang Zhenghao had personally witnessed Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie entering the hidden path of certain death. He, like everyone else, had thought that they were doomed for death.

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie exchanged glances. Then, the two of them both flew up at the same time, and each landed on one of the positions for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

Tang Zhenghao was only able to react upon seeing that scene. He realized that Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were most likely still alive. Furthermore, they had successfully passed through the hidden path of certain death. Thus, he hurriedly rushed forward and landed on the final spot.

“It would appear that the two young friends have had an extraordinary experience,” Wuming Ken said with a smile. Although he did not directly ask Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie, his words expressed his curiosity toward what they’d experienced.

“What milord says is correct. This experience was truly extraordinary. It was like journeying through hell,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Since young friend Chu Feng is still able to joke around, it would appear that hell is not as terrifying as it’s rumored to be,” Wuming Ken said with a smile.

“Milord is truly one to make jokes. That said, milord, a lot of people are curious as to exactly what this junior has experienced. Should I publicly explain to everyone what I’ve experienced, or should I continue on with the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars?” Chu Feng asked.

The reason why Chu Feng asked that sort of question was because there were countless voice transmissions entering his ears upon escaping the hidden path of certain death.

The great majority of them were even strangers to him. Although Chu Feng was disinclined to answer them, he was rather annoyed by their constant questions. Thus, he wanted to use Wuming Ken to shut those people up.

“What young friend Chu Feng has experienced is your personal matter. Everyone, please don’t insist on asking too much,” Wuming Ken said sternly.

Sure enough, after Wuming Ken spoke, the voice transmissions immediately decreased by more than half. Although there were still reckless fellows that continued to ask about it, Chu Feng completely ignored them.

“Since the Ancestral Martial Decastars have been decided, let us enter the final selection, the sparring of the Ancestral Martial Decastars to determine their rankings,” Wuming Ken said loudly.

“Milord, please wait.”

“This junior also wishes to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.”

Suddenly, a voice was heard.

The crowd were all surprised to hear that voice. It would be one thing if that voice sounded from the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound. However, it came from outside the competition floor. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Someone that didn’t hadn’t entered the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound actually wanted to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars? This was simply looking for trouble!

The crowd subconsciously turned their eyes in the direction of the voice. They wanted to see which reckless fellow it was that dared to stir up trouble in such a place.

“Isn’t that...?!!!”

Upon doing so, the crowd were all greatly alarmed. Even Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were completely surprised.

The reason for that was because the person who had spoken was the publicly accepted number one genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield... Linghu Hongfei!!!
