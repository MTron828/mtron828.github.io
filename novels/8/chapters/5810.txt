Chapter 5810: A Traitor Power Dares to Flaunt?

Chapter 5810: A Traitor Power Dares to Flaunt?

“Jiang Jingyu, I’ll allow you and your people to return to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect if you hand over your son. You’ll receive better treatment than before, and Jiang Yuantai will be guaranteed a brighter future. Otherwise, do you think you can stop me from getting my way? This window of opportunity will be closed if I have to do it with my own hands,” Jia Lingyi threw out an offer upon realizing that she was unable to defeat Jiang Jingyu.

“Lord Lingyi, my son is still young. Please be merciful and spare him,” Jiang Jingyu pleaded.

“It’s a mere son. Why do you have to be so obstinate about this?” Jia Lingyi berated.

“Lord Lingyi, will you be willing to do it if it’s your son? If you insist on having someone as a sacrifice, please take my life instead,” Jiang Jingyu said.

“Hahahaha!” Jia Lingyi suddenly burst into laughter as she halted her attack.

Jiang Jingyu was confused, but he also stopped his attack too. He was clearly hesitant to make Jia Lingyi his enemy.

“Good, Jiang Jingyu. I didn’t judge you wrongly. I’m satisfied,” Jia Lingyi said.

“Lord Lingyi? Could it be...” Jiang Jingyu was stunned, but he quickly thought of a possibility.

“It’s by coincidence we crossed paths in this realm, but I have long heard about your desire to return to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. However, it has been a while since you left, after all, so I’d have to test your character to see if you’re trustworthy or not. I’m glad you stood your ground from the start to the end,” Jia Lingyi said.

“Lord Lingyi, does this mean you didn’t mean anything you said earlier?” Jiang Jingyu was overjoyed.

“Of course I...” Jia Lingyi said with a smile.

All of a sudden, she manifested a spirit power sword and plunged it into Jiang Jingyu’s chest. The sword transformed into a sealing formation, and countless chains instantaneously bound Jiang Jingyu.

“You...” Jiang Jingyu realized he had been duped.

“You fool!” Jia Lingyi sneered.

“Father!” Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai rushed over, with Jiang Taibai and the others trailing behind them.

“You two! What are you doing here? I told you to run! Why did you come back?” Jiang Jingyu was infuriated to see them.

Jia Lingyi burst into laughter and said, “Hahaha! What a touching reunion between father and son. There’s nothing more I love to see more than this!”

Fearing Jiang Kongping’s escape, Jia Lingyi raised her hand and constructed a sealing formation around Jiang Kongping.

“Resorting to trickery when you can’t defeat your enemy. How shameless, Jia Lingyi. I have never seen a woman as wretched as you,” Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.

It was also around then that Chu Feng, Wang Qiang, and the others descended from the sky, appearing within Jia Lingyi’s line of sight.

“Who are you?” Jia Lingyi was unnerved by the appearance of so many gray-cloaked figures.

“Jia Lingyi, are you unable to recognize my voice? Why are you wearing a mask? Are you unable to confront your disgusting face?” Chu Feng asked.

“You... You are Chu Feng?” Jia Lingyi asked with eyes widened in disbelief, though she was confident the voice belonged to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng took off his gray cloak and revealed his true face.

“It’s you! You little beast. You’re still alive!” Jia Lingyi gritted her teeth in fury, as her killing intent poured out.

Jiang Taibai, Jiang Kongping, and the others were stunned. Clearly, Chu Feng and Jia Lingyi were acquainted, and there was a huge grudge between them.

Weng!

Jia Lingyi waved her sleeve and expanded the sealing formation, enveloping Chu Feng and the others in it as well. She glared at Chu Feng with a warped face and sneered, “Chu Feng, I didn’t think you were still alive. Good!”

She had been wanting to exact vengeance on Chu Feng for the longest time now, but at the same time, she knew about Chu Feng’s relationship with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. She knew Chu Feng’s life was now worth a lot of money.

Rather than kill Chu Feng on the spot and quench her hatred, she could earn more by handing Chu Feng over to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“Are you so eager to have your spirit power crippled by me once more?” Chu Feng asked.

“Hahaha!” Jia Lingyi burst into frenzied laughter. “Chu Feng, has no one told you about what happened to the Totem Dragon Clan? There has been a rebellion in the Totem Dragon Clan. Long Chengyu and Long Muxi’s father are dead. Our Pill Dao Immortal Sect are meritorious subjects who have helped overthrow the previous ruler, and Lord Long Lin values us greatly. Your old backing is no more. On top of that, you offended the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. How do you wish to compete with me in your current state? With your measly cultivation? Or your little friends who think they are the biggest in the world?”

Jia Lingyi cast a threatening gaze at the gray-cloaked individuals behind Chu Feng, as if saying ‘I know you’re capable, but look at the disparity in our standings. You better think thrice if you intend to help Chu Feng deal with me.’

Shoosh!

One of the gray-cloaked figures suddenly raised her small, dainty hand, revealing a token bearing the words ‘Immortal Sea Fish Clan’. This token glowed brightly, and it emanated an incredible aura that proved that it was authentic.

“W-who are you?” Jia Lingyi panicked, as the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was a power the Pill Dao Immortal Sect couldn’t afford to offend.

Just then, Xianhai Shaoyu also flashed his Immortal Sea Fish Clan token.

“Two Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen?”

Putting aside Jiang Taibai and the others, even Jiang Jingyu was stunned too. They knew that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was the ruling power of the Immortal Sea Galaxy, and it was one of the strongest powerhouses in the present world of cultivation.

The Pill Dao Immortal Sect might be formidable, but it was nothing compared to the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.

Following that...

The Totem Dragon Clan!

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect!

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!

The Divine Body Heavenly Mansion!

The tokens from the other galaxy overlords were revealed one after another by Long Chengyu, Qin Xuan, Yuwen Yanri, and others. Even Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao revealed their tokens too.

“T-t-this...” Jiang Jingyu and Jiang Taibai were baffled. Jiang Yuantai, Jiang Kongping, and the others shuddered in fear.

These were the strongest powers in the world of cultivation, and Chu Feng actually had their support!

“W-who in the world are you all?” Jia Lingyi asked with a quivering voice.

“Someone of your lowly standing isn’t worthy of seeing my face, but how dare you look down on my brother and flaunt in front of him? I’ll let you know who you have offended,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Xianhai Shaoyu took off his cloak and revealed his true face. Little Fishy, Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, Yuwen Yanri, Wang Qiang, Qin Xuan, Ling Xiao, and Jie Baobao did the same too. With their tokens in hand, they revealed their names one by one.

“Immortal Sea Fish Clan, Xianhai Shaoyu.”

“Immortal Sea Fish Clan, Xianhai Yu’er.”

“Totem Dragon Clan, Long Chengyu.”

“Totem Dragon Clan, Long Muxi.”

“Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, Qin Xuan.”

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Ling Xiao.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Jie Baobao.”

“Divine Body Heavenly Mansion, Yuwen Yanri.”

“D-D-Divine Body Heavenly Mansion, W-W-Wang Qiang.”
