MGA: Chapter 537 - Holy Land of Martialism

“Accordingly, it should be like that. Even my sect’s head was unable to defeat him, so who could have threatened him?”

“On that topic, it was exactly because of Huangfu Haoyue’s challenge that caused my sect’s head to have a knot in his heart and impatiently wanted to become stronger. Because of that, he went astray and died.” The black-clothed old man sighed again. It could be seen that he felt very sorrowful to his sect head’s death.

Hearing that, Chu Feng felt a lot of suspicion. Since Huangfu Haoyue was already so strong, then where did he meet his own father?

Was it possible that his own father was an expert hidden from the world, and even the black-clothed old man didn’t know of his father’s existence?

“Senior, then do you know why this Huangfu Haoyue turned into his current state?!” Chu Feng closely asked while feigning confusion. He was “following the vines to obtain the melon”, and wanted to gain more clues regarding his father from that.

“Hoho, to be honest, I don’t know the reason why he turned into his current state. In reality, I feel very amazed to have seen him again.” The black-clothed old man smiled while shaking his head.

“Senior, why so?” Chu Feng asked with face of puzzledness.

“Because, seventeen years ago, the entire Burning Heaven Church moved, and left the Eastern Sea Region.” The black-clothed old man said.

Hearing that, Chu Feng rejoiced in his heart because he already roughly thought of some things. Quickly afterwards, he asked, “Senior, do you know where they went?”

“The Holy Land of Martialism.” The black-clothed old man said.

“Holy Land of Martialism! Where is that?” Chu Feng curiously asked, but in his heart, he more or less had an answer.

“The Holy Land of Martialism can be said to be the center of this world, but rather than saying it’s the center of this world, it’s better to say it’s a completely different world.”

“Because, at that place, no matter if it’s spiritual energy, Origin power, Profound realm, Heaven power, battle power, all of it is extremely strong, and is absolutely incomparable by this land here.”

“At that place, a group of extremely strong characters and things, beasts and monsters, have been raised. At the same time, it also contains countless treasures, as well as oddities of this world.”

“The Holy Land of Martialism can be said to be the dream of all martial cultivators. However, if they want to enter the Holy Land of Martialism, they have to pass the heaven’s test.”

“And this test is called the Heavenly Road.”

“Heavenly Road?!”

“That’s right. The Heavenly Road. It’s said that for those who enter the Holy Land of Martialism, their cultivation can reach the heavens in one step. So, the road to the Holy Land of Martialism is called the Heavenly Road.”

“The Heavenly Road only appears once every year. Those who have ambition can enter, but for those who enter the Heavenly Road, their fates cannot be predicted.”

“Some people say that the Heavenly Road is a checkpoint and those, whose aptitude qualify, can pass.”

“There are also some people who say that the Heavenly Road is a reincarnation cycle. Entering the Heavenly Road is equal to rebirth. Their memories get washed away, and are reborn later in the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“There are also some people who say that inside the Heavenly Road, there are countless dangers and only those with powerful strength can pass through. The weak ones will all die within.”

“But no matter which saying is correct, presently, of those who stepped into the Heavenly Road, not a single has returned.”

“Thus, two sayings have been passed down.”

“The first was that the so-called test of the Heavenly Road simply does not exist. Everyone who step in can enter the Holy Land of Martialism, but they cannot return.”

“The other saying is that the Holy Land of Martialism simply does not exist, and that the Heavenly Road is a tomb. Everyone who enter it do not return, and will all die.”

“Those two sayings encouraged some people, and also deterred some people. The Burning Heaven Church is a power that believes in the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“They firmly believed that as long as talent reached a certain degree, they would be able to enter the Holy Land of Martialism. So, their hearts embraced ambition, but not towards the Eastern Sea Region. Their ambition was directed at the Holy Land of Martialism. So, when they felt that the time was ripe, they brought the entire church and aimed to move into the Holy Land of Martialism, and entered the Heavenly Road.”

“And exactly because of the departure of the Burning Heaven Church and the fragmentation of my Crippling Night Demon Sect, the people in the Eastern Sea Region thought that the Immortal Execution Archipelago became the strongest power in the Eastern Sea Region.”

“However, right now, something unexpected seemed to have happened.” Suddenly, the black-clothed old man smiled.

“Senior, you are talking about Huangfu Haoyue?!” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. Back then, when the Burning Heaven Church entered the Heavenly Road, I did go watch them and personally saw Huangfu Haoyue and the others enter, and also personally saw the Heavenly Road close.”

“At present, Huangfu Haoyue has actually reappeared in this land, which means that something must have happened. To be honest, I truly hope that his mind can be restored because as long as it is, the mystery of the Heavenly Road and the Holy Land of Martialism can be unraveled.”

“Whether the Holy Land of Martialism exists or not, and what does the inside of the Heavenly Road look like, I’m sure that they are something that everyone in the Eastern Sea Region want to know.” The black-clothed old man lightly smiled, then his gaze suddenly flashed, seeming to have thought of something, and said, “That’s right. If you want to know more about Huangfu Haoyue, you can look for a person.”

“Who?”

“Qiushui Fuyan!”

“Qiushui Fuyan?”

“That’s right. Qiushui Fuyan was the Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church of back then. She was originally Huangfu Haoyue’s fiancée.”

“The two of them had a very close relationship, but in the past, when the Burning Heaven Church entered the Heavenly Road, I discover a small detail, and it was that I couldn’t see the Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church, Qiushui Fuyan.”

“Later on, with my inquiry and searching, I finally learnt that Qiushui Fuyan went to a place called the Lovers Terrace. However, because of her special status, I did not go find her.” The black-clothed old man said.

“Lovers Terrace? Is that also in the Eastern Sea Region?” Chu Feng asked, because he was definitely going to go there.

After all, he knew that when Huangfu Haoyue first came to the continent of the Nine Provinces, he had a clear mind, or else he wouldn’t have entrusted him to Chu Yuan. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

And no matter if he returned from the Heavenly Road or the Holy Land of Martialism, since his relationship with Qiushui Fuyan was that special, it was likely that he went to visit her.

If he did visit her, then he should have told her about some things. Although it was only a possibility, at least he had some hope.

In reality, hearing the black-clothed old man talk about those things, and associating it with the words of insanity Huangfu Haoyue talked about before, Chu Feng already roughly guessed some things.

It was that his family, or at least his father, was definitely not located in the Eastern Sea Region, and if he was not located on the Heavenly Road as well, he was definitely within the Holy Land of Martialism. However, Chu Feng felt that the possibility he was in the Holy Land of Martialism was greater.

After all, the Divine Lightning he grasped was very special. He could not be sure it was from a Divine Body, nor could he be sure it was from a bloodline. At least, it was something that people here didn’t understand, but if he came from the Holy Land of Martialism, that would make much more sense.

Of course, after all, everything was speculation. The one who knew the true answer was only Huangfu Haoyue.

And other than Huangfu Haoyue, it was likely that only Qiushui Fuyan possibly knew some more things.

So, Chu Feng had to go find Qiushui Fuyan, because he did not want to miss the single strand of hope in knowing his ancestry.
