Chapter 4205 - Controlling The Grand Formation

Right when Chu Feng was suspecting whether or not the voice belonged to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, a voice sounded from within the spirit formation again.

“Oh, that’s right. Regardless of who you might be, do not mention the fact that this old man is still alive to others.”

“This is a trial for you.”

“If you’re able to keep this secret, this old man will definitely reward you in the future.”

“If you spread this secret, this old man will not forgive you easily.”

Chu Feng became endlessly excited. He was so excited that he was on the verge of jumping for joy.

Earlier, he still hadn’t been absolutely certain.

But now, he was practically certain that the voice belonged to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Perhaps the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been in too much of a hurry. Or perhaps he had acted without thinking.

He had left behind his current voice, and not Zhuge Yuankong’s voice.

“So senior Ox-nose is actually senior Zhuge Yuankong.”

“No wonder senior Ox-nose was capable of fusing Divine Power and Heavenly Bloodlines.”

“But, why is senior Ox-nose not using the identity of Zhuge Yuankong anymore? Why did he change his identity?”

“Could it be that he’s afraid that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted will try to kill him?”

After the joy Chu Feng felt had passed, he became slightly confused.

He didn’t understand why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would want to conceal the fact that he was still alive.

Chu Feng felt that the most probable explanation was that it had something to do with the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

After all, Yu Ting had told him that Zhuge Yuankong had had conflicts with the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“Forget it. I’ll find senior Ox-nose first.”

“But... where would senior Ox-nose be?”

Chu Feng wanted to quickly find the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and ask him how to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

But, when Chu Feng had parted with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had told him to not bother seeking him out, because he wouldn’t be able to find him even if he did.

He said he would instead come find Chu Feng when the time was right.

“Forget it. Let me bring everyone out from this place first.”

After saying those words, with a single thought from Chu Feng, he left the formation core.

He reappeared at the protected area.

The crowd were still in awe of Chu Feng’s might.

Chu Feng’s sudden appearance shocked all of them.

“Lord Chu Feng, you’ve returned so quickly?”

“How was it? Did you manage to find the method to leave this place?”

The crowd were all overjoyed to see Chu Feng. They immediately moved toward him to make inquiries.

Back then, they had all addressed Chu Feng as young hero or young friend.

However, the great majority of them no longer dared to address Chu Feng in such a manner. After witnessing how powerful Chu Feng was, the great majority of them began addressing him as ‘Lord Chu Feng’, and were extremely respectful.

“Everyone, as I have limited time, I am unable to bring you all out of here one after the other.”

“I am only able to open a single spirit formation teleportation gate. You can all leave this place through that teleportation gate, and then take the teleportation formations outside to return to your respective worlds.”

As Chu Feng spoke, black gaseous flames began to rise from his body. He then pointed to the sky, and a dark black spirit formation gate appeared.

“Lord Chu Feng, that is?!”

The crowd were all endlessly excited to see the spirit formation gate.

At the same time they felt nervous. Whilst the people that had grown up there were still alright, the Golden Crane True Immortal, plain-clothed old monk and the others of the older generation had all recognized the spirit formation gate.

It was none other than the spirit formation gate that had brought them there.

Seeing the spirit formation gate, they felt complicated emotions.

“This spirit formation gate is not only able to teleport you all out of here, it will also send you all to a safe place. You will be able to leave this place once you step through the spirit formation gate.”

“But remember, do not try to return once you leave.”

“If I’m not here, I won’t be able to teleport you all out again,” Chu Feng said to the crowd.

Even though Chu Feng controlled the power of the isolated world, the power he controlled was limited. There were a lot of things he couldn’t do.

For example, the spirit formation connected multiple starfields and covered countless worlds.

In some worlds, there was only a single spirit formation gate. However, some other places had an entire grand formation, or multiple small formations that all linked back to the isolated world.

At present, Chu Feng was not very familiar with the grand formation.

Even though he could open spirit formation gates to teleport people in and out, he could only open one at a time.

Furthermore, he would need to carefully search for the spirit formation gate that was linked to an area in order to use it.

That was the reason why Chu Feng was unable to teleport the crowd back to their respective worlds.

Doing so would be too time consuming.

Furthermore, although the spirit formation beasts now listened to Chu Feng’s orders, he was unable to eliminate them. Moreover, he needed to be there in order to command them.

As such, once Chu Feng left, it would become dangerous again.

It was the reason why Chu Feng had told them not to return.

“Thank you, Lord Chu Feng.”

“Lord Chu Feng is simply akin to a second parent to us.”

[1. Calling someone a second parent means that they’re an enormous benefactor, so much so that they could rival one’s own parents.]

The crowd were all extremely excited. However, they did not leave immediately. Instead, they bowed respectfully to Chu Feng. Especially those from the older generation, who went as far as to kneel before Chu Feng. Some among them were so excited that they began weeping bitter tears.

To them, Chu Feng being able to help them escape was so much of a grace that it was simply akin to giving them a new lease on life.

“Seniors, please rise. Go ahead and leave this place. Return to your families.”

“If fate has it, we’ll meet again,” said Chu Feng.

The crowd got up in succession after hearing Chu Feng’s words. They clasped their fists at Chu Feng again and then leapt into the spirit formation gate.

“Young friend Chu Feng, if you had come in here sooner, we wouldn’t have been trapped for so long.”

When the majority of the people were standing in line to leave, the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk were not in a rush to leave. They instead walked over to Chu Feng.

The two of them were, after all, people that had seen Chu Feng grow up for a period of time.

Whilst they’d thought highly of Chu Feng before, they were still intensely proud of him after witnessing how much he had grown.

Although they did not have any blood relation with him, they still felt proud of him.

“Senior, do you still remember Zhao Hong?” Chu Feng asked the plain-clothed old monk.

“That demonic woman Zhao Hong? This old man naturally remembers her.”

“She was able to purge her murderous desires. Although she didn’t regain her memories, she regained her rationality. Didn’t she become your close friend too?”

“Although she had lost her memories of her past life, her talent was still exceptional. She is also a demon-level genius,” said the plain-clothed old monk.

“Zhao Hong had recovered her memories and returned to the Reincarnation Upper Realm. But, she needs the Reincarnation Pearl,” said Chu Feng.

“Oh? You mean this pearl?”

As the plain-clothed old monk spoke, he immediately took out the Reincarnation Pearl from his Cosmos Sack.

“Senior, that is indeed the pearl.”

Chu Feng couldn’t help but recall his time back in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm after seeing the pearl.

Back then, he was very small and weak. The plain-clothed old monk had been a mysterious expert akin to a mountain peak.

Back then, he never would’ve imagined that his cultivation would increase to his current level in such a short period of time.

Because of that, Chu Feng began feeling a sudden surge of emotions.

“Young friend Chu Feng, do you know where Zhao Hong is right now?” asked the plain-clothed old monk.

“I do,” answered Chu Feng.

“Since that’s the case, you can help this old man return this Reincarnation Pearl to its rightful owner.”

The plain-clothed old monk handed the Reincarnation Pearl to Chu Feng, who accepted it without hesitation.

Then, the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk also prepared to leave.

After chatting with them, Chu Feng learned that the two of them intended to return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

As coincidence would have it the grand formation was able to directly connect to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Because of that, Chu Feng went out of his way to open up a new spirit formation gate that led to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

After the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk left through the new spirit formation gate, Chu Feng closed the spirit formation gate and opened up a new one.

The new spirit formation gate led to Zhuge Yuankong’s former residence.

Chu Feng was going to find Yu Ting and inform her that he was safe.

Fortunately, Yu Ting had not left the residence, and had been thinking of a way to rescue Chu Feng.

When Chu Feng told Yu Ting about his experiences, especially when he informed her that Zhuge Yuankong was still alive, and that he even knew him, Yu Ting became wild with joy.

Ignoring the fact that Zhuge Yuankong knew the method to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, he could be said to be Yu Ting’s benefactor too.

Learning that her benefactor was still alive, Yu Ting naturally felt happy.

Afterwards, Chu Feng returned to the grand formation.

The reason for that was because he could only activate spirit formation gates that led to other places inside the grand formation. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Chu Feng had a new destination in mind. He was going to go to the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

First, he needed to deliver the Reincarnation Pearl to Zhao Hong.

Then, he wanted to find Yuan Shu’s master, Grandmaster Tang Cheng.

As Grandmaster Tang Cheng was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s close friend, he might know of his whereabouts.

Although Chu Feng had never met Grandmaster Tang Cheng, he felt that he should still try his luck.

By pure coincidence, the grand formation had a spirit formation gate that led to the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

Perhaps it was something the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had set up deliberately. After all, he knew that Grandmaster Tang Cheng was in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

Truth is, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had set up all those spirit formation gates for his own convenience. Otherwise, why would there be a spirit formation gate in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm too?

Although Chu Feng had gained the power of the spirit formation and knew roughly all the locations that it connected to, he still could not open the spirit formation gates at will.

Chu Feng needed to find the corresponding spirit formation gate from among numerous spirit formation gates.

Chu Feng began searching for the spirit formation gate that connected to the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

But, as he continued to search for it, his expression suddenly changed.

Although he still hadn’t found the spirit formation gate that connected to the Reincarnation Upper Realm, he found a familiar figure in one of the spirit formation gates.
