Chapter 2826 - Expedition Against Yuwen City

“Little friend Chu Feng, that sword of yours...”

Ma Changchun immediately noticed the Evil God Sword in Chu Feng’s hand the moment he took it out.

Following that, he cast a confused gaze at Chu Feng.

“Oh, this sword is something given to me by a relative of mine. I suddenly started to recall him. Whenever I see this sword, I will feel like I’m seeing him,” Chu Feng explained.

Chu Feng must continue to hold onto the Evil God Sword going forward. As such, he would naturally have to find an excuse for that.

“Oh, no wonder little friend Chu Feng would suddenly take out such a weapon. So it was actually an item of significance to you,” Ma Changchun said with a smile.

Evidently, he had questioned Chu Feng earlier because he was unable to understand why Chu Feng would suddenly take out such a weapon.

Although the Evil God Sword possessed unimaginable power, its outward appearance was only that of an Incomplete Imperial Armament.

In the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, a weapon like that was equivalent to a worthless scrap of metal. If it were tossed onto the street, no one would be willing to pick it up.

This was even more so as Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword possessed such a distinctive appearance. Looking at it, it seemed to be inferior to even ordinary Incomplete Imperial Armaments. As such, it was no wonder Ma Changchun would be so curious as to why Chu Feng would suddenly take out such a weapon and hold it so tightly in his hand.

That being said, Ma Changchun accepted Chu Feng’s explanation. Thus, he no longer continued to ask Chu Feng about the Evil God Sword and continued on with the journey.

It was as Ma Changchun said, the Sacred Pellet Villa was not very far away from Yuwen City. The two powers could be said to be adjacent to one another.

Upon returning to the Sacred Pellet Villa, that Shi Fufang just so happened to be present too. Ma Changchun and the others confronted Shi Fufang directly, and declared that he had colluded with Yuwen City to kill his fellows.

Originally, Shi Fufang wanted to quibble and deny the claims.

However, when the crowd managed to find that Immortal Armament originally belonging to Yuwen City from his Cosmos Sack, he was met with irrefutable evidence.

After verifying this matter, the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master was immediately furious. He shot forth a palm strike and utterly crushed Shi Fufang on the spot.

After that, he led his army toward Yuwen City. He planned to seek justice for what they’d done.

The Sacred Pellet Villa had already had their elites gathered in order to proceed for the Void Sacred Tree.

As such, they decided to lead this group of elites on a crusade against Yuwen City.

Although their numbers could not be said to be to be grand, everyone present possessed very powerful auras.

Apart from Chu Feng, the weakest among this group of people were Heavenly Immortal-level experts. As for the most powerful several individuals, they were all Martial Immortals.

This was an actual army of elites. Each and every one of them were experts. They were existences renowned throughout the Sacred Pellet Villa.

Logically, traveling together with this group of people, Chu Feng’s qualification and strength were both akin to that of an ant. He was a truly weak existence. Logically, he would be ignored and looked down on by others.

However, Chu Feng was already famous. Furthermore, him defeating Han Yu had already become known to the people from the Sacred Pellet Villa.

Thus, not to mention the elders of the Sacred Pellet Villa being extremely eager and attentive toward Chu Feng, even the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master was very polite when speaking with Chu Feng.

In fact, he even attempted to coax Chu Feng into joining their Sacred Pellet Villa.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you couldn’t possibly be deceiving this old man, right?”

The Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master was a white-haired old man with a beard across his face.

He was currently standing beside Chu Feng. He had chatted with Chu Feng the entire journey, and was currently making a massive effort to invite Chu Feng to their Sacred Pellet Villa. Unfortunately, he was refused by Chu Feng.

He found the reason Chu Feng gave to refuse him somewhat difficult to accept.

“Senior, this junior is truly not lying to you. I really do not plan to join any powers.”

“If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t have refused the invitation from the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master when I was at the Immortal Armament Villa,” Chu Feng said.

“You’ve also refused the invitation from the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master?” The Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master asked.

“That’s correct,” Chu Feng said.

“Haha. If that’s the case, then this old man believes you,” the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master burst into loud laughter upon hearing Chu Feng’s response.

Even though he was already an old man, he had a very laid-back personality, and did not conceal his thoughts at all.

“Senior Villa Master, regarding what Yuwen City has done, what do you plan to do about it?” Chu Feng asked.

What Chu Feng was most concerned about right now was his grudge with Yuwen City.

En route, Chu Feng had been thinking about it. He felt that since the Sacred Pellet Villa and Yuwen City were adjacent to one another and had lived in harmony for so long, it would mean one of two things. Either they possessed a very good relationship, or there was something maintaining the relationship between the two of them.

While it was true that Yuwen City was in the wrong, it remained that the Sacred Pellet Villa had only lost some disciples. Chu Feng did not think that the Sacred Pellet Villa would end up declaring war against Yuwen City because of them.

At the very most, they would only attempt to retrieve their lost face.

“The price of murder is one’s life. I will have whoever it is that killed the people of my Sacred Pellet Villa pay with their lives,” the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master said. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“But... the Yuwen City’s City Master has also killed people from the Sacred Pellet Villa,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s simple, I will have the Yuwen City’s City Master pay with his life,” the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master said.

Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed. He didn’t know how realistic the words spoken by the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master were. However, he did wish for the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master to do that.

Thus, Chu Feng asked, “Senior, what percentage of certainty of success do you hold?”

“Hahahaha...” Hearing those words, the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master burst into another loud laugh.

Merely, this time around, his laughter was very profound.

As he laughed, the Sacred Pellet Villa’s elders also started laughing.

No one answered Chu Feng’s question. However, their laughter had already given Chu Feng an answer.

The Sacred Pellet Villa should be stronger than Yuwen City in terms of strength. At the very least, the Sacred Pellet Villa was confident in their strength.

Thus, the Sacred Pellet Villa shouldn’t place Yuwen City in their eyes at all.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you can rest assured. Our Sacred Pellet Villa’s disciples will definitely not have died in vain. We will definitely obtain justice for them,” the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master said to Chu Feng.

Soon, the Sacred Pellet Villa’s army arrived before Yuwen City.

Although Yuwen City was called a city, it would not be excessive to say that it was an enormous nation.

Not only did they possess enormous land, their city was also enormous in size. It would not be excessive to say that merely Yuwen City’s main city would be larger than the entire Nine Provinces Continent.

However, it might be that they had detection spirit formations or some other sort of monitoring means, but they were already on guard against the arrival of the Sacred Pellet Villa’s army.

The reason why that was the case was because outside of Yuwen City was an active defensive formation emitting golden light. That defensive formation connected heaven and earth, and completely covered the vast and boundless city.

It could be said to be an extremely magnificent sight. At the very least, this was the first time Chu Feng had ever seen such a powerful and enormous spirit formation.

It could be seen that the spirit formation was not only constructed by a large amount of world spiritists, it was also a great project.

However, it seemed that the Sacred Pellet Villa did not place that enormous spirit formation before their eyes.

At the very least, Chu Feng was able to see calmness in the eyes of the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master.

That being said, it remained that Yuwen City was prepared. The Yuwen City’s City Master and their various experts were all present at the entrance of the city in an orderly manner.

It was as if they were waiting for the arrival of the Sacred Pellet Villa’s army.

“Yuwen Yanhong awaits the arrival of the Sacred Pellet Villa’s Villa Master and the various elders,” the Yuwen City’s City Master said with clasped fist.

His attitude was extremely courteous. However, when he greeted the Sacred Pellet Villa’s crowd courteously, he also took a glance at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng felt hatred and killing intent from his eyes.
