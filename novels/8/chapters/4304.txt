Chapter 4304 - Who Is It?

“Wuu---”

Suddenly, Xianhai Shaoyu felt his head getting heavy. Then, he felt extremely sleepy.

“What’s going on? Could this be a side effect caused by fourth uncle stipping the power from my body?”

Xianhai Shaoyu doesn’t want to lose consciousness at a time like this.

He wanted to continue to watch the battle. He wanted to see exactly how powerful Chu Feng after undergoing bloodline berserk would become.

Xianhai Shaoyu tried his hardest to withstand the desire to sleep. He even took out medicines and took them.

While he was confined and unable to move freely, he was still capable of taking out items from his Cosmos Sack.

For the sake of overcoming his sleepiness, Xianhai Shaoyu took three successive medicinal pellets. All three of those medicinal pellets were of extraordinary value.

Once they entered his mouth, they turned into gaseous flames that engulfed his entire body.

But, Xianhai Shaoyu was unable to feel any sense of joy even after taking them.

“They’re useless?”

Xianhai Shaoyu started to panic. Even though he took three priceless medicinal pellets in succession, they were unable to curb his sleepiness.

He had no idea what to do if this was to continue.

Soon, Xianhai Shaoyu was unable to endure his sleepiness anymore and fell unconscious.

“What’s going on with this Xianhai Shaoyu?”

“Hey! You pretending to be dead?!”

Seeing that Xianhai Shaoyu suddenly fell onto the ground, the Demon Morph Clansmen were all surprised. They went up to him to examine him.

After all, the power within Xianhai Shaoyu was still of use to them. If he dies like this, they would not be able to retrieve the power from him.

After they discovered that Xianhai Shaoyu was still breathing and had only lost consciousness, they decided to not pay any more attention to him.

After all, it was Xianhai Renhu who restricted Xianhai Shaoyu.

No matter what sort of trick Xianhai Shaoyu might try, he would not be able to break free.

As such, the people from the Demon Morph Clan turned their gazes back to Chu Feng and their two leaders’ battle.

The current situation of the battle was very unfavorable to them.

Xianhai Renhu and the red-haired leader were unable to cause any harm to Chu Feng even after joining hands.

Instead, it was the two of them that were being suppressed by Chu Feng.

While they’ve not sustained any serious injuries, the two of them were already panting. If this was to continue, it would only be a matter of time before they’re defeated.

“One’s bloodline going berserk is this powerful?”

“It would appear that we will have to prepare to withdraw from this place.”

Xianhai Renhu said to the red-haired leader using voice transmission.

The red-haired leader nodded his head at Xianhai Renhu’s proposal.

The two of them had displayed their full strength against Chu Feng. But, Chu Feng still didn’t go all out against them.

The reason why they did not flee directly was because they were waiting.

They knew Chu Feng’s bloodline would not forever remain in a berserk state. Sooner or later, the berserk state will wear off. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They were waiting for the time when Chu Feng’s bloodline’s berserk state wears off.

But, they must still prepare for an alternative just in case.

It was possible for Chu Feng’s bloodline’s berserk state to become even stronger.

At that time, they would no longer be able to take him on.

As such, if they find the situation to have turned bad, they must leave at once.

If they failed to escape promptly, they might not be able to escape at all.

“Zzzzz---”

Suddenly, something strange happened.

The lightnings Chu Feng unleashed at them was actually blocked.

“Wuu---”

Then, a look of pain appeared on Chu Feng’s face.

It was a look of struggle.

“Eeeahhh---”

Suddenly, Chu Feng started screaming.

Boundless lightnings were being unleashed from his body nonstop.

Even the space within the starry sky was being shattered.

Sensing the power unleashed by Chu Feng, Xianhai Renhu and the red-haired leader immediately moved away. They were able to sense that the power unleashed by Chu Feng right now was capable of killing them.

But, strangely, even though the power unleashed by Chu Feng was so very terrifying, they would be quickly sealed away by a mysterious power soon after their release.

Chu Feng seemed to be trapped within a certain range.

No matter how devastating his powers were, they were unable to exceed that range.

Furthermore, the range was constantly decreasing.

Finally, the lightnings in the sky began to disperse.

The lightnings unleashed by Chu Feng also completely disappeared.

His eyes that were surging with lightnings also closed shut.

After this region of the starry sky returned to its prior peaceful state, Chu Feng had fallen asleep again.

“It disappeared?”

“His bloodline finally finished going berserk.”

Xianhai Renhu heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing this sight.

“Something’s amiss,” But, the red-haired leader was skeptical.

“What’s amiss?” asked Xianhai Renhu.

“According to my clan’s records, while bloodline going berserk will eventually fade away, the manner at which his berserk bloodline returned to normal was different from what was recorded by my clan.”

“This does not resemble a natural disappearance. Instead, it seemed like it was forcibly suppressed by some sort of power,” said the red-haired leader.

“None of that matters. As long as that kid calmed down, it will be advantageous for us.”

“That said, never would I imagine for a genius of this caliber to appear in a place like the Holy Light Galaxy,” Xianhai Renhu looked to Chu Feng. Shock filled his eyes.

“That is indeed a pleasant surprise.”

“Encountering this kid is truly a sign of the heavens looking out for us.”

“Even if we failed to find that power in the Holy Light Galaxy, we would not have come here in vain.”

“Once Lord Clan Chief learned of this kid, he will definitely reward the two of us.”

Different from Xianhai Renhu’s exclamation of surprise, the red-haired leader who managed to awaken from the shock Chu Feng gave him started to laugh strangely.

“You seemed to have some other plan in mind?” asked Xianhai Renhu.

“Of course.”

“What that kid possesses is the same Heavenly Bloodline that my clan possesses.”

“To be able to allow his bloodline to enter a berserk state, his bloodline has reached an inestimable level of power.”

“It is simply a waste for such a powerful bloodline to end in the hands of a trash like him.”

“It should instead be in the control of our Demon Morph Clan.”

As the red-haired leader spoke, he began to walk toward Chu Feng.

Xianhai Renhu knew what he was planning to do.

He was no longer simply planning to strip away the power Chu Feng gained from the black case.

That red-haired leader was also planning to strip away Chu Feng’s bloodline’s power.

This sort of thing was not only very difficult to do, it was also extremely cruel.

It was something so cruel that it would arouse everyone’s anger.

But, for the sake of obtaining a stronger bloodline, the Demon Morph Clan was willing to do anything.

They simply don’t care about Chu Feng’s life and death.

“Who are you calling trash?”

Suddenly, a voice sounded from the distant starry sky.

“Who is it?!”

The Demon Morph Clansmen’s expression all grew tense the moment they heard that voice.

Even the red-haired leader and Xianhai Renhu were no exception.

At this moment, they all turned their gazes toward Chu Feng’s direction.

The reason for that was because that voice sounded from Chu Feng’s direction.

But, they were certain that was not Chu Feng’s voice.

There was someone else here!
