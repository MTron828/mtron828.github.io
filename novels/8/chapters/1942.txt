Chapter 1942 - Setting up the Formation

“Milady Queen is extremely powerful. Merely, her cultivation has been sealed.”

“However, this golden water might be able to help me unseal Milady Queen’s cultivation,” Chu Feng said to Xian Miaomiao.

“Ah? Then how powerful is lil sis Eggy? Is she as powerful as me?” Xian Miaomiao asked.

“I’m not certain myself. However, I feel that she might be more powerful than you,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

Chu Feng did not know what Her Lady Queen’s cultivation really was. However, he was certain of one thing. That is, Her Lady Queen was a Martial Emperor stronger than the Asura Evil Spirit that he had released before.

The current situation was extremely bad. The Dark Hall’s Hall Master had already targeted Chu Feng. Even though he had not killed Chu Feng, Chu Feng knew that he had considered him to be a threat. Sooner or later, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master would kill him.

If he were able to unseal Her Lady Queen’s cultivation at that time, it would be enormously beneficial to his predicament.

“Aiyaya, I had originally planned to look after lil sis Eggy. Am I to be looked after by my lil sis now?” After finding out that Her Lady Queen’s cultivation was very strong, Xian Miaomiao revealed a depressed expression. However, soon after, she looked to Eggy and said, “However, it’s alright. After all, you’re the lil sis. Even if you are to be looking after your big sis, it would only be a matter of course.”

“Hehe, very well. After I regain my cultivation, I will make sure to properly do my duty as the big sis and properly discipline you,” A sinister smile appeared on Her Lady Queen’s face.

“Eh...” Xian Miaomiao was startled to see that smile. Feeling helpless, she turned to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, properly manage your Eggy. She’s planning to bully me.”

“Hahaha, Chu Feng is merely this Queen’s servant. Did you think that he could control me?” Her Lady Queen placed her hands on her waist as she laughed loudly. However, her appearance was truly adorable.

“Chu Feng, tell me that what she said is not the truth,” Xian Miaomiao looked to Chu Feng.

“No, Miaomiao, what Her Lady Queen said is the truth,” Chu Feng said helplessly.

“Oh, noooo!!!!” Xian Miaomiao shouted in depression.

However, soon, Xian Miaomiao’s gaze shifted, and her expression changed. It was as if she had thought of something.

With a beaming smile, she looked to Eggy and said, “Big sis Eggy, please look after me in the future. Let’s bully Chu Feng together. Big sis, just don’t bully me, okay?”

“The hell!” Chu Feng was speechless upon hearing those words. That girl was truly too shameless. She actually admitted defeat right away. However, it was one thing for her to admit defeat. Yet, she actually involved him in this matter. He was merely a bystander!

“Chu Feng, are you really able to help me undo the seal?” Her Lady Queen was still hesitant. As the spirit formation seal had accompanied her for so long, she was fully aware of how strong that seal was.

“I have a fifty percent certainty of being able to do so. However, that fifty percent certainty is only of being able to unseal a portion of your cultivation. I am unable to completely undo my mother’s seal,” Chu Feng said.

“Then, when do you plan to attempt it?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“This matter should be not be delayed. Let’s do it now,” Chu Feng said.

“Now?” Both Her Lady Queen and Xian Miaomiao were surprised by Chu Feng’s words.

“Rest assured, the people from the Dark Hall have already left. Else, they would’ve already shown themselves by now.”

“Furthermore, I am unable to take this golden water away from here. Thus, regardless of when we attempt to undo the seal, we can only do it here.”

“Furthermore, as the Blood Devouring Killing Formation has been destroyed, if this matter were to spread, countless experts would come here to search for treasures.”

“Thus, it is not safe to keep the golden water here. If we wish to use it, we must do so immediately,” Chu Feng said.

“In that case, what should I do?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“I need to face you when undoing your seal. Thus, when attempting to do so, I will need you to be out here.”

“Furthermore, after I finish setting up the formation, you will enter a half unconscious state. Although you will be aware, and can continue to see and hear what is happening through me, you will unable to speak. It is only after the formation is completed that you will be able to regain your freedom.”

“Furthermore, I will only know whether or not we can successfully remove your seal after that spirit formation is completed,” Chu Feng said. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Then, how long will it take?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“I’m not sure,” Chu Feng said.

“Doesn’t matter then. Since we’ve decided, let’s begin,” Her Lady Queen said.

Then, Chu Feng had Her Lady Queen sit on the golden water. Then, using the golden water as the core, Chu Feng began to set up his spirit formation.

Even though the golden water was the most important part of the spirit formation, Chu Feng, for the sake of setting up this spirit formation, took out all of his most precious treasures and materials.

Furthermore, Chu Feng spent over an entire month setting up that spirit formation. Chu Feng had never spent this much time setting up a spirit formation before. This was the longest he had ever taken.

During this period of time, Xian Miaomiao and Lil Red guarded the cave the entire time. Furthermore, they did not say a single word.

It was only when Chu Feng stood back up and heaved a long sigh that Xian Miaomiao ran over to him.

As Xian Miaomiao looked to Her Lady Queen, she asked Chu Feng, “Succeeded?”

At that moment, Her Lady Queen was still sitting cross-legged in midair. Merely, her body was emitting a dazzling golden-bright light. It was as if she had turned into a golden statue.

The reason for that was because all of that golden water, without a single drop remaining, had been condensed onto Eggy by Chu Feng.

Not only had that golden water completely covered Eggy, it was also being assimilated into Eggy’s body. At this moment, it was undoing Eggy’s seal. Merely, no one knew how long it would take.

“The spirit formation has been successfully set up. However, I do not know whether or not it will be able to successfully undo Eggy’s seal,” As Chu Feng spoke, he reopened the World Spirit Gate and placed Eggy back into his World Spirit Space.

“Chu Feng, I can tell that you’ve exhausted yourself. Here, eat this,” As Xian Miaomiao spoke, she extended her palm, revealing ten special medicinal pellets which she handed to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that those ten medicinal pellets were treasures to restore one’s martial and spirit power.

Indeed, Chu Feng had truly exhausted his strength to set up the spirit formation for Eggy. It was only because he possessed extremely strong spirit power that he was able to continue using it for so long.

However, for the sake of setting up that spirit formation, Chu Feng had nearly exhausted all of his world spirit power.

Even if he recovered, it would take some time.

Thus, even though those ten medicinal pellets were extremely precious, Chu Feng did not refuse them. Instead, he swallowed all ten medicinal pellets.

The reason for that was because he did not possess any medicinal pellet that could restore his spirit power as well, as the ones that Xian Miaomiao handed him.

“Miaomiao, thanks,” Chu Feng said.

“There’s no need to be modest with me,” Xian Miaomiao said with a smile.

“Come, let’s return to the Elf Kingdom,” Chu Feng said.

“There’s no need,” Xian Miaomiao shook her head.

“Why is that?” Chu Feng asked in a confused manner.

“They have come to receive me already,” As Xian Miaomiao spoke, she flew toward the exit. Chu Feng followed closely behind her.

After exiting the cave, Chu Feng discovered that there was already an army from the Elf Kingdom standing outside the cave in an orderly manner.

They were the elite soldiers of the Elf Kingdom. Not to mention the other experts, there were even four Protectors and two Grand Elders present.

The person leading them emitted an extremely powerful aura. He was wearing green battle armor with a red mantle draped across his shoulder. This person... was actually the Ancient Era’s Elves’ Elf King.

“Little friend Chu Feng, it seems that you’ve succeeded?” Seeing that Chu Feng had come out of the cave, the Elf King walked over to Chu Feng.
