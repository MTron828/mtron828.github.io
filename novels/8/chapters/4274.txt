Chapter 4274 - Hidden Expert

“Immemorial Cosmos Map?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Master, is the Immemorial Cosmos Map some sort of treasure?”

Chu Feng grew interested upon hearing those words.

The word ‘immemorial’ brought upon great expectation toward Chu Feng.

After all, Chu Feng already knew that the Immemorial Era was a time even more distant and more mysterious than the Ancient Era.

The Immemorial Era was the true origin of martial cultivators.

“In short, this inheritance is remarkable.”

“As for exactly what it is, kiddo, you can slowly make guesses yourself,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a mischievous smile.

“This...” Chu Feng felt extremely helpless.

Wasn’t the Ox-nosed Old Daoist deliberately teasing him?

Exactly what sort of master did he end up becoming the disciple of?

Soon after, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist removed his spirit formation isolating Chu Feng and him.

After the spirit formation dissipated, Chu Feng discovered that there were not a lot of people around.

The majority of the vast crowd of hundreds of millions had left already.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not surprised by this scene.

Although he had used his ability to torment those people, the torture does not last forever.

Once the power of his spirit formation dissipates, those people will break free from the torture. Naturally, the first thing they would do would be fleeing from this area.

After all, they couldn’t possibly continue to remain here and wait for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to torture them again.

As such, apart from Grandmaster Tang Chen and others that possess a decent relationship with Chu Feng, the only people that remained were people that did not offend Chu Feng.

“How’d it go? Did you manage to obtain the inheritance?”

“Exactly what sort of inheritance was it?”

Grandmaster Tang Chen and others discovered that the stele had disappeared. They realized that Chu Feng must’ve obtained the inheritance.

“We’ve obtained the inheritance. As for what it is, that’s going to be a secret.”

“However, to world spiritists, this inheritance is something that they would yearn for in their dreams.”

Because of that, I will not be handing this inheritance to Chu Feng for the time being. As his master, I will have to enjoy its benefits first.”

“You can consider it his show of filial respect toward me. Hehe...” Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke with a vile smile.

“This...”

Hearing those words, the crowd felt completely speechless.

They all knew that Chu Feng managed to obtain that inheritance because he breached the chess formation and then defeated Lu Jie.

That inheritance should belong to Chu Feng.

Yet, Chu Feng’s master actually decided to keep it for himself. This was simply too excessive.

However, when they saw how Chu Feng was showing no complaint and instead smiling, the crowd knew that Chu Feng was not opposed to it.

Since even Chu Feng himself was not opposed to it, it would naturally be improper for the crowd to say anything.

Of course, they’ve all witnessed how ruthless the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was earlier.

Even if they possess objections, none would dare to voice it.

What the crowd didn’t know was that there were three other figures witnessing the sight of them being afraid of voicing their anger.

Those three people stood high above the clouds.

But, even though they were standing there, no one was aware of them.

Those three people were Fumo Shaoyu, Fumo Xin’er and Lady Gusu who was pretending to be their grandmother.

“This Ox-nose, he’s simply bullying people too much. Young master, should I go and teach him a lesson?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“What’s there to teach him a lesson about? Can’t you see how Chu Feng is smiling cheerfully? Even Chu Feng himself has no objection. This meant that the two of them possessed an extraordinary relationship and that Ox-nose is someone Chu Feng trusted,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“This Xin’er was foolish,” Fumo Xin’er said.

“You’re not foolish. Instead, you’ve had your head muddled by love.”

“As long as anyone took advantage of that Chu Feng, you will not be able to stand by idly and watch,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Lord young master, Xin’er hasn’t been muddled by love,” Fumo Xin’er’s complexion turned deathly pale after hearing those words.

“Haha. I’m just joking. Look how scared you became,” laughed Fumo Shaoyu.

“Young master, please don’t joke with Xin’er anymore,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“Okay okay. I won’t tease you anymore,” laughed Fumo Shaoyu.

“Young master, didn’t you come here for Chu Feng’s sake?”

“Why are we not showing ourselves?”

“Why must we observe in secret?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“Let us wait a while. There’s a hidden expert here,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“There’s a hidden expert? Who?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“No idea. But, that expert’s aura is simply unfathomable. That person is an expert that even I cannot handle,” right at this moment, Lady Gusu spoke.

“Lady Gusu also noticed it?” Fumo Xin’er realized that things were not that simple after hearing those words.

“Lord young master, are you also unable to determine who it is?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“I can only detect a slight aura intermittently. But, I cannot be certain who it is.”

“But, as this person has remained here the entire time, they must possess some sort of purpose.”

“Let us continue to observe. There must be a reason as to why that expert’s aura is not completely concealed. Soon, that person will definitely reveal themself,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

Hearing those words, Fumo Xin’er stopped asking more questions. Instead, she began to carefully size up the people below and the surroundings. She wanted to find out where that so-called expert was hiding or who he or she had disguised themself as.

Since it was an expert that not even Fumo Shaoyu and Lady Gusu could handle, that person must be someone very powerful.

While the appearance of such an expert in a desolate place like the Holy Light Galaxy might not affect them, it was unknown if it was a blessing or a curse to Chu Feng and others.

“Woosh---”

Suddenly, a figure flew down and landed before Chu Feng.

Seeing this person, the crowd’s expressions all changed.

The reason for that was because this person was Old Man Compliance.

Old Man Compliance was a rather cold and detached individual.

He was someone who would not involve himself in anything happening in the Holy Light Galaxy. He was also completely disinterested in everyone.

He has always been a lone operator. Although his reputation was outstanding, he was practically friendless.

But, everyone noticed that he was interested in Chu Feng today.

“Old Thing Compliance, you couldn’t possibly be planning to fight over my disciple, right?” The Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Old Man Compliance with a smile on his face.

“Brother, you need not worry. This old man had no intention to take a disciple.”

“Merely, I possess a task that I wish to seek young friend Chu Feng’s help with. Young friend Chu Feng, might you be willing to help me?” said Old Man Compliance.

“Senior, what help do you need?”

“Please speak away. As long as it’s something that this Chu Feng could help with, I will definitely help,” Chu Feng answered very courteously.

Chu Feng had benefited from the Ancient Compliance Castle.

He also had a decent impression of Old Man Compliance. Thus, he was very willing to help Old Man Compliance.

“Young friend Chu Feng, please follow this old man.”

As Old Man Compliance spoke, he soared into the sky and began to walk toward the Ancient Compliance Castle.

Seeing this, Chu Feng followed over.

After the two of them entered the Ancient Compliance Castle, Old Man Compliance took out a wooden case.

The case appeared very ordinary. But, there were three locks on the case.

Of the three locks, two possess keyholes. But, the lock in the center does not possess a keyhole. It was impossible to open that lock with an ordinary key.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I will be frank with you.”

“This old man is unable to open the lock in the center.”

“But, someone has prophesied that a person of the younger generation will appear in the Holy Light Galaxy.”

“That person of the younger generation will be able to ascend onto the Talent Steps’ third step.”

“Should that person of the younger generation appear, they will be able to help me open this lock.”

“Originally, this old man was skeptical of that prophecy.”

“But, after what happened today, I felt that I had no choice but to believe in it,” said Old Man Compliance.

“Thus, senior wanted me to help you open this lock?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right,” Old Man Compliance nodded.
