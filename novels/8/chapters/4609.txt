Chapter 4609: Selected

“How did that fellow get here? Is he really that capable as to be able to find this place so quickly?”

Song Yun gazed into the distance with a grim look in her eyes.

Following that, she concealed her own presence and hid by the side.

Not too long later, a silhouette suddenly appeared in the vicinity. He was one of the three prodigies from the Gongsun Clan, Gongsun Leiyu.

Gongsun Leiyu headed straight for the location where the stone door was, but due as the stone door had turned invisible, it was hard for him to find its exact location.

However, he wasn’t worried at all. He took out a scroll from his robe. Written on the scroll was the location of the stone door, as well as the constellation map required to summon it out. On top of that, there was also a blueprint containing a rather complicated formation.

“It’s here.”

Through copying the constellation map shown on the scroll, Gongsun Leiyu was able to easily summon the stone door.

“Heh...”

The emergence of the stone door didn’t surprise Gongsun Leiyu at all. Instead, he smiled casually to himself, as if it was only natural for him to have found this place.

Following that, he began walking toward the stone door to enter its premises.

Boom!

Uwa!

But all of a sudden, a powerful force descended from the sky, crushing Gongsun Leiyu down to the ground.

“This feeling... Martial power? Elder, why are you making a move against me? I am Gongsun Leiyu from the Gongsun Clan!”

Gongsun Leiyu was aware that the juniors here were unable to use their martial power; only those who had reached Martial Exalted level would be able to exert their cultivation. As such, his first thought was that it was one of the subordinates of the Wretched Black Demon who had made a move against him.

“Gongsun Leiyu, where did you obtain the scroll in your hands from?” an old and authoritative voice sounded in the air

Song Yun had disguised her voice to interrogate Gongsun Leiyu as she felt that it wasn’t reasonable for the latter to find this place so quickly. There was definitely something fishy going on here, and the scroll in his hands only further verified her doubt.

It was one thing if the scroll contained the location of the stone door, but it actually contained the constellation map needed to summon the stone door too. Other than that, there was also a formation blueprint. Song Yun, with her keen eyes as a world spiritist, could tell that it was the method to take control of the formation inside the cavern.

In other words, just the details contained on the scroll was more than enough to guarantee Gongsun Leiyu a slot in the matchmaking convention.

Something like this should have never fallen in the hands of a challenger like him, unless...

“Elder, I was the one who drew this on my own,” Gongsun Leiyu argued.

“How dare you lie in my presence? Are you tired of living?”

Song Yun intensified her oppressive might, exerting an even greater force on Gongsun Leiyu.

Loud creaking sounds could be heard from Gongsun Leiyu’s body. His bones were starting to crack under the pressure.

“AHHH! Elder, please spare me! I’ll speak, I’ll speak!”

Gongsun Leiyu cried in agony. With his life at stake here, he had no choice but to reveal the truth honestly.

As it turned out, the Gongsun Clan had bribed one of the elders controlling the formation here, and the scroll was given to him by that elder. The other two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan also had similar scrolls in their possession too. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With these scrolls, it could be said that the three prodigies of the Gongsun Clan were set to win the slots.

“How shameless! Tell me which elder it is that gave you the scroll?” Song Yun asked once more.

“Elder, I really don’t know! The scroll was given to me by one of the elders in my clan. I really don’t know who the elder in my clan obtained the scroll from!”

Gongsun Leiyu shook his head frantically.

“If you won’t speak, I guess I have no choice then.”

With a cold sneer, Song Yun exerted her oppressive might once more, causing Gongsun Leiyu to scream in pain.

Despite the tragic state he was in, Gongsun Leiyu kept begging for mercy. From the looks of it, it would appear that he really didn’t know who the elder was. However, that didn’t mean that Song Yun was planning to let him off.

“This feeling...?”

But all of a sudden, Song Yun’s expression darkened a little, and she quickly turned to look in the distance.

“I didn’t exert any martial power in front of the stone gate, but I still got noticed?”

A tight frown formed on Song Yun’s forehead. She glanced at the severely injured Gongsun Leiyu before making up her mind.

“I’ll spare your dog life!”

After saying those words, Song Yun took out a jadestone. The jadestone emanated a blinding radiance before forming a spirit formation gate.

Song Yun quickly stepped into the spirit formation gate, and the spirit formation gate vanished right after she entered.

When she finally emerged once more, she was already out of the Incubation Forest.

“Really, why must he be that interested in the Asura Graveyard? You were able to survive even before the Dark Demon, so make sure not to die to those dogs of the Gongsun Clan over that matchmaking convention.”

Song Yun muttered to herself while looking at the Incubation Forest before turning around to leave.

“That young friend over there, isn’t it inappropriate for you to leave just like that?”

Yet, before Song Yun could leave the area, an old man suddenly appeared right behind her.

This was the same old man who told Chu Feng that he would have a chance to approach the Asura Graveyard if he were to participate in the matchmaking convention. By Chu Feng’s standards, this old man was unfathomably powerful.

However, a smile emerged on Song Yun’s face upon seeing that old man.

“Elder Yunkong, do you really not recognize me? Well, I guess it doesn’t matter. Surely you should recognize this then, right?”

As Song Yun spoke, she took out a token and flashed it to the old man.

As soon as the old man saw the token, his pupils began to dilate.
