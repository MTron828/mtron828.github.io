Chapter 5068: Embarrassment of Defeat

Shoosh!

With a fling of his spear, Jiang Yuantai hurled the skewered Chu Feng down from the sky.

Boom!

Chu Feng was slammed into the ground with an enormous force that created a huge crater beneath him. He had already stopped moving altogether, but Jiang Yuantai didn’t let him off just because of that.

Jiang Yuantai descended from the sky and pointed his spear toward Chu Feng while placing his foot on the latter’s body. This was the movement Chu Feng had made in the prophecy.

“That’s all you amount to, Chu Feng. I gave you a chance, but you’re an utter weakling. Your master and your friends could have survived this ordeal, but they are now doomed to die because of how useless you are.”

After saying those words, Jiang Yuantai finally withdrew his leg and turned around. As he left, he suddenly burst into hearty laughter.

“That’s all the prophecy amounts to! The man in the prophecy has been defeated by me! Let’s see who else in the Eastern Region is able to stop our Pill Dao Immortal Sect!”

Those arrogant words were directed toward everyone present in the area, but no one dared to refute him. The cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy present in the area were already no different from prisoners on death row. Given the position they were in, they dared not to speak against Jiang Yuantai.

Chu Feng’s body suddenly began floating into the air before flying over to Sima Xiangtu’s side.

“You’re still conscious? Why aren’t you saying a word at all? Feeling defeated?” Sima Xiangtu glanced at the bloodied Chu Feng and sneered.

With a wave of his sleeves, he hurled Chu Feng into the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s arms.

“Zhuge Yuankong, do you see that? Your disciple might be talented enough to be deemed the number one prodigy of the Eastern Region, but he’s still no match for the other prodigies in this vast world of cultivation. The same goes for you as well.

“You’re once the strongest world spiritist of the Holy Light Galaxy, basked in glory and splendor. Yet, all you can do now is to watch helplessly as your disciple undergo such torture. Do you know why that’s the case? It’s because you’re too weak,” Sima Xiangtu mocked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist ignored him. Instead, he began channeling his spirit power to treat Chu Feng.

“Is there a need to treat him? He’s going to die anyway,” Sima Xiangtu said.

“All humans eventually meet their death. Why are you living then?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

“Hmph!”

Sima Xiangtu was displeased by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s attitude. It was one thing for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to put on such airs while he was weaker than him, but he had already obtained far greater power now.

Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist continued to face him without the slightest hint of fear. No matter how he tortured the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, the latter continued to treat him the same way as before, as if he was an outcast unworthy of respect.

“All humans eventually meet their death, but I have much time ahead of me whereas your days are already numbered,” Sima Xiangtu replied with a harrumph.

With a wave of his sleeves, he imprisoned Chu Feng, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Wang Yuxian, Princess Xiaoxiao, the Lady of Dao Sea, and the others into his confinement formation.

The world fell silent following that.

Be it the trapped cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy or the enslaved clan members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, all of them looked despaired. They thought that they were saved when the puppet army appeared. Even when Sima Xiangtu took control of the puppet army, they still clutched onto a sliver of hope.

During the duel between Chu Feng and Jiang Yuantai, they were vaguely aware that they wouldn’t be saved even if Chu Feng won, but they still prayed for his victory anyway. At least that would have proved that their Eastern Region wasn’t filled with just weaklings that others could trample at their whim. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But despite Chu Feng’s astounding talent, he still lost to Jiang Yuantai. That plunged them deeper into despair.

With Chu Feng’s defeat, the final sliver of hope in their hearts was extinguished. They didn’t dare to carry any expectations anymore.

“Sima Xiangtu, how did you obtain that military seal?”

Jiang Taibai headed over to Sima Xiangtu’s side and eyed the military seal in his hand.

“Lord Taibai, I obtained this from the Monstrous Spirit Clan. I’m not too sure about its exact background except that a mysterious elder had entrusted it to the Monstrous Spirit Clan. It’s just that the Monstrous Spirit Clan was too useless to grasp control of this military seal, so it ended up falling into my hands,” Sima Xiangtu replied honestly.

“You could have controlled the Eastern Region by yourself with that puppet army. Why do you need our powers? Is it really just to borrow our Immortal Cauldron? What are you intending to do with our Immortal Cauldron?” Jiang Taibai asked.

He had never been interested to know what Sima Xiangtu was planning to do with the Immortal Cauldron because he never thought that the latter was a threat. However, it would be foolish of him to continue underestimating Sima Xiangtu when he had such a powerful puppet army under his control. He realized that there might be more to Sima Xiangtu than he knew about.

Recalling the terrifying talent Sima Xiangtu had previously displayed, he was more certain than ever that they had to be wary of Sima Xiangtu.

“Milord, I’ve cultivated a special cultivation technique, but I was unable to make a breakthrough in it due to the limitations of my talent. However, I was able to find another alternative way to overcome my limits. As long as I turn these people into my nutrients, I’ll be able to advance to Half-God level.

“Due to the stringent requirements of the forging process, I require a treasure of the caliber of the Immortal Cauldron. That’s also why I’m deeply grateful to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect for the generous help you have offered me. Rest assured, I’ll fulfill the end of my promise,” Sima Xiangtu replied humbly.

“You really aren’t the one who divulged young master Kongping’s whereabouts?” Jiang Taibai asked.

“Milord, there’s no way I would have dared to do something as insolent as that, not to mention that I’m unaware of young master Kongping’s whereabouts,” Sima Xiangtu hurriedly explained.

“That better be the truth, or else not even these wooden puppets you have will be able to save your life,” Jiang Taibai sneered before walking away.

Sima Xiangtu kept his back lowered as Jiang Taibai and the other members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect left the area. It was only when all of them were no longer within sight that he finally dared to raise his head.

As he straightened his posture, the puppet army immediately took its position behind him. A faint smile slowly formed on his lips.
