Chapter 5368: The Fierce Ling Sheng’er

“But I don’t like to owe favors. State whatever request you have,” Ling Sheng’er said.

“What I did earlier wasn’t worth a mention, so you don’t need to think too much about it. However, I do have something I’d like to achieve here, and I’d be willing to pay an equivalent price if you could help me,” Chu Feng said.

“What is it?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

“I need Life Crystals,” Chu Feng said.

“Life Crystals? Are you trying to save someone?”

“Yes, it’s a friend of mine.”

“Your request puts me in a spot. Life Crystals are invaluable treasures, and they have to be awakened before they can be used,” Ling Sheng’er said.

“I’m aware of that. I can awaken them,” Chu Feng replied.

“You are able to awaken Life Crystals?” Ling Sheng’er’s eyes widened in disbelief when she heard those words.

“I have awakened them before,” Chu Feng said.

Ling Sheng’er stared at Chu Feng for several seconds before shaking her head, saying, “Chu Feng, may fate allow us to meet again.”

Leaving those words behind, she left via the spirit formation gate.

“You really have no filter at all. Do you know how difficult it is to awaken a Life Crystal?” Yao Luo also shook her head to express her disappointment in Chu Feng before leaving through the spirit formation gate too.

“It doesn’t look like that girl is going to help you,” Eggy said.

“It matters not. I didn’t bear much hope in her in the first place,” Chu Feng replied.

On the first floor, Jie Yu was still together with the elder. His face stiffened up when he saw Ling Sheng’er walking out of the spirit formation gate, but seconds later, he took the initiative to approach her.

“Miss Sheng’er.” Even someone of Jie Yu’s standing had to address her formally.

Yet, Ling Sheng’er walked away without even sparing a glance at Jie Yu.

Moments later, Yao Luo walked out of the spirit formation gate. She noticed Jie Yu too, but she paid him no heed and quickly caught up with Ling Sheng’er. She didn’t seem to think highly of Jie Yu either.

Accustomed to this, Jie Yu wasn’t fazed by their rudeness. Instead, he heaved a sigh of relief.

However, his face stiffened when he saw Chu Feng stepping out of the spirit formation gate seconds later. It was too much of a coincidence for the three of them to leave at the same time. An ominous feeling gripped his heart.

Jie Yu quickly rushed forward and asked, “Chu Feng, did you encounter anyone earlier?”

“I met two ladies. They should have just left the tower. You didn’t see them?” Chu Feng asked.

“Ssss!” Jie Yu gasped. “Did they make things difficult for you?”

“Not at all. We got along well,” Chu Feng replied.

“You got along well? Did you talk with them?” Jie Yu asked.

“We did talk a little,” Chu Feng replied.

“Damn. Are you sure they didn’t make things difficult for you?” Jie Yu asked once more.

“They didn’t. Why do you look so nervous? Are those two ladies difficult people to deal with?” Chu Feng asked.

“Saying that is a gross understatement. Ling Sheng’er is the little demon king of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Hardly any juniors dare to cross her path,” Jie Yu spoke via voice transmission, fearful that those words would reach Ling Sheng’er’s ears.

“She looked pretty docile,” Chu Feng replied.

“That’s only on the surface. She’s vicious through and through,” Jie Yu refuted.

“What did she do?”

Chu Feng was curious as to what Ling Sheng’er had done before since he didn’t think that Jie Yu was a timid person.

“Well… I can’t say that, but it’s best for you to steer clear of her!” Jie Yu said. “Speaking of which, I thought you came here to practice a martial skill. Why are you out so quickly?”

“I’m done,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ah. Are you coming by tomorrow too?” Jie Yu asked, thinking that Chu Feng had simply gotten tired and was resting for the day.

“No need for that. I have already mastered the skill,” Chu Feng replied.

“You have already mastered it? That’s fast,” Jie Yu exclaimed.

Even the elder also looked at Chu Feng in a different light.

Jie Yu escorted Chu Feng back to his accommodations, but much to their surprise, there were uninvited guests camping at the doorway. They were all juniors from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and the one leading the pack was a white-haired man. Judging from the fierce looks on their faces, it was safe to assume that they had come with malice.

Bai Yunqing had already gotten into a conflict with the white-haired man and the other juniors. Both sides had released their spirit power, and it looked like they were going to cross blows.

“Ling Chongdong, what are you doing?” Jie Yu roared.

Chu Feng and Jie Yu landed next to Bai Yunqing.

“Big brother Chu Feng, you don’t have to make a move here. I can deal with this myself,” Bai Yunqing said.

“You’re Chu Feng?” The white-haired man assessed Chu Feng from head to toe.

“I asked you what you are doing here!” Jie Yu bellowed once more.

“What am I doing here? I heard that you were defeated by the two of them, so I came here to get even with them for you. I should be the one asking what you are doing right now.”

The white-haired man looked at Jie Yu with surprised eyes. It looked as if Jie Yu was on close terms with Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing, which didn’t make any sense to him.

“Do you think I’ll need your help? Scram!” Jie Yu ordered coldly.

Those words made it clear that Jie Yu was siding with Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing.

“Jie Yu, did water get into your head? Why are you berating us when we are here to stand up for you? Have you submitted to those two outsiders after losing to them? Aren’t you embarrassed in the least?” The white-haired man looked at Jie Yu in disdain. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Jie Yu, have some backbone! It’s already humiliating enough to be defeated by outsiders, but how can you side with them too? Do you consider yourself a member of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

The other juniors also criticized Jie Yu as well.

Unfazed by their criticisms, Jie Yu was just about to speak up when a voice boomed from the sky above.

“Are you saying that those who help them aren’t worthy to be members of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

Two figures descended from the sky. It was none other than Ling Sheng’er and Yao Luo.

“Miss Sheng’er.”

The crowd quickly bowed to Ling Sheng’er.

“Are you going to say that I’m unworthy to be a member of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion too if I insist on helping the outsiders too?” Ling Sheng’er asked.

“Ah?”

“This…”

The crowd was put in a spot.

Even Jie Yu was taken aback as well. He hadn’t thought that Ling Sheng’er would speak up for Chu Feng.

“Miss Sheng’er, we didn’t know that you are acquainted with them,” the white-haired man hurriedly explained.

“Scram,” Ling Sheng’er coldly ordered.

The crowd shuddered in fear. Not daring to utter a single word of rebuttal, they fled in a fluster.

“Woah, that girl sure is fierce. Her words are much more intimidating than Jie Yu’s.” Eggy burst into laughter.

“Didn’t you say may fate allow us to meet again?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

He didn’t think that Ling Sheng’er had specifically come here to help him. Rather, it was more likely that she chanced upon this sight and decided to step in.

“Indeed. Isn’t it interesting how sometimes fate arrives that quickly?” Ling Sheng’er replied with a beautiful smile.

“Here, I’ll give this to you.”

Ling Sheng’er walked up to Chu Feng and opened up her hand, which caused a burst of light to spill out. It was a formation containing a Life Crystal.
