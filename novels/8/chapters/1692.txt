MGA: Chapter 1692 - Mysterious Old Man

“But, the Luo Family is currently facing a crisis; the people from the Black Fiend might come at any moment. Is it really proper for us to leave at such a time?” Du Wanwu understood what Chu Feng wanted to do. However, he was worried about the safety of the people from the Luo Family.

“Du Wanwu, I’ve discovered everything regarding the way you think. You possess a one-track mind that is unable to turn around at all.”

“When even the Luo Family knows about the importance of the rise and fall of their family, how could you, Du Wanwu, not know about it?”

“Back then, the Poison Demon was that impressive and dared to contend against the Three Palaces by himself.”

“Look at the Du Clan now. Not to mention contending against the Three Palaces, any random one of the Nine Powers would be able to completely exterminate your Du Clan.”

“As for you, you bear the heavy responsibility of reviving your Du Clan. That mission of yours is more important than any instruction left behind by your Ancestor, for if you are to die, it will be extremely difficult for the Du Clan to emerge in power again. At that time, you will be the one who is unfilial to your Du Clan.”

“Thus, rather than worrying about the Luo Family, you should worry about yourself first. You should go and obtain that Gu first. Moreover, the Luo Family is located right underneath the Five Poisons Mountain. If something is to happen, we will be able to hear it and return immediately.”

“If you are still worried, I can set up a spirit formation around here,” Chu Feng said.

After hearing what Chu Feng said, Du Wanwu’s expression changed. He became speechless for a long time. Then, after his mind settled, he looked at Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, I am truly inferior to you.”

“Why did you suddenly say that?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am not as talented as you. You also possess a much deeper understanding of principles than me. Most importantly, not only do you know principles, you can also act upon them.”

“As for me, my great downfall is that even if I understand the principles of something, I am oftentimes unable to act upon them. It is as you said, I have a one-track mind, and am stubborn. This is my shortcoming, something that I must change.”

“However, since I have already agreed to protect the Luo Family, I must keep my word. I, Du Wanwu, am someone who always keeps my promises,” Du Wanwu said.

“What exactly is your intention then? Are we going to retrieve the Gu or not? Du Wanwu, you should know that this is something concerning your Du Clan and not me, Chu Feng,” Chu Feng said.

“We’ll go. However, you must set up spirit formations around here to protect the Luo Family,” Du Wanwu said.

“I would have done that without you saying it. After all, Goudan’er and the Third Miss are both in the Luo Family. I do not wish for an unexpected accident to happen to them,” Chu Feng said.

Then, Chu Feng set up layer upon layer of spirit formations around the entire Luo Family. Not only were there defensive spirit formations and detection spirit formations, there were also trap spirit formations and concealment spirit formations.

At this moment, the Luo Family appeared to be no different when looked at from the outside, and Chu Feng’s spirit formations could not be seen either, but the Luo Family was actually covered with layers of traps. Not to mention Martial Kings, even ordinary Half Martial Emperors would undoubtedly die should they try to trespass into the Luo Family.

After setting up the spirit formations, Chu Feng and Du Wanwu proceeded to the Five Poisons Mountain.

The Five Poisons Mountain was very large. The reason why it was called the Five Poisons Mountain was because there had been five monstrous beast kings that appeared on this mountain. Those five monstrous beast kings were all very powerful, and were all experts in poison techniques.

Even though the five monstrous beast kings were now only legends, there were indeed a lot of poisonous insects and beasts on the Five Poisons Mountain.

These poisonous insects and beasts were all great materials for concocting medicines. Thus, they could be said to be quite valuable. This was also the reason why the Luo Family had fought against their enemy for control of the Five Poisons Mountain fifteen thousand years ago.

However, the Five Poisons Mountain was definitely not as simple as it appeared to be. Otherwise, the Poison Demon would not have chosen this place to cultivate the Gu that could only mature after ten thousand years.

The deepest region of the Five Poisons Mountain could be said to be a place that contained an enormous amount of poison. Each and every object there possessed poisonous properties. It was a forbidden area that ordinary people did not dare to enter.

At this moment, Chu Feng and Du Wanwu had already entered the deepest region of the Five Poisons Mountain. They were going straight for the location where the Gu was being nurtured, according to the map in their hands.

“Someone’s here?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s eyes flashed. He hurriedly stopped moving forward. Cautiously, he looked into the distance. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this moment, Chu Feng and Du Wanwu were in the deepest region of the Five Poisons Mountain. Even though this place appeared to have nothing peculiar in it, it actually gave off a very strong oppressive sensation. It was simply impossible for people underneath the Half Martial Emperor realm to reach this place.

However, in the direction where Chu Feng was looking, there was a lake. That was not an ordinary lake. The water in the lake was green and bubbling disgustingly. As the bubbles burst, they emitted extremely stinky odors. That was a poison lake.

Not to mention the water of that poison lake, merely the poisonous gas emitted by the lake had caused the surrounding hundred miles to be completely barren, without even grass growing.

However, an old man was actually sitting in midair above the poison lake. This old man had a fishing rod in his hand, and was actually angling above the lake.

This old man was the reason why Chu Feng started to act this cautiously.

This old man was as thin as a matchstick. He wore plain cyan cotton clothing. Looking from afar, he appeared no different from an ordinary old man. However, he emitted an immortal-like aura. From a single glance, one could tell that he was an extraordinary character.

“That man is truly powerful. In the records left behind by my Ancestor, he had written that the Five Poisons Mountain is extremely poisonous because there exist three thousand eight hundred and eighty three poison lakes on the Five Poisons Mountain.”

“These poison lakes are all incomparably dangerous. They are the reason why the depths of the Five Poisons Mountain have become a restricted area. Even we people from the Du Clan who have been associated with poison since birth are warned by our Ancestor to not enter the poison lakes should we come and retrieve the Gu in the future.”

“This is especially true for the poison lake before us. It is known to be the number one poison lake of the Five Poisons Mountain. The poison gas emitted from this poison lake is capable of forming poisonous substances. It is extremely powerful. If we are to approach the poison lake, we will definitely be attacked by those poisonous substances.”

“Yet, that man actually dares to fish in this place. He is clearly provoking those poisonous substances. His nerve is truly enormously large. Exactly who might he be?” Du Wanwu sized that old man up with his gaze and then revealed a cautious expression, because they did not know whether that old man might be a friend or foe.

After hearing what Du Wanwu said, Chu Feng looked to the map in his hand and discovered that the lake before them was indeed recorded on the map. Sure enough, this lake was extremely dangerous.

“Youngster, you are destined to meet calamities one after another.”

Right at this moment, that old man suddenly turned his gaze to Chu Feng. He actually spoke to Chu Feng.

“Senior, who might you be?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng had already realized that this old man was extraordinary, and might even be a Martial Emperor. Even if he was not a Martial Emperor, he would definitely be a peak Half Martial Emperor.

The reason for that was because he gave Chu Feng a feeling, the feeling of being unable to see through him. People that gave Chu Feng that sort of feeling were generally all people that were much more powerful than him.

“Don’t be afraid, I have come to help you,” The old man said with a smile.

“Help me?” Chu Feng started to frown upon hearing those words. He did not know who this old man was. His sudden appearance in this place had caused Chu Feng to be uneasy to begin with. And now, he actually declared that he had come to help him. This made Chu Feng even more certain that it was not a coincidence that this old man had appeared here. Likely, he had come for him.

“Senior, do you know who I am? Why have you come to help me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Heh...” Hearing those words, the old man smiled. Then, he said, “Chu Feng, while you can deceive others, you cannot deceive me.”

“Senior, exactly who might you be?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng immediately clasped his fist with one hand respectfully. Since this old man knew who he was, he was definitely an extraordinary person.

“Who I am is not important. The important thing is that I will help you,” The old man looked to Chu Feng with a smile.
