Chapter 5770: Cooperation

All of a sudden, Huangfu Jiangyao thought of a rebuttal. He pointed his finger at Chu Feng and asked, “You must have cheated. Otherwise, you would have felt pain when you stepped onto the stone platform earlier!”

Chu Feng chuckled softly and replied, “Is there a possibility that your young master’s pain tolerance is so bad that he can’t even take a little bit of suffering?”

“Nonsense! All of us have been on the Bloodline Dueling Platform before. We know how it feels. The stronger the bloodline, the greater the pressure, the more intense the pain. You didn’t feel pain and stress because your bloodline is too weak,” Huangfu Jiangyao argued.

“Big brother, I want to smash my fist into his face,” Little Fishy said as she clenched her fist.

She didn’t even want to bother with words anymore.

“Shut up! How shameless can you get? Are the Ancient Era’s Heavenly Clansmen sore losers?”

“We saw and felt the pressure exerted by Chu Feng’s bloodline earlier!”

“Miss Feng Ling is right. Your young master’s bloodline isn’t worth a fart before Chu Feng’s bloodline!”

“Ancient Era’s Heavenly Clan? A bunch of crap! All I see is a group of sore losers! Stop embarrassing yourselves here and return to the ground!”

…

A tirade of insults ensued, not giving Huangfu Jiangyao any chance to argue. They were from the surrounding crowd. They couldn’t tolerate it anymore and spoke up on Chu Feng’s behalf despite the risk that they might offend the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“You… You…”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Huangfu Jiangyao tried to retort, but his voice was drowned out by the crowd. He trembled in anger, but there was nothing he could do. Deep down, he knew that they had lost, but he simply didn’t want to acknowledge Chu Feng.

Weng!

A brilliant light shone from the square, as a small, circular spirit formation gate, around the size of a watermelon, appeared in the sky. A normal human being wouldn’t have been able to enter the spirit formation gate.

“What’s that? Has the Nine Heavens’ Zenith commenced?”

The spirit formation gate emanated a divine aura resembling that of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. This reminded the crowd that it was about time for the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s commencement, but the problem was that none of them could enter such a small gate.

“It’s time. I hereby announce the commencement of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. May the benefactors here have a wonderful experience. I’d like to add that even though all of you are here to compete for the title of the strongest, you aren’t allowed to make a move on one another. Otherwise, my master will sternly punish you,” Liu Kuo said.

“It really is the entrance to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s trial, but how can we enter such a small entrance?” The crowd wondered.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Just then, countless glowing talismans whizzed out of the spirit formation gate and flew toward everyone present. One of the talismans flew toward Chu Feng and fused into his body. He was immediately shrouded by a surge of teleportation energy.

Chu Feng was brought into another realm.

Soon, another two surges of teleportation energy appeared around him. It was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao.

Chu Feng chuckled at the sight, as he wondered if the Nine Heavens’ Zenith had done it intentionally. It was too much of a coincidence for him to be grouped with the two strongest prodigies of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

He looked at them and asked, “Are we going to fight?”

Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao were taken aback to see Chu Feng too.

“Chu Feng, I personally don’t detest you, but my position as a member of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion doesn’t allow me to work with you,” Ling Xiao said before rising into the air. Before leaving, he glanced at Jie Baobao and said, “This is my own decision. I have no qualms if you wish to work with him, and I promise to keep it a secret from the clan too.”

With that, Ling Xiao swiftly took his leave.

“This realm isn’t particularly big. It’s probably a formation prepared specifically for us. It’ll be more efficient to work together than to go on our own paths. I’m also quite curious to know how capable Lord Jie Ranqing’s son is,” Jie Baobao said.

“So, you wish to work with me?” Chu Feng asked.

“You can turn me down,” Jie Boabao replied.

“I have no reason to turn you down. Let’s explore the trial of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith together.”

Chu Feng began exploring the realm with Jie Baobao, and they soon discovered that this small realm was indeed a formation. They had to find the formation core and decipher it if they wanted to leave this place.

Due to how small this place was, they would occasionally bump into Ling Xiao.

Ling Xiao didn’t say a word about Jie Baobao’s partnership with Chu Feng, a sign that he respected Jie Baobao’s decision.

At the same time, Chu Feng also noticed that Jie Baobao was indeed a prodigious world spiritist on the same level as Ling Xiaoxiao. At least, their spirit power was on the same level.

As they traveled together, Chu Feng realized that Jie Baobao was a decent person. She was not particularly chatty, but she made sure to cooperate with Chu Feng at every turn. Still, it was hard to read a person’s true thoughts, so Chu Feng wanted to verify if she was truly sincere.

Soon, he found a chance to do so. He noticed a fortuitous encounter hidden in this realm that was beneficial to world spiritists, but it would require outstanding formation deciphering skills to claim the fortuitous encounter, and there was potential danger too.

Thus, Chu Feng proposed that he would decipher the formation while Jie Baobao protected him. Jie Baobao accepted the proposal.
