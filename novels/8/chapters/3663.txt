Chapter 3663 - World Spirit’s Weapon

“Do you know why I was in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm?” Yin Zhuanghong asked.

“I am actually very curious about that too. Might you be willing to explain it to me?” asked Chu Feng.

“I was interested in the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. However, it was only after I arrived in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm that I learned that the Ice Summit’s Nine Dragons Saint Cloak had already been retrieved by someone,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“That is truly a coincidence,” Chu Feng smiled in embarrassment.

“Actually, I’ve come to this place with a purpose in mind too,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“You’re very direct.”

“In that case, what is your purpose?” asked Chu Feng.

“The Divine Armament Villa’s Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“You’re talking about that red pagoda?” asked Chu Feng.

The Divine Armament Villa was very large, and had many buildings of all kinds. However, there was a single building that was particularly eye-catching.

It was a pagoda deep inside the Divine Armament Villa. That pagoda was fully red. Not only did it appear very strange, but there were also several thousand levels in it.

That red tower pierced through the clouds and deep into the sky. It was very magnificent to look at.

Furthermore, it was protected by a very powerful world spirit formation. Not even Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes were able to see through it. Thus, not even he knew what the situation inside the pagoda was like.

That said, the red pagoda was somewhat similar to what Yin Zhuanghong had described.

That was the reason why Chu Feng suspected that the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda was that red pagoda.

“That’s right,” Yin Zhuanghong nodded.

“What is it that you want to obtain from that pagoda?”

“You couldn’t possibly be thinking of taking away that entire pagoda, right?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.

Yin Zhuanghong was simply too cold of a person. Being together with her, even the atmosphere became extremely heavy. Chu Feng was not fond of this sort of atmosphere. Thus, he subconsciously started to joke around.

“You will also be interested in what’s inside that pagoda,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“Oh? Why don’t you tell me what might be inside then.” Said Chu Feng.

“Weapons for world spirits,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“Weapons for world spirits?” Chu Feng’s expression changed upon hearing those words. He who had sat down already immediately stood up.

Sure enough, Yin Zhuanghong had hit the mark.

If it were something else, Chu Feng might not be interested in it. However, after hearing that it was related to world spirits, Chu Feng was immediately interested, extremely interested.

Chu Feng had known Her Lady Queen for so long. Her Lady Queen had truly helped him enormously. He had always felt that he owed her.

Because of that, he had always wanted to give her something to make up to her and express his gratitude toward her.

Unfortunately, he had been unable to find anything suitable.

Yet, he had suddenly learned that there were actually weapons that world spirits could use. Naturally, Chu Feng wanted to obtain one for Her Lady Queen.

“There are a lot of different weapons for world spirits. However, what’s inside the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda are no ordinary weapons.”

“Those weapons were created especially for world spirits by an Ancient Era’s master world spiritist.”

“Perhaps those weapons would not be of much use should the world spirits return to their spirit world, but they’re extremely helpful to world spirits when they’re in our cultivator world,” Yin Zhanghong continued.

Yin Zhuanghong was someone that talked very little, someone who was habitually silent.

Chu Feng knew that she was saying so much because she wanted to pique his interest.

She was acting that way because she wanted his assistance.

“I am indeed interested. However, since they are possessions of the Divine Armament Villa, we couldn’t possibly steal them, no?” asked Chu Feng.

“Those weapons do not belong to the Divine Armament Villa. They have only been left in the Divine Armament Villa by a friend of the Villa Master.”

“That person has stated that if anyone is able to enter the pagoda, they can choose and take the weapons in the pagoda at will,” said Yin Zhaunghong.

“There’s such a thing? In that case, why didn’t you proceed to do that directly? Why are you mentioning this matter to me?” asked Chu Feng.

“It’s my first time here. If I am to mention it directly, it would be rather presumptuous.”

“Seeing that your relationship with senior Shoujian is quite good, I decided to mention this matter to you. Besides, I also need your help,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

“In that case, I’ll go and ask about this matter later. If it is truly as you stated, I am willing to cooperate with you,” said Chu Feng.

Seeing that Chu Feng had agreed to it, she did not say anything anymore, but only nodded.

Then, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong left the resting hall and returned to the main palace hall.

“Brother Chu Feng, what did you and Miss Yin de?”

“You actually even used a spirit formation to conceal yourselves. Could it be... he he, the two of you did something shameful?” Seeing that Chu Feng had returned, Kong Tianhui ran over to Chu Feng with a mischievous look on his face.

“Watch your mouth!”

Right after Kong Tianhui finished saying those words, an ice-cold gaze was cast toward him. It was Yin Zhuanghong.

Yin Zhuanghong’s gaze had turned particularly cold. Even though she was beautiful like a celestial fairy, her gaze frightened even someone as shameless as Kong Tianhui.

“Miss Yin, do you want me to help you teach him a lesson?”

Nangong Yifan arrived beside Yin Zhuanghong. Compared to Yin Zhuanghong, Nangong Yifan had a very clear look of anger on his face.

He seemed like he would immediately tear Kong Tianhui apart should Yin Zhuanghong give the order.

“No need.”

However, even though Nangong Yifan was showing such concern for her, Yin Zhuanghong responded very coldly. She left only two words and then returned to her chair and sat back down.

She did not choose to leave. Naturally, she was waiting for Chu Feng to mention the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda to Lord Shoujian.

“Kong Tianhui, curb that mouth of yours properly. Otherwise, no one will be able to save you.”

Even though Yin Zhuanghong had responded very coldly to him, Nangong Yifan still fiercely threatened Kong Tianhui.

“No one will be able to save me? My brother Chu Feng is standing right over there. Try touching me if you can.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Kong Tianhui went over to Chu Feng and looked to Nangong Yifan provocatively.

“Humph,” Nangong Yifan wanted to say something. However, after taking a glance at Chu Feng, he let out a cold snort, waved his sleeve and walked away.

Chu Feng had already left an enormous trauma upon him. Unless absolutely certain of victory, no matter how conceited he might be, he would not dare to challenge him again.

“Brother Kong, what you said earlier was indeed excessive,” Chu Feng looked at Kong Tianhui with slight rebuke.

“I had no malice at all. It’s merely a joke,” Kong Tianhui spoke with grievance.

“How could you casually joke around with a woman’s reputation and integrity? If someone is to joke like that about me, would you be able to tolerate it?” Kong Ci ran over and criticized her older brother.

“Your little sister is more sensible than you,” said Chu Feng.

“I got it. I was wrong,” Kong Tianhui finally realized his mistake. After saying those words, he deliberately ran over to Yin Zhuanghong and apologized to her.

Even though Yin Zhuanghong did not bother to pay attention to him, Kong Tianhui was filled with sincerity in his apology. The only thing he didn’t do was kneel down to her.

In the end, it was the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations that felt annoyed with Kong Tianhui and drove him away. Otherwise, he would likely have continued to bother Yin Zhuanghong until she finally forgave him.

At that moment, Chu Feng arrived before Lord Shoujian.

Chu Feng did not wish to beat around the bush. Thus, he directly asked Lord Shoujian about the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.

“The Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda?”

“Young friend Chu Feng, why did you suddenly mention this matter? You couldn’t possibly be interested in that Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda, right?”

Lord Shoujian was not only surprised after hearing what Chu Feng said, but the smile on his face also became stern. There was also a trace of resistance in his eyes as he looked at Chu Feng.

This caused Chu Feng’s heart to tense up. He was able to tell that Lord Shoujian seemed to not want him to enter the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.
