Chapter 5759: The Taste of Friendship

“This…”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master couldn’t maintain his composure anymore. The corners of his lips quivered, and he began breathing erratically.

The elders were so frightened that they dared not breathe loudly.

Seven Realms Sacred Mansion—Jie Tian.

Among their juniors who participated in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, there was only one person who was named Jie Tian, and that was the grandson of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

…

“Jie Tian has been eliminated? It has to be someone with the same name, right? There must be someone else in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion named Jie Tian too.”

“What’s going on? Why is there only one name for this massive elimination board?”

“Is Jie Tian the only one to be eliminated? This…”

Meanwhile, the crowd outside flew into an uproar.

…

In a cavern in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, Jie Tian glared at Liu Kuo with clenched jaws. He had just witnessed the latter writing his name on the board and even adding ‘Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’ in front, as if worried that others would think that it was someone with the same name.

“I nearly forgot to clarify your affiliation. It’s fortunate that I remembered it so that others won’t mistake you for someone else,” Liu Kuo said with a smile.

“You’ll regret this.”

Jie Tian’s temple veins were pulsing so much that it looked like they would pop. If he could, he would have torn Liu Kuo into shreds.

Liu Kuo was unfazed by Jie Tian’s threat. He shifted his finger to another Buddhist bead, and a divine Buddhist light shone down on Jie Tian, crushing him so firmly against the cavern that his features distorted. At this rate, Jie Tian’s body and soul would be destroyed.

After suppressing Jie Tian with his formation, Liu Kuo walked up to Jie Tian and leaned in till their faces were nearly pressed against each other.

“Benefactor Jie Tian, I might be a monk, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have a temper. Threaten me just once more, and I’ll really get nasty. The trial of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith is fraught with danger. No one will question a thing even if you vanish into thin air.”

After saying those words, Liu Kuo finally reigned in the formation.

Jie Tian collapsed from the cavern wall. He breathed frantically as if he was gasping for air, but how could a world spiritist of his level possibly suffer from a lack of oxygen? He was reacting in such a manner due to the immense pressure Liu Kuo had exerted on him.

“How dare you treat me like that? Do you really not fear our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Jie Tian placed a hand on his chest as he asked with a hoarse and weak voice.

“Hah! It has been more than a day or two since your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion coveted our Nine Heavens’ Zenith. If your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is really that capable, our Nine Heavens’ Zenith would have long become yours,” Liu Kuo said.

“The Nine Heavens’ Zenith is only strong because of its formation. It has nothing to do with you,” Jie Tian said.

“Speaking of formations, your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion prides itself on its ability to deal with formations. Why haven’t you people deciphered our Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation yet?” Liu Kuo asked.

“Don’t you dare underestimate our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.” Jie Tian glared at Liu Kuo despite being in a weakened state. He truly cared about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s dignity.

“You should get things right. I have never underestimated the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion; you’re the one who is underestimating our Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Liu Kuo said before taking his leave.

Jie Tian was frustrated, but he knew there was nothing he could do. The cavern was sealed by the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation. He wasn’t strong enough to breach the formation, so he had no choice but to wait till he was freed.

“Next time, I’ll let all of you know what I, Jie Tian, am capable of,” Jie Tian solemnly vowed to never land in such a pathetic state the next time he met Chu Feng, Xianhai Yu’er, and Liu Kuo.

…

Meanwhile, Chu Feng, Little Fishy, and the others were busy working on their respective tasks. The men were busy catching fish and prawns, while the women prepared the cooking utensils and sauces.

In the end, they made an entire table of dishes.

These dishes were cooked via traditional cooking methods instead of conjuring via spirit power, so they actually weren’t that tasty. None of the dishes were satisfactory in appearance, fragrance, or taste, but Chu Feng and the others still relished them.

These dishes were lacking, but it was nothing compared to the suffering they went through in the path of cultivation. Above all, they had to show respect to the chef. Long Chengyu showed the most respect by eating and drinking the most.

“I, Long Chengyu, swear that this is the most unforgettable meal I have ever eaten in my lifetime,” Long Chengyu said with a slightly reddened face.

He wouldn’t get really drunk by drinking, though he was a bit different than usual. His slightly drunk state was rather interesting to watch.

“Brother Long, you’re too courteous. Why don’t you say that it’s the worst meal you have ever eaten?” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

A smile emerged on Long Muxi’s slightly reddened face, but Little Fishy, Feng Ling, and Xian Miaomiao pouted in discontentment. They couldn’t accept Xianhai Shaoyu’s evaluation.

“No, it isn’t. It’s rare to have such a meal. It has been a long time since I have been so happy. It’s the happiest meal I had since the rebellion in the Totem Dragon Clan,” Long Chengyu said.

The crowd fell silent. They had heard about what happened in the Totem Dragon Clan.

Someone had usurped the position of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, and Long Chengyu was the young master of the Totem Dragon Clan. No matter how nonchalant he appeared, there was no way he was truly unfazed about it.

They could imagine the stress he was facing.

“I’m speaking the truth! Brother Chu Feng, why don’t you be the judge here and tell us whether this meal is good or not, and whether you enjoyed it or not?” Long Chengyu asked.

“To be frank, this meal is horrendous, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is the taste of friendship. Come, let’s raise our cups and toast to our friendship!” Chu Feng said as he raised his cup.

The crowd stood up. “Yes! To friendship!”

Beaming smiles could be seen on everyone’s faces. They ate and chatted till nightfall. They still didn’t want to part ways then, but Chu Feng took out several scrolls and distributed them to the group.

“I figured out a few ways to better utilize the cultivation ground. You should benefit more from it if you cultivate via my method,” Chu Feng said.

The crowd wasn’t motivated to return to their residences as they thought that the cultivation ground wasn’t particularly effective, but they decided to return and try Chu Feng’s method out of trust for him.

“Brother Shaoyu, this ought to belong to you.” Chu Feng presented the pearl he got from Huangfu Shengyu to Xianhai Shaoyu as he walked them out.

Xianhai Shaoyu hadn’t gone all out in his first fight with Huangfu Shengyu. He was actually planning to step on the dueling ring, and there was a good chance he could have defeated the latter the second time.

“Brother Chu Feng, do you think our Immortal Sea Fish Clan lacks cultivation resources? Keep it. If you wish to make up to me, you should sleep beside me tomorrow.”

“What’s wrong with you?!” Little Fishy exclaimed as she hurriedly dragged Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu apart. “Big brother, you better stay away from my brother in the future. There’s something wrong with him. You don’t know what kind of depraved materials he read.”

At the same time, she grasped the hand Chu Feng was holding the pearl with and closed it, subtly telling him to keep it for himself. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“What depraved materials? How can you spout such lies? Little sisters really can’t be trusted. How upsetting. Brother Chu Feng, I don’t want my little sister anymore. You may have her.” Xianhai Shaoyu wiped off his invisible tears and walked away, but there was a beaming smile on his face.

“I’ll be heading off first, big brother. Work hard for your cultivation!” Little Fishy merrily bade her farewell before chasing after Xianhai Shaoyu. “Stinky brother, wait for me!”

The others smiled. They could tell that those two siblings were on close terms. Long Chengyu even felt a bit envious of their bond, as he wished he and his older sister could be the same.

“Chu Feng, I’ll be heading back to cultivate now. See you tomorrow,” Xian Miaomiao said with a radiant smile.

“See you tomorrow,” Feng Ling joined in.

The group bade their farewell one by one.

Instead of returning to his residence to rest, Chu Feng sat down on the spot and took out the two pearls he had received earlier in the day. He knew that these two pearls were top-notch cultivation resources, and he was planning to use them right away!
