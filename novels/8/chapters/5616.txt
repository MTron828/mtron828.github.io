Chapter 5616: Luring Into the Slaughter Formation

“What a despicable brat! So what if you succeeded? You can’t kill me even if I stand still here. This is the gap in our cultivation level!” the gray-robed old man shouted, possibly because he was angry at having fallen for Chu Feng’s ploy.

Instead of saying anything, Chu Feng pressed his palms together and raised them into the sky. A flood of spirit power rushed into the sky and manifested into a gigantic spirit formation sword that boasted a length of over ten thousand meters.

The surrounding space trembled as if it was frightened of the sword. There was no question that this sword harnessed frightening prowess.

“It’s indeed difficult to overcome the gap in our cultivation levels. Since that’s the case, you should stand there and allow me to do my work,” Chu Feng said as he swung the sword down upon the gray-robed old man. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Asking me to stand still while you attack me? You must take me for a fool!” the gray-robed old man sneered as he pointed his Exalted Armament saber against the spirit formation sword.

Despite the incredible size difference between the two, the gray-robed old man’s Exalted Armament saber instantly shattered Chu Feng’s massive spirit formation sword into pieces. Furthermore, he secretly released a wave of saber qi toward Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was able to easily dodge it once again with his Divine Flitting.

By this point, it was already obvious that he was no match for the gray-robed old man, so he decisively fled deeper into the mountain.

I might not be able to defeat you, but surely I can escape from you.

“Do you think that you can escape from me?”

The gray-robed old man immediately gave chase even though he was shocked by Chu Feng’s speed.

Chu Feng made sure to maintain a steady pace, such that the gray-robed old man could follow but not catch up with him. This convinced the gray-robed old man that he had a shot at catching up with Chu Feng, which made him give chase even more fervently while unleashing attacks.

It was futile.

Chu Feng impeccably evaded his attacks, and the distance between the two of them never got any closer. None of the attacks landed on Chu Feng even though they looked like close shaves.

“Old thing, you’re weaker than I thought. I never thought that the Immortal Slaughterer would send such a weak fellow after me. You must be either the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven or a disciple. It’s one thing for that young man I killed earlier, but aren’t you too old to be someone’s disciple? You better scram, or else I’ll be taking your life!”

Chu Feng continued to run his mouth as if he had the upper hand here.

“You brat! Song Luoyi is your grandmother, right? You’re looking down on me now, but your grandmother died before my eyes back then. She sure was pitiful!” the gray-robed old man sneered, using Chu Feng’s grandmother to mock him.

“Are you trying to provoke me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Provoke you? You think too highly of yourself. You don’t know what we, the Immortal Slaughterer, are capable of! Do you think that the world revolves around you just because you’re fast on your feet? To me, you’re already a fish on the chopping board, the same as your grandmother was to me back then. I can kill you whenever I want to. Your pathetic attempt to escape is nothing more than a farce to me,” the gray-robed man spoke with confidence.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng suddenly accelerated after crossing a mountain, disappearing in the blink of an eye. The gray-robed old man panicked upon witnessing that sight. How could he allow the prey in his grasp to escape?

Thus, the gray-robed old man used an unknown means that considerably increased his speed. Even though Chu Feng was nowhere in sight, he was still able to track Chu Feng’s escape route through his lingering aura.

He desperately pursued Chu Feng across several mountains before the latter appeared before his eyes once more. At this point, Chu Feng’s speed had slowed down, and he was gasping for air with a panicked look.

“Hahahaha!” The gray-robed man burst into laughter. “You look awfully tired. Your escape means must have taken a toll on you. This is the end of you!”

The speed Chu Feng had displayed earlier far surpassed the limit of a rank six Half-God level cultivator, so the gray-robed old man deduced that the other party’s exhaustion was the result of having used some kind of powerful escape means.

Weng!

Just as the gray-robed old man was about to catch Chu Feng, the surrounding mountain suddenly emanated a brilliant light. The brilliant light was coming from runes inscribed onto the mountain, and together with it came a terrifying pressure.

Realizing that something had gone awry, the gray-robed old man turned tail and fled, but a powerful surge of spirit power suddenly enveloped him and held him in place. The gray-robed old man quickly brandished his Exalted Armament saber to slice through the barrier, but it was to no avail. It was like water droplets pattering on a boulder.

That sent the gray-robed man further into panic.

Just then, Chu Feng let out a cold laugh. He was standing in the middle of the slaughter formation, looking at the gray-robed old man with a composed but eerie smile.

“What are you laughing at? You’re in this slaughter formation too! I’ll pull you down with me even if I die!” the gray-robed man screamed.

“Is that so?” Chu Feng replied with a smile before he suddenly dissipated as a whiff of spirit power.

Moments later, another voice echoed from another direction. Chu Feng was in the direction of where they had come from, but what was more important was that he wasn’t standing inside the slaughter formation but outside.

“Do you know why I told you to stop giving chase?” Chu Feng sneered as he looked at the gray-robed old man with impassive eyes as if the latter was dead meat.

“How did you pull this off right beneath my eyelids?” the gray-robed old man roared in disbelief.

He finally understood that he had been tricked!
