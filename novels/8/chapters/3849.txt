Chapter 3849 - Practically A Benefactor

“Mystic Cave Saints, since you have lost, you should honor your promise, no?” said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Rest assured. We, the Mystic Cave Saints, have always kept our word.” as the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints spoke, he took out the Yin-Yang Soulsealing Rope.

However, he did not directly hand it to the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster. Instead, he first looked to Chu Feng with a bitter and grude-filled gaze.

“Fuck it all! Never would I have expected that I’d be screwed by you again, damned brat.” the Mystic Cave Saints’ Eldest said with great displeasure.

After he finished saying those words, he flipped his sleeve and threw the Yin-Yang Soulsealing Rope to the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Do you want to have another go?” Chu Feng asked the Mystic Cave Saints with a beaming smile.

“Another go my ass. Little brat, I’ve remembered you.” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints with great displeasure.

“Since the outcome has been decided, you all can leave." said the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land.

This was actually the first time they’d met the Mystic Cave Saints in the flesh.

In the past, they’d only heard rumors about them. Only their Lady Headmaster had been in direct contact with them.

At that moment, the Mystic Cave Saints had left a very deep impression on them.

It was precisely because of that deep impression that they wanted the Mystic Cave Saints to scram out of their Red-dress Holy Land right away.

In fact, merely having them scram was already being very polite and courteous.

If it wasn’t for taking etiquette into consideration, they would’ve rushed out to teach them a lesson by beating them up, and then kicking them out afterwards.

After all, the Mystic Cave Saints were simply too shameless.

Fortunately Chu Feng had been present. Otherwise, they would’ve suffered major losses.

“Rest assured, even if you all wanted to keep us here, we would not stay in your lousy place. We shall never meet again." The Mystic Cave Saints’ Eldest prepared to leave after saying those words.

“Wait.” The Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster spoke all of a sudden.

“What do you want?”

“Could you be planning to restrain us here, and then handing us over to Yuan Shu?”

“Let me tell you this explicitly. It was not us who cheated to get into the World Spirit Mansion Gate. You should not believe that little brat’s framing of us.”

“If you all insist on believing him and falsely accusing us, I will tell you this... we, the Mystic Cave Saints, are not so easily bullied." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“You’re mistaken. That is not my intention.”

“As the saying goes, those who come are guests. Since you all have come here, we, the Red-dress Holy Land, shall naturally act as hosts, and treat you all with due respect.”

“Everyone, why don’t you stay in our Red-dress Holy Land for several more days?”

“Our Red-dress Holy Land just so happens to possess several treasures related to world spirit techniques that we would like to ask Grandmasters to help decipher.” said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

Chu Feng noticed that the Mystic Cave Saints had originally showed no intention of staying. However, once they heard the word ‘treasures.’ their gazes immediately changed.

They all turned their gazes to their Eldest brother, and were seemingly waiting for him to make a decision.

“Very well. Although your Red-dress Holy Land’s elders truly lack manners, they are, in the end, only elders. We will not lower ourselves to their level.”

“Since Headmaster Red-dress intends to invite us to stay as guests, we will naturally have to give Headmaster Red-dress face,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

Once he said those words, the expressions of the Red-dress Holy Land’s elders all turned very ugly.

Even Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from cursing the Mystic Cave Saints for being shameless in his heart.

He had clearly stated that they would not stay even if the Red-dress Holy Land invited them to stay. Yet, right after the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster spoke, they immediately decided to stay.

Even though Chu Feng knew that they were only interested in the treasures that the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster spoke of, their skin was still simply too thick.

That being said, the curtains had finally dropped on the matter.

Being miserably defeated, Zhang Duotuo found it embarrassing to continue to stay around.

He found it even more embarrassing to mention the marriage again.

Because of that, he had taken Meng Rufei and left with his tail between his legs on the same day.

The Red-dress Holy Land did not have any intention to urge him to stay either.

After all, if it wasn’t for Chu Feng’s help, they would have suffered major losses all because of Zhang Duotuo.

As for Chu Feng, due to his involvement and winning twice against all odds, allowing the Red-dress Holy Land to become the final victor in the gamble, he became someone who had contributed great merit to the Red-dress Holy Land.

Unavoidably, the Red-dress Holy Land prepared a major feast and an ample amount of gifts to express their thanks to him.

All of the elders were present at the feast. Even the elite disciples were present. Naturally, Yin Zhuanghong and the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster were also present.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that the Mystic Cave Saints were actually also present.

Furthermore, they arrived unsolicited, and were eating and drinking with glee. It was as if they were the main characters of the feast.

It truly must be said that they possessed extremely thick skin.

After the feast, the Mystic Cave Saints really ended up staying in the Red-dress Holy Land.

That said, Chu Feng did not have any interactions with them. Thus, he was rather indifferent to the matter of them staying.

Chu Feng felt that the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster’s decision to have the Mystic Cave Saints, dangerous as they might be stay, was most definitely not because of needing their help for simply deciphering some treasures.

After all, if she needed help to decipher treasures, she could very much ask for Chu Feng’s help. There was simply no need to request the Mystic Cave Saints’ help.

The Mystic Cave Saints were completely devoid of morality and baseline. Their eyes had shone upon hearing the word ‘treasures.’

As the ruler of the Red-dress Holy Land, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster couldn’t possibly not know how dangerous the Mystic Cave Saints were. Asking them to stay was simply akin to inviting tigers into one’s home.

Thus, Chu Feng suspected that the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster must have her own reason as to why she wanted the Mystic Cave Saints to stay. Merely, he had no idea what her reason was.

That being said, after that day, Chu Feng’s treatment in the Red-dress Holy Land had changed enormously.

In the past, Lil Xin was the only one who would bring him dimsum every day, and Yin Zhuanghong was the only person who would come to see him every day.

However, after Chu Feng defeated the Mystic Cave Saints, the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land came to pay him a visit every day.

In fact, even the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster would occasionally visit him.

Most amusing of all, the Red-dress Holy Land’s elders would sometimes bring their own personal disciples to pay Chu Feng a visit.

Although they would speak rather ambiguously, they were implying that they wanted to introduce their disciples to him in the hopes of creating a connection for a potential marriage.

Chu Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

After all, not every elder’s disciple was an outstanding beauty. Some... were difficult to describe with words...

Of course, Chu Feng had no interest in them regardless of their looks.

It had been a very long time since he had been attracted to anyone. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ever since he had Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei in his heart... his heart seemed to be completely full, unable to contain anyone else.
