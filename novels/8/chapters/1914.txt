Chapter 1914 - A Legend

“There’s more. Many people felt that what was hidden within the Blood Devouring Killing Formation were treasures. However, the reality is different. The Blood Devouring Killing Formation actually contains ferocious beasts from the Ancient Era sealed within it,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Ferocious beasts from the Ancient Era? Is what you said for real?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, it is the truth. That is why we Ancient Era’s Elves were worried about the Blood Devouring Killing Formation’s power weakening the entire time. We were worried that it would not be able to continue keeping those Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts sealed. After all, if those Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts break through the Blood Devouring Killing Formation, they will bring about a catastrophe to the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“The reason for that is because the sealed Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are the same as our Holy Land of Martialism’s ferocious beasts. They do not possess any intelligence, and only know about killing. Blood-thirstiness is their nature. However, there is a big difference between the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts and the current Holy Land of Martialism’s ferocious beasts. That is, the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are much more powerful. They are simply not something that the ferocious beasts that we have now can compare to,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“In that case, you’re saying that the Holy Land of Martialism will, sooner or later, be met with a catastrophe?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right, the Holy Land of Martialism is destined to be met with a catastrophe. However, I am looking forward to that day,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Why is that?” Chu Feng started to frown slightly as he asked in a very confused manner.

“Think about it. How interesting of a thing would it be to kill an Ancient Era’s ferocious beast?” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Oh you. If the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are to appear, how many innocent people will die tragically?” Chu Feng said.

“Your words are incorrect. Those people are weak. As such, they can only fall prey to such a thing.”

“The world of martial cultivation is a world where the weak are prey to the strong. Even if there aren’t any ferocious beast to kill the weak, they will still end up suffering humiliation from their fellows,” Xian Miaomiao said.

Chu Feng did not refute her, because what Xian Miaomiao said was indeed the truth. Homicide was something that happened everyday in the Holy Land of Martialism.

“It’s okay, I was merely joking with you.”

“Rest assured. As we Ancient Era’s Elves know about this matter, we naturally have already made preparations for it.”

“Actually, there are Ancient Era’s Elves guarding the outside of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation the entire time. If the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are to break through the spirit formation, we Ancient Era’s Elves will immediately surround them and kill them,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“But those Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are sealed in this place. As such, how could they possibly be that easy to take care of?” Chu Feng asked.

“We possess special means to take care of them. You can rest assured,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Okay then,” Chu Feng smiled slightly. After hearing what Xian Miaomiao said, he indeed felt much more at ease.

Afterward, Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao continued to journey deeper into the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. While they journeyed, they were talking and laughing.

This did not mean that the Blood Devouring Killing Formation was not dangerous. Rather, it was that Chu Feng’s perception was simply too powerful. All the traps and mechanisms in this place were easily avoided by Chu Feng.

Furthermore, Chu Feng discovered that even though Xian Miaomiao’s world spirit techniques were not powerful, her perception was very strong. She was able to discover all of the dangers that Chu Feng had discovered.

Thus, even without Chu Feng here, all the traps and mechanisms of this place would likely not be able to harm Xian Miaomiao.

However, the most astonishing fact regarding the Blood Devouring Killing Formation was that there was clearly an innumerable amount of people from both the Ancient Era and after the Ancient Era that had died here. Yet, on their journey, Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao had not encountered a single skeleton.

Chu Feng speculated that this was also related to the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. The Blood Devouring Killing Formation was a slaughtering formation that would not even leave the bones of the victims that it killed. It was truly a slaughtering formation.

After a period of traveling, Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao finally arrived at the Blood Devouring Killing Formation’s central region.

It was a vast spirit formation. One could distinguish this spirit formation using the naked eye. This spirit formation was so tall that it reached the clouds in the sky. It looked like a fort, yet not like a fort. In short, it was enormous. Furthermore, there were entrances to this spirit formation in all directions.

Most shockingly, as Chu Feng looked from outside the spirit formation, he discovered that the Blood Devouring Killing Formation’s most dangerous location, the center, was actually completely different from the outside.

The outside was covered with blood. Merely the scenery of this place was capable of causing enormous shock.

However, the inside actually contained flowers, plants, trees and everything else. There were enormous trees that reached the skies. There were flowers that were as big as a palace. All of them were present inside.

At a glance, the inside was like a paradise. How could it possibly look like the most dangerous place?

“Wow, it is truly extraordinary,” At that moment, Xian Miaomiao suddenly removed her Blood Devouring Armor.

Chu Feng then came to a sudden realization, then also removed his Blood Devouring Armor. After he removed his Blood Devouring Armor, Chu Feng was able to feel an enormous pressure from the spirit formation, even though he was standing outside. The pressure was pounding against his body in waves.

The pressure caused one’s hair to stand on end, and one’s bones to make creaking noise. He felt as if he would be immediately annihilated the moment he entered that spirit formation.

“It seems that it is not only the Blood Devouring Insects that can exist in here. Those special plants are also capable of surviving in here,” Chu Feng gasped with admiration.

“That’s true. Merely, we can use special means to lure the Blood Devouring Insects out and make use of them. As for those plants, there’s nothing that we can do about them,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Well then, let’s enter.” As Chu Feng spoke, he put the Blood Devouring Armor back on and stepped into the spirit formation. Xian Miaomiao also followed closely behind him.

“It seems that the center of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation is even more vast than I imagined it to be. This place is truly enormous,” After entering the central region, Chu Feng gasped with admiration. This place was simply like an entire separate world.

“Miaomiao, how is it? Are you able to sense the location of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers?” Chu Feng asked.

Xian Miaomiao shook her head and then said with a determined expression, “I can’t. However, I’m certain that there are Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers in here.”

“Are you unable to sense anything at all right now?” Chu Feng asked again.

Xian Miaomiao shook her head again.

At that moment, Chu Feng realized that this place was truly not as simple as he had imagined it to be. It was not a place where they could discover Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers the moment they entered.

“No rush. This place is very large. Let’s look around carefully,” Chu Feng said.

Afterward, Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao began to carefully search the area around them. Originally, the two of them traveled extremely slowly. Later on, they began to speed up. The reason for that was because this place was truly too big. If they were to slowly search one step at a time, they would likely not be able to search through this entire place even after spending several decades searching. Thus, they had to accelerate their speed.

Suddenly, Xian Miaomiao said, “Chu Feng, I have a bad feeling. There are definitely Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers in this place. But... but, my innate response to the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers has been cut off. I am unable to sense them.”

“Miaomiao, you might be overthinking it. Even if there are Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers in this place, it is impossible for them to be everywhere. Let’s continue to search for them,” Chu Feng said.

“Okay,” Xian Miaomiao became low-spirited. This was the first time that Chu Feng had seen her behaving in such a manner. It could be seen that she deeply longed to find Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

That being said, this girl was truly optimistic. Even though Chu Feng did not try to console her, she managed to quickly adjust her frame of mind shortly afterward, and started to talk and laugh once again.

Furthermore, it was very easy to encounter Blood Devouring Insects in this place. All the Blood Devouring Insects that the girl managed to encounter were unable to escape her evil clutches.

However, that was something that Chu Feng could understand. After all, Blood Devouring Insects were capable of being manufactured into Blood Devouring Armors. If their special effect were to become known, they would definitely be able to fetch a very good price.

However, Chu Feng felt that there was simply no need to waste the energy to capture Blood Devouring Insects. The reason for that was because the plants and trees of this place were all capable of resisting that enormous, special pressure. Thus, the plants and trees of this place were all equivalent or even more valuable than the Blood Devouring Insects.

Chu Feng was planning to bring a some plants and trees with him before leaving this place. He planned to make armors that could withstand this place’s pressure in the future. He knew that those armors would definitely fetch a great price.

Suddenly, Xian Miaomiao asked, “Chu Feng, did you know that there’s actually a legend about the Blood Devouring Killing Formation?”
