Chapter 3154 - Offering An Apology

The people that came out were four men and a woman. They were all older than Chu Feng. They were all roughly older than two hundreds, though nowhere near three hundred.

However, their cultivations were all very powerful. The weakest among them, the woman, was a rank three Heavenly Immortal, the same cultivation as Chu Hongyi.

As for Chu Hongyi, he was the strongest member of the Chu Heavenly Clan before Chu Feng arrived.

As for the person with the highest level of cultivation among the five, he was actually a rank seven Heavenly Immortal, a cultivation a level higher than Chu Feng before he managed to have his breakthroughs.

Thinking back, the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen that Chu Feng had encountered on his way were all Heavenly Immortals.

From this, it could be seen that the Dongguo Heavenly Clan was much stronger than their Chu Heavenly Clan.

It was no wonder the Dongguo Heavenly Clan would possess such status in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

“You are from the Chu Heavenly Clan, you actually still have the nerve to come to our Dongguo Heavenly Clan?”

That woman looked to Chu Feng with an expression of displeasure. Her eyes were filled with disgust.

Actually, it was not only her. Those Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen were all looking at Chu Feng with ill-intended gazes.

“I have only just recently arrived in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. After finding out about the conflict between my seniors and the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, I decided to come here and represent my clan to offer an apology,” Chu Feng spoke with his fist clasped. His attitude was very courteous.

There were two reasons as to why Chu Feng was acting so courteously.

First, he had come with a request for the Dongguo Heavenly Clan. As such, he would naturally have to act humbly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Secondly, based on what Chu Ping had told him, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan had treated their Chu Heavenly Clan very well back then. It was their Chu Heavenly Clan that had let the Dongguo Heavenly Clan down.

As Chu Feng had come with a request and was representing the Chu Heavenly Clan to apologize to them, he would naturally have to lower his posture

Chu Feng was not lowering himself. Instead, he was showing etiquette.

“Representing the Chu Heavenly Clan? You?”

“Go. Get lost. If your Chu Heavenly Clan wants to apologize, have that Chu Hongyi come here and apologize,” That woman spoke with great contempt.

“Our Chu Heavenly Clan has been allies with the Dongguo Heavenly Clan for many generations. Whilst what Chu Hongyi and my other seniors did was truly inappropriate, we cannot sever the relationship between our two clans because of something like that.”

“If you all still have grievances in your heart, this Chu Feng will apologize to you all on their behalf,” As Chu Feng spoke, he bowed to the five Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen.

“Go on back. Chu Hongyi must be the one to come. Furthermore, even if he is to come, he must kneel before us and slap himself until we are satisfied. Otherwise, our Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm will definitely not reestablish our friendly relationship with your Chu Heavenly Clan.”

One of the men among the five seemed to not want to make things difficult for Chu Feng, and casually waved his hand at him.

“I, Chu Feng, have come with full sincerity today. If I am unable to obtain the Dongguo Heavenly Clan’s forgiveness, I will not be leaving,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well. Why don’t you kneel, beg for forgiveness and slap yourself until we are satisfied?” said the woman as she pointed at Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled lightly. He said, “I’m afraid that you will not be able to make that decision. How about this: go and call out the person that is capable of making that decision.”

“Yoh-ho, you are starting to climb all over us eh? What makes you think you are qualified to speak to our big sis Bingyu? Scram!”

That woman was finally infuriated by Chu Feng. As she spoke, she waved her sleeve and immediately caused the sky to darken. A violent wind swept forth. Blowing up the sand on the ground, a powerful wind swept toward Chu Feng.

After the wind blew past Chu Feng, the surroundings had all changed somewhat. Only Chu Feng remained completely untainted by a speck of dust.

“You!!!”

Seeing that her attack was actually incapable of injuring Chu Feng, that woman’s expression immediately turned sluggish. Deep shock filled her beautiful eyes.

“You dare to anger my lil sis, you are truly seeking punishment!”

Right at that moment, another Dongguo Heavenly Clansman unleashed an attack at Chu Feng. That person was a rank five Heavenly Immortal.

His attack did not cause much of a scene like that woman’s attack. However, his oppressive might was no small matter.

Unfortunately, even though his oppressive might had clearly enveloped Chu Feng, Chu Feng acted as if he were completely fine.

Chu Feng continued to stand on his feet, and showed no sign of being affected by the oppressive might.

“This...”

At that moment, the shock on the faces of the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen grew even stronger. They were even feeling a bit at a loss.

They all turned their eyes to the strongest person among them, that rank seven Heavenly Immortal.

“No wonder you have the courage to come to our Dongguo Heavenly Clan. It would appear that a person with backbone has arrived from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Since that’s the case, allow me to experience your strength. If you are able to pass my trial, I will bring you inside our Dongguo Heavenly Clan’s city.”

As that rank seven Heavenly Immortal spoke, he began to walk toward Chu Feng.

Not only did his clothes and long hair begin to flutter in the air, but his powerful aura also swept through the sky.

At that moment, a lot of people were gathered on the city walls. Their attention was captured by what was happening.

“Break~~~”

Suddenly, that man raised his hand and sent forth a palm strike at Chu Feng.

Immediately, a boundless wind formed an visible giant hand that moved toward Chu Feng to oppress him.

At that moment, both the ground and the surrounding space began to tremble.

However, after such a powerful attack passed over Chu Feng, he remained completely unharmed.

“This guy!!!”

At that moment, including the five Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen outside, even the crowd on the city walls revealed expressions of disbelief.

In their impression, Chu Hongyi was the strongest member of the Chu Heavenly Clan present in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Because of that, they had felt that the so-called geniuses of the Chu Heavenly Clan that were training in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm were merely a bunch of trash.

However, Chu Feng had caused them to be completely taken aback. He made them have no choice but to change their opinion of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.
