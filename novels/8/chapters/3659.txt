Chapter 3659 - Unfair Advantage?

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Lord Shoujian waved his sleeve. The energy ripples wreaking havoc throughout the sky were immediately dispersed.

At that moment, the crowd were able to see that Chu Feng was still standing where he was.

As for Nangong Yifan, he was only several dozen meters away from him.

However, Chu Feng’s clothes were completely undamaged. Nangong Yifan, on the other hand, was lying on the ground.

Furthermore, Nangong Yifan’s state of health was extremely weak. He did not even have the strength to stand.

What he was suffering from was most definitely not superficial wounds. Even his soul had been injured.

“He won! Chu Feng won!”

“Chu Feng actually really managed to defeat a rank nine Immortal Technique using an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill?”

“Unbelievable, this is simply unbelievable!”

After a moment of tranquility, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations burst into an uproar of excitement.

If the confrontation between Chu Feng and Nangong Yifan at the beginning had still resembled a spar, then the confrontation afterwards was an actual showdown.

This was even more so when Nangong Yifan had clearly lost his ability to continue fighting.

Chu Feng had thoroughly won the battle.

However, while the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were all jubilant and celebrating, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations had stern looks on their faces.

“Yifan.”

At that moment, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations all arrived before Nangong Yifan and helped him up. They began to feed him medicinal pellets and treat his injuries.

That said, there were also a lot of people that were looking at Chu Feng with sharp, knife-like gazes.

“Chu Feng, it was merely a spar, why must you be so vicious?”

“Do you not understand what it means by ‘stop when the outcome is determined?’”

Beiyang Luo and the others looked to Chu Feng furiously.

“Are you all blind or what? I’ve only destroyed his rank nine Immortal Technique and left some superficial wounds on his body. I didn’t harm his soul at all.”

“The reason for his current condition is due to the backlash from the forbidden medicine he took. It has nothing to do with me,” said Chu Feng.

“What young friend Chu Feng says is correct. For the sake of fairness, this old man has been focused on the battle the entire time. If young friend Chu Feng truly wanted to cause vicious harm, this old man would’ve acted to stop him.”

“Young friend Nangong Yifan’s current state of injury is indeed mostly unrelated to young friend Chu Feng,” said lord Shoujian.

“You all from the All-heaven Starfield, are you planning to act like sore losers? Even we can tell that Nangong Yifan’s injuries are caused by the backlash from the forbidden medicine, how could you not be able to?”

“Humph. Is everyone from the All-heaven Starfield like this?”

“Not only did you use forbidden medicine, but you’re even blaming others for the backlash of your forbidden medicine. I’ve truly never met people as shameless as you.”

“That’s right. When you defeated us in the chess matches, we never used any excuses.”

“How come when it’s your turn to lose this time around, you have so many excuses? You’re all truly sore losers, truly shameless.”

With Kong Tianhui and Wuming Yuanzhi leading the charge, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations began to ridicule the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations.

“Humph. Shameless?”

“If anyone is shameless, it’ll be you all.”

“You clearly know that Chu Feng only had his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor to increase his cultivation. If he had fought Yifan from the start, he would simply be no match for him.”

“That is why you deliberately planned and sent forth Wuming Yuanzhi and the others to stop Nangong Yifan, forcing him to use his Scarletflame Soularmor.”

“Chu Feng only stood forth after the power of the Scarletflame Soularmor could not be used anymore.”

“Chu Feng, ask yourself this, did you really win?”

“Do you have the shame to blame Yifan for using forbidden medicine?”

“That’s right. While it is true that Yifan used forbidden medicine, no matter how powerful the forbidden medicine might be, could it possibly grant him a level of cultivation?”

“So what if your abilities are very powerful? Yifan is capable of increasing his cultivation by three successive levels, whereas you’re only able to increase yours by two.”

“Ask yourself this, if Yifan could use the power of the Scarletflame Soularmor, if he could increase his cultivation by another level, could you possibly defeat him?”

“Chu Feng, you are simply despicable and shameless in giving yourself an unfair advantage.”

Beiyang Luo and the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations all began to lash out at Chu Feng.

They simply refused to admit that Nangong Yifan had been defeated. Instead, they felt that Chu Feng had won through despicable means.

“The Scarletflame Soularmor is a treasure. My brother Chu Feng’s Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor are both powers belonging to his bloodline. Those are true abilities.”

“Compared to using one’s own bloodline’s power, what is there to be proud of in using treasures to increase one’s cultivation?” Kong Tianhui spoke with a look of contempt.

“Humph. So what if it’s a treasure? It is one’s capability to be able to use a treasure. Otherwise, how come your younger sister has a treasure to increase her cultivation, whereas you do not? Is it because your Divine Body Royal City does not possess that sort of powerful treasure, or is it because you’re simply unable to subdue it?” Beiyang Luo mocked.

Kong Tianhui was naturally not going to be outdone. He immediately refuted him.

Soon, the Ancestral Martial Starfield and the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were all arguing.

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were insisting that Chu Feng won with an unfair advantage, while the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were calling them sore losers.

Even though none of them were backing down from their quarrel, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations, including the loudest and fiercest Kong Tianhui and Wuming Yuanzhi, were actually panicking.

They all felt what Beiyang Luo said to be very reasonable.

It was true that Chu Feng had gained dominance while having an equal cultivation, with Nangong Yifan taking a forbidden medicine. If Nangong Yifan hadn’t take that forbidden medicine, he would likely be absolutely no match for Chu Feng at all.

However, it was also true that Nangong Yifan was unable to use the power of his Scarletflame Soularmor.

If he was able to use his Scarletflame Soularmor, his cultivation would be a level above Chu Feng’s. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The disparity in cultivation was something that could not be made up for. No matter how strong Chu Feng’s battle power might be, no matter how astonishing his abilities might be, he would not be able to come out victorious.

Because of that, they were worried that when Nangong Yifan’s backlash ended and his Scarletflame Soularmor was able to be used again, if Nangong Yifan decided to challenge Chu Feng again, the one that would be defeated would likely be Chu Feng.

Even though Chu Feng still had his world spirit, it remained that it would be his world spirit’s and not his actual cultivation, his actual battle power, something that martial cultivators acknowledged more.

Because of that, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s crowd were worried for Chu Feng.

While it was true that he had won, Nangong Yifan could challenge him again at any time.

How was Chu Feng supposed to deal with Nangong Yifan when that happened?

“Actually, I’d already anticipated you all would say that.”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s voice was heard.

The crowd discovered that Chu Feng did not have any trace of anger on his face even after being criticized and insulted by the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations. On the contrary, he was smiling faintly.

It was as if the insults and criticisms from the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were very hilarious for him.

“Chu Feng, did you finally realize that you had an unfair advantage in the battle?” Beiyang Luo mocked.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng laughed lightly. Then, he said, “Look carefully. Do I, Chu Feng, really have an unfair advantage?”

“Huu~~~”

Right after Chu Feng’s words left his mouth, a powerful aura swept out from his body.

As Beiyang Luo and the others were standing rather close to Chu Feng, they were blown to the ground.

Chu Feng’s outward appearance did not change. Apart from the Lightning Armor and Lightning Mark, no other power appeared. However... Chu Feng’s cultivation had increased from rank four Exalted to rank five Exalted.
