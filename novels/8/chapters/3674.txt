Chapter 3674 - Dangerous Circumstances

“Brother Chu Feng, the dead cannot be brought back to life. You should restrain your grief and accept fate.”

Seeing the sudden pained look on Chu Feng’s face, Kong Tianhui, who did not know what was actually going on, thought that Chu Feng was feeling sad because of Chu Xuanyuan’s death. Thus, Kong Tianhui immediately went up to Chu Feng to comfort him.

“Big brother Chu Feng, don’t feel too sad. If uncle Chu Xuanyuan were still alive, he would not want to see you like this.”

“Chu Feng, you must be strong.”

Long Ning and Kong Ci also stepped forward to comfort Chu Feng.

Being comforted like that, Chu Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The reason why he revealed such a pained look on his face was because he felt that he had let down his father.

However, the people around him thought that he was feeling sad because of his father’s death.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng could not tell them that his father was still alive.

“Senior, senior Chu Xuanyuan has been fine all this time, why would he suddenly pass away?” Xian Yun asked the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

Xian Yun’s question was right on the mark. At that moment, everyone turned their gazes to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master. They also wanted to know why Chu Xuanyuan would suddenly die.

“I’ve heard that it was related to his training. It seemed like he had lost control whilst training, and ended up causing this misfortune,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“So that was the case.”

“This...”

Hearing those words, the people of the younger generation felt even greater grief. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even though none of them had met Chu Xuanyuan before, he was simply too famous in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. The people of the older generation that had encountered him would all praise him highly.

Because of that, even though those people of the younger generation felt utter contempt for the Chu Heavenly Clan, they were extremely respectful towards Chu Xuanyuan.

In fact, many of the people of the younger generation considered Chu Xuanyuan to be their idol.

That was the reason why they felt grief upon learning of his passing.

‘Lost control whilst training?’

‘Say, father, you have quite the trick.’

Compared to the others, Chu Feng felt even greater admiration for his father.

Before Chu Feng had learned of the news of his father’s death, Ancestral Martial Dragon City had already learned of it. Furthermore, judging from the behavior of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master, it seemed like a lot of people had already learned of the news of his father’s death.

This meant that, apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan, there had been people secretly observing the place where his father was imprisoned the entire time.

Likely, those people had already discovered the powerful spirit formation his father had set up.

Likely, apart from Chu Feng, no one else would be able to breach that spirit formation.

Likely, those people had determined from how powerful that spirit formation was that Chu Xuanyuan’s strength had not declined, but instead increased.

That was likely the reason why they were so afraid of him.

That said, why would there suddenly be a sealing formation around the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area? That was a question worth pondering.

Now that his father Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape had ‘died’ through a training accident, it would serve as an extremely good explanation for everything.

The sealing formation was set up so that Chu Feng’s father Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape could enter closed-door training. Unfortunately, they encountered an accident while training, and ended up suffering from the misfortune of death. With that, the sealing formation had faded by itself.

Everything would make sense.

“Chu Feng, I know that you’re feeling very sad. Actually, all of us are very sad after learning of this matter.”

“However, this is no time to imprison yourself in grief.”

“You need to know that the current situation is not only very dangerous for you, but it is also very dangerous for your Chu Heavenly Clan. If you are willing, my Ancestral Martial Dragon City can shelter your Chu Heavenly Clan,” the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master said to Chu Feng.

“Senior, are you serious about that?” Chu Feng was overjoyed upon hearing those words.

“As our Three Cities do not involve ourselves in the matters of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, we cannot dispatch people to protect your Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“However, if your Chu Heavenly Clan is willing to come to our Ancestral Martial Dragon City, no one can voice any complaint.” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Thank you, senior, for your kind intentions,” Although Chu Feng appeared to be rather composed, he was actually feeling extremely excited.

With Chu Feng’s current abilities, he would be able to protect himself. Thus, he was not worried about himself.

What he was worried about was the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After all, Chu Feng still did not have the ability to protect the Chu Heavenly Clan.

If Ancestral Martial Dragon City was willing to protect the Chu Heavenly Clan, things could not be more wonderful.

After all, the Ancestral Martial Starfield was engulfed in a war between the Linghu Heavenly Clan and the Starfield Master Realm. Things were destined to become extremely chaotic.

The Three Cities could be said to be the only places that would be unaffected by the war.

“Young friend Chu Feng, if your clansmen are willing, you can bring them to my Ancestral Martial Dragon City,” As the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master spoke, he handed a title plate to Chu Feng.

It was an invitation title plate from Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

“This matter is of great significance. This junior is unable to make this decision on his own. I will have to return to my clan and discuss it with my Lord Clan Chief.”

“That said, I must still thank you Lord Clan Chief for your kindness.”

Chu Feng accepted the title plate and bowed respectfully to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“You don’t have to thank me. Young friend Chu Feng, you should quickly return to your clan. Otherwise, if news of your father’s death is to spread, your Chu Heavenly Clan will be in great danger,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Thank you for your reminder, senior.”

Indeed, the current situation was very bad. After expressing his thanks, Chu Feng immediately left, and began to proceed for the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After Chu Feng left, the people of the younger generation all returned to the Divine Armament Villa.

Xian Yuying, Kong Shanwu and Long Daozhi, the three City Masters, did not continue to stay in the Divine Armament Villa. They also did not return to their respective territories.

Instead, the three of them were actually secretly following Chu Feng.

Actually, ever since Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui arrived at the Divine Armament Villa, the three of them had been secretly monitoring Chu Feng.

Apart from the times when Chu Feng entered places that they could not enter, his every movement was within their field of vision.

Due to the great disparity in strength, even though Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he did not detect their monitoring at all.

En route, the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master asked curiously, “City Master Long, say, do you think that Chu Xuanyuan has truly died? How come I keep feeling that this matter is fishy?” Skepticism filled her lovely, charming eyes.

“Regardless of whether it’s real or not, as it is a matter concerning the deceased, it is better that we stop making guesses,” the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master said.

“What brother Kong says is correct,” the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master said.

“If you put it that way,” The Monstrous Holy City’s City Master smiled charmingly. Then, she said, “In that case, who do you think will win the war between the Linghu Heavenly Clan and the Starfield Master Realm?”
