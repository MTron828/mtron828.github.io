Chapter 5209: The Final Treasure

“Eighth brother, hurry up and get rid of that Demon Spirit King! I’m going to kill those two nameless juniors!”

Daoist Ninth Dragon was enraged by Tao Wu’s attitude. He took out three pills with light glowing on their surfaces. These pills harnessed incredibly powerful but highly violent spirit power.

Despite that, Daoist Ninth Dragon still swallowed all three pills at once.

Boom!

Spirit power immediately began flooding from Daoist Ninth Dragon’s body.

“Ninth brother, you…”

Daoist Eighth Dragon looked conflicted upon seeing that. He knew that while those pills did temporarily raise one’s fighting prowess, they came with terrifying side effects. Otherwise, he would have long consumed those pills himself to defeat the Demon Spirit King.

The increased spirit power allowed Daoist Ninth Dragon to channel his formation with greater ferocity, thus further amplifying Daoist Eighth Dragon’s strength. Unfortunately, it still wasn’t enough for them to quickly defeat the Demon Spirit King.

If they wanted to end this battle quickly, Daoist Eighth Dragon would have to consume the pill too.

“Forget it. Let’s end this battle as soon as possible.”

Knowing that this was what Daoist Ninth Dragon wanted, Daoist Eighth Dragon took out three pills and swallowed them too.

“Such minor tricks. Do you think that you’re the only one who has forbidden medicine? Even at the cost of my life, I’ll drag you two despicable scums down to hell with me!”

Daoist Eighth Dragon’s movements didn’t escape the Demon Spirit King’s notice. He quickly consumed five sinister-looking pills that were emanating a black aura with a flick of his wrist.

As both of their fighting prowess raised at practically the same moment, Daoist Eighth Dragon failed to claim a decisive advantage over the Demon Spirit King.

In fact, the Demon Spirit King enjoyed a greater rise in fighting prowess, and he exploited this opportunity to go on the offensive. This put both Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon in a highly disadvantageous position.

“Demon Spirit King, are you out of your mind?!” Daoist Eighth Dragon shouted while trying to fend against the Demon Spirit King’s ferocious attacks.

Given that the Demon Spirit King had enjoyed a greater increment in strength from his forbidden medicine, the chances were that he would suffer a greater backlash too. There was a good chance that it might cost him his life.

“What a joke. The one who loses here in this battle is bound to die anyway. What’s the point of saying all that?”

The Demon Spirit King laughed heartily. His fighting spirit was clearly greater than the two daoists.

“You’re a lunatic!”

Daoist Eighth Dragon shot a glance at Daoist Ninth Dragon, and the latter quickly took out a formation. However, this formation clearly wasn’t constructed by either of them, for it was extremely powerful. It was to the extent where even a world spiritist of Daoist Ninth Dragon’s caliber would have to overexert himself just to activate the formation.

Nevertheless, he still did it without any hesitation.

Weng!

As soon as the formation was activated, the power of teleportation shrouded both Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon. At the same time, a massive burst of light pushed the Demon Spirit King away.

By the time the light faded, the two daoists were already nowhere to be seen.

“You’re trying to escape? Dream on!”

The Demon Spirit King turned toward the entrance of the cavern and focused his senses. He could sense both Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon simultaneously appearing at the entrance of the pit, so he immediately rushed over to chase them.

Unfortunately, he still was a step too late. The two daoists had already gotten away by the time he arrived.

“Damn it!”

The Demon Spirit King left the cavern and returned to the bottom of the pit, where the three spirit formation gates were. He stared intently at the spirit formation gate where only world spirits could enter and murmured, “Xue Ji, you must return safely.”

He took out a huge bundle of pills and swallowed them down. All of these pills served to suppress the side effect of the forbidden medicine.

However, judging from his reaction, it seemed like his actions were futile. The forbidden medicine he had eaten was simply too potent.

He was intending to die together with Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon, but those two managed to give him the slip. Knowing that it was futile to idle here, he decided to rush out of the pit and continue pursuing the two daoists.

…

Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Tao Wu found themselves entering a massive hall. It had a ceiling that was over a hundred thousand meters tall, and its length and width were only larger than that. Had the two of them been ordinary mortals, it would have taken a long time for them to walk from one end of the hall to the other.

As large as the hall was, it was also empty.

The walls on the right side of the hall were made out of huge transparent glass panels. Through it, one could see an adjacent hall that was identical to the one they were in, with the key difference being that the entrance was not a physical gate but a spirit formation gate.

Chu Feng noticed that the spirit formation gate in the adjacent hall resembled the one Eggy and the others had passed through earlier. This made him think that Eggy and the others were going to appear in the adjacent hall.

Other than that, there was something else in the hall Chu Feng and Tao Wu were in that couldn’t be found in the adjacent hall—the Godsoul. It was located at the end of the hall.

The Godsoul was humongous, spanning over a hundred thousand meters in length, but Chu Feng didn’t think that it was its true size. The Godsoul was actually placed inside a formation, and Chu Feng believed that it would be even larger one taken out of the formation.

An object that was over a hundred thousand meters in length was already humongous by Chu Feng’s standards. It would have been a truly magnificent sight if the Godsoul appeared in its full glory.

“Elder Tao Wu, is that the real Godsoul?” Chu Feng asked.

“It should be. It’s the ultimate treasure, after all. There’s no reason for a fake one to be placed here,” Tao Wu replied.

“How do we breach the formation? There isn’t any hints at all.”

Chu Feng wanted to obtain the Godsoul, but he couldn’t access it due to the formation around it. He sensed that the formation wasn’t just a simple protective formation, which put him at a loss as to how he should deal with it.

“I’ve also been pondering upon this question,” Tao Wu replied with a frown.

“Can the formation only be breached after our world spirits enter the adjacent hall?” Chu Feng asked.

“That could be the case,” Tao Wu replied.

Weng!

All of a sudden, the spirit formation gate in the adjacent hall started whirring. A world spirit was entering the space.

Chu Feng and Tao Wu immediately turned their sights over, praying hard for it to be their own world spirit. Under their intense gaze, a figure walked in.

To their dismay, it was neither Tao Wu nor Chu Feng’s world spirit.

Xue Ji.

“Xue Ji? Isn’t she without a master? How is she able to enter that hall?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Chu Feng was confused.

What perplexed him even further was how Xue Ji began scanning her surroundings with a confused look on her face. She didn’t seem to have noticed Chu Feng and Tao Wu.

“It looks like the glass panels are one-way. We can see those in the adjacent hall, but those in the adjacent hall aren’t able to see us,” Chu Feng said.

“That should be the case. I doubt that she’s just ignoring us here,” Tao Wu agreed with him.

Weng!

Two light halos made out of spirit power suddenly manifested around the Godsoul. These light halos appeared to be of the same origin as the formation sealing off the Godsoul.

“It’s here.”

Chu Feng and Tao Wu understood that whether they were able to breach the formation and obtain the Godsoul depended on those two light halos.
