Chapter 3664 - The Dangerous Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda

“Truth be told, this junior is indeed very interested. I’ve heard that the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda has weapons that world spirits can use. My world spirit currently does not possess such a weapon,” said Chu Feng.

Lord Shoujian sighed. “Young friend Chu Feng, it isn’t that this old man is forbidding you to enter it, it’s simply that the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda is too dangerous.”

“Dangerous?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

“Originally, that Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda was a place where our Divine Armament Villa kept our weapons.”

“Later on, during our Divine Armament Villa’s third Villa Master’s time, he had a friend that came to our Divine Armament Villa.”

“Originally, our Villa Master’s friend had accidently discovered an Ancient Era’s remnant. He obtained treasures left behind by a master world spiritist of the Ancient Era from that remnant.”

“Those treasures were weapons especially created for world spirits using special materials and special methods.”

“Every weapon was created using both materials from our martial cultivation world and the seven spirit worlds. Reportedly, world spirits were capable of unleashing great power should they use those weapons in the martial cultivation world.”

“Normally, all of those weapons would be priceless treasures.”

“However, it just so happened that our Villa Master’s friend was not an avaricious individual. He arrived at our Divine Armament Villa and, after discussing with our Villa Master, made the decision to put all those weapons into our Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda. Furthermore, he left a very powerful spirit formation around the pagoda.”

“He stated that, regardless of who it might be, if anyone was able to breach the spirit formation he set up and enter the pagoda, they would be able to choose from the weapons inside at will.”

“Unfortunately, after so many years have passed, there has not been anyone capable of breaching that spirit formation. No one has been able to enter the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.”

“Not even the people from our Divine Armament Villa were able to enter it.”

“It would be one thing if being unable to breach the spirit formation was all there was to it. However, that Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda actually possesses a grand slaughtering formation.”

“Should one approach the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda, they will immediately be attacked by that slaughtering formation. As that slaughtering formation is extremely powerful, one will either be killed or injured should one approach it. Not to mention the outsiders, even our Divine Armament Villa suffered a lot of casualties through that slaughtering formation.”

“Later on, the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda was deemed a forbidden area, and no one was allowed to approach it anymore,” said Lord Shoujian.

“There’s such a thing?” Hearing those things, Chu Feng realized why Lord Shoujian was against allowing him to enter the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda. It turned out, the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda was a very dangerous place.

“Chu Feng, Lord Shoujian is not lying to you. That place is truly very dangerous. A senior from our Divine Body Royal City attempted to breach that spirit formation before.”

“In the end, not only did he fail to breach it, but he even nearly lost his cultivation in the process. It took over a thousand years to nurse him back to health. However, even now, he still hasn’t managed to regain the cultivation he had back then.”

“You need to know that that senior of mine was a peak Exalted expert. He was someone who was originally capable of becoming an Utmost Exalted.”

“It’s all due to that damned pagoda that he ended up ruining his future prospects.”

Kong Ci walked over and warned Chu Feng about the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda. Furthermore, she was complaining as she mentioned what had happened to her senior.

“When even a peak Exalted is unable to breach the spirit formation. would it not mean that the Villa Master’s friend was an extraordinary individual?” asked Chu Feng.

“Actually, our Villa Master only met that friend of his through a chance encounter. He doesn’t even know the name of that person. That said, that person did indeed possess unfathomable strength.”

“Speaking of it, that person was a very strange expert,” said Lord Shoujian.

Right at that moment, Yin Zhuanghong suddenly stood up and spoke. “Senior, as long as you are willing to allow Chu Feng and I to attempt to enter the pagoda, I am willing to accept all conditions.”

Hearing her words, the crowd came to a sudden realization.

What Yin Zhuanghong had talked to Chu Feng in private about earlier was mostly likely regarding this.

Otherwise, Chu Feng would not have suddenly brought it up, and Yin Zhuanghong would not be so interested in it.

“Miss Yin, if the two of you insist on entering the pagoda, this old man will not stop you. That said, this old man truly does not wish for the two of you to brave such risks.”

“With your talent, your future prospects are inestimable. There is no need to take on such risks for weapons for world spirits, no?” said Lord Shoujian.

“According to what senior has said, does it mean that senior will not stop me if I decided to proceed for the pagoda?” asked Yin Zhuanghong.

“I will not,” Lord Shoujian shook his head.

“Chu Feng, I’m going. What about you?” Yin Zhuanghong turned her gaze to Chu Feng.

“I’m going too,” said Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, have you gone mad?”

“All those miserable precedents are present before you, why do you still insist on taking such risks?”

“Chu Feng, if you want weapons for your world spirit, we can think of other methods to find one for you. There is simply no need to insist on challenging the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda. That is truly not a place that people should enter.”

“That’s right. It’s one thing if you decide to brave risks because there’s cultivation treasures in there. However... the things in there are merely weapons for world spirits.”

Kong Tianhui and Kong Ci immediately ran over to dissuade Chu Feng.

“Whilst there are a lot of weapons that world spirits can use, the weapons outside cannot compare to the ones contained in the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda,” said Yin Zhuanghong.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng grew even more tempted.

“Senior, I hope for your understanding.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng bowed respectfully to Lord Shoujian. He was expressing his intention of earnestly wanting to proceed for the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.

Lord Shoujian let out a sigh. Then, he said, “Since that’s the case, this old man can only hope that the two of you will be able to accomplish what’s impossible for others, and successfully enter the Heaven-reaching Armory pagoda.”

“Thank you for agreeing to it, senior,” Chu Feng clasped his fist to express his thanks.

Even though practically no one wished for Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong to brave such a risk, no one was able to stop the two of them with how determined they were.

Later on, Lord Shoujian brought Chu Feng and the others and arrived at that Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.

Lord Shoujian did not lie. That place had indeed been deemed a forbidden area. It was protected by a very powerful sealing formation.

That sealing formation was not simply a world spirit technique. Instead, it contained the power of treasures. Thus, even for a Saint-cloak World Spiritist like Chu Feng, he would have to spend quite some time if he wanted to breach it.

Thus, without a special spirit formation key, it would be very difficult for one to enter the area.

At that moment, Lord Shoujian had already opened the spirit formation entrance using a spirit formation key.

“Young friend Chu Feng, miss Yin, look carefully. There are still skeletons under that pagoda. It is still not too late to change your mind,” Lord Shoujian pointed to the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.

Chu Feng was able to see that there were indeed a lot of skeletons under the pagoda. Some of those skeletons were sliced into pieces, some were charred black and some showed signs of being struck by lightning.

It could be seen that those people had suffered quite a lot before their deaths. Most importantly, there were quite a few skeletons.

Sure enough, Lord Shoujian had not lied to them. The Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda was indeed very dangerous. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Furthermore, a lot of people had already lost their lives to it.

“As long as you do as I say, I guarantee that you will be able to enter it,” Yin Zhuanghong said to Chu Feng.

She was extremely confident as she said those words. Chu Feng could tell that she was not joking around. Besides, she was not someone fond of jokes.

Thus, she most definitely knew of a method to enter the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.
