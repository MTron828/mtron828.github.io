Chu Feng’s mind was groggy. He couldn’t hear or remember anything; there was only one thing salient to him—pain.

It was the punishment he had to take for pushing himself beyond his limit.

Without Wen Xue’s help, ordinary recovery methods did little to help him. This punishment also lasted for a long time as if to remind him of the grievous sin he had committed, so that he would think twice before committing it again.

When Chu Feng was finally able to open his eyes once more, he saw a familiar face and heard a familiar voice.

“Big brother Chu Feng, how are you feeling?”

Zi Ling’s beautiful face not only reflected her worry but her frailty too. Even so, the corners of her lips curled into a beautiful smile when she confirmed that Chu Feng was awake, which lit up her frail face.

This was the magic of romance. It could make a person frail, but it could also energize a person. However, Chu Feng still felt conscience-ridden for making Zi Ling go through such a difficult time.

“I’m fine. I’m sorry to have worried you.” Chu Feng pushed himself up despite being in a weakened state; he wanted to make himself look fine to allay Zi Ling’s worry.

“How can I not be worried? But I don’t blame you for this. I’ll unconditionally support you no matter what you do,” Zi Ling said with a sweet smile.

“I know.” Chu Feng gently touched Zi Ling’s cheeks. This was just the kind of person she was, which only made him feel even more apologetic to her.

“How was it?” Zi Ling asked.

They only knew that Chu Feng had challenged the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, but they didn’t know the outcome. Chu Feng told Zi Ling everything that had happened.

Similarly, Zi Ling also told him how the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and Wen Xue were faring. Wen Xue had paid a hefty price to treat him, so she would need some time to make a full recovery. The sectmaster was doing slightly better, but not by much.

Chu Feng’s allies had paid a heavy price to help him deal with Jie Tianran.

As for Jie Tianran, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect could see his every movement despite the many layers of formation he had constructed around the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, so they could tell that he hadn’t returned since Chu Feng passed out.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elders continued examining the gates of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, but they were unable to make any progress without the aid of a supporting means.

“It looks like there’s a limit to Jie Tianran’s recovery means as well, but that’s to be expected.” Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief.

He had reached his limit in his second clash with Jie Tianran. He would be helpless if Jie Tianran made a swift recovery and attempted to enter the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city again.

“Zi Ling, how long was I out for?” Chu Feng asked.

“A month,” Zi Ling replied.

“That’s fine.” It was shorter than Chu Feng had expected. “Where’s Lord Sectmaster? Is it convenient for me to meet her?”

“Master told me to bring you to her once you’re feeling better. Big brother Chu Feng, are you all right? Are you sure you don’t have to rest a bit longer?” Zi Ling was still worried.

“I’m fine. Now that I have awakened, it’s only a matter of time before I make a full recovery. Rather, I’m more worried about you.” Chu Feng reached out and grabbed Zi Ling’s wrist to diagnose her condition.

The latter hadn’t recovered from forcefully breaking out of her closed-door cultivation yet.

“Don’t worry about me. Just like you, I just need time to recover,” Zi Ling replied with a smile.

However, Chu Feng frowned. His condition might be terrible at the moment, but he would swiftly recover once he awakened. On the other hand, Zi Ling appeared to be in a better condition, but her foundation had received severe damage.

Chu Feng had treasures that could heal one’s foundation and cultivation, but the stronger one’s foundation was, the harder it was to mend it. On top of that, Zi Ling’s case was special. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do at the moment to help Zi Ling’s injuries.

“That’s good to hear.”

Chu Feng didn’t blame Zi Ling for breaking out of her closed-door cultivation. It was done and over; there was no point blaming her now. Just like how Zi Ling unconditionally supported his decisions, it was the same for Chu Feng too.

There had to be a way to repair her foundation, though it wouldn’t be easy.

Chu Feng thought that Wen Xue might be able to help her since Wen Xue directly healed others through her life force. Theoretically speaking, her means should work on most conditions. The only problem was the price Wen Xue had to pay for it.

“Let’s meet Lord Sectmaster.” Chu Feng stood up.

Shortly after, Chu Feng met the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. He did have an inkling as to what kind of state she would be in, but he still felt guilt-ridden when he saw her condition.

“Lord Sectmaster, I...”

Chu Feng was halfway through his words when the sectmaster interjected. “If you’re going to say something soppy, spare it. Tell me what’s the situation with the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect instead.”

The sectmaster’s face was so emaciated that she looked hideous, but her smile was still as benevolent as ever. Chu Feng smiled in response.

He told her what he had encountered in the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect, but he didn’t just stop there.

Since Zi Ling was present here too, he told them what he had gone through ever since leaving the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, such as his meeting with Long Chengyu and the others, venturing into the Immemorial Star Sea, his conflict with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, the events that transpired in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, and so on.

The sectmaster nodded in approval. She felt that Chu Feng’s deeds had brought honor to their Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

“Chu Feng, our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s ancestor, who resides in True Essence Mountain, told me to hand this to you. She played a critical role in protecting our Ancestral Martial Galaxy. You should remember her, right?” the sectmaster said as she passed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

“Of course,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

As soon as he received the Cosmos Sack, a formation surfaced. This was a formation that only Chu Feng could decipher. He quickly deciphered the formation, and a message flowed into his head.

Through the message, he learned that the ancestor residing in the True Essence Mountain was the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s guild leader. It finally dawned on him why the guild leader helped him even though they had never met before.

It turned out that they were from the same sect.

The other party told Chu Feng to keep this matter a secret. She didn’t want the sectmaster and the others to know about her other identity.

Aside from that, she also gave Chu Feng an address. She would be going into seclusion there, and Chu Feng could look for her there if he needed her help.

“The world of cultivation thinks that our Ancestral Martial Galaxy is a pushover, but little do they know that we have many experts hidden in our midst,” Chu Feng remarked.

“Of course.” The sectmaster nodded in agreement.

She didn’t know their ancestor was the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s guild leader, but she knew that their ancestor was a Heavenly God level cultivator who possessed the means to deal with the Ancient Era’s clan leaders.

“Chu Feng, you should stay in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for the time being if you have nothing up,” the sectmaster said.

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had infiltrated the Ancestral Martial Galaxy and were constructing formations everywhere under the pretext of protecting them, but they clearly had other motives in mind.

Considering the enmity between Chu Feng and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, he would be in a safer position if he remained in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

However, Chu Feng shook his head.

In truth, he would have returned even if not for the Ancient Era’s clans attacking the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.
