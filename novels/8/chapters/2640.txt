Chapter 2640 - Golden Forbidden Medicine

Wang Qiang did not chase after the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster who had turned around to escape. Instead, he burst into loud laughter.

Mockingly, Wang Qiang said, “S-Sure enough, you’re t-trash. Even if you possess an In-Inc-Incomplete Immortal Arm-Armament, y-you r-remain t-trash still.”

“Say, t-trash g-grandson, how a-are you s-supposed to kill your g-granddaddy like this? Wouldn’t w-what you de-declared earlier be n-nothing more t-than a pipe d-dream?”

“H-How a-about your g-granddaddy g-give you a h-handicap, and u-use o-only one hand?”

“H-How about this. Y-Your g-granddaddy will give you a massive handicap of b-both hands and legs.”

“Your granddaddy m-might a-as well not fight back. I-I’ll just stand here and l-let you cut m-me down.”

“Damned stutterer! Shut up!”

Finally, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster spoke. He was filled with rage, Flames were shooting out from his eyes.

Not to mention the rage on his face, all of his veins in his entire body were bulging forth.

In fact, he was already shivering in anger.

The reason for that was because he discovered that he was truly unable to match the Wang Qiang before him.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s heart suddenly grew tense. He discovered that items had appeared in his palm.

“Swallow them.”

Then, a voice transmission entered the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s ears.

It was the voice of that Chu Heavenly Clan’s old man.

When that voice was heard, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was immediately overjoyed. He immediately looked to his palm.

That old man possessed overwhelming power. If he were to help him, then regardless of how powerful Wang Qiang might be, Wang Qiang would still be defeated by him.

“These are...”

When the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster looked to his palm, he immediately revealed a stunned expression.

There were tens of medicinal pellets in his palm.

Those medicinal pellets were not very large. They were each only one tenth the size of an ordinary pearl.

Those medicinal pellets were golden, and were emitting bright golden light and extraordinary auras.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was able to tell with a single glance that they were forbidden medicines. Furthermore, they were an extremely powerful sort of forbidden medicine.

“Swallow them,” Right at that moment, that old man’s voice sounded again.

However, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster did not do as he indicated. He knew very well that he would definitely die should he swallow all of the forbidden medicine.

“Swallow those medicinal pellets and this old man will guarantee that you will live.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“If you are to refuse to swallow them, even this old man will not be able to save you,” that old man’s voice sounded again.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster actually knew very well what sort of situation he was in. Due to his identity, even if that old man possessed overwhelming power, he would not be able to act to help him.

If he wanted to defeat Wang Qiang and the others, he could only rely on himself. If he were to swallow those medicinal pellets, he would be able to defeat Wang Qiang.

If he did not swallow the medicinal pellets, he would only be killed by Wang Qiang.

Judging from that, swallowing the forbidden medicines would be the most optimal choice for now.

However, even though he knew that was the case, he still did not dare to swallow the forbidden medicine.

The reason for that was because he knew that swallowing those forbidden medicines would be equivalent to taking one foot and placing it over the gates of hell. He would have no way to go back on his decision.

“What’s t-this? You’re u-unable to d-defeat your g-granddaddy, and plan t-to use forbidden medicines now?”

“Say, my d-dear grandson, look at y-yourself. Y-You a-are t-truly a d-d-d-disappointment to your g-granddaddy.”

“Forget a-about i-it-it. Go ahead and t-take them. Your granddaddy shall see w-what tricks you have l-left,” Wang Qiang mocked.

Although Wang Qiang was able to tell that those were forbidden medicines, he did not stop the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

The reason for that was because Wang Qiang simply did not place those forbidden medicines in his eyes.

He felt that even if the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster were to take those forbidden medicines, he would still not be able to defeat him.

The reason for that was because Wang Qiang was able to sense exactly how powerful his battle power was. It was precisely because he knew how powerful he was that he acted so confidently.

“Take t-them. Your g-granddaddy is telling you to take them. W-Why are you s-still lingering around?”

“Grandson, take them right n-now. S-Swallow them and c-come fight a-against your granddaddy again.”

Seeing that the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was hesitant to take the forbidden medicines, Wang Qiang started to laugh mockingly.

“Damned stutterer! Shut the fuck up!”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster shouted furiously.

Then, he raised his hand and directly tossed the handful of golden forbidden medicines into his mouth.

He was truly and utterly enraged by Wang Qiang. It was precisely because of the fury he felt toward Wang Qiang that he gained the courage to take those forbidden medicines.

After all, those forbidden medicines would be able to help him teach Wang Qiang a proper and ruthless lesson. They would be able to help him vent the anger in his heart.

“Bang~~~”

Right after those forbidden medicine entered his mouth, an explosion sounded from within the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s body. It sounded as if something had exploded within him.

Following that, he started to emit a golden radiance.

The golden light was emitted directly from his body. It was like his bones were shining with golden light.

Soon, the skin of the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster started to fall off of his body. He became a humanoid shaped pile of mutilated flesh that was shining with golden radiance.

After his skin started to fall off, his flesh also began to fall off. In the end, only his bones remained.

Round little pearls were present on his bones. Those pearls were shining golden bright.

Looking carefully, those pearls were the same golden forbidden medicines that he had swallowed earlier.

Merely, at that moment, those golden forbidden medicines had already fused with the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. They now resembled a part of the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

That said, even though he was emitting golden light, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster appeared to be extremely frightening. After all, his flesh and skin were completely gone. All that remained was his skeleton.

“Hahahaha...”

Right at that moment, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster burst into loud laughter. It was an extremely frantic and crazy laughter, so much so that the crowd was unable to endure it.

Most importantly, with his current appearance and that laughter, he was truly frightening.

“What’s wrong, grandson? D-Did you eat too m-many forbidden medicines that y-you’ve turned s-stupid?” Wang Qiang mocked.

“You will soon find out why I’m laughing,” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster said to Wang Qiang.

“Bang~~~”

Suddenly, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster moved. His speed was extremely fast. He was flying straight at Wang Qiang.

“This guy.”

At that moment, even Wang Qiang’s expression changed.

The reason for that was because the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster had arrived before Wang Qiang instantly.

That Dragonscale Dagger was already slashing down on Wang Qiang. The speed was so fast that even Wang Qiang was caught off-guard.

However, Wang Qiang was not to be underestimated either. At the critical moment, Wang Qiang managed to, with all his might, raise the Vegetable Cutting Edge in his hand.

“Clank~~~”

Sparks scattered everywhere. Wang Qiang managed to block the attack.

However, Wang Qiang was knocked back several meters after blocking the attack.

Furthermore, a deep dent had appeared in his Vegetable Cutting Edge.

Not only that, but the arm that he was holding the Vegetable Cutting Edge with started to tremble violently.

“This guy’s power, it a-actually increased t-this much?”

At that moment, Wang Qiang’s heart sunk. Even though he knew that the forbidden medicines would increase the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s strength, Wang Qiang never expected the forbidden medicine to increase his strength to such a degree.

It seemed that he was truly no match for the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster now.

“Damned stutterer, come at me. Come and fight against this Sectmaster.”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster stood where he was. He did not give chase. Instead, he began to insult Wang Qiang like Wang Qiang had insulted him earlier.

“Hehe... g-grandson, d-don’t t-think that y-your granddaddy w-will be a-afraid of you with m-merely this.”

Wang Qiang did not cower. His body shifted, and he disappeared.

When he reappeared again, he was right above the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. With the Vegetable Cutting Edge in hand, he hacked down on the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s head.

However, right at the moment when Wang Qiang’s slash was about to land, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster suddenly raised his hand. He had raised the Dragonscale Dagger above his head. Then, he slashed with it.

“Clank!” Wang Qiang was once again knocked away.

This time around, the hand and arm that Wang Qiang was holding his Vegetable Cutting Edge with started to tremble even more intensely. In fact, blood was flowing from his palm.

“Brother Wang Qiang, accept the power of the formation immediately!” Ying Mingchao shouted.

At practically the same moment Ying Mingchao shouted those words, the power of the grand formation that drew power from Zi Xunyi, Zhao Hong, Ying Mingchao and everyone else from the allied army entered Wang Qiang.

After the power of that grand formation entered Wang Qiang, Wang Qiang’s battle power increased greatly.
