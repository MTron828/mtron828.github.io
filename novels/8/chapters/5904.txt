Chapter 5905: Farewell, Danger?

Chapter 5905: Farewell, Danger?

The highest-quality treasure that required the most sacred mountain’s energy was a recovery item that healed one’s foundation. Chu Feng thought that was useful for Zi Ling’s injuries.

The second treasure was a talisman that temporarily boosted one’s observation. Chu Feng wanted to use it to see if he could enter the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city through that. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The third treasure was another recovery item, which he thought might be useful for Wen Xue.

Wen Xue did help Zi Ling and Chu Feng, so he owed her a favor.

If possible, he would have wanted to obtain a treasure that could help Eggy, but it was a pity that none of the treasures here were of use to her.

In the end, after he depleted his sacred mountain’s energy, he was enveloped by a surge of teleportation energy and brought back to where Zi Ling and the others were.

As soon as he found his footing, a huge face appeared in front of him. It was Sansheng Qiutian. “Brother Chu Feng, did you enter the Sacred Temple?”

“I did.” Chu Feng nodded.

“Heck. That’s unfair. How did you enter the Sacred Temple? You should have taught us the way to get there too!” Sansheng Qiutian pouted.

“I don’t know the specific way to enter the Sacred Temple either,” Chu Feng replied.

“Haha, I’m just pulling your leg. I have already figured out the two keys to entering the Sacred Temple!”

“Oh? What are they?”

“First and foremost, only outsiders are allowed to enter the Sacred Temple. Second, that person must have made a huge contribution to breaching the formation. That’s why you were able to enter, whereas Miss Zi Ling was stuck outside.” Sansheng Qiutian then turned to Zi Ling and said, “Miss Zi Ling, don’t misunderstand. I’m not making light of you. It’s just that Chu Feng is too outstanding.”

Zi Ling burst into laughter.

Weng!

All of a sudden, Zi Ling, Sansheng Qiutian, and Sansheng Xingyu froze in place as if they had been bound by some kind of energy. The sacred mountain’s energy surfaced from their bodies and converged into a bundle. This bundle then morphed into three different God Armaments.

These God Armaments were their rewards for breaching the formation.

“God Armaments!” Sansheng Qiutian was overjoyed.

Sansheng Xingyu was excited too.

From their expressions, it would appear that God Armaments were one of the better rewards from the sacred mountain.

After leaving the sacred mountain, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief gathered the clansmen and announced that Chu Xuanyuan had breached the formation back then, and their sacred treasure going missing was unlikely to have anything to do with him.

That caused a stir. Many people even cheered. It was evident that Chu Xuanyuan had an important place in their hearts.

Despite believing that Chu Xuanyuan had lost their sacred treasure, they still harbored no hatred toward him. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been so happy to hear that Chu Xuanyuan was innocent all along.

Chu Feng expressed that he wanted to meet the clan chief’s father, who had fallen into a coma due to the sacred treasure going missing. He wondered if he could do anything to help the latter.

However, the clan chief said that his father was currently under treatment in a formation, so Chu Feng might have to wait for a few years before he could meet the latter.

Chu Feng didn’t have the time to spare, so he decided to leave.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan expressed their reluctance to see Chu Feng leave, and they wanted to keep Chu Feng and Zi Ling with them for a while longer. However, Chu Feng stated that he had other business to deal with.

He did have things he needed to handle.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan had a teleportation formation in their city that could teleport Chu Feng and Zi Ling out of their realm, so they didn’t have to return through the same path.

All of the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen, except those who were in closed-door training, saw them off. It was quite a festive atmosphere. This was the first time Chu Feng had been so warmly received by an Ancient Era’s clan.

From this, he could tell that not all Ancient Era’s clans harbored hostility toward the present-era cultivators.

Sansheng Qiutian even cried, and he struggled to wipe off his tears and snot.

“Enough. Stop crying. It’s not as if you have known Chu Feng for years. Don’t you feel embarrassed making a spectacle out of yourself? Those who don’t know better might have thought you have fallen in love with him!” the clan chief said with a frown.

Sansheng Qiutian wiped off his snot as he bawled, “Elder Sheng told me that you also cried when you first parted ways with Elder Chu Xuanyuan. We’re both sentimental people, so why are you criticizing me now?”

“You...” The clan chief was rendered speechless. Sansheng Qiutian was right.

“Brother Qiutian, we’ll meet again.” Chu Feng patted Sansheng Qiutian’s shoulders.

“Chu Feng.” It was then that Sansheng Xingyu suddenly spoke up. “Can you promise me something?”

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I want to challenge you, but not now. I want to fight you the next time we meet,” Sansheng Xingyu said.

“Sure.” Chu Feng accepted the challenge.

He knew that Sansheng Xingyu was not a foe to be made light of—she had refrained from using her full strength the last time they competed, so he wasn’t proud of his victory either. He wanted to have a proper fight with her too.

“Chu Feng, take these.” The clan chief handed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

“Elder, I have already traded what I need with my high-tier pills from Brother Qiutian, so...”

Before Chu Feng could finish his sentence, the clan chief interjected, “I’ll be taking offense if you don’t accept my gift.”

Hearing that, Chu Feng accepted the gift and said, “Thank you, Elder Clan Chief.”

“That’s more like it.” The clan chief revealed a satisfied smile.

Just then, a voice transmission was relayed to Chu Feng. “Chu Feng, there’s something I’d like to tell you, but it’s not convenient for me to say it aloud in front of my clansmen. Nevertheless, I think it’s something you should know.”

“Go ahead, elder,” Chu Feng replied.

“Regarding that formation with rankings, your father went easy on me. He thought that such prestige would be important for me when I became the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief in the future. I did vehemently reject it back then, but your father was adamant,” the clan chief said.

“Thank you, elder.” Chu Feng would have guessed as much even if the clan chief hadn’t said it, but he appreciated the clan chief for being willing to voice it aloud.

After chatting a bit more, Chu Feng and Zi Ling stepped into the formation and bade farewell to the sacred mountain.

Shortly after Chu Feng left, Sansheng Xingyu turned to the clan chief and said, “Lord Clan Chief, I’d like to enter the Saint Cultivation Ground.”

All of the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen were startled.

The Saint Cultivation Ground was a formidable cultivation ground, where all prodigies who had been through it would undergo a metamorphosis within. All of the most talented juniors of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan had entered the Saint Cultivation Ground, except Sansheng Xingyu.

Sansheng Xingyu was the most talented junior in the Three Saints Monstrous Clan, but she had her own beliefs that kept her from entering the Saint Cultivation Ground. Her willingness to do it now was good news to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

...

Shortly after Chu Feng and Zi Ling stepped into the teleportation formation, they were transported out of the sacred mountain.

Chu Feng was filled with many thoughts. He had never thought there would be such a connection between his father and the sacred mountain realm.

All of a sudden, a surge of teleportation energy appeared out of nowhere and sought to envelop Chu Feng.

“Elder, take me away!” Chu Feng immediately sensed that something was amiss.

It was a powerful surge of teleportation energy, and it was trying to encircle them. These signaled that the person behind it was likely to be hostile. Thus, he immediately called the Divine Deer to take them away.

However, the surge of teleportation energy was so fast that it locked them down right as he blurted out those words.

The two of them were brought back into the sacred mountain realm, to the peak of the sacred mountain.

“Big brother Chu Feng.” Zi Ling leaned closer to Chu Feng as she didn’t think this bode well.

Chu Feng observed his surroundings. They had indeed returned to the sacred mountain; this wasn’t just an illusion. However, the Sacred Temple before them was not just a silhouette; it was corporeal, and its gates were wide open.

Just then, an old voice echoed, “Young friend, there’s no need to be nervous. I merely invited you back for a discussion.”
