Chapter 5940: The Cunning Immortal Slaughterer Quartet

“I forgot. Who are you two again?’ Chu Feng asked.

“Milord, I am Number Six, Fa Fan,” the rank seven Half-God level old man replied.

“Milord, I am Number Five, Qiang Yu,” the rank eight Half-God level old man replied.

“Where are your brothers?”

Chu Feng’s anger was already rising, knowing that these were the culprits who killed his grandmother’s sect. These people were extremely cunning, such that it was hard to find their whereabouts. Now that he had finally found their tail, he wanted to eradicate them in a sweep.

Thus, he curbed his rage and instead tried to gather news about the others’ whereabouts.

“Milord, are you mistaken? Only the two of us joined the Netherworld Sect,” Number Five replied.

“Is that so?” Chu Feng narrowed his eyes.

Number Five’s aura immediately rose from rank eight to rank nine Half-God level. “You aren’t from the Netherworld Sect. Who are you?”

He had sensed that something was amiss about Chu Feng, so he lied to probe Chu Feng. He could tell from Chu Feng’s answer that he didn’t know anything about them at all.

Without any hesitation, he swiped his claw at Chu Feng.

But before his claw could get close, Chu Feng unleashed a burst of spirit power that wrapped around Number Five’s claw like a rope before shattering it with a loud 'kacha'.

Sensing that the tides weren’t in his favor, Number Six immediately turned tail and fled, only to crash into an invisible barrier.

Unbeknownst to them, Chu Feng had already sealed off the area.

“Who are you?” Number Five furiously asked.

“I’ll let you die a knowing death.” Chu Feng took off his bamboo hat and revealed his true face.

“Chu Feng, it’s you? What are you doing here?”

Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Five and Number Six were shocked. They were aware of their grudge against Chu Feng, and they knew that Chu Feng had become strong from his recent feats. They knew that they were likely doomed now that they had fallen into his grasp.

“Don’t kill us, Chu Feng. I’m begging you. We have no grudge against your grandmother. Someone put us up to it. The true culprit is the Pill Dao Immortal Sect!” Number Five and Number Six begged for mercy.

“No wonder I couldn’t find you. You were hiding in the Netherworld Sect all this while! I can spare you, but you have to tell me where your brothers are. Did they join the Netherworld Sect too?”

“Chu Feng, we are the only ones who joined the Netherworld Sect. We don’t know where the others are,” Number Five replied.

“You still don’t want to speak the truth yet? It’s fine. You’ll be begging to tell me what I want soon,” Chu Feng sneered.

He tied them up with a formation rope before dragging them off. He was planning to bring them to a safer place, where he could take his time to interrogate them.

Boom!

While Chu Feng was heading off, a True God’s cultivator oppressive might suddenly crushed down from the sky.

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng activated Divine Flitting and pasted the Embryo Awakening Talisman on his head. He could feel the Netherworld Embryo within him waking up and bestowing him with a tremendous amount of energy.

Surprisingly, the Netherworld Embryo hadn’t tried to fight Chu Feng for control over his body, as Song Yun said would happen.

Furthermore, Chu Feng’s cultivation rose to rank two True God level instead of rank one.

The only downside was that there was a limit to the Netherworld Embryo’s energy bestowment. He couldn’t use his bloodline powers to further raise his cultivation, and it would be hard for him to use his martial skills with this energy too. Even his heaven-defying battle power was gone.

Even so, this was enough for Chu Feng.

He thrust his palm back at where the oppressive might had come from.

Boom!

Someone blocked Chu Feng’s palm. Two old men emerged from the direction of the assault.

One of them had his face hidden behind a mask, standing quietly with his hand behind his back. The other had a vicious-looking face.

The one who had exerted his oppressive might was the one with a vicious-looking face. His base cultivation was rank one True God level, but when Chu Feng activated his talisman, he raised his cultivation to rank two True God level.

The vicious-looking old man looked at Chu Feng and sneered in disdain, “Not bad, Chu Feng. The world only knows you are Jie Tianran’s grandson, Jie Ranqing’s son, but who could have thought that you have ties with the Netherworld Sect? To think there’s a Netherworld Embryo inside you. You can even use the Embryo Awakening Talisman with ease when others in the sect struggle to control it. You sure have hidden your means well.”

“Number Four, step down,” the masked old man interjected. He turned to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, we regret what we did to your grandmother too, but there’s no way to change what has happened. You have already killed our Number Seven and my second brother’s disciple. Since you’re a Netherworld Sectmember, and we brothers have joined the Netherworld Sect, you can say that we’re on the same boat now. Why don’t we bury the hatchet?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Bury the hatchet? Very well.” Chu Feng nodded.

However, he swung his Exalted Armament and decapitated Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Five and Number Six. Due to Protection Bane, they were killed even before their protection formation had a chance to activate.

The other two Immortal Slaughterer’s True God level cultivators were stunned.

“We’ll call it quits after I kill you seven,” Chu Feng sneered before charging at the two True God level old men.

“You’re courting death!”

Immortal Slaughter’s Number Four released a gush of killing intent. He whipped out an Exalted Armament saber and charged at Chu Feng.
