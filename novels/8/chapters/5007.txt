Chapter 5007: Entering the Northern Region

Not too long later, the Godwish Grandmother came rushing over with the unconscious Song Yun. When she saw the worried looks on the faces all around, she realized what had happened.

“Milord, y-you really planted the Netherworld Embryo in my junior’s body?”

The Godwish Grandmother cursed herself for arriving late, but she wouldn’t have been able to stop the Netherworld Envoy even if she was present.

“Don’t worry. Look, he isn’t suffering from any side effects at all. That’s the guidance of the Divine Vat. Those chosen by the Divine Vat are bound to be extraordinary. I am truly fortunate,” the Netherworld Envoy spoke with a smile.

He was also delighted to see that Chu Feng wasn’t suffering from any backlash.

“Today truly is a lucky day! Godwish Grandmother, this is all your credit. I’ll generously reward you for your contribution to our Netherworld Sect. It’s just that I have to bring them back to the Nteherworld Sect as soon as possible, so I’ll have to bid farewell right now,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

“Milord, are you intending to bring Chu Feng back to the Netherworld Sect as well?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“Of course,” the Netherworld Envoy replied.

“Milord, please bring me with you. Chu Feng is my junior. I’ve promised my master that I’ll accompany him and ensure his safety,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

“Do you think that anyone will be able to hurt him under my watch? Rest assured! Be it Chu Feng or Song Yun, they’ll be completely different people when you meet them once more,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

He bound Chu Feng with his martial power, and Song Yun also started levitating away from the Godwish Grandmother’s arms to float over to his side. He was really planning on taking them away with him.

“Wait a moment!” Chu Feng anxiously spoke up.

“Child, you should hurry up and finish up whatever you wish to say to them. Time is tight on our hand,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

“I have unsettled business to attend to. I’m willing to follow you to the Netherworld Sect, but would you allow me to stay here for a few more days to finish my affairs? It isn’t my intention to stall your time, but a life is at stake here,” Chu Feng said.

“What does other people’s life have to do with you? If there’s nothing else, we’ll set off right now.”

The Netherworld Envoy turned a blind eye to Chu Feng’s words. The next moment, Chu Feng, Song Yun, and the little girl vanished into thin air.

“Damn it! I said that we shouldn’t have come here, but you just had to insisted on it. You did manage to save your daughter in the end, but young hero Chu Feng got done in because of you! Your master told you to protect your junior, not to sabotage him!” Shengguang Baimei furiously bellowed at the Godwish Grandmother.

If not for the Godwish Grandmother insisted on coming over, Chu Feng wouldn’t have encountered all this trouble.

“What’s done is done. There’s no point blaming me now. Besides, I don’t think the Netherworld Envoy will hurt Chu Feng. If the Netherworld Sect is as evil as the rumors put them out to be, we wouldn’t have been standing here safe and sound right now,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

“Lord Baimei, calm down. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing to young friend Chu Feng,” Daoist Niantian also spoke up.

“He might not have harmed us today, but it doesn’t change the fact that the Netherworld Sect has caused the death of many innocent children. It is clearly an unorthodox sect. How could anything good come from going to a place like that?” Shengguang Baimei exclaimed indignantly.

“So what if it’s an unorthodox sect? My daughter was saved because of that unorthodox sect! I don’t think that your Holy Light Clan has the right to be pointing fingers at others. Don’t you think that your clan has a huge part to play in the decline of the Holy Light Galaxy? Hah, the number of talents who have died in the hands of your clan might just number more than that of the Netherworld Sect!” the Godwish Grandmother bellowed.

“How dare you insult our Holy Light Clan? Are you courting death?”

Shengguang Baimei glared at the Godwish Grandmother with murderous eyes.

“You want a fight? Try it then. I don’t plan on tolerating your nonsense just because you’re Junior Chu Feng’s friend!” the Godwish Grandmother snapped.

Her rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivation began flowing out, exerting immense pressure on Shengguang Baimei.

Shengguang Baimei was so infuriated that veins were popping on his neck, but he dared not to make a move. He knew that he wasn’t the Godwish Grandmother’s match.

“It could spell an opportunity for Junior Chu Feng too if the Netherworld Sect could provide him with fortuitous encounters and resources to advance his cultivation. That being said, I won’t deny that I have made a lapse in judgment today, and I’ll take full responsibility for it. However, the only ones who are qualified to blame me are Junior Chu Feng and my master. As for you, don’t even think that I’ll tolerate your nonsense!”

After saying her piece, the Godwish Grandmother turned to the Lady of Dao Sea and said, “Junior Chu Feng might be gone, but we still have to accomplish his wish for him. Let’s go and find Yin Ren.”

The two of them rose into the sky and began heading off.

Shengguang Baimei was still feeling deeply frustrated, but he eventually chose to tag along.

…

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had been forcibly taken away by the Netherworld Envoy. He tried negotiating with the Netherworld Envoy along the way, but the latter turned a blind eye to him.

The Netherworld Envoy had a black boat that traveled an incredible speed in ancient teleportation formations, faster than any treasure Chu Feng possessed. That greatly shortened the length of their journey.

As a result, Chu Feng could only watch helplessly as he was taken out of the Eastern Region.

The Netherworld Sect was moving too swiftly. He didn’t just travel in a straight path; he would alternate among various ancient teleportation formations, constantly changing his route. It was likely that he knew of some kind of detour to maximize their traveling speed.

Soon, they stepped foot into the Northern Region of the vast world of cultivation, the Totem Galaxy.

The atmosphere of the Totem Galaxy was very different from what Chu Feng was used to. The cultivators of Totem Galaxy were, on average, stronger than those in the Nine Souls Galaxy, let alone the Holy Light Galaxy. However, the gap in cultivation wasn’t just the result of a difference in talent.

Chu Feng could feel that the energies in the surroundings were much more condensed than that of the Nine Souls Galaxy and the Holy Light Galaxy, and they were much easier to absorb too. There was also martial comprehension weaved into them that could be easily grasped.

These were important resources for cultivators to achieve breakthroughs.

To use an analogy, a child who grew up eating only greens was bound to be weaker than a child who grew up eating meat. It was the difference in their surroundings that gave rise to such a massive difference in their abilities as cultivators.

Along the way, Song Yun and the little girl remained unconscious, so the Netherworld Envoy chose to put them into his formation. Chu Feng was curious about the little girl’s enigmatic background, so he wanted to find an opportunity to talk to her. It was unfortunate that the latter was unconscious all this while, so he could only patiently wait for an opportunity.

“Is the Netherworld Sect located in the Totem Galaxy?” Chu Feng suddenly asked the Netherworld Envoy.

He was curious because they had spent most of their time traveling through teleportation formations. Even when they exited from a teleportation formation, they would swiftly rush into the next one.

However, the Netherworld Envoy suddenly moved in a peculiar direction after leaving the previous teleportation formation. He led them into a vast forest, where they would stumble upon other cultivators from time to time. Instead of rushing on, he began scanning their surroundings intently, seemingly searching for something.

For that reason, Chu Feng thought that they might have arrived at their destination. Otherwise, it would mean that the Netherworld Envoy had something he was intending to do here. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Our destination isn’t the Totem Galaxy. I only stopped here to see if I can procure a delicacy from the Totem Galaxy,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

“Delicacy? What kind of delicacy?”

Chu Feng’s interest was piqued.

The Netherworld Envoy was in such a rush to return to the Netherworld Sect, but he actually took a detour in order to seek out this delicacy. It was likely that there was something more to this delicacy.

“You wouldn’t have tried it before. It’s a delicacy that even natives of the Totem Galaxy crave but are unable to get their hands on. Let’s see if luck is with us today,” the Netherworld Envoy replied secretively.
