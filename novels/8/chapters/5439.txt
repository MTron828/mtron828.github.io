Chapter 5439: Opening the Gates of the Masses

The World Spiritist Painter returned to the palace and informed Chu Feng about his intention to open the Gate of the Masses.

The Gate of the Masses was a painting containing a powerful formation, and it consisted of innumerable spatial realms. Those who stepped into it would be transported to different realms, and each of them contained its own fortuitous encounters.

Thus, Chu Feng could also enter the Gate of the Masses without worrying about the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s vengeance.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you have done me a huge favor by dealing with the black aura. I’ll protect you till you leave Painter Mountain, so you may enter the Gate of the Masses without any reservation!” the World Spiritist Painter said.

“Elder, I don’t mind concealing myself.”

Chu Feng didn’t want to cause further trouble to the World Spiritist Painter. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect was a powerhouse in the Totem Galaxy, after all.

“Young friend Chu Feng, just do as I say,” the World Spiritist Painter replied with a chuckle. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Chu Feng clasped his fist and accepted the World Spiritist Painter’s goodwill, saying, “I’ll be counting on you then, elder.”

The World Spiritist Painter then headed to the peak of the All Lives Are Equal Palace and announced, “I hereby announce the opening of the Gate of the Masses. Those present here will be allowed to enter the Gate of the Masses.”

The World Spiritist Painter waved his sleeves and tossed a scroll into the sky. The scroll was initially only half a meter long, but it swiftly expanded till it was over ten thousand meters wide.

The scroll rolled down from the sky, stopping just right above the All Lives Are Equal Palace to reveal an incomparably huge painting. It depicted a grand scenery that encapsulated an entire world within a painting.

At the center of the painting were four glowing words: Gate of the Masses.

Clearly, this incomparably huge painting was the Gate of the Masses.

The crowd, including those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, was excited to see the incomparably huge painting. Those who entered the Gate of the Masses would have a chance to obtain its fortuitous encounter, albeit the chances being slim.

“The Gate of the Masses is truly a formidable treasure,” Jia Lingyi stood atop her warship as she remarked. Her eyes were filled with not just excitement but greed as well.

However, her gaze turned cold when she noticed an individual stepping out of the All Lives Are Equal Palace to walk toward the World Spiritist Painter. That individual was none other than Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng!!!”

A huge commotion broke out the moment Chu Feng appeared.

His portrait had swiftly spread far and wide after his name became known, to the point where most people recognized him despite not having seen him in person. Many people in the Totem Galaxy were curious about him after learning about his affairs and wanted to meet him.

The crowd was visibly excited to see Chu Feng, for they had a feeling that he was going to achieve great things in the future.

“Chu Feng!!!”

Following a furious roar, a formation saber filled with killing intent flew out of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s warship to split Chu Feng into half. Before the formation saber could reach its target, it shattered into fragments.

The World Spiritist Painter had made his move.

Numerous figures flew out of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect in a neat formation, looking at if they were going to start a war.

“World Spiritist Painter, why are you shielding Chu Feng? Are you in cahoots with him?” Emboldened by the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, the elder standing at the forefront of this formation fearlessly questioned the World Spiritist Painter.

“Young friend Chu Feng helped me greatly in dealing with the earlier intruder. I don’t care if there’s an enmity between the two of you, but I won’t allow anyone to harm him here. Anyone who dares to touch him here is my enemy!”

The crowd was surprised. They didn’t think that Chu Feng would have played a part in dealing with the earlier crisis. Regardless of the means he had used to fend off the black aura, the fact he succeeded showed that he possessed extraordinary skills.

The crowd was also surprised that the Pill Dao Immortal Sect dared to make a move on Chu Feng after the Totem Nine Daoists had declared that they would protect Chu Feng.

“What airs, World Spiritist Painter.” The old man’s face turned frigid as he readied himself to make a move.

“Come back! How can you disrespect the World Spiritist Painter?”

A woman walked out from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s warship. It was Jia Lingyi. Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect quickly obeyed her orders and returned to the warship. After all, this was an order from the favored little daughter of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s sectmaster.

“World Spiritist Painter, please forgive them. They don’t know their manners,” Jia Lingyi said with a smile.

“It’s fine.” The World Spiritist Painter nonchalantly waved his hand.

Jia Lingyi then turned her attention toward Chu Feng, and the latter did the same. Their eyes were filled with hostility even though neither of them said a word. Just as everyone thought that she would confront Chu Feng over their grudges, she suddenly flung her sleeves and returned to the warship.

Of course, she wasn’t going to let things rest that easily, but she knew that it wasn’t the time to confront Chu Feng and the World Spiritist Painter yet.

In truth, she had secretly used a formation earlier to suppress Chu Feng so as to humiliate him, but the more she looked into Chu Feng’s eyes, the more vividly she could feel his killing intent. His killing intent quickly rippled through her heart, tainting her soul with endless darkness.

Fear began to grip her despite her anger. She realized that she might just lose her nerves at this rate and embarrass herself.

“I definitely can’t spare Chu Feng,” Jia Lingyi murmured under her breath.
