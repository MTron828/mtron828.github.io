Chapter 5762: Galaxy-level Power

While the experts outside were startled by the golden aura enveloping the realm, in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, a whiff of golden aura had appeared in Chu Feng’s cultivation ground and was slowly interweaving with his bloodline power.

There was a clash involving three parties.

The Heavenly Lightning Bloodline and the Ruler’s Bloodline were working together to suppress the golden aura, but the golden aura was extremely arrogant, displaying no fear despite being faced with two extremely powerful bloodlines. It acted as if it was invincible in the world, and it even attempted to attack Chu Feng.

Unfortunately for the golden aura, attitude had to be backed up with strength.

The golden aura was formidable, such that it could have momentarily stood against either the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline or the Ruler’s Bloodline. However, it was faced with the combined assault of the two bloodlines here. It didn’t take long for it to be suppressed.

While the amount of golden aura that had emerged in Chu Feng’s cultivation ground was small, it was concentrated energy, with not the slightest impurity in it. In contrast, the golden aura that had enveloped the realm was mixed with the phenomenon, such that it was hard to tell whether what was real and what was fake.

The golden aura calmed down under the suppression of Chu Feng’s two bloodlines until it was no longer violent. Only then did Chu Feng’s Ruler’s Bloodline and Heavenly Lightning Bloodline retract into his body.

“I’d have never thought there’s such a benefit hidden in the cultivation ground. What kind of power is that?”

Chu Feng got up and examined the golden aura he had received from the cultivation ground, but he was unable to tell what it was. He tried using his detection means, his formations, and even his Divine Eyes, but he couldn’t discern anything. He tried using the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk too, but he didn’t receive any guidance.

In the end, he could only evaluate the golden aura solely using his instincts. He only had three words for it—strong and mysterious.

“Forget it. I’ll just assimilate it.”

In spite of being unable to determine the nature of the golden aura, Chu Feng sat down and tried to assimilate it.

That proceeded smoothly.

The golden aura didn’t boost Chu Feng’s cultivation or spirit power, but it granted him greater control over his bloodline. It was unlike the Dao of Specialization, in the sense that it worked on not just his Heavenly Bloodline but his Ruler’s Bloodline too.

He projected his consciousness into his dantian to look at the powerful red lightning beast once more, and to his delight, he was finally able to get a glimpse of the latter’s powers.

“Is this its power? I’m looking forward to it.”

Chu Feng was overjoyed despite the lack of advancement in his cultivation or fighting prowess. He understood how significant the benefits of the golden aura were to him.

“Congratulations, Brother Chu Feng,” Liu Kuo’s voice echoed outside.

Chu Feng quickly got up and headed out. Liu Kuo was standing outside. It was only then that he noticed the phenomenon in the sky, which symbolized the clearing of the assessment formation and the official commencement of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

“Brother Liu Kuo, was I the one who cleared the assessment formation?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course, but Brother Chu Feng, you did more than clear the assessment formation. You awakened a formidable power,” Liu Kuo said.

“Brother Liu Kuo, do you know what that is?” Chu Feng asked.

Instead of directly answering the question, Liu Kuo replied with a question of his own, “Brother Chu Feng, you’re from the Eastern Region. Have you heard of the Soul Fog?”

“Yes, I’ve heard of it,” Chu Feng replied.

The Soul Fog was the legendary power hidden in the Nine Souls Galaxy, existing in the form of a green gas. Whenever it appeared, all beings trembled.

“That makes it easier for me. Rumor has it that a legendary power lies in each of the galaxies. Some have been unearthed, but some remain uncovered. The legendary power lying in the Nine Souls Galaxy is none other than the Soul Fog, and what you have just witnessed is the legendary power of the Bloodline Galaxy—Genesis Bloodline,” Liu Kuo replied.

“Genesis Bloodline? What does it do?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s what I wanted to ask you, Brother Chu Feng. What’s the use of the Genesis Bloodline?” Liu Kuo asked with a smile.

“I assimilated a portion of it earlier, but it only enhanced my bloodline power by a bit. There was no effect on my cultivation and fighting prowess at all,” Chu Feng replied.

“It’s true, after all,” Liu Kuo remarked.

“Brother Liu Kuo, stop beating around the bush and tell me.” Chu Feng was dying with curiosity.

“The Nine Souls Sacred Clan was extremely powerful in the earlier of the present era, mainly because they had a monopoly over the Soul Fog. The Soul Fog is a potent cultivation resource, but it has to be paired with certain bloodlines. Not all cultivators are suited to assimilate it. It happens that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s bloodline is highly compatible with the Soul Fog.

“The Genesis Bloodline has never been awakened before, and we only know about its name and location from an Ancient Era’s record. Nevertheless, from its name, many speculated that it’s a cultivation resource that enhances one’s bloodline power,” Liu Kuo said.

“What I assimilated was just a small part of it?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. The real Genesis Bloodline is outside,” Liu Kuo said as he rotated his prayer beads and imbued one of its formations into Chu Feng’s eyes.

The formation allowed Chu Feng to see the scenery outside of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, and the first thing he noticed was the golden aura enveloping the entire realm.

“There’s so much of it?” Chu Feng was overjoyed.

He had already benefited from it just by assimilating a small portion of it. If he could take in all of it, his cultivation and fighting prowess would surely grow by leaps and bounds.

Soon, Liu Kuo took back the formation, and Chu Feng’s eyes reverted to normal.

“You might have awakened the Genesis Bloodline, but that doesn’t mean it’s yours yet. What you’re seeing isn’t even its true form. You’ll have to draw it out yourself,” Liu Kuo said.
