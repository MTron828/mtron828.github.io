Chapter 4987: Helpless

Chu Feng and the others were still trapped in the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound. They found themselves helpless in the situation they were in.

Weng!

The space in the distance suddenly began to tremble, and an item appeared in mid-air shortly after.

It was an incense stick, one so massive that it towered at a height of ten thousand meters. It looked like a bizarre floating mountain, but the scented smoke it was emanated made it clear that it was an incense stick.

“Why would this thing appear here all of a sudden? Is this some sort of hint?”

Chu Feng and the others turned their attention toward the incense stick, hoping to get a clue as to what they should do.

It was then that a voice echoed from the direction of the incense stick.

“Once the incense stick burns out, the flame will engulf this world. If you aren’t able to decipher the mechanism before the incense stick burns out, the only fate that awaits you is death.”

The voice belonged to the humanoid monster made out of black mist whom they had encountered at the entrance of the ancient remnant.

“Elder, there’s no pattern to the fireballs at all. How can we decipher this?” Chu Feng asked.

He knew that the humanoid monster must be looking at them from somewhere.

“Doesn’t that lass in the second place have a clue in her hands? You can get it from her. She should be willing to fork it out now that your lives are at stake,” the humanoid monster said with a laugh.

Chu Feng and the others immediately turned their eyes toward Song Yun.

“I don’t have such a thing.”

Song Yun shook her head innocently.

“Think harder. Did your mother hand you anything?” Chu Feng asked.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I remember it now. My mother gave this to me, saying that it’ll protect me. However, she didn’t say what its purpose is.”

Song Yun took out a blue pearl that emanated an aura similar to the world they were in. However, it was hard to tell what its use was.

“Just this?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, it’s just this. My mother said that it’ll protect me as long as I carry it with me, so I’ve been keeping it on me. I didn’t think that it would be a clue to this place. I’ve also tried inspecting it, but I don’t think there’s anything reminiscent of a clue on it,” Song Yun replied indignantly.

It looked as if she really wasn’t aware of this matter.

“Elder, is the clue you mentioned this pearl?” Chu Feng turned to the incense stick and asked.

“Why don’t you ask me to lead you straight to Lord Monstrous King’s soul instead? If you need me to babysit you through everything, what rights do you have to obtain Lord Monstrous King’s soul?” the humanoid monster scoffed.

Clearly, it wasn’t planning on providing them with any other clues. Chu Feng and the others only had themselves to count on.

So, Chu Feng took a closer look at the pearl.

“Can I experiment something with this pearl?” Chu Feng asked Song Yun.

“Of course. We’re already in a precarious position. I’ll do whatever you tell me to do,” Song Yun replied obediently.

Chu Feng raised his hand and tossed the pearl outward. He couldn’t tell what the pearl was for, so he decided to opt for the most direct method.

Boom!

The pearl was extremely small, but it still swiftly triggered a fireball after being thrown out.

To everyone’s surprise, the pearl produced a blue barrier that blocked off the fireball.

“That pearl does have its uses here.”

Chu Feng and the others were delighted to see that.

That simplified things. All they needed to do was to have the pearl scout out the way for them so that they could proceed ahead. Even if things went wrong, the pearl would be able to block off the fireball for them.

“No, that’s not right.”

Before Chu Feng could take back the pearl, the pearl’s barrier suddenly morphed into a blue aura that enveloped the land. All of the fireballs showed themselves for just a brief instant, but Chu Feng managed to catch sight of them.

Everything reverted back to normal the next instant. The blue aura vanished, and the revealed fireballs disappeared from view once more. Even the pearl had vanished as well.

The sight left everyone feeling despair.

The fireball mechanism around them was still active, and the massive incense stick in the sky was still burning down. Despite its huge size, it was burning at a rate that didn’t differ much from an ordinary incense stick.

They didn’t have much time left.

“Junior Yun’er, do you have more of that pearl?” Wang Yuxian asked.

“That’s the only one I have,” Song Yun replied.

“Did Elder Godwish Grandmother entrust you with anything else?” Wang Yuxian asked.

“She only gave me that pearl,” Song Yun relied.

A tight furrow formed on Wang Yuxian’s forehead.

She hadn’t been idling her time away over the last few days. She had been trying her best to find a way out of the fireball mechanism too, but she wasn’t able to figure anything out.

“Don’t worry, I have an idea. We should be able to make it in time,” Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.

It was only then that Song Yun, Zi Ling, and Wang Yuxian realized that Chu Feng had sat down with his legs crossed. He was forming a series of hand seals with closed eyes.

It looked like he was cultivating.
