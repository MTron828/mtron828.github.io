Chapter 5608: Killing With a Single Slash

Chapter 5608: Killing With a Single Slash

It was true that the protective formation was far beyond Chu Feng’s means to deal with, but back in Painter Mountain, he created a secret skill, Dark Plunder, and acquired the formation, Protection Bane.

Protection Bane was a formation that unconditionally unraveled any protective formation. It didn’t matter how powerful or enigmatic the protective formation was; it meant nothing before Protection Bane.

In fact, Chu Feng could have silently destroyed the protective formation, and no one would have known that he was the culprit. He had intentionally left it intact because he wanted the Immortal Slaughterer to know he was the culprit.

“W-what are you doing?” the old man behind the formation asked in disbelief.

“What am I doing? I am letting you know that your protective formation is useless before me. Weasels from the Immortal Slaughterer, did you think that you are the ones hunting me down from the shadows? I’ll have you know today that you can’t be more wrong. You are the ones in the open, especially with how little you know about my means. This is nothing but the start. I’ll hunt all of you down one by one; no one will be spared. Don’t worry, it’ll be your turn very soon,” Chu Feng said as the two voids looming above the protective formation shattered, indicating that the protective formation had been rendered ineffective.

“W-wait, don’t kill me! I don’t even know you at all. What the Immortal Slaughterer did has nothing to do with me!” The young man cried for mercy, showing none of the confidence he displayed just a moment ago.

“I’ll ask you two questions. Answer them honestly,” Chu Feng said.

“G-go ahead, young hero! I’ll tell you everything I know!” The young man profusely nodded.

“First question. Where are the Immortal Slaughterer’s members, and how powerful are they?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am not an official member of the Immortal Slaughterer yet. I’m just the disciple of the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number 2. I have met the other members before, but they have never shown their cultivation and means before me, and I have never seen their true faces too. It’s the same for my master too. I only know that he’s the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number 2, but I have no idea what his name is or what he looks like.

“Ahhh! I remember it now! The Immortal Slaughterer’s Number is a person named Qiang Yu. He’s the only one who didn’t conceal his name! As for where they reside, I’m afraid that I don’t know at all. My master is usually the one who comes and looks for me. That’s all I know!” the young man said with quivering lips.

Chu Feng had been assessing the young man’s reaction. He could tell that the young man was scared out of his wits, and the only thing on his mind at the moment was how he could survive this ordeal. He was speaking the truth.

“One more question. Do you think that I should spare someone who colluded with the Immortal Slaughterer to commit all kinds of atrocities?” Chu Feng asked.

“I…”

Pu!

Before the young man could offer his answer, Chu Feng had already plunged his formation sword into the other party’s throat and claimed his life. This was his answer to the question. Everyone from the Immortal Slaughterer had to die, regardless of whether they participated in the incident back then or not.

He was already kind enough to grant the young man a fast death.

After killing the young man, Chu Feng took his origin energies and scraped all of his treasures clean. Only then did he turn his attention back to the old man.

“Y-y-y-y-young…” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The old man was so scared that he stuttered again. It was hard to tell that he was intimidated by how Chu Feng showed no fear toward the Immortal Slaughterer or how smooth his movements were in collecting the young man’s origin energies and scavenging his treasures.

By now, he knew that Chu Feng had previously spared him not because he was a kind person. Chu Feng’s guts and viciousness far surpassed him. He couldn’t help but wonder what kind of power could have nurtured such a vicious little demon clothed in human skin.

“Hoh? You are a smart one!” Chu Feng chuckled upon seeing the old man.

The old man was wearing a mask—he had put it on before the young man’s protective formation manifested. He was aware that some protective formations were linked to powerful experts, and it was possible for the powerful expert to see them through the protective formation. He didn’t want to be implicated in the matter, so he quickly disguised himself.

It was the right thing to do.

The old man would have died if the members of the Immortal Slaughterer saw his appearance. Even if he was just a bystander in this matter, the Immortal Slaughterer would have still hunted him down to question him about the events here, as well as Chu Feng’s whereabouts.

And regardless of whether the old man was honest or not, there was only one fate awaiting him. Both he and his clan would disappear from the face of the world.

That was how the Immortal Slaughterer operated.

“Young hero, it’s not that I’m afraid of death, but…”

The old man wanted to explain his cowardice, but Chu Feng interrupted him and said, “You don’t have to explain. Go. This matter has nothing to do with you. Here, I’ll give this to you.”

Chu Feng tossed the token he had just acquired from the floating light bundle to the old man. He had inspected the token and verified that it was useful, but this wasn’t the best token here. He was going to find a better one, so there was no point for him to keep it.

Looking back, he would have never uncovered the young man’s identity if the old man hadn’t fought him for the token. While the young man was only the disciple of Immortal Slaughterer’s Number 2, it was still exhilarating to get rid of a vermin.
