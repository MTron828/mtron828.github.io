Chapter 5972: Joining Hands

“Young hero Chu Feng, isn’t there a teleportation formation there? You can leave through there. They won’t be able to capture you.”

The one who spoke was Daoist Fourth Dragon. He was pointing toward the spirit formation gate Chu Feng had just walked out of.

The spirit formation gate had transformed after Chu Feng came out.

Chu Feng knew that if he stepped into the spirit formation gate once more, it would lead him out of the remnant. His grasp of this spirit formation gate surpassed the Totem Nine Daoists, especially since he was the one who obtained the treasure.

This spirit formation gate was prepared for Chu Feng, not the Totem Nine Daoists.

However, Chu Feng was still nervous despite knowing he could leave through the spirit formation gate. He remembered that explosion he had heard earlier, as well as Jie Tian’s confident demeanor. All of these told him that there was more to the situation.

Thus, he turned to Daoist First Dragon and said, “Elder, I’ll be honest with you. I have a grudge against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, which is why they are determined to capture me.

“They know that I was clearing this remnant, and they should have learned that its treasure is gone by now. Yet, they aren’t anxious at all. I suspect that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has something up their sleeves. That’s why I am worried even though this spirit formation gate takes me out of this remnant.

“I could be overthinking it, but to be safe, I wish to have you accompany me out. If something does happen, I want you to lend me a helping hand to escape from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“I’d also understand if you aren’t willing to help me. If so, I’ll deal with this matter myself.”

As soon as these words were spoken, the Totem Nine Daoists, except for Daoist First Draogn and Daoist Second Dragon, exchanged conflicted looks.

Chu Feng wasn’t familiar with Daoist Third Dragon and Daoist Fourth Dragon. Judging from their expressions, they were reluctant to help him. He could understand them not wanting to offend the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, considering how powerful they were.

The other daoists who were acquainted with Chu Feng were inclined to help him, but they dared not to make that decision due to the limitations of their strength.

In truth, the only ones who could decide this matter were Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon.

“Young hero Chu Feng, let’s travel together. We, the Totem Nine Daoists, will ensure your safety even if it means falling out with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Daoist First Dragon said.

The other daoists, except for Daoist Second Dragon, were surprised to hear that, whether they were inclined to help Chu Feng or not. They hadn’t expected Daoist First Dragon to be willing to go that far for Chu Feng.

“Big brother...” Daoist Fourth Dragon spoke up.

“Let me finish my piece first,” Daoist First Dragon interjected.

He reached into his ear and dug out a worm. Upon closer examination, that worm turned out to be a treasure with a formation embedded in it.

“We did obtain Jie Tianran’s formation deciphering sequence, but I could tell that someone has been observing us through this item ever since we entered the remnant. It’s such an ingenious method that I wasn’t sure of it till later on. We are indeed being spied on, and the ones behind it are likely the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“Jie Tianran exposed his formation deciphering sequence to use us to verify whether his sequence is right or not. If it works, he’ll snatch the treasure from our hands. If it doesn’t work, we’ll just become cannon fodder for him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“It looks as if we have stumbled upon a fortuitous encounter, but in truth, he’s just using us as sacrificial pawns.”

The other daoists were angered to hear Daoist First Dragon’s words.

“That darned Jie Tianran!”

They did reserve their suspicions, thinking that it was surprising that they had obtained such confidential information from Jie Tianran so easily. Daoist First Dragon’s words verified their doubts.

“The nine of us would have died if not for young hero Chu Feng. I can’t find a reason not to help him,” Daoist First Dragon said. He turned to Daoist Fourth Dragon and asked, “Fourth brother, what were you planning to say earlier?”

Daoist Fourth Dragon quickly replied, “Big brother, I wanted to say that I support your decision.”

Daoist First Dragon nodded. He turned to the others and asked, “Brothers, do any of you object to my decision?”

“We support big brother’s decision. We have to support young hero Chu Feng!”

The other daoists also expressed their stance.

“Thank you, elders.” Chu Feng bowed.

“Young hero Chu Feng, you’re being too courteous. We’re just doing what we should.”

Daoist First Dragon walked up to Chu Feng and passed the Cosmos Sack that Chu Feng had previously rejected back to him. “You should take this. It’s a token of our goodwill, else I’d think that you are reluctant to befriend us, the Totem Nine Daoists.”

“I’ll humbly accept your gift.” Chu Feng took the Cosmos Sack.

Boom!

The formation realm suddenly shook violently. Both the earth and the sky cracked. A terrifying aura flowed out from the crack.

This was a sign that the formation realm was about to be destroyed.

“Young hero Chu Feng, we should get going,” Daoist First Dragon said.

Chu Feng rose to the sky and made his way to the spirit formation gate. He formed a hand seal, and the spirit formation gate began emanating a peculiar gleam.

“Elders, who wish to leave first?” Chu Feng asked.

The daoists were at a loss, but Daoist First Dragon replied, “We’re fine either way.”

“I shall decide on your behalf then.”

Chu Feng changed his hand seal. A ray of light shone forth from the spirit formation gate and enveloped Daoist First Dragon before dragging him into the spirit formation gate. The same light subsequently enveloped the other daoists too.

After the Totem Nine Daoists left, Chu Feng finally released his hand seal and stepped into the spirit formation gate himself. He was transported into a teleportation passageway.

“Jie Tian, let’s see if you are the real deal or are just putting on a brave front.”
