Chapter 4069 - Poisonous Substance Flaring Up

“The reputation of the Purple Star Wisterias is well-deserved.”

“Chu Feng, if you are to refine all this power yourself, your cultivation will definitely be able to progress a lot,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said as he looked to Chu Feng.

“Lord Clan Chief, even if I am to refine all the energies here, it will not provide me with a lot of assistance,” Chu Feng shook his head.

“Not a lot of assistance?”

Both the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Hanpeng were surprised to hear those words.

They were able to sense how powerful the energies surging within the spirit formation were.

Sensing their power, they could only gasp with admiration at how the reputation of the Purple Star Wisterias was well-deserved.

As for the legendary Flower Sea King, it was also something legendary.

But, Chu Feng actually said that such precious cultivation resources would not be able to provide assistance to him?

This... shouldn’t be the case, no?

“While it is true that the Purple Star Wisterias contain a very powerful amount of natural energies that even contain martial comprehension.”

“The martial comprehension is not very profound, that makes it so that they’re relatively easy to comprehend.”

“Unfortunately, cultivation resources like the Purple Star Wisterias would not be able to provide much help to me.”

“I’ve already gathered a great amount of natural energies in my body.”

“What I need now is not natural energy. Instead, I need to gain more martial comprehension.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Sadly, what I’ve trained in is the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Thus, as my cultivation increases, I am able to sense with greater clarity how the difficulty of the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique continues to increase.”

“Because of the difficulty of the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, the power and energies from the Purple Star Wisterias are not much help to me,” said Chu Feng.

“The Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique is making it more difficult for you to reach a breakthrough?” asked the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Correct. The increase in difficulty is not small either. The closer to the Utmost Exalted realm I reach, the more difficult it becomes,” said Chu Feng.

What Chu Feng said was actually the truth.

During recent days when he had entered closed-door training, he had not only attempted to refine the Sacred Tree Seed, but he had also attempted to use his own comprehensive abilities to make a breakthrough in cultivation.

Unfortunately, the gate blocking his progress to the next level was very firm.

Chu Feng actually found himself unable to determine a way to make a breakthrough.

“Why would the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, such a high level mysterious technique, not be helping you, and obstruct your progress instead?” Chu Hanpeng narrowed his brows. He seemed to be crying out against injustice for Chu Feng.

“For everything beneficial, there is something detrimental. That mysterious technique is not something that ordinary people can handle to begin with.”

“Being able to successfully learn it is merely the first step. Being able to master it is the critical aspect.”

“That said, I believe that Chu Feng would be able to solve the difficulty before him,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I am also confident. Rest assured, I will be able to handle things.”

“While I am unable to use the Purple Star Wisterias, you all will be able to use them.”

“Especially to the younger generations of our clan, the Purple Star Wisterias would provide them with enormous assistance,” said Chu Feng.

“Such amazing cultivation resources will not only be beneficial to the younger generations; it would benefit our entire Chu Heavenly Clan,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said emotionally.

He originally planned to have Chu Feng use all of these precious cultivation resources.

However, since Chu Feng was not planning to use them, he decided to give them to the entire Chu Heavenly Clan to use.

Should they control their usage, then, not to mention all the clansmen now, even many future generations of their Chu Heavenly Clansmen would also be able to benefit from the Purple Star Wisterias.

After all, the Purple Star Wisterias they’d obtained were not only mature, but their numbers were also in the tens of thousands.

Both the quality and quantity were more than sufficient.

“Wuuu~~~”

Suddenly, the smiling Chu Feng suddenly revealed a frown.

Then, his expression distorted.

Seeing that something was amiss, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Hanpeng immediately began to examine Chu Feng.

Upon doing so, their faces turned ashen with fear. They were so terrified that they nearly scared their souls away.

Chu Feng’s current condition was extremely bad.

His face and body were covered in fine bloody lines.

The bloody lines seemed alive, and were wriggling in Chu Feng’s skin. They seemed extremely strange.

When the bloody lines appeared, Chu Feng’s aura became extremely weak, like a dying person.

Chu Feng did not scream in pain. He had no strength to scream. He didn’t even have the strength to stand.

“Chu Feng, what’s happened to you?!”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately supported Chu Feng and began to treat him.

However, right after he infused his spirit power into Chu Feng’s body to treat him, he was stunned.

He was able to sense that the bloody lines were not only present on Chu Feng’s body, but they also filled the insides of his body.

The bloody lines were like bloody shackles tied to his life.

A moment of carelessness would allow those shackles to take Chu Feng’s life.

Not to mention treating Chu Feng’s injury, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not even dare to continue to observe his condition. He immediately removed his spirit power from Chu Feng’s body.

He was deeply afraid that he would not be able to help, but would instead harm Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, what is this thing?”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was truly scared. Panic filled his voice.

“It’s poison,” Chu Feng said with a weak voice.

“Poison? When did you receive such a poison?” asked the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

However, Chu Feng was powerless to explain.

“Quickly! Onward at full speed! To the Purple Star Hall!” shouted the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Chu Feng understood the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s intention.

He must want to seek help from the Purple Star Hall.

Seeing that, Chu Feng gathered his remaining strength and grabbed the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s sleeve.

Weakly, he said, “Lord Clan Chief, they won’t be able to help with my poison.”

“If they’re not careful, I’ll die,” said Chu Feng.

“This... how were you inflicted with such a strong poison?”

“Exactly what happened?”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was truly worried. Although he had always been calm and steady, he was now panicking and at a loss as to what to do.

“It’s fine. I can handle it. I know how to remove this poison.”

“Don’t have anyone help me. I’ll handle it myself.”

“I just need some time.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng closed his eyes.

Seeing that, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had no choice but to give a strict order to not allow anyone to disturb Chu Feng.

What he didn’t know was that Chu Feng was lying to him. Chu Feng had no idea how to take care of this poison at all.

This poison was the poisonous substance the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound’s mysterious existence had left in Chu Feng’s body.

It has been some time since that poisonous substance had entered Chu Feng’s body. Yet, it had never once flared up.

Chu Feng had no idea why it suddenly flared up today.

That mysterious existence had left this poison in his body with a purpose.

That existence most likely had something it needed his help with.

However, at that time, Chu Feng’s cultivation was insufficient, and he was unable to help him.

Because of that, he took Chu Feng’s Qilin Egg and left this poisonous substance in his body.

He then told Chu Feng to become an Utmost Exalted within ten years, and then return to the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound to find him.

That mysterious existence did not inform Chu Feng what he wanted him to do.

Back then, that mysterious existence had warned him to not think about removing this poison, because the poison could not be removed.

If he were to rashly attempt to remove the poison, it would take his life.

Even though Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist now, he still could not do anything about the poison.

All he was capable of doing right now, was tolerating the torment brought forth by the poisonous substance and quietly wait for it to go away.

As for the so-called method to remove the poison, it was nothing more than a lie he told the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief upon seeing how worried he was.
