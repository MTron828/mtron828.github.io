Chapter 4097 - Powerful Bloodline

“Amazing.”

Chu Feng was completely stunned by the scene before him.

Even his blood was beginning to boil.

Even though he already knew that his bloodline was very powerful, he did not imagine that it would be this powerful.

After that cultivation treasure released the enormous body of light, and especially after seeing that the body of light had successfully captured countless other bloodline powers, Chu Feng had thought that his own nine enormous lightning beasts would also be captured.

He had thought that he would not be able to escape this calamity.

However, judging from how things were now, he discovered that his worries were unnecessary.

Without a doubt, that body of light was extremely powerful. Else, it wouldn’t have successfully captured that many other bloodline powers.

However, with even less of a need for doubt, that body of light was simply unable to even fight against Chu Feng’s nine giant lightning beasts.

Not even Chu Feng himself had anticipated that his bloodline power would be this strong.

Even though the current Chu Feng was simply unable to control his powerful bloodline, he still felt proud upon thinking of how that bloodline power belonged to him.

That sort of pridefulness sprang up unbidden.

“How could this be? How could there be such a terrifying bloodline?”

“This is simply not a bloodline power. Bloodline power couldn’t possibly be this strong.”

“There are nine monsters in this brat’s dantian,” the cultivation treasure complained as it screamed in pain.

Helplessness, unreconciliation and regret filled its voice.

Immediately afterward, it turned around and began to fly away. It was attempting to escape.

“Zzzzz~~~”

However, it only managed to fly for a short distance when a lightning bolt streaked across the sky and chased after it.

Even though it was only a single lightning bolt, it was akin to a colossus when compared to the size of that little girl.

Before that lightning, that little girl could not even be said to be an ant. Instead, she was simply a speck of dust.

As the lightning swept across, space itself split open, and the little girl’s body disappeared.

That treasure’s body had been destroyed.

“Rumble~~~”

Then, even more ear-piercing rumbles exploded.

It was that body of light that had imprisoned countless lightning beasts. It exploded.

Following the explosion, overwhelming might scattered forth.

Defeated. That cultivation treasure was thoroughly defeated.

Seeing that the outcome had been determined, the nine enormous lightning beasts began to shrink in size and return to their original appearance.

Then, they all left without a second thought. Only some disintegrated bits of lightning remained on the battlefield.

It was remnant lightning left behind from the explosion of that body of light.

Apart from that, nothing else was left.

“Could it be that that cultivation treasure has been killed like that?”

“My bloodline power is simply too powerful.”

Even though the battle had ended, Chu Feng still had a look of astonishment on his face the entire time.

He had learned that the so-called cultivation treasure had entered his body for the sake of robbing him of his bloodline power.

But, evidently, that cultivation treasure failed. Not only that, but it also ended up dying because of its failure.

“Wait, something’s amiss. I’ve clearly passed its test, why would it still attempt to plunder my bloodline power?”

“Could it be that I’ve not passed its test at all? Instead, it decided to not directly kill me after discovering my bloodline power, and instead chose to rob me of my bloodline power first?”

“Furthermore, what is that protective formation it spoke of?”

“Could it be that father truly left something in my body?”

Chu Feng entered deep contemplation.

He recalled that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had also mentioned something similar to him.

He had mentioned that there was a formation in his body.

Merely, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted did not explain things clearly.

Chu Feng had pondered this back then, and came to the conclusion that if there were any sort of formation in his body, it would most likely have been placed there by his father. Merely, even now, Chu Feng did not discover any such formation.

That said, he felt that if there were really such a formation in his body, it was most likely there to protect him.

It was just that Chu Feng could not confirm if such a formation really existed in his body.

“Although that cultivation treasure has died, these things seemed useful.”

Chu Feng’s gaze turned to the battlefield between the cultivation treasure and his nine enormous lightning beasts.

Countless lightning bolts were drifting at that place.

They were shattered like fragments.

Yet, they still contained a considerable amount of power within them. They even contained martial comprehension.

Chu Feng felt that if he were able to refine that lightning, he might be able to make a breakthrough in his cultivation.

That said, even though those bits of lightning were now fragments of their former selves, they still possessed formidable offensive powers.

It would most definitely not be an easy task to refine them.

One must take one’s time in the refinement process.

“Mn? What’s that?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

He discovered that it was not only lightning fragments scattered all over that place. There was also a body of light.

Merely, that body of light was extremely small, over ten times smaller than an ordinary pearl.

Although the lightning was merely fragments, the smallest among them were tens of meters in length. As for the largest among them, it measured many kilometers.

There were an innumerable amount of lightning fragments like that.

That said, those fragments could be placed together and form a vast expanse of lightning.

It was not an easy task to discover such a feeble body of light from among the lightning, and the flickering rays of light they caused.

It was because Chu Feng possessed strong perception. If someone else were in his shoes, they might really not be able to discover that body of light. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

With a single thought from Chu Feng, he appeared before that body of light.

Even though he was not unequalled in his dantian world, it remained that the dantian this world resided in was located in his body.

Because of that, he was able to examine everything in this world should he intend to do so.

Chu Feng arrived before that body of light and began to examine it carefully.

Only after doing so did Chu Feng discover that the body of light possessed a different sort of treasure.

It was completely golden. From a glance, it did not appear to be special at all, but if one were to examine it carefully, one would discover that the power contained within it was no small matter at all.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng’s perception was limited. That body of light had a layer of protection around it.

With the interference of that protective power, Chu Feng was only able to discover that there was a vast amount of power within that body of light, but he was unable to learn the details of things.

That said, what brought Chu Feng the greatest amount of joy was the fact that the little girl’s aura was actually present in the golden body of light.

“Could it be that this is the true form of that cultivation treasure?”

“Could it be that it was forcibly returned to its original state after its body was destroyed?”

“If that’s the case, wouldn’t it mean that I would’ve profited enormously?”

Chu Feng was wild with joy. Even though that body of light was even more difficult to handle than those lightning fragments, it contained power that the lightning fragments could not be compared to.

If Chu Feng was able to refine that body of light, he would obtain an enormous harvest.

He sighed. “It’s truly a pity that the current me is much too weak.”

After feeling joyous, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the incomparably divine Sacred Tree Seed erected within his dantian. A look of helplessness filled his gaze.

Ignoring that golden body of light and the Sacred Tree Seed, those lightning fragments were also cultivation resources.

Yet, even though all of them were already Chu Feng’s possessions, he was unable to refine their power on his own due to his lack of strength.

“Chu Feng, are you alright?”

“Young hero Chu Feng, are you alright?”

Suddenly, countless voices entered Chu Feng’s ears at the same time.

Chu Feng could tell that they belonged to Li Mengyue and others.

Because of that, he immediately separated his consciousness from his dantian world and returned to his body.

It was only at this moment that he discovered Li Mengyue and the others had surrounded him. They were all looking at him with complicated gazes.

That said, Chu Feng did not bother to pay any attention to them.

The reason for that was because he was surprised to discover that this region had changed enormously again.

In the sky above and on the ground below, countless cracks were appearing and spreading rapidly.

Most unhinged of all, no other living being apart from them could be seen in this Purple Star Variance Realm world. All the Purple Star Variance Beasts and all the living creatures had disappeared.

Both his experience and intuition were telling Chu Feng one thing -- this so-called Purple Star Variance Realm was about to collapse.
