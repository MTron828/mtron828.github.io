Chapter 4376: Display of Martial Power

Despite knowing their intentions, Chu Feng didn’t quickly rush forward to nab them. Instead, he simply followed them slowly.

His actions resembled that of a cat toying with a mouse before finally capturing it.

It was as if this was the only way he could dispel the heavy grudge that was in his heart.

It was just a pity that Li Rui and the others had no idea what Chu Feng was thinking of, especially since they had no idea just what kind of trump cards he had in his possession right now.

With their frantic escape, they finally arrived at the valley safely.

As soon as they entered the valley, Ma Chengying and the others looked as if they have just been released from a huge burden, and they heaved a deep sigh of relief.

“We’re finally safe. He won’t be able to do anything to us here.”

“Darn it! How is it that Chu Feng’s world spiritist techniques are so powerful that not even Senior Li is a match for him?”

“To think that there would be world spiritists in the world who could match a cultivator in terms of fighting prowess... That fellow is really a demon!”

“Well, it’s fortunate that while he possesses strong spirit power, his movement speed is exceptionally slow. He couldn’t keep up with Senior Li at all.”

“Hahaha, now that we’re all in here, I reckon that he wouldn’t dare to come in anymore. After all, his spirit power will be sealed in here. No matter how formidable of a world spiritist he is, he won’t dare to enter this valley again!”

Ma Chengying and the others felt as if they had just escaped from the lair of a tiger, and there were visible looks of relief on their faces.

“Who says that I dare not come in here?”

But all of a sudden, Chu Feng’s voice sounded in the air.

Turning their eyes in the direction where the voice had come from, Ma Chengying and the others saw that Chu Feng was already standing right at the entrance of the valley.

Despite so, he still continued to advance forward, taking one step after another toward Ma Chengying and the others.

“Ma Chengying, what’s going on? Didn’t you say that he wouldn’t dare to enter this valley?” Li Rui asked in panic.

He hadn’t witnessed the pitiful plight Chu Feng was reduced to in this valley, so he could only take the words of Ma Chengying and the others for it. If they hadn’t been lying to him, given that Chu Feng had nearly lost his life here, he shouldn’t have dared to step into this valley again.

But that was not the case at all!

The divergence between expectations and reality caused Li Rui to fall into a fluster.

If this valley was ineffective in curbing Chu Feng too, all of them could very well die here!

“The power in this valley is definitely able to restrain his spirit power. We witnessed this with our own eyes earlier! It’s just that I didn’t think that he would be so foolish as to put up a tough front here...

“Since he’s courting death, let’s fulfill his wish then! Senior Li, leave it to me to handle him!”

A furious howl echoed from behind—Ma Chengying.

Ma Chengying whipped out an Incomplete Exalted Armament from his Cosmos Sack and hacked it down on Chu Feng furiously.

His martial power morphed into the form of a massive ferocious beast that charged right toward Chu Feng with terrifying momentum.

It was also a rank four Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

While its prowess was nowhere on par with that of Li Rui’s, it was still a force not to be underestimated.

Previously, Chu Feng had slyly escaped from Ma Chengying’s grasp in this valley, so Ma Chengying was determined to go all out from the start this time around so that Chu Feng wouldn’t get a chance to flee at all.

With this move, he would slay Chu Feng once and for all and rid themselves of a nightmare!

Boom!

However, when this Exalted Taboo Martial Skill was just about to reach Chu Feng, it suddenly dissipated into the surroundings.

It had been blocked by some force.

Astonished, Ma Chengying and the others took a closer look at Chu Feng before their faces turned pale in fright.

Chu Feng had undergone a massive transformation.

A Lightning Mark with the character ‘Divine’ had appeared on his forehead, and he was wearing armor shrouded in crackling lightning streaks.

It should have been impossible for an Utmost Exalted level cultivator to manifest the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor simultaneously, but it was really happening right before their eyes.

And what left them even more frightened was that Chu Feng’s cultivation had undergone a huge change as well.

After the Divine Character Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor appeared, Chu Feng’s cultivation surged all the way to rank six Utmost Exalted level.

It was due to the growth in his cultivation that he was able to block Ma Chengying’s attack so easily.

“You... How did you... Why did your cultivation...”

Ma Chengying and the others were really scared silly. Their mouths kept twitching uncontrollably as they looked upon this situation with dilated pupils filled with fear and disbelief.

Chu Feng was displaying means that even the most talented prodigies they knew of were incapable of pulling off.

But if he possessed such means right from the start, why didn’t he use them then? How did he end up getting tortured and humiliated by Ma Chengying and the others?

It was due to their inability to make sense out of this that they weren’t able to come to terms with the situation.

“What’s going on? Didn’t you say that his cultivation is extremely weak?”

An indignant howl directed toward Ma Chengying and the others suddenly echoed from behind, and it was coming from no other than Li Rui.

“Are you frightened?” Chu Feng asked as he gazed down at Li Rui with a smile.

However, what surprised Chu Feng was that Li Rui would actually harrumph coldly and say, “Frightened? Hmph, you are kidding me! I wouldn’t expect anything less than this! Your world spiritist techniques are indeed formidable, and I admit that I’m not a match for you in that field. But when it comes to martial power, you don’t scare me at all!”

Chu Feng’s ability to bring out both the Divine Character Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor simultaneously was frightening, such that Li Rui would be lying if he said that he wasn’t intimidated, but in the end, Chu Feng’s cultivation was still only at the same level as him, rank six Utmost Exalted level.

Li Rui didn’t think that he would lose to an opponent of the same cultivation level as him.

When Li Rui put on a strong front, Ma Chengying and the others, who were scared witless a moment ago, finally calmed down a little.

Indeed.

Chu Feng’s world spiritist techniques might be formidable, but when it came to martial power, Li Rui stood a good chance too.

After all, they were well aware of just how powerful Li Rui was. The latter hadn’t lost to a cultivator of the same tier before.

His fighting prowess was not to be underestimated!

Klang!

Li Rui swung the sword in his hand lightly, and his aura began to grow swiftly.

This wasn’t just the power of his Incomplete Exalted Armament only. There was something else mixed into it—forbidden medicine.

He had secretly swallowed a forbidden medicine without anyone knowing, and it was with this that he dared to stand against Chu Feng.

A violet mist loomed around his body, and his aura grew much sharper and malicious. The killing intent he emanated made him seem like a demon that had crawled out of the gates of hell.

Seeing the state that Li Rui was in brought back the morale of Ma Chengying and the others.

They felt incredibly glad that Li Rui was their ally at the moment, or else they would surely be panicking all around at the moment. To be honest, Li Rui’s current state was a little scary to them too.

However, what was surprising to them was that even though Li Rui’s strength had grown to a frightening level, infinitesimally nearing that of rank seven Utmost Exalted level, but Chu Feng showed no signs of fear at all. Instead, his lips even inched upward haughtily.

Weng!

In the next instant, light began shrouding Chu Feng’s body before the air suddenly shuddered. The silhouette of a massive beast vaguely appeared behind his back as a powerful and divine aura flowed out from his body. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At the same time, Chu Feng’s cultivation began to rise once more.

From rank six Utmost Exalted level, his strength rose to that of a rank seven Utmost Exalted level cultivator!
