Chapter 4396: The Unfathomable Treasure

A light breeze suddenly whisked across the faces of those present. There was a slight moment of daze on everyone’s faces before they heaved a sigh of relief.

The tension that had strung up inside them finally alleviated at this moment.

Before they knew, the Lady of Dao Sea and the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea had all departed from the area. They left without saying a word at all.

Despite so, no one thought that they were being discourteous. This was simply how the Lady of Dao Sea usually acted.

As one of the hermits of the cultivation world, she didn’t need to fawn on anyone. On the contrary, it was people in the cultivation world who were desperate to fawn on her.

The Soaring Flower Gazebo was only one of them though it was also one of the rare few which managed to win the Lady of Dao Sea’s trust.

However, looking at how things turned out in the end, it might not have been a blessing for them.

There was no way someone of the standing of the Lady of Dao Sea would allow anyone who had deceived her to continue existing on the face of the world.

She was not a righteous person. She wouldn’t go all out to uphold justice and eliminate the countless demonic cults in the world.

However, she also wasn’t an unscrupulous person. She wouldn’t permit anyone of questionable principles around her, and she wouldn’t permit any hypocrites to deceive her either.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you really are an incredible person. To think that you would dare to stand against the Soaring Flower Gazebo to uphold the justice in your heart...”

“The youths nowadays sure are remarkable!”

“May I know who your master is?”

As soon as the Lady of Dao Sea took her leave, the crowd, which was still criticizing Chu Feng a moment ago, changed their faces, and many of them began complimenting Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng had no interest in acquainting himself with such people.

He first thanked Ordinary for his help and bade Liu Shangwu farewell before pretending to leave the area. However, once he was certain that he was out of everyone’s sight, he quickly turned around and returned to the city.

He was heading to the lakeside where he met that mysterious expert earlier on.

He had already obtained the treasure that was requested of him, but that mysterious expert hadn’t contacted him since then.

Chu Feng didn’t have the luxury of time to wait, especially since the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s life was at stake here. So, even though the mysterious expert had said that they would contact him, he still chose to take the initiative to head over to the lakeside.

And to Chu Feng’s relief, the mysterious expert was indeed waiting there for him.

“Elder, I have acquired the item you need,” Chu Feng said as he passed the treasure he had received from the Sagacious Grandmaster over to the mysterious expert.

The mysterious expert accepted the treasure before passing a scroll to Chu Feng.

“The item you are seeking is currently resting here. However, I’d advise you not to head over because you aren’t a match for it,” the mysterious expert said.

Chu Feng unrolled the scroll and realized that it was a map.

As it turned out, there was a hidden world beneath this city. The black streak was currently hiding there.

Chu Feng was still intending to ask the mysterious expert more about the black streak, but when he raised his head once more, he realized that the mysterious expert had already left the area.

“Didn’t he leave a little too quickly? Elder, are you still there? Elder, you said that you were going to protect me, so why didn’t you appear? I was nearly killed by those scoundrels of the Soaring Flower Gazebo!”

Chu Feng asked a few questions one after another, but he didn’t receive any response at all.

While he was a little unhappy that the mysterious expert had left him be during a critical moment, he didn’t pay too much heed to it since it was already over, and he was still alive and kicking anyway.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk and held it tightly in his hands.

“Looks like I can only count on you now...” Chu Feng said to the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk in his grasp.

He knew that there was no way he would stand a chance against the black streak using his own strength, so he could only rely on the power of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk to help him.

The Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk wasn’t a very reliable tool since, just like the divine deer, it only worked from time to time. It was a power that he couldn’t control, and it was really leaving his fate to luck.

Nevertheless, this was still the best shot he had.

Weng!

But to Chu Feng’s delight, when he tried to activate the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, it immediately began reacting this time around.

“This is weird. Why does it ignore me earlier only to help me now? Does it mean that it’ll only help me capture that black streak?”

Chu Feng was a little perplexed by the situation, but he still immediately got to action anyway.

The hidden world beneath the city was not that easy to find. Fortunately to Chu Feng, the mysterious expert had indicated the way to enter the hidden world on the map.

And the passageway was actually the lake right before him.

Chu Feng leaped into the lake and dived all the way down, and soon, he found himself before the entrance to the hidden world.

Without any hesitation, he entered the hidden world, and in the next moment, he found himself standing around a twilight world that wasn’t too big in size. The area was completely barren.

It wouldn’t be easy to find the black streak in here.

Luckily for Chu Feng, the tracking compass was finally working properly again, pointing out a clear direction for him.

Chu Feng quickly concealed his aura with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and the power of the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk before he began following the direction pointed out by the tracking compass.

Soon, he arrived before his target.

But this time, the black flame shrouding the black streak was far more powerful than before. The black flame pierced deep into the underground and rose up to the clouds, making it seem like a massive beast that was swallowing the world.

Before it, Chu Feng felt insignificantly small.

The black streak was completely still at the moment, seemingly in the midst of accomplishing something. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

To be honest, Chu Feng had no idea whether the formation that was imparted to him by the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk would still work against it or not, but he had no other choice at the moment.

He began to set up the same formation with the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk at its core.

He was initially very iffy about this matter, but the more he constructed the formation, the more assured he became.

He realized that the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk had grown correspondingly stronger as well. The formation he was setting up at this very moment was visibly stronger than before.

However, his spirit power hadn’t gone through any advancements at all, and he was setting up the formation in the exact same way too.

The fact that the formation became stronger only meant that the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk was providing him with greater power than before.

Watching the blood-red smoke shrouding the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, Chu Feng muttered in astonishment, “Does this mean that you didn’t go all out the previous time around?”

This was the first time he had realized that the power of real treasures could be unfathomable too.
