Chapter 5515: This Fellow Is Out of the World

Feng Jiuyue and the others were surprised to see Chu Feng too, but their target wasn’t him but the formation he had just completed. They must have known that their clansmen were there too.

They were probably planning to investigate the formation since it showed not the silhouette of their clan, the Totem Dragon Clan, or the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, but red lightning. They must have felt compelled to look into the terrifying red lightning.

It didn’t take long for Chu Feng to cross paths with Feng Jiuyue and the others. As expected, they had chosen to bump into him.

“Wait a moment,” Feng Jiuyue suddenly halted and called out to Chu Feng.

“Is there an issue?” Chu Feng stopped as well and replied.

Shoosh!

Feng Jiuyue tossed a box to Chu Feng with a wave of her sleeves before resuming her journey toward the formation.

“Big sister, you…” Feng Tiansheng glanced at the box in Chu Feng’s hand and exclaimed in indignance, but he eventually chose to keep his mouth shut and instead followed his big sister.

Chu Feng first examined the box to check if it was booby-trapped before carefully opening it. To his surprise, there was an invaluable golden recovery pill in it. In terms of effectiveness, it didn’t pale in comparison to the one he had received from the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had only given him such a valuable pill because he had helped the Totem Dragon Clan on multiple occasions and was relying on him to do the same time too, but the same couldn’t be said about Feng Jiuyue…

There was no camaraderie between him and the Totem Phoenix Clan, not to mention that he had even fleeced them in the Demon Crane. In fact, he had even killed some of their clansmen too, though the Totem Phoenix Clan was unaware of it.

It would have made perfect sense for the Totem Phoenix Clansmen to view him in hostility. There was only one reason Feng Jiuyue had given such a valuable pill to him.

“Feng Jiuyue has a good eye. She knows that it’s wiser to befriend you, so she gave you a valuable pill upon seeing that you’re injured. It looks like the Totem Phoenix Clan isn’t all fools,” Eggy said.

That was exactly what Chu Feng was thinking too.

“That’s a good thing. It’s better to have one more friend than one more enemy,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He stowed away the box and continued on his journey.

He was looking for Long Chengyu and Long Muxi, but they were nowhere to be seen when he arrived at the next formation. There were some Totem Dragon Clansmen here though, including several familiar faces such as Long Xu’s granddaughter, Long Zhizhi, and the daughter of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Long Yuhong.

With Long Zhizhi and Long Yuhong’s strength, this group was indubitably another one of the Totem Dragon Clan’s elite forces.

There was also another group from the Totem Phoenix Clan here, and they were fairly strong too. All of them were standing inside the formation core, doing everything they could to infuse their auras into the formation core to complete the formation.

These two forces were much stronger than those stationed at the previous formation, and they most definitely possessed the means to complete it by themselves. The important thing for them was to ensure that the formation came under their control.

They were so absorbed in it that they didn’t notice Chu Feng’s arrival.

“Do you need help?” Chu Feng walked into the formation core and asked.

It was only then that Long Zhizhi and Long Yuhong noticed Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you’re here too? That’s wonderful!” Long Zhizhi exclaimed with a blossoming smile.

Long Yuhong didn’t say a word, but it was clear from her eyes that she was delighted to see Chu Feng here too. It was just that her response wasn’t as pronounced as Long Zhizhi’s.

“I’ll help you complete this formation,” Chu Feng got straight to the point.

“Chu Feng, that formation might be…” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Long Zhizhi wanted to explain to him that there were restrictions on this formation, but Chu Feng pointed to the red lightning formation behind him.

“I did that.”

Long Zhizhi’s lower jaws fell slack, whereas Long Yuhong’s eyes widened in shock.

“You were the one who completed that formation? Chu Feng… you possess a monstrous beast bloodline too?” Long Zhizhi asked as she walked out of the formation core.

“I don’t, but I do have the means to complete the formation,” Chu Feng replied.

“Get out, everyone,” Long Yuhong ordered as she left the formation too.

Even though they were at a critical phase of their competition, the Totem Dragon Clansmen still immediately heeded her orders and evacuated from the formation core. Of course, it was not just solely on the account of her standing but that they knew about Chu Feng’s capabilities too.

“I advise the lot of you to get out too, or else you’ll be evicted from the formation once I’m done,” Chu Feng told the Totem Phoenix Clansmen.

“Hmph!” The Totem Phoenix Clansmen harrumphed in disdain, not paying any heed to him.

However, they intensified the release of their aura into the formation.

The formation was already on the verge of completion, just that both sides were vying over its control rights. It was a rare opportunity for them to emerge victorious now that the fools from the Totem Dragon Clansmen had left on their own accord, so there was no way they could back down at this juncture.

“Since that’s the case, you shouldn’t blame me for what’s about to come,” Chu Feng murmured as he released his aura.

The crowd knew right away that Chu Feng wasn’t lying, for the aura he released was crackling with red lightning identical to the formation that had just been completed. Most important of all, the red lightning he was releasing was so powerful that it swiftly devoured the Totem Phoenix Clan’s auras.

“Damn it!”

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen panicked. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before Chu Feng took control of this formation. However, they were already exerting their full strength, so there was nothing else they could do despite their anxiety.

In contrast, the Totem Dragon Clansmen could hardly conceal their smiles.

“That’s weird. Shouldn’t young hero Chu Feng’s bloodline have nine-colored lightning? Why is there only one color?” Someone from the Totem Dragon Clan expressed their confusion.

They didn’t immediately associate the red lightning formation with Chu Feng because they knew that he possessed the Heavenly Bloodline, which was usually symbolized by the nine-colored lightning. Yet, there was only red lightning inside the formation.

Furthermore, the red lightning harnessed frighteningly destructive prowess, exerting pressure that was even greater than their Totem Dragon Clan’s bloodline.

“Chu Feng’s means have always been beyond our imagination, but what’s important here is that we’re going to win the battle,” Long Zhizhi said.

Her smile was so wide that she could hardly stop her lips from curling upward even while she was speaking. Unlike the others, who were concerned about the anomaly regarding Chu Feng’s bloodline, her eyes were only focused on Chu Feng.

Long Yuhong rolled her eyes.

She still remembered how Long Zhizhi had treated Chu Feng back at the Totem Dragon Clan’s Armory Hall; the latter had insulted Chu Feng just because he had spared a glance at the Silver Dragon Spear. It was so vile and unreasonable that even she felt inclined to step in and stop her. Even so, Long Zhizhi didn’t back down at all and instead directed her malice toward her.

Yet, it was clear even to Long Yuhong, who had never been in a relationship before, that Long Zhizhi harbored special feelings for Chu Feng. No one could have imagined that a day would come when Long Zhizhi, Lord Long Xu’s granddaughter and one of the top prodigies of their Totem Dragon Clan, would become a fangirl of an outsider.

However, when Long Yuhong looked at how Chu Feng single-handedly took control of the situation and turned the tables on the Totem Phoenix Clansmen, leaving them anxious and powerless, she could understand why Long Zhizhi felt that way.

She also understood why Long Chengyu and Long Muxi would befriend Chu Feng and be so protective of him. That man was so ridiculously powerful that it defied common sense.

“That man is out of this world,” Long Yuhong thought.
