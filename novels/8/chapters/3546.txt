Chapter 3546 - Inside The Starfall Holy Stone

The opening of the Void Sacred Tree this time around was no small matter. After all, it was a sight described in the legends.

The Starfall Holy Land, unwilling to miss out on such an opportunity, had practically dispatched all of their top experts.

Not to mention the Starfall Eight Immortals, even the Starfall Holy Land’s thirteen Supreme Elders had all been dispatched.

One should know that many of the Starfall Holy Land’s Supreme Elders would be in closed-door training year-round. Thus, they were forcibly summoned so that they could partake in the rare opportunity.

After all, even the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master, someone who was also in closed-door training, immediately exited his closed-door training upon learning of the news. It was also their Holy Master’s decision to dispatch all of their peak experts. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Naturally, those Supreme Elders would not dare to go against their Holy Master’s decision.

Of course, the reason why all those peak experts were dispatched to the Void Sacred Tree was because they all wanted to seize the opportunity and make breakthroughs in their cultivation.

It was not only the peak experts. The Starfall Holy Land’s younger generations, the ones that have had altercations with Chu Feng before, had also made the journey.

When they arrived at the Void Sacred Tree, the Chu Heavenly Clan as well as the various other powers that were with them had all already entered the Void Sacred Tree.

The people from the Starfall Holy Land also did not encounter the mysterious individual who looked identical to Wang Qiang.

As they had entered the Void Sacred Tree multiple times already, they had some understanding of its structure. Thus, they voluntarily went their separate ways.

That said, the great majority of them decided to follow their Holy Master.

The ones that were able to go their separate ways from their Holy Master were all people who possessed sufficient strength to protect themselves, people like the Starfall Eight Immortals.

The reason why they were so cautious was because the opening of the Void Sacred Tree this time was completely different from the past. Because of that, they did not dare to lower their guard.

In fact, in order to guard against the unexpected, they even took out their Starfall Holy Land’s sect-protection treasure.

That treasure was called the Starfall Holy Stone.

The Starfall Holy Stone came from the Outer World. It could be said to be the foundation that had helped establish the Starfall Holy Land.

The first generation Holy Master of the Starfall Holy Land had borrowed the power of the Starfall Holy Stone to create a defensive treasure.

Later on, through the refinements from successive generations of Holy Masters, the Starfall Holy Stone became a treasure with extremely powerful defensive capabilities.

Most importantly, when the Starfall Holy Stone was activated, it would be able to inform others through its fragments. This sort of notification remained effective even in special locations.

That said, unless forced with no alternative, the Starfall Holy Land wouldn’t be willing to use the Starfall Holy Stone to protect themselves.

The stone that Chu Feng was holding in his hand, was a piece of the Starfall Holy Stone.

Should the Starfall Holy Stone’s fragment flicker with a guiding light, it meant that the Starfall Holy Stone had been activated, and the Starfall Holy Land was very likely in trouble.

That was the reason why the Starfall Eight Immortals were so anxious, and hoped that Chu Feng would accompany them. They wanted to borrow his strength to help them.

Even though they did not know exactly what sort of trouble that Holy Master and the others encountered, it was most definitely not a small thing, since their Holy Master was forced to use the Starfall Holy Stone.

As for the truth, it was also like that...

Deep in the Void Sacred Tree was an enormous region of empty space.

An enormous stone had appeared in the center of that empty space, and was floating in midair amidst the enormous tree branches.

That stone was simply enormous. It seemed like a mountain had appeared at that location.

Furthermore, the stone was very strange, and extremely incompatible with the enormous tree branches that surrounded the Void Sacred Tree. It was as if the stone did not belong there at all.

Outside of the stone stood several hundred black-cloaked individuals. They were all Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

They stood there orderly as they gazed at the floating stone.

They were unable to see through the stone. However, contempt and confidence filled their gazes. It was as if everything was within their control.

That floating stone was actually the Starfall Holy Land’s treasure, the Starfall Holy Stone.

Whilst the stone might appear to be an enormous stone, it actually held an isolated space inside it. The elites of the Starfall Holy Land, totaling over ten thousand people, were all inside the space within the stone.

Not only were Xia Yun’er, Song Yunfei and the other younger generations present, there were even eleven of their Supreme Elders present.

The person leading them was a middle-aged man wearing a white gown with a head of long hair and a headdress on his head.

This middle-aged man not only looked very handsome, but he also appeared very imposing. His eyes appeared very dignified. It was a gaze that had gone through years of experience.

His aura was stronger than all the people inside this isolated space. He was the strongest expert of the Starfall Holy Land, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master.

At that moment, this Holy Master had an ugly look on his face. He was also sitting on the ground powerlessly. The eleven Supreme Elders were all around him, and trying their hardest to treat his injuries.

Seeing that the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master had managed to slowly open his eyes, a Supreme Elder hurriedly asked with deep concern, “Holy Master, are you feeling better now?”

“Mn,” the Starfall Holy Master nodded slowly. However, it could be seen that he was still very weak.

“Holy Master, what are we to do? Even you are no match for that guy, are we going to just stay in here forever?” asked that Supreme Elder with a worry filled face.

“What else can we do besides staying in here? Are we to go out and throw our lives away trying to take them down?” Another Supreme Elder rebuked that worried Supreme Elder.

“Lord Holy Master is injured, let us treat his injuries first. After all, with us being in the Starfall Holy Stone, they will not be able to do anything to us,” said another Supreme Elder.

Once that Supreme Elder said that, the other Supreme Elders also nodded in agreement. It could be seen that they were very confident in the defensive capability of the Starfall Holy Stone.

“No, that won’t do,” suddenly, the Holy Master spoke. He said, “I’m afraid that the Starfall Holy Stone will not be able to stop them.”

“Ah?” Hearing those words, the hearts of the eleven Supreme Elders immediately grew tense. Unconcealed panic appeared on their faces.
