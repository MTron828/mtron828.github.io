Chapter 5265: The Goal of the Totem Dragon Clan

“Ah choo!”

Chu Feng suddenly sneezed. He glanced at the massive spirit formation gate floating behind him. Earlier, as the massive tempest swept across the area, he received a message from the formation.

Advance!

Thus, he marched ahead despite the resistance from the tempest. A while later, the tempest suddenly died down. Those who had failed to advance against the tempest formation were sucked into another spirit formation gate, marking their elimination.

With that, there were less than a thousand cultivators left in the tournament, but it would be foolish to underestimate any single one of them.

“Hm?”

As Chu Feng pulled his attention back from the massive spirit formation gate in the sky, he noticed that all of the nearby cultivators were looking at him. He had been too preoccupied with marching forward that, before he knew it, he was already standing at the forefront of the group.

None of these cultivators recognized Chu Feng, which might have been the reason behind the indignance in their eyes.

What right does a nameless nobody have to walk in front of us?

Chu Feng noticed that Mo Yuhan was looking at him with shock in her pink eyes. She hadn’t been surprised in the least when he curbed the others back at the mountain peak, but this incident seemed to have changed her impression of him.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re here too. How wonderful!”

A person suddenly rushed out from the crowd to greet Chu Feng.

“That is…”

The crowd revealed conflicted looks. Chu Feng was a nobody to them, but they recognized the person who had just stepped forward. Even those who had never met him before had at least heard about him.

One of the strongest prodigies of the Totem Galaxy below Half-God level—Tang Xiu.

“Brother Chu Feng… Ah, I should call you young hero Chu Feng instead. Shall we travel together?” Tang Xiu asked with a smile.

He had taken on a completely different attitude as opposed to the first time he met Chu Feng. His previous arrogance had disappeared without a trace, replaced with amicability.

“Sure.”Chu Feng wasn’t the type to remember a grudge either. He was willing to bury the hatchet and travel together with Tang Xiu.

“Tang Xiu, he is…?” another suave white-robed man holding onto a foldable fan stepped forward and asked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Zhou Yan!”

The crowd’s astonishment deepened.

Zhou Yan was also another famed prodigy that was known to be one the strongest beneath Half-God level in Totem Galaxy. In terms of reputation, he didn’t pale in comparison to Tang Xiu at all.

“Zhou Yan, I know that you like to mess around with people, but I advise you not to provoke my Brother Chu Feng,” Tang Xiu said.

“Are you going to stand up for him if I provoke him? When did you find yourself such a close buddy? Why have I never heard about it?” Zhou Yan asked.

“That’s not what I mean, Zhou Yan. You might still stand a chance against me in a duel, but you’re doomed to be defeated if you challenge Brother Chu Feng. I’m saying those words for your own good,” Tang Xiu said.

“Hoh! You’re even bragging on his behalf. Do I look like I’m the kind to succumb to such threats?” Zhou Yan turned to look at Chu Feng with provocative eyes.

Boom!

Teleportation energy suddenly descended from the sky and wrapped around everyone present, including Chu Feng.

“This feeling…?” Chu Feng murmured.

“What’s wrong?” Eggy asked.

“The spirit power is different from before. It carries the aura of the Ancient Era,” Chu Feng said.

“So?” Eggy asked.

“It isn’t a means of the Totem Dragon Clan,” Chu Feng answered.

By then, Chu Feng had already been transported into a passageway. Before long, he was transported into a huge hall.

His eyes immediately narrowed.

The hall was extremely old, suffused with the aura of the Ancient Era. There was a glowing silhouette in front of him. It didn’t have a face, but the outlines suggested it was a woman. She carried the same aura as the hall.

“Is this the goal of the Trial of the Strongest?” Chu Feng thought to himself.

It was likely that the field chosen for the Trial of the Strongest was an ancient remnant that could only be opened using special means. The Totem Dragon Clan had gathered them here to help them breach the ancient remnant.

In other words, the Trial of the Strongest was nothing more than a means to lure them here.

“You are qualified,” the glowing woman suddenly said.

Weng!

The glowing woman’s body suddenly scattered into countless specks of light that surged toward Chu Feng.

Whoosh!

Chu Feng’s body was quickly flooded by the white light, leaving him feeling frustrated and suffocated. The white light covered his entire vision, but what was most frightening of all was that he sensed the threat of death from it. As time passed, the sense of danger only grew bigger.

“Do you want to live?” that woman asked.

“Aren’t you asking the obvious, elder? I didn’t come here to die,” Chu Feng replied with a bitter smile.

“Hold your mind steady if you wish to live. If you fail to compose your mind within an hour’s time, you’ll die here,” the woman said.

Chu Feng quickly did as he was told, but it was easier said than done. The white light was constantly rattling his mind up, making it difficult for him to compose himself. It took him an hour, but he eventually managed to compose his mind.

Whoosh!

The white light trapping Chu Feng scattered, and the glowing woman silhouette appeared before him once more.

“You are… formidable,” the woman said.

Despite her lack of facial features, Chu Feng could sense a subtle change in her gaze.

“Am I? I nearly died,” Chu Feng replied.

“I lied. The time limit is two hours. I only told you that it was an hour in order to stimulate your competitiveness. Your results surprised me,” the woman said.

“You lied?” Chu Feng was rendered speechless.

“Your family will be honored because of you,” the woman said.

A surge of teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng, and he was transported back to the forest. However, the changes in his surroundings indicated that he was deeper into the forest than before.

“What’s going all? Is that all? She should have at least offered a reward or something!” Eggy said.

“We’re being used by the Totem Dragon Clan. We’re nothing more than tools for them to breach this ancient remnant, so the reward naturally won’t fall upon us,” Chu Feng said.

“How despicable!” Eggy cursed.

“It’s only to be expected. There’s no such thing as a free lunch in this world.”

Chu Feng wasn’t too bothered since he was here to claim the title of the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator. He didn’t mind being used for that.

Meanwhile, a huge group of experts from the Totem Dragon Clan was gathered inside an ancient temple beneath the mountain range. Lord Long Zhen was amidst the group, but there were four other cultivators whose auras were on par with him.

These five people were seated around a table with an ancient bronze sphere placed in the middle. This bronze sphere had a mechanism that was split into four portions.

Kacha!

A portion of the mechanism suddenly clicked open.

“One of them opened!”

“Someone cleared the trial that quickly?”

The crowd was overjoyed, but shock filled their faces when they took a closer look.

“It’s the late Martial Exalted level category?”

This was beyond their expectations. They thought that the first one to unlock the sphere should have been either the early Half-God level or late Half-God level category.
