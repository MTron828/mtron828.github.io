Chapter 5814: Immemorial Land of Dao Creation

“Song Luoyi, you’re really alive,” Jia Lingyi exclaimed with a fearful expression.

The other party was the daughter of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect’s sectmaster, Song Luoyi, as well as Chu Feng’s grandmother. Even though the woman before her looked very old, unlike the Song Luoyi in her memories, she was certain the other party was indeed Song Luoyi.

“Were you the one behind this? No, it can’t be you. Who is it? Who is it?!” Jia Lingyi asked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The first emotion she felt upon seeing Chu Feng’s grandmother was fear, but her fear was soon overtaken by rage when she saw the destroyed Pill Dao Immortal Sect around her.

“Someone must have helped you. Chu Feng couldn’t have possibly grown so fast otherwise. He wouldn’t have dared to go against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion too. That explains it... No wonder... Is it the Immortal Sea Fish Clan? The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect? Or the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion?”

Jia Lingyi refused to believe Chu Feng’s grandmother was behind this.

Her Pill Dao Immortal Sect was a sect with tens of thousands of years of history, second only to the galaxy overlords. They had countless powerful world spiritists and cultivators.

There was no way Song Luoyi was a match for the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. In the first place, it was already a miracle for her to still be alive. What were the chances of her becoming strong enough to destroy them?

For that reason, she was convinced that Chu Feng and his grandmother had the backing of a major power. That would explain how Chu Feng grew so fast, overcame countless tribulations, and became close friends with the prodigies of powerhouses.

Shoosh!

All of a sudden, Song Luoyi glanced at Jia Lingyi.

This glance petrified Jia Lingyi. She began trembling, and both her tears and saliva began flowing uncontrollably. It was as if she had been turned into a fool. It was only when Song Luoyi turned away that she slowly regained herself.

Putong!

Jia Lingyi crashed onto the ground. Whatever strength she had mustered from her rage vanished without a trace. She could only lay weakly on the ground and asked with a quivering voice, “How did you become so powerful?”

Song Luoyi didn’t answer the question. She didn’t make a move on Jia Lingyi either. She retracted her gaze and slowly walked away, till she finally vanished in the sea of flames.

Jia Lingyi, with tears streaming down her face, burst into laughter.

“Haha... HAHAHAHA!”

It was a bitter laughter overflowing with despair. That single glance made her realize the vast gap between her and Song Luoyi. Even the elders in her Pill Dao Immortal Sect were no match for her too.

Jia Lingyi realized there was no way she could exact vengeance for this grudge. She could only helplessly accept the fate that had befallen her Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

And this was all caused by her jealousy. A single moment of folly had led to the end of her and her sect!

...

Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the others were meditating in the sky.

They couldn’t stop meditating halfway through once they began, so there was practically no interaction among them. It was only when the runes dissipated that all of them simultaneously opened their eyes.

“H-h-how did your meditation go?” Wang Qiang stood up and asked with an excited expression.

Feng Ling rolled her eyes upon seeing Wang Qiang’s clothes. She turned to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, can you tell your brother to wear some clothes? It’s stinging my eyes.”

Wang Qiang’s flower pants were exceptionally jarring when he was the only one standing.

“M-m-miss, you clearly don’t understand beauty. Don’t you think m-m-my well-built muscles look good?” Wang Qiang raised his arm and purposely flaunted his not-so-conspicuous muscles.

“If not for Brother Chu Feng, I would have long smacked you to death!” Feng Ling eyed him from head to toe in contempt.

Wang Qiang wasn’t angered by Feng Ling’s words. Instead, he broke out in a mischievous grin and said, “Miss, why are you taking advantage of me?”

Feng Ling responded with a puking expression.

“All right, let’s focus on the main business at hand. Are you finished comprehending the runes?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m done, but I don’t know if you have grasped the same thing as me. What I learned was a way to channel my bloodline power to construct a house,” Long Chengyu said.

“It’s the same for me too,” Qin Xuan said.

“It seems like we have all grasped the same thing,” Ling Xiao said before glancing at Chu Feng.

The others turned to Chu Feng too. They were curious to know if Chu Feng had grasped the same thing, as it wouldn’t have been surprising for someone of his talent to have comprehended something else instead.

Chu Feng understood what Ling Xiao was getting at from his gaze and replied with a smile, “It’s the same for me too.”

“That’s good.”

The crowd revealed satisfied smiles. It was good news they had comprehended the same thing as Chu Feng.

Boom!

Just then, the area they were in began to rumble.

“It’s coming from above.”

The crowd looked up, as they sensed a surge of energy falling from above. The surge of energy exerted tremendous pressure on them, causing them to plummet from the sky.

Chu Feng was the first one to regain his balance, followed by Wang Qiang, Little Fishy, Yuwen Yanri, and Xianhai Shaoyu. Eventually, Xian Miaomiao, Feng Ling, and the others regained their balance too.

Even though they didn’t fall further down, they had to shoulder immense pressure just to stand their ground. It wouldn’t be easy for them to ascend back to where they were.

What’s going on?

Chu Feng and the others looked upward.

From where the surge of energy had come from, they saw a golden light that emanated an air of divinity as if it was from heaven. As the golden light shimmered, they saw countless silhouettes in it, and every single one of these silhouettes gave off an incomparably powerful aura.

“My gosh. Am I seeing things?” Qin Xuan, despite looking to be in pain a moment ago, broke out in a delighted smile. He turned to Chu Feng, Xianhai Shaoyu, Ling Xiao, and the others and exclaimed, “Chu Feng, Brother Shaoyu, Ling Xiao, am I seeing things? This is the legendary Immemorial Land of Dao Creation, right?”

Xianhai Shaoyu was much more composed than Qin Xuan, but his eyes were overflowing with anticipation.
