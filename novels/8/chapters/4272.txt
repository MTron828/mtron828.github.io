Chapter 4272 - Chu Feng’s Confusion

“Milord, please spare us, please spare us.”

All sorts of begging voices sounded nonstop. Those that were more cowardly kneeled onto the ground and began to kowtow to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Some even turned to beg for forgiveness from Chu Feng. They hoped that Chu Feng would plea for leniency for them.

For the sake of surviving, they were trying all sorts of methods and disregarding all their dignity.

They were simply too scared.

Although this Ox-nosed Old Daoist had a wretched appearance and was smiling the entire time, he was a truly ruthless fellow.

Even people like the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo were killed by him without any hesitation.

They, lowly as they are, would simply be killed with a single thought from him.

“A bunch of cowardly scoundrels.”

Seeing the hundreds of millions of people crying and begging for forgiveness, a smile on the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s face turned mocking.

Someone like him had already seen through the matters of life. He had witnessed scenes like this multiple times now.

What this world lacked the least were people that bullies the weak but fears the strong.

They were also the sort of people that he would show the least amount of sympathy for.

Thus, as he spoke, he waved his sleeve.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh---”

Crimson lights flew out from his sleeve like a torrential rain and shot straight toward the crowd present.

“Eeeahhh----”

The next moment, screams began to sound from the hundreds of millions of people present.

Turned out, the crimson lights had penetrated those people’s bodies. Apart from the people that didn’t curse out Chu Feng, all the rest of them, without exception, were struck by the crimson light.

Once the light entered them, they turned into poison and began to torture them.

“Who would’ve expected that my master is actually this ruthless of a person.”

Hearing the nonstop screams from the vast crowd and seeing how they had all fallen to the ground and were rolling about like maggots, Chu Feng couldn’t help but gasp in admiration at how ruthless the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was.

But, Chu Feng did not feel any sort of disgust with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s ruthlessness. On the contrary, he was very fond of the way the Ox-nosed Old Daoist does things.

“Woosh---”

Suddenly, a figure landed beside Chu Feng. This person was none other than the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Ox-nose, haven’t you gone a little too far?”

Although that was what Grandmaster Tang Chen was saying, he had a smile on his face.

It could be seen that he actually also approved of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s way of handling things.

Furthermore, he felt that it was very refreshing. After all, the way those people behaved earlier was truly repulsive.

“Too far?”

“I’m already being merciful by letting them live,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What senior said is extremely correct. Those people do need to be taught a lesson.”

“Senior, I am Wang Muzhi.”

“May I know of senior’s distinguished name?”

Even Celestial Fairy Muzhi took the initiative to step forward and bow to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

It was truly rare to see her acting this serious.

“Celestial Fairy Muzhi, you’re slightly older than me. Thus, you shouldn’t address me as senior. You can address me as Ox-nose.”

“That’s what all the people that know me address me as,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Ox-nose? This... is a bit too disrespectful, no?” said Celestial Fairy Muzhi.

“You don’t have to worry about it. Just address him as such. He likes to be addressed like that,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen with a smile.

“In that case, I shall humbly accept,” Celestial Fairy Muzhi responded very courteously.

The reason why she was acting in such a manner was because of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s strength.

Rank two Martial Exalted level cultivation and a rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation level world spirit techniques.

Celestial Fairy Muzhi felt that while the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s world spirit techniques might not be able to match the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, his cultivation had evidently surpassed the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

Even she does not dare to show disrespect toward an existence like that.

“Everyone, if you want to chat, please wait a moment.”

“I need to first discuss something with my beloved disciple.”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he waved his sleeve.

A spirit formation appeared.

It was an isolation-type of spirit formation.

That spirit formation teleported Grandmaster Tang Chen, Celestial Fairy Muzhi, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting out.

At this moment, only Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were inside the spirit formation.

Of course, that stele was in there too.

As this was an isolation formation, one cannot hear the bitter screams of the crowd outside. At the same time, the people outside were unable to see Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and unable to hear their conversation.

“Brat, weren’t you unwilling to become this old man’s disciple? Why did you suddenly change your mind? Is it because you want to obtain this inheritance?”

Ox-nosed Old Daoist took a glance at the stele before asking Chu Feng.

“It is true that this junior wanted to obtain this inheritance.”

“But, it is most definitely not because I wanted to obtain this inheritance that I decided to take senior as my master.”

“After all, if I wanted to obtain this inheritance, I could find anyone to be my master. Furthermore, I can refuse to admit the master-disciple relationship after obtaining the inheritance,” said Chu Feng.

“Tell me why you insist on taking me as your master then,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Senior had helped me fuse with my Divine Power. That grace was akin to a master’s passing on their abilities to one’s disciple.”

“Senior’s assistance to me was akin to the grace a master shows upon one’s disciple.”

“The reason why this junior was unwilling to take senior as my master back then was because I had vowed to not take anyone as my master.”

“The reason why this junior refused senior was because I didn’t want to go against my own oath,” said Chu Feng.

“Kid, is there something wrong with you? Why would you make that sort of pledge?” asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“The reason why I made that pledge was because I was courting trouble all over. I didn’t want to implicate people close to me.”

“But, thinking about it carefully, I realized that senior was different from others. Senior’s abilities are exceptionally powerful. Even if I ended up implicating senior, senior wouldn’t be afraid,” said Chu Feng.

“Kid, you’re quite an oily-mouthed smooth-talker. Where did you learn that from? Your father was not like you.”

“Oh, it must be from your mother,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Senior, you’ve met my mother before?” asked Chu Feng.

“I haven’t,” Ox-nosed Old Daoist shook his head.

Chu Feng felt disappointed after hearing those words. But soon, he asked, “Senior, you should know my father well, right?”

“The familiarity between your father and I cannot match that of you and I. After all, you’re my disciple now.”

“If you’re curious about your father, go and ask him about it later. Don’t come and ask me. This old man knows nothing.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist seemed to know what Chu Feng was thinking and decided to dispel Chu Feng’s desire to make inquiries about his father.

Seeing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist acting like this, Chu Feng curled his lips and muttered, “Senior, you were the one who told me before that you possess an exceptional relationship with my father. Why are you saying that you’re unfamiliar with my father now?”

“How could you believe in everything this old man says?”

“Everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield knew that my words cannot be trusted. You’re the only one who trusted my words.”

“Oh, that’s right. Why are you still addressing me as senior? Do you not want that inheritance?”

“Quickly, call me master,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Chu Feng pays his respect to Lord Esteemed Master,” Chu Feng said half-heartedly.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not angered by that. Instead, he was unable to conceal his happiness. From the way he looked, it seemed like he would be very happy as long as Chu Feng addressed him as master.

“Master, this disciple has one thing that I’m confused by,” said Chu Feng all of a sudden.

“What are you confused by? Ask away. We’re master and disciple here, there’s no need to beat around the bush,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Master, since you’ve revealed your strength, why are you still putting on a disguise? Why not reveal who you are?” asked Chu Feng.

The reason why he asked that was because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was still taking on the identity of Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Even when facing Celestial Fairy Muzhi, he did not reveal the fact that he was Zhuge Yuankong.

This meant that he, at least for now, still wanted to continue on with the identity of Ox-nosed Old Daoist in the Holy Light Galaxy.

At least for now, he didn’t want to reveal that he was Zhuge Yuankong.

But, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was no longer weaker than the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

At a time like this, he shouldn’t be acting in such a manner. Instead, he should be revealing his true identity and disclose the truth of what happened back then before seeking revenge from the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.
