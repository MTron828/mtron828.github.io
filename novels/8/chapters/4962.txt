Chapter 4962: Rank Seven Dragon Transformation Sensation

“Young friend Chu Feng, you mustn’t mess around! Didn’t you promise me to heed my instructions regarding this? You’ll hurt them if you start messing around!” Master Yin Ren exclaimed in agitation.

“Master Yin Ren, Miaomiao and Princess Xiaoxiao are my friends. I’m more concerned about their safety than you. That’s why I hope that you’ll allow me to use my own method to save Miaomiao.”

Chu Feng continued to construct the formation as he spoke, choosing to disregard Master Yin Ren’s orders.&nbsp;

Weng!

There was a sudden surge of soul energy, and a silhouette appeared before Chu Feng. It was none other than Master Yin Ren.

“Master Yin Ren, you’re able to enter this place with your soul too?” Chu Feng asked with a surprised tone, though the truth was that he had already anticipated this.&nbsp;

“I have to face a great deal of pressure in order to enter this place. Not only will I be in danger, but Princess Xiaoxiao and Princess Miaomiao’s life will be endangered as well. Unless desperate, I wouldn’t have resorted to this measure,” Master Yin Ren said.&nbsp;

In other words, he had only entered this place because Chu Feng refused to heed his instructions.&nbsp;

Chu Feng could sense that Master Yin Ren’s soul energy was much weaker upon entering this place. It appeared that his powers were suppressed even more severely than Chu Feng’s.

“Young friend Chu Feng, why are you acting wilfully? You have already succeeded in constructing the formation I have imparted to you. You will be able to save Princess Miaomiao by listening to my guidance. I can’t understand why you are doing this,” Master Yin Ren questioned Chu Feng.

Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng posed one of his own, “Master Yin Ren, I’m rather surprised that you’re suppressed by the formation you have constructed yourself.”

“This has nothing to do with who constructed the formation but the nature of the formation itself. Even I am subjected to the rules of this formation,” Master Yin Ren said.

“I see…”

Chu Feng nodded comprehendingly when the look in his eyes suddenly changed.&nbsp;

“What are you planning, Master Yin Ren?” he asked.&nbsp;

“Ah? What are you talking about, young friend Chu Feng?”&nbsp;

Master Yin Ren appeared confused.

“Master Yin Ren, do you take me for a fool? The formation you have imparted to me is indeed a counter formation, but have you forgotten that I’m a world spiritist too?&nbsp;

“I can tell that it’s a binding formation disguised as a counter formation. It’s in a dormant state at the moment, but it’ll immediately activate if I link it to the formation binding Miaomiao. The two binding formations will synergize and form a greater force.&nbsp;

“You told me to bind my soul to the formation and link the two formations together. You told me not to resist the spirit power flowing through my body. You’re obviously laying a trap for me,” Chu Feng replied.

“You were able to see through it?” Master Yin Ren asked.&nbsp;

“Your means are formidable. I wasn’t able to confirm it earlier on, but it looks like my guess was right. You’ve never intended to help me save Miaomiao right from the start. You wish to trap me in here too,” Chu Feng replied.&nbsp;

“Heh…”

Master Yin Ren finally dropped all pretenses.

His earlier nervousness and unease vanished, replaced with cold hostility. This was the first time Chu Feng saw such an expression on his face. It was as if the earlier Master Yin Ren was nothing more than an illusion.

However, Chu Feng knew that this was likely to be Master Yin Ren’s true face.

“Since you have already seen through it, I shan’t waste my breath with you.”

Master Yin Ren waved his sleeves and sent a surge of spirit power toward Chu Feng. Even though his spirit power had been weakened, he was still a rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist.&nbsp;

As for Chu Feng, his spirit power had been weakened by the formation, and he was only at rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation at the very start. Even with his world spiritist bloodline and Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, he was only able to raise his spirit power up to rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation at best.&nbsp;

There was no way he could have been a match for Master Yin Ren.&nbsp;

At least in terms of the difference in strength, Chu Feng was like a fish on a chopping board, awaiting his slaughter.&nbsp;

Yet, Chu Feng was unfazed by Master Yin Ren’s offense. As the spirit power approached him, he flung his sleeves.

Peng!

Master Yin Ren’s spirit power dissipated on the spot.

“You!”

Shock appeared on Master Yin Ren’s confident face. He realized that Chu Feng’s spirit power wasn’t at rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation but rank seven.

“You hid your cultivation! The legacy enhanced your spirit power not just to rank six but rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation?!” Master Yin Ren asked.

“That’s right. My spirit power has already reached rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation after inheriting Lord Situ Qi’s legacy. I intentionally concealed my cultivation so that you would let your guard down,” Chu Feng said.

“In other words, you doubted me right from the start?” Master Yin Ren asked.

“I wasn’t certain, but I had a feeling that you were untrustworthy. It’d be wiser to prepare for an unexpected situation. It’s just that I didn’t expect you to be so vicious as to want to confine me to this area. From the looks of it now, your offer to treat Princess Xiaoxiao is also nothing more than a hoax. You must have other plans in mind.&nbsp;

“If I’m not mistaken, even Princess Xiaoxiao has also been duped by you, right? Speak. What’s your true goal?” Chu Feng asked.

“What are you going to do if I refuse to speak?” Master Yin Ren asked.

“I’ll just have to pry open your mouth myself then,” Chu Feng replied as his eyes turned cold.

He released a burst of spirit power that surged toward Master Yin Ren. In response, Master Yin Ren swiftly gathered his spirit power to defend against Chu Feng’s aggression.

Just like that, the two of them began crossing blows once again.

It was just that the formation had limited their means, so they could only fight against each other using pure spirit power instead of through constructing formations. While Master Yin Ren’s spirit power had been suppressed, he was still far stronger than Chu Feng had expected.&nbsp;

Despite the two of them going all-out, they were unable to deal significant harm to each other, resulting in a stalemate.

Weng!

It was then that a silhouette suddenly appeared in the area. It was none other than Princess Xiaoxiao. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She appeared in the form of a projection rather than as a soul, but she was emanating a tremendous amount of energy that far surpassed the other two. It wasn’t that surprising for her to wield that much power given that they were currently inside her soul, where her will reigned supreme.

“Xiaoxiao, you have to help me get rid of Chu Feng. Chu Feng intends to disregard your safety and forcefully extract Xian Miaomiao from your soul. You’ll die if he succeeds!” Master Yin Ren exclaimed.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, don’t listen to his lies. That man has dubious intentions. There’s no doubt that he’s up to no good. Perhaps, he might even see you as nothing more than a puppet. We should get rid of him now. Even without him, I’d still be able to extract Miaomiao from your soul.

“As for your illness, I’ll think of another way to save you. You can trust me on that,” Chu Feng said.

Princess Xiaoxiao’s gaze flickered hesitantly between the two of them, but she eventually made up her mind. She drifted over to Chu Feng’s side before abruptly striking her palm on his chest.&nbsp;

The strike sent Chu Feng flying out of her soul.

Before Chu Feng realized it, he had already returned back to his own body.

It was also around this moment that Princess Xiaoxiao climbed to her feet from the formation. Similarly, Master Yin Ren, who was still motionless a moment ago, turned his head toward Chu Feng. It would appear that his soul had also returned to his body.

“Why did you do that?” Chu Feng asked.

He sensed that something was amiss here.

With Princess Xiaoxiao’s earlier strength, she could have aided him in defeating Master Yin Ren, but she chose not to do so. She didn’t help Master Yin Ren, but she didn’t help him either.

“I’m sorry, Chu Feng. I know that you wish to save Miaomiao, but I don’t want to die either,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.
