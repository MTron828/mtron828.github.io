Chapter 3910 - Powerful Oppressive Might

“Wuuahh~~~”

In the next instant, screams began to sound from outside.

Chu Feng turned around and saw a whole bunch of imperial guards arriving at the entrance.

However, those imperial guards were all screaming in pain. Like leaves, they collapsed at the first blow, and were beaten back and sent flying repeatedly by a powerful aura.

The power that was beating them back was the oppressive might that had rushed into the palace hall.

However, Chu Feng did not manage to see who that oppressive might belonged to.

Chu Feng also did not understand why the owner of that oppressive might unleashed that oppressive might to push back the Galewind Hunting Clan’s imperial guards.

At the time when Chu Feng was confused, his body was suddenly enveloped by that oppressive might. Then, unable to control himself, he was taken away.

The speed of that oppressive might was simply too fast. Soon, Chu Feng departed the Royal Nation and passed through multiple layers of spirit formations and many different places. In the end, he returned to the surface.

When Chu Feng landed, he had returned to the outside of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

Chu Feng had been brought back by that oppressive might.

After Chu Feng returned, the oppressive might that had brought him back suddenly disappeared.

It was as if it was never there to begin with.

“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”

However, in the next instant, the earth suddenly exploded. Soil and dust soared into the sky, covering the surroundings.

In the next instant, figures began to fly out from beneath the ground. They appeared in Chu Feng’s field of vision.

Those were the Galewind Hunting Clan’s imperial guards.

From a glance, there were many thousands of them.

Every one of them were emitting very powerful auras.

“Brazen human, you dare trespass into our Galewind Hunting Clan’s domain?!”

The imperial guards were all aiming their weapons at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was unable to detect their cultivations. However, he knew that they were extremely powerful. At the very least, they were all Utmost Exalted. Furthermore, they were not simply rank one Utmost Exalted either.

They gave off a very strong sense of oppression towards Chu Feng. That oppressive sensation was even greater than the one that the All-heaven Sect’s Tuoba Chengan brought him.

This meant that those imperial guards were very likely stronger than rank three Utmost Exalted, much stronger.

Had it been before, Chu Feng would’ve likely given up already.

After all, the disparity in strength between him and those imperial guards was simply too enormous.

However, the situation was different now. Even though Chu Feng’s own cultivation couldn’t match theirs, he now stood beside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

In that place, Chu Feng had grasped the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb’s spirit formation once again.

“Humph. This place is not your domain.”

Chu Feng revealed a cold smile. Then, an ice-cold determination appeared in his eyes.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, like a tide, the power of the spirit formation rushed out from Chu Feng. Then, in a spectacular display of might, it rushed to attack those Galewind Hunting Clan’s imperial guards.

“Clamor~~~” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Light shone brightly as heaven and earth trembled. Chu Feng’s current power was simply unparalleled.

No matter how powerful those imperial guards might be, they were akin to a bunch of giant whales falling into an overflowing, massive wave before Chu Feng’s spirit formation’s power.

No matter how they struggled, they were unable to break free from the spirit formation’s power, and could only allow themselves to be suppressed by it.

At that moment, the previously aggressive imperial guards of the Ancient Era’s race were completely battered.

They could only scream in fear under Chu Feng’s power.

Right at that moment, a voice was heard, “So you’re actually someone under the Great Monster Slayer Emperor?”

“Great Monster Slayer Emperor, we’ve agreed that we will keep to ourselves. For you to dispatch your men to infiltrate our clan, this is simply too ignoble of an action, no?”

That voice was particularly loud and resounding. Even though it sounded from underground, it shook the surroundings so hard that even space trembled.

After that voice was heard, a very powerful aura rushed out of the ground and charged ferociously towards Chu Feng.

Even though Chu Feng immediately increased the power of the spirit formation to defend against that power, his spirit formation’s power was akin to a river flowing into the sea before it.

Not only was Chu Feng’s power unable to contend against that power, but his power was even being devoured by it.

Soon, that power arrived before Chu Feng and pressed him to the ground.

Then, Chu Feng was able to see an enormous silhouette emerging from underground and flying into the sky.

That was an enormous creature over ten thousand meters tall.

That creature looked very fierce. It resembled an armored lizard, but had a pair of giant bat-like wings.

As the winds moved, a strong gale was created. Even space itself was being dispersed by the strong gale.

However, it was not that giant beast that had suppressed Chu Feng to the ground. Instead, it was the person standing on top of that giant beast.

It was a man. He looked middle-aged, and emitted an extremely powerful aura, so powerful that it was impossible to estimate his strength.

That man was wore armor. His armor was different from the armor of the General Clansmen and Royal Clansmen. It appeared even more imposing than theirs. Even the materials used to construct his armor were very different.

On his back was an enormous mantle, dozens of meters long, fluttering loudly in the wind.

Whether it was his special armor, his powerful mount or his overwhelming aura, they all illustrated that the middle-aged man was very powerful in the Galewind Hunting Clan.

Most importantly, the man only took a single glance at Chu Feng. That glance was filled with contempt.

Even though Chu Feng had used the power of the spirit formation to beat back so many experts from the Galewind Hunting Clan, the man still didn’t place him in his eyes at all.

At that moment, his gaze turned to the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

“Great Monster Slayer Emperor, come out and explain this. Why did you dispatch this man to my clan?”

“If you do not explain things, I will kill this lackey of yours,” said that man as he stared at the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng shook his head helplessly.

The Great Monster Slayer Emperor had already left. Thus, how could he respond?

“The Great Monster Slayer Emperor has left.”

However, at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard.

Chu Feng was also surprised to hear that voice.

Those words were not spoken by Chu Feng. Instead, they sounded from above the sky. Furthermore, that voice was very aged.

“Who are you?”

The middle-aged man from the Galewind Hunting Clan narrowed his brows as he turned his gaze upward.

“Who this old man is, doesn’t matter. What matters is that you all do not belong in this era.”

“This place is also not a place that you all should come to.”

“I ask you to return. If you are to return now, this old man can let bygones be bygones.”

That aged voice sounded again. Although it was very tranquil, the words spoken were extremely threatening.

That person was actually threatening that powerful Galewind Hunting Clan’s warrior.

“A bunch of trash from the later generation dares to threaten my clan? You’re courting death!”

“Roarrrr~~~”

Following that shout, heaven and earth started to tremble.

The giant flying lizard-like beast flicked its enormous wings. Sending out strong gales with every flap, it soared straight into the depths of the sky.

Its speed was so fast that it disappeared from Chu Feng’s field of view in an instant.

At that moment, the surroundings became particularly quiet.

Both Chu Feng and those Galewind Hunting Clan’s imperial guards were all staring at the sky. They were waiting for a world-shaking battle to break out.
