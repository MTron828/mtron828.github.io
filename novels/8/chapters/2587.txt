Chapter 2587 - Capturing Old Demon Rakshasa Alive

Old Demon Rakshasa half kneeled in midair. Not only was he shivering and bleeding, but his aura was also much weaker than before.

The so-called undying, indestructible and incapable of being injured True Immortal was currently seriously injured.

“No, impossible, this is impossible...”

Even though he was already seriously injured, Old Demon Rakshasa was still unable to accept it.

After all, he was a True Immortal. How could he be injured by Chu Feng, a mere Martial Ancestor?”

“You have looked down on my Ancient Era’s War Sword. It is within reason for you to be injured by it.”

As Chu Feng spoke, rumbles sprang forth in the sky. Controlled by Chu Feng, his Ancient Era’s War Sword once again moved to attack Old Demon Rakshasa.

“Damn it!”

Old Demon Rakshasa let out a snarl. At the same time as he let out that snarl, a sound ripple visible to the naked eye began to charge toward the Ancient Era’s War Sword, shattering it.

“Damn it!”

Chu Feng frowned. His body shifted back. He began to hold onto the Evil God Sword even more tightly.

Old Demon Rakshasa was serious now. The attack he had used earlier was not a casual attack with martial power. Rather, it was a martial skill.

Even though it was only an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill, it managed to defeat the Ancient Era’s War Sword. This was the true strength of True Immortals.

At that moment, Chu Feng realized that no matter how strong he might be, he would not be able to contend against True Immortals as long as he had not stepped into the True Immortal realm.

“Chu Feng, I’ll kill you!”

As Old Demon Rakshasa spoke, he flipped his palm. An Ancestral Armament appeared in his hand. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Having suffered by Chu Feng’s hand once, Old Demon Rakshasa had become truly serious. He planned to kill Chu Feng immediately.

“A grand True Immortal was actually injured by a Martial Ancestor. Old Demon Rakshasa, you are truly humiliating.”

Right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard. Then, two figures appeared behind Old Demon Rakshasa.

Chu Feng’s gaze changed the moment he saw those two people.

Not only were those two people True Immortal-level experts, but they were also people that Chu Feng knew. They were Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian.

Upon seeing Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian, Old Demon Rakshasa’s expression changed immediately. He subconsciously felt that Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian had come to save Chu Feng.

“Damn it!!!”

Suddenly, Old Demon Rakshasa attacked. He thrust his Ancestral Armament at Chu Feng. Countless sword rays started flying toward Chu Feng.

Those sword rays were so powerful and their speed was so fast that even Chu Feng started frowning upon seeing them. He knew that... if he didn’t use the Evil God Sword, he would most definitely not be able to block that incoming attack.

The reason for that was because the sword rays that filled the sky were an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.

Old Demon Rakshasa had utilized an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill right away. From this, it could be seen how determined he was to kill Chu Feng.

However, to the crowd’s surprise, even though Old Demon Rakshasa had already unleashed his attack toward Chu Feng, Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian were still standing there motionlessly. Furthermore, there was no change to their expressions either. It was as if they did not care about Chu Feng’s life and death at all. Their tranquility at that moment was scary.

‘So they didn’t come to save Chu Feng? That’s understandable. After all, Chu Feng is the enemy of the Kong Heavenly Clan.’

At that moment, Old Demon Rakshasa started to rejoice. He felt that Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua had not come to save Chu Feng.

He felt that it was very possible that their appearance in that place was merely a coincidence.

And now, the Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill that he had unleashed was already closing in on Chu Feng. Merely the might of his attack was something that Chu Feng would not be able to endure.

Even if Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian were to interfere now, they would not be able to save Chu Feng.

Chu Feng would be undoubtedly killed.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right at that moment, a purple shield suddenly appeared out of thin air right before Chu Feng.

That was not an ordinary shield. Rather, it was an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was a very powerful Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.

The reason why that Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill was powerful was because that Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill actually managed to directly block Old Demon Rakshasa’s Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.

“That is?”

It was only at that moment that Old Demon Rakshasa noticed that there was actually an individual wearing a black gown behind that Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.

One could not see that person’s facial appearance. However, from his aura, one could tell that he was a True Immortal.

He was the one who had unleashed that purple shield to block Old Demon Rakshasa’s attack.

“Who are you?”

Old Demon Rakshasa asked with a cold voice.

However, that black-gowned individual did not bother to respond to Old Demon Rakshasa. Instead, he turned around and bowed to Chu Feng. Then, with an extremely respectful tone, he said to Chu Feng, “Master, this subordinate has come late.”

“Subordinate?”

At that moment, not only was Old Demon Rakshasa astonished, but the surrounding crowd was also astonished.

That True Immortal-level expert actually addressed himself as subordinate and called Chu Feng master?

Could it be that they were was an expert from Hero City?

That said, regardless of who he might be, there was one thing that was certain -- he was on Chu Feng’s side.

“Senior, it’s you again?”

At that moment, Chu Feng also rejoiced in his heart. Although Chu Feng was unable to see the black-clothed individual’s facial appearance due to his outfit, Chu Feng was able to feel his aura.

The black-clothed individual was the same mysterious expert that had come to his rescue when the Kong Heavenly Clan was trying to kill him two years ago.

He never expected that he would encounter that person again at that moment.

“Master, allow me to take care of this Old Demon Rakshasa for you first.”

As that mysterious expert spoke, he revealed his Ancestral Armament and moved to attack Old Demon Rakshasa.

“Come, as if this True Immortal would fear you!”

Old Demon Rakshasa was not to be outdone. He held his Ancestral Armament and rushed forth to confront the incoming mysterious expert.

“Woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, an astonishing scene happened.

Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua who were originally watching from the sidelines also revealed their Ancestral Armaments and joined the battle.

Furthermore, they were actually helping that mysterious individual against Old Demon Rakshasa.

“You all, to attack one with many, have you no sense of shame?! Is this what a righteous power is?!!!”

Old Demon Rakshasa was seriously injured by Chu Feng to begin with. Thus, it was already very difficult for him to take on that mysterious individual by himself. And now, with Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua joining the battle, his expression changed immediately.

“The Infant Soul Sect has done all sorts of evil. Everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is qualified to put you all to death. As such, how could confronting you be having no shame?” Kong Shunlian spoke coldly.

“Old Demon Rakshasa, with all the evil deeds that you’ve done in your lifetime, even dying ten thousand times will be insufficient to make up for them.”

“Thus, someone like you should not mention the word ‘shame’ to us. You are not qualified to use the word shame,” Kong Yuehua spoke ill-intended words at Old Demon Rakshasa. It could be seen that both Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua hated Old Demon Rakshasa.

“Eeaaahh~~~”

Faced with the joint attack from the three of them, how could Old Demon Rakshasa, who was already seriously injured, possibly be able to withstand them? Soon, he began to scream nonstop. He was easily defeated by the three of them.

However, the three of them did not immediately execute Old Demon Rakshasa. Instead, they used special methods to bind him.

After they finished binding Old Demon Rakshasa, Hun Lian and Xiaoleng, Kong Shunlian, Kong Yuehua and that mysterious expert brought Chu Feng with them and left. They were bringing Chu Feng elsewhere.

“Master, are you alright? Take these medicinal pellets immediately. Please allow this subordinate to help heal your injuries.”

While traveling, that mysterious individual suddenly stopped and moved to support Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had a very frightening complexion at that moment. His body was shivering nonstop, and his aura had become extremely weak.

Furthermore, he was bleeding from his seven facial orifices. That was especially true for his mouth, as a lot of blood was flowing from his mouth. Furthermore, the color of that blood was black.
