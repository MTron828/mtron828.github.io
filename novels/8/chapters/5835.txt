Chapter 5836: A Formation Encompassing an Entire Galaxy

Chapter 5836: A Formation Encompassing an Entire Galaxy

“Wait a moment. You said that someone defeated Huangfu Shengyu?” Zhao Gongyi asked.

Unlike the elders, he was more concerned about Huangfu Shengyu.

“Young master, it’s a man named Chu Feng. He has quite the background too. He’s said to be an Asura Spirit World’s world spiritist, and he has a True God level Asura World Spirit under his command,” the white-haired elder said.

“He has a True God level Asura World Spirit serving him? Is he a True Dragon World Spiritist?” Zhao Gongyi asked.

“He’s still a God-cloak World Spiritist, and he hasn’t even reached pinnacle God-cloak,” the white-haired elder replied.

“What a joke! How could a God-cloak World Spiritist possibly have a True God level Asura World Spirit? You should vet your information more thoroughly!” Zhao Gongyi sneered.

The white-haired elder didn’t argue. His job was to report the information he had gathered, not to go against the young master.

“Your information is unreliable! How could Huangfu Shengyu lose to a present-era cultivator? I guess I’ll have to be the one to curb Huangfu Shengyu,” Zhao Gongyi said as he walked away.

Even though he was skeptical about this matter, he appeared to be in a much better mood after hearing this news.

The elders glanced at one another. Huangfu Shengyu had once defeated their young master, and their young master had been wanting to exact vengeance since then. However, their young master was not confident of making a move, as the gap between them had been too huge.

“Is the news reliable?” the other elders who came back with Zhao Gongyi asked.

“Both the matter concerning the Nine Heavens’ Zenith and Huangfu Bufan’s death have been witnessed by many people, so they are most definitely accurate. On top of that, Chu Feng has conquered the legendary energy, Genesis Bloodline,” the white-haired elder said.

“Genesis Bloodline?”

The crowd was shocked. They knew what the Genesis Bloodline represented.

“There’s one more matter. Puppeteer Exalted was here. He said that a power inside the Ancestral Martial Galaxy named Hidden Dragon Martial Sect has a secret realm, and there are many treasures inside the secret realm. Our Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion can rise to greater heights if we can obtain the treasures. Puppeteer Exalted is looking to gather a large team of people to attack the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Lord Pavilion Master is interested in it,” the white-haired elder said.

“Who are we working with? The present-era powers?” the elders asked.

“How could the present-era powers possibly be qualified to work with us? We would be working with other Ancient Era’s clans,” the white-haired elder said.

“We’d be working with other Ancient Era’s clans? We have been completely freed from our restraints, but none of us have been willing to reveal ourselves despite the weakness of the present-era cultivators. Joining hands now would mean revealing all of us at once. Does Puppeteer Exalted have the means to mobilize all of us?”

The elders voiced their skepticism regarding this matter.

The Ancient Era’s clans were incredibly proud; they didn’t just look down on the present-era cultivators but on one another too. It had been many years, but none of them had ever gathered together in a single place. It wouldn’t be easy to bring them together. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Wait a moment. You said Lord Pavilion Master is interested in it. That means there’s some credibility to Puppeteer Exalted’s words. A place that interests Lord Pavilion Master would pique the interest of the other Ancient Era’s clans too. Now that we’re no longer restrained, it’s only a matter of time before we return to the world of cultivation. With the allure of a treasure before us, there’s no harm in bringing forward our return,” another elder spoke up.

The other elders revealed grim expressions, as they realized that something unprecedented might just happen.

...

What the Ancient Era’s clans thought was a secret quickly became known throughout the world of cultivation. It didn’t take long for all powerhouses to learn that there was a secret realm in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and it contained invaluable treasures.

Most people initially shrugged it off as a ridiculous rumor, as they thought that the Ancestral Martial Galaxy was a backward place. It was ridiculous for invaluable treasures to appear there, and it was even more ridiculous that it required the present-era cultivators and the Ancient Era’s powerhouses to work together to siege.

But as time passed, the powerhouses verified the authenticity of the rumors.

This matter would shake up the world of cultivation, and the discussions surrounding it were no less than the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

Soon, a new piece of news surfaced—the Ancient Era’s clans had decided to attack the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

However, none of the present-era powers showed interest in this matter. At least on the surface, all of them had turned down Puppeteer Exalted’s offer to cooperate on this matter, including the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

In contrast, there were many minor powers interested in it. They were considered weak in the world of cultivation, but they believed they had enough power to trample all over the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Thus, many people began making their way over.

Not too long later, there was another major piece of news—an invisible protective formation had appeared around the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. This massive protective formation encompassed the entire galaxy, and its defensive prowess was so great that even True God level cultivators were unable to do anything about it.

No one could enter the Ancestral Martial Galaxy anymore. Even teleportation formations failed. Such a formation was unheard of. Even the Seven Realms Galaxy, where the strongest world spiritists gathered, had never heard of such a formidable formation.

The news drew skepticism from most people, drawing more cultivators to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy to verify the matter. To their shock, the news was real.

This was inconceivable.

A protective formation capable of withstanding a True God level cultivator’s attack was not rare, but it was nigh impossible to find one that encompassed an entire galaxy. Yet, it appeared at the most unlikely place.

As expected of the most prosperous galaxy in the earlier years of the present era. It might have fallen into decline, but its foundation was still much stronger than that of the other galaxies.

This added credibility to the rumors that the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had invaluable treasures.

It didn’t take long before the Ancestral Martial Galaxy was the most-talked topic in the world of cultivation, pushing it to the center of attention once again.
