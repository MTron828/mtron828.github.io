Chapter 4532 - Long Daozhi’s Cultivation

“That’s right. Just earlier, our Ancestral Martial Dragon City practically gave away all that our ancestors had accumulated to the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.

“But, that was not purely so that we can return to the Dragon Clan. More than that, it was for your sake.

“If it wasn’t to save you, not to mention using all the wealth and resources we’ve accumulated, we would not necessarily agree to give them even half of it,” Long Ning spoke very emotionally.

“Thus, that Flying Feather Heavenly Sect is still here, correct?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s right, they’re still here. I beg you, you must not provoke them again.

“If you are to do that, you will not only cause our Ancestral Martial Dragon Sect to forfeit our wealth and resources to them, we might even have to forfeit our lives.

“Chu Feng, I truly do not wish to blame you. But... but...

“Those are the wealth and resources slowly accumulated by our Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s ancestors!!!

“Because of you, my father had given all of our clan’s accumulated wealth to them. My father had become our Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s sinner...”

At this point, Long Ning was sobbing nonstop.

Even though she had shouted at him, Chu Feng was not angry at all after seeing how tears covered her face. Instead, he was feeling very sorry for her.

He understood Long Ning’s current frame of mind very well.

Chu Feng descended from the sky and gently patted Long Ning’s head.

“It’s alright. Everything’s fine now. Don’t cry anymore. Everything would be fine as long as they’re still here.”

“Come, I’ll bring you over. I’ll demand them to return everything.”

After he finished saying those words, a strong gale rose forth.

By the time the crowd reacted to what was going on, Chu Feng and Long Ning had disappeared.

“Where did they go?”

“Where’s brother Chu Feng?”

“He... he couldn’t possibly have gone to seek out the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, right?”

Kong Tianhui, Kong Cixian and others immediately turned pale with fright.

Originally, they had no idea the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect possessed such a terrifying backing. After listening to Long Ning, they realized that the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect was an existence that they cannot afford to provoke.

Because of that, Kong Tianhui, Wuming Doutian and others all set off to chase after Chu Feng.

...

The Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s main hall.

Long Daozhi and the experts of the Flying Feather Heavenly Clan were all still here.

Placed before them were thousands of gigantic chests.

The chests were filled with shiny treasures. Apart from treasured materials and resources, there were rare artifacts, miraculous medicines, secret skills, and high level weaponries.

In brief, the contents of the chests were all invaluable items.

Those chests could be said to be the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s entire wealth.

Many elders from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect were surrounding those chests and inspecting them.

As for the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, they were all feeling extremely distressed by this scene.

Some of the more disappointing elders even began to tear up secretly.

After all, those were the wealth and resources slowly accumulated by their ancestors.

After checking the contents thoroughly, the elders of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect reported, “Lord Sect Master, the quantity is right.”

After learning that the quantity was right, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster and the Supreme Elder Dian Kuang started grinning from ear to ear.

“City Master Long, it would appear that boy by the name of Chu Feng is someone very important to you.”

“You can rest assured. I will give you face. From today on, no one from our Flying Feather Heavenly Sect will touch that Chu Feng.”

“As for your return to the Dragon Clan, you can leave that to our Flying Feather Heavenly Sect too,” said the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’ Sectmaster.

“I’ll have to trouble Sectmaster Dian then.”

While Long Daozhi was also very pained by the amount of wealth he had to give up, there was nothing that could be done about it. As matters stood, he had to endure silently.

The people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect lifted up those treasures. They were preparing to leave the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

“Wait!”

But, right at this moment, a loud voice exploded from afar.

Looking in the direction of the voice, the crowd noticed two figures standing in the sky.

They were Chu Feng and Long Ning.

“Chu Feng, why can’t you listen? I beg you, let’s return.”

Long Ning was no longer in a fury like before. Instead, she was humbly begging Chu Feng.

She only wished to bring Chu Feng away from here. She doesn’t want him to provoke the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect again.

Seeing Chu Feng’s arrival, the expressions of Long Daozhi and others also changed. They realized things were going to turn bad.

“Lord Sectmaster, that’s him! He’s the one that killed our sect members!”

Suddenly, a female disciple from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect pointed at Chu Feng and shouted.

That female disciple was the person Chu Feng spared before.

She was also the cause of the conflict between Chu Feng and the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Oh? So you’re that Chu Feng.

“It would appear that you are indeed a talent. It’s no wonder City Master Long shields you like so. You can rest assured. Since City Master Long is shielding you, I will naturally have to give him face.

“But, since you’ve come, you’ll still have to provide an explanation for your behavior.

“I wouldn’t make things difficult for you. You merely have to apologize to my sect’s disciple and I will drop this matter,” said the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster.

His attitude was extremely arrogant. It was as if he was helping Chu Feng by giving him the opportunity to apologize.

“Apologize? Someone like her is worthy of my apology? Not to mention her, even you are not worthy of my apology.”

Chu Feng took a glance at the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s sectmaster. Contempt filled his eyes.

“What did you say?! Are you truly tired of living?!”

The people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect were all enraged by Chu Feng’s words.

“Everyone, Chu Feng is still very young. I hope that you all will not make things difficult for him,” Long Daozhi immediately offered an explanation.

“Enough, enough. I’ll give City Master Long face today.”

After saying those words, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster looked to Chu Feng, “Kid, you’re extremely lucky to have someone like City Master Long shielding you. I’ll let you off on his behalf this time around.”

He was looking at Chu Feng like he was taking pity on Chu Feng.

Seeing the Flying Feather Heavenly Clan’s Sectmaster being willing to spare Chu Feng, the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City heaved sighs of relief.

But, Chu Feng was unwilling to appreciate the so-called kindness of not looking further into this matter.

“Indeed, I am very lucky. Unfortunately, you all are very unlucky. You’re extremely unlucky to encounter me, Chu Feng,” said Chu Feng.

The people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City immediately turned green in the face the moment they heard those words from Chu Feng.

As for those from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, they all flew into rage.

“Insolent bastard! What did you say?!”

Chu Feng ignored the clowns from the Flying Father Heavenly Sect and looked to that female disciple, “Hey, do you still remember what I told you then?”

“Of course I do. You’re the one who told me to report the matter of you killing our Flying Father Heavenly Sect’s disciples to my sect.”

“You also told me that you’re coming to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, that if we want to seek revenge, we should come to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City to find you,” said that female disciple.

“What?!”

“Chu Feng, you’re the one who told her you’re coming to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, that they should come here to find you for revenge?”

Long Daozhi and Long Ning looked to Chu Feng with complicated expressions on their faces.

“That’s right. I told her that,” Chu Feng nodded.

“Chu Feng, you... you... you...”

Long Ning turned deathly pale with rage. She seemed like she was about to collapse from anger.

Even Long Daozhi was left speechless.

They did not anticipate for this disaster to be courted by Chu Feng personally.

“You still haven’t finished saying everything I told you. I didn’t only tell you to come seek me out at the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

“There’s more. That’s the most important part. Did you forget to report that?” Chu Feng said to the female disciple.

“I naturally remembered.

“You said that if anyone from our Flying Feather Heavenly Sect dared to touch you, you will have their life. That if we don’t believe that will happen, we can attempt it!” said that female disciple.

“Insolent!”

“Truly insolent! This insolent bastard, who gave him the nerve to dare look down upon our Flying Feather Heavenly Sect like so?!”

“Kill him! We must kill him! If we don’t kill him, how could our Flying Feather Heavenly Sect continue to exist after being humiliated like such?!”

The people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect all exploded with anger. Their desire to kill Chu Feng soared nonstop.

As they were extremely conceited and harbored resentment toward Chu Feng to begin with, they were thoroughly furious after hearing those words.

“Kid, did you really say those words?” That Dian Kuang revealed a frown as he pointed to Chu Feng.

“That’s right, I said those words. What’s this? You wanted to give it a try?” Chu Feng asked with narrowed eyes.

Not only was there no trace of fear on his face, his eyes were filled with contempt as he looked to Dian Kuang.

As Dian Kuang was someone with a fiery temper to begin with, how could he possibly put up with such humiliation?

“You bastard! You truly wish to die!”

“Today, your daddy I will tear you apart alive!”

Suddenly, wind soared around Dian Kuang. Then, his body shifted. He was rushing toward Chu Feng.

His two hands spread open like claws. That posture of his...

He was really planning to tear Chu Feng apart.

“Woosh---”

But, before he could reach Chu Feng, a figure appeared before Chu Feng like a phantom.

Even though what appeared before Chu Feng was a person, the feeling that person gave off was akin to an impregnable wall that shielded Chu Feng behind it.

It was Long Daozhi.

Standing before Chu Feng, a vicious glint appeared in Long Daozhi’s eyes.

“Boom---”

Then, his oppressive might swept forth like a fierce yet invisible beast.

His powerful oppressive might swept across in all directions. Dian Kuang was unable to withstand it at all.

Even though Long Daozhi did not cause harm to Dian Kuang, Dian Kuang was still sent flying by his oppressive might as the difference in strength was simply too much.

Dian Kuang’s cultivation was only that of a rank five Utmost Exalted. Long Daozhi, on the other hand, was a rank seven Utmost Exalted.
