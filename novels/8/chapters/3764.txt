Chapter 3764 - Gasp With Admiration And Emotions

As matters had already reached this point, no matter how unwilling the crowd might be, they still had no choice but to accept things as they were.

Fortunately, the Chu Heavenly Clan had Chu Feng.

Although he was a person of the younger generation and his cultivation was also only that of an Exalted, Chu Feng was capable of releasing a terrifying army of ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits through the Battle God’s Halberd. That in itself was already extremely extraordinary...

On top of that, the Battle God’s Halberd was actually capable of allowing him to obtain a rank two Utmost Exalted cultivation himself.

It was precisely the power of the Battle God’s Halberd that had allowed Chu Feng to suppress Linghu Zhishi earlier.

Had that All-heaven Sect’s Supreme Elder not interfered, Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan would’ve likely extinguished the entire Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Although his cultivation was still insufficient for him to become the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, his ability to use the Battle God’s Halberd had illustrated how extraordinary he was.

On top of that, everyone present knew how talented Chu Feng was.

If he was allowed to continue to grow, it would only be a matter of time before he surpassed Long Daozhi.

As such, the fact that Chu Feng was part of the Chu Heavenly Clan eased the crowd’s hearts somewhat.

Taking him into consideration, the crowd began to persuade themselves to accept the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Because of that, although the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was the current overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the crowd all felt that the true overlord was already the person of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation, Chu Feng.

Seeing Chu Feng, the crowd all gasped with admiration and emotions.

Chu Feng had carried the title of Chu Xuanyuan’s son the entire time.

However, he had already surpassed his father and grandfather.

After all, even Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan were not powerful enough to contend against the Starfield Master Realm.

However, Chu Feng had nearly managed to crush the entire Linghu Heavenly Clan.

When even the people of the older generation were gasping with admiration and emotions, those from the younger generation naturally felt even more awed.

This was especially true for Xia Yun’er, Song Yunfei, Chu Huanyu, Chu Haoyan, Li Anzhi and others.

Back then, they were all people capable of contending against Chu Feng. However, now... Chu Feng had become the person that everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield looked up to.

Even though they’d already recognized the disparity between them and Chu Feng, they had not expected the disparity to increase so quickly, and by so much.

That said, although they were sighing and gasping emotionally, their lips were all raised into the same sort of curve.

Even though they already knew that Chu Feng would grow to become the strongest expert in the Ancestral Martial Starfield and they would never be able to catch up to him, when they thought about how he had actually competed and fought against them in the past, they all felt that they were very fortunate.

After kneeling for a short moment, the crowd stood up in succession. Long Daozhi turned his gaze to the Tantai Heavenly Clan and a few other powers.

Those powers that he looked at, all had a close relationship with the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

“Tantai Heavenly Clan, Jiaoli Heavenly Clan, Nightmare Spirit Clan, Heaven Reaching Beast Clan.”

“Are you not allies of the Linghu Heavenly Clan? Why did you not follow Linghu Zhishi when he left?” Long Daozhi spoke with a mocking and ridiculing tone.

“City Master Long, we were indeed allies with the Linghu Heavenly Clan before. However, we had no idea they were colluding with the All-heaven Sect. If we had known, we would have never agreed to help them.”

“Besides, we actually did not do much in the war between the Linghu Heavenly Clan and the Wuming Clan. We merely backed them up a little, increasing their power.”

“City Master Long, our alliance with the Linghu Heavenly Clan has long been voided. We truly had no idea about the matter regarding the All-heaven Sect.”

The four clan chiefs all tried their hardest to explain themselves.

Even the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, an Utmost Exalted-level existence, had a look of fear all over his face.

Afraid. Of course they’d be afraid. With how powerful Long Daozhi was, they truly did not wish to follow in the footsteps of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

“You all allied with the Linghu Heavenly Clan to take on the original master of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Your actions were those of a mutiny. Do you think you’ll be able to escape responsibility just by declaring that you’ve broken your alliance?” Long Daozhi asked coldly.

“This...”

Hearing those words, the expressions of the four clan chiefs turned even uglier.

After all, what he’d said was very reasonable. Logically, they were indeed in the wrong.

It was as Long Daozhi had said, what they’d done was a mutiny.

With the situation being like that, the four clan chiefs were completely terrified. They felt that they might end up suffering enormously.

In fact, they were not the only ones thinking that way. The other people were also thinking that way.

However, to the crowd’s surprise, after Long Daozhi deliberately made things difficult for the four clan chiefs, he did not mete out any punishment. Instead, he decided to have the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief decide how to punish them.

With the personality of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he would naturally seek harmony.

Thus, the four clan chiefs only received verbal warnings, and not any substantial punishment.

After that, Long Daozhi made an announcement to call it a day.

The crowd all understood his intention. Thus, after bidding their farewells, they all returned to their respective worlds.

The grand existences like Exalted Heavenly Fate also took their leave.

Before Exalted Heavenly Fate left, although he didn’t say anything, he took a glance at Chu Feng.

That glance of his was filled with complicated emotions.

He had seen a lot of people in his life. However, Chu Feng was most definitely the person that he would not be able to forget the most.

He had made countless prophecies throughout his life. All of them had come true. Only Chu Feng had managed to shatter his prophecy.

The Chu Heavenly Clan had originally thought that Long Daozhi would brief them on what to do after everyone left.

However, to their surprise, Long Daozhi did not tell them anything. He left with the other two City Masters without bothering with anything.

It seemed like they were truly planning to hand the Ancestral Martial Starfield to the Chu Heavenly Clan to manage.

As for how they would manage it, it was all up to the Chu Heavenly Clan. The three City Masters were not going to involve themselves in the matter at all.

Because of this, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief found himself in a very difficult situation.

To him, the weight of Starfield Master was simply too heavy. It was so heavy that he found it somewhat difficult to bear.

Of course, although the great majority of the powers had left, there was still a small portion remaining.

They’d decided to stay to congratulate the Chu Heavenly Clan on becoming the new overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Although the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief knew that those powers were opportunists trying to curry favors, he could not neglect them. In fact, he went out of his way to personally entertain them.

That said, Chu Feng, Gu Mingyuan and the others simply paid no attention to those powers.

Because of that, they did not bother to entertain the powers that came to congratulate the Chu Heavenly Clan. Instead, they all returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan to rest.

Finally, Gu Mingyuan asked the question, “Chu Feng, where did you obtain that grand protective formation of yours?”

When she asked that, Chu Lingxi, Grandmaster Liangqiu and others also looked over to Chu Feng curiously.

Compared to the Battle God’s Halberd, the protective formation was clearly much more powerful.

Because of that, they were all very curious as to the origin of that protective formation.

“Regarding that... actually, even if I don’t say anything, you all will still be able to guess it,” said Chu Feng.

“Could it be, it really is that Ox-nosed Old Daoist?” asked Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Actually, Grandmaster Liangqiu had already guessed this in his heart.

After all, he had already learned that his old friend was actually a disguise of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. The true strength the Ox-nosed Old Daoist possessed was simply unfathomable.

“What? That Ox-nosed Old Daoist?”

Grandmaster Liangqiu’s words astonished Gu Mingyuan, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others.

Then, they looked at Grandmaster Liangqiu like they were looking at a fool.

“Grandmaster Liangqiu, what are you talking about? Shouldn’t it be Senior Zhu? Why would it be that Ox-nose?”

Although they’d learned that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had successfully helped Chu Feng fuse with his Divine Power, Gu Mingyuan and the others still felt that he was a very weak individual. After all, the unreliable image of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was already deeply rooted in their heads.

Because of that, Gu Mingyuan and the others had assumed that the person who’d given Chu Feng the protective formation was that old man Zhu.

After all, they felt old man Zhu to be the person who was truly unfathomable.

Seeing Gu Mingyuan and the others reacting with such surprise, Grandmaster Liangqiu suddenly laughed.

“Actually, Brother Zhu is the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Brother Zhu is merely a disguise of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.”

“Gu Mingyuan, we’ve all underestimated Ox-nose. That guy is stronger than all of us," Grandmaster Liangqiu said with a smile.

“Grandmaster, is what you said the truth?”

Gu Mingyuan and the others all found his words to be incredulous.

“How could I lie about this? If you don’t believe me, you can ask young friend Chu Feng,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“That is indeed the case.” Chu Feng nodded.

“This...”

After Chu Feng confirmed it, Gu Mingyuan, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others looked at each other in dismay. The astonishment on their faces grew even more intense.

This news was truly something that they found very difficult to accept.

After all, it was simply too shocking.

Not to mention them, anyone would react in the same manner as they did if they learned about the matter.

“It would appear that one truly cannot judge a person by their appearance." Chu Xuanzhengfa suddenly gasped in admiration after the shock passed.

Gu Mingyuan and the others understood his gasp of admiration.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the Battle God’s Halberd Chu Feng held in his hand began to tremble violently.

This caught the attention of everyone present.

Under the focus of the crowd, the halberd started to shine with light. It was a spirit formation. A very powerful spirit formation had enveloped the Battle God’s Halberd.

Following that, a voice sounded from it. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice.

“Boy, I’m only lending this thing to you, not giving it to you.”

“Now, you will have to return it to its rightful owner. Remember, do not forget what you’ve promised me. Make sure to not make me lose face.”

“Clank~~~”

After those words were said, the Battle God’s Halberd broke free from Chu Feng’s grasp and began to rapidly fly away. Its speed was so fast that it disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Gu Mingyuan wanted to give chase. However, she stopped before she actually flew after the Battle God’s Halberd.

The reason for that was because she discovered that it was simply flying too fast. Even if she gave her all to chase after it, she would not be able to catch up to it.

Even though the Battle God’s Halberd had decided to leave of its own accord, Chu Feng showed no trace of worry on his face.

He knew that the Battle God’s Halberd must’ve been controlled by the spirit formation, and was flying towards the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s location.

Although Chu Feng was very collected, Gu Mingyuan and the others all looked at him with astonished looks on their faces.

“Was that also the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s trick?”
