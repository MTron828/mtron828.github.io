Chapter 2704 - Pursuing Chu Feng

Chu Feng had entered the hunting grounds. He was finally able to see the true identity of the hunting grounds.

The hunting grounds was extremely large. Chu Feng was currently in a forest. Using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to tell that there were mountain ranges and plains in the distance.

That hunting grounds was truly much larger than Chu Feng had anticipated.

After entering the hunting grounds, Chu Feng noticed that many people were not planning to move after entering. Instead, they continued to stay in the forest.

Through their conversations, Chu Feng finally realized why so many people decided to participate in the hunt even though they clearly did not possess the strength to obtain rewards.

Turned out, they had simply not entered the hunting grounds for the hunt. Rather, it was for fame.

The reason for that was because there was a barrier at the entrance of the hunting grounds. By passing through the entrance, they would have received acknowledgement to participate in the hunt.

To world spiritists, this could be said to be a sign of having their world spirit techniques acknowledged.

What those people wanted was precisely this. As long as they were able to enter the hunt, they would be able to boast about it to others.

Chu Feng did not bother with those people. Instead, he proceeded directly toward the location that Xia Yun’er had told him about, toward the direction of that special World Spirit Beast.

However, Chu Feng had no idea that at practically the moment he left the starting point, those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations rushed in.

They had arrived with the intention to take care of Chu Feng.

“Where’d he go? He clearly entered the hunting grounds too.”

“Damn it, that brat must’ve known we were planning to take care of him, and escaped,” those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations all revealed displeased expressions.

“That’s simple. We merely need to find someone and ask them where he went,” at that moment, a female stood forth.

She actually had a portrait of Chu Feng in her hand.

“Lil’ Sis, you are truly smart,” upon seeing the portrait, the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen all started to praise her.

A person among the Chu Heavenly Clan’s group of younger generations pointed at the nearby crowd and shouted, “Hey! All of you, get over here!”

His voice was extremely loud and clear.

That voice of his scared the surrounding crowd so much that they immediately gathered with terror and unease on their faces.

After all, to them, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s young masters and young ladies were akin to malignant stars. They were existences that none of them could afford to provoke.

“Did any of you see this person?”

“If any of you are able to tell me which direction he left in, I will reward that person,” a Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation pointed at Chu Feng’s portrait as he spoke to the crowd. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I can! I saw that person. He left headed toward the southeast,” a dark-skinned man replied.

“I also saw him. He indeed left in a southeastern direction. Furthermore, his speed was extremely fast. He disappeared in the blink of an eye.”

“However, he stopped for a short period of time after arriving. That is why I managed to see his appearance.”

After that, many others also spoke

Their answers were practically the same. That is, Chu Feng had left headed toward the southeast.

“Let’s go,” after finding out about which direction Chu Feng had left in, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations planned to chase after Chu Feng.

“Milord, what about the reward?”

That dark-skinned man was quite a daring individual. Seeing that those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were planning to leave, he actually spoke to ask for his reward.

After that dark-skinned man spoke, the others that had spoken to verify what the dark-skinned man had said also revealed gazes of expectation.

After all, a reward from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s young masters would most definitely be a considerable amount of treasures.

“Fool.”

However, who would’ve thought that after that dark-skinned man asked for his reward, one of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s young masters raised his hand and shot a palm strike toward him.

“Bang~~~”

While this strike did not contain martial power, it contained a great amount of power. That palm strike directly knocked the man flying several meters away. When he landed, his chest had been caved in, and he had lost consciousness.

“Reward? Sparing the lives of you dogs is already a reward,” that Chu Heavenly Clan’s young master declared.

After he said those words, the rest of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations all burst into loud laughter.

As they continued to laugh, they began to fly in the direction Chu Feng had left in.

Only the scared and shivering crowd remained. It was only at that moment that those people realized how unreasonable and oppressive the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were.

......

Chu Feng had no idea that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were chasing after him.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s speed was extremely fast. It would be simply impossible for those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations to catch up to him. Those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations had already been cast far away by Chu Feng.

Although one could not use one’s martial power, and could only use world spirit techniques...

Chu Feng was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, and Grandmaster Kai Hong’s successor.

Thus, in that place, Chu Feng was like a fish in water.

Although Chu Feng was unable to use martial power, he knew a great amount of spirit formations. While those spirit formations might not have any use in ordinary times, they were useful in the hunting grounds.

At that moment... Chu Feng was standing on a winged cheetah and flying rapidly through the sky. His speed was so fast that bystanders were simply unable to catch sight of him at all.

With his outstanding world spirit techniques, Chu Feng’s strength had surpassed all others in the hunting ground by an entire level. He was simply akin to the ruler of that place.

As he travelled, Chu Feng encountered a lot of World Spirit Beasts.

Those so-called World Spirit Beasts resembled Monstrous Beasts. However, they were all composed of bodies of light, were formed with spirit formations and were not actually alive.

Due to the fact that Chu Feng had a clear target in mind, he did not attempt to hunt down those World Spirit Beasts. Instead, without stopping, he continued to proceed southeast.

Traveling with his all, Chu Feng finally reached the end. He finally arrived at the place mentioned by Xia Yun’er.

It was a very vast area. Even with his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was unable to see the end of that area.

Upon reaching his destination however, Chu Feng had noticed that there were a lot of World Spirit Beasts in that region.

A lot, truly numerous. Never had Chu Feng encountered so many World Spirit Beasts on his entire journey to his destination.

Furthermore, the World Spirit Beasts in that region were all relatively powerful. They were not comparable to other World Spirit Beasts.

Merely, Chu Feng had already rapidly traveled all around the region and inspected it carefully.

Yet, he did not see the World Spirit Beast Xia Yun’er had mentioned.

“Haha, Chu Feng, you’ve guessed wrong. That girl has deceived you again,” at that moment, Her Lady Queen burst into loud laughter.

She had determined that there was simply no such World Spirit Beast like the one Xia Yun’er had mentioned. Instead, Chu Feng had been deceived again.

“That damned girl, I will definitely teach her a lesson in the future,” Chu Feng curled his lips. However, he did not leave the region because of that.

Instead, Chu Feng ran to the outside of the region and set up a grand concealment formation outside. He sealed the region off.

When others saw that grand formation, they would think that they had arrived at the border of the hunting grounds’ southeastern region.

However, there was actually still a vast area ahead. Merely, that vast area had been isolated.

The reason why Chu Feng did this was because he planned to monopolize that region.

The reason for that was because there were simply too many World Spirit Beasts here. Chu Feng felt that even if the World Spirit Beast Xia Yun’er had mentioned was not here, he should still be able to gain a great harvest after killing all the World Spirit Beasts there.

After he finished setting up the grand concealment formation, Chu Feng entered the concealed region and began to hunt.

During that time, the group of Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations finally caught up.

“Where is he? Damn it! We’ve been deceived! That guy simply hasn’t been here at all.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were deceived by Chu Feng’s concealment formation, and thought that they’d reached the southeastern border of the hunting ground.

They carefully searched the surrounding area many times. Yet, they were unable to find any signs of Chu Feng. Thus, they determined that Chu Feng had never gone to the southeast region; that they had been deceived.

“Damn it, let’s go and find that group of people to make them pay for deceiving us,” that Chu Heavenly Clan’s young master who attacked the dark-skinned man earlier said furiously.

“Forget about it. The hunt has already begun. Let’s not lower ourselves to deal with those people for now. We must not waste time for proper business because of them,” someone else said.

“That’s true. We can’t allow ourselves to become laughingstocks for big brother Xianshuo. Let’s hunt some World Spirit Beasts first.”

“Very well. Then let’s act separately,” after the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations came to a decision, they all left in separate directions.

However, there were eight men and two women who decided to stay. The reason for that was because they remembered that region they were in had a lot of World Spirit Beasts. Thus, they felt that it would be a great place to hunt World Spirit Beasts.

“What’s going on? I clearly remember that there were a lot of World Spirit Beasts here in previous years. Why would there be so few this year?”

After hunting for a while, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s ten younger generations realized that something was amiss.

“Do you all feel that this region seemed to have gotten smaller this year around?” A female said.

“Smaller? No, it’s gotten much smaller,” a man said.

“Damn it. It must be the Immortal Armament Villa. They must’ve changed the terrain of the Hunting Ground in order to target us.”

“Then what should we do? Are we to give up on this place?”

“I don’t think that’s wise, no? Although the World Spirit Beasts here are not as concentrated as before, it is still a relatively concentrated place. It would be a pity for us to just give up on this region like this, no?”

Right at that moment, a female said with a very pleased expression on her face, “I have an idea. The people that have participated in the hunt in previous years all know that this is our territory. Thus, practically no one dares to come here,”

“We can announce that we’ve given up on this region this year, so they’ll come here to hunt.”

“As for us, we will go somewhere else to hunt. Once the time is about to end, we can return.”

“At that time, those people would have most likely hunted all of the World Spirit Beasts here.”

“At that time, we can just plunder their World Spirit Bones.”

“Great idea! Let’s do that.”

After hearing that woman’s suggestion, the other nine members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation all echoed in agreement.

After they decided on what to do, they immediately started to implement their plan. They planned to trap the ignorant people nearby.

However, they had no idea that at that moment when they were wracking their brains to scheme for more World Spirit Bones, they had already been deceived by Chu Feng.

At that moment, Chu Feng was enjoying that vast region by himself. He was hunting down all of the World Spirit Beasts in the region.

In previous years, that region had belonged to them.

But this time around, it belonged to Chu Feng.
