Chapter 5974: Can’t Wait For It

Fifteen minutes later, Chu Feng changed his hand seal, and tremendous spirit power flowed from his hands to form a gigantic formation sphere enveloping all of them.

The formation revolved around them like a beautiful painting, but it wasn’t a painting but complex formation runes.

“This formation!”

The Totem Nine Daoists, including Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon, widened their eyes in astonishment. They could tell that the formation was intricate but ingenious, to the point where it surpassed all their expectations.

This formation looked no different from an artwork, even to world spiritists of their caliber.

“Young hero Chu Feng, w-who in the world are you?” Daoist Fourth Dragon asked with a hint of fear and respect in his voice.

He had been completely won over by Chu Feng’s formation.

Chu Feng had constructed this formation for them, or more specifically, Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon. However, even a True Dragon World Spiritist like Daoist Fourth Dragon wouldn’t have been able to create something like this, let alone a God-cloak World Spiritist.

Yet, Chu Feng pulled it off.

This was his first time witnessing what Chu Feng was capable of, and it blew his mind. It defied all common sense.

“Elder, I am just a junior,” Chu Feng replied with a smile before turning to Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon. “Elders, please prepare per my formation. It should tide us through this crisis.”

“All right,” Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon replied without any hesitation.

Chu Feng’s formation might be complex, but they were able to comprehend it as pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritists, which was why they had no complaints. This formation was not a single formation; it was a compound formation comprising many different formations.

The key purpose of this formation was to breach the sealing formation, but it also included a concealment formation, an assault formation, a disguise formation, and even a teleportation formation.

This formation allowed the Totem Nine Daoists to conceal themselves from outsiders even if they were the ones constructing and channeling it. And if outsiders tried to get close, they could attack them via the assault formation.

Even if they were overpowered, they could escape through the teleportation formation too.

Each of these formations was formidable by itself, such that fusing them must have been tough. This was an incredible feat they wouldn’t even dare think of.

If someone had told them before this that they could construct such an ingenious formation, they would have slapped that person into space. Such an incredible formation should have been beyond the means of mortals!

Yet, such an impossible situation had happened before their eyes, and they could tell with a glance that the formation was feasible.

“Young hero Chu Feng, did you inherit this ingenious formation from your master? May I ask what formation this is? You need not answer if I’m probing too much. I’m merely awed by the ingenuity of this formation” Daoist First Dragon asked with a humble tone.

He was convinced that Chu Feng had the backing of someone formidable.

“Elder, I have just obtained this formation as a reward from the remnant. It is the Heaven Tome’s Initiate Tome,” Chu Feng honestly replied.

“Initiate Tome?”

The Totem Nine Daoists were surprised.

“Young hero Chu Feng, is this Initiate Tome a formation?” Daoist First Dragon asked.

“It is a formation, but it’s no ordinary formation. It is a highly flexible formation that can be adapted to deal with different formations. Elder, have you never heard of the Initiate Tome before?” Chu Feng asked.

“Not at all. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion possesses the Heaven Tome too, but this is our first time hearing about the Initiate Tome. From the looks of it, they must have been withholding information about the Heaven Tome,” Daoist First Dragon remarked,

While they continued escaping, Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon began constructing a formation based on Chu Feng’s formation.

Soon, they completed the formation.

“Elders, let’s not rush into counterattacking. For now, let’s slow down our speed a little. Also, let’s put on a weak front and pretend that we’re just barely holding on. It’ll be best if we can mislead them into thinking that we are cornered,” Chu Feng said.

“Understood.” Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon smiled.

They understood Chu Feng’s intention, so they did as they were told.

Instead of fighting back with their newly-constructed formation, they intentionally slowed their speed and waited for the formation net to catch up with them.

All of a sudden, deafening thunder rumbled from the sky. A colossal amount of spirit power suddenly surged toward the formation net, causing its size and speed to greatly increase.

“I guess there’s no need for us to slow down. We’re bound to be captured at this rate.”

Chu Feng and the others realized that while they were preparing countermeasures, their enemies were busy strengthening the sealing formation.

Soon, the formation net fell to trap Chu Feng, but a powerful surge of spirit power gushed forth to resist it.

At the same time, the Totem Nine Daoists vanished into thin air. They had concealed themselves through the formation.

In the sealing formation’s formation core, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s elders cheered at having finally captured Chu Feng. However, unease flickered across the eyes of Ling Mouzi, who was channeling the sealing formation.

“The sealing formation has caught Chu Feng from now, but something is pushing it back. It’s a formation, but I can’t sense how powerful the formation is. It doesn’t seem like someone is protecting him. Is it just a treasure?” Ling Mouzi murmured.

“Who cares whether it’s a treasure or that someone is protecting him? The important thing is that he’s now in our grasp. I want to see him trapped with my own eyes!” Jie Tian bellowed.

His face and lips had turned pale, looking as if he was on the verge of death. Even his footsteps were shaky. This was the price he had to pay for channeling the sealing formation.

However, it was all worth it, as he was now the greatest contributor toward Chu Feng’s capture! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

An elder rushed forward to support Jie Tian, but the latter angrily shook him off and said, “There’s no need for that. I can walk on my own!”

He staggered past the elder and entered the teleportation formation. He was looking forward to seeing Chu Feng bow down in defeat to him.
