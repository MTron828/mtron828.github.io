Chapter 3433 - Chu Feng’s Smile

“I don’t think our Chu Heavenly Clan has ever had a conflict with your Xu Heavenly Clan, no?” That middle-aged Chu Heavenly Clansman asked.

“Indeed, there were no conflicts between our clans in the past. However, now, there are. It happened thirteen days ago on the Ice Summit. A brat from your Chu Heavenly Clan offended our clan’s young master.”

“Although that brat ended up being arrested and imprisoned in the Fire Prison like he deserved, it remains that someone from your Chu Heavenly Clan actually dared to offend our young master. As such, your Chu Heavenly Clan shall pay the price,” A Xu Heavenly Clansman said.

Hearing those words, the crowd came to a realization of what had happened.

However, merely because of some minor conflict, the Xu Heavenly Clan planned to attack other Chu Heavenly Clansmen. This behavior of theirs was simply too tyrannical.

That said, the people from the Nine Dragons Upper Realm knew what sort of people the Xu Heavenly Clan were.

In terms of their own strength, the Xu Heavenly Clan might not be much stronger than the Chu Heavenly Clan. However, in terms of their reputation, they were far inferior to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After all, both Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan, two heaven-defying existences, were people that had appeared from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan was still rather weak, very few people had never heard of the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

That said, there was naturally a reason why the Xu Heavenly Clan dared to act so arrogantly. As for the reason why, it was because of the backing that they possessed, the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

At that moment, the person feeling the greatest despair would be none other than that middle-aged man from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

As matters stood, he already knew that he would not be able to escape a calamity.

“For every grievance someone is responsible, for every debt there is a debtor, if there’s something that you all wish to do, aim it at me,” Right at that moment, a figure suddenly flew down and landed before the Chu Heavenly Clansman.

The sudden emergence of a person startled everyone. That said, in terms of feeling the most shocked, it would be none other than that man from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Chu Feng, why are you here?” That man actually recognized Chu Feng.

“Senior, you recognize me?” Chu Feng also felt very surprised.

“You’re Chu Xuanyuan’s son, how could I not recognize you?” The man said.

“What? Chu Xuanyuan’s son? That Chu Xuanyuan?!”

“That guy’s name is Chu Feng. Could it be... he’s really Chu Xuanyuan’s son?”

“But, didn’t Chu Xuanyuan’s son die long ago?”

The words spoken by that Chu Heavenly Clansman brought forth a great commotion amongst the crowd. At that moment, they all began to carefully size up Chu Feng, including those Xu Heavenly Clansmen.

Sensing the ill-intended gazes that the Xu Heavenly Clansmen were looking at Chu Feng with, that Chu Heavenly Clansman immediately pulled Chu Feng behind him, and opened his arms to shield him, “This matter is unrelated to him. If I have offended you all, then come at me. Do not harm him.”

Earlier, the man was extremely nervous and somewhat cowardly when he spoke. However, his voice had grown loud and clear.

Faced with such a reaction from that man, Chu Feng was startled. A wave emerged in his heart.

Chu Feng did not know that Chu Heavenly Clansman. However, he was actually able to stand before Chu Feng during a time of crisis. This greatly surprised and moved him.

Thinking back, since he had returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Lingxi and a few others, the great majority of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen had not shown any concern or care for him. Instead, they had wanted to harm him.

As such, Chu Feng had already grown accustomed to the coldness and ruthlessness from his fellow clansmen. He had even grown accustomed to their deception and persecution of him.

As such, Chu Feng would naturally be emotionally moved to suddenly encounter a fellow clansman that was willing to protect him. This was even more so considering that that Chu Heavenly Clansman was someone that he did not know at all.

However, at that moment, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen were no longer interested in that Chu Heavenly Clansman. Instead, their eyes were fixed onto Chu Feng.

“What do you mean when you said ‘for every grievance someone is responsible, for every debt there is a debtor’ earlier?” A Xu Heavenly Clansman asked.

Seeing that, Chu Feng smiled. Then, he walked before that Chu Heavenly Clansman.

Originally, that Chu Heavenly Clansman had wanted to stop Chu Feng. However, in the end, he did not stop him.

After Chu Feng arrived before that Chu Heavenly Clansman, he looked to the Xu Heavenly Clansmen and said, “The Chu Heavenly Clansman that offended your clan’s young master on the Ice Summit is none other than I.”

“It’s you?”

“Impossible! Weren’t you captured and imprisoned? How could you get out so quickly?”

“Besides, that’s the Fire Prison of all things. Even if you managed to escape, you couldn’t possibly be completely unscathed,” The Xu Heavenly Clansmen voiced their doubt.

“There are a lot of things in this world that are beyond your imagination. You all merely need to know that the person who offended your clan’s young master was me. If you possess any grievance or hatred, aim it at me,” Chu Feng said.

“You have guts. However, I have one question that I wish to ask you.”

“That person behind you addressed you as Chu Feng. Furthermore, he said you’re Chu Xuanyuan’s son. That Chu Xuanyuan he spoke of... is it that Chu Xuanyuan?” A Xu Heavenly Clansman asked. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After that Xu Heavenly Clansman asked that question, the noisy crowd immediately grew incomparably quiet.

They all shut their mouths. It had grown so quiet that, apart from the sound of the wind, only the sound of breathing could be heard.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed onto Chu Feng, waiting for his answer.

“It is as you’ve thought, I am the rumored Chu Feng who has been expelled from the Chu Heavenly Clan many years ago, and then said to have died in the Lower Realms.”

“As for my father, he is none other than the Chu Xuanyuan that you all know of,” Chu Feng responded.

“It’s really Chu Feng? He actually didn’t die?”

“I’d actually already heard rumors that Chu Feng was still alive, and had returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan. I had originally thought it to be only rumors. Never would I have imagined that they’re actually real.”

The crowd burst into a complete uproar. It was not only the bystanders that became excited; even the Xu Heavenly Clansmen became very excited.

Chu Xuanyuan’s son. This title was no small matter at all.

Even if he were a cripple; a trash, if they could teach him a lesson, it would become something that they would be able to brag about to others.

Thus, after the Xu Heavenly Clansmen verified Chu Feng’s identity, their faces became very grotesque.

“Chu Xuanyuan’s son. Never would I have imagined that you’re actually really still alive. Furthermore, you actually came here of all places. Could it be that you’re planning to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars?”

“Regardless of what has brought you to the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, that’s actually unrelated to us.”

“However, of all the things that you should not do, you decided to offend our clan’s young master.”

“However, taking into consideration that you possess some courage, we will give you a chance today.”

“Kneel before us and apologize.”

“Then, follow me to our clan’s young master to present to him ten resounding kowtows as an apology for your mistake. Do that, and we will consider sparing the two of you.”

Sure enough, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen immediately put forth an extremely excessive demand from the get-go.

For the sake of making Chu Feng submit, they even unleashed their oppressive might to try to scare him.

However, right after those words were said, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen’s facial expressions became very ugly.

They discovered that after they spoke those words, Chu Feng did not show any sign of fear, and was instead smiling.

Faced with their threats, Chu Feng actually... smiled?
