Chapter 3277 - Bloodline Altar

“Me?”

“Senior, you are flattering me too much. I’m afraid you might be the only one who thinks this way,” Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.

“What’s this? Do you not even have this much confidence?”

“You are Chu Hanxian’s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

“How could others possibly be able to match your talent?”

“Besides, the people outside are all saying that Linghu Hongfei’s talent surpasses that of your father, that he is the most heaven-defying genius to have appeared in the history of the Ancestral Martial Starfield; do you not wish to destroy that rumor with your identity as Chu Xuanyuan’s son and make everyone realize the truth?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng was unable to help himself, and began to silently and motionlessly clench his fists. He then said, “Senior, this junior understands your intention. Regardless of what the prophecy might be, I’ll still have the people of the world realize that Linghu Hongfei is no match for even Chu Xuanyuan’s son, and simply cannot be discussed alongside Chu Xuanyuan himself.”

“Good. That’s the Chu Feng I know. That’s the Chu Xuanyuan’s son I know,” hearing such a response from Chu Feng, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded in a gratified manner.

“Oh, that’s right. Senior, where have you been during this period of time?” Chu Feng asked.

“I went to the Fang Heavenly Clan,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief answered.

“The Fang Heavenly Clan? Is something the matter?” Chu Feng asked.

“The Fang Heavenly Clan is the ruler of a neighboring Upper Realm to our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

“Between the Upper Realm ruled by the Fang Heavenly Clan and our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm is a planet. As that planet is covered in purple trees, it is called the Purpletree Ordinary Realm.

[1. Them purps!]

“There are some cultivation resources in the Purpletree Ordinary Realm. Although there aren’t a lot, those cultivation resources are precious for the fact that the Purpletree Ordinary Realm could produce them unceasingly. As such, they could be said to be pretty valuable.”

“Back when our Old Ancestor was alive, the Purpletree Ordinary Realm had always belonged to us. However, after our Old Ancestor died, the Fang Heavenly Clan proclaimed that the Purpletree Ordinary Realm belonged to them.”

“Our Chu Heavenly Clan would naturally not yield our territory to another. As such, we’ve been fighting over the Purpletree Ordinary Realm all these years.”

“When our clan is rich and powerful, the Purpletree Ordinary Realm will be under our control. When the Fang Heavenly Clan is rich and powerful, the Purpletree Ordinary Realm will be under their control.”

“Furthermore, back then, your grandfather inflicted heavy losses upon the Fang Heavenly Clan. After that one time, the Fang Heavenly Clan has never dared to set foot in the Purpletree Ordinary Realm. Because of that, the Purpletree Ordinary Realm has been under our Chu Heavenly Clan’s control all this time.”

“However, in recent years, the Fang Heavenly Clan have begun to set foot in the Purpletree Ordinary Realm again.”

“Because of a couple things, both our Chu Heavenly Clan and the Fang Heavenly Clan have cultivation resource extraction garrisons stationed in the Purpletree Ordinary Realm. However, to scramble for cultivation resources in the same world would inevitably lead to conflicts.”

“Presently, the Starfield Master Realm is willing to come out to mediate this matter for us. I had left precisely to discuss this matter,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, in that case, what was the outcome?” Chu Feng asked.

“After we debated without any fruition, the Starfield Master Realm gave a suggestion. They suggested for us to have a match with one another. The victor among us shall gain control over the Purpletree Ordinary Realm,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, could it be... you lost?” Chu Feng asked.

“That Fang Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief is merely a rank four Exalted. If I were to fight against him, how could I possibly lose?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head with a wry smile on his face.

“In that case, what happened?” Chu Feng was able to tell that the result seemed to be unsatisfactory.

“Actually, in terms of the overall strength of our clans, the Fang Heavenly Clan is weaker than our Chu Heavenly Clan. The reason why they dared to come and fight over the cultivation resources in the Purpletree Ordinary Realm in the recent years was because they had backing. As for their backing, it is an elder of the Starfield Master Realm.”

“As such, whilst the Starfield Master Realm declared that they’d come to mediate between our two clans, they’d actually come to assist the Fang Heavenly Clan.”

“As such, the match they’ve proposed is not between our Chu Heavenly Clan and that Fang Heavenly Clan, and also not between this old man and that Fang Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.”

“Instead, it would be a match among the people of the younger generation,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Younger generation?” Chu Feng’s expression changed.

“To be precise, it would be between younger generations below three hundred and sixty years of age,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Three hundred and sixty?” Chu Feng’s expression changed again upon hearing that number.

That number was too strange. There must be some sort of conspiracy behind that number.

“A genius appeared in the Fang Heavenly Clan three hundred and fifty-nine years ago. His name is Fang Hualong.”

“That Fang Hualong is truly quite powerful. Of those in his generation, our Chu Heavenly Clan truly does not possess anyone that is capable of defeating him,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“That’s bullying excessively, no? For them to make such a rule, why don’t they directly tell us to hand the Purpletree Ordinary Realm over to the Fang Heavenly Clan?” Chu Feng spoke angrily.

The Starfield Master Realm was truly too vile.

Recalling how both his grandfather and father were forced to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield because of the Starfield Master Realm, Chu Feng began to feel even more hatred for the Starfield Master Realm.

“That is the way the Starfield Master Realm does things. They won’t directly help others to snatch your possessions. However, they’ll make it so that you will have no choice but to renounce your possessions.”

“Actually, after the people from the Starfield Master Realm announced the method of settlement, I also thought that we wouldn’t be able to keep the Purpletree Ordinary Realm anymore.”

“However, after I returned to the clan and heard about your return from the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm with the cultivation of a rank five Martial Immortal, I saw a trace of hope.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng with fiery expression in his eyes. His thought was written all over his gaze: ‘high hopes.’

“Senior, what is the cultivation of that Fang Hualong?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ve heard that he is a rank six Martial Immortal. However, he’s currently in closed-door training. Likely, he will soon come out of his closed-door training. When he does, it’s likely that he will be a rank seven Martial Immortal,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“In that case, senior, when is this match arranged by the Starfield Master Realm to take place?” Chu Feng asked.

If that Fang Hualong was only a rank six Martial Immortal, Chu Feng would not place him in his eyes at all.

However, should that Fang Hualong become a rank seven Martial Immortal after coming out of his closed-door training, Chu Feng did not have absolute confidence in being able to defeat him.

As such, Chu Feng needed some time to quickly become a bit stronger.

After all, this matter concerned the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Ruling rights over an Ordinary Realm. Chu Feng did not wish for there to be any mishaps.

“It will be held in our Chu Heavenly Clan in two months’ time. At that time... the people from the Starfield Master Realm will also be present,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Two months, that soon?” Chu Feng started to frown.

“The reason why it’s two months is because that Fang Hualong is soon to exit his closed-door training,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“That’s simply too unfair,” Chu Feng spoke with great displeasure.

“Indeed, it’s very unfair. However, perhaps the heavens are also helping our Chu Heavenly Clan. After all, you’ve made such enormous progress in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng.

“Senior, should that Fang Hualong fail in making a breakthrough after undergoing that closed-door training and remain a rank six Martial Immortal, this Chu Feng absolutely will not fear him.”

“However, should he succeed and become a rank seven Martial Immortal, I would not have absolute certainty in being able to defeat him,” Chu Feng spoke the truth.

Chu Feng was able to tell how much hope the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had placed on him. Although he did not wish to lose, he also did not wish to disappoint the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“I know that this matter will be difficult for you. However, fortunately, you’ve reached the Martial Immortal realm and are now able to enter the Bloodline Altar,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Bloodline Altar, what’s that?” Chu Feng asked.

“That is a place that can only be entered by those that have become a Martial Immortal within a hundred years of age.”

“Both your father and your grandfather entered it before. Furthermore, both of them gained quite some benefit from the Bloodline Altar.”

“I believe that you will definitely be able to benefit from it too,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.
