Chapter 4479: Her Highness

Soon, several figures appeared atop the warship.

Standing at the forefront of them all were a young woman and a white-haired elder.

The white-haired elder possessed exceptional cultivation. The oppressive might that held Chu Feng in place and struck fear into the hearts of the crowd came from this elder.

As for the young woman, she had a beautiful face and an exceptional disposition. Her graceful gestures were indicative of her noble lineage. It was just that conceit and haughtiness were written on her face as well.

To be more exact, it was a condescending attitude that showed an utter lack of regard toward all that was standing before her. Rather than looking at humans, it looked like she was gazing down at mere ants.

Yet, from the moment she appeared, her eyes had never left Chu Feng at all.

“This must be a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan! She’s indeed extraordinary. The disposition she commands is completely unlike that of ordinary cultivators!”

“Chu Feng is too unlucky! Who could have thought that a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan would appear at this moment?”

In this instant, the world seemed to have fallen silent. Everyone was kneeling on the floor with their heads lowered, including the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others.

Everyone was deeply awed by the impressive personage standing before them. There were even some who had started sending voice transmissions to one another to chat.

The Nine Souls Sacred Clan was such a lofty existence that ordinary cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy wouldn’t even get a chance to meet any of their clan members in their lifetime, let alone someone of the standing of a princess.

This was also the reason why so many people were drawn to this place upon hearing that a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan would be coming here.

“Lord Princess, you must redress my grievances!” a pitiful cry suddenly sounded in the air.

It was Zhao Yuzhuo.

“You need not speak. I have seen everything clearly with my own eyes,” the young woman on the warship replied.

“Ah?”

Zhao Yuzhuo was taken aback by those words.

If the princess had seen everything clearly with her own eyes, wouldn’t that mean that she had been standing idly by the side all this while his big brother was getting killed?

This realization made Zhao Yuzhuo’s heart sink, and he felt like he had suffered a heavy impact to his chest. However, he dared not to say something.

He could only quietly accept it all.

On the other hand, the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan also didn’t bother showing any concern to Zhao Yuzhuo. Instead, she stared at Chu Feng intently as she spoke, “I was telling our elder that you are just scaring Zhao Batian, and that you wouldn’t dare to really kill him. Your guts really exceed m imagination. However, what that surprised me even more is that you actually managed to kill the Black-White Twin Malevolence too. To be honest, I’m curious to know how you managed to do it.”

“This matter started because of me; it has nothing to do with him at all. I beg of you to let him go!” Long Xiaoxiao cried out.

She was kneeling beside Chu Feng, and she kowtowed deeply to the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan as she begged for her to spare Chu Feng.

Long Xiaoxiao was the lofty princess of the Dragon Clan, and she had grown up proud and lofty. Yet, for Chu Feng’s sake, she didn’t even hesitate to kneel down and kowtow to a stranger.

Seeing this sight, Long Xiaoxiao’s parents and the others couldn’t help but feel their hearts aching for her.

But Long Xiaoxiao’s gesture simply made the eyebrows of the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to arch upward as she uttered coldly, “Chase this eyesore away.”

Shoosh!

The white-haired elder standing beside her waved his sleeves, and a powerful wind immediately gushed toward Long Xiaoxiao, brushing her away.

“Don’t hurt her! I was the one who killed Zhao Batian! If you want to settle the scores, do it with me!” Chu Feng bellowed angrily.

“Oh hoh, what a sentimental man you are!”

The princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan said as she gracefully descended from the warship a step by a step to stand before Chu Feng.

She lowered her body slightly as she assessed Chu Feng intently. Then, she said, “The Black-White Twin Malevolence are the guards that I have assigned to protect Zhao Yuzhuo. They are my men. I can let you go for killing Zhao Batian, but I can’t turn a blind eye when you have harmed my men.”

She reached out her hand and grabbed Chu Feng’s lower jaw, and her lofty gaze suddenly turned a little seductive.

“I do have some appreciation for you as a person though. There’s a way that I can let you off today,” the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan said.

“What do you want?” Chu Feng asked.

“Become my pet, like Zhao Yuzhuo, and I can spare your life,” the princess replied.

“Pet? What do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“Are my words not clear enough for you? I guess I need to be more direct then. Become a dog that barks on my command,” the princess added.

“Your Highness, you can’t! He killed my brother! That scoundrel killed my brother, and he tried to kill me earlier too!” Zhao Yuzhuo howled in anguish upon hearing those words.

“Shut your mouth!”

But Zhao Yuzhuo’s complaint only brought him the wrath of the princess.

Boom!

Another oppressive might fell from the sky, but this time, it was aimed at Zhao Yuzhuo. As if a massive mountain had fallen down on him, Zhao Yuzhuo was pressed down to the ground as well, unable to move at all.

Everyone was startled to see this sight.

There were rumors that Zhao Yuzhuo was on good terms with the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but who could have thought that he was actually no more than a dog by the princess’ side?

She had barely any regard for Zhao Yuzhuo at all! Even at the very most, Zhao Yuzhuo was nothing more than a favored slave to her!

That would explain why the princess watched quietly as Chu Feng killed Zhao Batian, not bothering to step in and interfere at all.

“Chu Feng, you mustn’t accept her offer!” an anxious voice sounded.

It was from Long Xiaoxiao.

She was knocked flying by the elder earlier on, but she managed to fly her way back here even though her aura had thinned significantly. The earlier attack from the elder had not taken her life, but she still incurred severe injuries from it.

“A shameless and persistent cockroach. Capture her!” the princess ordered.

Wua!

Long Xiaoxiao cried in agony.

The white-haired elder had exerted his oppressive might to suppress Long Xiaoxiao to the ground too.

“Don’t hurt her!” Chu Feng exclaimed. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You sure are concerned about your little lover, but you should be thinking about how you can survive right now. Like I have said, become my pet and I can consider sparing your life,” the princess said.

“Will you spare her if I accept your request?” Chu Feng asked.

“You sure care a lot about her, hm? However, I don’t permit my pets to show the slightest infidelity toward me. If you wish for me to graciously spare your life, you’ll have to kill her with your hands as a symbol of loyalty toward me.”

The princess pointed to Long Xiaoxiao as she spoke haughtily.
