Chapter 4789: A Monster We Have to Face

As soon as the spirit formation gate was formed, two silhouettes darted in. They were no other than Zuoqiu Youyu and Song Qian, who were bound together by the Yinyang Shackles.

Following them were Chu Feng and Xia Yan, Li Muzhi and Zhao Shi, and many others.

All of the disciples standing in the clearing rose into the air and rushed into the spirit formation gate leading into the Yinyang Withered Well Realm. The massive spirit formation gate was radiating blinding light, making the disciples look like moths leaping into blazing flame from afar.

They didn’t arrive in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm right away after passing through the spirit formation gate. Instead, they were first brought into a spirit formation passageway.

There was a mysterious power suffusing the passageway. This power felt like an invisible beast with keen senses, coiling tightly around the crowd as if to search for openings. If anyone were to reveal a gap, they would be immediately assaulted by this power.

It was fortunate that the Yinyang Shackles finally showed their prowess here. It amalgamated Chu Feng and Xia Yan’s auras together so as to allow them to circumvent the mysterious power’s detection.

However, Chu Feng soon realized that it wasn’t necessary to use the Yinyang Shackles to hide from this mysterious power. In truth, as long as an individual was able to control his aura and achieve a balance of yin and yang, he would be able to avoid the aggression of the mysterious power.

Of course, pulling something like that off was no easy feat, but it wasn’t too hard for world spiritists of Chu Feng and Xia Yan’s levels.

Chu Feng reckoned that the mysterious energy suffusing this passageway was more of a selection to filter off the unworthy ones. Only those who had passed the test were qualified to enter the Yinyang Withered Well Realm.

This left him wondering if the use of the Yinyang Shackles to circumvent the test was really a good idea or not. He could be missing out on something if he didn’t clear the test with his own capabilities.

“Chu Feng, have you noticed it too?” Xia Yan asked.

“Looks like you have noticed it too,” Chu Feng replied.

“Indeed. Shall we try releasing this? Something of this caliber shouldn’t pose a problem to you and me,” Xia Yan glanced at the Yinyang Shackles as she spoke.

“I’m fine with it,” Chu Feng replied.

So, Xia Yan released the Yinyang Shackles on their hands and accelerated forward. Chu Feng did the same too.

The others in the passageway were traveling in pairs, so Chu Feng and Xia Yan’s act of traveling independently immediately caught their attention.

“T-they released their Yinyang Shackles? Why are they fine after removing it?”

The crowd was bewildered.

“There’s no need for the Yinyang Shackles as long as one is able to maintain a balance of yin and yang in the body. However, those who aren’t confident in their abilities should keep the Yinyang Shackles on. Otherwise, you might risk coming under the assault of the mysterious power suffusing in this passageway.”

Chu Feng was worried that someone amidst the crowd would emulate his actions, so he explained the matter to them.

His words did enlighten the crowd. Basically, those who were strong enough were able to travel alone without the restraints of the Yinyang Shackles.

At his reminder, Zuoqiu Youyu and Song Qian quickly did the same too. With their capabilities, they were able to easily maintain a balance of yin and yang without much of an issue.

Many began to follow suit, especially the other Hidden Dragon Disciples and personal disciples. They were eager to prove themselves.

However, some of them quickly revealed looks of pain on their faces, such as Li Muzhi and Zhao Shi. Li Muzhi was still able to achieve a balance of yin and yang with a bit of effort, but Zhao Shi was clearly having difficulties.

Left with no choice, Li Muzhi had to quickly put on the Yinyang Shackles on him and Zhao Shi. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They were already some of the better faring ones. There were some who fared even worse than them.

Most of the other disciples didn’t dare to remove the Yinyang Shackles after seeing the difficulties faced by the stronger disciples, but there were always some fearless ones who thought that they could do it despite their lacking skills, and their blind confidence only resulted in a tragedy.

Those disciples who were unable to achieve a balance of yin and yang after removing the Yinyang Shackles ended up getting assaulted by the mysterious power. Their veins swelled up as blood began to flow from their seven apertures. Soon, they exploded with a bam, and their blood splattered all around in a mess.

They didn’t even get a chance to put the Yinyang Shackles back on before meeting their end.

It was only upon seeing casualties that the remaining disciples realized the danger lurking in the passageway and halted their recklessness.

Other than this mishap, it was still relatively peaceful in the spirit formation passageway.

They continued flying for around and incense’s time before they were met with another massive spirit formation gate at the other end of the passageway. Passing through the spirit formation gate, they found themselves arriving in a brand new world.

A blue sky above them, beautiful flowers beneath their feet; it was a beautiful world of nature.

It had been a long time since the disciples had seen a clear blue sky due to the calamity looming over the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, so they felt their moods lifting upon seeing this change in scenery.

Despite the terrifying reputation of the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, their immediate surroundings didn’t look too dangerous. Nevertheless, there were those who wondered if this was all an illusion and continued scanning the surroundings warily.

No one dared to make a move recklessly yet. They were still in the midst of observing the situation.

Boom!

A loud explosion suddenly sounded from the distance as the earth began to tremble.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

A series of thunderous explosions followed, and the trembling of the earth grew more and more intense. Dust could be seen rising in the distance, and upon taking a closer look, one could vaguely see a massive shadow rushing in their direction.

The mountains in the distance had to be at least ten thousand meters in height, but that massive shadow was several times taller than the mountains.

As the massive shadow approached, the disciples were finally able to get a look at its appearance. It was a black-skinned giant with a slightly plump physique and ferocious eyes. A pair of tusks reminiscent of an elephant extended from its mouth.

Rather than a human, it looked more like a gigantic monster. It was so huge that it could probably trample even the ten thousand meters tall mountains under its feet with ease.

Even the clouds in the sky only reached up to its knees. The giant had to be at least a hundred thousand meters in height.

It was still possible to see its face from a distance away, but up close, they would probably only be able to see up to its knees. Even a strand of its leg hair on it was likely to be taller than a tree.

However, the disciples were in no mood to marvel at its size, for they had realized that the giant was currently charging toward them.

“W-what is that?”

Many of the disciples flew into a state of panic as they shuddered out of fear.

This was not the first time they had seen a massive being, but the giant was simply too terrifying. While they couldn’t sense its cultivation, the pressure it exerted on them was more than enough to hint at its formidable prowess.

They felt insignificant in the giant’s presence. It felt like a spit from it could drown them, and a sneeze could tear them into shreds.

Some of the more timid disciples immediately turned tail to flee.

“Don’t move!”

However, Chu Feng sensed that something was amiss and bellowed an instruction to the disciples. It was just that the disciples were too intimidated by the approaching threat that they ignored his instruction and escaped.

Unfortunately for them, they didn’t manage to get far before being assaulted by multiple rays of light. These rays of light emerged from the spirit formation gate they had just left, and it bound their bodies tightly before dragging them back into the spirit formation gate.

Just like that, those disciples disappeared from the Yinyang Withered Well Realm. No one could tell what became of them, but there was no doubt that they had been eliminated from the trial.

The remaining crowd immediately realized that fleeing wasn’t the correct answer here and quickly headed back.

“Junior Chu Feng, did you notice something?”

The crowd asked.

After all, it was Chu Feng who tried to stop them from escaping earlier, so they thought that he might have noticed something that they had overlooked.

“I’m not entirely certain, but I can sense the formation inside the spirit formation gate eyeing us. Escape is not an option here, so we can only stand our ground... That monster is probably something which we’ll have to face,” Chu Feng said.

“Something which we have to face? You mean that we have to defeat that monster there? B-but... that’s different from what is stated in the predecessors’ records!”

While this was the first time all of them were entering the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, they chose to ask their seniors about their experiences in hopes of learning from them.

Little did they know that each batch of disciples entering the Yinyang Withered Well Realm would have different encounters.
