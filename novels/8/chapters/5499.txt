Chapter 5499: The Uncontrollable Demon Crane

“Young hero Chu Feng, you need not fear them. The Totem Phoenix Clan used to be inferior to our Totem Dragon Clan, and that’s even more so now,” Long Shanshan said.

Chu Feng chuckled. He wasn’t afraid of the Totem Phoenix Clan at all; he just wanted to know more about them.

Boom!

A rumble reminiscent of a beast’s roar echoed from afar, and it was quickly approaching the two of them.

“Young hero Chu Feng!” Long Shanshan subconsciously grabbed Chu Feng’s arm in a moment of panic.

“Prepare yourself. It’s going to be another round of body tempering,” Chu Feng said.

A crimson heat wave rushed over, causing the temperature to skyrocket. It advanced so quickly that the flames enveloped Chu Feng and Long Shanshan right as they saw it. It was so hot that Long Shanshan cried in agony despite having consumed a pain suppressant pill.

Chu Feng noticed that Long Shanshan’s body and clothes were undamaged by the flames even though her entire face was scrunched in pain. Similar to the earlier trials, the tempering had only inflicted pain and torture on them; it didn’t actually harm them.

“Bear with it. This tempering won’t claim your life,” Chu Feng instructed.

Long Shanshan gritted her teeth and stopped screaming. Her scrunched face showed that she was still in pain, but she was trying to bear it.

“Chu Feng, is this really body tempering?” Eggy asked.

“Yes, I am certain now that it’s tempering,” Chu Feng replied.

“But it’s not the type of tempering that can raise one’s cultivation or physical prowess?” Eggy asked.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Yeah, this tempering is rather peculiar. Forget it, let’s just see how it goes,” Chu Feng said.

…

Meanwhile, there was a huge commotion outside the Demon Crane. Many people were discussing fervently with anxious looks. They didn’t know what was going on inside, but more than twenty hours had passed since the juniors entered the Demon Crane.

This far exceeded the Demon Crane’s usual opening duration.

The longest the Demon Crane had ever been opened for was four hours before everyone inside was teleported out; never before had the Demon Crane remained open for twenty hours. It was understandable why those outside were worried for their juniors who entered the remnant.

“Daoist Demon Crane, what’s going on? Why isn’t the Demon Crane opening yet? Did something happen?” someone asked.

Many others had asked the same question before him too.

“Don’t worry about it, it’s a normal phenomenon,” Daoist Demon Crane replied.

“Daoist Demon Crane, are you sure the Demon Crane is still under your control?” someone finally asked the key question that everyone had been wondering about.

Daoist Demon Crane’s complexion immediately turned awful.

“It’s your own decision whether you want to enter the Demon Crane or not. There are bound to be risks inside the Demon Crane too; you’d be terribly naive to expect benefits without any risks. If you’re going to get worried just because they have been inside for a couple of hours, you should have discouraged them from entering right from the start!” Daoist Demon Crane sneered.

“Oof…”

The crowd fell silent.

They dared not to go too far since Daoist Demon Crane was no pushover, not to mention that his words made sense too. When Daoist Demon Crane first appeared in the world of cultivation with the Demon Crane, he had made it clear entering the Demon Crane came with its dangers. Only those who were bold would step into the Demon Crane.

Others soon learned that there were hardly any threats inside the Demon Crane, so more and more people became keen to enter the remnant. It eventually came to a point where most saw the Demon Crane as a place to receive free fortuitous encounters, which was why they didn’t hesitate to enter the premises.

Weng!

There was an abrupt spatial distortion, and Daoist Demon Crane vanished into thin air. The crowd thought that Daoist Demon Crane had left in a fit of anger, but the truth was that the latter had been kidnapped.

Daoist Demon Crane had been brought to the Totem Dragon Clan’s warship.

“Who is so rude to drag me here without any warning!” Daoist Demon Crane roared in anger. “T-the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief?!”

However, he soon cowered in fear when he realized that he was faced with not just the experts of the Totem Dragon Clan but even its clan chief too. As powerful as he was, there was no way he could be a match for the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, who was touted to be one of the strongest existences in the present world of cultivation.

“What a temper from Daoist Demon Crane!” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief remarked with a chuckle.

“My deepest apologies for my earlier insolence, Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. I wasn’t aware that it was you,” Daoist Demon Crane replied with a subservient attitude.

“Tell me the truth, Daoist Demon Crane. Have you lost control of the Demon Crane?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

Daoist Demon Crane quickly connected the dots and asked, “Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, could it be that the young masters and young misses of the Totem Dragon Clan have entered the Demon Crane too?”

“Yes. Chengyu and Muxi have entered the Demon Crane too,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

He had brought the Daoist Demon Crane here because he was worried about Long Chengyu and the others.

“Ah? This…” Daoist Demon Crane couldn’t maintain his composure anymore.

The experts of the Totem Dragon Clan panicked upon seeing Daoist Demon Crane’s reaction. The juniors who had entered the Demon Crane were their future, especially with the onset of God’s Era.

“It’s really no longer under your control?” Even the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief couldn’t retain his composure.

“Lord Clan Chief, I dare not hide the truth from you. The Demon Crane should have been nowhere near its usual opening time, and I wasn’t the one who brought the Demon Crane here either. It came here on its own accord. I have long lost control of the Demon Crane,” Daoist Demon Crane replied.

“Do you know the reason behind that?”

“I’m afraid not.”

“Is it possible to force the Demon Crane open?”

“I’m afraid that’s not possible either.”

“Isn’t the Demon Crane your ancestral heirloom? You don’t have a way to forcefully open the remnant?”

“It is indeed an ancestral heirloom, but my clansmen have never succeeded at establishing control over it. We have been nourishing it with our bloodline over many generations, and it’s only in my generation that we finally gained some control over it. Even so, my control is only on a superficial level.

“How ironic it is that many of my ancestors ruined their future for that, but we have never benefited from the Demon Crane before. Instead, it is the outsiders who have benefited from it. Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, I really don’t know what’s going on with the Demon Crane at the moment, and I am unable to open it either. If there’s one thing I know, the Demon Crane is currently undergoing a special phase, but I don’t know if that’s a good thing or not,” Daoist Demon Crane said as he took out a compass.

The Totem Dragon Clansmen widened their eyes upon the sight of the compass.
