Chapter 5618: Eggy’s Departure

“Eggy, you have an idea?” Chu Feng asked.

It was not that he adamantly refused to use his father’s protective formation, but that he thought that it would be a waste if it was squandered on the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven.

“Hide in the can, Chu Feng. He won’t be able to get in,” Eggy replied.

“Hide in the can? But…”

Chu Feng knew that the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven wouldn’t be able to do anything about him once he entered the can, but that wasn’t a long-term plan. The realm inside the can was fraught with danger too.

“Didn’t I tell you that I have an impression of what those things inside the can are? I still can’t remember their names, but I remember what they do. Those things harness incredible energy that I can use for my cultivation. Hide in there; I’ll absorb all of those things and ensure that they won’t be able to harm you,” Eggy said.

“Eggy, this isn’t a small matter. Are you sure you can do it?” Chu Feng asked.

He could sense how dangerous those things inside the can were. He didn’t want Eggy to take the risk unless she was absolutely confident of it.

“Trust me and enter the can now. I’ll assimilate all of it,” Eggy said.

“I’ll be entering the can then,” Chu Feng said hesitantly.

“Hurry up and enter the can. Do you think I’d lie to you?” Eggy urged.

The space inside the barrier was getting smaller, severely limiting the area Chu Feng could maneuver around. Seeing how certain Eggy was, he took out the can and first constructed a concealment formation on it before entering it.

As soon as he entered the can, those bizarre creatures emanating black light charged toward him like ferocious beasts that had found prey.

Chu Feng was already prepared for that. He immediately opened his world spirit gate, and Eggy charged out to rush at those bizarre creatures. She also began emanating an eerie black light.

Those bizarre creatures turned their attention from Chu Feng to Eggy, as if drawn to her black light. At the same time, Eggy’s black light grew even brighter, to the point where Chu Feng could hardly open his eyes.

By the time the blinding light faded, the bizarre creatures were already nowhere to be seen.

Eggy was floating in the air with her back facing him, but something was off. Cracks could be seen all over her body, as if she was no longer a person but a statue. As if that was not bad enough, the cracks were swiftly expanding.

“What’s wrong, Eggy?”

Chu Feng quickly rushed up to Eggy, but he dared not to touch her, fearing that it would worsen her condition. Eggy turned around to look at him, but this simple movement was arduous for her.

Chu Feng’s heart clenched when he finally saw her face, and tears glistened in his eyes.

Her face had turned so pale that she didn’t look like she was alive anymore. Even so, she still squeezed out a smile, but that smile was riddled with guilt.

“My apologies. I just remembered that the energy inside those creatures is extremely violent. I’m feeling a bit unwell after having absorbed too many of them, so I think I might have to leave for a while,” Eggy said.

“Don’t worry, Eggy. I can save you. I will save you.”

Chu Feng quickly released his spirit power in hopes of stabilizing Eggy’s condition, but he was so flustered that his usually fluid movements were nowhere as smooth as usual. He had always been a bold one, never showing fear even in the face of danger.

Yet, he was feeling utterly terrified right now. He could sense Eggy’s life force flowing away, and he was utterly helpless before it.

Eggy seemed to know that her end was drawing close. She continued to smile at Chu Feng to assure him, but her eyes were filled with sorrow.

“You fool, Chu Feng. You have to take care of yourself if I can’t make it. Make sure to latch onto your father if you find him. Have him protect you until you finally mature,” Eggy said.

Kacha!

Her body suddenly shattered apart. Her fragments turned into a black aura that dissipated before Chu Feng’s eyes.

Chu Feng stood on the spot in a daze, stunned. Only his breathing and his teardrops pattering on the floor could be heard. He couldn’t sense Eggy’s aura at all, be it in his World Spirit Space or this realm. It was as if she had vanished from the face of the world.

His breathing became more and more agitated. His eyes were fixated on the area where Eggy last stood, not blinking in the least.

All of a sudden, a surge of energy surged out of Chu Feng’s body. Both his hair and clothes started to flutter despite the absence of wind in this realm. An incomparably intense murderous intent enveloped the realm.

Even the surrounding space started to quake.

…

The Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven was currently standing in front of Chu Feng’s can. He had unraveled Chu Feng’s concealment formation, allowing him to see the full form of the can.

“Did he escape here? I didn’t expect him to have so many treasures.”

The compass in his hand was pointing toward this can. He wasn’t flustered despite having learned that Chu Feng had escaped into the can; if anything, he was overjoyed. He could tell that the can was a true treasure that even he would struggle to deal with.

Boom!

The can suddenly shook, and a figure flew out from within.

The Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven revealed a savage smile. The figure was none other than Chu Feng.

“I was right. You did escape there. It seems like this treasure can’t house you for long. Let’s see where you can escape this time…”

Before he could finish his words, the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven froze on the spot. A stabbing pain struck his dantian, and warm fluid started flowing down his body. He lowered his head and saw that a hand had penetrated his dantian, and the owner of the hand was Chu Feng.

“You…”

The Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven wanted to say something, but Chu Feng’s hand suddenly slit across his neck. Blood splattered everywhere.

And this was hardly the end yet.

Chu Feng’s hands barbarously clawed at the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven, pulling out fistful after fistful of flesh from his body. In just a split moment, there were only a few scraps of meat hanging from his skeletal rack.

Lying weakly on the ground, the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The latter was imbued with the power of Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, raising his cultivation by three ranks. However, that wouldn’t have been enough to astound the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven.

What truly frightened him was the fact that Chu Feng’s cultivation was still only at rank six Half-God level despite having raised his cultivation by three ranks, whereas he himself was at rank seven Half-God level.

How could Chu Feng push him so far despite being a cultivation rank weaker? This was impossible!

“You madman… I was wrong… You aren’t like your grandmother at all… You’re much scarier… But don’t you dare to get gleeful yet… You won’t live for long either… Do you think that I was the only one from the Immortal Slaughterer here? Just you wait… He’ll show you despair… Ahahahahaha!”

The Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven suddenly laughed out loud.

Chu Feng stepped forward and stomped his leg down.

Pu!

Just like that, the Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Seven’s final spark of life was stomped out.

…

Meanwhile, an aged figure in the Nine Realms Immortal Region’s forest suddenly collapsed to the ground. His dantian had been pierced, and fresh blood flowed profusely from his body.

What was shocking was that he was a True God level cultivator, a fairly strong one at that.

Yet, he stared at the person before him with eyes filled with terror and incomprehension.

“Why? Why are you treating me like this? Our Immortal Slaughterer has never antagonized your Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild, so why did you attack me?” the old man asked in confusion.

He wanted to die a knowing death, but the other party refused to grant him closure. With a cold gleam of light, a sword reaped his life.
