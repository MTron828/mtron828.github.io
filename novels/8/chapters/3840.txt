Chapter 3840 - Appearance Of Asura

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, a rainbow light arrived and landed on Meng Rufei and Zhang Duotuo.

Intense wind blew Meng Rufei to the ground. As for Zhang Duotuo, who was already lying on the ground, he was sent rolling repeatedly by the intense wind before finally stopping. His appearance was truly a sorry sight.

All of this was caused by the person who had just defeated Zhang Duotuo, the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.

That fellow was truly vile and low. Even though he had clearly already won, he still went out of his way to deliberately humiliate Zhang Duotuo.

That being said, it was obvious that he was not planning to give up with just that.

“Sure enough, you’re trash. Your daddy overstated it when I declared that I’d defeat you in an incense stick’s worth of time. Turned out, I, your daddy was able to beat you till you lay on the ground in an instant.”

“How could trash like you possibly have the guts to boast before us?”

Eleventh looked to Zhang Duotuo, who was lying on the ground, and spoke with an extremely mocking tone.

“You...”

Zhang Duotuo gnashed his teeth angrily. His complexion had turned red with anger. However, he was unable to refute Eleventh.

As the saying goes, the victor is king and the loser is the bandit. He had lost, there was no way around it.

Even if he was insulted by his opponent, he could only endure the insults.

“Headmaster Red-dress, you’ve truly not placed us, the Mystic Cave Saints, in your eyes at all. You’ve actually found such trash to represent you.”

“That said, as the saying goes, if you agree to bet, you must accept to lose. Since you’ve underestimated your opponent, you will have to pay the price for it.”

“That Spirit Formation Cultivation Bead is ours now.”

The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints extended his hand towards the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster as he said those words.

Once he said those words, the complexions of the crowd from the Red-dress Holy Land all turned green.

That Spirit Formation Cultivation Bead was their Holy Land Protection Treasure.

They were truly reluctant and pained to hand it over just like that.

“What’s this? Could it be that you all are unable to take defeat with grace, and are planning to not pay?”

“If you’re capable, then go ahead and try doing that. Did you really think that we, the Mystic Cave Saints, are easily bullied?”

Seeing that the Red-dress Holy Land was reluctant to hand over the bead, the Mystic Cave Saints became displeased.

“I, Han Xiu, have said that I am someone who will always keep my word.”

At that moment, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster stood up and opened the case in her hand.

She was really planning to hand that bead to the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Wait!”

However, right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard.

When that voice was heard, the case that the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster opened up was actually closed shut with a ‘paa.’

This scene confused everyone.

Their gazes were all focused on the case.

As for that case, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster did not close it. Instead, it had closed itself.

This completely puzzled them.

Why would the case close by itself?

Furthermore, whose voice was that?

Most importantly, that voice came from beside the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Who is it?!” the Red-dress Holy Land’s elders asked with stern voices.

After all, that place was a restricted location of their Red-dress Holy Land.

Someone actually managed to sneak their way in without them noticing it at all. This naturally caused them to be on guard.

“Seniors, I’m one of you; I’m on your side.” That voice sounded again.

“One of us?” The Red-dress Holy Land’s elders grew even more confused upon hearing that voice.

“That voice, why does it sound familiar?”

At that moment, even the Mystic Cave Saints started to look at one another. They felt that voice to be very familiar-sounding.

Merely, they were unable to think of who that voice might belong to.

It was not only them. Meng Rufei and the injured Zhang Duotuo were spinning their eyes and pondering something.

They, like the Mystic Cave Saints, also felt that voice to be very familiar-sounding.

“Buzz~~~”

At the moment when the crowd were making all sorts of guesses, the space beside the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster started to distort.

Soon, a figure appeared beside her.

Naturally, that person was Chu Feng.

“This is???”

When Chu Feng appeared, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster and elders all revealed looks of shock.

Even though Chu Feng had been at their Red-dress Holy Land for some days now, those elders had actually never met him. To them, Chu Feng was a stranger.

“Asura?”

It was instead Meng Rufei who blurted out Chu Feng’s name.

He felt extremely shocked to discover that the person who had spoken was Chu Feng.

“Asura?”

At that moment, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster and elders subconsciously turned their gazes to Yin Zhuanghong.

Although they’d never met Chu Feng, they’d heard about him.

They all knew that Yin Zhuanghong had invited over a genius. Not only did that genius possess the cultivation of an Exalted, but he was also an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. The name of that genius was Asura.

They’d actually also planned to meet up with that Asura.

After all, they should value a genius of that caliber.

Unfortunately, they had been extremely busy in recent days, and had not had the time to go meet him.

Could this person be the person Yin Zhuanghong had invited?

If that were truly the case, then this person of the younger generation by the name of Asura was truly out of the common run.

To be able to silently appear beside the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster without anyone detecting it at all, his ability was truly outstanding. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Motherfucker! Damn brat, it’s you?!”

Right at that moment, curses sounded from the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Who would’ve expected that you’re actually from the Red-dress Holy Land.”

“Strange, the Red-dress Holy Land only accepts women. Could it be that you’re a woman?”

“Well whatever, damned brat, immediately return what you’ve snatched from us! Otherwise, we will make you suffer!”

The Mystic Cave Saints were immediately furious upon seeing Chu Feng. All of them were cursing him out.

After all, what had happened in the World Spirit Mansion Gate was still vivid in their minds.

They wouldn’t forget what Chu Feng had done to them.

Because of a World Spirit Jade, Chu Feng had injured their Eleventh, and then toyed with their Eldest.

Most abominable of all, Chu Feng had set up a trap, sealed them in a spirit formation, and robbed them.

Furthermore, even though they’d clearly agreed that Chu Feng would release them should they hand over their possessions, Chu Feng did not release them at all after they’d done so.

Just recalling those things caused them extreme anger; so much so that they felt as if their hearts, livers, spleen and lungs were all about to explode.

Naturally, they would not be able to contain their emotions after seeing Chu Feng again.
