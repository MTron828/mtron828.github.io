Chapter 2784 - The Treacherous Holy Daughter

“Very well,” Chu Feng did not hesitate. He retrieved the flying insects he needed from Xia Yun’er’s flying insects and placed them into his own spirit formation.

After he gathered the required flying insects, the flying insects started to emit dazzling light. Their transformation was very obvious.

The insects were still alive and flying. However, those with good eyesight were all capable of telling that the flying insects had transformed into a living compass.

“Success! Big brother Chu Feng, you’ve succeeded. You are simply too amazing. Heavens, how did you manage to tell that these flying insects would become the key to Buried Spirit Lake once a sufficient amount of them were gathered?”

At that moment, the people that had been following Chu Feng the entire time were extremely excited. They felt it was simply a miracle.

Their reactions were understandable. After all, they had had no idea that the clues Chu Feng had obtained were related to the purple trees. That being said, even if they had obtained the clues Chu Feng had, they would not necessarily be able to realize that the flying insects were the key to Buried Spirit Lake.

“Young master Chu Feng, may I have a look?” Xia Yun’er asked. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Of course.”

Chu Feng did not think too much about Xia Yun’er’s request, and directly handed the spirit formation containing the flying insects to her.

After Xia Yun’er received the spirit formation from Chu Feng, she began to carefully size it up.

“Young master Chu Feng is truly amazing,” At that moment, Xia Yun’er revealed a brilliant smile on her face.

Her smiles were enchanting to begin with. however at that moment she was smiling brilliantly. She had completely fascinated the men present.

This was especially true for Li Xiang. Originally, his mood was very gloomy, as his cultivation had been crippled. However, after he saw Xia Yun’er’s smile, he seemed to have forgotten the fact that his cultivation had been crippled and reacted with bliss.

However, Chu Feng noticed that Xia Yun’er’s smile didn’t seem to be a smile of joy for Chu Feng, nor did it seem like a smile of joy for everyone present. Instead, she seemed to be feeling joy for herself.

That’s right, even though Xia Yun’er’s smile was extremely brilliant and enchanting, Chu Feng noticed that it was a selfish smile.

“Young master Chu Feng, give me these flying insects. As long as you give me these flying insects, the debt between us will be settled.”

Sure enough, it was exactly as Chu Feng had expected.

However, Chu Feng hadn’t expected Xia Yun’er to use the half favor that he owed her as the demand.

Chu Feng was unable to understand this. After all, even if Xia Yun’er did not make such a request, Chu Feng was still planning to bring her to Buried Spirit Lake.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that this was a unnecessary request.

In fact, it was not only Chu Feng that was confused, the others were also confused. They did not know what sort of debt was present between Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er. However, they were completely confused as to why Xia Yun’er insisted on gaining possession of those flying insects.

“Miss Xia, why do you insist on possessing those flying insects?” Chu Feng asked.

“Could it be that young master Chu Feng didn’t know that the power of Buried Spirit Lake has been growing weaker with every eruption?” Xia Yun’er asked.

“I’ve heard of that,” Chu Feng said.

“In that case, young master Chu Feng, have you heard that the fewer the amount of people there are in Buried Spirit Lake, the more comprehension one will obtain?” Xia Yun’er asked with a beaming smile.

“This is the first time I’ve heard of that.”

Chu Feng felt surprised. The others were also surprised. It seemed that it was not only Chu Feng that had never heard of that before; they too had not heard of such a thing.

“That is the truth. As such, I feel that the amount of people present here today is a bit too much,” Xia Yun’er said.

At that moment, a disciple from the Immortal Armament Villa asked, “Miss Xia, what do you mean by that?”

“Could it be that you only plan to enter Buried Spirit Lake with the people from your Starfall Holy Land? Could it be that you want to cast us away?”

They were panicking because they were afraid that Xia Yun’er would not bring them along with her.

After all, they had seen the opportunity to reach Buried Spirit Lake. If they were to miss it just like that. It would be a bit too unfortunate. None of them wanted to miss such an opportunity.

However, Xia Yun’er acted as if she did not hear their questions at all. Instead, she looked to Chu Feng and said, “It would seem that young master Chu Feng does not wish to repay the half favor that you owe me.”

“No, I merely want to know if miss Xia has considered things properly,” Chu Feng asked.

“I have,” Xia Yun’er said.

“Chu Feng, you must not do it. That is an opportunity that you’ve painstakingly obtained; how could you hand it over to her just like that?” Her Lady Queen said.

“Eggy, sooner or later, I must repay what I owe this Xia Yun’er. You also know how dangerous a person she is.”

“If I miss this opportunity to enter Buried Spirit Lake, I can always find other opportunities in the future to help me reach a breakthrough in my world spirit techniques.”

“However, if I can clear my relationship with this Xia Yun’er with this, I feel that it would be much more advantageous for me,” Chu Feng said.

“You really feel that it is more beneficial than detrimental?” Her Lady Queen asked.

Her Lady Queen still did not want Chu Feng to miss such an opportunity. After all, entering Buried Spirit Lake was an opportunity that only came along once every ten years. Her Lady Queen felt that this opportunity was very hard to come by, and was even more precious than the natural energies Chu Feng had obtained from Xia Yun’er’s spirit formation.

“I do think that it is more beneficial than detrimental,” Chu Feng said.

“Since that’s how you think, then just give it to her,” Even though Her Lady Queen was unwilling, she was still respectful of Chu Feng’s decision.

“It’s yours. From now on, I, Chu Feng, do not owe you anything anymore,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well,” Xia Yun’er nodded her head. Then, she said to Chu Feng, “Young master Chu Feng, you’ve actually lost out on this.”

“What you’ve obtained before was far inferior to this opportunity.”

Xia Yun’er actually started to mock Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was not angered by her mockery. Instead, he smiled and said, “I actually know that.”

“Since you knew, why did you still do this?” Xia Yun’er asked.

“I, Chu Feng, am not fond of owing others favors. I would feel more at ease after repaying your favor,” Chu Feng said.

“Young master Chu Feng is truly amusing,” Xia Yun’er smiled. Then, she actually walked over to Chu Feng. The distance between them was reduced to only half a meter.

Xia Yun’er placed her mouth beside Chu Feng’s ears and spoke to him in a manner akin to a voice transmission, “It is actually not a coincidence that Yuwen Tingyi found Li Xiang. It is I who told him that Li Xiang was here.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s eyes opened extremely wide. Anger emerged in his eyes.

It turned out that the reason why Li Xiang’s cultivation was crippled and he nearly lost his life was because of Xia Yun’er.

“What’s wrong? Are you angry? You couldn’t be planning to kill me, right?”

“Actually, I merely told Yuwen Tingyi Li Xiang’s location. Who would’ve thought that he would cripple Li Xiang’s cultivation? That wasn’t my intention either,” Xia Yun’er said with a beaming smile.

With Xia Yun’er saying things in such a manner, Chu Feng grew even more furious.

Xia Yun’er was truly too treacherous. The reason for that was because if Chu Feng were to attack her merely because she told Yuwen Tingyi where Li Xiang was, the justification to attack her would be too far-fetched. After all, it was not her who injured Li Xiang.

That said, Chu Feng also knew very well that had it not been for her, Yuwen Tingyi might not have been able to find Li Xiang, and Li Xiang might not have had to suffer such a calamity. All of this was caused by Xia Yun’er.

Even though Chu Feng knew this was the case, he could not do anything to her. That was the reason why he felt so furious.

That said, even though Chu Feng was feeling extremely angry, he did not explode in rage. Instead, he forcibly contained his anger. Then, he asked, “Why did you do that? There is no benefit for you in doing that.”
