Chapter 5180: Probing

“Please don’t hurt my disciple. Feel free to state any conditions you have. I’ll try my best to satisfy what you want.”

The towering silhouette had also realized that Chu Feng had no qualms about taking the lives of others, so he softened his tone considerably. From this, it could be seen that he cared deeply for his disciple. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“If you don’t want anything to happen to your disciple, you better come here and meet me in person. I’ll be waiting here for you. I suggest that you come alone and don’t pull any tricks. I can tell you right now that this barrier of yours won’t be enough to ensure your disciple’s safety,” Chu Feng said.

He was intending to use young master Wolf to coerce Old Cat into divulging Xue Ji’s whereabouts. Of course, even if young master Wolf’s master wasn’t Old Cat, he was still confident of making an escape as long as he had young master Wolf in his grasp.

“Brat, where are you right now?”

That question was directed at young master Wolf.

Young master Wolf quickly told his master his current location.

“I hope that you’ll uphold your promise. I’ll come here alone three days later,” the towering silhouette said.

“Three days it is then. If I don’t see you by the end of the third day, all that’ll be left of your disciple is his corpse,” Chu Feng replied.

After coming to an agreement, the protective formation seeped back into young master Wolf’s body, and the towering silhouette vanished.

Chu Feng could tell that the protective formation harnessed power comparable to a rank one Half-God level. There were three reasons why the towering silhouette didn’t use the power of the protective formation to deal with Chu Feng right away.

One, he wasn’t certain how strong Chu Feng was. If he failed to curb Chu Feng, his disciple would have to pay the price.

Two, young master Wolf would be left vulnerable if he used the protective formation to go on the offense. That could create a gap for Chu Feng to exploit.

Three, the protective formation was not built for offensive purposes. It wouldn’t be an effective means of dealing with Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng knew that he had to get rid of the protective formation before the towering silhouette arrived here. As long as the protective formation remained intact, he wouldn’t be able to hold young master Wolf hostage against his master.

Theoretically speaking, it was impossible for a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist to breach a protective formation from a God-cloak World Spiritist, but Chu Feng wasn’t the same person he used to be.

This was all thanks to the legacy left behind by Yue Ling’s ancestors.

He hadn’t fully grasped the legacy yet, but he had already comprehended more than half of it. That allowed him to utilize his spirit power far more effectively than before. With sufficient time, he was confident of breaching the protective formation.

“Spare me, milord! Spare me! We were blind to have dared cross you. Please forgive us for our insolence!” the two masters suddenly cried out.

After witnessing the deaths of those from the Nine Levels Pavilion, the two masters suddenly recalled everything they had said to Chu Feng earlier and realized that they were in deep trouble.

When Chu Feng didn’t answer them, they turned their sights to Yue Ling instead.

“Young miss, I’m begging you. Please tell that great person not to kill us!”

Pu!

Pu!

Before Yue Ling could say a word, the sword lodged in their bodies suddenly severed them into multiple pieces. Just like that, the two masters toppled onto the ground, dead.

“Wu! Wuuu!”

The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster turned to Yue Ling and her master and let out muffled cries. He was trying to beg for mercy too. Everyone who had offended Chu Feng earlier had lost their life. He was the only one left.

Chu Feng dared to make a move on someone as strong as young master Wolf. There was no way he would hesitate to kill him, the humble sectmaster of the weak Nameless Sect.

“Milord, can you spare our sectmaster’s life?” Yue Ling’s master asked.

“Benefactor, please spare our sectmaster. He isn’t a bad person at heart,” Yue Ling said.

“He isn’t a bad person at heart? He sold you out earlier,” Chu Feng sneered. He then softened his tone and said, “Get him to shut his mouth and I’ll spare his wretched life.”

He was only sparing the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster on Yue Ling and her master’s account. Otherwise, he would have already taken his life long ago.

“Yue Ling, you and your master should take that useless sectmaster of yours back for now. Don’t return to the Nameless Sect anymore; it isn’t safe anymore. Find somewhere else to seek refuge and send me the location,” Chu Feng said as he passed a communication talisman to Yue Ling.

“Benefactor, what are you going to do?” Yue Ling asked worriedly.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. You just have to do as I have told you to. Right, tell Elder Yuwei to wait for me in the forbidden land. I’ll find her once I’m done with my business here,” Chu Feng said.

“Alright.”

Yue Ling stowed away the communication talisman and prepared to leave with her master and the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster.

“Wait a moment.”

Chu Feng suddenly called out.

“Nameless Sect’s sectmaster, I don’t think you’re qualified for your position anymore. I suggest that you pass down your position to Yue Ling’s master if you know what’s better for you. You also better not speak a single word about me, or else you’ll have to bear the consequences,” Chu Feng said.

The corpses lying on the ground suddenly started trembling. The treasures on them and in the Cosmos Sacks suddenly flew into the air and straight toward where Chu Feng was. Their origin energies were also being forcefully drawn out from their bodies.

“Wu!”

The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster was unable to speak, but he vehemently nodded his head. Given his cowardly attitude, there was no way he would dare to go against Chu Feng’s words.

After Yue Ling and her master left together with the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster, the only ones left in the vicinity were Chu Feng and young master Wolf.

Chu Feng took out a portrait and showed it to young master Wolf.

“You!!!”

Young master Wolf’s eyes widened. Upon seeing that, Chu Feng’s eyes lit up in glee.

The person in the portrait was none other than Old Cat. Young master Wolf’s reaction had made it very clear that he did recognize Old Cat.

Chu Feng’s deduction was on the mark.
