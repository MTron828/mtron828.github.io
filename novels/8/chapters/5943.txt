Chapter 5944: Song Yun’s Decision

“Indeed. Girls know girls the best. Old folks like us have lived for so long that we struggle to grasp what girls like you are thinking. We have long forgotten about the innocence of youth,” Lord Nine Demons remarked in nostalgia.

They had come up with many plans to capture Xianhai Yu’er, but all of them were risky and would have resulted in heavy casualties. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

It was then that Song Yun proposed disguising as Chu Feng and relaying the news to Xianhai Yu’er through the spy they had in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan to lure her out.

Everyone was opposed to it, thinking it was too simple.

But Lord Nine Demons thought it was worth a try. He thought there was nothing to lose from trying it out, and it was not too late to resort to something else it failed.

Most people didn’t harbor high expectations of Song Yun’s plan, but to their surprise, she managed to lure Xianhai Yu’er to the Netherworld Sect’s ambush point.

Xianhai Yu’er was a sharp one too. She realized that something was amiss from their conversation along the way and tried to escape, though it was already too late by then.

“It’s thanks to our Netherworld Sect’s formidable Transforming Netherworld Embryo, or else my disguise wouldn’t have been so convincing,” Song Yun replied.

“The Transforming Netherworld Embryo is indeed formidable, but it also takes someone of talent to control it. Are you acquainted with Chu Feng?” Lord Nine Demons stared at Song Yun intently with a pair of deep eyes.

“I am,” Song Yun replied without any hesitation. “I am friends with Chu Feng. He helped me a lot back when I was in the Nine Souls Galaxy. Actually, he had been chosen by the Divine Vat and should have joined our Netherworld Sect too.”

“I am aware of Chu Feng’s affairs, but a mishap happened and he wasn’t able to join us. Given his current relationship with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, it won’t be to our advantage if he joins us,” Lord Nine Demons said.

“Does our Netherworld Sect fear the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Song Yun asked.

“Of course not, but there’s no need for unnecessary conflicts either. Besides, Chu Feng seems to be an obstinate person. The way he does things doesn’t match with our Netherworld Sect,” Lord Nine Demons said.

“I am his friend. I’ll try talking to him if I meet him. He might just be willing to join us. After all, he wouldn’t have to fear the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion once he has our Netherworld Sect as his backing,” Song Yun said.

“You must be on close terms with Chu Feng. Are you bringing him into our Netherworld Sect for his benefit or ours?” Lord Nine Demons asked.

“Both. Chu Feng is a talent worth nurturing, and once he becomes one of us, it’s only right for us to protect him,” Song Yun sweetly replied.

Lord Nine Demons chuckled, but he didn’t answer this question.

“Lord Nine Demons, Immortal Slaughterer’s Tu Fu requests an audience,” a Netherworld General reported from outside.

“Tell him to wait,” Lord Nine Demons replied.

“Lord Nine Demons, it’s regarding Chu Feng. He’s currently in Bluesnow Upper Realm,” another voice belonging to an old man echoed from outside.

This old man was the person whom Chu Feng had just conversed with via his protective formation, Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Two.

“Let him in.”

Lord Nine Demons waved his sleeves, and the doors opened. An old man quickly walked in.

“Miss Song Yun,” Immortal Slaughterer’s Number Two greeted Song Yun with his back bent.

Song Yun responded with a polite smile.

Number Two closed the door behind him, but his earlier report had already stirred a huge commotion outside.

Chu Feng’s name had become well-known in the present world of cultivation, such that even Netherworld Sectmembers had heard about him. They couldn’t help but wonder why Chu Feng was on the Bluesnow Upper Realm.

“Are you certain Chu Feng is in our Bluesnow Upper Realm?” Lord Nine Demons asked.

“I’m certain.”

Number Two quickly recounted his earlier encounter with Chu Feng, including how Chu Feng had just killed four of his brothers.

“You’re saying that Chu Feng used the Embryo Awakening Talisman to raise his cultivation?” Lord Nine Demons asked.

“Milord, it’s indeed the Embryo Awakening Talisman. I saw it with my own eyes. There can’t be any mistake,” Number Two replied.

“Chu Feng is so talented as to be able to raise his cultivation to rank two True God level via the Embryo Awakening Talisman?” Lord Nine Demons stroked his lower jaw contemplatively.

That was not the response Number Two wanted to hear. Lord Nine Demons seemed to be impressed by Chu Feng’s talent instead.

So, Number Two kneeled and exclaimed, “Lord Nine Demons, we brothers only got a chance to join the Netherworld Sect thanks to your support. We have always been thankful to you for that, and the last thing we would want is to add to your trouble. However, four of my brothers have been killed by Chu Feng. I can’t just turn a blind eye to it. Lord Nine Demons, I implore you to stand up on our behalf.”

Number Two kowtowed nonstop afterward.

“Tu Fu, our Netherworld Sect has nothing against Chu Feng. Why are you dragging your grudge into our sect? Did you join our Netherworld Sect to use us to deal with Chu Feng on your behalf?” Song Yun asked.

“Miss Song Yun, what are you saying?! We brothers are loyal to the Netherworld Sect! We have never intended to exploit the sect to deal with Chu Feng. But it’s different when Chu Feng came knocking on his own, and he still showed no mercy despite me having relayed to him that we are Netherworld Sectmembers,” Number Two argued.

“It’s no secret that your Immortal Slaughterer has a grudge against Chu Feng. You brothers massacred the sect of Chu Feng’s grandmother. Anyone else in his place wouldn’t have let you off. Why are you trying to drag our Netherworld Sect into this?” Song Yun asked.

“Miss Song Yun, you can’t say that.”

“Enough. I’ll decide what to do,” Lord Nine Demons said.

“This...”

Number Two’s complexion looked awful. He had a feeling that Lord Nine Demons wasn’t going to stand up for them.

None of their brothers could take having the Netherworld Embryo planted in them, so they were treated with derision in the Netherworld Sect despite their high cultivation level. The Netherworld Sect thought of them as outsiders.

“Bad news, Lord Nine Demons!” Another Netherworld General suddenly reported from outside. He was Lord Nine Demons’ aide.

“Come in and talk.”

Lord Nine Demons opened the doors, and the Netherworld General closed them after entering.

The Netherworld General took out a map and said, “Lord Nine Demons, our formation has detected a teleportation formation, presumably from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. We sealed it off as soon as we found it. However, all of our sectmasters in the vicinity have been massacred. I’m guessing that not all of the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen fell for our ploy; they must have dispatched a group into the Bluesnow Upper Realm too.”

“Oh?” Lord Nine Demons’ eyebrows shot up.

“Milord, that place is close to where my four brothers were killed. Could Chu Feng be behind it? No, I’m certain it must be Chu Feng. Everyone knows that he’s on close terms with the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. He would have offered a helping hand when he learned that Xianhai Yu’er had been captured.

“I was still wondering why Chu Feng would suddenly appear in Bluesnow Upper Realm. I’m certain we didn’t leave any trails for him. It all makes sense now. He came to Bluesnow Upper Realm to save Xianhai Yu’er, only to meet us by coincidence,” Number Two exclaimed.

He knew deep down that the Netherworld Sect wasn’t going to get involved in their grudge, but if he could tie Chu Feng and Xianhai Yu’er together, the Netherworld Sect would have no choice but to suppress Chu Feng.

“Lord Nine Demons,” another voice echoed outside.

“Come in.” Lord Nine Demons summoned the person in.

That person kneeled on the ground and reported, “Lord Nine Demons, our brothers in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan have relayed news over. All of the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen have fallen for our trap. Xianhai Shiyue led all their elites into Littlelight Upper Realm. However, Jie Ranqing’s son, Chu Feng, is with them, and he alone chose to enter Bluesnow Upper Realm.”

“He’s the culprit?” Lord Nine Demons narrowed his eyes with murderous intent.

“See! I knew it must have been him. Not only did he kill my brothers, but he also murdered so many Netherworld Sectmembers. We can’t let him get away with that!” Number Two said.

The other Netherworld Generals present also revealed their killing intent.

Only one person remained calm—Song Yun.

“Where’s the evidence? Can you prove that Chu Feng was the one who killed our sectmembers? Did you see it with your own eyes?” Song Yun asked.

“Miss Song Yun, there’s no need for definitive evidence; the situation is clear enough. Our spy in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan stated that only Chu Feng has entered Bluesnow Upper Realm. Who else could have killed those sectmembers aside from him?” Number Two said with a much more confident tone.

“Men, relay a kill order for Chu Feng,” Lord Nine Demons ordered. He took out a token inscribed with the words ‘Nine Demons’.

Song Yun was taken aback. Lord Nine Demon’s kill order was not to be made light of. It would put Chu Feng in an extremely precarious position.

Unlike Xianhai Yu’er, Chu Feng didn’t have any backing. He wouldn’t stand a chance against the powerful Netherworld Sect.

Song Yun fell into a dilemma, but just as the Netherworld General was about to leave after accepting Lord Nine Demon’s token, she made up her mind and spoke up, “Wait, I can prove that Chu Feng wasn’t the one who killed those people.”

“You can prove it?” Everyone, including Lord Nine Demons, was taken aback.

What Song Yun said next further shocked them.

“I was the one who killed them.”
