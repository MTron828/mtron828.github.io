Chapter 3367 - The Branch Clan’s Conspiracy

Wuming Fenghuo knew very well that they could not provoke Chu Xuanyuan anymore. They, the Starfield Master Realm, must pull back while he was still not angered.

That said, Wuming Fenghuo also knew very well that he would not be able to prevent his foolish clansmen from doing stupid things.

Perhaps everyone had heard of Chu Xuanyuan’s past achievements before. However, not everyone knew how powerful he was.

It was not only them, the people from the Starfield Master Realm that did not know of Chu Xuanyuan’s might, but a lot of people in the Ancestral Martial Starfield did not know about Chu Xuanyuan’s might.

In fact, there were a lot of people that questioned his accomplishments, and believed them to be lies and exaggerations.

Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been so many people comparing Linghu Hongfei to him.

Those who actually knew about Chu Xuanyuan knew that while Linghu Hongfei was indeed very talented, he would not even be qualified to carry Chu Xuanyuan’s shoes.

Unfortunately, there were too many foolish people in the world, too many people that believed themselves to be infallible.

Back then, Wuming Fenghuo had already tried his hardest to persuade his clansmen to not make an enemy of Chu Xuanyuan and the Chu Heavenly Clan.

He felt that, with Chu Xuanyuan’s personality, if they were to befriend him, he would definitely not make their Starfield Master Realm an enemy even if he were to become powerful in the future.

However, at that time, he was deemed to be a coward, a joke, by a lot of people in the Starfield Master Realm.

Everyone felt that he was exaggerating Chu Xuanyuan’s capabilities and demoralizing their clan. There were even people that called him a traitor, and demanded that he be severely punished!!!

Fortunately, the Wuming Clan’s Clan Chief, the current Fieldmaster of the Starfield Master Realm, Wuming Doutian, was a perspicacious individual.

Wuming Doutian had never looked down on Chu Xuanyuan. However, he did not believe that befriending Chu Xuanyuan before he matured would guarantee that he would not become their, the Starfield Master Realm’s, enemy.

As a man of ambition, as the master of the Starfield Master Realm, as the Fieldmaster of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Wuming Doutian only believed in himself.

Thus, he decided to suppress Chu Xuanyuan like they had suppressed Chu Hanxian.

That was the reason why those things from back then happened.

As matters stood, it had been proven that their decision back then was a mistake.

True dragons could not be suppressed. As for Chu Xuanyuan, he was a true dragon.

However, so what if Chu Xuanyuan was a true dragon? Wuming Fenghuo knew very well that even if he were to return to the clan and explain to the clansmen how serious the matter was, there would likely not be a lot of people that would believe him.

What happened back then would happen again.

Powerless. The current Wuming Fenghuo was as powerless as he was back then.

“Heh...”

Suddenly, Wuming Fenghuo chuckled.

It was a laughter of helplessness. He not only found himself to be laughable in apologizing to Chu Xuanyuan when he didn’t even know if he was present, but more than that, he felt his powerlessness to be truly laughable.

Even though he knew with certainty that such a path would lead to disaster, he was unable to prevent his clan from proceeding down that path. That sort of powerlessness made him feel despair.

With a bitter smile on his face, Wuming Fenghuo slowly got up and then disappeared into the night sky.

His back view was so very lonely, so filled with worries.

......

Chu Feng had no knowledge about the conversation between Wuming Fenghuo and Wuming Gangxiong.

He also did not know that his return had put such enormous pressure upon Wuming Fenghuo.

After traveling for some time, Chu Feng and Bai Liluo had arrived at the Scarlet Province Upper Realm ruled by the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

When Chu Feng and Bai Liluo exited their teleportation formation, they immediately saw a group of Wuma Heavenly Clansmen.

However, that group of Wuma Heavenly Clansmen had fiery eyes and ice-cold expressions.

Even though they had the title plates of the Wuma Heavenly Clan on their waists, they were wearing different outfits than Wuma Shengjie and the others. Furthermore, their cultivation was also stronger than the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen that Chu Feng had seen.

Chu Feng’s heart sank the moment he saw those people.

He immediately realized that those Wuma Heavenly Clansmen were not from the Wuma Heavenly Clan that ruled over the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.

Instead, they were from the branch clan.

What Chu Feng was worried about the most had occurred.

“We’ve actually arrived late. Big sister Liluo, we must hurry,” Chu Feng looked to Bai Liluo.

Bai Liluo tacitly understood Chu Feng’s intention. She grabbed Chu Feng and, with a loud bang, they disappeared from where they stood.

Due to Bai Liluo’s astonishing speed, a burst of violent wind was lifted up by her, sweeping across the surroundings.

Not only were the bystanders affected by the wind, but even the Wuma Branch Clan’s clansmen were overturned by the sudden violent wind.

“Milord, what has happened?”

The branch clansmen all got back up in succession and arrived before an old man.

The old man was not only someone from the Wuma Branch Clan, but he also possessed a cultivation of rank three Exalted. In the branch clan, he was someone with status and power.

However, even that old man was actually overturned by the violent wind that had suddenly appeared. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Although the violent wind did not have much destructive force, one could tell how formidable it was.

“It was those two people from earlier,” The old man said after a glance at his surroundings.

“Two people from earlier?”

The people from the Wuma Branch Clan immediately realized that something was amiss upon hearing those words.

The reason for that was because they also noticed that everyone else was present, with the exception of the two people that had just exited the teleportation formation.

However, they did not manage to see the appearance of Chu Feng and Bai Liluo.

The reason for that was because the two of them were both in disguise.

Chu Feng was not a coward. However, it remained that he was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. As such, he must consider the Chu Heavenly Clan’s safety. Thus, he had never planned to expose his identity from the start.

“Milord, why would such experts suddenly appear here?”

“Could it be helpers requested by those trash?” The branch clansmen asked worriedly.

The trash that they spoke of was naturally the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen.

They refused to address those Wuma Heavenly Clansmen as Wuma Heavenly Clansmen. If they were to address them as such, they would be admitting to the fact that they belonged to the branch clan.

As such, they would always address the people from the main clan as trash.

“Even if they are, there’s no need to be afraid.”

“We have come prepared. If anyone dares to meddle with this matter, they will be courting trouble for themselves,” The old man said.

“That’s true. After all, we have asked that lord to come,” The branch clansmen laughed complacently.

“Quiet down. Not everyone knows that we’ve asked that lord to come. Do not make irresponsible remarks!” The old man warned.

“Yes, Milord. We were wrong,” The branch clansmen immediately apologized.

“Handle your tasks properly. Even if that lord is present, we must still do what we need to do,” The old man reminded them.

“Yes, Milord.”

The branch clansmen returned to their positions. One of them also sent out news of what had happened.

The reason why they were stationed there was precisely to immediately transmit news should they discover something amiss.

Even though they’d already discovered two suspicious individuals, the old man was still completely confident.

“All you trash, none of you will be able to escape. We will now completely return the humiliation you all have brought upon our seniors of the past,” The old man muttered with a quiet voice.

Both his eyes and his words were filled with hatred.
