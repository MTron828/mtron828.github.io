Chapter 5201: Who’s Talking

“I know that you’re strong, Xue Ji, but these Asura God Stones are important to me too. If you wish to have them, I can give some to you in view of our past relationship. However, I won’t stand for it if you wish to monopolize them,” Chu Feng said.

“What use are these Asura God Stones for a martial cultivator like you? You’re merely saving them up for that girl. Since you refuse to yield, I’ll just have to force you into it. However, I’ll make things clear first—if you get nicked by my sword, there won’t be any antidotes this time around. Think carefully, Chu Feng.”

Drawing her black sword, Xue Ji’s eyes turned indescribably cold. She emanated such a terrifying air that one could mistake her for a Goddess of Massacre.

“I’ve already thought things through,” Chu Feng replied.

“Prepare to die then.”

With her sword in hand, Xue Ji charged at Chu Feng.

Shoosh!

Chu Feng also brandished his sword the moment Xue Ji made a move.

Whoosh!

A violet tempest carrying a dragon’s roar rushed at Xue Ji. Before the prowess of the tempest, Xue Ji looked weak and insignificant.

This was rank six Exalted Taboo, Roar of the Wind Dragon. It was one of Chu Feng’s stronger means.

He had no intentions of holding back this time around.

“Hmph!”

Xue Ji harrumphed in the face of the violet tempest, but her charge didn’t slow in the least. Instead, she swung her sword outward and released a massive arc of black sword qi. It sliced right through the violet tempest, dissipating it.

To make things worse, the black sword qi didn’t stop at just dissipating the violet tempest. It continued on its trajectory toward Chu Feng.

“She really can’t be underestimated.”

Even though Chu Feng had known that Xue Ji had powerful means up his sleeves, he was still surprised to see Xue Ji slicing through his Roar of Wind Dragon so easily. Naturally, this meant that he had to get serious.

Boom!

A loud explosion echoed beneath Chu Feng’s feet, and there was a sudden flash of red light. By the time the light vanished, Chu Feng was already nowhere to be seen.

As a result, the black sword qi landed empty.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

More explosions ensued, and they were accompanied by a flash of red light each time.

This was the Exalted Taboo Martial Skill Chu Feng had obtained from the Holy Valley, rank seven Exalted Taboo Storm Dragon Footwork.

Storm Dragon Footwork was a skill that induced a thunderous rumble with each step he took. It was weaker than other rank seven Exalted Taboo Martial Skills, but it was nevertheless an outstanding movement skill.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

However, Xue Ji also had plenty of combat experience too, allowing her to adapt to different situations. Faced with the nimble-footed Chu Feng, she chose to predict his movements and release a series of black sword qi to where he would land. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

If Chu Feng were to travel in a straight path, he would definitely be struck by her black sword qi.

However, his footsteps were simply too unpredictable that her black sword qi fell empty.

“Why is your face so red? Is it tiring running around?”

Despite having her attacks evaded by Chu Feng’s Storm Dragon Footwork, Xue Ji wasn’t anxious in the least. Instead, she started teasing him.

Chu Feng’s face was indeed getting redder and redder.

Grar!

All of a sudden, Chu Feng turned toward Xue Ji. He opened his mouth and released a powerful sonic boom toward her. Not only was the sonic boom visible, but there was even the silhouette of a massive dragon head too.

This was another rank seven Exalted Taboo that Chu Feng had picked up from the Holy Valley, Storm Dragon Obliteration.

Through channeling his air into his dantian, he could release the voice of the dragons to launch a deadly offense. The prowess of Storm Dragon Obliteration would be further increased when used in unison with Storm Dragon Footwork.

In other words, the prowess of his roar was much stronger than ordinary rank seven Exalted Taboos. It dissipated Xue Ji’s black sword qi all at once.

“Hmph!”

Yet, Xue Ji merely revealed a cold smile in response.

A glint flashed across her eyes, and she opened her mouth wide. Black gaseous flame gushed out from her mouth, morphing into a terrifying black face that collided with the dragon’s head.

Boom!

Astonishingly, when the two forces collide, Storm Dragon Obliteration was the first one to crumble. The terrifying black face broke down as well, but its remnants morphed into a rain of black sword qi that rushed straight at Chu Feng.

The rain of black sword qi covered such a huge area that it was impossible to dodge them even with Chu Feng’s Storm Dragon Footwork.

Seeing that, Chu Feng chose not to dodge anymore. He stood his ground and got into a peculiar sword drawing stance. It was just a mere stance, but the air around him changed right away.

Shoosh!

He swung his sword outward.

Boom!

Terrifying black flames reminiscent of hellfire flooded out of the Immemorial Hero’s Sword, threatening to destroy everything in its path. Even the rain of black sword qi was reduced to cinders before it could even come close.

This was another skill that Chu Feng had picked up from the Holy Valley, rank eight Exalted Taboo Hellfire Quick Draw. It was a skill created by the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor.

The black flames swiftly flooded in and devoured Xue Ji. Her aura disappeared without a trace.

“Did I go too far?”

A tight knit formed between Chu Feng’s eyebrows as it was not his plan to kill Xue Ji. How could he explain things to Yu Sha if he accidentally took her life?

However, this couldn’t be helped either. Xue Ji’s earlier attack was so powerful that the only attacks that could counter them were his Hellfire Quick Draw and the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.

The Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes was too powerful and came with a strong backlash, which was why he opted for the Hellfire Quick Draw instead.

All of a sudden, a vacuum appeared in the middle of the black flames. Xue Ji gracefully walked out from within. She was completely unharmed, not having lost even a single strand of hair.

“Chu Feng, you’re indeed adept at using your martial skills. I am impressed by your skills. With the means you have just displayed, there should be hardly any cultivators in the same rank who can rival you. Unfortunately, your opponent is me, and I am not just anyone,” Xue Ji replied.

“If you are not just anyone, who are you then?” Chu Feng asked.

“You can ask Yu Sha if you wish to know, but I’d advise you not to. Otherwise, you’ll dearly regret having lost me,” Xue Ji said.

“Then I’ll make sure to ask about it,” Chu Feng said.

“Why?” Xue Ji was intrigued by his answer.

“It has been far too long since I have regretted anything. It’d be a good experience,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

Xue Ji’s face turned wintry.

“Chu Feng, I am not in a mood to play around with you.”

Right after saying those words, her eyes turned completely pitch-black.

Boom!

Her hair began to flutter, and black gaseous flame poured out from her body. It first devoured Chu Feng’s black flame before morphing into an army of mounted lancers behind her. Every single one of these mounted lancers emanated a powerful aura.

However, the one who was the most terrifying of all was still none other than their commander, Xue Ji.

Chu Feng could tell right away that this was a powerful offensive means that surpassed even rank eight Exalted Taboo Martial Skills.

“Chu Feng, I’ll give you one last chance. Will you accept your death or be used by me?” Xue Ji asked.

“Xue Ji, I didn’t want to hurt you, but I have no plans of backing down here.”

Chu Feng tightened his grasp on his Immemorial Hero’s Sword. He knew that none of his other means could curb Xue Ji anymore, and his only resort was Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.

While he had been warned not to use the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes or he might risk irreversible damage to his own body, a thousand complete Asura God Stones were at stake here. No matter what it took, he had to get his hands on them for Eggy’s sake.

It was then that a sweet but indescribably nostalgic voice echoed from Chu Feng’s World Spirit Space.

“Hey, what are you doing? Didn’t they tell you that you can’t use this means anymore? Are you trying to die?”

Chu Feng’s heart clenched when he heard his voice, and his body soon began to quiver.

The Asura World Spirit Army had been sealed and Yu Sha was currently in closed-door cultivation. Who else could be talking to him then?

But there was no need for guesses here. Chu Feng already knew whom the voice belonged to the moment he heard it.
