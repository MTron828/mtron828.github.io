Chapter 5693: Massacre in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion

The pressure coming from the Immemorial Bloodline Stone was already unbearable under normal circumstances, and the pressure only further intensified when someone possessing a bloodline induced a phenomenon.

And Chu Feng had unleashed both his martial and world spiritist bloodlines at the same time.

The avatars manifested from his bloodlines gushed into the clouds and beyond, covering a vast space that wasn’t limited to just the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion or even the Seven Realms Galaxy.

…

Somewhere in the vast world of cultivation, an old man was riding on a shabby little boat across space. He was cultivating when he suddenly opened his eyes and looked in the direction of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

His dull eyes slowly lit up as he peered across starfields and galaxies. Shock seeped into his old eyes, which had witnessed many eras.

“What formidable bloodlines,” the old man remarked.

A young man pried open the curtains and walked in. It was Zhang Yingxiong.

“What’s happened, master? What powerful bloodline?” Zhang Yingxiong asked out of curiosity.

“A formidable fellow has appeared,” the old man said.

“Who? Where?”

“Come, follow me to the Seven Realms Galaxy.”

The boat warped into a streak of light as it traveled toward the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion at an inconceivable speed. It was just a shabby wooden boat, but its speed far surpassed that of ordinary teleportation formations.

…

In the Nine Souls Galaxy, a middle-aged man was seated at the edge of a cliff, wiping a seemingly ordinary axe with a gleaming golden cloth.

.

All of a sudden, he stood up and looked in the direction of the Seven Realms Galaxy. He focused his powerful martial power inside his eyes as a green aura rose from his body. What was shocking was that this green aura was even more formidable than his martial power.

Astonishment surfaced in his eyes, and it only deepened with time.

Just then, a ten-year-old boy happily ran toward the cliff and exclaimed, “Master, Miaomiao just made another breakthrough!”

“Mm,” the middle-aged man replied, but his eyes remained fixed in the same direction.

“I didn’t expect Miaomiao to fuse so impeccably with the Soul Fog. At this rate, the strongest prodigy in the world of cultivation won’t be those juniors of those galaxy overlords anymore,” the boy said excitedly, but he quickly noticed that the middle-aged man wasn’t reacting at all. “Master, what are you looking at?”

He thought that his master would have been delighted to hear about Xian Miaomiao’s breakthrough, but the latter wasn’t responding at all. This confused him. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I don’t think Miaomiao has a chance at becoming the strongest prodigy in the world of cultivation anymore,” the middle-aged man said.

“Ah? How can you be sure of that?” the boy asked.

“Take a look at it yourself.” The middle-aged man pointed his finger at the boy and transferred a surge of his martial power mixed with the green aura into the latter’s eyes.

“…” The boy was so shocked that he couldn’t even speak.

It was only till the energy in his eyes dissipated that he finally turned to the middle-aged man and said, “Master, what terrifying lightning that is! Where is it from?”

The middle-aged man didn’t reply, but the boy grasped it on his own accord and asked aloud, “It can’t be a phenomenon induced by someone’s bloodline, can it?”

Goosebumps rose all over his body. If it really was a human-induced phenomenon, it would be an existence that no junior in the world could rival.

…

Powerhouses from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, Totem Galaxy, Immortal Sea Galaxy, Heavenly Dome Galaxy, Bloodline Galaxy, and Divine Body Galaxy cast their gazes in the direction of the Seven Realms Galaxy, or more specifically, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

They had all seen the humongous phenomenon.

At the center of the phenomenon were two lofty bloodlines wreaking havoc upon the world. Before them, all beings were no different from ants.

Pained expressions appeared on the faces of the living beings beneath. The tremendous pressure crushed everyone except for Chu Feng. Even the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster and Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had knitted eyebrows, whereas the Saint-tier elders were clenching their teeth.

The juniors behind had distorted faces and were trembling nonstop.

The Ruler’s Bloodline crushed their souls, whereas the nine-colored lightning domineeringly sought to destroy everything in its path.

Those who could withstand the pressure looked at the figure at the center of the square—Chu Feng. He was the one who had caused this fuss.

Even the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster saw Chu Feng in a different light. Enmity could be seen in his eyes. He was just a bystander in the grudge between Chu Feng and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but he knew that no one would stand a chance against Chu Feng if he was left to mature.

Kacha! Kacha!

Cracks echoed beneath Chu Feng’s feat. His bloodline powers were so strong that the Immemorial Bloodline Stone was unable to withstand his prowess. It was reaching its limit.

Then, the Immemorial Bloodline Stone cracked apart with a loud ‘bam’. The phenomenon began to slowly dissipate, but the pressure had already disappeared.

Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion breathed a sigh of relief. In particular, the juniors felt as if they had gained a new life. However, none of them could raise their spirits when they looked at Chu Feng. Their minds had gone blank as their hearts filled with an indescribable emotion.

Jie Ranqing’s son was a possessor of the Ruler’s Bloodline?

This was already hard for them to accept, but what was with that Heavenly Lightning Bloodline? They had never seen anything as frightening as that. Even the Ruler’s Bloodline paled in comparison to it.

And these two bloodlines came from Chu Feng?

Had it not been for Chu Feng, they would have never known that the Immemorial Bloodline Stone could test for bloodlines other than the Ruler’s Bloodline, as long as the bloodline was strong enough.

Chu Feng coldly swept his gaze across the angry but frightened members of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. His eyes stopped on the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, and he said, “Did you see that clearly? I’d like to ask whom my father is unworthy of in the world of cultivation?”

Everyone from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion felt their hearts tightened.

If Chu Feng had inherited that Heavenly Lightning Bloodline from his father, it would mean that his father was a prodigy on par with Jie Ranqing. In terms of bloodlines, if Jie Ranqing was the king of the world spiritists, Chu Feng’s father would be the king of the cultivators.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master furiously glared at Chu Feng with clenched jaws, not saying a word. Now that he was taking a closer look, there was some resemblance between Chu Feng and his daughter, but he had never associated Chu Feng with the grandson he had never met.

He had always thought that his grandson was lowly trash, and that anyone who was remotely talented couldn’t be his grandson. However, the truth was already shoved into his face.

The only thing that jarred him was the occasion. Why did it have to happen now?

It was under God’s Era prophecy that Chu Feng was compelled to display his talents.

The more he thought about it, the more his rage seethed. It was slowly consuming him.

Pu!

All of a sudden, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master spurted a mouth of blood.

“Lord Mansion Master!”

Many experts concernedly rushed up to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. It had only been an instant, but he looked as if he had aged decades. Seeing the fearless and indomitable Mansion Master trembling uncontrollably left the elders feeling sour.

Ling Mouzi turned to Chu Feng with tremendous murderous intent in his eyes as he ordered, “Take down Chu Feng!”

Countless guards rushed forth from all directions to encircle Chu Feng. Every one of them was much stronger than Chu Feng, but they suddenly froze in the middle of their movements before they could reach him.

Ling Mouzi and the others quickly took a closer look, and they were taken aback.

A layer of starlight energy harnessing incredible spirit power was enveloping Chu Feng. This was the power that was keeping the guards at bay.

“Small fries like you dream of catching me?”

With a wave of Chu Feng’s arm, the starlight energy rippled outward with destructive might, instantaneously disintegrating the guards into bits.

The crowd couldn’t believe it. Chu Feng was massacring their people!
