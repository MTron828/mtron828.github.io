MGA: Chapter 1745 - Army Of Martial Emperors

“Don’t be afraid, that’s merely a mechanism,” Long Lin said with a light smile.

“Mechanism?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng and the others were all surprised. What sort of mechanism would be able to create existences this powerful? These were Martial Emperor-level experts!

Furthermore, judging from their appearance, they should have existed for countless years, and seemed to be existences that would never die.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, Lon Lin waved his sleeve, and a golden light swept toward Chu Feng.

Chu Feng raised his hand and caught the golden light. Then, he opened his palm and discovered that it was a golden title plate.

Seeing the golden title plate in his hand, Chu Feng’s pupils shrunk. While this title plate seemed to be made out of pure gold, it felt as heavy as a mountain when held. Furthermore, it emitted a sort of intimidating sensation that reached the soul. This was most definitely not an ordinary title plate.

“With that title plate in your hand, they will not harm you. Help me with one thing. Go to the first palace hall of this place and take out ten golden arrows for me. If you do that, I’ll keep my promise and release Yao’er and bestow you the fruit,” Long Lin said as he pointed at the floating golden palace.

“This doesn’t seem to be within the extent of the promise before,” Baili Xuankong said.

Long Lin ignored Baili Xuankong and acted as if he had never heard anything. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng and said, “You can refuse to do it.”

Chu Feng looked at the title plate in his hand and then looked at the ten thousand golden-armored soldiers filled with killing intent outside of the golden palace. Then, he took a glance at Yao’er, who was standing behind Long Lin and looking at him. Then Chu Feng said, “I’ll go.”

“Chu Feng, that palace is too dangerous. The dangers that I’m talking about are not those golden-armored soldiers. Rather, it’s the inside of that palace. In there is the aura of some unknown being. It is a power that even I do not dare to face.”

At this moment, Baili Xuankong grabbed onto Chu Feng. He did not want him to bear this risk. The reason for that was because he felt a very frightening aura from that palace.

“That’s right. Chu Feng, you absolutely cannot enter. He is simply not having you help him. Instead, he’s trying to kill you,” Dugu Xingfeng said.

Yin Chengkong and Guan Hong also nodded their heads to indicate that what Dugu Xingfeng said was very true.

“Aura?” After hearing those words, Chu Feng looked toward the inside of the palace, and discovered that there was indeed a special existence there. However, Chu Feng did not feel any fear from it.

“Do you all know why I wanted Chu Feng to enter? The reason for that is because that palace is not a place that anyone can enter as they wish. Regardless of how high your cultivation might be, if your talent is extremely poor, you’ll still be killed upon entering.”

“However, if your talent is exceptionally high, even if your cultivation is a bit weak, you will still be able to enter it easily. At the very least, the first palace hall will not be an issue. Thus, you all should stop trying to use your own perceptions to warn Chu Feng. The reason for that is because your perceptions are simply different,” Long Lin said mockingly.

“You...” Baili Xuankong and the others were naturally displeased by those mocking words. However, after considering it, they had nothing to say, and dropped the subject.

After all, judging from Chu Feng’s appearance, he really seemed like he did not feel the danger that they felt from the palace. Else, he would not be this calm.

“Ancestor, it seems that we have no other choice. Furthermore, I feel that this senior will not try to harm me for no reason or cause. Since I’ve already come, I might as well help him,” Chu Feng said.

“Go ahead. But, make sure to be careful and not force yourself,” Baili Xuankong said.

“This disciple understands,” As Chu Feng spoke, his body shifted, and he flew toward the palace.

“Pull back!!!”

Once Chu Feng approached the palace hall, the thousand golden-armored soldiers shouted loudly. Then, they pulled the spears in their hands back, and stood to either side of the entrance in an orderly manner. At the same time they did that, the defensive formation also disappeared.

Just like that, Chu Feng entered the palace. Upon entering the palace, Chu Feng’s gaze grew serious, and his heartbeat started to accelerate.

Inside the palace was another world. It was much more spacious than it looked from the outside.

Furthermore, the inside of the palace was filled with golden-armored soldiers. They stood in orderly rows on both sides of the palace hall, leaving only a red carpet-covered path between them.

These golden-armored soldiers were slightly different from the ones outside. Some held spears, some held blades, and some held both blades and shields.

In addition to that, there were a hundred golden-armored soldiers that were nearly a hundred meters tall. They held enormous hammers, and were riding on enormous monstrous beast-like stone statues. They were extremely domineering.

As far as the eye could see, there were several tens of thousands of golden-armored soldiers in this palace hall.

Even though Chu Feng was unable to sense their auras, Chu Feng felt that they were, at the minimum, all Martial Emperor-level existences.

In fact, many among them were above rank two Martial Emperor. This was especially true for those hundred golden-armored soldiers mounted on top of the monstrous beast statues.

Even though they were not moving at this time, and looked as if they were petrified, one could tell how ferocious they were just by looking at their outward appearance. The hundred of them were most definitely not ordinary Martial Emperors.

An army of several tens of thousands of Martial Emperors, if they were to charge toward the Overlord Domain, likely the Four Clans, Three Palaces and even the Ancient Era’s Elves would have to submit to them.

The reason for that was because their battle strength was truly too frighteningly powerful.

“The Ancient Era, exactly how strong and powerful were the existences of that era?”

Chu Feng began to ponder. He felt that this palace was a product of the Ancient Era, and that these golden-armored soldiers should also be a product of the Ancient Era.

Even though this was merely a product, an artifact, even if all of the powers in the Holy Land of Martialism today were to join hands, they would still not be able to match the military strength of this palace.

Even though Chu Feng felt enormous shock, he did not stop. Instead, he stepped onto the red carpet and began to rapidly proceed forward.

Before him was an entrance. An enormous signboard was attached above the entrance. Three enormous words were written on the signboard: ‘First Level Hall.’

“Rumble~~~”

As Chu Feng approached, the entrance of the First Level Hall started to slowly open, as if it were welcoming its master. However, the instant the entrance door opened, an enormous pressure surged out from within like an enormous invisible wave. Chu Feng was completely submerged by the pressure.

The pressure was so strong that Chu Feng was forced back three steps in succession before being finally able to steady himself. However, at this moment, he felt a chill down his back, and his hair began to stand on end.

At this moment, he finally felt the danger that Baili Xuankong and the others had felt before.

Chu Feng had now realized how dangerous the First Level Hall was. Merely the pressure itself might be sufficient to take his life.

However, when he saw the ten golden arrows that were floating in midair in that palace hall, Chu Feng clenched down on his teeth and decided to enter it.

“Buzz~~~”

Sure enough, right after he set foot into the palace hall, Chu Feng felt an enormous pressure coming from all directions. His body began to twist, and his bones started to emit cracking sounds.

This was not only limited to his external body. The pressure actually managed to attack his insides too. Chu Feng’s internal organs, his dantian and even his soul were all feeling that enormous pressure. It was as if his body would burst and he would die in the very next moment.

In this sort of situation, Chu Feng’s eyes shone with lightning. His Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared simultaneously. Chu Feng’s cultivation went from rank three Half Martial Emperor to rank five Half Martial Emperor in an instant.

However, even though his cultivation had increased, he was unable to reduce the pressure he felt at all.

“Sure enough, the pressure here cannot be resisted with one’s cultivation.”

Chu Feng started to frown. The situation before him was truly hard to deal with. Not only was the pressure life-threatening, the pain that he was feeling from all over his body was even more difficult to endure than having one’s heart pierced by thousands of arrows. In this sort of situation, Chu Feng did not dare to continue onward.

“Zzzzz~~~”

Right at this moment, the lightnings in Chu Feng’s blood soared out from within his blood like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses, covering Chu Feng’s entire body, fusing together with his flesh and bones.

With the emergence of his lightnings, the pressure immediately lessened greatly. Even though Chu Feng was still feeling the pressure attacking him, Chu Feng was no longer affected by it.

“Thanks.”

Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then his body shifted, and he soared into the air. He flew toward the ten arrows, grabbed all of them, then flew back.

“What excellent arrows. The things from the Ancient Era are truly extraordinary,” Chu Feng praised. Holding the ten arrows in his hand, Chu Feng was able to clearly sense that they were not Incomplete Imperial Armaments, Imperial Armaments or even Royal Armaments. Instead, they were more like talismans.

However, their might was extremely powerful. The Emperor’s might they contained was extremely pure. If pierced by those arrows, it was likely anyone beneath the Martial Emperor level would not be able to survive.

After obtaining the ten arrows, Chu Feng landed on the ground and prepared to leave.

“Rumble~~~”

However, right at this moment, he heard rumbling from behind. Turning around, he discovered that the ‘Second Level Hall’ was slowly opening.

“That is?!” As the entrance of the Second Level Hall opened, Chu Feng looked into the second palace hall. Immediately, his eyes started to shine, and he revealed an expression of shock.
