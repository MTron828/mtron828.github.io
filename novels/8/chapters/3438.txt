Chapter 3438 - Invert Right And Wrong

“Chu Feng, let’s see how long you can pretend.”

The Xu Heavenly Clansmen not only had sneers on their faces, but they were also looking at Chu Feng with very ill-intended gazes. Their gazes seemed to have been able to see through everything.

Even though they were clearly scared away by Chu Feng earlier, they actually became so arrogant again. Evidently, it was because they had witnessed Chu Feng’s refusal of Gong Mingyue’s challenge.

They felt that if Chu Feng were truly as powerful as he had stated, he couldn’t possibly refuse to accept Gong Mingyue’s challenge. Thus, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen felt that Chu Feng couldn’t possibly obtain Wuming Xingyun’s title plate, and had determined that Chu Feng was deceiving them earlier.

“I’d like to declare that what I told you all earlier was not only all true, but I was actually thinking for your sake too. If you all had refused to believe my words, the ones that would have ended up suffering would have been you all.”

“Firstly, the ones in the wrong on the Ice Summit that day were you all to begin with. The reason why I’m not looking further into this matter is because I, Chu Feng, don’t wish to bicker with you.”

“However, if you are to continue to force me, then I, Chu Feng, guarantee that your Xu Heavenly Clan will definitely end up paying considerably,” Chu Feng was extremely serious when he said those words.

He knew that those Xu Heavenly Clansmen were determined to take care of him and Chu Chengkong. Likely, he would not be able to escape the impending calamity.

However, if he was to be humiliated by those trash, he would definitely seek revenge. Furthermore... Chu Feng would make the entire Xu Heavenly Clan paid. After all, it was the Xu Heavenly Clan that was in the wrong to begin with.

Unfortunately, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen failed to understand Chu Feng’s determination for vengeance, and instead felt that Chu Feng was still trying to deceive them. Thus, they became even more furious.

“Motherfucker! You are truly a shameless bastard. As matters stand, you’re still trying to scare us? If we don’t beat you till you kneel and beg for forgiveness, your daddy I am not surnamed Xu!” A Xu Heavenly Clansmen shouted angrily. Then, boundless oppressive might swept toward Chu Feng.

Sensing that the Xu Heavenly Clansmen were planning to attack them, Chu Feng subconsciously released his own oppressive might with the intention to resist the incoming oppressive might.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng’s cultivation was currently being sealed. Naturally, he was unable to block that Xu Heavenly Clansman’s attack.

“Wuuahh.”

Two screams sounds at the same time as two figures were shot flying. They were Chu Feng and Chu Chengkong.

“That Chu Feng actually... only possesses the cultivation of a True Immortal?”

Seeing the injuries on Chu Feng and Chu Chengkong, the bystanders all felt extremely astonished. At the same time, many people revealed looks of disappointment.

When Chu Feng subconsciously released his oppressive might, everyone managed to feel his aura.

True Immortal, a rank one True Immortal on top of that. That was Chu Feng’s strength that the crowd sensed.

“Never would I have imagined that Chu Feng to be so weak. It’s no wonder that girl from the Gong Heavenly Clan doesn’t want him. It would appear that Chu Xuanyuan has no qualified successor.”

Immediately, all sorts of cutting remarks and mockery began to sound nonstop.

In fact, it was not only the bystanders that were shocked; even the Gong Heavenly Clansmen were extremely surprised.

The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was, after all, an Exalted-level expert. Thus, it took him merely an instant to capture Gong Mingyue.

After capturing Gong Mingyue, the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief returned with the Gong Heavenly Clansmen.

On the way back, they just so happened to see the Xu Heavenly Clansmen creating trouble for Chu Feng.

Seeing that the situation was bad, the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had wanted to immediately act to assist Chu Feng.

However, he was stopped by Gong Mingyue.

Gong Mingyue wanted to see how strong Chu Feng was, and the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief just so happened to also be interested in Chu Feng’s strength. Thus, they concealed themselves.

As such, the Gong Heavenly Clansmen all managed to witness what happened.

“Grandfather, did you see that? That Chu Feng is nothing more than trash. Are you really planning to marry me off to someone like that?” Gong Mingyue asked.

“Mingyue, whilst it is true that young friend Chu Feng’s cultivation is quite a bit weaker than yours, a marriage arrangement remains a marriage arrangement. Since it’s already decided, it cannot be revoked. Otherwise, what face will this old man have?” the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Grandfather, you’re trying to push me into a pit of fire. If you insist on marrying me off to someone like that, I’d rather marry that Xu Heavenly Clan’s Xu Morong,” Gong Mingyue said.

“Xu Morong? That Xu Morong is nothing more than a silk pants. How could he compare to Chu Feng?” The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“How do you know that Chu Feng is not a silk pants?” asked Gong Mingyue.

“Since he is Chu Hanxian’s grandson and Chu Xuanyuan’s son, this old man is certain that Chu Feng’s character definitely surpasses that Xu Morong’s a hundredfold. Mingyue, listen to grandfather. It is absolutely not a mistake for you to marry him,” said the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Wuuahh~~~”

Right at that moment, another scream was heard. It was Chu Feng and Chu Chengkong.

That Xu Heavenly Clansman was not only attacking Chu Feng and Chu Chengkong again, but he even stepped on top of Chu Feng, and was looking at him with ridicule-filled eyes.

“Son of Chu Xuanyuan, never would I have expected you to be such trash. Most unbelievable of all, trash like you dared to proclaim that you’re related to Lord Wuming Xingyun.”

“Everyone, perhaps you all still don’t know why our Xu Heavenly Clan ended up having conflicts with this trash.”

“It actually happened when everyone was ascending to the Ice Summit. At that time, we were all lined up in an orderly manner as we scaled the mountain. Yet, this trash here refused to abide by the rules.”

“Thus, our young master decided to step forth to reason with him, to tell him to immediately stop misbehaving. However, not only did this trash refuse to appreciate his kindness, but he even took out a title plate, saying that it was something bestowed to him by Lord Wuming Xingyun.”

“Unfortunately, right after that title plate was taken out, Lord Tantai Changfei from the Tantai Heavenly Clan appeared. He immediately saw the title plate to be a fake, and imprisoned this trash.”

“Although I do not know what sort of despicable method this trash used to escape, he remains to be trash with an exceptionally bad moral character. He is simply scum among scum,” that Xu Heavenly Clansman said to the crowd.

“Never would I have imagined Chu Feng to be such a person.”

“If all that true, that child is truly different from my imagination.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Indeed. I’ve heard about how amazing Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan were all my life. Never would I have expected their descendant to be so incompetent.”

All sorts of mocking remarks began to sound nonstop from the crowd.
