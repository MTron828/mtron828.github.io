Chapter 2707 - All Begging For Forgiveness

“Had it not been for the arrival of the Starfall Holy Land’s Elder Xingyi, I would have most likely died at your hands.”

“And now, you all actually dare to say this sort of thing to me? Do you all not find it ridiculous?”

Chu Feng began to walk toward the Chu Heavenly Clans’ men as he said those words.

Furthermore, Chu Feng’s gaze turned increasingly ice-cold as he said those words. A killing intent visible to the naked eye was surging violently in his eyes.

Seeing Chu Feng’s gaze, those members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation all started to tremble in fear.

It was only in this moment they realized that that man by the name of Chu Feng was actually an uncontrollable and fearless maverick.

Likely, he really did dare to kill them.

“Run!”

Sensing that the situation was bad, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation dragged the two injured men with them and prepared to flee.

“Boom~~~”

However, the moment they tried to flee, an enormous pressure came crushing toward them from behind. Then, it crushed them all down to the ground.

At that moment, they resembled dying dogs, unable to move in the slightest.

“You... what are you planning to do? You should know that we’re from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“If you dare to injure us, not only will you have to bear the consequences, but your entire clan will also be eliminated.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Seeing that they had no way of escape, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations began to put forth the name of their clan.

“Milord, please spare them.”

“That’s right, not only is killing one another strictly prohibited in this hunt, but they are the Chu Heavenly Clan’s young masters and young ladies.”

“As for the Chu Heavenly Clan, they are the rulers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

“You absolutely cannot kill them.”

At that moment, there were actually many people from among those who were kneeling on the ground that began to urge Chu Feng to not kill those ten members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation.

They were actually doing this because they feared that they would be implicated by Chu Feng.

After all, to them, the Chu Heavenly Clan was simply too frightening. It was something that they absolutely could not offend.

They were afraid that if those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were killed, they too would not be able to escape responsibility for their deaths.

“Shut up!” Suddenly, Chu Feng turned around and shouted loudly at those people.

The current Chu Feng was extremely ferocious. Killing intent surged in his eyes. He simply did not resemble a human at all. Instead, he resembled a demon.

Seeing such a Chu Feng and hearing that deafening shout, those people kneeling on the ground were all so frightened that their limbs grew weak.

At that moment, not a single person dared to utter another word.

“You all are cowards who could only allow yourselves to be taken advantage of and trampled upon by others! No one will blame you for that!”

“However, if you all are to try to persuade others to be cowards like you, then you will be the ones at fault!”

“If anyone dares to utter another word of nonsense, do not blame me, Chu Feng, for being impolite toward him or her!” Chu Feng berated the kneeling crowd coldly.

Chu Feng’s voice was even more ear-splitting than thunder. With every word, those people would feel their bodies tremble.

After Chu Feng said those words, not only were those people no longer daring enough to attempt to persuade him again, they did not even dare to breathe loudly.

Not only were they scared, but many among them also revealed ashamed expressions on their faces.

Chu Feng’s words were not completely unreasonable. It was true... the great majority of them were very weak.

They were so weak that they would immediately become completely obedient once they encountered someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. From the bottoms of their hearts, they never had any desire to resist.

Even though they might do very well in their ordinary lives in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and might even be somewhat superior to individuals weaker than themselves, they would become extremely servile slaves and servants the moment they encountered people from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After reprimanding those people, Chu Feng cast his gaze toward those members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation again. Furthermore, he was slowly walking toward them.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng waved his sleeve and brought forth a strong burst of wind.

All of those members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation that were forced onto the ground by him were lifted from the ground by the wind.

At that moment, their expressions all changed. They no longer possessed that utterly arrogant attitude of considering everyone to be beneath them.

At that moment, fear toward Chu Feng filled their faces.

This was especially true for the two women. They were so scared that they started crying. Their faces were already covered in tears.

“How do you all wish to die?” Chu Feng asked them.

“We don’t want to die.”

“Please don’t kill us.”

“We beg of you, please don’t kill us.”

“We will give you all of our World Spirit Bones. We beg of you, please, please don’t kill us.”

“We are able to give you whatever you want. Please, just don’t kill us.”

............

Chu Feng’s words were like a giant boulder being dropped into a tranquil lake. They immediately brought forth a massive wave.

The members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation had exploded.

Merely, what exploded was not resistance toward Chu Feng. Rather, they were begging for forgiveness.

At that moment, they were akin to ordinary people. They no longer possessed any arrogance, conceit or the attitude of being superior.

All they had was the desire to not be killed. As long as they could live, they were willing to do anything.

At that moment, the crowd that was kneeling on the ground were all struck dumb.

This was the first time that they had seen the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations begging another for forgiveness in such a low and petty manner.

Those over there were the high and above young masters and young ladies of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

If they hadn’t witnessed it themselves, they would most definitely not have believed that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were actually such cowards that feared death. It turned out that they too were capable of becoming petty and low.

Although the kneeling crowd was stunned by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations begging for forgiveness, Chu Feng had already anticipated this to happen.

Not to mention them, even that Chu Xianshuo was only someone who would bully the weak and fear the strong.

They were people who only knew how to take advantage of their position to bully others, and did not possess the moral backbone, or the integrity, that experts possessed.

“If you all wish to live, I can give you all an opportunity. However, it will depend on whether or not you all will be obedient.”

The killing intent in Chu Feng’s eyes decreased greatly when he said those words. Even his tone had eased up.

Actually, Chu Feng had never planned to kill them from the very beginning. At least, he did not plan to kill them here.

After all, if he were to kill them here, not even the Immortal Armament Villa would spare him.

In fact, Chu Feng might be immediately captured after walking out of the hunting grounds, and then handed over to the Chu Heavenly Clan to be taken care of.

Thus, from the very start, Chu Feng had merely planned to scare them.

Evidently, Chu Feng had succeeded.

“We are willing to do it. Regardless of what it is that you want from us, as long as you order it, we will definitely go and do it,” those ten Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations spoke in unison.

“I know that you all must have special methods to get in contact with the rest of your Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.”

“Go and call over all of your brothers and sisters. Do that, and I will spare your lives,” Chu Feng said.

“Yes, we’ll go and call them over right now, we’ll call them over right now.”

After hearing those words, the ten Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations did not hesitate in the slightest. One by one, they took out a special pearl and squeezed it.

Then, a layer of invisible power began to spread.

Those pearls were communication talismans. Although they possessed a very limited range, it would be sufficient for the hunting grounds.

Chu Feng knew that, not long from now, all of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations in the hunting grounds would gather.

Furthermore, Chu Feng noticed that those ten Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations all revealed a slight change in expression after squeezing apart their respective pearls.

They were not that scared anymore. In fact, they were even slightly confident. Even the expression in their eyes as they looked to Chu Feng had changed.

Their gazes seemed to be telling Chu Feng, ‘Just you wait, you’ll suffer soon.’
