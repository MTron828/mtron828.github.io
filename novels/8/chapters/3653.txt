Chapter 3653 - Chu Feng’s Battle Power

Nangong Yifan looked at Chu Feng. Unconcealed astonishment and complicated emotions filled his eyes.

Before that, he never would’ve imagined that he would be the one losing out in a match of fists against Chu Feng.

“I’ve told you. Your fist is not strong enough,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

“Bullshit!” Nangong Yifan let out a loud shout. Then, he flew explosively toward Chu Feng again.

Nangong Yifan’s attack was the same as his previous attacks. It was still a very simple and direct punch.

His intention was very clear. He was unwilling to accept what had happened, and wanted to clash fists with Chu Feng again.

As for Chu Feng, he naturally understood Nangong Yifan’s intentions. Thus, he decided to give him what he wanted.

Chu Feng took a step backward, fell into a horse stance, pulled his arm back and clenched his fist in a motion to unleash a punch.

[1. So... Paul’s Burning Fist.]

However, Chu Feng did not release his punch right away. He held back until Nangong Yifan was right in front of him before blasting out with his punch.

“Bang~~~”

The two fists collided and let out a loud explosion.

At the same time, a figure was shot flying.

It was Nangong Yifan. This time around, he was not only forced back tens of steps. Instead, he was shot flying by Chu Feng’s fist.

He flew for tens of meters before finally landing on the ground.

However, as the impact from Chu Feng’s punch was simply too strong, he still stumbled backwards over a dozen steps before finally stabilizing himself.

Chu Feng however, was completely unmoved this time around.

“Mother of god! That Chu Feng is not human!”

Even Kong Ci exclaimed in admiration.

She was someone who had fought Nangong Yifan.

The reason why they were crushingly defeated was because Nangong Yifan’s battle power was simply too strong.

It could be said that it was due to that enormous disparity in their battle power that they had suffered such a miserable defeat at Nangong Yifan’s hands.

It was as Nangong Yifan had said, even though they had the same cultivation, there was a massive disparity between their battle power.

Although Kong Ci and the others were all capable of increasing their cultivations by three levels like Nangong Yifan, their mastery of their various abilities was simply not profound enough. Thus, after their cultivation increased, their battle power was still extremely weak, and of the bottom-tier for rank five Exalted.

As for Nangong Yifan, his battle power was amongst the top.

However, judging from the situation before them, that seemed to not be the case.

If Nangong Yifan’s battle power was amongst the top, how could he be suppressed by Chu Feng?

Judging from the current situation, Nangong Yifan’s battle power would only be mid-tier at the very most. It was Chu Feng who possessed top-tier battle power.

“Fuck! My brother Chu Feng is simply too powerful!”

Kong Tianhui was extremely excited. However, when he was about to praise Chu Feng, he discovered that someone who stood beside him shouted out praise first. Furthermore, that person shouted exactly what he wanted to shout.

As for that person, it was Wuming Yuanzhi.

“Say, Wuming Yuanzhi, can you not steal my words? Chu Feng is my brother, okay? Since when did he become your brother?” asked Kong Tianhui.

“You shut up. With your bits of strength, how are you qualified to address Chu Feng as brother?”

“Only someone like me is qualified to address Chu Feng as brother,” Wuming Yuanzhi took a contemptful glance at Kong Tianhui.

“Fuck! Only now did I discover that you’re actually this shameless.” Kong Tianhui rolled his eyes in anger.

“Do you want to continue?”

“Actually, I only used thirty percent of my strength in the first punch. As for the punch earlier, I’ve only used sixty percent of my strength. If you want to come at me again, I can consider using eighty percent.”

“Of course, you should know very well that you are not qualified for me to use my full strength,” said Chu Feng.

“If martial cultivators are to fight purely with brute force, what use is there in learning martial techniques?” said Nangong Yifan.

“Fuck! That was not what that bastard said earlier. He was ridiculing you all earlier the entire time for being too weak,” Kong Tianhui said to Wuming Yuanzhi.

“What are you implying?” Wuming Yuanzhi glared at Kong Tianhui. However, he soon said, “That said, what you said is reasonable too. I never would’ve imagined that Nangong Yifan, the fellow who is as cold as an iceberg, would have such thick skin.”

“That’s right. He’s truly capable of finding excuses for himself. He is truly an unpleasant fellow,” Long Ning puffed her mouth angrily.

“Nangong Yifan, what you say is actually reasonable; it’s like a fat person calling a skinny person useless, a short person calling a tall person useless, a poor person calling a rich person useless.” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

“Well said!” Kong Tianhui was overjoyed upon hearing Chu Feng’s words.

“Never would I have imagined that Chu Feng is quite good with his words,” Even Kong Ci praised Chu Feng. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After all, Chu Feng was actually insulting Nangong Yifan for being useless.

“Talking big is not an actual show of skills. Go ahead and take out your weapon.”

“Clank~~~”

Nangong Yifan made a grabbing motion with his hand, and his halberd rose out of the ground and flew towards him, landing in his hand.

“Truth be told, I can take care of someone like you even without using any weapons. However, I will give you what you desire.”

“Of course, it’s not out of respect for you. After all, you did not show any respect to my friends earlier. As such, you are unqualified to obtain my respect.”

“I am merely choosing to take you on with a weapon because I want to test out this Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword. He even deliberately turned around to take a glance at the woman dressed in red standing amongst the All-heaven Starfield’s crowd of younger generations, Yin Zhuanghong.

Nangong Yifan was already angered by Chu Feng’s previous words. And now, after seeing Chu Feng looking at Yin Zhuanghong, his anger was completely ignited.

The reason why Nangong Yifan had targeted Chu Feng to begin with was because of Yin Zhuanghong.

“Clank~~~”

Holding the halberd in his hand, Nangong Yifan rushed forth to attack Chu Feng.

Enraged, he did not bother with superfluous words, and decided to use the most direct method from the get-go to shut Chu Feng up.

Nangong Yifan was very fast. He arrived before Chu Feng in the blink of an eye. The halberd in his hand turned fuzzy, and countless halberds appeared from all directions and pierced towards Chu Feng.

Nangong Yifan did not use any martial skill, nor did he use any secret skills or Immortal Techniques either.

He was planning to confront Chu Feng using only the power of his Incomplete Exalted Armament. He wanted to retrieve his lost honor from the earlier confrontation of fists.

As for Chu Feng, he saw through Nangong Yifan’s intention from the very start. However, he decided to give Nangong Yifan what he wanted.

Chu Feng wanted to fight Nangong Yifan in the manner that he desired so that he could make him lose completely.

Chu Feng flipped his palm, and the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword in his hand started to shine with light, its might completely unleashed.

Then, Chu Feng’s Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword collided with Nangong Yifan’s halberd.
