Chapter 5104: Chu Feng’s Talent

Two figures were currently flitting through the starry sky. One of them was Xian Miaomiao and the other was Song Changsheng.

“Master, why aren’t we using the teleportation formations instead?” Xian Miaomiao asked out of curiosity.

“It’s much faster this way,” Song Changsheng replied.

“Does this mean that you travel at a speed faster than the ancient teleportation formation? You’re incredible, master!”

Xian Miaomiao looked at Song Changsheng with eyes gleaming with admiration.

Song Changsheng didn’t answer that question. Instead, he looked at Xian Miaomiao and asked, “This is our first meeting, and you know next to nothing about me. What gave you the guts to take me as your master and leave with me?”

“Master, I’m not a fool. I can see how formidable you are. It’s my blessing to become a disciple of someone as powerful as you. Such an opportunity wouldn’t come a second time in my lifetime. I would be really foolish if I don’t clutch onto you tightly.”

Xian Miaomiao fawned on him with a sweet smile. Seeing that, Song Changsheng also smiled as well.

“Why do you wish to become strong?” Song Changsheng asked.

“Initially, I wanted to become strong just so that I would be acknowledged and respected by others. I didn’t want others to trample on me. But later on… Heh, it might sound a little childish, but I want to catch up with Chu Feng. I promised to venture into the vast world together with him, but if I don’t want the strength to stand alongside him, I’d be nothing but a burden. That’s not what I wish for,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“You wish to catch up with Chu Feng? That won’t be easy at all. Even with my help, it’s unlikely for you to be able to catch up to him within a short time. It’ll take a long time, and even so, there’s no guarantee that you’ll be able to match his footsteps.”

Song Changsheng’s words were like a pail of cold water on Xian Miaomiao, but she didn’t lose hope because of it. Instead, she said with a smile, “I know. A powerful master can only take a person so far; cultivation is ultimately determined by the individual himself. If I am unable to catch up with Chu Feng, I only have my lacking talent to blame.”

“You sure are open-minded,” Song Changsheng said with a chuckle.

He was fond of Xian Miaomiao’s carefree attitude.

“However, there’s one thing I need to tell you,” Song Changsheng suddenly said with a solemn attitude.

“What is it, master?” Xian Miaomiao asked.

“There’s so much I can help you with. Even if you encounter a fortuitous encounter and catch up with him at one point in time, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to match his pace for long. The chances are that the gap between the two of you will grow larger with time. That’s how monstrously talented Chu Feng is. To be honest, it’s weird how low his cultivation is compared to his talent,” Song Changsheng said.

“Chu Feng’s cultivation is considered low? Didn’t you say that Chu Feng has already reached rank eight Martial Exalted level and rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation?” Xian Miaomiao exclaimed in astonishment.

She thought that Chu Feng’s accomplishment was already terrifying.

“It’s low. Given his talent, he should have achieved much more at his age. At the very least, his name should have been known throughout the vast world of cultivation, towering above all other prodigies,” Song Changsheng said.

“Is Chu Feng that formidable?”

Xian Miaomiao was surprised. She knew that Chu Feng was highly talented, but she didn’t think that he would be that formidable.

Towering above all other prodigies in the vast world of cultivation? Wouldn’t that make Chu Feng the most talented junior in the world of cultivation?

“Master, I think I know why Chu Feng’s cultivation is low,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“You know?”

Song Changsheng was surprised to hear that.

“Chu Feng started off in a Lower Realm, and he only had himself to rely on all this time…”

Xian Miaomiao talked all about the difficulties Chu Feng faced along the way that she knew of.

“Is that the case?” Song Changsheng remarked in surprise. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He knew that Chu Feng was extremely talented, but he had no idea what Chu Feng had been through thus far.

“Master, why don’t you take Chu Feng in as your disciple?” Xian Miaomiao suddenly asked.

“Chu Feng’s master isn’t any weaker than me, and there isn’t just his master,” Song Changsheng said with a sigh.

“Ah? Master, is Chu Feng’s master that formidable? Who else is there other than his master?” Xian Miaomiao asked out of curiosity.

“You don’t need to bother with that. All you need to know is that even though Chu Feng had to grind his way up to where he is, the process has brought him great benefits in the form of his sturdy foundation. He might have a slow start, but his sturdy foundation means that his cultivation will grow faster and faster. Given sufficient time, he’ll likely achieve great things in the future. There’s bound to be a huge gap between the two of you,” Song Changsheng said.

He was worried that Xian Miaomiao would suffer a blow upon hearing the truth, but Xian Miaomiao didn’t look disappointed in the least. Instead, her face lit up in excitement.

“I knew that Chu Feng was formidable, but I didn’t think that it would be to this extent,” Xian Miaomiao said with a joyful smile.

She was feeling happy for Chu Feng.

“Aren’t you planning on catching up with him? You’re surprisingly happy despite knowing that you might never be able to match his footsteps,” Song Changsheng asked in confusion.

He was effectively telling Xina Miaomiao that her goal would never be realized, and that was a cruel truth.

“He’s an important friend to me. It goes without saying that I’m happy for him,” Xian Miaomiao replied with a sweet smile.

Song Changsheng was stunned. It was one thing if Xian Miaomiao was putting on an act, but he could feel her sincerity behind those words. He finally understood why Chu Feng would go to all lengths to save Xian Miaomiao despite being fully cognizant of his own weakness.

Such a friendship was touching even to him. It allowed him to make up his mind.

“While it’s inevitable that there’ll be a gap between the two of you, the rate of which will slow if you dare to take in this item,” Song Changsheng said as he took out a wooden box from his Cosmos Sack.

Xian Miaomiao’s eyes lit up upon seeing the wooden box. There were formations embedded into the wooden box, and she could tell just how formidable they were with a glance. It made her extremely curious about what was inside the wooden box.

Under her expectant eyes, Song Changsheng opened the wooden box.

Weng!

Green light gushed into the sky, and everything in the vicinity began shaking intensely. It was as if a king had descended upon the world, and all beings were lowering their heads to him.
