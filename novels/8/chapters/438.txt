MGA: Chapter 439 - Jiang Yini

When facing that situation, Chu Feng could only calmly smile. There were too many unfair things in the world. How many people understood the truth of matters? And the so-called characters of justice. They were the lies of certain people, yet how many people’s eyes were blinded by them?

Thus, he no longer cared about the world’s opinion because the people of the world were stupid. They were unable to determine the truths and the lies.

Thus, he only cared about the people he cared about. He, Chu Feng, did not live for the living of the world. He lived for himself and the ones close to him.

Thus, even if everyone in the world died, what did that have to do with him? He only did things he felt that were right. He only did things he liked to do.

If the people of the world felt that Chu Feng’s actions were not right and viewed Chu Feng as the bad person yet Chu Feng was happy, he would just admit he was a bad person.

*Hualalala~~~~*

Suddenly, in the tranquil sky surrounding Chu Feng, lines of blue light suddenly appeared. Countless thick Spirit Formation chains emerged into the air and surrounded from all directions. With a mere blink, they locked Chu Feng and Zi Ling inside.

It was a huge formation. A very powerful Spirit Formation, one that required the combined power of many Blue-cloak World Spiritists in order to be completed.

After that Spirit Formation was laid, dozens of figures also appeared. They appeared within Chu Feng’s and Zi Ling’s line of sight.

Those people were all in the Heaven realm. There were even a few in the 4th level of the Heaven realm, and they were all wearing the clothing of the Jiang Dynasty.

“Crap.” At that instant, Chu Feng hiddenly cursed because what they did happened too fast. Almost at the same time he reacted to everything that happened, his escape was already sealed.

Clearly, they had prepared early and their methods were extremely high-class. He did not even detect any trace of abnormality, let alone being able to defend.

“Chu Feng, Zi Ling. Do you two know why we need to apprehend you?” Just at that time, an old man stood out. His hair was white as snow, his eyes were like an eagle’s, and his aura was the same as the heads of the several big powers, being at the 5th level of the Heaven realm.

One at the 5th level of the Heaven realm, several at the 4th level of the Heaven realm, and dozens of Heaven realm experts. The formation was truly too strong. Facing something like that, with Chu Feng’s current cultivation, he clearly felt a bit powerless.

“Leave, or else you will all die here.” However, in a situation like that, Zi Ling was not afraid in the slightest. Her purple-coloured pupils appeared and layers of purple-coloured gas surrounded her body. She released her Divine Body’s power.

At that moment, when the power of the Divine Body appeared, Zi Ling’s entire demeanor became completely different.

Although her cultivation was only in the 9th level of the Profound realm, when she stood there, she emanated an atmosphere that no one else had, as if she was the king of that area. In terms of outward bearing, she was superior to all of the Heaven realm dynasty experts.

“Quite strong methods. This power that is completely different from others... It seems like you have cultivated a Forbidden Mysterious Technique, and you even cultivated it very well.”

“Ahh, with such good talent, even if you had normally cultivated, you would have had a great future. But you had to walk on the askew path. Truly a shame.”

That white-haired old man smiled as he stared at Zi Ling. Although he felt a bit amazed from Zi Ling change, he did not panic. Rather, there was always the domineering light smile on the corners of his mouth, as if he was always planning and in control of the situation. At the same time, he also shook his head in pity.

“If you don’t move, you are looking to die.” However, the current Zi Ling also didn’t waste any words. With a thought, the purple-coloured gas was like a cruel and fierce beast. With bursts of cries, it flew towards the surrounding Spirit Formation chains and wanted to break open the formation.

“Merely the 9th level of the Profound realm. You truly overestimate yourself!”

However, facing Zi Ling’s attacks, the people from the Jiang Dynasty were not afraid in the slightest. They moved at the same time, and with special formations, the boundless Heaven power became an air-tight wall and surrounded Zi Ling and Chu Feng.

“Stop!” However, in the instant both sides were preparing to use powerful attacks to exchange blows, a female’s fierce yell suddenly rang out from the sky.

And after hearing that voice, the experts of the Jiang Dynasty hurriedly stopped their attacks and dissolved the Spirit Formation that was in mid-air.

Seeing that, Zi Ling’s brows slightly raised and her beautiful purple-coloured pupils returned to their original state. At the same time, the purple-coloured gas that surrounded her body also returned.

At that instant, Chu Feng shifted in the air and stopped in front of Zi Ling. He put the beauty with a violent temper behind him.

He did that because he knew that even if the white-haired old man wasn’t much, the female who fiercely shouted just now was the character most difficult to take care of.

Indeed, shortly after that fierce yell rang out, a gap opened in the sealed Spirit Formation chains. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

And from the gap, a golden-clothed female who was tall, had a protruding front and back, and also had a bit of purple, walked in.

The age of that female seemed to be just past twenty, and even though her appearance couldn’t be said to be extremely beautiful, she was absolutely not bad.

However, in front of Zi Ling, the exceptional little beauty, she did seem a bit ordinary.

But her figure was very good. Also, her body gave off airs that was different from the crowd. Her unique charm caused people to be very comfortable when they looked at her.

“Princess!”

At that instant, within the formation, a thunder-like voice rang out from the dynasty experts.

When the Heaven realm experts faced the appearance of the young female, all of them couldn’t avoid kneeling to greet her. Petty expressions emerged onto their faces, and even the white-haired old man with cultivation in the 5th level of the Heaven realm was no exception.

At that moment, the female’s identity was also confirmed. Clearly, she was the number one genius of the Jiang Dynasty, Jiang Yini.

The cultivation of the 6th level of the Heaven realm, comparable to the Fire God School’s supreme elder. However, the Fire God School’s supreme elder had been cultivating for dozens of years. His age was near one hundred while being in the 6th level of the Heaven realm.

But that woman. She was only in her twenties yet she already had her present achievements. It could be seen that her talent was truly outstanding. In front of her, Jie Qingming or Xu Zhongyu would not dare to call themselves a genius.

“Elders, step down. I have some things I want to chat with Brother Chu Feng on my own.” Jiang Yini waved her hand.

“As you wish!”

In response, not a single expert of the Jiang Dynasty went against her word. They hurriedly removed the Spirit Formation chains and they orderly stood at the horizon afar.

At that instant, Chu Feng slightly furrowed his brows. Although the overwhelmingly strong Spirit Formation chains were no longer there and the dozens of Heaven realm experts all backed away, leaving a single young female in front of them, Chu Feng knew that the woman called Jiang Yini was likely even more dangerous and terrifying than the chain formation and the dozens of dynastical Heaven realm experts.

“Chu Feng, do you know how long I have been searching you for?” Jiang Yini indifferently asked.

“Everything was done by myself. If you want to kill or cut, do it on me. It is unrelated to Zi Ling.” Chu Feng spoke.

“Chu Feng, you..” After hearing those words, Zi Ling’s little face instantly changed and she could not suppress her anxiousness. She wanted to stand out to say something, but her hands were tightly grabbed by Chu Feng and she was pulled back by him again.

At that instant, for some reason, Zi Ling instinctively took back the words she wanted to say. As if no matter how much more powerful she was, when she was beside Chu Feng, she was only willing to be a little girl.
