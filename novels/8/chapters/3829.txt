Chapter 3829 - Determined To Protect

“You want to teach me a lesson? That would depend on whether or not you’re capable.” Chu Feng showed no sign of fear toward Li Xiao’s senior.

“Humph. I know that you’re an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.”

“But, did you really think you could bully the young and weak just because of that?”

“Don’t you think that just because you’re an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, you can act rashly and bully the people of the younger generation.”

The experts that the other people of the younger generation were relying on all stood forth in succession and began to criticize Chu Feng.

“Enough with the superfluous words. If you want to attack me, go ahead and do it; why bother denouncing my name?” said Chu Feng.

“You...”

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, those experts all turned green with anger.

That said, even though they had shouted at and denounced Chu Feng, no one had actually attacked him.

No matter what, Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

Unlike martial cultivators, Saint-cloak World Spiritists were extremely rare across the entire All-heaven Starfield.

What was the most powerful aspect about world spiritists? That would be their connections.

Thus, even though they angrily denounced Chu Feng, they would still be somewhat afraid if they were to truly asked to attack him.

Not to mention the others, even Li Xiao’s peak Exalted-level senior acted in such a manner.

When he had released his oppressive might earlier, it was merely a bluff.

“What arrogance! You are clearly the one in the wrong, yet you’re acting so righteous and confident.”

“People like you are the reason why the reputation of us world spiritists is defamed.”

Right at that moment, another voice was heard. Accompanying that voice was an old man.

That old man wore a daoist robe and emitted an immortal air. He resembled an old immortal that had descended upon the mortal world.

One could tell from a glance that he was extraordinary.

His daoist robe was no ordinary daoist robe. Instead, it was a world spiritist cloak.

Spirit power flowed through his world spiritist cloak like roaming dragons.

Upon close inspection, one would be able to tell that it was actually Snake Mark Saint-cloak spirit power.

That person was a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

When that old man appeared, the crowd all felt deep veneration for him. Regardless of whether they were bystanders there to spectate or people that came to take care of Chu Feng, they all revealed very respectful looks on their faces after seeing that old man. They even clasped their fists and bowed respectfully.

A man followed behind that old daoist.

That man looked at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with anger. Furthermore, there was a look of pride on his face.

That man was Meng Rufei.

Actually, before he’d even seen Meng Rufei, Chu Feng had already managed to guess who the old man was.

He was most definitely Meng Rufei’s renowned master.

That man was called Zhang Duotuo, and known as Grandmaster Duotuo.

Zhang Duotuo appeared with great arrogance. Not only did he unleash his strength as a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, but he had also unleashed his oppressive might.

However, compared to his world spirit techniques, his cultivation was slightly weaker.

He was a peak Exalted.

Although peak Exalted was a very strong level of cultivation, the current Chu Feng was not afraid of peak Exalted-level experts.

However, it remained that Zhang Duotuo was a renowned individual of the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

Thus, when he appeared, the experts that wanted to teach Chu Feng a lesson immediately found their pillar of support. One by one, they looked at him with shaper gazes.

“Everyone, someone like that should be taught a lesson.”

“You all need not be lenient towards him. Today, I, Zhang Duotuo, shall uphold justice for everyone," said Zhang Duotuo.

Zhang Duotuo did not plan to personally teach Chu Feng a lesson.

Perhaps it was because he felt that someone like Chu Feng was not qualified for him to personally act.

However, his words immediately became the pillar of support for Li Xiao and the other younger generations’ seniors.

One by one, they all unleashed their oppressive might again. This time around, they were no longer putting on a show. They were truly planning to teach Chu Feng a lesson.

Seeing that they were planning to attack him, Chu Feng showed no sign of fear. He was prepared to take them on.

Suddenly, a voice exploded from behind Chu Feng. “Everyone, I’d urge you all to reconsider!”

That voice shook everyone present. However, when they saw the person who had arrived behind Chu Feng, they revealed looks of contempt, and even disgust.

The reason for that was because the person who had arrived was no one special. It was only Fan Chou.

“Everyone, you all say that Asura is bullying the weak and young?”

“But, he is also a person of the younger generation. Since he’s a person of the younger generation, how is he bullying the young?”

“If anything, it’s the people of the younger generation under your sects that are inferior to him," Fan Chou said loudly.

He was completely calm and unflustered.

He showed none of the signs of timidness from before. Instead, he had a look of seeing Mount Tai before him, yet showing no fear, and gave off the air of a general.

“Humph, a person of the younger generation? What an utterly ridiculous joke. How could a person of the younger generation possess the cultivation of rank two Exalted?”

Fan Chou’s words were immediately met with ridicule.

“Who said that a person of the younger generation cannot possess a cultivation of rank two Exalted? Isn’t the All-heaven Sect’s Nangong Yifan a rank two Exalted?” refuted Fan Chou.

“What a joke! Who is Nangong Yifan? He’s the strongest genius of our All-heaven Starfield. How could someone like him possibly be compared to young master Nangong Yifan?”

The crowd continued to ridicule Fan Chou’s words. They felt that his words were akin to a joke.

“As the saying goes, beyond the sky is the greater heavens, beyond the individual are stronger people. Just because you haven’t seen it doesn’t mean that it does not exist.”

“Whilst Nangong Yifan is indeed the number one genius of the All-heaven Starfield, he is likely unable to even be ranked among the geniuses in the entire Holy Light Starfield, much less the entire boundless martial cultivation world,” said Fan Chou.

“Are you implying that this person is a person beyond the individual, a top genius from another starfield?”

“What shamelessness. For the sake of arguing for him, you actually brought up the entire vast and boundless martial cultivation world?”

“You should wash your eyes and have a proper look. Does he resemble that sort of exceptional genius?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“He’s clearly nothing more than a shameless fellow who only knows how to bully the young.”

The crowd were no longer only ridiculing Fan Chou. Their words had turned increasingly sharp, and their gazes increasingly hostile.

They seemed like they also planned to teach Fan Chou a lesson should he dare say anything more.

Right at that moment, Li Xiao said to his senior before him, “Senior, that Fan Chou and that Asura are together. Do not bother arguing with him. They are jackals of the same tribe to begin with.”

“So that’s the case. Turns out you’re actually jackals of the same tribe. It’s no wonder you would argue for such a shameless fellow.”

“That said, this old man is not someone who will bully the weak. Scram immediately, and I will forget about this matter. However, if you refuse to listen, do not blame this old man for becoming impolite.” Li Xiao’s senior pointed at Fan Chou after hearing Li Xiao’s words.

The other experts present also started threatening Fan Chou.

Actually, if it wasn’t for the fact that more and more people were gathering around them, they would not have acted like people of higher demeanor, and would have attacked Fan Chou already.

However, as there were bystanders present, they had to maintain their higher demeanor. Thus, they did not directly attack Fan Chou.

Facing their threats, Fan Chou showed no trace of fear. Instead, he narrowed his brows and revealed a look of anger. “Today, I am determined to protect Asura. If you all insist on attacking him, do not blame me for not giving you all face.”

“Oh-ho. You, a person of the younger generation, dares to speak such arrogant claptrap?”

“Since you’re unable to differentiate good from bad, I will properly teach you a lesson today.”

The experts all grew even more furious upon hearing Fan Chou’s words. They then all unleashed their oppressive might and intended to attack both Chu Feng and Fan Chou.

“Boom~~~”

However, right after their oppressive mights were released, an even stronger oppressive might swept forth.

That oppressive might wreaked havoc in its path, bringing forth wind and moving the clouds. It seemed like it would devour the entire sky as it scattered in all directions.

Not only did that oppressive might instantly disperse the others’ oppressive might, but it also sent them rolling on the ground. Not even Meng Rufei’s master Zhang Duotuo was an exception.

Upon closer inspection, the crowd’s expressions all changed. Even Chu Feng revealed a look of surprise.

That overwhelmingly powerful oppressive might was at the Utmost Exalted realm.

However, that oppressive might... had actually been released by Fan Chou.
