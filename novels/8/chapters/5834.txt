Chapter 5835: Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion, Zhao Gongyi

Chapter 5835: Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion, Zhao Gongyi

The managing elder of the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild, Gao Hao, had prepared a place for Chu Feng to decipher the Junior Blessing Formations.

It was a formation realm that wasn’t particularly big, but it contained a powerful formation that hastened Chu Feng’s rate of unraveling the Junior Blessing Formation.

The Junior Blessing Formation was more difficult to decipher than Chu Feng had expected. Despite the aid of the powerful formation, it took him three days to unravel the first formation. Inside the formation was a red crystal, a cultivation resource for world spirits.

The Junior Blessing Formation was similar to the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment, as there was no telling what was inside. The only difference was that the former was bound to have something beneficial to world spiritists or world spirits, whereas the latter was either make it or break it.

The red crystal’s quality greatly bolstered Chu Feng’s confidence in the Junior Blessing Formation, and he didn’t think that it would be the best thing inside either. He was hoping to find treasures beneficial to Eggy’s recovery.

...

The happenings at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith spread like wildfire.

The world of cultivation was surprised to learn that Chu Feng was alive, and they were taken aback by the reappearance of the Ancient Era’s Heavenly Clans too.

However, what shocked them was how Chu Feng had defeated the juniors of an Ancient Era’s Heavenly Clan and emerged as the number one prodigy at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. On top of that, he even absorbed the legendary energy, Genesis Bloodline.

His accomplishments were so astounding that there was no room for doubt at all. He had truly proven himself this time around. The world was saying that Jie Ranqing’s son had finally shown his edge, and he was shining brighter than Jie Ranqing herself. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

...

There was a massive realm located deep underground in one of the Immortal Sea Galaxy’s Upper Realms.

This realm boasted a size that wasn’t much smaller than most Upper Realms. It was so thoroughly concealed that the present-era cultivators and world spiritists couldn’t find it without relying on special means.

Those who resided here wore a world spiritist cloak. On top of that, flags bearing the words ‘Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’ could be seen flying all over the realm.

One of the teleportation formations here activated, and teleportation energy surged. Soon, a group of people appeared.

At the forefront of the group was the young man Chu Feng met at the auction hall. He had a livid expression on his face.

The group took off their world spiritist cloaks, revealing most people to be advanced in age.

“Young master Gongyi, you’re back. How was your trip?”

A few elders stepped forward to welcome them back with smiles. The white-haired elder who stood at the forefront of this group was likely to be of lofty standing.

“It was terrible. We spent the money equivalent to a top-quality God Armament on a normal bamboo slip. Which bastard invented the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragment? That scoundrel is just making a fool of us! I shan’t participate in such matters in the future. Whoever’s interested can go instead,” the young man named Gong Yi said as he angrily tossed a bamboo slip on the floor.

His name was Zhao Gongyi, and he was the young master of the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion. His grandfather was the incumbent Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master.

There was no way Zhao Gongyi would admit to being screwed over by Chu Feng, so he blamed it on the creator of the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip’s fragments.

“This...”

The face of the white-haired elder stiffened up, and the elders standing behind Zhao Gongyi shot him a look. This made the white-haired elder realize that something must have happened that caused the young master to blow his top.

Thus, the white-haired elder quickly changed the topic. “Young master Gongyi, we have received news from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.”

“Nine Heavens’ Zenith, the tournament among the present-era juniors? You don’t have to report that to me. I’m not interested,” Zhao Gongyi scoffed as he marched away.

“The juniors from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan went too, including Huangfu Shengyu,” the white-haired elder said.

“Oh?” Zhao Gongyi halted his footstep. He turned around and asked, “What’s going through Huangfu Shengyu’s head? Someone of his standing competed with the present-era trash?”

“They went, but they were defeated by the man named Chu Feng. On top of that, it’s unknown whether they are alive or dead,” the white-haired elder said.

“Huangfu Shengyu was defeated? That’s impossible! How could Huangfu Shengyu lose to those trash?” Zhao Gongyi found this matter hard to believe.

“Young master Gongyi, we have verified this matter. The Huangfu Heavenly Clan even confronted the present-era cultivators about their missing juniors, only to be killed by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master,” the white-haired elder said.

Zhao Gongyi and the elders who had traveled with him were taken aback.

“The Huangfu Heavenly Clan was defeated in a confrontation against the present-era cultivators? Did they dispatch the weaklings there?” an elder asked.

“Huangfu Bufan personally led the team,” the white-haired elder replied.

“Huangfu Bufan? And he was still defeated?”

“Not only was he defeated, but he was also killed on the spot.”

The faces of the crowd turned grim. They knew Huangfu Bufan—he was a Heavenly God level cultivator, an extremely powerful existence.

“Who could have defeated Huangfu Bufan? Does the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion have a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist?” one of the elders asked.

“Their incumbent Mansion Master is indeed a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist, and we aren’t sure what his exact cultivation rank is. However, Huangfu Bufan was powerless before him,” the white-haired elder said.

“There’s someone like that among the present-era world spiritists?”

The crowd turned grim. They hadn’t thought there would be any Heavenly God level cultivators and Heavenly Dragon World Spiritists in the present era. This could throw a wrench in their plans.
