Chapter 4637: The True Number One

Shortly after the spirit formation gate opened, a figure stepped out.

Xia Yan.

Shortly after Xia Yan walked out, a spirit formation gate also formed beside her, but this time around, it was Xiao Yu walking out from within.

The spirit formation gates soon closed behind them after they walked out.

The first thing that the two of them did after coming out was to scan their surroundings and verify the current situation. However, when they noticed that Chu Feng was nowhere to be seen, a contemplative look appeared on their faces.

“With this, it would mean that only that offspring from the Holy Light Galaxy isn’t out yet.”

“We shouldn’t bother waiting for him. He’s a mere rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist. It would be a stretch to call him a prodigy! He only managed to get here by luck, so I reckon that he might have already lost his life in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace by now!”

Xia Yan and Xiao Yu had already noticed the seven prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, which affirmed their thoughts that they had been eliminated. However, they didn’t think that the one who would get humiliated after their elimination was Chu Feng.

Chu Feng wasn’t even around at the moment!

At this very moment, the two of them felt a little conflicted inside.

On one hand, they were glad that Chu Feng had been eliminated and didn’t have to cross blows with the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, but on another hand, they wished not to see Chu Feng being put through such humiliation. After all, it was thanks to his help that the two of them were able to survive the various crises that they encountered.

The others might not know what Chu Feng was capable of, but they did.

“Brother Xiao Yu, this is weird. Brother Chu Feng should have been out by now. Do you think he’s hiding inside there?” Xia Yan pointed to the light sphere above the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace as she asked.

“I’m unable to see through it.”

Xiao Yu also carried the same doubts too. She used her means to look at the light sphere, but she was unable to make out anything at all.

“Chu Feng, stop hiding. I know that you’re in there. Quickly come out and shut these people’s mouths. Let them know that you are actually the most talented junior here.”

All of a sudden, Xia Yan cupped her hands around her mouth as she shouted loudly toward the light sphere.

Naturally, her actions immediately caught everyone’s notice.

“Is there a problem with you? How could the trash from Holy Light Galaxy possibly be in there? Do you what’s that? It’s a phenomenon, a phenomenon triggered by our clan’s Gongsun Yuntian!”

The crowd from the Gongsun Yuntian began criticizing Xia Yan coldly.

They felt that Xia Yan’s claim that Chu Feng was inside the light sphere was an insult to their Gongsun Clan. They couldn’t allow such falsehoods to go around, or else it might sully the name of the Gongsun Clan.

“Phenomenon? By Gongsun Yuntian? Hah, does he have the ability to do so? Let me tell you! Even if this is really a phenomenon, it could only possibly be triggered by Chu Feng!” Xia Yan said.

“Hahahahahaha...”

However, those words were only met with laughter from the crowd.

“Say, just what in the world did you experience in there for you to suffer such severe mental damage? Do your words not go through your brain first?”

“Don’t you know that the junior known as Chu Feng came from the Holy Light Galaxy? How could trash like him possibly have the ability to trigger a phenomenon?”

The crowd mocked Xia Yan mercilessly.

In their view, just the fact that Chu Feng came from the Holy Light Galaxy was already evidence of his weakness.

This was simply the prejudice that the Nine Souls Galaxy carried toward the Holy Light Galaxy. Even if they didn’t know Chu Feng personally, just the fact that he had come from that ‘inferior place’ was more than enough for them to discredit his strength.

“Everyone, let me emphasize once more that I’m not from the Holy Light Galaxy but the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.”

But it was then that a voice suddenly sounded.

The voice brought shocked looks to the faces all around. The crowd could tell that the voice belonged to Chu Feng, and it was coming from no other than the golden sphere.

“Could it really be...?”

Everyone’s eyes immediately turned to the golden sphere as an ominous premonition grew in their hearts.

This was especially so for Gongsun Yuntian and those from the Gongsun Clan. Their faces warped in shock, and goosebumps rose all over their bodies. Their nervousness reached a level where it couldn’t even be expressed in words.

If this matter was really true, instead of bringing glory to the Gongsun Clan, their reputation would fall to tatters. It would prove that their greatest prodigy was actually inferior to someone from the Holy Light Galaxy.

Boom!

With a loud explosion, the golden sphere shattered apart. A divine golden aura began swirling in midair, as if heralding the arrival of an extremely powerful individual.

Soon, amidst the swirling golden aura, a silhouette gradually came into appearance. His figure gradually gained clarity before the eyes of the crowd, allowing one to make out his face and body.

“Heh, I knew it!”

Xia Yan swung her fist into the air excitedly.

Even the cold Xiao Yu revealed a rare smile at this situation.

As for the rest of the crowd, they were utterly dumbfounded. For a long while, they found themselves unable to speak a word at all.

That was because the person who had just appeared was no other than the ‘trash from the Holy Light Galaxy’ whom they had just mocked, Chu Feng.

“My apologies. It was simply too comfortable in there that I accidentally fell asleep. Brother Xia Yan, thank you for waking me up. Otherwise, I don’t know how long I would have ended up sleeping for.”

After saying those words to Xia Yan, he turned his gaze toward Gongsun Yuntian and the other members of the Gognsun Clan standing on the spectator stand.

“Hm? What’s wrong? Why do all of you have such awful looks on your faces?”

Even though Chu Feng was asking with feigned innocence, the gleeful smile on his face made it more than apparent that he was mocking them.

“Chu Feng, you’re too arrogant! Lord Black Demon, Chu Feng must have resorted to some despicable means to exploit the phenomenon. There’s just no way he could have been the first one to escape from the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace! How could he have even possibly triggered the phenomenon? Just the thought of it is ludicrous! Lord Black Demon, you must uphold justice for us here!”

The crowd from the Gongsun Clan turned their gazes toward the Wretched Black Demon, hoping for him to speak up on their behalf.

They were still having difficulties trying to come to terms with what they had just seen, so they were hoping to reverse the situation through the Wretched Black Demon’s words. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“This...”

However, their words only put the Wretched Black Demon in a spot.

One must know that even the Wretched Black Demon himself hadn’t fully grasped the powers of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. He really had no idea how the phenomenon came to be, so the best he could do was to make some conjectures.

Weng!

It was then that Chu Feng suddenly raised his hand, revealing a faint formation sitting on his palm. The golden aura from the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace began to appear once more, and it surged straight toward the formation sitting on his palm.

Soon, a golden sphere identical to the one before was formed.

Boom!

However, shortly after it was formed, it suddenly exploded once more, dissipating into the surroundings. Of course, this was done under Chu Feng’s will.

He was proving to everyone else that the phenomenon was caused by him, and he wielded the power to control it.

“This isn’t a phenomenon but the formation I used to leave the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. It’s due to the peculiarity of the formation that resulted in the creaion of the golden sphere. I didn’t think that a formation I comprehended in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace would actually be deemed to be ‘despicable means’ by the Gongsun Clan. Are you looking down on me over here, or are you looking down on Lord Black Demon’s treasure?”

Chu Feng asked the clan member of the Gongsun Clan who spoke up earlier.

That clan member’s face turned awful as he realized that he had misspoken. He lowered his head, not daring to face Chu Feng at all. He knew that he had embarrassed not just himself but the entire Gongsun Clan here.

The atmosphere swiftly turned incredibly awkward.

No one thought that the one who performed the best in the trial would actually be no other than the man they despised, the person who had come from the lowly Holy Light Galaxy.

The ones who were feeling embarrassed at this turn of events wasn’t just the Gongsun Clan but the renowned world spiritists coming from all over the Nine Souls Galaxy.

Pah!

Pah pah!

“Amazing. You have indeed exceeded my expectations!”

...

All of a sudden, a series of claps sounded, breaking the awkward atmosphere. It came from the Wretched Black Demon.

“It’s no wonder why they say that you mustn’t judge a book by its cover. Young friend Chu Feng, today, you have opened not just my eyes but the eyes of the entire Nine Souls Galaxy!”

The Wretched Black Demon stood up and began making his way toward Chu Feng.

“This is a gift that I have been wanting to give to a junior, but I haven’t been able to find anyone suitable all this while. However, I believe that young friend Chu Feng will be worthy of it.”

The Wretched Black Demon took out a box and handed it over to Chu Feng.

This series of actions brought displeased looks on the faces of Gongsun Yuntian and the other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.

One must know that they had to walk up to the Wretched Black Demon to collect the prizes, but the Wretched Black Demon actually walked all the way up to Chu Feng personally to deliver the prize to him.

It was only a subtle difference, but its significance was not lost on anyone here.

Chu Feng accepted the box and opened it on the spot, only for the item inside to float out under the effects of a formation constructed on the box. As such, everyone was able to see what the item was.

It was a unique world spiritist robe weaved using crystal feathers. The crystal feathers gleamed brilliantly under the rays of the sun, taking the crowd’s breath away with its beauty.

“That’s... the Crystalfeather Immortal Cloak!”

Looks of envy appeared on the faces of the crowd upon seeing the world spiritist robe.

Legends had it that back in the Ancient Era, there was an extremely beautiful monstrous beast known as the Crystalfeather Immortal Crane. The Crystalfeather Immortal Cloak was weaved together using the precious feathers of the Crystalfeather Immortal Crane.

This treasure wasn’t created by the Wretched Black Demon. Instead, he found it in a remnant.

The Crystalfeather Immortal Cloak offered hardly any aid to the world spiritist wearing it, but it was still considered a precious treasure due to its beautiful aesthetic and the precious materials used to make it.

It was said that a renowned world spiritist from another galaxy had once offered a high price to purchase this item from the Wretched Black Demon, only to be firmly rejected. Yet, the Wretched Black Demon actually gave it to Chu Feng today.

It was indeed a huge surprise for those who knew about the Crystalfeather Immortal Cloak.

If the Wretched Black Demon’s act of gifting world spiritist cloaks to Chu Feng, Gongsun Yuntian, and the other prodigies of the Gongsun Clan represented his acknowledgment of their abilities, the difference in the value of gifts showed that he regarded Chu Feng much higher than Gongsun Yuntian and the others!
