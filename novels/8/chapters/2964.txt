Chapter 2964 - You’ve Been Warned

“I merely have a suggestion. The Sacred Domain Selection has started. Let us not waste everyone’s time.”

“If you feel that Chu Feng’s ascension to the tenth step is but a false reputation and not actual ability, you can use this Sacred Domain Selection to compete against him.”

“The two of you can enter the Death Gate, whoever exits first shall be the winner. What say you?” Chu Ruoshi said.

“Humph, I will naturally have no problem with it,” Chu Haoyan said disapprovingly.

“Little brother Chu Feng, what say you?” Chu Ruoshi looked to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng did not answer. Even though Chu Haoyan was still grabbing his lapel, even though he was still provoking and insulting him, even though Chu Feng could feel the questioning gazes of the crowd, Chu Feng still did not answer. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was not that Chu Feng was afraid. How could he possibly be afraid?

While he was not afraid of Chu Haoyan, he was fearful for Chu Yue. He was afraid that Chu Yue would be harmed once he left the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“This would only be a sparring match between you and Chu Haoyan. Regardless of the outcome of the match, it will have nothing to do with anyone.”

“If someone is to target others because of this match, or tries to retaliate in the future, I, Chu Ruoshi, will stand forth to uphold justice,” Chu Ruoshi said.

Chu Ruoshi was very intelligent. At least, she was much smarter than many of the people present. She did not feel that Chu Feng had kept silent for so long because he was afraid of Chu Haoyan. On the contrary, she was able to tell that Chu Feng was worried for Chu Yue.

That was why she said those words.

After Chu Ruoshi said those words, Chu Yue’s hands eased their grip. It would appear that she felt much more at ease with Chu Ruoshi as her backer.

Thus, at that moment, Chu Feng finally opened his mouth and said, “That’s fine.”

“Humph, fine? You’re fine now? Why were you refusing to spar earlier then?”

“The Heavenly Lightning Steps’ tenth step. Hahaha. That’s nothing much either.”

As Chu Haoyan said those words, he forcibly swung Chu Feng and tossed him several meters away. He used so much strength that he nearly smashed Chu Feng to the ground.

At that moment, Chu Feng was broken away from Chu Yue. Like a ferocious beast, the killing intent in his eyes immediately burst forth.

“What’s this? You’re feeling unreconciled?” Chu Haoyan asked.

“Enough. Don’t waste anymore time. Go in,” right at that moment, Chu Ruoshi spoke again.

“This lady has no time to bother looking at you all fighting here. I don’t care if you want to enter or not, but I’m going to enter,” Chu Lingxi suddenly said.

After she finished saying those words, she immediately flew into the open gate, In the blink of an eye, she had disappeared.

Chu Lingxi’s movement was like a command for the start of the Sacred Domain Selection. Many of the people present immediately set off after her. They too flew into the open gate.

“Humph, trash. Today, I will give Chu Ruoshi face and let you know what a true genius is.”

“If you feel unreconciled, I, Chu Haoyan, will properly take care of you after this Sacred Domain Selection is finished,” Chu Haoyan said while pointing at Chu Feng.

After he finished saying those words, he too started flying toward the open gate.

As for Chu Feng, he did not set off immediately. Instead, he arrived beside Chu Yue and asked concernedly, “Big sis Chu Yue, are you alright?”

“Little brother Chu Feng, I am truly sorry. It’s all because of me that you’ve ended up suffering,” Chu Yue said with an apologetic expression on her face.

Chu Feng was slightly surprised upon hearing those words. It appeared that Chu Yue was very smart. She not only knew that Chu Feng had only endured Chu Haoyan’s insults because of her, but she also seemed to understand Chu Feng’s temperament too.

She knew that, with Chu Feng’s temperament, he would’ve already started fighting Chu Haoyan if it wasn’t for her stopping him.

Thinking about it, it was understandable for her to know about Chu Feng’s temperament. After all, she had seen Chu Feng already in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. It was only natural for her to know a bit about Chu Feng’s personality.

Perhaps it was precisely because she knew about Chu Feng’s personality that she ended up stopping him.

“As long as big sis Chu Yue is fine, I, Chu Feng, will not feel any grievance,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

It was a very indifferent smile. It wasn’t that Chu Feng really did not mind the humiliation he had received. Rather... he did not want Chu Yue to worry.

“Little brother Chu Feng, you should enter quickly. Remember, the one on the left is the Life Gate, whereas the one on the right is the Death Gate. You must enter the Death Gate,” Chu Yue said.

“In that case, you’re planning to enter the Life Gate?” Chu Feng asked.

“Mn, the Life Gate is different from the Death Gate. I do not possess the strength to enter the Death Gate.”

“As for the actual differences, I will tell you about it later. Right now, we must enter them immediately. Otherwise... I might end up losing the opportunity to obtain the qualifications,” Chu Yue said.

After saying those words, Chu Yue grew anxious.

“Very well, let us enter together.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he grabbed Chu Yue and started flying toward the open gate.

At that moment, only four figures had entered the so-called Death Gate. They were Chu Lingxi, Chu Ruoshi, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.

Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu were currently walking alongside one another.

“Chu Huanyu, with how useless that Chu Feng is, why didn’t you take care of him before?” Chu Haoyan spoke very proudly. He seemed to be flaunting to Chu Huanyu how he had successfully humiliated Chu Feng.

As for Chu Huanyu, his expression turned stern. He said, “Although I, more than anyone else, detest that Chu Feng, but Chu Haoyan, I must remind you that Chu Feng is not as simple as you imagine him to be. It would be best for you to prepare yourself.”

“What preparation?” Chu Haoyan asked.

“Prepare yourself to be taken care of by him,” Chu Huanyu said.

“Hahaha. Me, being taken care of by him? Very well, I’ll wait. I will wait for that trash to come take care of me. Hahaha.”

“Chu Huanyu, oh Chu Huanyu, have you trained yourself stupid after being out training for so long? You’re actually saying that trash like that will be able to take care of me?”

Chu Haoyan was laughing complacently. It was as if he had heard a very ridiculous joke.

Seeing such a Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu’s expression changed. He said, “Remember, you’ve been warned.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Huanyu hastened his speed.
