Chapter 5794: Plundering Bloodline

Hundreds of ferocious beasts around the size of little hills lay orderly in the sky. They were chained to a war chariot that spanned over a thousand meters in length, but the space inside the war chariot wasn’t just a mere thousand meters. It was majestic and grand like a massive palace.

In the highest room of the palace was a golden-armored elder who stood with his hands behind his back.

Behind him were dozens of people dressed in golden armor. Some of them were old, whereas some of them were middle-aged, but all of them emanated formidable auras. They were all late True God level cultivators.

Yet, all of them stood subserviently behind the golden-armored elder, for this golden-armored elder was one of the strongest individuals in the current world of cultivation—the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master, Yuwen Yanri’s grandfather.

“It’s fortunate Jie Tianran made a misjudgment. It’s already a hassle dealing with Jie Tianran and Jie Ranqing. It’d be a disaster if we have to deal with Chu Feng on top of that,” the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master remarked.

“Lord Mansion Master, Jie Tianran has now witnessed Chu Feng’s talent. Is there a chance he might change his mind and take Chu Feng under their wing?” an elder asked.

“He won’t. I know Jie Tianran. He won’t retract his decision,” the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

“But what if he lowers his head?” the elder asked.

The Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master was silent for a moment before replying, “We’d have no choice but to serve the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion then.”

The faces of the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s experts turned grim, as they knew their Mansion Master wasn’t exaggerating the direness of the situation.

Jie Tianran and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were difficult enough to deal with, and Jie Ranqing had displayed exceptional talent back in her active years. Yet, Chu Feng’s talent clearly surpassed that of Jie Ranqing’s.

If Chu Feng joined the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, it could resolve the conflict between Jie Tianran and Jie Ranqing, making them more united than ever. With the three of them propping the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, no one in the world of cultivation would dare to defy them.

The other powers wouldn’t be able to curb their rise even if they joined hands.

…

“Heh… Hahaha… Hahahahaha!” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master suddenly laughed maniacally.

This was the first time the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had acted so inappropriately in public. They couldn’t understand what had happened to that lofty powerhouse who always seemed to have everything under control.

Just as the crowd was wondering if the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had been driven mad by regret, the latter suddenly retracted his smile and looked at Chu Feng with vicious eyes.

“Chu Feng, the reason you were able to conquer the Genesis Bloodline is due to our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Ruler’s Bloodline.”

“You’re wrong. I received my Ruler’s Bloodline from my mother. It has nothing to do with your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Chu Feng sneered.

“Even your mother’s Ruler’s Bloodline was bestowed upon her by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

Chu Feng couldn’t be bothered to argue over the semantics. He knew deep well that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion didn’t have the Ruler’s Bloodline before Jie Ranqing. She was the first one to possess the Ruler’s Bloodline.

“You won’t be gleeful for long, Chu Feng. Everything you have came from our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It’s only a matter of time before we reclaim our property. I’m not just talking about the Genesis Bloodline but your Ruler’s Bloodline too. Just like what I did to your mother, I’ll personally take away your everything.”

The crowd was taken aback.

Chu Feng also lost his earlier composure. His eyebrows shot up as he asked, “What do you mean? What did you do my mother?”

“Jie Ranqing received everything she had from our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but she dared to betray us. I spared her life on the account that she’s my daughter, but I can’t unjustly side with her as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. I have already taken away Jie Ranqing’s Ruler’s Bloodline, and she’s now nothing more than a cripple.”

The crowd couldn’t believe what they had just heard.

Jie Ranqing, a prodigy who dominated an era, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master's most beloved daughter, had her Ruler’s Bloodline taken away? Was there a need for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master to go that far?

He was weakening the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s fighting prowess here!

The crowd found those words hard to believe even though they had come straight from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

“Jie Tianran, there’s no need to spew such lies to agitate me,” Chu Feng said seethingly.

He had been through many storms and wouldn’t be angered that easily, but this matter concerned his mother. It was hard for him to maintain his composure here. In fact, he had been worried about his mother’s safety all this while.

This made him panic.

“Lies? Chu Feng, do you think I’d lower myself to lie to you? You aren’t qualified for that. You and your father are the culprits who made Jie Ranqing lose her bloodline. I gave her a choice back then. She could have chosen to preserve her kinship, honor, bright future, and everything she had. She would have still been my pride and glory. Yet, she obstinately chose you. It’s all because of you! Chu Feng, you and your father ruined Ranqing! You are the culprits!”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master flicked his wrist and took out a blood-red dagger.

“Lord Mansion Master?”

The crowd standing next to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master looked nervous.

“Do you dare not stand your ground with me?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked with narrowed eyes.

The elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion flicked their wrists and drew blood-red daggers too.

Those who had once met Jie Ranqing fell into a daze upon seeing those blood-red daggers, for they could sense Jie Ranqing’s aura on those daggers.

Chu Feng was stunned as well. He was reminded of the Ancient Realm’s illusory formation, where he witnessed his mother’s bloodline being taken away from her. The daggers he saw in his illusory formation were identical to the ones held by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master and elders.

“Do you see this, Chu Feng? I ripped out your mother’s Ruler’s Bloodline with this dagger, and I’ll take away your Ruler’s Bloodline with it. Your mother had a choice back then, but you don’t have the same privilege. Your fate has been sealed from the start. I’ll take away everything that doesn’t belong to you.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master coldly eyed Chu Feng.

The elders inside the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s war chariot turned their sights to their Mansion Master.

“Lord Mansion Master, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master must be lying, right? He doted on Jie Ranqing so much back then. There’s no way he could bring himself to take away Jie Ranqing’s Ruler’s Bloodline.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The elders couldn’t believe what they were hearing.

“You don’t know Jie Tianran, so you don’t know how obsessed he is over his loyalty to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. There’s nothing he wouldn’t do for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It’s probably true if he’s announcing it in public. How foolish. Jie Tianran has grown arrogant. However, his foolishness is our blessing.”

The Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. He lamented Jie Ranqing’s fate, as he didn’t think a prodigy of her caliber should have fallen like this, but at the same time, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Without Jie Ranqing to support the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, the other powers still stood a chance against them. Their fates weren’t sealed yet.

Boom boom boom!

Chu Feng released a nine-colored lightning that enveloped the sky and shrouded his body.

“I’ll kill you!”
