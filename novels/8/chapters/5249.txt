Chapter 5249: I Am the Legacy

“Who is it?”

Chu Feng quickly turned around, only to see no one behind him. He quickly activated the main token to remove all restrictions on the mountain range’s formation, planning to make his escape.

He thought that the person who had just spoken to him was another one of Yue Lian’s subordinates.

“Don’t worry, I am not with them,” the voice sounded once more.

At the same time, Chu Feng found himself bound by a surge of energy.

“Who are you, elder?” Chu Feng asked.

“There’s an outsider here, so I can’t show myself just yet. Give me a moment,” the female voice said.

Weng!

An isolation formation with concealment properties rose from the ground, enveloping the mountain range’s formation.

The mountain range’s formation was already terrifying as it was, but the one that was currently being formed over it was many times more powerful.

“I was discovered?” a woman floating in the sky murmured under her breath.

It was the mysterious woman whom Chu Feng had met inside the mountain valley. She had been tailing Chu Feng in recent days.

She was able to breach the mountain range’s formation without any trouble, but the same couldn’t be said about the one currently forming over it. It was so powerful that she couldn’t even peer into it, let alone breach it.

“Who is it?”

Realizing that there was someone even stronger than her here, the mysterious woman frowned.

Inside the formation, Chu Feng was freed from the energy binding him.

Before him stood a woman wearing a violet dress. Her demeanor exuded loftiness, and it looked as if nothing in the world could catch her eye. Yet, she was looking at Chu Feng with a gentle smile.

“Not bad. Ruler’s Bloodline?” the woman asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

He didn’t think that there was any need to lie to an expert of the other party’s caliber. Even though she wasn’t emanating any pressure whatsoever, he could feel an air of extreme danger from her. If she wanted to, she could have killed him as easily as squashing an ant.

“You even picked up the bare basics of Lord Qin Jiu’s skills,” the woman remarked.

“You know Lord Qin Jiu?” Chu Feng asked with widened eyes.

“Oh? You have heard of Lord Qin Jiu?”

“I have heard of his name.”

“Did you hear it from the person who taught you?”

“Elder, you’re able to tell that my world spiritist techniques are from Lord Qin Jiu?”

“Of course,” the woman replied with a nod.

Chu Feng was overjoyed to hear that. The legacy of Yue Ling’s ancestors indeed originated from Lord Qin Jiu.

Knowing that the woman before him likely knew a thing or two about Lord Qin Jiu, Chu Feng wanted to ask her question, only for the other party to beat him to it.

“Are you interested in acquiring Lord Qin Jiu’s true legacy?” the woman asked.

“Elder, you know where it is?” Chu Feng asked in disbelief.

It went without saying that he wanted to obtain Lord Qin Jiu’s true legacy, but he couldn’t believe that there was something as convenient as this in the world. It was as if a gift delivered right to his doorstep.

“I do. It is right here,” the woman said as she pointed to her own bosom.

“Is Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy in your heart?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m saying that I am Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy!” the woman scoffed.

“You’re the legacy? How is that possible? Elder, you should stop pulling my leg,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.

The woman’s smile deepened.

Weng!

The woman suddenly turned into a gush of smoke that swiftly manifested into a majestic violet palace. It was covered in unique patterns that resembled the woman’s violet dress. The palace doors slowly creaked open. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Come in,” the woman’s voice echoed from within the palace.

“Is this for real?”

Chu Feng was baffled, but he did as he was told.

The first thing he noticed upon entering the palace was that the walls were covered in runes. He immediately knew that the runes were the legacy. As long as he comprehended the runes, he would be able to obtain the legacy.

“Elder, this… is Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy?” Chu Feng asked.

“What else do you think?” the woman replied as she manifested beside Chu Feng.

“Elder, what I mean is that am I allowed to decipher the legacy straightaway? Is there no tests or trials that I have to undergo first?” Chu Feng asked.

He could already tell that this legacy was much more formidable than what Yue Ling’s ancestors had left behind. There was not a sliver of doubt in his mind that this was the real legacy, which was also why he found the situation unbelievable.

After all, he had always had to brave many dangers before obtaining legacies or treasures in the past, so it was hard for him to believe just how easily this legacy fell into his hands.

“I can prepare a test for you if that’s what you want,” the woman said.

“There’s no need for that!” Chu Feng quickly shook his head.

The woman burst into laughter. Despite her lofty appearance, she seemed to have a hearty personality.

“I’m just joking with you. Look at this.”

The woman opened up her palm, revealing a little violet tower that was shining with sacred light. More importantly, it was emanating the aura of the Ancient Era.

“Lord Qin Jiu has ordered to wait here for the arrival of an eligible successor. He has left me with many ways to evaluate the successor. Indeed, those who are chosen would usually have to undergo multiple trials, and even so, the legacy they acquire won’t be complete. However, if someone manages to light up this tower, they will be eligible to acquire the complete legacy without undergoing any trials… and you happen to be in that category,” the woman explained.

“Is it because I have the Ruler’s Bloodline?” Chu Feng asked.

“Are you asking me? How am I supposed to know that? I don’t know how this tower works either. I’m just following orders here,” the woman said.

“Elder, am I allowed to decipher the legacy now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. Just a reminder, it won’t be easy to comprehend the legacy. You can give it a try first, but I suggest that you take things slow. There’s no need to rush. I have waited here for so many years that a few more decades isn’t an issue. If you really require centuries for it, I guess I can try to rein in my impatience and wait for you… but a thousand years is the longest I’m willing to wait. I do want to go out and have fun too,” the woman said.

“All right, I’ll give it a try.”

Chu Feng began examining the runes on the walls.

This legacy was also hard to comprehend but in a different manner. The legacy left behind by Yue Ling’s ancestors was prepared specifically for the descendants of the Yue Clan, making it difficult for outsiders like Chu Feng to comprehend it.

On the other hand, this legacy seemed to be prepared specifically for Chu Feng. The sheer amount of content in the legacy still posed a challenge nevertheless, but it was not beyond Chu Feng’s means to grasp it.

Through studying the legacy, Chu Feng received a complete paradigm shift toward formation deciphering methods.

He had already gotten a peek into the various formation deciphering methods from the legacy left behind by Yue Ling’s ancestors, but he knew that what he had grasped thus far was only the tip of the iceberg. But right now, he felt like the iceberg was slowly rising from the water, revealing itself in its full glory before him.

Two hours passed in a flash.

Chu Feng took a deep breath before turning to the woman.

“How is it? Tough? Do you need a sip of water?” the woman asked with a smile.

“You’re too kind, elder. Speaking of which, how should I address you?” Chu Feng asked.

“Me? I don’t have a name,” the woman replied.

“You don’t have a name?” Chu Feng was surprised.

“Is it that surprising? I was born as a natural oddity, and Lord Qin Jiu borrowed my strength to construct this formation. You can say that I am this legacy formation, so it shouldn’t be that surprising that I don’t have a name,” the woman replied.

“You’re this legacy formation?”

Chu Feng found it hard to believe. This was the first time he had encountered a legacy formation that not only possessed sentience but also unfathomable strength!

“Indeed. However, I am also a lifeform too,” the woman replied with a chuckle.

She didn’t seem uncomfortable with the fact that she was a formation. If anything, she was proud of it.

“Elder, why didn’t you come up with a name for yourself?” Chu Feng asked.

“Are names that important?” the woman asked.

“If you don’t mind, why don’t I call you Elder Fairy Sister? While I don’t know how old you are, just from outer appearances, you appear to be of a similar age as me. Of course, if you don’t like it, I can also continue calling you elder,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

For some reason, he felt comfortable with that woman, which was why he was being much more sociable than usual.

“Elder Fairy Sister? Am I that good-looking?” the woman asked with a chuckle.

“Judging from your appearance and your disposition, I wouldn’t be surprised if you told me that you were a fairy,” Chu Feng replied.

“You do have a glib tongue.” The woman’s smile brightened. “I do like that name, but I’m much older than you. It wouldn’t be appropriate for you to call me sister. Well, since I’m wearing a violet dress, why don’t you call me Elder Violet instead?” the woman asked.

“Junior Chu Feng pays respects to Elder Violet!”

Chu Feng quickly bowed deeply to the woman.

“Don’t bother flattering me. I can’t help you with this legacy either. You’ll have to comprehend it by yourself,” the woman said.

“Elder, I’m not trying to flatter you. I have earnestly grateful to you,” Chu Feng replied.

“Really?” The woman narrowed her eyes in skepticism.

“Of course. I have already grasped the legacy,” Chu Feng replied.

“I see.” The woman perfunctorily nodded her head, only to freeze in shock a moment later. She turned her gaze back to Chu Feng and asked, “You said that you have grasped legacy?”

“I did,” Chu Feng replied.

“How much of it?” the woman asked.

“All of it.”

“That’s impossible.” The woman shook her head in disbelief.
