MGA: Chapter 1818 - Scum King Monstrous Dragon Beast

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at the moment when Chu Feng and the others were about to enter the King Monstrous Dragon Beast’s territory, six figures suddenly rapidly flew toward them from the distant horizon and descended before them.

They were King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. They were returning from a long journey, and were currently covered in dust. Among them was a face that Chu Feng recognized. It was the King Monstrous Dragon Beast representative he had met in the Gong Ba Plains’ fort, Yaojiao Tinglei, Yaojiao Guang’s ninety-sixth son.

“Brother Chu Feng, we meet again. You have truly broadened our horizons and brought face to us members of the younger generation.”

After greeting Yaojiao Guang, Baili Xuankong and the others respectfully, Yaojiao Tinglei began to call out to Chu Feng with a smile on his face. Furthermore, the expression that he wore when he looked to Chu Feng was an expression of admiration.

In fact, it was not only him. Even the five Martial Emperors that arrived alongside him were looking at Chu Feng with expressions of idolization on their faces.

Had it been before, people of their status would definitely not have reacted in such a manner. However, after they personally saw Chu Feng’s abilities on the Gong Ba Plains, they knew very well that the young man before them possessed the qualifications for them to feel admiration towards him.

“Prince, you are flattering me,” Chu Feng replied modestly.

“My, you don’t have to address me as prince. If you don’t mind, you can address me directly as Tinglei,” Yaojiao Tinglei said.

“Brother Tinglei,” Chu Feng greeted again. Then, he asked, “How was the situation in the Gong Ba Plains after we left? Did Snow-haired Immortal and Compass Immortal manage...”

“I know what you’re worried about. Rest assured. After you were saved by our Utmost Exalted Elder, the Snow-haired Immortal and the Compass Immortal both escaped. As for the Four Clans, they did not dare to chase after them.”

“The Four Great Imperial Clans wracked their brains to meticulously plan your capture. However, in the end, they suffered a crushing defeat. Haha. You weren’t there to see it when the people from the Four Great Imperial Clans were being ridiculed by the crowd. They had truly and utterly disgraced themselves. Thus, they did not stay, and instead left in a dejected manner.”

Yaojiao Tinglei said with a carefree expression. At the same time as he described what had happened to Chu Feng, he had also revealed to Chu Feng that the person who saved him before was also a King Monstrous Dragon Beast. Merely, it seemed that his status was even higher than that of Yaojiao Guang. He was actually their Utmost Exalted Elder.

After hearing what Yaojiao Tinglei said, Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang both started to smile. As for Chu Feng, he felt relieved.

“Tinglei, you’ve returned at the perfect time. I still have some matters that I wish to mention to the elders. Go and take Chu Feng, as well as the other two sirs, to the Distinguished Guest Palace Hall to rest,” Yaojiao Guang said.

“Father, please rest assured, I will definitely entertain the two seniors and Brother Chu Feng properly,” Then, Yaojiao Tinglei led Chu Feng, Hong Qiang and Baili Xuankong to the Distinguished Guest Palace Hall to rest.

Although the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were monstrous beasts, their castle walls and buildings imitated those of human constructions.

Furthermore, for the sake of being visually pleasing, many of the forts had been created with pure gold, and ornamented with natural treasures. They were truly dazzling sights, truly luxurious.

However, this sort of dazzling sight was truly a bit excessive. Chu Feng, Hong Qiang and Baili Xuankong were all unable to appreciate them. It would seem that the taste for art between humans and monstrous beasts was still a bit different.

“Yoh, this must be that human race’s genius, Chu Feng, right?”

However, not long after Chu Feng and the others were seated in the palace hall, a group of people appeared. It was a large group of people; there were Martial Emperor-level experts among them. However, only ten people entered the palace hall.

These ten people were all part of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts’ younger generation. There were men and women among them, and they all had humanoid appearances. Their leader was a man with the cultivation of a rank eight Half Martial Emperor. Merely, the gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng was filled with hostility.

Of course, the gaze with which he looked to Yaojiao Tinglei was also filled with the same sort of hostility.

“Yaojiao Xueran, why have you come here? Can you not see that I am entertaining distinguished guests?”

“With your status, this is not a place that you can enter as you please,” Yaojiao Tinglei berated.

“Yoh, yoh, yoh, Ninety-sixth Prince, what arrogance you have here. However, you should know very well that you will not be able to continue to be prince for long. Thus, it’s best that you pay attention to the way you talk to me. For I... will be your master in the future.”

Yaojiao Xueran started to poke at Yaojiao Tinglei’s chest repeatedly. He was acting extremely impudent.

“Yaojiao Xueran, you are still not the Clan Chief yet. As a member of the younger generation, you are required to greet me respectfully upon seeing me. Not only have you not done so, you have actually dared to threaten and provoke me. Do you not fear that I will punish you?” At this moment, Yaojiao Tinglei was furious.

“Punish me? With merely you? Or is it that you want them to punish me?” As Yaojiao Xueran said those words, he turned his gaze to the guards in the palace hall.

However, all the guards that were met with Yaojiao Xueran’s gaze immediately shifted their gaze away. They all knew that Yaojiao Xueran was going to become the next Clan Chief. Thus, how could they possibly dare to disrespect him?

“Lord Prince, it would seem that you have no power whatsoever. No one is even willing to listen to you anymore. Heh... punish me? Someone like you is unqualified,” Yaojiao Xueran mocked and ridiculed with a smile on his face.

As for Yaojiao Tinglei, he was so enraged that his complexion turned deep red, and his veins bulged violently. However, he could do nothing other than endure in silence.

Although his father was the Clan Chief of the King Monstrous Dragon Race, everyone knew that Yaojiao Xueran would become the next Clan Chief.

Should Yaojiao Xueran become the next Clan Chief, it would mean that the War Faction would gain control of the King Monstrous Dragon Race. At that time, they, the people from the Peace Faction would all end up suffering. If they were to dare to go against Yaojiao Xueran at such a time, their days in the future would become even more unendurable.

Thus, Yaojiao Tinglei did not blame those guards. As the facts were before their eyes, there was nothing that they could do.

“Oh, that’s right. You said that I am still not yet the Clan Chief. I know what you’re thinking.”

“You’re thinking that your little sister will still have the chance to become the Clan Chief of our King Monstrous Dragon Race, isn’t that right? Furthermore, that will all be dependent on that human. That Chu Feng will be your savior, isn’t that right?” After saying those words, Yaojiao Xueran took a glance at Chu Feng again and smiled disdainfully.

“I might as well tell you this. Your little sister is hopeless. How could a mere human possibly activate the Inheritance Pond? For the sake of obtaining the position of Clan Chief, you all actually went to request help from a human. You have truly shamed our King Monstrous Dragon Race,” Yaojiao Xueran said to Yaojiao Tinglei. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Even if my little sister is incapable of obtaining Lord Dragon King’s inheritance, she is still the only one of us to ever be able to step into the Inheritance Pond. She is much more powerful than you. Sooner or later, she will surpass you,” Yaojiao Tinglei said.

“I know that she’ll surpass me. But what about it? At that time, I will have already become the King Monstrous Dragon Race’s Clan Chief. I will hold a position so high and above her, that even if she were to surpass me, she would still have to listen to my commands and work for me.”

“However, you do not have to worry for your little sister. After all, she is the person with the greatest talent since Lord Dragon King. I will let her live a very good life.”

“I have already decided. On the day that I become Clan Chief, I will request that the elders marry your little sister to me,” Yaojiao Xueran said.

“Yaojiao Xueran, you are truly a scoundrel. As a princess, how could my sister possibly marry you to become your concubine?” Yaojiao Tinglei was incomparably furious. The reason for that was because Yaojiao Xueran was already married. Not only did he have a wife, he also possessed close to a hundred concubines.

If his little sister were to marry Yaojiao Xueran, she would only become a concubine.

Furthermore, Yaojiao Xueran was extremely unfaithful. He had pursued Yaojiao Tingyu many times, only to be refused by her every time. Furthermore, Yaojiao Tingyu had requested that their father punish Yaojiao Xueran before.

This Yaojiao Xueran already harbored hard feelings for her. If Yaojiao Tingyu were to really marry him, she would definitely be miserable.

However, most helplessly, if Yaojiao Xueran were to really become the Clan Chief, the elders would definitely agree to his request. At that time, his little sister would have no other choice but to marry him.

“Truth be told, your little sister is only qualified to be my concubine. However, rest assured, I will make sure that she’ll be extremely happy. She’ll remain very noble outside. However, when she’s with me, she’ll be my sex slave. Hahaha,” After saying those words, Yaojiao Xueran looked to the sky and burst into loud and shameless laughter.

Unable to contain himself, Chu Feng said, “Never would I have expected that there would be such scum even among the King Monstrous Dragon Race. My eyes have truly been opened today.”
