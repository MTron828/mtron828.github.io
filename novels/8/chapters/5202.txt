Chapter 5202: A Gift From My Mother

Chu Feng was overjoyed.

He completely disregarded the current fight and projected his consciousness into his World Spirit Space. There, he found an incredibly beautiful woman waiting for him. She had fair skin, an amazing physique, and a flawless face.

Practically all compliments that were used to compliment a woman’s looks could be used on her.

She was none other than Milady Queen, Eggy.

“Eggy, you’re finally awake!”

Chu Feng could hardly curb his smile at all. It was rare for him to let his emotions show so openly on his face. He wasn’t even this happy when he took control of the Asura World Spirit Army.

“You fool, why did you come in here? Hurry up and open your world spirit gate. I’ll deal with Xue Ji for you. I won’t let her off for daring to bully you today.”

Eggy was overjoyed about her reunion with Chu Feng as well, but she showed a displeased expression as soon as Xue Ji came into the conversation. A tinge of killing intent could be felt from her as her cultivation flared.

“Rank eight Martial Exalted level? Did you manage to fully refine the Asura God-Demon Stone?”

Chu Feng stared at Eggy in bewilderment.

“Yes, I’ve fully refined it. How is it? My improvement isn’t too bad, right? It’s lucky I got the Asura God-Demon Stone, or else I’d have been left in the dust. You’re growing too quickly,” Eggy said with curled eyes.

Her smile was still as sweet as ever. Chu Feng felt like his heart was going to melt.

In truth, Eggy hadn’t been hibernating for a long time. It was just that he was too used to her accompaniment that he couldn’t help feeling lonely when she wasn’t around. That made him subconsciously think that she had been gone for a long time.

But now, what he was more worried about was whether Eggy was able to best Xue Ji in a battle.

“Eggy, Xue Ji might only be at rank seven Martial Exalted level, but she has the ability to surmount four cultivation ranks.”

Chu Feng remembered that Eggy had the power to surmount two cultivation ranks back when she was at rank one Martial Exalted level, and one’s heaven-defying battle power was usually decided upon reaching a specific cultivation level.

Even if Eggy had a huge breakthrough in the meantime, rising from rank one Martial Exalted level to rank eight Martial Exalted level, she would still be weaker than Xue Ji in terms of absolute fighting prowess.

“Chu Feng, it’s not too late for you to submit to me right now,” Xue Ji said.

She noticed that Chu Feng hadn’t been reacting for some time and thought that he was considering her offer.

“Did you hear that? She’s calling for you. Hurry up and open the world spirit gate. This queen shall put her back in place on your behalf,” Eggy urged.

“Eggy, are you sure about that?”

Chu Feng was still worried about this.

“Why are you being so wishy-washy? When have I ever disappointed you?” Eggy asked.

“I guess not,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Eggy had indeed never disappointed him before. If not for her, he wouldn’t have been able to come this far.

Thus, he put aside his hesitation and decided to believe in Eggy. He retracted his consciousness back into his main body and opened the world spirit gate.

“Why? Are you going to try bringing Yu Sha out to convince me? It’s useless, Chu Feng. No one can change my mind,” Xue Ji said.

“Hah! What arrogance!”

Eggy stepped out from the world spirit gate.

Surprisingly, Chu Feng’s first reaction upon Eggy’s entrance was not the upcoming fight between the two ladies. Rather, he found himself enchanted by the two beauties before him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Eggy and Xue Ji were both top-notch beauties, but they were of different types. Eggy had an excellent physique, but she retained the appearance of an innocent and adorable girl. Her youthfulness truly invoked one’s desire to protect her.

On the other hand, Xue Ji was sexy and seductive, reminiscent of a temptress seeking to steal away men’s souls.

There were no women who wouldn’t pale in comparison before them.

“Little girl, it’s been a long time. Chu Feng is finally willing to let you cross blows with me?”

Xue Ji revealed a deep smile upon seeing Eggy.

“Xue Ji. I’ll have a fight with you. If I win, you shall return the blue rock you took from Chu Feng. If I lose, all of these Asura God Stones will be yours. Chu Feng will harvest them for you,” Eggy said.

“Fine.”

Xue Ji accepted the offer.

Shoosh shoosh!

Eggy waved her hands, and a massive scythe appeared before her. That was the weapon that Chu Feng had given her, Death God’s Edge.

Somehow, it didn’t look out of place for someone as innocent as Eggy to be wielding the Death God’s Edge. On the contrary, it created a striking visual contrast.

“Don’t say that I’m taking advantage of you. I’ll suppress my cultivation to rank seven Martial Exalted level too,” Eggy said.

Her cultivation began to regress from rank eight Martial Exalted level to rank seven.

“Eggy, you…”

Chu Feng was worried to see that, but he chose not to say anything after seeing the confident look on Eggy’s face. He believed that she knew what she was doing.

“Little girl, looks like you’re confident. You should know that I have no plans of holding back against you.”

Xue Ji narrowed her eyes sharply.

Shoosh!

Xue Ji suddenly vanished into thin air. By the time she appeared once more, she was already right in front of Eggy with her sword raised up high, ready to hack down on her.

Chu Feng was taken aback.

Xue Ji was so fast that even he was having trouble reacting to her movements.

Is this… Xue Ji’s true strength?

At the same time, Chu Feng realized that the army behind Xue Ji had vanished without a trace. They had morphed into a powerful surge of gaseous flame that gushed back into Xue Ji’s body. It turned out that the army was nothing more than a feint. The one who was truly strong here was still none other than Xue Ji herself.

That was why Xue Ji was able to move at such an alarming speed.

Yet, Eggy was still able to block the swift offense with her Death God’s Edge. Her hand didn’t even tremble in the least against the powerful sword hack.

She had wrapped her gaseous flame around her like her armor, enhancing her strength, but that wouldn’t have been enough for her to block Xue Ji’s attack.

“Eggy is also capable of surmounting four cultivation ranks too?” Chu Feng exclaimed excitedly.

That explained why Eggy was willing to suppress her cultivation to rank seven Martial Exalted level to fight with Xue Ji. It turned out that Eggy was confident of dealing with her.

“As expected of you, Eggy!” Chu Feng said proudly.

If Eggy hadn’t suppressed her cultivation, Xue Ji wouldn’t even have been a match for her at all. It turned out that Eggy was still as strong as ever, walking ahead of Chu Feng as she usually did.

“How meaningless. I thought that you would send your army at me so that we can play a little longer, but you ended up using it as nothing more than a means to raise your fighting prowess.”

Eggy didn’t counterattack right away. Instead, she looked at Xue Ji with a provocative smile. She had been displeased with Xue Ji for a long time now because of Chu Feng.

Xue Ji had tried snatching Chu Feng from her once, and she still hadn’t given up now.

Eggy wouldn’t allow anyone else other than her to lay claim to Chu Feng. She was the only one in the world who was allowed to bully Chu Feng.

“Little girl, it looks like you still don’t understand the situation you’re in. I’m fighting you close up so that you can have a taste of my sword!” Xue Ji replied with a sinister smile.

She brandished her sword toward Eggy once more, harnessing far greater speed and strength than when she was fighting with Chu Feng.

“Be careful, Eggy! Her sword is laced with poison!” Chu Feng shouted out.

“I know that. You don’t have to worry. I’ll consider my loss if her sword nicks me at all!” Eggy replied with absolute confidence.

Boom!

Following Eggy’s words, a strong wind whipped up and blew Chu Feng away to a safe place. She had carefully controlled the wind so as to ensure that it wouldn’t hurt him.

After Chu Feng finally regained his balance, his eyes widened in shock at the sight before him.

“The hell.”

He realized that he couldn’t clearly see the battle between Eggy and Xue Ji at all even though he should have been equal to them in terms of cultivation rank. Yet, the two women were clearly displaying fighting prowess far beyond him.

This difference couldn’t just be attributed to the decrease in his fighting prowess as a result of the forced impartation of cultivation from God’s Contract when he obtained the Asura World Spirit Army. Even if it wasn’t for that, he was certain that he wouldn’t be a match for Eggy and Xue Ji without unleashing the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.

“Asura World Spirits are truly frightening.”

Chu Feng didn’t know whether all Asura World Spirits were as formidable as Eggy and Xue Ji, but the fighting prowess they were displaying here was indubitably superior to his.

“It’s no wonder why my mother would place the two of them in my World Spirit Space. She must have probably chosen them with great care,” Chu Feng murmured to himself.

But again, it wasn’t that surprising considering that Eggy and Xue Ji were his mother’s gift to him.
