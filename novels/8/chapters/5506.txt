Chapter 5506: An Uninvited Guest

Chu Feng realized that the Cosmos Sack was filled with pills, from those that healed injuries to those that raised spirit power and cultivation. They were all worth a king’s ransom.

The Cosmos Sack even contained a hundred Dragon Inner Pills, an exclusive pill that was only made available to the prodigies of the Totem Dragon Clan. It was with the energy from the Dragon Inner Pill that Chu Feng overcame his bottleneck and advanced to Half-God level.

Admittedly, the Dragon Inner Pill was no longer as useful to Chu Feng anymore, but this showed the sincerity of the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Elder, this is too much. You can always compensate me afterward too.” Chu Feng tried to return the Cosmos Sack.

“Young friend Chu Feng, this is the compensation you deserve, regardless of whether you succeed or fail,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Accept it, Chu Feng,” Long Chengyu urged.

“Thank you, elder.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Chu Feng accepted the gift. Those pills were invaluable, after all. They would be of great help to him.

“There’s no need to stand on ceremony, young friend Chu Feng. I’ll be counting on you,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Elder Clan Chief, you’re too polite. I’m close friends with Brother Chengyu and Miss Muxi. I’d accompany them even if not for compensation. Speaking of which, Elder Clan Chief, may I ask where did those tokens come from?” Chu Feng asked.

While he didn’t see the beam of light, he could tell that the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t know what was going on. In spite of that, he was still telling his clan’s juniors to enter the gate and complete an incomplete formation. Given the odd situation, the likeliest possibility was that he had received a request from someone.

If that was the case, the token must have come from the requester too. It was also likely that the requester knew a thing or two about what was going on here.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I brought you and the other juniors here because of a request from someone else, but I’m afraid that I can’t divulge that person’s identity. Those tokens came from the requester. It was only just a moment ago that I received the request details and the tokens,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Elder Clan Chief, does that mean that you have already told us everything you know?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right.” The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief nodded.

There was nothing else Chu Feng could ask under such circumstances, given that the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was unwilling to divulge the requester’s identity. All he could do now was to proceed with the mission.

“Father, should we make a move now?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Go ahead. Remember, your safety comes first. You must also maintain your confidentiality when carrying out this mission. Make sure you conceal yourself before entering the path,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief instructed.

“Understood,” the juniors answered.

The group invoked the powerful concealment energy imbued in the token before making their way toward the path. Thanks to the token, they were able to enter the path without an issue. Surprisingly, they didn’t sense any pressure on the Immemorial Star Sea on the path.

Chu Feng and the others initially proceeded carefully, but they soon hastened their footsteps upon realizing that they were impervious to the desert’s pressure while walking on this path.

The closer they approached the door, the more they could sense how extraordinary it was.

“What a formidable formation!” Chu Feng remarked.

While he couldn’t tell what kind of place the gate led to, he could sense how formidable it was. The energy contained within that gate’s formation was far beyond his reach even though he was already a God-cloak World Spiritist.

There was always a higher mountain out there.

Even though Chu Feng’s capabilities were already astounding to most, he still felt powerless before the formation. The gate was so high that it extended beyond the sky’s boundary, inducing gasps from the Totem Dragon Clan’s juniors. This was perplexing, given how they could see the top of the gate earlier when they were still a distance away.

What they had seen previously was probably just an illusion, whereas this was the real deal.

“Is this the Immemorial Star Sea’s fortuitous encounter? Even its gate is something to behold!” Long Chengyu exclaimed.

The other Totem Dragon Clansmen could hardly conceal their excitement either.

Even though the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had already warned them that there would be dangers inside, they were still looking forward to uncovering what was in that humongous gate.

“Hm?”

Chu Feng suddenly halted his footsteps, and the other juniors followed suit too. After everything they had been through, they no longer doubted his judgment.

Long Chengyu stepped forward and asked, “What’s wrong, Chu Feng?”

“There’s a formation here. Let me take a look first.” Chu Feng stepped forward to inspect the formation. He noticed that he could pass through the formation without an issue. “It’s a special region, but we should be able to walk through it.”

He took the lead and entered the formation, only to freeze up the next instant.

Both the token and his own concealment means suddenly dissipated upon entering the special region, but what shocked him more was that there was another group inside the special region.

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen.

Feng Tiansheng and Feng Jiuyue, who was previously in the Demon Crane, were here too.

“What are you doing here?” Feng Tiansheng, Feng Jiuyue, and the others stared at Chu Feng in astonishment.

Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, and the others stepped into the formation too. They quickly noticed that the other party was carrying the same tokens, which informed them why the other party was here too. Clearly, they were here to accomplish the same mission.

“Are we working with the Totem Phoenix Clan, or are they our competitors?” Long Shanshan asked.

None of the Totem Dragon Clan’s juniors knew who the requester was, so they couldn’t tell whether the Totem Phoenix Clan was a friend or a foe.

“They must have received the same request, but I don’t think that we are working together. Father would have told me about them otherwise. Let’s follow my father’s instructions later when we enter the gate. As long as they don’t provoke us, we can just ignore them.”

Long Chengyu had sent the message via voice transmission. He was the only one in the group who knew that the requester was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, but he kept it a secret from the others, including Chu Feng and Long Muxi, because his father had told him to do so. However, he, too, didn’t know that the Totem Phoenix Clan would be here.

His guess was that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was the one who had invited the Totem Phoenix Clan here. In fact, he was starting to wonder if the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had a hand in the Totem Phoenix Clan’s disappearance many years back.

Weng!

A formation suddenly quivered.

Both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and the Totem Phoenix Clansmen tensed up. Another group of people had entered the formation, but none of them were humans.
