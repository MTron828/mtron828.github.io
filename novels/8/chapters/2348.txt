Chapter 2348 - Finally Meeting The Grandmaster

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he held the Gate Opening Key and arrived at the gate.

Sigh~~~

However, right at the moment when Chu Feng was planning to open the gate, Chu Feng suddenly heard a voice transmission. That sigh was actually from the Gate Opening Key.

“Xiaoshi?” Chu Feng was startled. The reason for that was because that sigh was simply Xiaoshi’s voice.

“Originally, I had planned to personally kill that damned bitch while opening the gate. However, it would appear that I can only rely on you to avenge me in the future,” Sure enough, Xiaoshi’s voice sounded from the Gate Opening Key again.

“Xiaoshi, you’re alive?” Chu Feng asked through voice transmission.

“I am already dead. However, before opening the gate, I possess some more uses. However, that doesn’t matter anymore. Let me just open the gate for you. Remember, there is still a dangerous spirit formation behind the gate.”

“However, as long as the three of you wear those cloaks, you will be able to walk past the dangers. After passing through that spirit formation, you will reach Grandmaster Kai Hong’s remnants,” Xiaoshi’s voice sounded again.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, the Gate Opening Key automatically left Chu Feng’s palm and landed on the gate.

As light shone from it, the two of them fused together.

Immediately after that, rumbles could be heard. The indestructible gate started to slowly open.

At that moment, the people present all revealed excited expressions.

The crowd had been in that place for a very long time. The reason why they were unable to proceed was all because of that gate.

And now, that gate was finally opening. Furthermore, the Gate Opening Key had personally declared that Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance was behind that gate.

Thus, the crowd were all extremely excited. One by one, they were all eagerly waiting for the gate to be opened so that they could rush into it and scramble for Grandmaster Kai Hong’s treasures and inheritance.

“That... that is?!”

However, after that indestructible gate opened, the expressions of joy on the crowd’s face instantly froze.

At that moment, their fiery expressions turned extremely cold.

The reason for that was because what was behind that gate was not Grandmaster Kai Hong’s treasures. Rather, it was a sea of flames, a sea of blue flames.

The blue flames were surging in waves like countless blue fire dragons galloping around.

Although the crowd did not feel a distinct sensation of heat from the blue flames, the crowd felt an aura of death.

This meant that those flames were extremely frightening, and that ordinary people were simply unable to pass through them.

“That sea of flames is truly too frightening. Not to mention us, wouldn’t even a rank one True Immortal be turned into dust upon entering it?”

“How could this be? Wasn’t it decided that Grandmaster Kai Hong’s treasures and inheritance were behind the gate?” At that moment, the crowd felt extreme despair. The reason for that was because they were already certain that, with their strength, it would be impossible for them to pass through that sea of flames.

However, the sea of flames just so happened to seal off their path forward.

“Heh...” At that moment, a cold smile emerged on the World Spiritist Saintess’s face. It was a mocking smile.

The way she saw it, even though the entrance gate had opened, the only people who would be able to obtain the inheritance and gain the most benefits from this would be Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, who held the Gate Opening Key.

However, now that the gate had opened and the Gate Opening Key had disappeared, what appeared before them were not treasures, but rather a fierce blue sea of flames.

No one present was able to pass through that sea of flames. Thus, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were evidently also blocked by the flames.

This caused the World Spiritist Saintess, who had been thwarted repeatedly, to feel better.

“Y-you, w-what a-are you laughing about?” Wang Qiang said in a displeased manner.

“I’m laughing at you all. So what if you’ve obtained the Gate Opening Key and opened the gate? In the end, aren’t you all also blocked like us?” The World Spiritist Saintess declared what she thought in her heart without trying to conceal anything.

“I fear that we’ll have to disappoint you,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, you have a way?” Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang asked in unison.

“Use the cloaks,” Chu Feng said to Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a cloak and draped it over himself.

At that moment, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong understood Chu Feng’s intention. The two of them also took out a cloak and draped it over themselves.

As for those cloaks, they were naturally the cloaks that they’d obtained from Xiaoshi’s instructions. There was also no need to doubt the effects of the cloaks.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were able to reach this place this quickly all because of their cloaks. Wearing the cloaks, they were truly able to avoid all of the traps and mechanisms in the remnants.

“What are they doing?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong all wearing their cloaks, many people revealed confused expressions.

“Those cloaks!!!” However, at that moment, the expressions of the world spiritists present all changed. They were able to tell that the cloaks Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were wearing were no ordinary cloaks. Rather, they were treasures.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong suddenly disappeared.

“Where’d they go? How did they disappear?” Someone cried out in alarm.

“No, they didn’t disappear. Rather, those cloaks are capable of concealing them,” A Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist declared.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, ear-piercing snarls sounded from the edge of the sea of flames. At the same time, flames began to surge toward either direction, revealing a path in the sea of flames.

“They entered?” Seeing that scene, the crowd were all astonished.

“It seems that those cloaks are not only able to conceal them, they are also able to withstand that sea of flames,” That Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist added.

At that moment, the eyes of the crowd present were all brimming with admiration and jealousy.

They all wished to be able to pass through that sea of flames and reach Grandmaster Kai Hong’s remnants like Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

Unfortunately for them, they did not possess a cloak. Thus, they did not dare to take half a step into the sea of flames.

“World Spiritist Saintess, you are fortunate to have not made a bet with little friend Chu Feng this time. Else, you’d have lost again,” The Immortal Sword School’s Elder Duan Chunchang said to the World Spiritist Saintess.

“Damn it!” The World Spiritist Saintess had an unreconciled expression. However, other than feeling unreconciled, there was nothing she could do.

“Grandmaster Prophet is truly amazing. Your prophecy actually managed to completely come true. Little friend Chu Feng is indeed the individual fated to this remnant,” Elder Duan Chunchang said.

At that time, the others also cast their gazes toward Grandmaster Prophet with admiration filled eyes.

As matters stood, Grandmaster Prophet’s prophecy had once again come true.

“Haha...” Grandmaster Prophet did not bother much with the admiring gazes from the crowd. He only chuckled. Merely, his chuckle was brimming with pride.

At the moment when the crowd was praising Grandmaster Prophet for how amazing he was, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had already managed to pass through the sea of flames. They had reached a vast space.

It was a grand hall constructed with blue crystals.

The construction style of that grand hall could truly be described with the term ‘superlative craftsmanship.’ Even though Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were all Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, it would still be impossible for them to construct such an exquisite and imposing palace. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

However, compared to how imposing and grand that palace hall was, the gazes of the three of them were all captivated by a figure before them.

That person was an old man. He wore a blue gown, and had his hands behind his back.

Although he was old, he possessed jade-like skin, and there was not the slightest trace of a wrinkle on his face. Merely, his head of white hair and his face full of white beard betrayed his status as an elderly individual.

At that moment, the old man had a smile on his face as he looked at Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

Although the old man had an amiable appearance, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were all extremely nervous.

The same thought came to the minds of Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

That was, they felt that the person before them might be Grandmaster Kai Hong.

Merely, what appeared before them was not a coffin, nor was it a corpse. Rather, it was a vivid and life-like old man who gave off a threatening aura.

Could it be that the legendary Grandmaster Kai Hong was still alive?
