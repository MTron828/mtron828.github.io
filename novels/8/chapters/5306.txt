Chapter 5306: The Prodigies of Two Generations

“What’s that? Was it just my imagination?” Jia Chengxiong murmured with a frown.

He couldn’t confirm what it was, but it planted a seed of unease in his heart. He chose not to think too much into it and advance on lest Chu Feng catch up with him.

“AH!”

Jia Chengxiong suddenly shrieked. Someone had appeared before him at some point in time. Upon closer look, it was Chu Feng!

“H-how did you get here?” Jia Chengxiong was baffled.

“Why can’t I be here?” Chu Feng asked.

“Damn it! You must have cheated! I won’t let you win just like that!” 

Jia Chengxiong executed his movement skill and charged forward as fast as he could, but to his bewilderment, Chu Feng could easily match his pace while running backward.  

“You… How is this possible?!” 

Jia Chengxiong couldn’t believe what was happening. He couldn’t sense any martial power from Chu Feng at all. He couldn’t understand how Chu Feng could move at such a terrifying speed without exerting any martial power.

“You still don’t get it, dimwit? Allow me to enlighten you.”

Chu Feng raised his palm and released a surge of spirit power.

“You!!! You’re a God-cloak World Spiritist!”

Jia Chengxiong was horrified. He would have never imagined that Chu Feng would be a God-cloak World Spiritist on top of being a Martial Exalted level cultivator. Despite having won the title of the strongest late Martial Exalted cultivator, his spirit power was actually stronger than his cultivation!

“You could have entered the Ancient Realm if you were a bit humbler. I might have chosen not to compete with you. You aren’t a kid anymore. You should know better than to recklessly provoke others, especially when you don’t know what your opponent is capable of,” Chu Feng snorted.

He patted Jia Chengxiong’s shoulder before turning around and dashing ahead. It took only a blink of an eye for him to disappear from sight.

“Damn it!”

Knowing that he didn’t stand a chance against Chu Feng, Jia Chengxiong’s footsteps screeched to a halt. It was clear that he wouldn’t be able to enter the Ancient Realm anymore. 

But the more he thought about it, the more infuriated he felt. He bellowed after Chu Feng, “Don’t you get gleeful. You might have defeated me, but there’s no way you would be a match for my big brother! Even if you manage to enter the Ancient Realm, the only fate awaiting you is death!”

The lack of response from Chu Feng only maddened him more. It made his threat feel empty.

“Chu Feng, I’ll personally slaughter you once you’re out of the Ancient Realm!” Jia Chengxiong spat through clenched jaws. 

Chu Feng didn’t hear Jia Chengxiong’s threats at all. His spirit power was comparable to a Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist despite being only at White Dragon God-cloak himself. It didn’t take him long to arrive at the end of the passageway, where a spirit formation gate awaited him.

He knew that he could enter the Ancient Realm once he entered the spirit formation gate, but he didn’t proceed right away. Instead, he sat down and closed his eyes. 

From the moment he entered this passageway, he could already sense the presence of martial enlightenment. His intuition was on the mark. There was indeed martial enlightenment in here. That was also why he didn’t chase after Jia Chengxiong right away at the start.

However, he quickly realized that the deeper he advanced into the passageway, the more concentrated the martial enlightenment was. Thus, he hurriedly chased after Jia Chengxiong and rushed to the endpoint. 

Just as he had expected, the martial enlightenment here was much more concentrated. It wasn’t anything too impressive, but he didn’t want to miss any opportunity to raise his cultivation. 

… 

While Chu Feng was busy grasping the martial enlightenment, a few people had already passed through the spirit formation gate to enter the Ancient Realm. 

As if having sensed their presence, the elder from the Ancient Realm, who had been standing outside all this while, turned to the crowd and said, “I apologize, but I’ll have to take my leave first.”

Teleportation energy gathered around the elder, and he vanished into thin air.

Despite the departure of the elder from the Ancient Realm, the spectators didn’t scatter right away. With much greater rewards on the line, everyone was curious to know who would clear the final test and acquire the Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads.

From time to time, some people in the crowd would look at the sky, but they dared not allow their gazes to linger. They were afraid that their gazes might incur the displeasure of the powerhouses in the sky. 

Hidden in the golden light were several hundred white immortal cranes. These immortal cranes had wings that boasted a span of over ten thousand meters. They carried resplendent palaces that bore the flags of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect on their backs. 

Interestingly, the grandest palace was not carried by any of these immortal cranes. Instead, it was on a floating mountain pulled by ten immortal cranes. In this palace sat a golden-haired elder who gave off an air of sageliness. He was levitating off the floor in a sitting position. 

He was in the midst of cultivation. From time to time, he would emanate a ripple of martial power that was far beyond what the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s Mo Wuxiang could deal with. 

Mo Wuxiang wouldn’t have even dared to cross blows with Xia Xingchen had he known that this elder was here. After all, this elder was one of the Ten Immortal Exalted of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, Gongsun Wentian. 

The Ten Immortal Exalted were powerful cultivators who were only second to the sectmaster in the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. 

Xia Xingchen, who had previously crossed blows with Mo Wuxiang, was inside the palace too. She was looking out of the window to gaze into the grayish-black aura, where those from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace dwelled. Her eyes were glowing with a peculiar light, an effect arising from her detection means, but despite so, she was unable to see beyond the grayish-black aura. 

“They constructed a barrier. God knows what they are up to. I really want to head over to take a look,” Xia Xingchen murmured.

Even though Gongsun Wentian was cultivating with his eyes closed, he still took the effort to warn her, “Xingchen, don’t get involved in their affairs.”  VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Lord Wentian, why didn’t you help me eradicate those demons earlier on?” Xia Xingchen grumbled.

“Don’t underestimate the Bluemoon Sacred Palace. They have brought many experts with them. I don’t have any confidence in defeating them,” Gongsun Wentian replied. 

Xia Xingchen widened her eyes in astonishment. “Really? Did the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master come here too?”

Instead of answering the question, Gongsun Wentian reiterated what he had said earlier, “Don’t underestimate the Bluemoon Sacred Palace.” 

“But good and evil cannot coexist. How can we allow them to exist alongside our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect?” Xia Xingchen exclaimed.

“Indeed, good and evil cannot coexist, but there’s no grudge between us and the Bluemoon Sacred Palace. You should also know that God’s Era has already begun. We should avoid making more enemies, especially neutral powers like theirs,” Gongsun Wentian said. 

“All right.” Xia Xingchen shrugged. 

She turned her attention toward the wooden gate below, where numerous cultivators could be seen leaving the premises. Those were the people who had either given up on or failed the test. 

“That white-haired girl who entered the red gate earlier is pretty formidable. I wonder if Qin Shu will be able to defeat her. No, that’s not important. The important thing is for Qin Shu not to lose to those brats from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect!” Xia Xingchen said.

“Instead of that white-haired girl, that lad named Chu Feng will pose more of a threat,” Gongsun Wentian said.

“Are you referring to that fellow who snuck toward the red gate under concealment? I heard that he’s the champion of some Trial of the Strongest Martial Exalted thing,” Xia Xingchen said.

“Yes, I’m talking about him.” 

“Is he very strong?” 

“His cultivation doesn’t seem to be very impressive, but did you notice the absence of fear on his face when he walked out of the red gate earlier on?” Gongsun Wentian asked.

Xia Xingchen fell into deep thought. Moments later, her eyes lit up in realization. “Are you saying that he could have cleared the second test, but he relinquished his victory to the white-haired woman?”

“That’s what I’m guessing,” Gongsun Wentian replied.

Even though Chu Feng had been hiding before his concealment was dispelled by the red gate, his interaction with the white-haired woman didn’t escape Gongsun Wentian and Xia Xingchen’s notice. They were aware that the two of them were acquainted. 

“Now that you have put it that way, that lad is indeed an interesting one. Chu Feng, is it? I guess the Totem Galaxy does have some prodigies, after all.” Xia Xingchen chuckled.

She rested her beautiful face on her arm and gazed out of the window with a regretful look on her face. “Things sure have gotten interesting here. It’s a pity that Qin Xuan has left for the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, or else he would have been unrivaled amongst the juniors here. That would have been a huge boost of morale for our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.”

All of a sudden, Xia Xingchen recalled something else and turned to Gongsun Wentian. “Lord Wentian, do you think that our Qin Xuan will be able to become the strongest junior of the Nine Galaxies? If he succeeds, would that mean that God’s Era has begun because of him?”

Gongsun Wentian stopped his cultivation and slowly opened his eyes.

“It’s not that easy. None of the juniors in the current generation are pushovers, be it the Totem Dragon Clan, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, or the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion. The juniors of the current generation are much stronger than those in your generation,” Gongsun Wentian said. 

“That’s hard to say.” Xia Xingchen pouted.

“Unwilling to concede on that? But you weren’t anywhere close to their cultivation back when you were at their age,” Gongsun Wentian pointed out with a smile. 

“That’s not it. I concede that the juniors in the current generation are, on average, much stronger, but you shouldn’t forget that our generation had Jie Ranqing,” Xia Xingchen replied.

Gongsun Wentian’s eyes narrowed upon hearing that name.
