Chapter 2850 - Chu Feng Arriving On Stage

“Humph, why didn’t you say those words when senior brother Song was here?”

Seeing that someone actually spoke ill of Song Yunfei, the Starfall Holy Land’s disciples immediately started to question that individual in a very displeased manner.

“Why does that matter? He’s planning to kill us anyways. You all should’ve felt the killing intent earlier. That was simply not the Soul-devouring Beast’s killing intent. Rather, it was Song Yunfei’s killing intent. If it wasn’t for the sudden appearance of the Soul-devouring Beast, we would’ve died by Song Yunfei’s hands already,” That man replied angrily.

“You...!”

Even though the Starfall Holy Land’s disciples were feeling very displeased, they were unable to refute that man.

After all, they too had felt the killing intent emitted by Song Yunfei. Song Yunfei was planning to kill them. Thus, this was the truth, and not something that they could refute.

“What liveliness. Never would I have imagined that everyone would be here.”

Right at that moment, a voice was heard. Turning toward the direction of the voice, the crowd discovered that Chu Feng was leisurely walking toward them.

“Brother Chu Feng, what sort of Bestowment Talisman did you obtain?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, some people immediately walked toward him cordially.

“I’ve obtained three Bestowment Talismans,” Chu Feng answered.

“Three? That many? Amazing!” The crowd that had surrounded Chu Feng began to utter praises.

“So what if it’s three? Not to mention three, even thirty Bestowment Talismans would be useless. You all saw the strength revealed by senior brother Song earlier. He was even capable of fighting against the Soul-devouring Beast. The outcome of this game has been decided. We are all going to lose. The one to win will be senior brother Song,” The Starfall Holy Land’s disciples spoke in an extremely proud manner.

It was as if the one fighting the Soul-devouring Beast earlier wasn’t Song Yunfei, but rather their ancestor. They were so very proud of what Song Yunfei had accomplished.

“The sound of fighting earlier was caused by Song Yunfei and the Soul-devouring Beast?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. Song Yunfei obtained a special Bestowment Talisman. His strength is comparable to that of a Martial Ancestor-level martial cultivator. He is simply too powerful,” The people around Chu Feng said.

“Since you’ve heard the sounds of the battle, you should have an idea of what’s going on. There’s no need to struggle anymore, just sit tight and wait for death. Senior brother Song will come and take care of you all,” The Starfall Holy Land’s disciples said.

“That’s not for certain. I can go and search for that Bestowment Talisman now. If I am to find it, I would be able to contend against Song Yunfei,” Someone said.

“Forget about it. Judging by Song Yunfei’s character, he must’ve searched all of the cliff summits before coming here. It’s impossible for him to have left any Bestowment Talismans for us,” At that moment, Jian Wuqiang, who had always been quiet, actually spoke out against it.

“This...?”

After hearing what Jian Wuqing said, many people that thought about searching for Bestowment Talismans immediately gave up on that thought. They became extremely depressed.

Jian Wuqing was someone who had known and fought against Song Yunfei. Thus, he knew the way Song Yunfei did things.

Furthermore, the crowd firmly believed in Jian Wuqing’s character. While Jian Wuqing was someone who spoke very little, he was a very upright person. It was impossible for him to say this sort of thing just to deceive them.

However, there were still people that refused to believe this. Those people began to run toward the mountain peaks. They wanted to search for the Bestowment Talisman that Song Yunfei had obtained.

“Actually, I wanted to ask who the victor was in the fight between Song Yunfei and the Soul-devouring Beast,” Chu Feng asked curiously.

“That Soul-devouring Beast was too powerful. Song Yunfei was simply no match for it. However, it remains that he was able to fight against the Soul-devouring Beast momentarily. That by itself is already an extremely amazing feat,” Someone said.

“If that’s the case, I am at ease,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?”

The Starfall Holy Land’s disciples asked in a very displeased manner. They felt there was some sort of hidden meaning behind Chu Feng’s words.

“It’s nothing. I merely wanted to fight against the Soul-devouring Beast,” Chu Feng said.

“You wish to fight against the Soul-devouring Beast? Haha, I suggest you not seek to humiliate yourself.”

Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Starfall Holy Land’s disciples immediately started laughing. They were laughing as if they have heard something extremely funny, laughing so very joyfully.

“Is it funny?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s naturally funny.”

“Chu Feng, do you think that you’re completely unequalled after obtaining the power of the Bestowment Talismans?”

“I might as well tell you this. Everyone here has obtained the power of a Bestowment Talisman.”

“Judging from the way you look, you have, at the very most, obtained the power of the Rank Three Strength Bestowment Talisman. You are but a dime a dozen among the people here.”

“As for our senior brother Song, even his body has been transformed. He is emitting golden light all over. It is extremely domineering.”

“Not only was he capable of easily slicing through a mountain, leaving behind an enormous crack over a thousand meters in length, but he was also able to fly.”

“In an illusory world like this, he is simply akin to a god that we can only look up to.”

“Yet, even with how powerful senior brother Song was, he was still beaten away by the Soul-devouring Beast. As for you, you are simply out of question.”

“Likely, a single fart from that Soul-devouring Beast would be able to completely crush your body, shattering your bones. You would not even be able to approach the Soul-devouring Beast,” The Starfall Holy Land’s disciples said in a very mocking manner.

They felt that it was simply nonsense for Chu Feng to challenge the Soul-devouring Beast.

As for Chu Feng, he completely brushed off their mockery.

Regardless of whether or not they were geniuses, they were still merely a bunch of mediocre individuals in Chu Feng’s eyes. Chu Feng did not even have the inclination to bother explaining himself to a bunch of people like them.

Thus, Chu Feng quietly chanted the spell that could summon the Soul-devouring Beast.

“Rumble~~~”

Right after Chu Feng finished chanting the spell, lightning and black clouds immediately covered the sky.

“Heavens! What is happening?! Could it be that the Soul-devouring Beast is coming again?!”

“Could it be that senior brother Song has been killed, and it’s returning to kill us now?”

The crowd were all alarmed upon seeing the black clouds. They had not managed to hear Chu Feng chanting the spell. Thus, they had no idea that the Soul-devouring Beast had returned because of Chu Feng’s spell. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that the situation was bad, the crowd immediately started fleeing in all directions. Only Chu Feng did not flee.

Not only was Chu Feng not fleeing, but he even started walking toward the location where the Soul-devouring Beast would descend.
