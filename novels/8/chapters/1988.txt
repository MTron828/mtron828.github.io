Chapter 1988 - Stellar Key

Chu Feng sped forth. Enroute, he heard many explosions. Later on... he finally saw the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, as well as that Elf Protector.

However, at the same time, he also saw Luan Jie. Luan Jie was currently fighting against the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector. Furthermore, this time around, Luan Jie was serious. He had become exceptionally fierce. To a greater or lesser degree, both the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector were injured by Luan Jie. If this were to continue, the two of them would undoubtedly be defeated by Luan Jie.

However, at that moment, Chu Feng’s gaze was fixed onto the sky above the location where the three men were fighting. There was an enormous silhouette in the sky. She had a snow white skirt and long fluttering hair. Her appearance was exactly the same as the Moon Immortal that Chu Feng had seen.

Merely, her face was exceptionally sinister, and her eyes were emitting a crimson, murderous shine. It was as if she wanted to kill all the living things in the world. In fact, the killing intent that she emitted was many times more frightening than that of the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.

Most importantly, her aura was extremely frightening. She was an existence even more powerful than the Elf King.

That frightening silhouette covered that entire region of the sky. It was a truly frightening sight.

Moon Demon. That was most likely that so-called evil thoughts, that Moon Demon.

Merely, that Moon Demon was trapped in the sky. Even though she was struggling violently, she was unable to break free.

It turned out that seven keys had trapped the Moon Demon in the sky. Upon seeing those seven keys, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

Those seven keys were like the starry sky. They were extremely special. They were the Stellar Keys.

Chu Feng also possessed one such Stellar Key. He had obtained it from the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King’s inheritance.

Originally, Chu Feng had been curious the entire time as to what use that Stellar Key possessed. And now, he finally realized what its use was.

“Chu Feng, get away from here! Those Stellar Keys are actually capable of controlling the Moon Demon! If this is to continue, the Stellar Keys will end up completely controlling the Moon Demon!”

“Quickly, get away from the Moonlight Maze! Have everyone else escape from the Moonlight Maze too!” Upon seeing Chu Feng’s arrival, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector began to shout at Chu Feng.

“Hahaha, you won’t be able to escape. All of you will die. Even if you manage to escape today, you will not be able to escape tomorrow,” Luan Jie laughed loud and sinisterly.

“That’s not for certain,” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out his deep blue treasured bow and aimed it at Luan Jie.

“What are you trying to do? You couldn’t possibly be thinking about shooting me with that bow, right?!”

“You damned fool. Even if you used that Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader, you would still not be a match for me. Yet you actually want to shoot me dead with an Incomplete Imperial Armament? Chu Feng, have you gone retarded or what? Hahahaha!” Upon seeing Chu Feng’s deep blue bow, Luan Jie laughed even more wildly. His laughter was filled with mockery.

He truly found Chu Feng to be ridiculous. Especially after he saw how confident Chu Feng was, as if he could really shoot him dead, Luan Jie was unable to contain himself from wanting to ridicule Chu Feng.

“That, could it be?!!!”

However, upon seeing the deep blue bow that Chu Feng took out, both the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the Elf Protector’s expression changed. They seemed to have thought of something. Immediately, the two of them revealed joyous expressions.

The very next moment, Chu Feng’s right hand streaked across his Cosmos Sack. Then, the Qilin Arrow appeared in his hand. He placed the arrow onto the deep blue bow and pulled the bowstring fully back.

“That... that arrow?” Upon seeing the Qilin Arrow in Chu Feng’s hand, Luan Jie was startled. Fear emerged in his previously complacent face. Evidently, he realized that that Qilin Arrow was a remarkable item.

The very next moment, Chu Feng shouted, “Rank seven Martial Emperor, Luan Jie, die!!!!”

“Whoosh~~~”

Once Chu Feng shouted those words, the Qilin Arrow shot forth from the bow. As golden light streaked across the sky, it instantly arrived before Luan Jie.

Everything happened too quickly. “Boom!” That Qilin Arrow pierced Luan Jie and completely shattered his body.

“That arrow is actually that powerful?”

After personally seeing Chu Feng shoot Luan Jie to death with a single arrow, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the Elf Protector were feeling both fear and joy.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, Chu Feng leapt forth. He waved his sleeve at the empty space before him. Then, a layer of boundless world spirit power turned into an enormous net and enveloped over half the sky.

“Condense!” Chu Feng shouted. Then, that enormous net began to condense in size. After condensing, the net formed a silhouette in the space before him that was originally without a single soul.

“Still not revealing yourself?” Chu Feng looked to the humanoid-shaped silhouette and sneered.

“Chu Feng, if you dare to kill me, my father will definitely not let you get away with it,” Right after Chu Feng spoke, Luan Jie’s voice was actually heard. Soon, Luan Jie appeared in the net. Merely, the current Luan Jie already no longer had an actual corporeal body. Instead, he had turned into an awareness. In other words, he was in his spirit form.

Furthermore, his cultivation was greatly inferior to before. He was no longer a rank seven Martial Emperor, and had become a rank five Martial Emperor. With such a cultivation, he would naturally not be a match for Chu Feng.

The reason why his cultivation had decreased this much after he turned into a spirit was actually also because of that Qilin Arrow. The fact that he had managed to escape in spirit form before the Qilin Arrow hit him was already very remarkable.

Unfortunately, his plan to escape in spirit form was unable to bypass Chu Feng’s eyes. In the end, he was captured by Chu Feng.

“My ass!” Seeing how Luan Jie actually dared to threaten him in such a state, Chu Feng raised his leg and ruthlessly and repeatedly kicked Luan Jie, who was contained in the net.

“Stop, stop,” Luan Jie was currently in spirit form. Thus, he was unable to vomit any blood. However, to be kicked repeatedly by Chu Feng caused him to vomit out green gaseous substances nonstop. His state was truly miserable.

“Remember, even if I don’t kill you, your father will not have planned to spare me anyways. Thus, do not use your bastard father to threaten me. I am not someone who’s afraid of threats,” Chu Feng pointed at the shivering Luan Jie who he had just ruthlessly beaten.

“Yes, yes, yes,” While shivering nonstop, Luan Jie nodded his head. At that moment, he no longer possessed any arrogance. He was like a timid little mouse. The reason for that was because he did not wish to die, as Chu Feng was someone who dared to kill him. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Afterward, Chu Feng did not bother with Luan Jie anymore. Instead, he turned his gaze to the Moon Demon. He discovered that while the Moon Demon had been fixed to the sky by those seven Stellar Keys, those seven Stellar Keys would not be able to control the Moon Demon for an extended period of time.

“Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?” The Elf Protector asked.

“I am going to contain the Moon Demon,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, Luan Jie used those seven Stellar Keys to capture the Moon Demon. Likely, he was planning to use those seven Stellar Keys to contain the Moon Demon.”

“However, even after all this time has passed, the Moon Demon’s strength had not weakened in the slightest. Furthermore, it does not seem to have the intention to obey those seven Stellar Keys.”

“The way I see it, those seven Stellar Keys are simply unable to subdue that Moon Demon. How about we think of a way to eliminate the Moon Demon’s resentment? We should use the Fire and Ice Pearls in Lil’ Rou and Lil’ Mei’s bodies to turn the Moon Demon into the Moon Immortal,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said. As for that... it had been their plan from the very beginning.

“No, I have another method,” Chu Feng said.

As matters stood, Chu Feng no longer planned to remove the Fire and Ice Pearls from Su Rou and Su Mei’s bodies. He had an even better plan.

“Hehe...” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Luan Jie laughed mockingly. He had laughed very secretly, and actually did not emit any sound of laughter.

However, his laughter was still heard by Chu Feng. Thus, Chu Feng turned to him and asked, “What are you laughing about?”

“I didn’t laugh,” Luan Jie shook his head repeatedly.

“Thump~~~”

Chu Feng raised his leg and kicked Luan Jie in the face, causing him to grimace in pain. Even though he was currently a spirit, Luan Jie was still able to feel pain.

After that kick, Chu Feng asked again, “Did you laugh or not?”

“I laughed, I laughed,” Luan Jie nodded his head repeatedly.

“What are you laughing about? Are you laughing at how I’m unable to control that Moon Demon?” Chu Feng asked.

“No, no,” Luan Jie shook his head repeatedly.

“Thump~~~”

Chu Feng raised his leg and unleashed another kick. Once again, the kick landed on Luan Jie’s face. Then, he asked, “Is it?”

“Yes, yes, yes,” Luan Jie nodded repeatedly. However, immediately afterward, he shook his head repeatedly. He said, “What the Weaponry Refinement Immortal said is actually very correct. Those seven Stellar Keys have been unable to weaken that Moon Demon’s strength even after so long. This means that it is impossible to contain her with only those seven Stellar Keys. You will not be able to subdue that Moon Demon, much less control her.”

“Oh? What if I use this?” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out an item.

“That... how could that be?!!!” Upon seeing the item in Chu Feng’s hand, Luan Jie was struck dumb. Even the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Elf Protector, Su Rou and Su Mei were also stunned.

The reason for that was because, according to the legends, there were only seven Stellar Keys. Three were scattered throughout the Holy Land of Martialism, and the Four Great Imperial Clans each possessed one for a total of seven.

It was already a very miraculous feat for the Dark Hall to be able to gather all seven Stellar Keys.

Yet now... Chu Feng actually took out an eighth Stellar Key.
