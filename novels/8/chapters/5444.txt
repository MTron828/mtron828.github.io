Chapter 5444: Anyone Who Dares Enter Won’t Be Leaving Here

Each realm in the Gate of the Masses had its own time restriction. The more difficult the realm was, the more time one would be granted inside the realm.

Most people who had entered the Gate of the Masses had already left its premises by now, but the fact that it was still operating showed that someone was still inside. The crowd couldn’t help but notice that one particular famous individual who had entered the Gate of the Masses earlier wasn’t out yet.

Furthermore, the scenery depicted on the Gate of the Masses had begun changing. The original painting had shattered into pieces, revealing a sight reminiscent of the world’s beginning. It was both majestic and stunning.

“Lord Painter, does this scenery mean that someone has triggered the Gate of the Masses’ Infernal Realm?”

Quite a few people turned their sights to the World Spiritist Painter, hoping to receive an answer from him.

Those who laid their hands on the fortuitous encounter in one of the more formidable realms would be granted a choice of whether to accept their current fortuitous encounter or challenge a harder realm. If they choose the latter and clear the harder realm, they would be transported into the Infernal Realm.

What was special about the Infernal Realm was that the happenings inside would be shown to those outside via the Gate of the Masses.

Two thousand years had passed since the Infernal Realm last appeared. The one who activated the Infernal Realm was Long Chengzi, a top-notch prodigy from the Totem Dragon Clan who was publicly acknowledged to be the strongest prodigy in the vast world of cultivation in his era.

Long Chengzhi was now two thousand years old. While it was impressive by the standards of mortals, he was still nothing more than a fledgling compared to those who had cultivated for tens of thousands of years. Yet, he had already become one of the reserve candidates for the Totem Dragon Clan’s Nine Flags Dragon Warriors in view of his incredible strength.

The Gate of the Masses had opened many times since then, but no one after Long Chengzhi had managed to trigger the Infernal Realm.

If Chu Feng was really the one who had opened the Infernal Realm today, his reputation would surely soar by leaps and bounds. That feat meant that he was a prodigy who was at least on par with Long Chengzhi!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The Infernal Realm is indeed about to open, and things are slightly different from the last time,” the World Spiritist Painter said.

“Different? How so?” The crowd was bewildered.

“The rest of you will be able to enter the Infernal Realm this time around,” the World Spiritist Painter replied.

“We can enter the Infernal Realm too?”

The crowd was excited to learn that they could participate in the Infernal Realm too and compete for its fortuitous encounter.

“Lord Painter, could this be a more formidable Infernal Realm than the one triggered by Long Chengzhi?” someone asked out of curiosity.

“It is,” the World Spiritist Painter replied with a nod.

“My gosh! Chu Feng sure is a terrifying junior!”

The crowd was astonished.

On the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s warship, Jia Lingyi gazed at the Gate of the Masses with an awful expression. She turned around and looked at the woman sitting behind her.

It was the same woman whom Chu Feng had encountered inside the Gate of the Masses.

There were no visible injuries on the woman, but her complexion looked awful as if she had suffered some kind of backlash. It was to the extent that some of the elders of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had to step in to aid in her recovery.

“Are you really no match for Chu Feng?” Jia Lingyi asked.

“Is there a reason for me to lie?” the woman snapped.

Unlike the others from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, she harbored no respect or fear toward Jia Lingyi at all.

“When are you going to make your second move?” Jia Lingyi asked.

“I just need a bit more time to condition myself,” the woman replied.

Hu hu hu!

Furious gales suddenly whipped up outside as a vortex formed around the Gate of the Masses. Slowly, a realm showed in the painting. It didn’t take long for the crowd to spot Chu Feng in it.

Inside the realm, Chu Feng raised his head to look at the sky. He could see a gigantic spirit formation gate there, and through it, he was able to see and hear what was happening outside. He looked at the different scenery around him, followed by the spirit formation gate floating in the sky, then his clenched right fist. It didn’t take him long to figure out what was going on.

“Hey, can anyone outside hear me?” Chu Feng shouted.

“We can hear you!” There were plenty of replies from those outside.

“Elder Painter, are others allowed to enter this realm too?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young friend Chu Feng, this is the realm you have triggered. As long as you permit it, they’ll be allowed to enter that realm,” the World Spiritist Painter replied.

“Is it this?” Chu Feng opened up his right palm and revealed a formation.

“Yes, that’s the control formation,” the World Spiritist Painter replied.

Chu Feng formed a series of hand seals before pointing his finger at the sky. The formation in his right palm transformed into a flow of light that shot toward the gigantic spirit formation gate. The two fused together, and the spirit formation gate finally opened.

However, there was a restriction placed on the spirit formation gate.

“Only juniors are allowed to enter?”

Some of the older cultivators hung their heads in disappointment. They had wanted to enter the Infernal Realm to take a look, but they were unable to do so due to the restriction Chu Feng had placed on the spirit formation gate.

Most people didn’t voice their complaints as they thought that Chu Feng had the right to decide the access right since he was the one who had opened the Infernal Realm, but unfortunately, not everyone understood that logic, especially those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

“Chu Feng, why did you set the restriction? Are you afraid that we’ll march in and slaughter you?”

“Hah, isn’t that obvious?”

“You invited us here, but you turn out to be a coward. Pathetic!”

Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect sneered.

“You must have gotten your heads kicked by donkeys to utter such brainless words. You should be glad that I’m even opening the gate at all,” Chu Feng scoffed.

“The resources inside the Infernal Realm are limited. The more people who enter the realm, the fewer resources to go around. Young friend Chu Feng was the one who acquired this fortuitous encounter, so he has the right to decide who he wants to share these resources with. I wouldn’t have been as generous as him,” the World Spiritist Painter said.

Those words left many feeling a tinge of respect for Chu Feng, especially the juniors. He could have chosen not to share anything with them, but he still opened it up to the other juniors. If they were in the same position as him, they would have probably chosen to monopolize everything by themselves.

“World Spiritist Painter, who doesn’t know that you’re in cahoots with Chu Feng? Do you really take us for fools? It’s obvious that Chu Feng set that restriction because he was afraid that we’d enter the Infernal Realm and deal with him.”

“Just think about it! Who would be so kind as to share their resources? Who knows? Maybe he needs to open the gate, or else he wouldn’t be able to obtain any resources at all?”

Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect refused to accept the World Spiritist Painter’s words and continued to spew lies.

“Your Pill Dao Immortal Sect has brought many of your juniors here, including your strongest junior Jia Chengying, right? You can send them in if you truly wish to teach young friend Chu Feng a lesson,” the World Spiritist Painter said.

Before those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect could reply, Chu Feng interjected, “Elder Painter, they dare not to do so. They know that they’ll only be sending their juniors to their deaths.”

“Nonsense! Who gave you the courage to spout such preposterous words? You have only won the title of the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator. How can you compare with the prodigies of our Pill Dao Immortal Sect?”

Many from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect roared in indignation.

Few people in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect knew about Chu Feng’s history with Jia Chengying, let alone outsiders. Those words left the crowd wondering if Chu Feng was really confident that he could deal with even Jia Chengying.

Faced with the crowd’s doubtful gazes, Chu Feng chuckled under his breath and said, “Stop barking, dogs of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. I’ll put these words out here right now. I’ll allow all juniors except for those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect to enter the Infernal Realm. Any junior from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect who dares to sneak in here will be killed without any exception!”
