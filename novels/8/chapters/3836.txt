Chapter 3836 - Absurd Marriage

“Young Master Meng, what has brought you such joy?” asked Chu Feng.

“It’s nothing special. I’ve actually come here today to bid farewell to young master Asura,” said Meng Rufei.

“You’re leaving?” asked Chu Feng.

“Mn, if everything goes smoothly, I will be leaving tomorrow.”

“Although I’ve known young master Asura for only a short period of time, and we’ve had our disagreements in the past, it could be said that our disagreements have led to friendship.”

“Because of that, I wanted to come and inform young master Asura of one matter before leaving, so as to prevent young master from feeling sad in the future.”

Meng Rufei said those words in a very mystifying manner.

Since Chu Feng knew that Meng Rufei had come with ill intentions, he also wanted to know what exactly that Meng Rufei wanted. Thus, he asked, “What is it?”

“If I’m not mistaken, young master Asura must be fond of Miss Yin, right?” asked Meng Rufei.

“What makes you think that?” asked Chu Feng.

“Intuition,” said Meng Rufei.

“In that case, what sort of fondness is the fondness that you speak of?” asked Chu Feng.

“It would naturally be the one between a man and a woman," said Meng Rufei.

“Miss Yin and I possess a friendship. However, if it’s fondness we’re talking about, it would only be that between friends. I’m afraid that it is different from what young master Meng is thinking.”

“It would appear that young master Meng’s intuition is not quite accurate," said Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, the corners of Meng Rufei’s mouth rose into a mocking smile. He said, “You know deep in your heart as to whether or not you’re fond of Miss Yin. Young master Asura, don’t blame me for being unbefitting of a friend, for I have reminded you today that it’ll be impossible for you and Miss Yin. It is best that you give up on her so as to avoid being injured.”

“Furthermore, as the saying goes, only a hero is befitting of a beauty. There is naturally a reason why Miss Yin did not choose you. Thus, young master Asura, you should reflect upon yourself and see if you’re lacking somewhere.”

“Of course, I do not hold any malice. I am totally advising you out of goodwill.”

Meng Rufei looked at Chu Feng with a beaming smile. Although he said that he was advising Chu Feng out of goodwill, his facial appearance was fully that of someone taunting Chu Feng.

“If that’s truly the case, then I would also like to give young master Meng a word of advice,” said Chu Feng.

“Advise me?” Meng Rufei revealed a puzzled look. He asked, “What do you want to advise me?”

“If I’m not mistaken, young master Meng must possess deep feelings for Miss Yin.”

“However, if even I am unable to enter Miss Yin’s eyes, it would be best for young master Meng to relinquish the thought of Miss Yin as soon as possible. After all, I am superior to young master Meng in every aspect.”

“Of course, I am merely advising young master Meng out of goodwill. I do not hold any malice at all," Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, Meng Rufei’s smile immediately disappeared, and was replaced with gloom.

He seemed to want to refute Chu Feng. However, he discovered that he was unable to do so. After all, Chu Feng was not boasting. Regardless of whether it might be his cultivation or his world spirit techniques, he was indeed inferior to Chu Feng.

“Humph. Young master Asura, I’ve already said all that I needed to tell you, you’re on your own now.”

Seeing that he was unable to win against Chu Feng in an argument, Meng Rufei waved his sleeve and left without a second thought.

After Meng Rufei left, Chu Feng returned to his residence.

Chu Feng had already realized that something was wrong from the way Lil Xin was talking to him earlier.

And now, Meng Rufei had deliberately come to ridicule him. This made him realize that something was most definitely wrong.

Chu Feng felt that this matter was most definitely related to Yin Zhuanghong.

“Lil Xin, did something happen? Tell me directly.” Chu Feng said to Lil Xin. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“This...” Lil Xin was hesitant.

“It must be because of this matter that you came to seek me out today. Since you’re already here, why are you still hesitating?” asked Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Lil Xin gritted her teeth and revealed what had happened to Chu Feng.

The matter started with the reason why the Red-dress Holy Land had invited Zhang Duotuo as a guest.

The Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster made a gamble against another starfield’s world spiritist.

Naturally, the gamble was over one’s world spirit techniques.

For the sake of obtaining victory, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster immediately requested help from Zhang Duotuo.

That said, the person the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster really wanted to invite over was Grandmaster Yuan Shu.

That was also the reason why Yin Zhuanghong sought to see Grandmaster Yuan Shu.

As for Zhang Duotuo, he seemed to know that he was only a backup, whereas Grandmaster Yuan Shu was the person the Red-dress Holy Land had truly wanted to invite.

Thus, after he learned that the Red-dress Holy Land had failed to invite Grandmaster Yuan Shu, he made an excessive demand.

He demanded that for him to continue to assist the Red-dress Holy Land, Yin Zhuanghong must be married to his disciple, Meng Rufei.

“Preposterous! Are you to tell me that your headmaster agreed to such an excessive demand?!” Chu Feng asked with a look of anger on his face.

As matters stood, he was practically certain that the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster had agreed to the demand. Otherwise, Lil Xin would not be so nervous, and Meng Rufei would not be so pleased with himself.

“Lady Headmaster indeed agreed to it.”

“However, that’s because she had no other alternative. After all, today is the day of the gamble.”

“Her opponent’s world spiritist has already arrived. As for Zhang Duotuo, he made the demand this morning.”

“At such a time, it is impossible for Lady Headmaster to find other world spiritists to help her. Thus, she had no choice but to agree to the demand," said Lil Xin.

“No choice? It is nothing more than a gamble, yet she’s planning to marry off her disciple to someone she doesn’t love?!”

Chu Feng felt extremely furious. After all, this matter was completely absurd to begin with.

No matter what, one shouldn’t use the happiness of another as a gambling stake.

Besides, that was the gamble of the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster. Why did Yin Zhuanghong have to be involved?

“This gamble seems to be very important. Otherwise, Lady Headmaster would not have behaved in such a manner. Actually, Lady Headmaster loves Lady Holy Daughter dearly,” said Lil Xin.

“Love? This is what it means to love someone dearly? Ridiculous!” A sneer appeared on Chu Feng’s face.

“Where is Yin Zhuanghong? She agreed to it?” asked Chu Feng.

“Lady Holy Daughter has been raised by Lady Headmaster her entire life. She will never go against Lady Headmaster’s words. Thus, she naturally agreed to it. That said, anyone can tell that she is actually unwilling.”

“That is why I came to find you. I feel that Lady Holy Daughter has different feelings for you," said Lil Xin.

“Different?” Chu Feng puckered his brows slightly.

He thought to himself, ‘That girl couldn’t possible like me, right?’

‘But that shouldn’t be the case. After all, I’ve never felt any feelings toward me from that girl.’

‘That said, no matter what, I cannot ignore this matter.’

“Lil Xin, you said that the gamble starts today?” asked Chu Feng.

“It starts officially between the hours of eleven and one today,” said Lil Xin.

“We should still be able to make it.”

“Wait for me here.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he stepped into his bedroom and closed the entrance tightly.

Chu Feng’s action completely puzzled Lil Xin.

Why would Chu Fent enter his bedroom at such a crucial time?

Could he be planning to sleep?

Although she was unable to understand, she still decided to wait for Chu Feng.

As matters stood, she knew that there was no one in the Red-dress Holy Land apart from Chu Feng that could help Yin Zhuanghong.

After all, Yin Zhuanghong would always consider everything their Lady Headmaster said first and foremost. Not even she dared to disobey orders from their Lady Headmaster. With that, how could others possibly do anything?

Although Lil Xin had no idea if Chu Feng could do anything to help Yin Zhuanghong, he was the only option she had.
