Chapter 2926 - Chu Feng Startled

That mocking smile caused Chu Feng to feel displeased in his heart.

While it was true that that Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder was a Martial Immortal-level expert, and one that was extremely close to becoming a peak Martial Immortal...

While it was true that he possessed the strength to sneer at Chu Feng...

That was not the reason why he was sneering at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng held the Evil God Sword in his hand even tighter. He had made a determination in his heart.

If the Goldenstone Royal Clan was to not attempt to provoke him, he would let the matter pass.

However, should they provoke him, he would have them know whether or not he, a person of the younger generation, and the Incomplete Imperial Armament he held in his hand, were as easy to push around as they had imagined them to be.

Meanwhile, the Grand Auction Assembly was still in progress.

The items Chu Feng had handed to the Ghost Sect Hall to auction all generally sold for a decent price. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As for the Swordking City’s Inherited Secret Skill that Chu Feng had seized from Han Yu, it was even being auctioned off as one of the three most precious treasures in the auction.

In the end, the winning bid for that was five million Immortal Martial Stones.

This price had surpassed Chu Feng’s expectation.

After all, that was nothing more than a secret skill.

As for the second of the three most precious treasures in that auction, it was that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.

Once the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram appeared, it immediately brought forth a huge sensation. Many people started to participate in the bidding war. The one million Immortal Martial Stone starting bid reached three million Immortal Martial Stones after several bouts of bidding.

Chu Feng had not bid on it yet. He was waiting for the other bidders to reach the limit of their bids before he started bidding himself. After all, bidding now would not have much impact.

Furthermore, Chu Feng wanted to see exactly what the highest bid the people present were willing to put forth would be. With that, he would be able to determine the true value of that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.

“Ten million Immortal Martial Stones.”

Suddenly, that Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief spoke.

Once he spoke, the entire auction hall went quiet. Regardless of whether it might be the crowd down in the auction hall or the crowd on the summit of the auction hall, they all subconsciously turned their gazes in one direction.

It was the direction where the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief was standing.

“This guy, he has indeed come for the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.”

Chu Feng had already guessed that the Goldenstone Royal Clan must’ve come for the sake of the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.

Furthermore, he felt that the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief was originally not planning to show himself.

He had wanted his son, Jinshi Bo, to participate in the auction on his behalf. The Immortal Martial Stones Jinshi Bo lost to Chu Feng should be the money they were planning to use to bid on the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.

Otherwise, that Utmost Exalted Elder would not have hesitated so much when Jinshi Bo demanded the Cosmos Sack from him.

However, Jinshi Bo was too foolish. He actually ended up losing so many Immortal Martial Stones to Chu Feng.

This was likely the reason why the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief decided to personally step in.

At that moment, the auction hall was still completely quiet. However, the crowd soon started to spiritedly discuss the ten million Immortal Martial Stones bid.

Even though the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was indeed a rare treasure, a bid of ten million Immortal Martial Stones had surpassed the limit for many people.

“Eleven million Immortal Martial Stones,” Right at that moment, Chu Feng spoke.

Once Chu Feng made his bid, the people at the summit of the auction hall all turned to Chu Feng. This included that Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder.

As for the people down below, they burst into a complete uproar.

“Holy fuck! This voice! It’s so familiar!”

“It seems to be the same person who spent a great amount to win that piece of scrap metal and started a bidding war for those exotic flowers!”

“That’s right! That’s his voice! Exactly who is he? He’s actually so wealthy. Could he be a young master from the Chu Heavenly Clan?!”

Hearing such discussions, many of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations revealed expressions of displeasure on their faces.

Only they knew that not even they possessed that many Immortal Martial Stones.

At the moment when Chu Feng’s bid caused a huge commotion, only the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief did not bother to pay attention to Chu Feng. Calmly, he said, “Fifteen million Immortal Martial Stones.”

“Sixteen million Immortal Martial Stones,” Chu Feng added.

“Twenty million Immortal Martial Stones,” The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief bidded again.

“Twenty-one million Immortal Martial Stones,” Chu Feng said.

“This... this is simply too crazy.”

The bidding war had reached twenty-one million Immortal Martial Stones in an instant. The astonishment of it all caused the crowd to go completely quiet.

At that moment, the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief finally turned his gaze to Chu Feng, “Little friend Chu Feng, it would appear that you are determined to go against our Goldenstone Royal Clan?”

At that moment, there was a threat in his eyes.

However, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. Calmly, he replied, “It’s a fair bidding war, how am I going against you?”

“Very well. In that case, I shall see exactly how a mere person of the younger generation like yourself can win against me in a bidding war.”

After the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he once again raised his bid.

“Thirty million Immortal Martial Stones.”

When he spoke his bid again, the crowd were no longer able to remain calm.

Thirty million Immortal Martial Stones?

To many people, ten million Immortal Martial Stones was already a price they could not bear.

And now, someone actually had bid thirty million Immortal Martial Stones? Could that person have gone insane?

Was that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram truly worth thirty million Immortal Martial Stones?

“Thirty-one million Immortal Martial Stones,” Right at that moment, Chu Feng bid again.

“Thirty-five million Immortal Martial Stones,” The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief bid again.

At that moment, not to mention the people in the auction hall, even the people at the summit of the auction hall revealed a change in expression.

In fact, even that Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder was looking at his Clan Chief with a different expression in his eyes.

Thirty-five million Immortal Martial Stones?

That Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was simply not worth that much.

However, that Utmost Exalted Elder did not say anything.

He knew very well that his Clan Chief was not only planning to win the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, but he was also planning to win the bidding war against Chu Feng.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng bidded again, “Forty million Immortal Martial Stones.”

Forty million Immortal Martial Stones was Chu Feng’s current limit.

If the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief continued to bid, Chu Feng would have no choice but to admit defeat.

Although Chu Feng wanted the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, he was still someone who knew propriety.

Forty million Immortal Martial Stones was Chu Feng’s limit. If the price went above that, Chu Feng would have no choice but to give up.

“Humph,” Right at that moment, that Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief let out a cold snort. Then, he turned around and proceeded to walk directly toward the exit.

When he walked by Chu Feng, Chu Feng saw two sorts of expressions in his eyes: overflowing rage and surging murderous desire.

Earlier, Chu Feng was unable to be certain if that Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief planned to attack him. However at that moment, he was absolutely certain.

Regardless of whether or not that Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief would attack him before the day ended, he would definitely attack him one day.

Right at the moment when the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief reached the exit, Chu Feng suddenly spoke. “My apologies in making you journey here in vain.”

Since Chu Feng knew that the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief would not let him get away with it, he felt there to be no need to fear him. Since he was capable of mocking the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief, he would naturally have to ridicule him.

Upon hearing Chu Feng’s words, the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief not only suddenly stopped his footsteps, but a cold smile also emerged on his face.

“You thought that I’d come here for the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram?”

“You’re mistaken. This King has most definitely not journeyed here in vain.”

After he finished saying those words, the smile on his face grew even stranger.

Then, he left together with the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder.

“Chu Feng, that fellow’s smile was abnormal,” Her Lady Queen’s long, shapely eyebrows narrowed slightly. There was a bit of worry in her eyes. She had noticed the signal of danger from the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief’s strange smile.

As for Chu Feng, he was also frowning slightly. He thought to himself, ‘He meant to say that he had not come here for the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram at all.’

‘Could it be, he came for me?’

‘Had he come for me from the very start?’

At that moment, Chu Feng was startled.
