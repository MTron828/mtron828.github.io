Chapter 5425: Proving Our Strength Through Actions

“Yunqing, you have reached Purple Dragon God-cloak?” Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle was astonished.

He was well aware that Bai Yunqing was only at Blue Dragon God-cloak when he last left, and he shouldn’t have been anywhere close to making a breakthrough.

“Senior uncle, it’s all thanks to big brother Chu Feng’s help that I was able to make a breakthrough so quickly,” Bai Yunqing replied.

“Young friend Chu Feng helped you?” Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle looked at Chu Feng with conflicting emotions.

“Tsk! It’s no wonder you dare to run your mouth. Turns out that you made a breakthrough. Still, just because your spirit power is at the same level doesn’t mean that you’re on par with him. Do you honestly think that you’re better than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s young master Ling Hang?” Li Ta’er scoffed.

While she was surprised by Bai Yunqing’s breakthrough, she remained certain that Bai Yunqing was inferior to Ling Hang.

“Miss Li, are you implying that Bai Yunqing’s master is weak?” Chu Feng finally spoke up.

“What do you mean by that? Are you trying to drive a wedge between us?” Li Ta’er roared.

“Drive a wedge? Bai Yunqing’s master is a renowned world spiritist too, but you kept scorning Bai Yunqing. Isn’t that the same thing too?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s not what I mean. Don’t you talk rubbish!” Li Ta’er argued.

“Young friend Chu Feng, Ta’er might be tactless with her words, but she doesn’t mean that,” Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle interjected.

The two of them appeared to be rather afraid of Bai Yunqing’s master, or at the very least, neither of them wanted to be seen looking down on Bai Yunqing’s master. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Brother Bai, you mentioned earlier that it was thanks to Brother Chu that you were able to reach Purple Dragon God-cloak. That must mean that Brother Chu is stronger than the two of us. Since that’s the case, why don’t the three of us work together to perfect this formation?” Ling Hang offered with a smile.

“My thoughts exactly,” Bai Yunqing said. “Big brother Chu Feng, let’s do it together.”

“Sure.” Chu Feng nodded.

He was planning to offer Bai Yunqing some pointers to perfect the formation by himself, but he already had enough of Ling Hang’s hypocritical attitude.

For instance, the fact that Ling Hang knew their names and the content of their conversation showed that he had been paying attention to them, but he chose to turn a blind eye to them till Bai Yunqing said those words. That showed that the only thing he was concerned about was someone doubting his capability.

In fact, it was likely that his invitation to Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing was a trap.

“Wait a moment,” Ling Hang suddenly interjected while Chu Feng was making his way toward the formation. “I forgot to ask you, young master Chu Feng. What’s your current spirit power? Brother Bai and I will assist you if you have reached Purple Dragon God-cloak.”

Ling Hang was trying to mock Chu Feng’s spirit power. The rumors he had heard about Chu Feng after arriving at the Totem Galaxy led him to think that Chu Feng was a powerful cultivator but a weak world spiritist.

“My big brother Chu Feng is at Blue Dragon God-cloak,” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Blue Dragon God-cloak?” Ling Hang was taken aback, but he quickly continued, “Young master Chu Feng is indeed incredible, but I’m worried that your spirit power isn’t enough to perfect the formation.”

“Rest assured, young master Ling. My big brother Chu Feng might only be at Blue Dragon God-cloak, but the formations he constructs are comparable to that of a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist,” Bai Yunqing replied.

“Is that so?” Ling Hang laughed, but it was dripping with disdain.

“Bai Yunqing, are you out of your mind? Even if you want to compliment your big brother, there should be a limit to your bragging. How can a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist construct a formation comparable to a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist? Do you take us for fools?” Li Ta’er bellowed without the slightest hint of respect, almost as if Bai Yunqing was her servant.

Bai Yunqing wasn’t one to shy away from conflict. He didn’t show any fear toward Ling Hang, but for some reason, he didn’t snap back at Li Ta’er’s criticism.

“Are you a world spiritist too?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. I might be weaker than young master Ling Hang, but I am a Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.” To prove her own strength, Li Ta’er released a whiff of her spirit power.

“Since you’re a world spiritist, allow me to pose a question to you. Do you think that it’s possible for a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist like me to wield fighting prowess comparable to a rank four Half-God level cultivator?” Chu Feng asked.

“You brothers sure know to brag. Bai Yunqing said that your formations are comparable to a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, whereas you’re claiming that your fighting prowess is on par with rank four Half-God level cultivators. Everyone knows that Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists are equivalent to rank three Half-God level cultivators. Why would you be an exception to the rule? Do you take yourself for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Ling Xiao?”

All of a sudden, Chu Feng released his spirit power and constructed a slaughter formation to attack Li Ta’er. A figure immediately appeared in front of Li Ta’er to stop the slaughter formation. It was Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle.

“Young friend Chu Feng, what do you mean by this?” Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle asked with a voice tinged with rage.

Surprisingly, the arrogant Li Ta’er had fallen completely silent. She stared at Chu Feng in disbelief, as if she couldn’t believe that the latter had just made a move on her.

“Elder, I don’t intend to hurt your daughter. I just wanted to dispel her misunderstandings of me. Elder, would you mind telling everyone how strong my earlier formation was?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young friend Chu Feng’s formation is indeed comparable to rank four Half-God level cultivators. How rare it is for a God-cloak World Spiritist to possess heaven-defying battle power!” As soon as Bai Yunqing’s senior uncle finally calmed down, he began complimenting Chu Feng.

However, Ling Hang’s face soured.

“I just wanted to prove to your daughter that I wasn’t lying. Similarly, I’ll prove right now that my brother isn’t lying either.” Chu Feng walked up to the formation and asked Ling Hang, “Young master Ling, are you going to assist me?”

“Young master Chu Feng is indeed formidable. I am in awe. I don’t think that there are many world spiritists out there who can match your talent. However, young master Chu Feng, are you certain that you can construct a formation comparable to that of Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists?” Ling Hang posed his doubt.

Instead of arguing with Ling Hang, Chu Feng proceeded to construct a formation.

The crowd was taken aback. They weren’t able to fully ascertain it, but the formation Chu Feng was constructing did appear to be comparable to a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. While the formation didn’t wield any offensive ability, it was nevertheless a formidable feat.

Under Chu Feng’s efforts, it didn’t take long for the formation to light up.
