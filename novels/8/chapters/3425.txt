Chapter 3425 - Seven Realms Sacred Mansion

“Grandmaster, is the backlash very serious? You should have a way to treat them, right?” Linghu Hongfei asked.

“It should be possible to alleviate their backlash,” As Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke, he began to set up a spirit formation to treat the younger generations.

“Wuuu~~~”

However, at the moment when Grandmaster Liangqiu began to treat Linghu Yueyue and the others, Tang Zhenghao and the others fell to the ground in pain.

Apart from Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei, who were still completely fine, all of the people of the younger generation had fallen to the ground.

“What’s going on now? Didn’t they not enter the grand formation?” Seeing Tang Zhenghao and the others that were on the ground moaning in pain, Queen Mother Fox Immortal raised the question.

“It’s very normal for them to receive a backlash. Chengfeng, quickly, treat their injuries,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

When Grandmaster Liangqiu said that it was normal for them to receive a backlash, Queen Mother Fox Immortal and the others immediately understood what was going on.

Although Tang Zhenghao and the other people of the younger generation had not entered the World Spiritist Immortal King’s grand formation, they had put forth a lot of effort inside the palace spirit formation that they’d set up.

Although it was mostly thanks to Chu Feng’s outstanding service that they were able to make a breakthrough in world spirit techniques, they would not have been able to make a breakthrough had it not been for Tang Zhenghao and the others, who continued to activate the palace spirit formation to guide the power from the grand formation.

Thus, Tang Zhenghao and the others were actually sustaining a very intense power. As such, it was very normal for them to receive a backlash.

Merely, the backlash that they received was not caused by the grand formation. Instead, it was caused by the palace spirit formation set up by Queen Mother Fox Immortal and the others.

Thus, at that moment, not only did Liangqiu Chengfeng start to treat them, but Queen Mother Fox Immortal, Wuming Xingyun and Grandmaster Long Xuan also joined Liangqiu Chengfeng in treating Tang Zhenghao and the others.

After all, their backlash was caused by them.

At that moment, Linghu Hongfei walked over to Chu Feng and clasped his fist at Chu Feng again, “Brother Chu Feng, truly, congratulations.”

The reason he did that was because Chu Feng had ignored his congratulations earlier.

However, to his surprise, Chu Feng actually ignored his congratulations again.

“Brother Chu Feng, are you alright?”

The gaze with which Linghu Hongfei looked to Chu Feng had changed somewhat.

The reason why he had actually attempted to congratulate Chu Feng again was because he had noticed that Chu Feng was acting strangely.

Even though Chu Feng did not scream in pain, there was no response from him.

Ever since Chu Feng had assimilated with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, he has been covered completely in light. One simply could not see his face at all, much less his current expression.

In truth, something strange was indeed happening to Chu Feng. He had entered a dream.

Inside this dreamland, Chu Feng saw an old man.

Chu Feng was unable to see the old man’s appearance clearly. However, he was able to feel the aura emitted by the old man. It was simply too powerful, so powerful that it could obliterate everything.

It was a heroic aura that feared nothing in the entire world.

It was a tyrannical aura that cowed everyone in the entire world.

Chu Feng could tell that that old man should be the World Spiritist Immortal King. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Furthermore, he was most definitely not a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, but a legendary God-cloak World Spiritist. Otherwise... how could he possess such power?

Even though it was only an image, it was already so very powerful that one would not dare to show any disrespect towards it.

“The Nine Dragons Saint Cloak is not an ordinary world spiritist cloak. It is something that this old man constructed using the Nine Dragons Aura. Although it only contains a small amount of Nine Dragons Aura, it is still extremely extraordinary.”

“The treasure that this old man has personally created will definitely not be handed to ordinary individuals. If you’re an ordinary individual, even if you are to obtain it, you will not be able to use it.”

“However, if you are one day able to connect with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak’s Nine Dragon Aura, it would mean that you are an extraordinary person. At that time, you will learn of the actual power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.”

“Junior, if you are able to accomplish great things in the future, you can come and find me. I also wish to see what sort of person from the desolate Ancestral Martial Starfield is be able to breach this old man’s spirit formation and obtain this old man’s treasure.”

“Remember, this old man is called the World Spiritist Immortal King. I will wait for you at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

“If you are able to arrive there one day, show them the imprint on your palm. Even if it’s the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, no one will dare to stop you.”

After the World Spiritist Immortal King finished saying those words, he pointed at Chu Feng, and a ray of light, like an arrow, shot toward him.

At the same moment when the World Spiritist Immortal King raised his arm, Chu Feng’s arm also rose involuntarily. Chu Feng’s palm spread open, and was hit by the ray of light.

At that moment, Chu Feng felt his palm burning hot. He raised his head to look, and discovered that an imprint had appeared on his palm. That imprint appeared to be an ancient symbol.

Chu Feng did not understand what significance the imprint possessed. However, the name ‘Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,’ had raised a major wave in his heart.

How could Chu Feng not know what sort of place the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was?

It was the ruler of the Seven Realms Galaxy, an actual colossal power situated within the vast and boundless martial cultivation world.

It was also the place where the strongest world spiritists in the entire martial cultivation world gathered.

However, if that was all there were to it, Chu Feng’s heart would not have wavered like that.

The reason for Chu Feng’s reaction was because... the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was the place where his mother was imprisoned!!!

“Senior, you’re someone from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

Chu Feng raised his head and looked to the World Spiritist Immortal King. His gaze had changed.

However, the World Spiritist Immortal King had already disappeared.

“I am truly foolish. That was nothing more than an image left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King. If he’s in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, he’ll be extremely far from me. Even if he’s a God-cloak World Spiritist, he will likely still not be able to leave an image that could connect to his consciousness.”

As a world spiritist himself, Chu Feng knew very well what world spiritists were capable of.

Back in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm’s Nine Provinces Continent, Chu Feng had encountered an image left behind by a world spiritist in a remnant that had connected with that world spiritist’s consciousness.

However, that was in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

The Ancestral Martial Lower Realm not only possessed weak natural energies, but it also possessed a weak suppression of natural energies. Furthermore, its surface area was also relatively small.

If the current Chu Feng were to return to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, then, with his strength, he would be able to appear anywhere that he wanted to in nearly an instant.

He would possess power akin to gods. He would be able to do as he pleased.

However, that was impossible in the Upper Realms. In fact, it would be impossible even in the Ordinary Realms.

The reason for that was because of the different intensity of natural energies, the suppression of natural energies and the surface area between the different realms.

Because of that, even though one might possess the same level of cultivation and world spirit techniques, one would display different intensities of power.

Because of that, Chu Feng felt that it was only an image.

Chu Feng felt that the distance between galaxies was simply too vast. He felt that no matter how powerful a world spiritist might be, it would still be impossible for them to maintain a connection with their image over such a long distance.

“Grandmaster Liangqiu, what’s wrong with Chu Feng?”

At that moment, Wuming Xingyun also noticed that Chu Feng had been motionless ever since he had donned the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. Thus, he questioned Grandmaster Liangqiu through a voice transmission.

“I think that the World Spiritist Immortal King must’ve left something for Chu Feng to comprehend.”

“It is also possible that Chu Feng is overjoyed from obtaining the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.”

“After all, becoming a Saint-cloak World Spiritist was already an exceptional accomplishment.”

“That’s even more the case now, since he has also obtained the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak in addition to becoming a Saint-cloak World Spiritist,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

“What Grandmaster says is very true. To become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist at such a young age, that is something I dreamed about in my youth.”

“However, after I realized how powerful Saint-cloak World Spiritists were, I no longer had any hope for that dream.”

“After all, Saint-cloak World Spiritists were simply too powerful. Thus, I felt that dream to be simply impossible to realize.”

“I truly never imagined that, after all these years, the dream that I could not achieve was realized by someone else,” Wuming Xingyun spoke with great admiration.

The reason why he was acting like that was because he, as a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, knew very well just how powerful Saint-cloak World Spiritists were!!!
