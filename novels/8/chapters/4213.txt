Chapter 4213 - Offer You An Opportunity

“Beast Tamer, you can rest assured. I, Tang Chen, will definitely not break my promise.”

“That’s right, I’ve lost. I, Tang Chen, am capable of accepting loss with grace.”

As Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke, he took out a map from his Cosmos Sack.

The map was yellow in color, and appeared to have been made of sheepskin. The map emitted a strong ancient aura, and was damaged.

When he saw the map, Yuan Shu immediately felt his heart grow tense.

At the same time, the shame and guilt he felt reached a peak.

He had not expected his master to actually use the Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain as a gambling stake against the Revered Master Beast Tamer.

He had no idea about their gamble.

But, even if he had known about it, what could he possibly do?

With his opponent coming to his door, how could he avoid the fight?

In the end, it was because his skills were inferior.

When he thought of this, the guilt that Yuan Shu felt grew even more intense.

“That incomplete map!”

What Yuan Shu and the others didn’t know was that Chu Feng had a look of surprise when he saw the incomplete map.

He had not only obtained the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted; he had also obtained some other treasures.

Among them were five incomplete maps that emitted an Ancient Era’s aura.

Those incomplete maps were identical to the one that Grandmaster Tang Chen took out.

Furthermore, from the reaction of Grandmaster Tang Chen and Revered Master Beast Tamer, Chu Feng could tell that those incomplete maps seemed to possess an extraordinary origin.

“Woosh---”

Grandmaster Tang Chen waved his arm and tossed the Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain to Revered Master Beast Tamer.

He caught the incomplete map and beamed with happiness. His smile was so large that the corners of his mouth were about to reach behind his ears. He was truly overjoyed.

“Tang Chen, among all of us, this old man had the least amount of Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain. I only have two.”

“But things are different now. I now have three in my possession.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“If my memory serves me correctly, you had four in your possession. Now that you’ve lost one to this old man, you should have three incomplete maps left, no?” the Revered Master Beast Tamer asked with a beaming, complacent smile. That smile of his was truly disgusting.

“What does the amount of incomplete maps I have matter to you?”

“The gamble we made staked only a single incomplete map,” Grandmaster Tang Chen said with a stern voice.

“Of course I know that. It’s just...”

“Hehe...”

“How about, we make another gamble?” Revered Master Beast Tamer proposed with a grin.

“Who would’ve thought that you’re actually this courageous?”

“Are you planning to compete with martial power or world spirit techniques?” asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.

He even took a step toward Revered Master Beast Tamer as he spoke.

“No, no, no...”

Revered Master Beast Tamer immediately shook his head and waved his hand repeatedly as he backed away from Grandmaster Tang Chen..

It could be seen that he was afraid of him.

“Brother Tang Chen, don’t think I don’t know you’ve already reached Martial Exalted. I’m still only a peak Utmost Exalted. If we are to compete in martial power, how could I possibly be a match for you?” Revered Master Beast Tamer said with a smile.

“I can do world spirit techniques too,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“We can forget about world spirit techniques too. If we are to compete with that, it’ll go on with no end.”

“Why don’t we have our disciples compete again?” Revered Master Beast Tamer asked with a beaming smile.

“Are you doing this on purpose?” Grandmaster Tang Chen revealed his displeasure.

Their disciples had already sparred earlier. His disciple Yuan Shu had already lost.

For Revered Master Beast Tamer to request another match between their disciples now was simply an act of wanting to gain more benefit from a known outcome. That was simply too excessive.

“Hehe, I’m merely joking. Why take it so seriously?”

“Actually, this old man only came here with the intention of paying you a visit.”

“I only suddenly recalled the gamble we had made upon learning that your disciple had also grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation. That’s why I had them spar with one another.”

“I most definitely didn’t come here for your incomplete map.”

“Since I got to see you, I am content with my journey here.”

“Judging from the time, it’s about time for that Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain to open. At that time, world spiritists from all over will be present. I’ve heard that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted has also exited his closed-door training ahead of time all for the sake of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.”

“I presume that brother Tang Chen will also be going there.”

“In that case, let us meet again at the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.”

“That being said, I must still thank brother Tang Chen.”

“After all, this incomplete map will be extremely useful inside the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain,” Revered Master Beast Tamer said with a beaming smile.

After saying those words, he intended to leave.

Grandmaster Tang Chen had a look of displeasure clearly written on his face.

He knew very well that Revered Master Beast Tamer had come precisely for his incomplete map.

Now that he had won an incomplete map, he actually still dared to say such a thing. It had truly angered Grandmaster Tang Chen.

The truth was that if Grandmaster Tang Chen wanted to act as a sore loser, Revered Master Beast Tamer would not be able to do anything about it.

After all, Grandmaster Tang Chen surpassed him in all aspects.

Unfortunately, although Grandmaster Tang Chen had a bad temper, he was someone who cared about his reputation a lot.

Besides, it was true that Yuan Shu had been defeated thoroughly in the sparring match.

As such, he could not go back on his promise.

“Wait.”

Right when Revered Master Beast Tamer and his disciple Li Fengxue were leaving, Chu Feng suddenly called out to them.

“Are you speaking to me?”

Revered Master Beast Tamer immediately narrowed his brows slightly after being called out by Chu Feng.

He had a look of great displeasure as he looked at him. He felt that someone like Chu Feng simply wasn’t qualified to speak to him.

“Senior, you seem to be very interested in this Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain’s incomplete map.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out an incomplete map from his Cosmos Sack.

Seeing the map, Revered Master Beast Tamer’s eyes started shining.

Even Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Li Fengxue were greatly surprised.

None of them had anticipated that Chu Feng would actually possess a treasure as precious as an Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

“Brat, why would you have an Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain?” Revered Master Beast Tamer asked with a stern voice.

He was excited. Even the tone of his voice had changed.

“Senior doesn’t have to worry about that. That said, if senior is truly interested in this incomplete map, this junior is willing to offer senior an opportunity,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Opportunity?”

“What do you mean?” Revered Master Beast Tamer was completely confused. He didn’t understand Chu Feng’s intentions.
