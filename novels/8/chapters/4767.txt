Chapter 4767: Lost the Bet?

Nangong Yuliu’s arrival had left an ominous premonition in the hearts of the North Tortoise Hall’s elders. Even though Nangong Yuliu was weaker than Xia Yan, his background was still nothing to make light of.

Chu Feng was able to overcome the crisis with Xia Ran through his relationship with Xia Yan, but it wouldn’t be that easy to deal with Nangong Yuliu here. Everyone knew deep well the reason why he was here today.

The chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall carefully scanned the surroundings, and upon noticing Chu Feng’s approach, he quickly sent a voice transmission over to tell him to stay away.

Unexpectedly, Chu Feng hastened his speed instead, passing through the crowd to stand before Nangong Yuliu.

“You sure came fast,” Chu Feng said.

“You still dare to come back? I thought that you would have already hidden somewhere, not daring to show up.”

Nangong Yuliu was also surprised to see Chu Feng, but his tone swiftly turned sarcastic as he said, “I guess you do know that you can’t possibly hide from me forever too. You’ll eventually have to face the consequences of what you did. I’ve already prepared the token that you’ll be wearing around your neck.”

Nangogn Yuliu took out a token from his Cosmos Sack. The faces of the chief elder and the others immediately darkened upon seeing it, and the surrounding disciples also started gossiping fervently.

Chu Feng and Nangong Yuliu had made a bet on whether Chu Feng was able to break the record left by Lord Dugu Lingtian in the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. If Chu Feng won, Nangong Yuliu would have to apologize to Zhao Shi and allow the latter to strike him ten times. Otherwise, Chu Feng would have to wear a token Nangong Yuliu prepared for him, never to take it off.

And now, the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake’s trial was over, but Chu Feng didn’t break Lord Dugu Lingtian’s record. This meant that he had lost the bet.

The token Nangong Yuliu prepared had a leash and a chain, reminiscent of a dog’s collar. It was obvious that he was insulting Chu Feng for being a dog.

However, the words on the token were even more humiliating, writing ‘I am Nangong Yuliu’s dog’.

Nangong Yuliu tossed the token toward Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, put it on.”

Chu Feng caught the token and assessed it carefully. Everyone was eyeing Chu Feng intently, wondering if he would really put this humiliating collar around his neck. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

However, Chu Feng simply chuckled softly and tossed the token back toward one of Nangong Yuliu’s lackeys. He might not have said a word at all, but the meaning of his action was clear.

He was scorning those around Nangong Yuliu for being his dog.

“Chu Feng, do you not intend to honor the bet you made?” Nangong Yuliu asked.

“Nangong Yuliu, why didn’t you participate in the hunt at the Vicious Beast Hellworld despite being a personal disciple?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ll do whatever I want to. It’s none of your business. We have a lot of eye-witnesses for the bet we made, and I’ll make sure that you honor the bet whether you want to or not,” Nangong Yuliu said.

“Ah, what a pity... If you had been in the Vicious Beast Hellworld, you would have never done something as foolish as this,” Chu Feng said.

Nangong Yuliu had no idea what Chu Feng was speaking of, but he felt that Chu Feng was trying to shirk off his promise by refusing to wear the token. So, his eyes turned cold as he said, “Are you waiting for me to put it on for you?”

“Nangong Yuliu, I’m not a person who doesn’t honor my promise. It’s just that I’ve no reason to put on that token. It looks like you’ve wasted your effort here,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, stop putting on an act, I’ve heard that you’ve managed to find a backing in Xia Yan, but even if you have her support, you’ll still have to honor your promise. This is a rule of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Since you’re unwilling to put it on, I’ll help you on that,” Nangong Yuliu said.

He rose into the air and charged straight toward Chu Feng. However, before Nangong Yuliu could get close, numerous figures had already rushed in to stand in front of Chu Feng in order to protect him.

They were the elders and chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall.

“Nangong Yuliu, our North Tortoise Hall isn’t a place where you can mess around!”

The chief elder put on a strong front this time around, but Nangong Yuliu thought nothing of it at all.

“Even if you can stop me, can you stop my grandmother? This is a bet between me and Chu Feng. He’ll have to fulfill the end of his promise eventually. So, I advise you not to get involved in things that don’t concern you. You’ll just end up burning yourself!” Nangong Yuliu sneered.

The chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall still resolutely stood his ground, refusing to allow Nangong Yuliu to harm Chu Feng. However, before he could say anything, Chu Feng had already interjected, “I appreciate your goodwill, but there’s no need for this. I’m willing to acknowledge my bet with Nangong Yuliu, but since I didn’t lose the bet, there’s no way I would put on that collar.”

“You’re saying that you didn’t lose the bet? The name above the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake is still Lord Dugu Lingtian’s. That should be more than enough evidence to prove that you have failed to break his record!” Nangong Yuliu said.

“Don’t you think that it’s inappropriate of you to be spreading baseless accusations without verifying the matter in person? Why don’t we do this instead? We’ll all head to the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake together and determine the victor of this bet once and for all,” Chu Feng said.

He rose into the air and began flying in the direction of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake.

The chief elder and the others also quickly followed him too. They were intending to protect Chu Feng if a fight broke out.

The other spectators also didn’t wish to miss this commotion, so they quickly tagged along as well.

One of the subordinates standing behind Nangong Yuliu stood forward and asked, “Senior Nangong, why is Chu Feng so confident about this? Is it possible that... he might make a turnaround here?”

“I checked it with my own eyes earlier on. Lord Dugu Lingtian’s name is still hanging above the mountains,” Nangong Yuliu replied.

“Then what’s he trying to do then? Is he trying to humiliate himself?” the subordinate asked uncomprehendingly.

“He’s just delaying the inevitable. Since he wants to play with us, let’s go along with him then,” Nangong Yuliu sneered in disdain as he rose into the air and headed toward the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake too.

The Blackwater Sixfinger Lake was usually closed, but the transparent barrier allowed one to see the situation inside. News that Chu Feng and Nangong Yuliu were heading to the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake to determine the outcome of their bet swiftly spread within the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

Those from the other three halls swiftly joined in the procession toward the lake too, curious to see how this bet would end.

However, as soon as they came into proximity with the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake, the faces of the chief elder and the others began stiffening nervously. Similarly, those who wished for Chu Feng’s loss began to smile brightly.

They might not have arrived yet, but they could see the huge name above the six peaks of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake.

Dugu Lingtian.

“Chu Feng, what else do you wish to say for yourself?”

Nangong Yuliu was so gleeful that he could hardly conceal his joy. He was delighted to see that Chu Feng was going to be humiliated before this huge crowd.

“What are you in a rush for? Take a closer look.”

Chu Feng swiftly began forming a series of hand seals.

Weng!

The next moment, the six peaks of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake began shining brightly, lighting up the dark sky!
