Chapter 5768: Who’s the King of the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline?

“Everyone, it’s fine. If he dares to challenge me, I dare to accept it.” Chu Feng pulled his hand away from Little Fishy’s grasp. “I’d like to see what he’s up to.”

Chu Feng leaped onto the weird stone platform and immediately felt a surge of energy entering his body. A smile crept onto his lips as he remarked, “I see.”

He already knew what the formation was for. It was a valuable treasure, but it could only be used once. That explained why Huangfu Jiangyao and the others showed conflicted looks when Huangfu Shengyu used it—they thought that it was a pity to use it here.

“Chu Feng, I thought you’d have an amazing Heavenly Lightning Bloodline after you induced such a formidable phenomenon.” Huangfu Shengyu noticed how relaxed Chu Feng was after stepping onto the stone platform and burst into laughter, though his smile looked extremely ugly as his face was warped in pain.

“Is there something wrong with you? You’re acting so smug even though Chu Feng is having it so much easier than you,” Feng Ling retorted.

“You don’t know a thing at all. This is a dueling ring for possessors of the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline to pit their bloodlines against each other. The stronger the bloodline, the greater the energy they have to bear. Naturally, they would be in greater pain too. Chu Feng is only having it easy because his bloodline is too weak,” Huangfu Jiangyao explained.

“A bunch of ignorant fools. There’s no need to explain it to them.” Huangfu Shengyu kept his eyes on Chu Feng, paying no heed to the crowd’s thoughts.

“Dueling ring? Damn it!” Little Fishy cursed as she prepared to step into the dueling ring.

Of what Huangfu Jiangyao said, the only two words that registered with her were ‘dueling ring’. Clearly, this was a trap the despicable Huangfu Shengyu had laid for Chu Feng.

Just as Little Fishy was about to make a move, Xianhai Shaoyu stopped her and said, “Calm down, my little sister. Just watch the situation first. As long as I’m around, I won’t allow anyone to take advantage of your big brother.”

“Chu Feng, you defeated me yesterday through your world spirit, but how could you, as a possessor of the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, choose to focus on your spirit power instead of your martial cultivation? You are an embarrassment to the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline!

“Today, I shall show you how powerful the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline is. Everything else is worthless before it, and this includes the Ruler’s Bloodline. The Heavenly Lightning Bloodline is the strongest bloodline in the world of cultivation, towering above all other bloodlines!” Huangfu Shengyu exclaimed.

His surroundings started to tremble. Dark clouds swiftly rolled in and shrouded the clear sky, as lightning crackled ominously within.

Huangfu Shengyu had induced a phenomenon, and it wasn’t just limited to the sky!

Grar!

A piercing howl echoed, as Huangfu Shengyu unleashed a nine-colored lightning that morphed into the shape of nine colossal beasts. These lightning beasts were over ten thousand meters in height, which wasn’t particularly big, but the auras they emanated were even more terrifying than the clouds above. The crowd trembled in fear.

“Is this your bloodline? Saint-tier?” Chu Feng asked.

“Still putting on an act? The disparity in bloodline power marks one’s standing. You should kneel down and submit to me!” Huangfu Shengyu said.

Pain had vanished from his face, leaving behind a domineering attitude. He had never lost on this dueling ring before with his Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline. No matter how strong Chu Feng’s world spirit was, it didn’t stand a chance against him in this dueling ring.

Cultivation didn’t matter on this dueling ring—all that mattered was the prowess of one’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline. Even if a True God level cultivator stepped onto the dueling ring instead of Chu Feng, they would still have no choice but to submit to Huangfu Shengyu if their bloodline was weaker than his.

“Is this the true prowess of the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline? I didn’t think it would be this powerful!”

The surrounding crowd frowned upon seeing the bloodline power Huangfu Shengyu emanated. As much as they didn’t like Huangfu Shengyu, they had to admit that he was strong.

“Heh…”

In contrast, Chu Feng shook his head and chuckled. His eyes suddenly turned grim, and a surge of nine-colored lightning burst forth from his body.

Boom!

The world shook so much that everyone had trouble keeping their balance. The burst of lightning was so powerful that it dissipated the dark clouds above and enveloped the sky as if proclaiming the area to be their domain.

It was another nine lightning beasts, but they were so massive that they covered the entire area. It was impossible to gauge their sizes. This formed a stark contrast to the nine lightning beasts Huangfu Shengyu had manifested.

Huangfu Shengyu’s lightning beasts might be ten thousand meters high, but they were no more than ants before Chu Feng’s lightning beasts,

“This feeling! What’s going on?”

Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, Xianhai Shaoyu, Xianhai Yu’er, Xian Miaomiao, and the other possessors of bloodline powers felt incredible pressure coming from their souls. Even those who had Divine Bodies or practiced Mysterious Techniques felt the pressure too, though it was not as great as possessors of bloodline powers.

The ones who suffered the most were those with the Heavenly Bloodline, such as the Huangfus. Huangfu Jiangyao and the others kneeled on the floor the moment the nine lightning beasts appeared, not because they wanted to kneel down but because their knees had caved in.

“W-w-what’s going on?”

Huangfu Jiangyao and the others stared at the nine lightning beasts with trembling lips. They knew what was going on, as possessors of the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline themselves, but they couldn’t accept it.

For what they were witnessing was the prowess of Chu Feng’s bloodline. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
