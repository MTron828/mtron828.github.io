MGA: Chapter 390 - Change Starting

Within the Prestigious Villa’s palace that Chu Feng lived in, he laid layers of Spirit Formations from the inside, and in the centre of the palace there was even a Spirit Formation surrounded by floating light.

In the heart of the formation, Chu Feng’s Asura Ghost Axe was inserted in it.

Chu Feng sat cross-leggedly and he sat in front of the Asura Ghost Axe. Occasionally, his eyebrows slightly raised, and occasionally, they lightly relaxed. On his tranquil face, barely detectable feelings were endlessly changing.

“Haha, success! Eggy, you succeeded! You’ve successfully pulled out the special effects from this Asura Ghost Axe!” Finally, Chu Feng opened his eyes and he directly jumped up from the ground from happiness and he was so excited that he could almost dance.

Because, it was the same as what Eggy said. The Asura Ghost Axe was truly a treasure that could hone Spirit power and as long as one bonded with the formation, then channel their Spirit power into the Asura Ghost Axe, then connect to the mysterious object in the axe, there would be the effect of raising Spirit power

“This formation is only the experimental version. After the Marriage Gathering ends, find a spacious and hidden area to cultivate. I can then lay the complete formation and only at that time can I truly display the Asura Ghost Axe’s effects of honing Spirit power.” Eggy said.

“Eggy, many thanks to you. If it wasn’t for you, perhaps I wouldn’t even have discovered the obscurity in this Asura Ghost Axe, and I wouldn’t have known that this is the treasure which could train one’s Spirit power.” Chu Feng felt true gratitude that came from his heart towards Eggy.

“Che, of course! Who can even be compared to my intelligence and wit?”

“But you’re not stupid either. Even if I didn’t remind you, I believe that after carefully studying it, you would certainly look back at this small detail.” Eggy’s little face raised and her smile was called sweet. Obviously, she also really liked Chu Feng’s praise.

“As long as I become a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, I can save the monkey Monstrous Beast in the Asura Ghost Tower, and at that time, Su Rou and Su Mei can be saved as well. Also, as long as I become a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, I can open the World Spirit Gate and freedom can be restored to you.”

Chu Feng’s face was filled with yearning because he felt that the effects of the Asura Ghost Axe was truly very good. Perhaps before a year, his Spirit power could be so strong to the point where he could link with the power of blue-coloured Spirit Formations and at that time, he would also become a Blue-cloak World Spiritist.

“Your thoughts are too simple, and it isn’t that easy to become a Blue-cloak World Spiritist. If your body isn’t strong enough, your Spiritual World isn’t strong enough.”

“Usually speaking, when a cultivator’s cultivation hasn’t reached the Heaven realm yet, their Spiritual World will have no way of enduring the stress of blue-coloured Spirit Formation power, let alone using the blue-coloured Spirit Formation power.” Eggy struck blows on his spirit.

“What? Heaven realm? Can it be that my body, my Spiritual World, also have no way of enduring the blue-coloured Spirit Formation power and I must reach the Heaven realm first?”

Chu Feng who had extreme confidence in his own physical body never would have thought that he himself was also unable to break through that restriction.

However, Zi Ling hadn’t stepped into the Heaven realm as well, yet she was already a Blue-cloak World Spiritist. Was it possible that his body was truly inferior to a Divine Body?

“Your body is very strong, and in certain places, it is even stronger than Zi Ling’s body.”

“But it is not so strong that you can fight against Heaven realm cultivators. On the journey of martial cultivation, or on the road of Spirit Formations, there is always a corresponding restriction and a certain limit.”

“Some people can indeed break through that limit and escape the bindings, but there’s still a range for that.”

“According to my calculations, if you want to gain the power of blue-coloured Spirit Formations and become a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, you must raise your current cultivation of the 3rd level of the Profound realm to the 7th level of the Profound realm. When you have the cultivation of the 7th level of the Profound realm, you should be able to link to the power of blue-coloured Spirit Formation.” Eggy explained.

“So it must be the 7th level of the Profound realm? Then what if I raise it to the 5th level of the Profound realm, then use the power of the two types of lightning and raise my cultivation to the 7th level of the Profound realm?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course that won’t work. The Divine Lightning can indeed strengthen your cultivation, but even if it is in your blood, it is, after all, still external power. Your Spiritual World’s endurance power is only related to the cultivation of your body itself. It must be your own cultivation that is raised to the 7th level of the Profound realm in order for it to work.” Eggy explained.

“The distance to the 7th level of the Profound realm is still four levels. The resources required for every level is extremely huge, and the further I go, the more it will multiply. Within the time of less than two years, can I succeed?”

Chu Feng tightly frowned and his gaze started to glitter. He felt huge pressure because if he did not succeed, the ones being sent to the grave were Su Rou and Su Mei, two females whom he loved.

“You will succeed. You need to believe in yourself because even I believe you in such a way.” Eggy consoled.

“Thank you. Eggy, with you accompanying by my side, I believe that I can do it.” Only after hearing Eggy’s words did Chu Feng put away his worried complexion and a hint of smile rose from the corners of his mouth.

On the road, if it wasn’t for Eggy, no one could say for sure how many times Chu Feng would have died. No matter how much more powerful he was, after all, he was still a young person. His experience was limited and his character wasn’t mature enough. But Eggy filled in his weaknesses and taught him how to grow.

*dong dong dong, dong dong dong*

“Chu Feng, Chu Feng, I know that you’re here. Quickly open the door, quickly!!” But just at that time, the big doors of the palace was knocked while an urgent voice rang out.

Seeing that, Chu Feng hurriedly put away the Asura Ghost Axe, dissipated the Spirit Formations and quickly after, arrived in front of the palace and opened the door.

*swish* And just as Chu Feng opened the door, a body rushed in. It was Gu Bo.

At that instant, Gu Bo’s expression was panicked and sweat permeated his head. After stepping into the palace, he quickly closed the palace door and laid a sound-proofing Spirit Formation as he did that. Only then did he grab onto Chu Feng’s shoulders and say, Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Chu Feng, this isn’t good. You need to quickly leave! If you don’t, it’s very likely that you will lose your life!”

“Gu Bo, what’s the matter? What happened?” Chu Feng calmly asked.

“Long story short, I already know about you getting the Elite Armament. Vice-head Gao told me.”

“Right now, he got me to tell you to leave this place right now because from the delusions of Jie Yan, the Yuangang School, Fire God School, Hidden White Sect, Free and Unrestrained Valley, Sword God Valley, and the Prestigious Villa want to join hands with the Jie clan to forcefully take your Asura Ghost Axe away.”

“Something like that actually happened? Despite me being a part of the World Spirit Guild? Do they dare to ignore the existence of the World Spirit Guild?” Chu Feng’s brows slightly furrowed. The reason why he dared to relievedly return to this place was because he knew that the World Spirit Guild would protect him, but right now, the situation clearly changed.

“That was then, and now is now. Jie Yan made up lies and said that your Asura Ghost Axe is not only a simple Elite Armament, and that it contains endless Mysterious Techniques and martial skills within it and stores inexhaustible treasures.”

“He said that if one were to be able to grasp those Mysterious Techniques and martial skills, it would cause the strength of the eight-sided powers to increase significantly and possibly even break through the bindings of the Heaven realm to step into the realm of Martial Lords and become the Martial Lords of a generation.”

“When he said it like that, the other powers were all moved. Right now, they are like wolves and tigers and they swore to get your Asura Ghost Axe and to open it to obtain the treasures within. In this situation, my World Spirit Guild can no longer protect you or else they will join hands and attack my World Spirit Guild.” Gu Bo said.
