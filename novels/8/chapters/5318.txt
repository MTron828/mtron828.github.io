Chapter 5318: Unbelievable Power

“Damn it! How is she that powerful? Isn’t she just a rank one Half-God level world spirit?” Bai Yunqing’s face warped in shock. 

He hadn’t thought that Chu Feng’s world spirit was that powerful, and he was forced to reassess Eggy. 

“Submit to me right now, and I’ll consider sparing your life,” Chu Feng said.

“Submit to you? Do you think you’re worthy?”

Tzlala!

The Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor appeared around Bai Yunqing. His cultivation rose from rank two Half-God level to rank four Half-God level.

“Do you take me, Bai Yunqing, to be a pushover? No matter how powerful your world spirit is, she’s only at rank one Half-God level. She won’t be able to protect you. You should be the one submitting to me instead!” Bai Yunqing roared.

Boom!

Eggy raised her palm and gathered her gaseous black flame, which morphed into a massive hand that smacked down on Bai Yunqing. 

Her attack was so fast that Bai Yunqing didn’t have time to dodge at all. He was struck squarely and sent hurtling out of the formation he had created himself.

The juniors of the Ancient Realm were still worrying about Chu Feng when they saw Bai Yunqing flying across the air and violently crashing against the wall. The entire underground hall trembled under the force. 

Astonished, the juniors of the Ancient Realm turned to look at Eggy, only to fall into a daze.

“Waa, she’s beautiful.” 

Both men and women opened their mouths in awe as Eggy walked out of the shattered barrier. They had never seen such a beautiful woman before.

“D-don’t hit me! I’ll admit defeat, alright? I’ll swear in front of everyone here that I’ll take Chu Feng as my big brother from this day onward. I’ll follow his instructions for this test. Stop hitting me!” 

Bai Yunqing clutched his stomach while spewing blood. A few of his teeth and bones had shattered. With just a single strike, Eggy had nearly taken his life.

“Do you think that begging for mercy will work?” Eggy showed no inclination to stop. She had long gotten enough of Bai Yunqing’s nonsense and wanted to teach him a lesson.

“Forget it, Eggy,” Chu Feng said.

He was afraid that Bai Yunqing would lose his life at this rate. While there was a grudge between him and Bai Yunqing, he didn’t think that it was the right time to kill the latter.

“Remember your words. I’ll take your life if you dare to play any tricks,” Eggy said murderously before leaving via the world spirit gate. 

“Are you fine?” Chu Feng asked.

“Can’t you see with your own eyes? Do I look fine to you? This is too much. Do you really have to go this far? We’re one team!” Bai Yunqing grumbled in indignance. He popped his shattered teeth back in before gulping down a recovery pill. 

“Get up if you’re fine. Don’t waste our time. We’re still in the midst of a test now, and there’s a time limit,” Chu Feng said.

“Where did you find your world spirit? She’s vicious.” Bai Yunqing winced in pain as he slowly got back to his feet. 

“It’s my charm,” Chu Feng replied.

“Hah,” Bai Yunqing scoffed. He grudgingly conceded, “I’ve underestimated you.”

Chu Feng ignored Bai Yunqing and instead walked a few steps forward. He pointed at the wall and said, “Cut the crap and work on the formation here.”

The juniors of the Ancient Realm were confused to hear Chu Feng’s words. 

They were world spiritists who had participated in this test to prove themselves. They didn’t want to just rely on Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing here. For that, they had been scanning their surroundings ever since they entered this underground hall, and they hadn’t discovered any formations around. 

Yet, Bai Yunqing walked over to the wall Chu Feng had pointed out and said, “A walk in the park. Leave it to me. My world spirit might not be as strong as yours, but I’m still a stronger world spiritist than you.”

Bai Yunqing began constructing a deciphering formation on the wall.

Boom!

The wall violently shook before light surfaced on it.

“There really is a formation there? Amazing!” 

The juniors of the Ancient Realm were thoroughly impressed, not just with Chu Feng but Bai Yunqing too. While they were still struggling to uncover the formation, Bai Yunqing had already deciphered it, which meant to say that he had also noticed the formation too.

Three rocks appeared in the wall after the light dissipated. A word was written on each of the rocks—’Easy’, ‘Intermediate’, and ‘Hard’.

“This must be referring to the difficulty of the test. You’re lucky that I cleared the formation, which gave us the right to choose. If I hadn’t cleared the formation, we would have been left to the whims of this place,” Bai Yunqing said gleefully.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng kicked the rock with the word ‘Hard’ written on it. The rock dissolved into a wisp of air that surged at the crowd before flowing back to its original location and forming back into a rock. 

Boom!

The three rocks first receded into the wall before a surge of spirit power gushed out from the wall and enveloped the underground hall. Everyone could sense that something had changed about the underground hall.

“Are you out of your mind? Why did you choose hard?” Bai Yunqing berated Chu Feng with widened eyes.

“What’s wrong? Are you afraid?” Chu Feng asked.

“Afraid? How could I possibly be afraid? I-I…” Bai Yunqing was afraid, but he refused to admit it. 

Having been to many remnants with his master, he could tell that the difficulty of the test here was adjusted according to the individual’s strength. Choosing ‘Hard’ here meant that the test would really be hard for them. The wiser choice here would be to choose ‘Intermediate’.

It was just a pity that Chu Feng had already chosen on their behalf.

“Hurry up and continue deciphering the formations. You should be more proactive as a little brother,” Chu Feng said.

“You!!!” Bai Yunqing glared at Chu Feng. 

He was incensed at being spoken to in such a manner, but his courage wavered when he recalled Eggy. In the end, he decided to obey Chu Feng’s orders and continue deciphering the formations. 

Bai Yunqing might not be a decent person, but he was a skilled world spiritist. He was able to easily breach most of the formations along the way. Initially, he was still more than happy to do the job, seeing it as an opportunity to flaunt his skills, but as the formation got more intricate, his complaints correspondingly increased. 

A barrier was currently blocking their way. Everyone in Chu Feng’s team could sense just how sturdy the barrier was, and even Bai Yunqing was having a tough time breaching it. 

“You aren’t hitting the right spot. Shift your focus leftward and concentrate your spirit power there,” Chu Feng told Bai Yunqing. 

“Are you teaching me how to breach a formation?” Bai Yunqing turned around and glared at Chu Feng.

“I’m just reminding you.” Chu Feng shrugged.

“Do I need you to remind me? You should know the difference between us. You’re at White Dragon God-cloak, whereas I am at Blue Dragon God-cloak. Do you really think that you’re better than me just because you got lucky against me at Lord Zhenlong’s remnant?” Bai Yunqing bellowed.

“Why are you getting so agitated at a simple reminder?” Chu Feng calmly replied.

It was not that Chu Feng had a good temper, but Bai Yunqing’s outburst was so childish that it was actually entertaining. He knew that Bai Yunqing was a very proud individual, but he still chose to pick on him along the way.  

“Don’t I have the right to get agitated? I was the one who breached all of the formations along the way! Why the heck are you the leader when I’m the one doing all the work?” Bai Yunqing yelled.

The juniors of the Ancient Realm thought that there was some sense to what Bai Yunqing had said. Other than their initial clash, where Chu Feng defeated Bai Yunqing with his world spirit, Chu Feng had hardly lifted a finger at all, leaving all of the work to Bai Yunqing.

It was clear to them that Bai Yunqing had contributed more to the team. 

Chu Feng sensed the change in the atmosphere and said with a smile, “It looks like you still aren’t willing to submit to me, Bai Yunqing.”

“You…” Bai Yunqing suddenly felt flustered. He was worried that Chu Feng would bring out Eggy once more. 

“Chu Feng, you better not send your world spirit at me. I’m telling you now, my feelings are justified. A leader ought to be doing the work of a leader, but you are dumping all the work on me. Don’t you think that it’s unreasonable for you to demand that I submit to you? Ask these juniors here if they think that it makes sense at all!” Bai Yunqing exclaimed.

“It makes sense,” the Ancient Realm’s juniors replied in unison.

“You all… Damn it!” Bai Yunqing was rendered speechless. “Have you been brainwashed by him?!”

“Bai Yunqing, you think that I don’t have what it takes to be the leader of this team? Very well, I’ll prove myself to you. You have spent almost thirty minutes working on this formation now, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“What about it?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“I’ll try breaching it now. Let’s see if I can do it within thirty minutes,” Chu Feng replied as he walked up to the barrier.

“You? You’re dreaming! A mere White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist thinks that he can breach a formation that even a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist struggles with! Don’t you know the huge gap between each world spiritist rank?” Bai Yunqing sneered. 

The Ancient Realm’s junior agreed with Bai Yunqing too. 

“Chu Feng, I’ll submit to you and respect you as my big brother if you can breach this formation within two hour’s time, let alone thirty minutes!” Bai Yunqing declared.

“I’ll hold you to your promise,” Chu Feng replied.

“There are many people here who can testify to that. I won’t renege on my words,” Bai Yunqing replied confidently. He knew that there was no way Chu Feng could breach the formation.

Weng!

Chu Feng unleashed his spirit power, and within the time it took to wave his hand, he had already completed the deciphering formation. He channeled the deciphering formation into the wall before him. 

“This fellow!”

Bai Yunqing’s face paled the moment he saw Chu Feng construct the deciphering formation, and he swallowed down the down he had prepared to humiliate Chu Feng. Much to his shock, Chu Feng’s deciphering formation was much more ingenious than his. On top of that, he realized that the spirit power infused in Chu Feng’s formation was actually on par with his!

“This is impossible. This doesn’t make sense! He’s a mere White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist! How can he construct such a powerful formation?!”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Bai Yunqing couldn’t believe his eyes.
