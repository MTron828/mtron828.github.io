Chapter 3841 - Another Match

“Zhuanghong, this is that young master Asura you spoke of?”

The Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster did not pay any attention to the Mystic Cave Saints. Instead, she looked to Yin Zhuanghong.

She had to verify the matter.

Only through verification could she determine if Chu Feng was friend or foe.

“Master, that’s him.” After saying those words, Yin Zhuanghong deliberately pretended to be shocked as she asked Chu Feng, “Asura, how did you get here?”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng thought to himself, ‘Who would’ve expected that this girl actually knows how to play dumb?’

‘You clearly already knew that I’d come long ago, yet you’re asking me that sort of question. Quite the good show you’re putting on here.’

“Young master Asura, how did you arrive at this place?” The Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster also turned her gaze to Chu Feng.

“My apologies, Lady Headmaster. I heard that the Red-dress Holy Land had an important gamble today and, out of curiosity, decided to come and check it out.”

“However, as I was afraid of affecting you all with my presence, I decided to conceal myself with some abilities and snuck in here,” Chu Feng said with a clasped fist.

“Some abilities?”

“Young master Asura, you’re truly extraordinary. Your abilities actually managed to pull the wool over our eyes.” The elders of the Red-dress Holy Land said with smiles on their faces.

Chu Feng’s ability to conceal himself had already caused them to have a whole new level of respect for him.

“This Asura has come unsolicited. Seniors, please punish me for it.” Chu Feng clasped his fist respectfully and spoke with an apologetic expression. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Young master Asura is an important guest. If you want to come here, we will naturally not stop you from doing so. You’ve done nothing wrong at all." With a smile all over her face, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster expressed that she had no intention to blame Chu Feng for what he had done.

“Motherfucking hell! Damned brat, you actually dared to ignore us?! You’re fucking courting death!”

Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard. Then, an extremely powerful oppressive might rushed towards Chu Feng to attack him.

Chu Feng’s expression changed.

The person who had sent forth the oppressive might to attack him was the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.

It was unknown what sort of ability, he had used but he had removed the cape from his body.

Thus, he was able to use his martial power. That was the reason why he was able to send forth his oppressive might to attack Chu Feng.

His oppressive might was actually that of a peak Exalted.

Chu Feng did not expect that the Mystic Cave Saints would possess such powerful cultivations.

After all, although they were extremely shameless, they appeared very stupid, and did not resemble expert cultivators at all.

At the instant when Chu Feng was surprised, Eleventh’s oppressive might arrived before him.

“Woosh~~~”

However, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster waved her sleeve, and the oppressive might immediately vanished.

Even though that Eleventh might be a peak Exalted, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster was a rank three Utmost Exalted. Before her, that oppressive might was simply useless.

“Mystic Cave Saints, what nerve you all have! You actually dared to unleash an attack in our Red-dress Holy Land?!”

The Red-dress Holy Land’s elders all glared at the Mystic Cave Saints angrily.

“Humph. That brat robbed us of our treasures. What wrong is there in us teaching him a lesson?”

“Truly never would we have imagined that your Red-dress Holy Land is actually associated with such a shameless individual. It would appear that your Red-dress Holy Land is not some sort of upright place either," cursed the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Robbed?”

After hearing what the Mystic Cave Saints said, the Red-dress Holy Land’s crowd grew even more confused.

Although the Mystic Cave Saints had bad reputations, they were still rather famous people in the All-heaven Starfield.

How could they possibly be robbed by Chu Feng, a person of the younger generation?

Confused, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster turned to ask Chu Feng, “Young master Asura, you have a prior conflict with the Mystic Cave Saints?”

“Lady Headmaster, have you heard of there being cheaters that snuck their way into the Seven Suns Mountain Range’s World Spirit Mansion Gate to snatch the treasures from the younger generations a couple days ago?” asked Chu Feng.

“I’ve heard about that," said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Senior, those cheaters that snuck their way into the World Spirit Mansion Gate are eleven." Chu Feng pointed to the Mystic Cave Saints as he spoke.

“It’s actually them?”

The people from the Red-dress Holy Land all felt surprised to hear those words.

However, their surprise only lasted for a brief moment, and was replaced by absolute certainty.

The reason for their rapid change in opinions was due to their understanding of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“I believe that seniors all know that the treasures in the World Spirit Mansion Gate are treasures Grandmaster Yuan Shu prepared for the people of the younger generation.”

“The Mystic Cave Saints went against the rules by sneaking in there.”

“Because of that, this junior used some tricks, and snatched back the treasures they had obtained in the World Spirit Mansion Gate.”

“What I’ve done was upholding justice. It was no robbery at all," added Chu Feng.

“If that’s the case, young master Asura has truly done a good thing," said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“Humph! Brat, don’t you make false accusations!”

“That’s right. How could we, the Mystic Cave Saints, do such a shameless thing?”

The Mystic Cave Saints refused to admit to Chu Feng’s claims.

“I seem to recall that you Mystic Cave Saints have done a lot of shameless things?”

“Thinking back to your notorious behavior, I am more willing to believe in young master Asura’s claims," said the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster.

“You’re together to begin with, of course you’ll believe him.”

“Forget it, we won’t bother wasting time arguing with you all. Pay the bet you’ve lost and hand over the Spirit Formation Cultivation Bead,” said the Mystic Cave Saints’ Eldest.

“What’s this? You’re planning to run away after winning once? Do you dare to go another round against me?” said Chu Feng.
