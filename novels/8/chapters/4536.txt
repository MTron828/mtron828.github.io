Chapter 4536 - Return

“I never expect to see you all here either.”

“Speaking of it, senior, you mentioned that you’re coming here to take care of something? What might that matter be?” Chu Feng asked the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

Chu Feng was very respectful toward the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. But, respect was all there was. There was no fear present at all.

His attitude of ease made the crowd become even more aware that Chu Feng possessed an extraordinary relationship with the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Indeed, I came here to take care of business. I’ve heard that the Ancestral Martial Dragon City possesses a rather close relationship with you.

“Even when you became acquaintanced with Xiaoxiao, it was because you desire to help the Ancestral Martial Dragon City so that they can return to our Dragon Clan.

“But, at that time, Xiaoxiao was insensible and lacked insight. She ended up missing out on allowing outstanding clansmen like the Ancestral Martial Dragon City the chance to return to our clan.

“Because of that, she was regretting her decision back then and has been mentioning this matter to me, asking me whether or not I can allow the Ancestral Martial Dragon City to return to our Dragon Clan.

“Once I learned about this matter, I decided to personally set off to come here.

“I intended to personally invite our fellow clansmen back to our Dragon Clan,” The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng revealed a faint smile.

But, Long Daozhi, Long Ning and the others from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were all being overwhelmed with emotions. Their excitement exploded from within their bodies.

They were so overwhelmed with excitement that they began to shake uncontrollably.

There were even people among them that started crying tears of joy. It wasn’t that they wanted to cry. It’s just that they were simply unable to contain their emotions.

It was not only the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. The others nearby were also feeling completely astonished.

It was one thing to be allowed to return to the Dragon Clan. But, for the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief to personally come to invite them...

Moreover, all of this was due to Chu Feng. Chu Feng was the reason for the Ancestral Martial Dragon City to receive such honor.

Oh how enormous of a face was this?

The relationship Chu Feng had with the Dragon Clan was actually this close?

But, compared to the others, the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, from their Sectmaster to their elders and disciples, all have extremely ugly expressions. It was as if they were fed ten catties of dog shit.

Even though they’ve had a bad feeling the entire time, it was only now that they truly realize what sort of overwhelming calamity they’ve committed.

They originally thought Chu Feng to be a clown.

Now, they discovered that they were the actual clowns.

Most importantly, they discovered that the guards from the Dragon Clan had already surrounded them and were fiercely glaring at them.

Even the opportunity to escape had disappeared for them.

At this moment, the people of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, their Sectmaster included, all felt like they’ll die.

They finally realized why the Dragon Clan’s clansmen and especially Long Xiaoxiao would be that furious after hearing their narration of suffering at the hands of Chu Feng.

Turns out, they were not furious at Chu Feng. Instead, they were furious at them.

Indeed, they managed to ignite the desire to murder within the hearts of the Dragon Clansmen. But, that murderous desire was not aimed at Chu Feng. Instead, it was aimed toward them.

“You damned trash! It’s all your fault that our sect’s going to perish!”

The Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster glared maliciously at a female disciple standing behind him.

It was the female disciple that provoked Chu Feng initially.

If it wasn’t for her, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect wouldn’t end up like this.

As for that female disciple, she was already covered in tears of fear. She also knew that she was the cause of today’s calamity.

But, she was only the fuse that ignited the situation. The true culprit that brought about this calamity was the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster himself.

If he didn’t try to force things to the extreme, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect wouldn’t end up this way.

Unfortunately, it was already too late for him to regret things now.

All of them had their movements restricted by the Dragon Clan’s experts. They do not even possess the means to attempt to explain things to the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. The only thing they could do right now was to kneel on the ground like prisoners and wait for their sentencing.

“Long Daozhi, are you willing to bring your clansmen and return to our Dragon Clan?” The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked Long Daozhi.

“I am. Lord Clan Chief, this subordinate is willing.”

Long Daozhi was overwhelmed with emotions. He was wiping his cheeks as he spoke.

Even though he was the grand City Master of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, he was still unable to stop himself from shedding emotional tears.

But, no one was ridiculing his behavior. Instead, they all understood it very well. This was especially true for the others of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. They all knew very well what their Lord City Master was going through right now.

To return to the Dragon Clan was the dream of their Ancestral Martial Dragon City, it was a dream since the time of their forefathers.

“Very good. Long Daozhi, hear my order. I will now confer you the title of our Dragon Clan’s Law Enforcement Elder. You are to be in charge of managing our Dragon Clan’s Martial Skill Pavilion.”

“From today on, all the people from your Ancestral Martial Dragon City will return to being members of our Dragon Clan.”

“Upon their return, they will all enjoy the proper treatment that all Dragon Clansmen should possess.”

After saying those words, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief waved his sleeve.

Then, several people walked out uniformly from the Dragon Clan’s army behind.

Standing in midair, they appeared very solemn yet graceful. They were all carrying chests.

They walked into the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City and began to distribute the contents of those chests to them.

Once the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City received the contents of those chests, even those that managed to keep their composure before, those that managed to not cry earlier, had their eyes turning red.

The reason for that was because what was given to them by the Dragon Clansmen was something that they yearned for day and night -- the Dragon Clan’s title plate!!!

It was not only the symbol of being Dragon Clansmen.

To them, those title plates were the dream that their ancestors all wanted to realize. It was an honor that no other object could replace.

They... really managed to return to the Dragon Clan!!!

“Lord Clan Chief, this subordinate’s status is truly low. I’m afraid that I am not qualified to take on such an important position.”

Even though Long Daozhi was feeling very excited about the offer, he was not confident.

A Law Enforcement Elder of the Dragon Clan’s Martial Skills Pavilion?

That was a position qualified to be held by only peak Utmost Exalted level existences.

“I said that you’re up for the task. Thus, you are up for the task.”

“Besides that, I can tell that the people from your Ancestral Martial Dragon City have grown used to following you. It might be difficult for them to become accustomed to things should they be allocated to other departments.”

“As such, once you all return to the Dragon Clan, the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City shall proceed to the Martial Skills Pavilion together with you. They will remain your subordinates.”

“Apart from that, as your Ancestral Martial Dragon City had protected young friend Chu Feng before, this title plate is my reward to you.”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief personally took out a golden title plate and handed it to Long Daozhi.

Seeing that title plate, the crowd, even many from the Dragon Clan itself, all felt envious of Long Daozhi.

That was no ordinary title plate. It was a death exemption title plate.

With that tiel plate, even if Long Daozhi was to commit some sort of grievous crime, he will be able to escape the punishment of death one time.

“Lord Clan Chief, I... This subordinate had done nothing to be worthy of such generosity.”

Even though Long Daozhi was so overjoyed that his eyes were brimming with tears of excitement, he did not dare to accept the title plate.

Being allowed to return to the Dragon Clan was already something that surpassed his expectations. He never expected that he would be able to receive this sort of generosity from the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“You are wholly qualified to receive this,” said the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief with a smile. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Senior Long, you should accept it. You couldn’t possibly be intending to have my father keep holding it, right?” said Long Xiaoxiao with a smile on her face.

Compared to the time when she first met Long Daozhi, her attitude toward Long Daozhi grew much friendlier.

“Thank you Lord Clan Chief.”

Hearing those words from Long Xiaoxiao, Long Daozhi immediately accepted the death exemption title plate.

After he accepted the title plate, he couldn’t help but glance at Chu Feng.

He knew that he, Long Daozhi, was not the reason for all this.

All of this was bestowed to him and his Ancestral Martial Dragon City by Chu Feng.

It was Chu Feng who accomplished the dreams of his forefathers.

It was not only Long Daozhi that was looking at Chu Feng.

All the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were looking at Chu Feng.

Especially Long Ning, complicated emotions filled her eyes.

The things Chu Feng said to her earlier had thoroughly enraged her.

But, recalling his words now, Chu Feng was not deceiving her at all. Rather, he was telling her the truth.

It wasn’t Chu Feng that was foolish. Rather, she was the foolish one. Even though she was clearly his friend, she failed to discover that he had become this powerful already.

He became so strong that... even a colossus like the Dragon Clan would be so friendly toward him.

It was no wonder that Chu Feng would not place the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect in his eyes.

With the Dragon Clan as his backing, not to mention a mere Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, very few powers in the entire Holy Light Galaxy would dare to touch Chu Feng.

“Little benefactor, it seems to me that these people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect had offended you, no?”

Suddenly, Long Xiaoxiao turned her gaze to the crowd from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.

Once Long Xiaoxiao said those words, the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect all started shivering.

Finally, they’re going to face the consequences of their actions!!!
