Chapter 3993 - The Cunning Demon Fox

“Young master, what do you mean by that?”

“A’li doesn’t understand.”

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, A’li looked to him innocently.

“Don’t understand?”

Chu Feng smiled. He walked and began to fiddle with the sacred key in his hand.

A’li’s gaze followed him and the sacred key that was being flicked around in his hand repeatedly.

It could be seen that she deeply longed for the key.

She appeared very restless, and was itching to snatch the key from Chu Feng’s hand.

However, she did not do so. Instead, she stared at the key covetingly.

She looked slightly laughable, and slightly pitiful.

“Young master, I truly do not understand what you’re implying.”

“If young master is unwilling to release A’li from this place, A’li is willing to follow young master and recognize him as A’li’s master,” she said.

“I don’t need you to follow me,” said Chu Feng.

“Then could young master release me?” asked A’li.

“Release you? That’s not an issue at all.”

“Once you hand over this place’s treasure, I will release you.”

Chu Feng suddenly stopped and stared at that A’li.

“Treasure?”

“Young master, I am the treasure of this place,” said A’li.

“If that’s the case, I’ll be leaving.”

“Since young lady has stayed in this place for all these years, you shouldn’t mind continuing to wait.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he turned around and began walking out.

“Young master, please wait.”

A’li started to panic upon seeing that. She immediately extended her hand and grabbed Chu Feng’s clothes.

When Chu Feng turned around, A’li was actually kneeling before him.

“A’li was wrong. A’li shouldn’t have attempted to fool young master.”

“It’s just that the treasure of this place has been accompanying me since the moment I woke up.”

“I no longer remember how long I’ve been in this place. All this time, there has not been anyone accompanying me.”

“They were the only ones accompanying me.”

“To me, they are all beings with a spiritual nature. They are all my friends.”

“How could I possibly give my friends to someone else?” A’li said with a look of pain.

Her eyes were actually dripping with tears as she said those words.

Her grievance-filled look was truly a painful sight to bear.

“You said you’ve been here all by yourself for many years, and ended up considering the treasures of this place to be your friends. That I can understand.”

“However, the important matter is that they did not belong to you to begin with.”

“Those treasures should belong to me now.”

“Regardless of what your justification is, you should not appropriate things to yourself that rightfully belong to others.”

“You should be handing them over to me. That is the mission that the master of this place gave you,” said Chu Feng.

“Yes, young master is correct.”

“A’li is slow-witted. I didn’t understand young master earlier.”

“After hearing what young master said, A’li finally came to a realization.”

“Young master, I’ll hand all of these to you.”

As A’li spoke, she placed her hand into her bosom and took out dozens of items in succession.

This completely stupefied Chu Feng.

It would be one thing if those items were all relatively small.

However, among them was an enormous cauldron over a dozen meters in height.

In the blink of an eye, the room was covered in items.

From this, Chu Feng could imagine that the insides of A’li’s long skirt contained some sort of treasure akin to a Cosmos Sack. Otherwise, how could she conceal all those treasures?

Among the treasures were fans, bottle gourds, bowls and a sword composed of woven coins.

However, not a single one of them was a weapon. They were all treasures with special powers.

Every single one could be said to be invaluable. Most importantly, the great majority of them emitted the Ancient Era’s aura.

Most of the treasures from the Ancient Era were completely tattered.

Yet, those treasures were like new. Chu Feng could tell that they had been very well-maintained.

However, at the same time, he felt somewhat strange.

The fox spirit emitted the Ancient Era’s aura from her body. This meant that she was a monster that had existed since the Ancient Era.

She was not someone that had appeared after the Ancient Era. Rather, she was someone who had lived in the Ancient Era. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Logically, the stone case should also be from the Ancient Era.

However, it just so happened that the treasures that this fox spirit took out, although they were all invaluable, not all of them emitted an Ancient Era’s aura.

A portion of them did not possess the Ancient Era’s aura.

This meant that some of those treasures were not from the Ancient Era.

But, they should all be treasures from the Ancient Era.

Because of this, Chu Feng was momentarily confused.

He felt that the situation was rather strange and fishy.

“Young master, you must treat my friends well,” said A’li.

“Young lady, there’s still the most important item that you’ve yet to hand over.”

“Once you hand that over, I will release you,” said Chu Feng.

“There’s no more. Young master, I’ve truly taken out all the treasures. If you don’t believe me, you can search me,” A’li said with a serious expression.

“You’re making things difficult for me here. We’re of different sexes, how could I possibly search young lady’s body?” Chu Feng shook his head.

“In that case, young master does not have to do the searching. You can look instead.”

As A’li spoke, she actually removed her long skirt.

Chu Feng did not avoid her body. Just like that, he stared at her.

The reason why he was so determined that A’li still had a treasure on her was because of his Heaven’s Eyes.

Although Chu Feng was unable to see through A’li’s long skirt, he could see that she still had a hidden aura on her body. It was a treasure’s aura.

After A’li took off her long skirt and stood before Chu Feng completely naked, Chu Feng gasped with surprise.

He was shocked to discover that A’li not only had a beautiful face, but she also had beautiful curves.

That said, he was also somewhat puzzled. Even though A’li had clearly removed her clothes, even though there was nothing on her anymore, Chu Feng was still able to see the aura of a treasure with his Heaven’s Eyes.

‘Could it be that she’s hiding it within her body?’

With this thought in his mind, Chu Feng began to examine her with his Heaven’s Eyes. He wanted to see through her flesh and into her internal organs.

However, it just so happened that Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes were unable to see through A’li’s skin.

One should know that Chu Feng, even without using his Heaven’s Eyes, could see through ordinary objects with his eyes.

The penetration ability of his Heaven’s Eyes was extremely powerful. Many treasures were unable to obstruct Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes.

Yet, it just so happened that he was unable to see through A’li’s skin.

This made Chu Feng realize that it was not only the removed long skirt that was extraordinary; this fox spirit before him herself was extraordinary.

At the moment when Chu Feng was seriously examining A’li’s body, A’li’s voice sounded, “Young master, how much longer are you going to look?”

“Didn’t you say that you’re not fond of women?”

“Since you don’t like women, why is your body...”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng immediately coughed a couple times. Then, he turned around to conceal his embarrassment.

Chu Feng knew what A’li was talking about.

After all, he was a man, and a normal man on top of that. As for A’li, she was such a beautiful young woman.

As such, Chu Feng gave off a very normal reaction. Merely, he had not expected A’li to discover his reaction.

Sure enough, a fox spirit was different. Even something like that was discovered by her.

“Young lady, go ahead and get dressed,” said Chu Feng.

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, A’li actually and immediately put her long skirt back on.

“Young master, do you believe A’li now?” A’li asked as she looked at Chu Feng with a blushing face.
