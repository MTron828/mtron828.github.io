MGA: Chapter 1245 - The Strongest Disciple, Qin Lingyun

The black gaseous flames covered the sky, turning the bright sky into one of murky darkness.

Not only were the gaseous flames extremely dark, their forms were also changing nonstop, as if they were living things; it was truly imposing.

If one was to observe carefully, one would even see a pair of empty eyes on the vast horizon. It was truly frightening.[1. I’m assuming the black gases cover the entire sky but there are two holes that appear like eyes.]

Those black gaseous flames were truly frightening, so frightening that many disciples with a lower cultivation did not even dare to look at them. However, even though they had closed their eyes so as not to look at it, they were still trembling in fear.

One must know that the most frightening thing about the black gaseous flames was not its form. Instead, it was its frightening aura.

That aura was able to enter their organs and penetrate deep into their souls. Not to mention that the aura was able to cause their hearts to tremble, it was even able to cause them to have hallucinations, and to start hearing the wails of ghosts and the howls of wolves.

At this moment, Eggy’s long, beautiful black hair was fluttering in the wind, and her exceptionally beautiful pair of eyes had turned crimson in color.

She slowly spread open her arms, and then the entire sky changed color.

She was the Queen, the Murderous Queen from the depths of darkness.

“To-to-too frightening! What sort of power is this? She’s merely a rank five Martial King, how could she have a power this frightening?!”

“Is this the legendary Asura World Spirit? How could there be such a frightening World Spirit in this world?!!!”

At this moment, chaos filled the sky above the Asura Division. Practically all of the disciples had been frightened by Eggy’s might. How could they even dare to mock and laugh at Chu Feng anymore? They were so scared that they began to step back repeatedly and wanted to flee from the Asura Division’s territory.

Even demon-level geniuses like Tao Xiangyu, Zhao Jingang and Qi Yanyu were no exception; they were also filled with fear and unease like everyone else.

At this moment, only a single person remained relatively calm. As for that person, he was the second head of the Heaven Inquiring Division, rank eight Martial King Bai Yunxiao.

However, he did not take the initiative to attack. After all, the aura emitted by Eggy was simply too powerful and, even he did not know for certain whether or not he would be able to defeat her. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

If he was able to defeat her, then everything would be fine, as it was something that should happen. After all, he was one of the top geniuses of the Cyanwood Mountain.

However, if he were to be defeated by Eggy, then he would’ve truly humiliated himself beyond comparison. After all, he was a rank eight Martial King, whereas Eggy was a rank five Martial King.

At this moment, Bai Yunxiao had no choice but to admit that he was a bit regretful in getting involved with this mess, as he was now stuck between a rock and a hard place, and could neither fight nor retreat.

As even someone as powerful as Bai Yunxiao was regretting, there was less of a need to mention the others. This was especially true for the members of the Beast King Division; each and every one of them were panicking to the extreme.

Each and every one of them were monstrous beasts. Thus, flowing within their blood was the bravery of beasts. As such, they were very blood-thirsty warlike daredevils that did not fear anything.

However, when their two heads were both defeated by Eggy with a single strike, how could they continue to exhibit their fearless bravery? Each and every one of them were already so scared that they pissed their pants in terror.

“Huu~~~~~~~~~~~~”

Right at the moment when everyone was frightened by Eggy’s might, a frantic hurricane rose from the southern horizon.

The sound of that frantic hurricane was like the bellow of a beast. The size of the hurricane was so enormous that it actually covered both the sky and the earth.

However, this enormous hurricane did not bring any harm to things or objects. Instead, it only blew away Eggy’s black gaseous flames. It was as if the hurricane had come just for the purpose of suppressing Eggy’s might.

The speed of that hurricane was extremely fast, and it arrived in front of everyone in no time at all. At the moment when it stopped moving, Eggy’s black gaseous flames had been completely dispersed.

“This is?”

After that hurricane suppressed Eggy’s might, it also dissipated into thin air. At this moment, a man appeared before the crowd.

It was a middle-aged man. He wore a green gown, and had the disciple’s green hat on his head. His outfit was exactly that of a Cyanwood Mountain’s core disciple. However, his aura was extraordinary and definitely not something that other disciples could compare with.

This man was over two meters tall. Not only was he both tall and robust, he also had a pair of sharp eyes and green pupils on top of that. At this moment, he was sweeping his strange and frightening eyes over the crowd, causing all of them to feel fear.

“Qin Lingyun.” Finally, someone cried out in alarm. Immediately following that, everyone sucked in a mouthful of cold air and reverence filled their gazes.

“He’s Qin Lingyun?” At this moment, Chu Feng also started to frown, and began to earnestly size up the man in the distance.

Qin Lingyun was the head of Lingyun’s Division, and ranked second on the Cyanwood Succession List. At the same time, he was also a member of the Punishment Department.

Even though Qin Lingyun was ranked second on the Cyanwood Succession List, he had actually fought with Qin Mowen, the ranked first on the Cyanwood Succession List, to a tie many times.

The reason why Qin Mowen was ranked first was because he was older than Qin Lingyun and his Heaven Inquiring Division was stronger than Qin Lingyun’s Lingyun’s Division. When considering their overall strength, Qin Mowon surpassed Qin Lingyun. Thus, Qin Mowen was deemed to be the strongest existence on the Cyanwood Succession List.

However, in terms of personal strength, Qin Lingyun’s strength was on par with Qin Mowen’s, and he fully deserved to be known as the number one genius on the Cyanwood Succession List, the strongest disciple.

“This is great. I truly never imagined that senior brother Qin would come too.”

“Humph. Senior brother Qin is invincible. We shall see how this Chu Feng can continue to act so arrogant.”

When they saw Qin Lingyun, Tao Xiangyu and the others were overjoyed. Even though Qin Lingyun was a very proud and aloof individual, he was, after all, a member of the Punishment Department. Since he had come, he had most likely done so to stand up for Tao Xiangyu.

And since Qin Lingyun had shown himself, they firmly believed that Chu Feng would be undoubtedly defeated. Just from Qin Lingyun being able to surpass Eggy’s might earlier, it was enough to show the crowd that he was extremely powerful.

“Chu Feng, what cultivation does this Qin Lingyun have?” Eggy secretly asked Chu Feng.

“He has a treasure on him that is blocking me from seeing his cultivation. However, he is most definitely stronger than Bai Yunxiao. Eggy, do you have the confidence of being able to win against him?” Chu Feng knew that he was definitely not a match for Qin Lingyun. Thus, he could only place all of his hopes on Eggy.

“If we were of the same cultivation, then even if there were ten thousand Qin Lingyuns, they would not be a match for this queen. However, the disparity between our cultivations is too great. I fear that I am greatly inferior to him,” Eggy shook her head. Even though she was very unwilling, she had no choice but to admit that Qin Lingyun was truly too powerful, and that she felt no confidence in being able to win against him.

After he heard what Eggy said, Chu Feng started to frown even tighter. Earlier, when Bai Yunxiao and the others came, even though Chu Feng did not have absolute confidence that he would be able to win, he was still somewhat confident with Her Lady Queen beside him.

Yet now, the situation was completely different. After Qin Lingyun appeared, the situation had shifted completely. They simply did not have the ability to stand against Qin Lingyun at all.

“Senior brother Qin, that Chu Feng is truly too daring. For no reason or cause, he injured our junior sister Tao.”

“Especially that world spirit. She is truly undisciplined and out of control; she actually publicly slapped junior sister Tao and ruined her beautiful face.”

“We have come here for the sake of making that Chu Feng apologize to junior sister Tao. Yet, he refuses to accept reason. Not only did he refuse to apologize, he even insulted and attacked us.”

“Has there ever been a new disciple like him? We have simply never even heard of a disciple like him. He truly does not put seniors before his eyes!”

“Senior brother Qin, you’ve come at the perfect time. You really should teach him a lesson so that he can learn to conduct himself properly in our Cyanwood Mountain.”

At this moment, Bai Yunxiao, Zhao Jingan, Tao Xiangyu, and Qi Yanyu all flew to Qin Lingyun’s side and began to shamelessly invert right from wrong and place all the fault on Chu Feng.

However, to everyone’s surprise, Qin Lingyun ignored them completely, and also ignored Chu Feng. Instead, he turned his gaze to Bai Ruochen and asked, “You have an Imperial Bloodline?”
