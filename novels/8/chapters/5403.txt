Chapter 5403: Deserve to Die a Thousand Times Over

Jie Zhou also thought that Lord Nianqing was going to stand up for him, which was why he further embellished the story to besmirch Chu Feng, making him out to be the villain.

Lord Nianqing frowned. While she knew that Chu Feng was her grandson, she didn’t know what kind of person he was. Nevertheless, she could hardly curb the rage blazing in her heart when she learned that her grandson had suffered grievances.

She owed Chu Feng so much that she felt obliged to protect him even if he was a person of poor character. As a result, the atmosphere turned even colder. No one dared to utter a word, fearing that they would be implicated in her wrath.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sheng’er!”

Yet, Ling Mo’er and Ling Sheng’er kicked up a fuss at this critical moment. It looked like the two of them had an argument, and Ling Mo’er was trying to hold Ling Sheng’er back.

“Let me go! I have to tell the truth!” Ling Sheng’er shouted. She tossed Ling Mo’er aside before dashing up to Lord Nianqing. “Lord Nianqing, he’s lying!”

“Audacious! Ling Sheng’er, how dare you act so preposterously before Lord Nianqing?”

Shuang Yu’s eyes turned cold. She knew what Ling Sheng’er was going to say, so she exerted her oppressive might with the intent to stop her from running her mouth.

Uwa!

But before Shuang Yu could succeed, she was suddenly sent tumbling across the air. When she finally regained her balance, she looked at Lord Nianqing in disbelief, knowing that the latter was the one who attacked her. She couldn’t understand why Lord Nianqing was treating her in such a manner.

Despite her indignance, Lord Nianqing’s face remained icy. She glared at Shuang Yu with cold eyes and questioned, “Are you trying to call the shots here?”

“I wouldn’t dare, milord!”

Shuang Yu had prepared a script to accuse Ling Sheng’er of colluding with Chu Feng, but she dared not to say a word under such an atmosphere. She could tell that Lord Nianqing was angry at her, but she couldn’t understand why that was the case.

“Ling Sheng’er, why did you say that Jie Zhou was lying?” Lord Nianqing asked with a cold face.

Those in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion knew how much Lord Nianqing doted on Jie Zhou, which made speaking up against Jie Zhou before Lord Nianqing an utterly foolish move.

Even Ling Sheng’er was intimidated as well. However, she was still determined to say her piece.

“Yes, Lord Nianqing. Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing haven’t done anything wrong. Jie Zhou was the one who colluded with Shuang Yu to frame the two of them!”

It was a leap of faith for Ling Sheng’er. She knew deep well that standing up against Jie Zhou right now would likely only incur Lord Nianqing’s ire, but she couldn’t bear to watch Chu Feng shuddering such grievances. Even with the odds stacked against her, she was determined to voice the truth.

Lord Nianqing’s face turned even more livid upon learning the truth. Her killing intent silently seeped out, causing the world to tremble at her wrath. The crowd was intimidated.

Ling Mo’er anxiously bit her lips as tears flowed from her eyes. She knew that her worries had come true. She knew that Lord Nianqing would side with Jie Zhou over her little sister, which was why she had tried her best to stop Ling Sheng’er earlier.

Ling Sheng’er also thought that she had failed, so she closed her eyes and awaited her punishment.

In contrast, Jie Zhou smiled gleefully as he gazed at Ling Sheng’er with a triumphant look.

Just then, a person descended from the sky. It was the elder in charge of guarding the training tower.

“Lord Nianqing, I can vouch that Ling Sheng’er isn’t lying.”

He thought that Lord Nianqing was going to punish Ling Sheng’er, and that could lead to severe repercussions. To avoid that, he had no choice but to divulge the truth.

However, Jie Zhou immediately pointed a finger at the elder and exclaimed, “You… You actually colluded with Chu Feng too? Speak! What did he promise you? How dare you betray the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?!”

Boom!

There was a sudden loud explosion. Countless cracks appeared on the land.

The crowd was taken aback.

Jie Zhou had been crushed deep into the ground by powerful spirit power. That was also how the cracks had come to be. However, what was truly shocking was that the spirit power that had thrust him into the ground came from none other than Lord Nianqing!

How could Lord Nianqing injure Jie Zhou when he was the person whom she doted on the most? What could have prompted her to make such a move?

Shuang Yu panicked. She knew that she would be punished too if Lord Nianqing decided to believe Ling Sheng’er and the others. Thus, she broke her silence and said, “Milord, you can’t buy into their words! They…”

“Shut your mouth,” Lord Nianqing bellowed. She pointed at the elder guarding the training tower and said, “He would never lie to me. I was the one who stationed him here to keep an eye on all of you.”

Shuang Yu collapsed to the ground. She didn’t think that Lord Nianqing would actually send someone to keep an eye on them. There was no point arguing anymore if that was the case, as the elder guarding the training tower must be someone whom Lord Nianqing trusted deeply.

“Shuang Xue, imprison Shuang Yu and Jie Zhou in Hell’s Cage. No one is to let them out without my orders,” Lord Nianqing ordered.

Shuang Yu despaired, knowing how terrifying Hell’s Cage was. While it was true that they had lied, she couldn’t believe that Lord Nianqing had sentenced them to such a harsh punishment over a mere outsider.

Ling Sheng’er, Jie Yu, and the others were taken aback too. They found the situation hard to believe.

“Understood.”

Shuang Xue, despite being Shuang Yu’s older sister, didn’t plead on her behalf at all. She took out a set of chains and bound Shuang Yu and Jie Zhou before taking them to Hell’s Cage.

“Big sister, what’s going on? Why did Lord Nianqing flare up? Did she encounter something while deciphering the formation?” Shuang Yu couldn’t believe that Lord Nianqing would flare up over Chu Feng, so she deduced that Lord Nianqing had encountered something that infuriated her in the formation.

Shuang Xue shook her head and said, “You only have yourself to blame. You went overboard.”

“Big sister, I know that I went overboard, but it was all for young master Jie Zhou! Chu Feng stole young master Jie Zhou’s limelight. I had no choice but to help him because I know how much Lord Nianqing dotes on him! Big sister, you should know how loyal I am to Lord Nianqing. Please speak up on my behalf once Lord Nianqing’s anger cools down.” Shuang Yu begged her older sister, knowing that the latter would leave her to the lurch.

“It’s useless. You have to pay the price.”

Yet, Shuang Xue’s attitude remained cold.

“Why?! I know that we have done wrong, but we don’t deserve this!” Shuang Yu cried out.

“You deserve this very much!” Shuang Xue roared at her.

Shuang Yu was taken aback by Shuang Xue’s outburst.

“Do you know who Chu Feng is? I’ll tell you. He’s our young miss’ child, Lord Nianqing’s grandson!” Unable to stand it anymore, Shuang Xue revealed the truth.

“What?” Shuang Yu froze up as if she had been struck by a bolt of lightning. “Big sister, you must be pulling my leg. How could Chu Feng be our little young master? Isn’t our little young master already dead?”

She thought that this was too ridiculous to be true.

“Lord Nianqing has already met Chu Feng and confirmed that he is our young miss’ child. Do you know what you have done now?” Shuang Xue roared.

Putong!

Shuang Yu fell to her knees. Her spirit withered within a matter of seconds. If Chu Feng was truly their little young master, this punishment wasn’t overboard at all. She wouldn’t be able to redeem herself even if she died a thousand times over!
