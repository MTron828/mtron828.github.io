Chapter 5847: A Strong Opponent

Chapter 5847: A Strong Opponent

Loud rumbles echoed under the vast starry sky. The black light pillar that had pierced through the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation had begun receding from the realm.

However, Chu Feng could sense a fundamental change in the black light pillar that left him feeling greatly threatened. He deduced that the black light pillar would recede to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation and morph into a unique spirit formation gate.

At the same time, the restrictions imposed on the black light pillar would change from age to cultivation.

Previously, the black light pillar only transported juniors across the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation, but now, it would transport anyone beneath a certain cultivation level... and this cultivation cap was swiftly increasing.

When Chu Feng first sensed this change, the cultivation cap was Spirit Martial, but it swiftly rose through Origin Martial, Profound Martial, and Heaven Martial to reach Martial Lord. Even though the cultivation cap was still low at the moment, things could get dangerous very soon.

Putting aside the six Ancient Era’s clans Heavenly God level cultivators, it would already be devastating if they slipped a True God level cultivator across the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation.

While Chu Feng could deal with rank one True God level cultivators, anything higher was beyond his means.

Things unfolded the way Chu Feng expected. The black light pillar stopped receding upon reaching the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation. On top of that, a unique spirit formation gate appeared on it.

Without a doubt, the six Ancient Era’s clans would start dispatching their clansmen once the spirit formation gate’s cultivation cap reached Half-God level. A massacre would ensue.

And the moment the spirit formation gate’s cultivation cap reached True God level, the protective formation would be rendered useless. No one in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy would be able to stop the Ancient Era’s clans anymore. It would be the end of them.

Fortunately, Chu Feng had figured out a way to control the protective formation, and he began channeling the protective formation’s energy to attack the spirit formation gate to restrict it. However, that only slowed the increment rate of the spirit formation gate’s cultivation cap.

This was not enough to stop them.

Chu Feng had to find a method to stop the spirit formation gate for good.

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, you are going all out to bring down our Ancestral Martial Galaxy.”

Chu Feng hadn’t seen the true form of the enemy’s formation and had no idea how it was operated, but he could imagine how much precious treasures had to be depleted to circumvent the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s protective formation. Most of these treasures might even be extinct in the present era.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was paying a hefty price here. Yet, Jie Tianran still went through with it.

“Very well, Jie Tianran. Let’s see how many treasures you’re willing to deplete here,” Chu Feng sneered.

He was convinced Puppeteer Exalted was Jie Tianran. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had the means to collude with the Ancient Era’s clans, and he had the motive to attack the Ancestral Martial Galaxy too.

Meanwhile, inside the formation realm where the Ancient Era’s clans were...

“Slow down, Puppeteer Exalted! Are you trying to deplete all our bloodline powers?” the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief roared.

His strained face showed just how much pain he was facing. It was the same for the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master and the others; their old faces were twitching too. They had weathered many storms and had surmounted many difficulties, but the pain they were currently put under was still unbearable to them.

“Slow down, Puppeteer Exalted. Otherwise, it’ll be difficult for us to make a recovery if we expend too much of our bloodline powers,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master, who had shown the greatest support to Puppeteer Exalted thus far, said.

Other than their martial power and spirit power, this formation depleted their bloodline powers too. Their bloodline powers were the foundation of their cultivation, and it could cap their future progress if too much of their bloodline powers were expended.

That was the last thing they would want. Even so, they still gave in for the sake of this operation.

Initially, their bloodlines and energies were still being depleted at an acceptable rate, but the rate suddenly spiked, reaching an unbearable level for them.

“There’s an expert in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. My guess is that Chu Feng has returned. He’s likely operating the formation core now. We wouldn’t have to resort to this if only your top prodigies had taken down the formation core. There’s no choice. We have to make a swift and decisive move here, or else this operation will end in defeat,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

“Chu Feng? Are you joking with us, Puppeteer Exalted? He’s a junior! How can he have the power to oppose us?” the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief roared.

“The Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation is superior to the one we are channeling here. We would have nothing to fear if we were up against the weaklings from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, as they are incapable of drawing out the full prowess of the protective formation.

“However, Chu Feng is a highly talented world spiritist. He might be weak, but he can still hinder us through the protective formation. Whether you believe it or not, that is what’s happening right now. I concede this is an oversight on my part. I underestimated Chu Feng. As an apology, I’ll hand over half of my share of the treasure to be split among the six of you.

“I humbly beseech you to bear with it. As long as I have your cooperation, I’ll swiftly breach the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation so that we can get to the treasures. I assure you that the foundation of your bloodline powers won’t be tarnished,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders privately discussed this matter among themselves, and they soon arrived at a consensus.

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master was the one to relay their verdict. “Puppeteer Exalted, we have worked together for many years now. We trust you. Even so, you should take responsibility for your oversight. We’ll take half of your share, but we’ll cooperate with you given your sincerity. However, we expect you to hold your promise. Don’t blame us for getting nasty if you fail to breach the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation despite our cooperation.”

Puppeteer Exalted laughed confidently. “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely breach the formation today.”

The formation immediately intensified, prompting the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders to clench their jaws. With the cooperation of the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders, the Puppeteer Exalted’s formation strengthened.

At the same time, Chu Feng’s restriction on it weakened.

“Slow down, slow down!”

Chu Feng was panicking. There were rare beads of cold sweat on his face. He had found a way to curb the spirit formation gate and stop it from raising the cultivation cap, but he needed some time to implement the solution.

However, the spirit formation gate’s cultivation cap suddenly began rising at a rapid pace, to the point where he wasn’t sure whether he could make it in time. He had to admit that his opponent was formidable this time around, so much so that he wasn’t confident of winning.
