Chapter 5460: Wait For Him to Knock

The attacks directed at the Descent of the Demon Exalted finally stopped. Chu Feng looked at it and asked, “Tell me more about the scheme.”

“I don’t know what the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s true goal is, but he’s able to determine your location through me as I was forged out of his powers. However, he is only able to do that as long as I don’t fuse with you. Once I fuse with you, he’ll lose his connection with me.

“Chu Feng, I have been with you through your journey. I know that you are destined for great things. I would have been more than willing to offer you my strength, but I can’t do so. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted has planted a restriction on me that ensures my destruction should I fuse together with you,” the Descent of the Demon Exalted said.

Chu Feng frowned. He hadn’t thought that there would be such a reason behind the Descent of the Demon Exalted’s refusal to submit to him. It turned out that the wily old Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was using his secret skill as a position talisman!

However, Chu Feng wasn’t worried about himself but Wang Qiang.

He had known right from the start that something was off about the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, but he couldn’t do anything about it as the latter was simply too strong for them to deal with.

The Blood-devouring Blood Exalted was clearly out to kill him while they were vying for the Sacred Tree’s power, but he suddenly stopped halfway through and claimed that it was just a test. Now that Chu Feng thought about it, the Blood-devouring Blood Exalted might have sensed the protective formation inside him and realized that he couldn’t kill him, so he left such a hand inside him instead.

After all, it was through the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted that he first learned about the formation inside him and the sealing of the Evil God Sword.

Perhaps, it was not that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted didn’t want to steal the Sacred Tree’s powers from him but that he was unable to. Unwilling to give up, he decided to impart a secret skill to track Chu Feng in case an opportunity arose in the future.

“What else do you know? Continue speaking,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s all I know,” the Descent of the Demon God said.

Chu Feng flicked his finger, and the chains that had already impaled the Descent of the Demon God began furiously moving.

The Descent of the Demon God clenched his teeth in pain. “I really don’t know anything else! My memories are blurry. I don’t remember anything from the Ancient Era! All I know is that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted created me and is able to locate me through my aura! He warned me not to fuse with you or else I’ll be destroyed, but I don’t know his true motive. However, I suspect that it has something to do with the Void Sacred Tree’s powers.”

“What kind of powers does the Void Sacred Tree have?” Chu Feng asked.

The Void Sacred Tree had transformed into a little girl and entered Chu Feng’s body. He knew that the little girl was extremely powerful, but he hadn’t enjoyed any benefits from her to this day. In fact, he hadn’t even been able to refine and assimilate the Sacred Tree Seed to this day.

“The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted should have told you how powerful the Void Sacred Tree is. It’s a power that all cultivators dream of, or else the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted wouldn’t have desired it so much. Chu Feng, it’ll be best for you not to tell anyone about the Void Sacred Tree, or else it might spell your death. Other than that, I don’t know anything at all,” the Descent of the Demon Exalted said.

“What about Wang Qiang? What does the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted plan to do with him? Does he plan to possess Wang Qiang’s body?” Chu Feng asked.

His greatest worry was that Wang Qiang was in danger.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had said that he needed a vessel to survive, and he chose to inhabit Wang Qiang’s body because he possessed the Four Fiends Divine Body. He promised to help Wang Qiang along the way and leave his body once he regained his freedom.

However, it was hard to imagine the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted to be that kind-hearted. Chu Feng suspected that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was out to steal Wang Qiang’s Four Fiends Divine Body.

“I really don’t know anything at all, Chu Feng. I was previously sealed by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, so I don’t know his true intentions. Just think about it! There’s no way that wily old fox would dare transfer me into your body if I know his secrets, right? I am nothing but his pawn! I’m begging you, you have to trust me! I only refused to submit to you because I want to live!” The Descent of the Demon Exalted burst into tears.

It knew that Chu Feng possessed the power to kill it, but it didn’t want to die.

“Are you able to communicate with the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted?” Chu Feng asked.

“I can’t, though I might be able to sense the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted if he appears in the vicinity. The connection only goes one way,” the Descent of the Demon Exalted said.

“I’ll trust you for now, but know that I’ll make you die a painful death if I learn that you have been lying to me!” Chu Feng sneered.

The black aura finally receded into Chu Feng’s body together with the Descent of the Demon Exalted.

“Chu Feng, why didn’t you force it to submit to you? Is the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s seal so powerful that you can’t fuse with it?” Eggy asked.

“I’ve checked using Dark Plunder. There’s indeed a restriction placed on the Descent of the Demon God. I could have broken the restriction and made it submit to me without triggering the restriction, but I suspect that the Descent of the Demon God is telling the truth. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted won’t be able to find me if I fuse with it,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you planning to wait for the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted to come to you?” Eggy asked.

“I’m worried about Wang Qiang. I can’t leave him to the lurch,” Chu Feng replied.
