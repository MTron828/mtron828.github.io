Chapter 5914: Lonely No More

“Two hundred years ago?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The old man fell into deep thought after hearing those words. He slowly recounted some of the matters that he thought were more important, but Chu Feng thought that those were trivialities that couldn’t have caused the change in the Tan Clan’s underground chamber.

“Is there more?” Chu Feng asked.

The old man revealed a few more things, but those were even more inconsequential.

Chu Feng had been paying close heed to the old man. The latter looked nervous and fearful, so it was unlikely that he was lying. It was likely he didn’t know what happened two hundred years ago.

In truth, it was doubtful whether the Tan Clan themselves knew what happened too, considering that the formation was beyond them.

Thus, Chu Feng tried another direction. “Are there any Tan Clansmen living outside?”

“There is,” the old man replied.

“Write down where all of them are staying.” Chu Feng waved his sleeves and manifested a brush with his spirit power. “This matter is very important. I hope you don’t withhold anything from me, or else I can easily find you.”

There was a cold glint in Chu Feng’s eyes.

“Rest assured, milord. I won’t hide anything!” The old man was so terrified that he wouldn’t stop sweating. He picked up the brush and began writing things down.

Chu Feng eyed the content before leaving with Zi Ling.

Shortly after they left, the formation shrouding the old man seeped into his head. The old man shuddered, and it took a while before he snapped out of it.

“I... What happened?” The old man was dazed for a moment before he continued on his way.

Chu Feng’s earlier formation had erased his memories, so he couldn’t remember what had happened after the formation enveloped him. He didn’t remember Chu Feng’s appearance, and he had no recollection of divulging the Tan Clansmen’s whereabouts either.

“Big brother Chu Feng’s formation is getting increasingly exquisite. I doubt that I can catch up with you as a world spiritist anymore,” Zi Ling remarked.

She had been proficient as a world spiritist back in the Nine Provinces Continent, and she had been practicing her skills all this while too. It was just that she paled far in comparison to him.

“I just thought that it would be safer to erase his memories,” Chu Feng replied.

“I’m just referring to that. When did you leave a tracking mark on him? I didn’t notice it,” Zi Ling said.

“I did it while he was leaving. I didn’t mean to keep it from you; it’s just a habit,” Chu Feng replied.

He was so used to situations going awry that it became a habit for him to discreetly prepare his hand.

“I know. I don’t blame you. I’m just amazed by how much you have grown,” Zi Ling replied.

“You have grown fast too,” Chu Feng replied.

“It’s nothing compared to you. You did it all by yourself, whereas I had been relying on you. Your father would have never become my master if not for my relationship with you, and I would have never reached my current cultivation level either,” Zi Ling replied.

“Don’t say that. I know you well. You worked harder than anyone to reach your current level. Ultimately, my father took you in as his disciple because he had a high opinion of your willpower. His effort would have been in vain if you didn’t work hard yourself,” Chu Feng said.

He knew that Zi Ling must have been through a lot of hardship, just that she never voiced them aloud in front of him.

Zi Ling smiled. “The path of cultivation is an endless uphill climb. Those who don’t advance will only regress. No one has it easy. Big brother Chu Feng has been working hard, so the least I can do is not to drag you down. I hope to continue being by your side, but not as a damsel in distress. I want us to fight together as we did when we first met. I like that feeling.”

Chu Feng felt dazed. Zi Ling had matured a lot from before, but her smile still looked the same as before.

“It’s the same for me too.” Chu Feng nodded with an expectant smile.

The two humble youths back then had matured into top prodigies in the vast world of cultivation. They would have been considered gods if they returned to the continent where they came from, but the experiences they shared back then remained precious to them.

The two of them cherished those memories.

Chu Feng had to admit that Zi Ling’s companionship had dispelled his loneliness and filled him with bliss. His life might have been fraught with hardships, but thinking back, there were many pleasant things too.

Having the company of one’s lover was always one of the best things in the world.

The two of them chatted while searching for the surviving Tan Clansmen. Most of the Tan Clansmen who had parted from the clan back then were still residing in this realm, except for one family, so it was not difficult to find them.

Chu Feng informed them about the tragedy that had befallen the Tan Clan, and that horrified them. He took this opportunity to ask them what happened two hundred years ago, but none of them knew what was the trigger.

Left with no choice, Chu Feng could only search for the family of Tan Clansmen who had migrated from this realm. They were still in the same starfield, so it wasn’t too tough to find them.

What they saw surprised them.

The Tan Clan was not prestigious, but those who left the Tan Clan still lived rather comfortable lives. Yet, this family lived in seclusion amid a jungle, and their house looked extremely humble.

It looked like a house built by an ordinary mortal.

A middle-aged man was outside the house brewing medicine while coughing now and then. He looked old, but Chu Feng could tell that he was at most a few hundred years old. He didn’t possess any cultivation as his dantian was absent.

Chu Feng took a closer look at the middle-aged man—he could see through his clothes to see a long scar where his dantian was. The scar was probably related to his missing dantian.

Seconds later, Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed. He could estimate when the scar was left behind, and he deduced it to be around two hundred years ago. Could it be a coincidence?

Thus, Chu Feng and Zi Ling disguised themselves before descending before the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man looked wary and fearful when he saw them.

“Don’t panic. We’re on close terms with an elder from the Tan Clan. We came here to inform you of a matter,” Chu Feng said.

“What is it?” the middle-aged man asked.

“The Tan Clan has been destroyed.”

The middle-aged man was surprisingly calm. “We’re no longer related to the Tan Clan.”
