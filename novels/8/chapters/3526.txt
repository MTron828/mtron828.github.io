Chapter 3526 - I Only Fear That You’re Unable To Take Defeat With Grace

This person of the younger generation had a somewhat mature look to him.

Even though he was clearly under a hundred years old, he had a look close to that of a middle-aged man.

Had it not been for the fact that martial cultivators possessed very strong senses, and could roughly determine one’s age, no one would believe that person to be a person of the younger generation.

That said, although he was a person of the younger generation, he was in his nineties.

Furthermore, not only did he had a very mediocre look, but his physical appearance could even be said to be ugly. Although he was clad in a gorgeous outfit, he paired his clothing in a very distinctive manner. His look resembled that of a person who had newly gained wealth, and did not possess any aesthetic taste. As for things such as an air of might, there was simply none present on him.

However, even though a person of the younger generation that looked like this came before the Chu Heavenly Clan and spoke rudely before everyone else, no one, not even the elders from the Tantai Heavenly Clan, dared to say anything about it.

The reason for that was because of the title plate on his waist.

Divine Body Royal City!!!

If title plates represented protective amulets, then the title plate of the Divine Body Royal City would be a golden death-exemption amulet.

In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the Starfield Master Realm was the fully deserving overlord.

The Ten Great Heavenly Clans possessed reputations that resonated throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

As for the Divine Body Royal City, Monstrous Holy City and Ancestral Dragon Martial City, they were three powers that no one dared to look down upon.

Not only were the Three Cities all headed by Utmost Exalted-level experts, but they also possessed immense resources. Their strength could be said to be unfathomable. Even the people from the Starfield Master Realm would not rashly provoke the people from the Three Cities. As for the other powers, there was simply no need to mention what their standpoints were...

“So it’s actually Young Master Kong Tianhui of Divine Body Royal City,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Kong Tianhui, could it be... it’s the Divine Body Holy City’s City Master, Divine King Kong Que’s son?” The crowd revealed astonished looks.

Although the Three Cities did not participate in worldly affairs, and were relatively mysterious compared to other powers, so much that only very rarely would one encounter experts, and especially the younger generations, from the Three Cities, their reputation and prowess was known throughout the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Thus, everyone knew that the current city master of Divine Body Royal City was Divine King Kong Que. Furthermore, everyone knew that he was an Utmost Exalted-level expert.

Divine King Kong Que was someone who had a very robust and healthy body. Furthermore, as he was fond of pleasures, he had a lot of sons and daughters. Adding all of them together, they numbered more than three thousand. Furthermore, those three thousand plus sons and daughters were all from his legitimate wives and concubines. His illegitimate children were not included in this number.

Merely the number of sons and daughters within a hundred years of age numbered in the several dozen.

However, only nine of them were worthy of respect. Among them, two were the most famous.

One was a woman by the name of Kong Ci. The other was a man by the name of Kong Tianhui.

Rumors had it that Kong Ci and Kong Tianhui possessed exceptional talent, and were rarely seen demon-level geniuses with strength comparable to the strongest genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Linghu Hongfei.

It was only because the Three Cities did not participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars that no one had ever witnessed their true strength.

In fact, for many people, they’d only heard their names before, and had never seen their faces.

That was the reason why the crowd became so astonished after the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief mentioned the name Kong Tianhui.

In fact, it was not only the bystanders that were astonished. Even that person of the younger generation from Divine Body Royal City was surprised.

“You actually know of me?” That person of the younger generation from Divine Body Royal City looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with a surprised expression.

His words verified his identity.

He was indeed the son of Divine King Kong Que, Kong Tianhui.

“This old man was fortunate enough to have met young master Kong before. It’s simply that young master Kong did not remember this old man,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Was it on Mount Moliang?” asked Kong Tianhui.

“Precisely,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Back then... I was merely nine years old. Ninety years have already passed. I never expected that you’d actually still remember me,” said Kong Tianhui.

“Indeed. Young master Kong was still only a child back then. Compared to back then, there have been enormous changes to young master Kong. However, there is still quite a bit of resemblance,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“There’s no need to bother with superfluous words and flatteries. I came here today to challenge Chu Feng. Call him out.”

Kong Tianhui had a mocking sneer on his face. That arrogance of his was not only a sign of not placing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief in his eyes. Instead, he was not placing anyone present in his eyes.

Seeing such behavior from Kong Tianhui, the crowd all felt displeased. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This was especially true in regards to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. They were truly enraged.

Merely, due to the fact that Kong Tianhui was from Divine Body Royal City, no one dared to voice their anger.

As for the bystanders, they were also displeased by Kong Tianhui’s behavior. Merely, as this Kong Tianhui had come for the Chu Heavenly Clan, they would naturally not provoke needless troubles for the sake of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“It would appear that although Divine Body Royal City has a great reputation, they’re lacking in etiquette.”

Suddenly, a mocking voice exploded.

Who was it? Who was so daring as to provoke him like that even after knowing his identity? Furthermore, that person was even bringing the entire Divine Body Royal City into it.

When that voice was heard, many people became extremely curious as to who it belonged to.

When the crowd discovered the person who said those words, they all came to realize why that person dared to be that audacious.

As it turned out, Chu Feng had arrived.

The crowd all knew very well how bold Chu Feng was. There was simply nothing that he did not dare to do.

However, it remained that Kong Tianhui was from Divine Body Royal City. For Chu Feng to say that sort of thing, the crowd still became worried for him.

“You dare to speak to me in such a manner? Who are you?” Sure enough, Kong Tianhui turned to Chu Feng with a scowl.

“Who am I? Am I not the person that you’ve come to challenge?”

“Next time, you should study a bit about the person you want to challenge first,” Chu Feng said with a sneer.

“So you’re that Chu Feng. And here I thought that you did not dare to show your face. Since you know that I’ve come to challenge you, do you dare to accept my challenge?” asked Kong Tianhui.

Even without him re-emphasizing the fact that he came to challenge Chu Feng, everyone knew that Kong Tianhui had come to challenge Chu Feng.

Merely, the crowd were confused. The reason why the geniuses of the Three Cities rarely left their cities was because of the rules of their cities.

Thus, why would Kong Tianhui suddenly appear to challenge Chu Feng?

Could it be that the Divine Body Royal Clan no longer planned to withdraw from worldly affairs?

But, even if that was the case, what would cause them to suddenly change their manner of conduct?

Could it be because of the conflict between the Starfield Master Realm and the Linghu Heavenly Clan?

Merely because Kong Tianhui decided to challenge Chu Feng, the crowd began to make all sorts of guesses.

That said, what the crowd was more concerned with was who was stronger between Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui.

Before the gazes of the crowd, Chu Feng chuckled. He said, “I only fear that you’re unable to take defeat with grace.”
