Chapter 5535: The True Assimilation Formation

“Brother Chu Feng, are you fine?”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Upon seeing Qi Weidao’s retreat, Long Chengyu quickly descended from the sky to head over to Chu Feng’s side, wanting to feed a pill to him.

“Brother Chengyu, take everyone and this formation away from this place first,” Chu Feng said.

“All right.”

Without any hesitation, Long Chengyu carried the formation together with Chu Feng and the others away from the formation core, though he didn’t go too far away. At the same time, Feng Jiuyue constructed a concealment formation around them out of fear that Qi Weidao would pursue them.

Shortly after they left, the formation core opened. A figure quickly dashed in—Qi Weidao.

“Damn it! That fellow got it for free!”

Both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen felt indignance swelling in their hearts, especially when they saw Qi Weidao’s avatar armor visibly fusing into his body under the effects of the formation core. They felt awful knowing that they had missed a precious fortuitous encounter.

“Haha! Chu Feng and Long Chengyu, you have lost this battle! Do you know why you have lost? The two of you weren’t vicious enough. I was already at my limit. I was forcing myself to hold on. You only had to persevere a moment longer, and I would have been defeated. However, it’s too late now. You have lost your chance. This land has granted me immeasurable power. If you dare come close to this formation core, even if it’s Long Chengyu with the formation’s enhancement, I’d still be able to easily decimate you!” Qi Weidao spouted those words while laughing arrogantly.

“Hah! He was still talking about sharing the formation core with us a moment ago, but he’s finally showing his true colors now. That despicable thing!”

The Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen were infuriated.

“Ignore him. He won’t live for long,” Chu Feng suddenly said.

The crowd turned their attention to Chu Feng, only to see that his eyes were focused on a compass he held in his hand. The compass had opened up, and his hand was swiftly adjusting the inside of it.

“Young hero Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?” one of the confused Totem Dragon Clansmen asked.

“Shut up!” Long Chengyu roared. “Don’t interrupt Chu Feng.”

He knew that Chu Feng must have noticed something and was at a crucial phase of preparing something. It would be foolish to interrupt Chu Feng at this juncture.

Kacha!

Chu Feng suddenly stopped moving.

The compass released a faint light as it slowly took form. It was no longer as chaotic as it was before. Two doors could be vaguely seen inside the compass, but there seemed to be a protective formation shrouding the two doors.

“It’s fine now, Brother Chengyu. We have won,” Chu Feng replied.

“Brother Chu Feng, did you manage to decipher the compass?”

“Mmhm,” Chu Feng replied with a nod. “I could have put my full strength into channeling the formation. The worst that could happen was me passing out for a moment. In other words, you had a shot at killing Qi Weidao. Yet, I asked you to retreat instead. Do you want to know why?”

“Why?” Long Chengyu asked.

“That formation core is a trap. This entire realm is a trap. You could receive some benefits from entering the formation core, but you’ll quickly lose your life there,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah? That’s a trap?” The crowd was horrified.

“Yes, this entire realm is a trap. We have been treated as tributes from the very start. The completion of the formation will temper your bloodlines, but the purpose is to refine your bloodlines to the peak before devouring your energies. I don’t know if the Demon Crane is truly an assimilation formation or not, but this is definitely an assimilation formation,” Chu Feng said.

“This!”

“But…”

The Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen found this hard to believe.

“Young master, what’s going on? Is young hero Chu Feng speaking the truth? Why did our clan chief send us here if that’s the case?” The Totem Dragon Clansmen turned to Long Chengyu for answers.

Long Chengyu was conflicted as to whether he should tell them the truth.

“Brother Chengyu, there’s no reason to keep it a secret anymore at this juncture,” Chu Feng said.

“That darned Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!” Long Chengyu cursed before turning to the Totem Dragon Clansmen to explain the matter. “We came here under the request of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. It’s unlikely that my father knew that the Totem Phoenix Clan and the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan would be here too. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master has taken us for a ride!”

Long Chengyu then turned to Feng Jiuyue and asked, “Feng Jiuyue, there should be no reason for you to hide it anymore, right? Tell us the truth. Is your Totem Phoenix Clan collaborating with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? Also, were you aware that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan was still around before this?”

Feng Jiuyue had a hesitant look on her face.

“Big sister, there’s no need to hide it anymore now that things have come to this point,” Feng Tiansheng said. He turned to Long Chengyu and answered the latter’s questions, “Yes, our Totem Phoenix Clan has been working with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. The place where our clan has gone into seclusion was provided by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. However, we didn’t know that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was cooperating with the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan or that we were leaping to our doom by coming here. I don’t think my father is aware of this. We have all been deceived by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. He told us to cherish this opportunity, and that he’ll help our clan rise once more. What a load of bull!”

Feng Tiansheng clenched his fists tightly in anger. The Totem Phoenix Clansmen also hurled vulgarities as well, upset that they had been taken as fools. Unlike the Totem Dragon Clansmen, they were aware that they had come here at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s request. After all, they had been working with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion all this while.

Unlike the agitated Feng Tiansheng and the others, Feng Jiuyue was much calmer. She turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Chu Feng, could there be a mistake? Is this… an assimilation formation?”

She was still reluctant to believe the truth.

“There’s no mistake about it. Look at Qi Weidao. His complexion has changed.” Chu Feng turned his eyes toward the formation core.

The crowd did the same as well.

They noticed that Qi Weidao’s arrogant expression had vanished without a trace. He was looking around in a fluster. Moments later, his face warped in pain, scrunching tighter with each passing second.

“GAH! What the hell is this? What the hell is this?!”

As soon as Qi Weidao realized that something was amiss, he tried to escape the formation core, but he was unable to get away no matter how he struggled. It was as if he had been held down by some invisible force.
