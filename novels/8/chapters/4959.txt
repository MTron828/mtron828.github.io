Chapter 4959: Wretched Black Demon

Those from the Zhuge Clan looked at the figure blocking their path with a mixture of unease and hostility. They recognized the person standing in their path.&nbsp;

It was a renowned world spiritist of the Nine Souls Galaxy.&nbsp;

“Wretched Black Demon?”&nbsp;

A deep frown appeared on the face of the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief. The person standing before him was not someone whom he was confident of defeating.&nbsp;

After all, the other party was the famous Wretched Black Demon.

“Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, it has been a while. I hope you’re doing fine,” the Wretched Black Demon said with a smile. It looked almost like an amicable greeting between two old pals. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

However, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t let down his guard at all.&nbsp;

“Why are you here? You have been eyeing our Zhuge Clan?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

It went without saying that the Zhuge Clan had hidden their presence with concealment formations, but the Wretched Black Demon was still able to find them so easily. The only possibility was that the Wretched Black Demon had been eyeing them right from the start.

“There’s no need to get so tense. I didn’t come here to pick a fight. As long as you hand over Shengguang Guangyao’s treasure and Situ Qi’s treasures, you’re free to go wherever you want to,” the Wretched Black Demon said,&nbsp;

However, that only led to an outburst of hostility from the Zhuge Clan.

It couldn’t be more clear that the Wretched Black Demon came with malicious intent, so they wouldn’t bother trying to uphold civility with him. It was just that their overwhelming hostility hardly fazed the Wretched Black Demon at all.&nbsp;

“Wretched Black Demon, Lord Situ Qi has only left the legacy formation behind. Lord Zhuge Guangyao was also only able to reach his level of accomplishment due to his talent. I’m not sure what rumors you have heard, but I’m afraid those are all hearsay. Surely someone of your stature wouldn’t blindly trust rumors, right?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief said.&nbsp;

“Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, there’s one thing you got right. I am not one to let rumors faze me, but that’s precisely the reason why I know for certain that Zhuge Guangyao did possess a treasure, and that Situ Qi didn’t just leave behind a legacy formation.&nbsp;

“In view of our ties, I’ll give you a choice. If you hand over what I’ve demanded, I’ll let your Zhuge Clan off. Otherwise, I’ll slaughter everyone here and find those items myself,” the Wretched Black Demon said.

“Wretched Black Demon, we’re both rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivators. Do you think that I’d fear you?”&nbsp;

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan drew his Exalted Armament and released his oppressive might.&nbsp;

“Heh… Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, I thought that you were a smarter person than this. You should know that you aren’t a match for me.”&nbsp;

The Wretched Black Demon burst into laughter, but his eyes were gradually turning cold. He released the oppressive might of a rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivator as well upon the Zhuge Clan.&nbsp;

“Hmph!”

With a harrumph, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief shook the Exalted Armament in his hand and trembled the space around him, dissipating the oppressive might from the Wretched Black Demon.&nbsp;

He didn’t just stop there. With the Exalted Armament in hand, he began charging toward the Wretched Black Demon.

The Wretched Black Demon quickly drew his Exalted Armament as well to engage the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief in a fight.&nbsp;

The two of them were initially emanating the auras of rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivators, but runes soon appeared on the body of the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief, causing his cultivation to rise to rank nine Martial Exalted level.&nbsp;

However, the Wretched Black Demon was enveloped in black flames the next moment, resulting in his cultivation rising to rank nine Martial Exalted level too.&nbsp;

Both of them possessed means to raise their cultivation ranks

The other members of the Zhuge Clan had no way of interfering in a battle of this caliber, so they could only watch from afar. They couldn’t see the details of the battle clearly, but through their sharpened senses as world spiritist, they could tell that…&nbsp;

Their clan chief equaled the Wretched Black Demon in terms of power. While both of them had different strengths, it looked like neither side was at an advantage. That gave them a sliver of hope.

One must know that the Wretched Black Demon was famous, reputed to be the two strongest world spiritists of the Nine Souls Galaxy together with the Sagacious Grandmaster.

But of course, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief was no weakling either. He was able to stand his own against the Wretched Black Demon and possibly triumph over the latter too.&nbsp;

Boom!

However, when a wave of spirit power began pouring out, the tides of the battle started changing.

The Wretched Black Demon had chosen to change his fighting style. He retracted his martial power and began releasing his spirit power.&nbsp;

His spirit power was violent and aggressive, and he was able to control it with great versatility. Using his spirit power, he was even able to tear through the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief’s powerful Exalted Taboo Martial Skills.&nbsp;

Before long, he had already started to suppress the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief.&nbsp;

The Wretched Black Demon’s spirit power had already reached a level comparable to a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator, and it was much stronger than the martial prowess of the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief.&nbsp;

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief tried his best to fend against the Wretched Black Demon’s aggression, but in a moment of carelessness, he was struck squarely by the latter’s formation. Not only was he sent flying across the air, but the arm he was holding his Exalted Armament with was severed too.&nbsp;

Having lost his Exalted Armament and an arm, the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief fell into a severely disadvantageous position. Knowing that the odds were against him now, he performed a feint and quickly backed away.&nbsp;

What was worth mentioning was that the Wretched Black Demon didn’t give chase. Instead, he halted his attack.&nbsp;

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief quickly retreated back to the side of his clan members before reassessing the Wretched Black Demon with a grim look on his face.

“You have reached rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation?”

The Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief looked at the powerful spirit power enveloping the Wretched Black Demon with eyes filled with fear. He knew that he wasn’t a match for the current Wretched Black Demon.

Based on what he knew, the Wretched Black Demon had reached a bottleneck that prevented him from reaching rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation. This bottleneck was extremely difficult to overcome, likely to cap his strength till the day of his death.

However, it was clear that the Wretched Black Demon had successfully overcome his limits, and that was what surprised the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief.&nbsp;

“Are you blind? Can’t you tell with your own eyes?” the Wretched Black Demon asked mockingly.&nbsp;

“Who helped you?” the Zhuge Clan’s Clan Chief asked.&nbsp;

“Help? What kind of nonsense is that? I made a breakthrough with my own strength. Why would I need another person’s help? I can tell you that this is nothing more than the start. Before long, I’ll be stepping into the ranks of a God-cloak World Spiritist,” the Wretched Black Demon spoke confidently. &nbsp;

Those from the Zhuge Clan fell into despair.&nbsp;

How could they not feel despair when they were faced with such an enemy?
