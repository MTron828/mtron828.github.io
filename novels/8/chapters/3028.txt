Chapter 3028 - Waterfall Formation

All of the people from the Luo Family felt that Xu Jialuo was an actual cultivation genius.

They all felt that he would one day become a dragon and soar into the sky. At that time, their Luo Family would also bask in his light.

Thus, no matter how much Luo Dali urged them, saying that Xu Jialuo was a phony, he would only receive supercilious looks from his family. Simply no one was willing to listen to him.

After so many years, Xu Jialuo’s status in their Luo Family had surpassed his, the eldest son.

Luo Dali even felt certain that the position of the family head would be passed onto Xu Jialuo instead of him in the future.

As such, how could Luo Dali be fond of Xu Jialuo?

......

Chu Feng did not hear the conversation between Luo Dali and his younger sister. However, Chu Feng was able to guess what they were talking about based on their expressions.

He knew that Luo Dali had leaked information about him to his younger sister.

Fortunately, his younger sister did not believe him. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have cast such a look of disdain at him.

Actually, Chu Feng had seen countless people like Luo Dali’s younger sister. Chu Feng simply did not care what she thought of him. In fact, he did not care what any of the people there thought of him.

What Chu Feng wanted was very simple - he wanted to successfully infiltrate the Bandit Beasts’ hideout and seize their treasures. After that, he would eliminate this scourge on the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Chu Feng and the others were kept there for several hours. During that period of time, Bandit Beasts returned nonstop. Furthermore, they would all return with badly beaten and half-dead humans.

Chu Feng felt that their goal this time around was not plunder or looting. Rather, they were purely capturing humans to serve as their slaves.

“Why aren’t those guys returning?”

“Truly useless. We had them go and capture the escapee, yet the escapee returned himself, with them nowhere to be seen.”

The Bandit Beasts were mumbling and complaining as they chatted with one another. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Chu Feng was able to tell that ‘those guys’ that they spoke of should be the group of Bandit Beasts that were dispatched to pursue Luo Dali, who had fortunately encountered him, and thus met their fate.

Suddenly, a Bandit Beast arrived before that small commander-looking Bandit Beast and asked with a soft voice, “Milord, could they have encountered some sort of trouble?”

Hearing those words, that small commander’s gaze turned cautious. Then, he waved his sleeve and said, “We wait no more. Return.”

After he finished saying those words, the small commander led all of the Bandit Beasts present and brought Chu Feng and all of the other captured humans with them and began to proceed deeper into the mountains.

“It would appear that they do not suspect you. You did not allow yourself to be beaten in vain. Hehe,” Her Lady Queen’s voice was heard. It could be seen that Her Lady Queen also heaved a sigh of relief.

After all, the Bandit Beasts had been around for a very long time. Many people had tried to infiltrate their headquarters, only to fail in the end. This meant that the Bandit Beasts were extremely cautious beings.

Thus, before arriving, Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng and Chu Youyuan were all very worried that their true strength and intentions would be discovered by the Bandit Beasts.

Should that happen, they would not be able to infiltrate the Bandit Beasts’ headquarters.

However, seeing things now, at least that group of Bandit Beasts did not make the connection between the failure of the group of Bandit Beasts that were dispatched to pursue Luo Dali and Chu Feng.

“These Bandit Beasts would commit all sorts of crimes. However, their strengths are very weak. Likely, it is very common for them to be captured and killed by cultivators while they’re out of their hideout.”

“Thus, they have already grown accustomed to their members failing to return. That is the reason why that small commander did not make a fuss about it.”

“However, the Bandit Beasts must possess some special methods. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to be able to exist in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for so long. Regardless, we cannot lower our guard,” Chu Feng said.

“Mn. Taking care of this bunch is very easy. However, taking the treasures into consideration, it is best for you to be extra careful.”

“It wouldn’t actually matter for this Queen. However, you, on the other hand, will have to suffer grievances,” Her Lady Queen said.

“No, it’s nothing. What about this could possibly be considered a grievance? While it might appear that I have suffered some grievances after being beaten up by them, they are the ones that are actually being played by me. I am in fact quite fond of toying with this bunch of animals,” Chu Feng said with a mischievous smile.

“Haha, it is precisely that good mentality of yours that I am fond of. Since that’s the case, you might as well continue on with your disguise all the way through. This Queen is also interested in seeing exactly what these animals’ hideout looks like,” Her Lady Queen’s eyes were filled with anticipation as she said those words.

It was actually not only Her Lady Queen who was looking forward to it; Chu Feng was also looking forward to seeing the Bandit Beasts’ base.

He wanted to know exactly what sort of hideout was capable of protecting such weak animals that refused to shrink away from any crime, no matter how hideous.

Afterwards, Chu Feng followed the Bandit Beasts and began to proceed deeper into the mountain.

After walking for some time, they arrived at a cave. The cave was very well-hidden. However, to Chu Feng’s surprise, there was actually a waterfall inside the cave. The waterfall had no visible water source. It looked very unconventional.

“Lord Youyuan, that should be a formation, right?” As a world spiritist, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that the waterfall was a spirit formation.

“Indeed, that’s a formation, a formation capable of detecting one’s cultivation,” as Chu Youyuan was a rank two Exalted, he was able to tell what that waterfall was with a single glance.

“It would appear that the Bandit Beasts are truly careful. For them to place this formation here, they must be afraid that someone might be trying to conceal their cultivation to infiltrate their headquarters.”

“Chu Feng, here, pinch this. I guarantee you that that formation will not be able to expose your cultivation,” Chu Youyuan secretly handed a transparent pearl-like pellet to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng immediately pinched the pellet.

After pinching the pellet, Chu Feng was able to feel an invisible power dispersing from the pellet and entering his body. That power would not exist for a long time. However, it was capable of concealing Chu Feng’s cultivation temporarily.

“Chu Feng, how was it? Is that thing Chu Youyuan gave you of any use?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“If that pellet is ineffective, I’m afraid there wouldn’t be anything else that could conceal my cultivation,” Chu Feng gasped with admiration. As a world spiritist, he was able to tell how powerful the pellet Chu Youyuan gave him was.

Although the pellet’s effects would only be temporary, it was able to absolutely conceal Chu Feng’s cultivation when it was in effect.

A treasure like that must be of considerable value. In fact, it could even be said to be a treasure that could not be purchased.
