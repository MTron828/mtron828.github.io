Chapter 2920 - Gathering Of The Three Beauties

Threat. That was most definitely a threat. After Jinshi Bo and the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder left, many people present revealed worried expressions in their eyes as they looked to Chu Feng.

The Goldenstone Royal Clan was not an ordinary power. They were the overlords of an Upper Realm.

Chu Feng had offended a power of that caliber. It was extremely dangerous.

However, Chu Feng was not panicking at all.

Threat?

In his journey from the Nine Provinces Continent’s tiny little Azure Province to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Chu Feng had received no shortage of threats.

Thus, Chu Feng simply did not fear threats.

Thus, the current Chu Feng was extremely carefree. He was simply not affected by Jinshi Bo’s threat at all.

At that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Song Yunfei. He said, “Brother Song, our gambling match hasn’t ended yet. Do you still want to continue?”

Song Yunfei’s expression was very ugly after witnessing Chu Feng winning against Jinshi Bo. After hearing Chu Feng’s question, his expression grew even uglier.

Chu Feng was capable of winning against even Jinshi Bo. He was even capable of selecting the King Among Stones from the third floor. Was there even a need to question whether Chu Feng had relied on luck or not?

How could Song Yunfei possibly dare to continue gambling with Chu Feng?

Thus, Song Yunfei did not answer Chu Feng. Without saying anything, he waved his sleeve and left.

Song Yunfei had truly fallen head first at that moment.

“The gambling matches today have ended. Everyone, it’s time to disperse,” the grey-haired old man said.

Once he said those words, even though the bystanding gamblers were extremely unwilling, they still ended up leaving.

Although they were extremely unwilling to leave, their faces were filled with excitement.

Their journey had not been in vain. They had witnessed a gambling match with ten million Immortal Martial Stones at stake. This was something that had never happened before in the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

If word this matter were to spread, it would definitely astonish the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

As people that had witnessed the event, they possessed the qualifications to boast.

After the crowd left, the grey-haired old man asked Chu Feng, “Little friend Chu Feng, the Grand Auction Assembly is about to begin. Do you want this old man to cut up this Immortal Martial Stone for you, or do you want to bring it away as it is?”

“I will have to trouble senior with cutting it for me,” Chu Feng said.

Then, the grey-haired old man began to cut Chu Feng’s enormous Immortal Martial Stone into standard-sized pieces.

In the end, Chu Feng’s enormous Immortal Martial Stone managed to produce twelve million three hundred and seventy thousand standard-sized Immortal Martial Stones.

Adding on the ten million Immortal Martial Stones Chu feng had won from Jinshi Bo and the eighteen million he had gained from the Ghost Sect Hall, Chu Feng currently possessed forty million Immortal Martial Stones.

With such an enormous sum of wealth, Chu Feng’s certainty of being able to successfully win the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram had increased substantially.

Afterwards, Chu Feng, Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi were personally guided by a Ghost Sect Hall elder. They entered a tunnel and arrived directly at the auction floor.

The auction floor was enormous. It was capable of holding over a million people.

At that moment, that enormous auction floor was already packed with people.

“There’s this many people? They couldn’t possibly all be here to bid on treasures, right?” Chu Feng turned to ask the Ghost Sect Hall elder that had guided them there.

“No, the great majority of them are here to enjoy the excitement. After all, there will be precious treasures in this Grand Auction Assembly.”

“The Grand Auction Assembly will continue for ten consecutive days and nights. During this period of time, a lot of treasures will appear.”

“That said, the most precious treasures will be auctioned on the first day. If the process is quick, they will generally be auctioned off in several hours.”

“The reason for this arrangement is so that the Grand Auction Assembly can be more convenient for those grand individuals.”

“After all, they’re only interested in the precious goods,” the Ghost Sect Hall elder that had guided Chu Feng and the others explained.

Afterwards, guided by that elder, Chu Feng and the others arrived at the summit of that enormous auction floor.

“Little friend Chu Feng, Elder Xingyi, Miss Xia, this here has been prepared by our Lord Hall Master for you all.”

That elder stopped upon reaching the entrance. It seemed like he did not possess the qualifications to enter that place.

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng, Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi did not hesitate; the three of them directly entered.

Upon entering, they discovered that the people present were truly remarkable.

Compared to below, this place was much more spacious. Like the third floor of the Stone Gambling Hall, it too was an isolated space.

The singing of birds and the fragrance of flowers were present here. However, all of the living organisms were food.

That’s right, they were a special sort of food. They seemed to possess life, and were capable of letting out sounds and moving about freely. However, they were actually extremely delicious types of food.

As for the water from the various springs bubbling in that place, they were all kinds of fine liquor.

By the same accord, the scenery there was also extremely enchanting.

Furthermore, when one looked down from there, one would be able to see the entire auction hall. It was like the people there were gods looking down upon the mortals below. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

That said, there were quite a lot of people there.

Song Yunfei and Ren Xiaoyao were also there.

Apart from the two of them, there were also other people of the younger generation with extraordinary status. Those were members of the younger generations from the Chu Heavenly Clan.

One among them was a familiar face. She was none other than one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Three Great Beauties, Chu Lingxi.

That said, there were two other people from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations that were extremely eye-catching.

One among them was another major beauty. Her beauty was on par with Chu Lingxi and Xia Yun’er. She was someone who would inevitably cause the attention of others to shift toward her the moment she appeared.

That said, while that woman’s face was extremely beautiful, her beauty was inferior to Chu Lingxi and Xia Yun’er’s. However, she emitted an extraordinary air, and a strong aura.

Most importantly, that woman’s cultivation was also extremely strong.

Rank eight True Immortal. That woman was actually a rank eight True Immortal like Song Yunfei.

Even without others introducing him, Chu Feng knew who that woman was. She must be one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Three Great Beauties, the second ranked individual on the Demon-level Geniuses List, the number one genius among the Chu Heavenly Clan’s current younger generations, Chu Ruoshi.

In other words, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Three Great Beauties were all gathered here.

Apart from Chu Ruoshi, there was a man. He too was very eye-catching.

Although that man’s cultivation was inferior to Chu Ruoshi’s, he still possessed the cultivation of a rank seven True Immortal.

Likely, that man would be either Chu Huanyu or Chu Haoyan.

That said, regardless of who he might be, Chu Feng felt an intense hostility from his eyes. In fact, he even felt killing intent.

“Who is that person? The gaze that he is looking at you with is abnormal,” Her Lady Queen also noticed the chilly gaze from that man.

“It’s fine. Regardless of who he might be, I do not fear him,” Chu Feng said indifferently.

“Chu Feng, that woman with the cultivation of rank eight True Immortal is the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Ruoshi.”

“As for that man with the cultivation of rank seven True Immortal, he is the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Huanyu. The two of them are both the Chu Heavenly Clan’s most important geniuses. You must not clash with them. Even if they are to speak to you unpleasantly, it would be best for you to endure them.”

Right at that moment, Xia Yun’er’s voice transmission entered Chu Feng’s ears.

Hearing her voice transmission, Chu Feng finally realized that the man who was looking at him with such hostility in his eyes was actually Chu Huanyu.
