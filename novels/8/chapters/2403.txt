Chapter 2403 - The Most Dangerous Forbidden Area

This spirit formation was located at the center of the ancient pagoda. Surrounding the spirit formation were eighteen elderly individuals.

Of these eighteen elderly individuals, seventeen of them were peak Martial Ancestors. Furthermore, many among them were world spiritists.

As for the final individual, it was a woman with white hair, white clothes and a face covered in wrinkles. She possessed the same sort of aura as Elder Kong Shunlian; she was a True Immortal-level expert.

As for that person, she was one of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders, Kong Yuehua.

“Buzz~~~”

The strange change to the spirit formation caused all of the elders present, including Kong Yuehua, to suddenly open their eyes.

As they looked at the change in the spirit formation, they all revealed a change in expression. Then, the other seventeen elders turned their gazes to Kong Yuehua.

“Lady Utmost Exalted Elder, someone has intruded into the Grief Calamity Mountain Range!!!” The elders spoke in unison.

“I can see it myself without you all mentioning it,” Compared to the others, Kong Yuehua was more calm.

“Then, Lady Elder, what should we do?” The others asked in unison. Evidently, this was no small matter. Otherwise, they would not be this frantic.

“Call the Lord Clan Chief over, as well as all of the upper echelons of our clan that have not entered closed-door training,” Kong Yuehua said.

“Yes, Milady,” Once Kong Yuehua’s order was given, the remaining seventeen Utmost Exalted Elders immediately left the ancient pagoda and flew toward various different locations.

At that moment, only Kong Yuehua remained in the ancient pagoda. Her gaze grew sharp as she looked at the spirit formation that was giving off that unusual signal nonstop.

............

At that moment, Chu Feng was still within the mountain. He was running rapidly following the route in his mind. He did not dare to stop and rest because he knew that his spirit formation would not be able to last for long, and that he must reach the location he wanted to reach before the spirit formation’s effect disappeared.

As Chu Feng continued to run, he became even more certain that the map that Grandmaster Kai Hong had given him was correct.

The reason for that was because there were many hidden slaughtering formations in this seemingly-ordinary mountain range. While those slaughtering formations would not do anything to the ordinary little animals, if a martial cultivator was to approach them, they would immediately explode with extremely frightening power.

Furthermore, those slaughtering formations were extremely well-hidden. Even Chu Feng only noticed their existence after passing by them.

Fortunately, Chu Feng possessed the map in his head. He was only able to avoid those slaughtering formations by following the route according to the map in his head.

Else, even if Chu Feng were to become a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist and use his Heaven’s Eyes to observe his surroundings, it would have still been very difficult for him to evade the slaughtering formations in that place.

This vast mountain range was simply a vast slaughtering range. Devastating powers that Chu Feng could not withstand were hidden all over the place.

That said, even though Chu Feng had managed to avoid the slaughtering formations, he was still frowning. It seemed that he was pondering something.

Suddenly, Chu Feng said in a very stern manner, “Eggy, something’s amiss.”

“What’s wrong? What’s amiss?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“I keep feeling that this mountain range contains more than just slaughtering formations. It seems that there was a very powerful sensory formation that was also hidden here. It’s... very possible that I have already been discovered,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah? Then what do we do? They wouldn’t be coming in to capture you, right? Would you make it in time if you are to exit this place now?” After hearing what Chu Feng said, Her Lady Queen started to panic. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After all, this place was no ordinary place. Rather, it was the territory of one of the four strongest powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, the Kong Heavenly Clan.

There were simply too many experts in this place. They possessed even True Immortal-level experts. The amount of people capable of obliterating Chu Feng instantly were simply numerous.

If Chu Feng had really only come here to be a guest, the Kong Heavenly Clan would likely not dare to do anything to him due to external pressures.

However, when Chu Feng and Eggy arrived, they discovered that even though that place was not known to be a forbidden area, it was guarded exceptionally tightly -- the guards were actually all peak Martial Ancestors. In fact, even the spirit formation that had sealed this place was extremely powerful.

If it wasn’t because of the fact that Chu Feng’s Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation was so powerful, he would not be able to enter this mountain range even if no one tried to stop him.

From this, it could be seen that there must be something fishy regarding this place. Although this place was not known to be a forbidden area, it was very possible that the place was regarded as a forbidden area by the Kong Heavenly Clan.

A place like that would be a place that outsiders would not be allowed to trespass into. If Chu Feng’s intrusion into that place was to be seen by the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng would be in the wrong even if news of the matter were to spread. Thus, should Chu Feng be captured, he would definitely end up suffering enormously.

“Since I’ve already entered this place, I cannot return empty-handed,” Chu Feng did not have the intention to turn back. Instead, he continued to rapidly proceed forward.

“Very well. Since you’ve made the decision, then you might as well put your life on the line,” Seeing that Chu Feng was determined to proceed onward, Her Lady Queen did not advise him against it, but instead became excited.

Rather than retreating, Her Lady Queen was actually more fond of bravely advancing.

Furthermore, since Chu Feng had already been discovered, even if they were to retreat, it would still be very difficult to escape. Thus, it was better that he risk his life and continue onward.

After continuing to run for some time, Chu Feng arrived at the foot of a mountain and stopped.

“It’s here,” Chu Feng said.

“Here?” Her Lady Queen was surprised.

“If the map is correct, then this is the entrance. Merely, I will need to spend some time to open this entrance. I don’t know... if I can make it in time or not,” Chu Feng said.

“Regardless of whether or not you can make it in time, you must still give it a try. Go on ahead and do it. Since you’re already here, there’s no need to hesitate,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Eggy, you are thinking precisely the same as what I am thinking,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he began to set up his spirit formation.

It was a very complicated unsealing formation. It was also a spirit formation that Chu Feng had obtained from Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance. According to the instructions on the map, only this unsealing formation was capable of opening the entrance to allow Chu Feng to enter and obtain the treasures.

At the same time when Chu Feng was putting forth all his effort to set up the spirit formation so as to open the entrance, many experts were already gathered in that ancient pagoda.

These people were all experts from the Kong Heavenly Clan. Three among them were even True Immortals.

Among them were Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian. As for the last individual, he was a dark-skinned old man. Like Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian, he was also one of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders. His name was Kong Moyu.

“Lord Clan Chief is actually away at such a time. This is truly a bad coincidence,” Kong Yuehua sighed.

She had just received news that the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had a matter to attend to and left the Kong Heavenly Clan. Furthermore, the other Utmost Exalted Elders were still in closed-door training. As such, only the three of them were capable of overseeing the matters happening in the Kong Heavenly Clan.

“Even if Lord Clan Chief is to come now, the situation at hand will remain the same. One of our Kong Heavenly Clan’s most important forbidden areas, the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, has been intruded upon,” Elder Kong Moyu said.

“How can we be certain that this is caused by an outsider?” Kong Shunlian asked.

“The people of our Kong Heavenly Clan all know what sort of place the Grief Calamity Mountain Range is. No one will enter that place, they would not dare. Furthermore, I have just checked the records. Other than the people that have gone out of our Kong Heavenly Clan, the rest of our clansmen are practically all present. Thus... this can only be determined to be caused by an outsider,” Kong Moyu said.

“Lord Elder, then I will immediately order people to enter the Grief Calamity Mountain Range and capture that intruder,” A peak Martial Ancestor-level expert said.

“Impudent! What sort of place is the Grief Calamity Mountain Range?! You want to bring people in, what use is that other than throwing away your lives?!” Kong Moyu shouted furiously.

At that moment, that peak Martial Ancestor lowered his head in shame.

It was not only him; all of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s experts grew silent.

The Grief Calamity Mountain Range was a place that the people from their Kong Heavenly Clan never dared to enter.

It could be said that not only was the Grief Calamity Mountain Range a forbidden area, it was also their Kong Heavenly Clan’s most dangerous forbidden area.
