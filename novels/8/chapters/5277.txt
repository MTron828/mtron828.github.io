Chapter 5277: Hurry Up If You Wish to Live

The Totem Dragon Clan had already realized the situation too. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It really is the demon monk? He isn’t dead?!”

Long Zhen looked at the sky with murderous eyes. His hands cracked from how tightly clenched they were.

“Long Zhen, you aren’t to make a reckless move,” Long Junlin ordered.

He knew that it would be hard for Long Zhen to remain calm in the presence of the culprit who had taken his father’s life, but the current situation called for them to move carefully.

“Milord!”

The experts of the Totem Dragon Clan turned to Long Junlin for instructions.

“That woman didn’t lie to us. The demon monk is indeed still alive, and he’s after our Totem Dragon Clan,” Long Junlin said.

He took out a palm-sized golden box that emanated immense energy. He opened the box and carefully placed the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant in before entrusting the box to Long Zhen.

“Milord?” Long Zhen was confused.

“The demon monk has come prepared. There’s no guarantee that our reinforcement will arrive on time. If, by any chance, I am overpowered by the demon monk, you have to leave this place right away. I’ll cover for you,” Long Junlin instructed.

“Milord, you mustn’t!” Long Zhen exclaimed.

“Shut your mouth,” Long Junlin roared. “What I’m protecting here is the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant, not you!”

He stuffed the box containing the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant into Long Zhen’s hand. Not daring to defy his orders, Long Zhen could only carefully stow away the box.

Long Junlin turned to the crowd around him and addressed them.

“Everyone, the demon monk has come to exact vengeance on our Totem Dragon Clan. Retreating is not an option for us. It’ll be all good if we successfully take down the demon monk, but even if we find ourselves overwhelmed, we mustn’t soil the reputation of our clan.

“You should be aware of how important the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant is to us. Even at the cost of all our lives, we must safely deliver the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant out of here!” Long Junlin ordered with a roar.

“Protect the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant with our lives! Uphold the Dragon Clan’s honor!”

“Protect the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant with our lives! Uphold the Dragon Clan’s honor!”

“Protect the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant with our lives! Uphold the Dragon Clan’s honor!”

…

Long Junlin smiled at that sight. He knew that their Totem Dragon Clan was filled with fearless warriors. He looked toward the sky with determination in his eyes.

A visible passageway had appeared amidst the churning black aura in the sky. A silhouette could be seen at the end of the passageway—the demon monk.

The demon monk gazed at the crowd below and sneered, “Cultivators of the Totem Galaxy, I hope you have been faring well.”

“It’s the demon monk! He’s alive!!!”

An uproar broke out amidst the billions of cultivators.

They had heard about the atrocious deeds committed by the demon monk centuries ago, so how could they not be frightened by his reappearance? Many immediately attempted to escape from the cage.

“Gah!”

Pitiful cries followed.

The black chains that had sealed off the entire realm harnessed a suction force that pulled in those who dared to approach it and devoured them whole. With that, no one dared to approach the black chains anymore.

The remaining cultivators inside the cage were relieved that they hadn’t tried to escape, or else they would have been dead by now. Nevertheless, their foreheads remained tightly knitted, and some even burst out crying.

It was starting to dawn upon them what kind of situation they were in.

“Totem Dragon Clan, can’t you see that your people are already scared out of their wits? Shouldn’t you show yourself now?” the demon monk shouted as he thrust his palm down.

Boom!

A massive black hand manifested in the air, covering the entire sky. It harnessed immense destructive prowess that would kill everyone present should it land.

Shoosh!

A golden light rushed into the sky and struck the massive black hand, stopping it in place. Then, the golden light began to suffuse the black hand almost as if it was lightning traversing within it.

Boom!

With a loud explosion, the black hand dissipated amidst scattering golden light.

“Do not panic. I, Long Junlin, am here.”

A person rose into the air and stood opposite the demon monk. It was none other than Long Junlin.

With a tremor, countless rays of golden light rushed into the sky. Tens of millions of Totem Dragon Clansmen emerged from the ground and took their position behind Long Junlin.

Most notably, there were four figures standing alongside Long Junlin. One of them was Long Zhen.

“Lord Long Junlin and Lord Long Zhen are here…”

“Five of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors are here!”

The frightened crowd suddenly felt a sense of security upon seeing Long Junlin and the others. Cries of fear were swiftly replaced with cheers of joy.

The demon monk might be powerful, but he wasn’t a match for the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors. The cultivators of the Totem Galaxy had long heard about the story of how the demon monk was taken down by three of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors back then.

It was a shock that the demon monk was still alive, but this time around, he was up against five of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors. Back then, it had only taken three of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors to take him down.

On top of that, one of them was Long Junlin, one of the Three Masters of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors!

Thus, the crowd thought that the demon monk had made a miscalculation here. There was no way the demon monk would have dared to make a move if he knew that Long Junlin was here.

“I guess the Totem Dragon Clan doesn’t care that much about the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant. To think that they have only dispatched small fry here,” the demon monk sneered.

“Small fry?”

The crowd was stunned.

How could the demon monk have the guts to call the Totem Dragon Clan’s line-up ‘small fry’?

“Demon monk, how did you survive the ordeal back then?” Long Junlin asked.

“Curious? Kneel down and I’ll tell you,” the demon monk replied.

Boom!

Right after those words were spoken, a golden dragon charged toward the demon monk with a furious roar. It was Long Zhen. He couldn’t hold himself back and ended up making a move.

Long Zhen’s reputation wasn’t just for show. He had climbed to the position as one of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors with his own strength. The attack he had unleashed upon the demon monk was extremely powerful.

Pah!

Yet, with a casual wave of the demon monk’s hand, the golden dragon was smashed into smithereens amidst a pitiful cry.

The crowd was stunned. They couldn’t believe that the demon monk was able to overcome such an attack so easily. It finally struck them that the demon monk was far stronger than they had imagined.

“You are Long Mo’s son? Calm down, I’ll let you reunite with your father very soon,” the demon monk told Long Zhen.

Shoosh!

A golden light suddenly gushed forth from the Totem Dragon Clan’s army. It accurately struck the demon monk in the sky, knocking him into the depths of the black aura.

Long Junlin had made his move!

“Construct the formation!” the elder with yellow brows ordered.

The remaining four Nine Flags Dragon Warriors channeled their vast martial power to form a massive golden barrier over the sky, protecting everything beneath it.

Boom!

As soon as the martial power barrier was formed, a loud explosion could be heard from the depths of the black aura. The clash between the golden light and the black aura produced terrifying shockwaves.

“The Totem Dragon Clan is prioritizing the safety of their people?” Chu Feng murmured.

The power used to construct the massive golden barrier could have been instead used to augment Long Junlin’s fighting prowess. That would have boosted his chances against the demon monk. Yet, they chose to allow Long Junlin to confront the demon monk alone instead.

On one hand, this showed that they were confident in Long Junlin’s strength. On the other hand, this showed that the Totem Dragon Clan cared for their people.

“The demon monk clearly isn’t a good person. I hope that the Totem Dragon Clan wins the battle,” Long Xiaoxiao remarked with uneasy eyes.

Despite what they said earlier about watching a show, the devastating battle unfolding before them had left them in no mood to enjoy the delicacies spread out before them.

“The demon monk is no pushover. I doubt that Long Junlin will be able to swiftly take him down,” Liu Kuo said with a sigh.

While the three of them were focused on the battle in the sky, the white-haired woman continued cultivating with her closed eyes, as if what was happening had nothing to do with her.

“The Totem Dragon Clan might not be a match for the demon monk,” another woman’s voice sounded.

Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao, and Liu Kuo immediately turned over to take a look. The white-haired woman also opened her eyes too.

Another person had appeared in the forest. It was a woman enveloped in white light. It was impossible to make out her facial features, but she was emanating the aura of the Ancient Era.

It was the person whom they had met in the ancient palace back when they were taking the first test.

“Elder, you have finally appeared. Why did you summon us here?” Liu Kuo asked.

“I’m offering you a chance to survive,” the glowing woman said.

“Elder, are you saying that the Totem Dragon Clan isn’t a match for the demon monk?” Liu Kuo asked.

“That’s hard to say, but there’s a chance that the Totem Dragon Clan may fall in defeat. If the Totem Dragon Clan loses the battle, the casualties won’t be limited to just their clansmen,” the glowing woman replied.

After the lengths the demon monk had gone to sealing the Skydomain Lower Realm, it was hard to imagine that he would spare the other cultivators gathered here.

“Elder, did you bring us here in order to protect us?” Liu Kuo asked.

“No, this place won’t be enough to protect you either,” the glowing woman replied.

“But you mentioned that you brought us in here to give us a chance to survive?” Liu Kuo was confused.

“The four of you have cleared the test, so I’m bestowing a fortuitous encounter upon you that will help you survive the ordeal. However, you’ll have to obtain it with your own strength,” the glowing woman explained.

With a wave of her hand, she unleashed a wave of energy.

Boom!

The entire forest swayed in the face of the energy. Five towers began rising from the ground. These towers resembled the ones in the Trial of the Strongest, just that they were ten times larger. They looked much more imposing and inviolable.
