Chapter 4166 - Obliterating All

“Irredeemable bastards! If I’d known that you would not know repent I would’ve killed you all! I shouldn’t have allowed you to live till now!”

A voice sounded from beside Chu Feng.

It was not Chu Feng’s voice.

Looking in the direction of the voice, Chu Feng revealed a look of joy. A familiar figure had appeared beside him. It was Long Daozhi..

Long Daozhi was also the person that had seriously injured the eight of them.

“City Master Long, please spare us!”

“We were merely trying to scare Chu Feng. We never intended to actually kill him.”

Realizing that things had gone bad, the four leaders and four world spiritists all knelt and began to beg for forgiveness.

They’d given up on the idea of fleeing since Long Daozhi’s oppressive might had sealed off the region.

The only thing they could do now was beg for forgiveness.

“I can forgive your disrespectfulness towards me. However, to dare act disrespectful towards young friend Chu Feng, none of you shall live.”

As Long Daozhi spoke, he raised his hand and planned to send forth a palm strike to kill all eight of them.

“Senior Long, please wait.”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke to stop Long Daozhi.

Long Daozhi was surprised to hear Chu Feng stopping him.

The others were also shocked.

They hadn’t thought that Chu Feng would plead for leniency for them.

But, there was no reason for Chu Feng to plead for them. Could it be that Chu Feng was such a benevolent person?

However, to their utter surprise, Chu Feng said, “These people have quite strong cultivations. Their source energies will be very useful. Please remember to help me gather their source energies before killing them so that I can have Milady Queen use them when she awakens.”

It turned out that Chu Feng was not pleading for leniency for them. Rather, he only wanted to collect their source energy.

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, the eight people were so furious that they nearly vomited blood.

“Very well, we’ll do as young friend Chu Feng suggests.”

After saying those words, Long Daozhi’s palm struck down.

His martial power was like sickles and ferocious beasts as it struck the eight people, crushing them to pieces instantly. They had all been killed instantly.

After Long Daozhi retrieved his martial power, a spirit formation could be seen on each of his hands.

The spirit formations contained different things.

One spirit formation contained the treasures of the eight people.

As for the other spirit formation, it contained their source energies.

Long Daozhi’s intention was clear. He wanted to give all of them to Chu Feng.

“Senior, the items of those four world spiritists might be useful to me. So, I won’t hesitate to take them.”

“As for the other four, they’re your fellow clansmen. Perhaps their possessions might be useful to you. Thus, I won’t be keeping them.

“As for the source energies, I need to keep them for Milady Queen. Thus, I won’t hesitate to accept them too.”

Chu Feng put away the treasures of the four world spiritists and the eight source energies.

Long Daozhi accepted Chu Feng’s decision without any objection. He knew Chu Feng’s temperament, and knew that if Chu Feng didn’t want the four leaders’ possessions, he wouldn’t be able to force them on him.

Because of that, he kept the treasures of the four leaders.

“As the saying goes, one should return a gift upon receiving one.”

“Since I’ve accepted your gift, I should also return one in kind.”

“Senior, please have a look at this.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the Dragon Vein Source Stone.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you actually really managed to obtain the Dragon Vein Source Stone?”

Long Daozhi was so emotional upon seeing the Dragon Vein Source Stone that his body began to shiver.

Although emotional, he only took a single glance at the Dragon Vein Source Stone before hurriedly putting it away.

That Dragon Vein Source Stone was a treasure that could allow him to return to the Dragon Clan.

He had to handle it with extreme caution.

“Senior, I think that the knowledge of this place and the clues should be fake. I believe that there is only one Dragon Vein Source Stone here. The remaining three other Dragon Vein Source Stones simply do not exist,” said Chu Feng.

According to what Long Daozhi had told him, there should be four Dragon Vein Source Stones.

Chu Feng had obtained one. Logically, there should be three more.

But, Chu Feng had concluded that the other three Dragon Vein Source Stones did not exist.

“Young friend Chu Feng, why do you say that?”

Long Daozhi was rather confused by Chu Feng’s proclamation.

He felt that the people from the Dragon Clan wouldn’t have lied to them.

“I sensed the Dragon Vein Source Stone’s aura the moment I entered this place.”

“However, I only sensed the Dragon Vein Source Stone’s aura from a single location.”

“At the beginning I’d thought all four Dragon Vein Source Stones were located here.”

“But now I’ve found out that there’s only a single Dragon Vein Source Stone here.”

“Now that we’ve obtained this single Dragon Vein Source Stone, I no longer feel any Dragon Vein Source Stone’s aura anymore.”

“Because of this, I concluded that there shouldn’t be another Dragon Vein Source Stone here.”

“Of course there’s another possibility. That is, someone had obtained the other three Dragon Vein Source Stones before we came here.”

“But, I think that possibility is very slim.”

“After all, the Dragon Vein Source Stones are not so easily obtainable. Although we’ve entered the Endless Abyss a bit later than the rest, it’s only a bit later. Even if others had managed to discover the Dragon Vein Source Stones, they shouldn’t be able to retrieve them so quickly,” said Chu Feng.

“That would indeed be quite strange.”

“But, that doesn’t matter to us. After all, I only need a single Dragon Vein Source Stone to return to the Dragon Clan.”

“That said, it is all thanks to young friend Chu Feng today. Otherwise... I would have missed this Dragon Vein Source Stone.”

“I, Long Daozhi, owe young friend Chu Feng an enormous favor. I truly don’t know how to repay young friend Chu Feng for all that you’ve done,”

Gratitude filled Long Daozhi’s eyes as he said those words.

After all, returning to the Dragon Clan had been a dream throughout generations of people of his Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

It was all thanks to Chu Feng that they would be able to achieve this dream.

“Senior, you’ve saved my life, and you are my benefactor. There’s no need to mention some minor help like this.”

“That said, senior, how did you find this place? Could you have passed by this place by coincidence?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

Chu Feng felt that it would be understandable to say that he had encountered those eight people by coincidence.

But for Long Daozhi to also appear there, it would be too unreasonable to say that his appearance was also a coincidence.

“I was brought here by that strange tornado,” said Long Daozhi.

“Senior, were you inside that tornado the entire time or did you encounter another tornado afterwards?” asked Chu Feng.

“I encountered another one.”

“After being separated from you, I began searching for you. However, I was unable to find your whereabouts.”

“Not long afterward, I encountered that strange tornado again. When the tornado dispersed, I managed to sense your aura. Following that, I came here. It just so happened that I arrived at the exact time that those eight bastards tried to kill you.”

“Speaking of it, this is truly quite strange.”

“It seemed as if that tornado was deliberately sending me here to rescue you,” Long Daozhi also felt that things were too much of a coincidence.

“That’s true. That tornado is truly quite strange.” Chu Feng narrowed his brows. He entered a state of deep contemplation.

“Perhaps it is a coincidence. After all, with how vast this world is, nothing is too strange.”

“I’ve heard of stories where people encountered strangers that looked the same as their parents, and even had the same names,” said Long Daozhi.

“That’s true.” Chu Feng smiled upon hearing those words.

He felt what Long Daozhi had said was correct.

After all, regardless of whether or not that tornado might be a coincidence or some sort of hidden profound mystery, since it had helped them, it was something good.

“Young friend Chu Feng, do you know how to leave this place?” asked Long Daozhi.

Now that he had obtained a Dragon Vein Source Stone, Long Daozhi wanted to quickly leave and hand the Dragon Vein Source Stone to the Dragon Clan.

“Senior Long, you don’t have to worry about that. This place only seems dangerous, but it’s actually not that dangerous.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“As for leaving this place, the method is actually also very simple.”

“According to my observation, all of us will be teleported out of here once the time comes. Even if we wanted to stay we wouldn’t be able to,” said Chu Feng.

“How long must we wait?” asked Long Daozhi.

“It should be soon,” said Chu Feng.

“That’s good, that’s good.”

Long Daozhi was extremely happy.

Afterwards, they began to wait. Chu Feng and Long Daozhi did not chat excessively.

Chu Feng began to examine the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s blood-colored horsetail whisk.
