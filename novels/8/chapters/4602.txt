Chapter 4602: A Similar Trash

“That trash better pray that he doesn’t appear before me. Otherwise, I’ll obliterate him together with his entire clan.”

“How dare a weakling from the Holy Light Galaxy dare to provoke me? Does he not know how worthless he is? I shall make him regret his actions dearly!”

Those people cursed as they hurried along.

“Sigh! If not for that weakling provoking me, I wouldn’t have come in in the first place. Thinking about it, I guess I should thank that weakling after all. I’m not intending to proceed on to the next round, but if I could bring four keys out with me, I would be able to retain my honor and prove my own strength.

“I’ll be able to tell everyone that I entered the Incubation Forest, not for the chance to wed the daughter of the Wretched Demon, but to teach that trash who dares to run his mouth a lesson. In truth, I do have the strength to overcome the barrier.”

A slightly plump man amidst the group gestured to the four keys by his waist as he boasted gleefully.

“Brother, if you don’t intend on entering the barrier, why don’t you give your keys to me instead? Don’t let it go to waste!”

A pale-faced man who only had three keys on his waist told the slightly plump man.

“Give it to you? Why should I? I can still flaunt my strength if I bring them out with me, but what can I earn from giving them to you?” the slightly plump man replied disdainfully.

The pale-faced man was offended by those words, but he knew that he had it coming by asking for such a favor. So, he turned his head away with a harrumph instead of arguing things out.

“How foolish. Why do you even bother asking him to give it to you? In a place like this, you should just snatch it over!”

It was then that a voice sounded amidst the crowd.

“Snatch it over? Hahaha! Feel free to give it a try if you have the capability to do so. If you can snatch it from me, I’ll let you walk away with it!”

The slightly plump man hollered in the direction where the voice had come from, clearly infuriated by the remark. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Inciting others to steal his possessions was intolerable to him, even if it was meant as a joke. He turned his head over toward the voice, wanting to teach that person a lesson.

But astonishingly, he found himself unable to discern the one who spoke earlier!

And he wasn’t the only one facing this bizarre situation. There were over 13 of them present at the moment. Several of them were friends with one another, and the rest were just acquaintances they met along the way.

Yet, all 13 of them were looking around with confused looks on their faces. None of them actually knew who was the one who spoke earlier!

“Aren’t you talking bullshit? It’s obvious that the keys would be mine if I can snatch it over. Stop putting on an act of magnanimity to conceal your own uselessness.”

The voice sounded once more, but this time around, it sounded not from them but the forest ahead of them.

As soon as this voice sounded, the slightly plump man and the others in the group immediately began panicking. Judging from where the voice came from, the one who had just spoken wasn’t part of their group.

It was a coincidence that they met one another, but the truth was that they were gathering together in hopes of mitigating any dangers they faced along the way so that they could get out of here safely.

Yet, even though they had 13 people with them, a person still dared to confront them to steal their keys. This showed that the person was fairly powerful.

They felt their hearts clenching tightly, and some of them even had cold sweat trickling down their backs. They had a feeling that they might have encountered an enemy far beyond their means to deal with.

However, when they finally turned their gazes over to assess the person who had just spoken up, the unease on their faces immediately gave way to ravenous joy.

“The hell! I was still wondering who it is, but it turns out to be the trash from the Holy Light Galaxy!”

“Brat, you sure are brazen to dare appear before our faces! We came in here to teach you a lesson! If I allow you to leave with your life today, my name wouldn’t be Wang Yaoqing!”

“We shouldn’t be so merciful as to kill him outright. I want to torture him and make him suffer a fate worse than death!”

Upon seeing Chu Feng, the initially frightened crowd immediately morphed into ferocious beasts, looking as if they would grind his bones down and destroy him. There were even some who wanted him to suffer a fate worse than death!

Shoosh!

But all of a sudden, the figure standing before them suddenly vanished, and before they knew it, he was already standing in the middle of their group.

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng thrust his palm through the lower jaws of the slightly plump man, causing the latter to collapse onto the ground with a cry of agony.

What made this situation even eerier was that the cry of agony sounded a bit off. The others in the group quickly turned their gazes over, only to see a sight that gripped their hearts.

Chu Feng was grasping onto a bloodied object in his hand. If they weren’t seeing things, it was the slightly plump man’s tongue!

One must know that the slightly plump man was a world spiritist at rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation. Even though he wasn’t the strongest amongst them, there was none in the group who were much stronger than him.

This made them realize that the fellow that had come from the Holy Light Galaxy wasn’t trash but a demon from hell.

“We need to leave right now!!!”

Realizing that there was something amiss with the situation, the remaining 12 people immediately turned tail to flee.

Uwaaaa!

But before they could take more than a couple of steps, all of them suddenly recoiled back with a cry of agony.

As it turned out, there was an invisible wall blocking their way. They had run away with all their might earlier that they crashed forcefully into it, causing their head to bleed and nose to shatter.

“This strength... Rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation? You’re at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation?!”

The group finally understood why Chu Feng was able to defeat that slightly plump man so easily. It turned out that there was a huge disparity of strength sitting between them!

Even though Chu Feng wasn’t strong enough to match the three prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, there was no doubt that he was one of the top experts amongst the prodigies who had entered the Incubation Forest.

It was at this moment that they realized how foolish it was of a decision for them to enter this place and teach Chu Feng a lesson.

“Milord, please spare my life! Spare my life!”

“Here are all of my keys! I’m begging you, let me off this once!”

“I’ll give you all my keys too! Don’t kill me!”

The remaining 12 people frantically passed the keys they had over to Chu Feng before kneeling onto the ground to beg for their lives.

Even the slightly plump man endured the pain to climb to his knees and present his four keys to Chu Feng. Not only so, but he even raised his arms to slap his own cheeks as a symbol of repentance.

His face was already a complete mess from Chu Feng’s earlier strike, and his slapping only further mashed it all up.

Upon seeing this, the remaining 12 of them quickly followed the slightly plump man’s example to slap their own faces. In just a few moments, the smug faces that had sworn to teach Chu Feng a lesson earlier had all swollen up to the size of a pig’s head.

“So, these are the prodigies of the Nine Souls Galaxy? Nothing worthy of note at all,” Chu Feng sneered contemptuously.

He had expected such a situation from the very start.

Most cultivators shared a common trait—they played god before those weaker than them, only to lower themselves to the lowest of slaves before those stronger and more vicious than them.

It was the same no matter where he was, be it the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, Hundred Refinements Mortal World, Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, or this Nine Souls Galaxy.

It was true that the cultivators Chu Feng encountered were getting stronger and stronger, but their nature was all the same. Trash who oppressed the weak but feared the strong.
