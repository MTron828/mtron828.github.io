Chapter 4665: Threat of Eradication

Boom!

Upon realizing that the person was indeed no other than Xiao Yu, a powerful oppressive might immediately burst forth from the war chariot to seal off the space around Xiao Yu.

Following that, the members from the Gongsun Clan majestically marched out from the war chariot to encircle Xiao Yu.

“Xiao Yu, how dare you appear here? Where is Chu Feng? Spit it out! If you dare to conceal his whereabouts, we’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death!”

Instead of taking down Xiao Yu right away, they threatened her. If Xiao Yu couldn’t give them an answer they were satisfied with, there was no doubt that they would surely do as they had said.

“Heh...”

Yet, faced with the threat of the Gongsun Clan, Xiao Yu wasn’t intimidated at all. Instead, a disdainful smile crept onto her lips.

“How am I to know where Chu Feng is? Instead of caring about where Chu Feng is, I think you should worry for yourself first,” Xiao Yu replied with a sharp, menacing tone.

“Speak! Where is Chu Feng?!”

It was then that a silhouette stepped out of the war chariot. It was the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief.

He had already awoken a while ago, but he still looked extremely feeble, as if he had aged several decades. Upon stepping out of the war chariot, he raised his hand, and a powerful suction force immediately gushed forth like a tornado. He was intending to pull Xiao Yu into his grasp.

From the feral expression on his face, it was made plain obvious that Xiao Yu would definitely suffer greatly if she were to fall into his hands.

However, a bizarre twist in the situation occurred instead. When the powerful suction force was just about to reach Xiao Yu, it suddenly vanished without a trace, as if something had swallowed it whole.

It couldn’t reach its target at all!

“What happened?”

Those from the Gongsun Clan swiftly noticed that something was amiss upon seeing this. A frown formed on the forehead of the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief.

In the first place, it was weird that Xiao Yu suddenly appeared before them to stand in their way. However, out of deep hatred of Chu Feng, as well as the suspicion that Xiao Yu was just pulling an act of bravado here, the Gongsun Clan still chose to make its move in the end.

Unfortunately, the situation made it apparent that Xiao Yu had come prepared this time around.

“What haughty words from the Gongsun Clan!”

The area around Xiao Yu suddenly shook, and an elderly figure emerged from the crevices of space. Upon seeing this elderly figure, everyone in the Gongsun Clan felt their hearts sinking. Horror could be seen on each and every one of their faces.

“Paying respects to milord!!!”

Everyone in the Gongsun Clan immediately kneeled on the floor and kowtowed deeply. Even the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief was no exception either.

Panic was written all over their faces, making it look as if the world was coming to an end.

“Heh...”

Yet, despite the sheer formalities from the frightened Gongsun Clan, the elderly figure beside Xiao Yu only sneered coldly.

Boom!

An overpowering murderous intent burst forth, crushing down on the members of the Gongsun Clan.

“Milord, please spare our lives. We didn’t know that you were acquainted with this young hero! Had I known, we would have never dared to show any disrespect toward this young hero!”

Despite the overwhelming murderous intent directed toward them, there was not a single person in the Gongsun Clan who dared to turn tail and escape. It was not that they didn’t want to flee, but they knew that they didn’t stand a chance at all. So, they anxiously begged for mercy instead.

It was the only chance they had here.

“Heh... You cretins had the audacity to steal the Summoned Jadehearts. Even if I spare you, the others won’t. Gongsun Clan, resign yourself to your inevitable fate. This is the price of your greediness!” the elderly figure said with a chillingly impassive voice.

“Milord, please listen to my explanation. That young hero over there must have misunderstood. Our Gongsun Clan...”

The Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief was still desperately trying to find a way out of this situation.

Boom!

But before he could finish his words, a gush of oppressive might swept toward the Gongsun Clan like an invisible tsunami.

Gah!

Screams of agony sounded from wherever the oppressive might passed. It was time for the Gongsun Clan to suffer retribution for their actions.

...

An ancient teleportation formation was constructed in the midst of a field of flowers. This was the very same teleportation formation that the group from the Gongsun Clan had emerged from earlier.

All of a sudden, several figures flitted out from the teleportation formation.

They were all members of the Gonsun Clan. They had just accomplished their mission, and they were heading back to the Gongsun Clan to report in. In joyous mood from having succeeded in their undertaking, they chatted merrily with one another.

“H-huh? What is this?”

However, as soon as their eyes saw what was outside the teleportation formation, they jolted in fright. Blood swiftly drained from their faces as their knees caved in, sending them tumbling onto the ground.

“What in the world happened here?”

The merry mood amongst them immediately plunged into dread, and one of them even started crying out of fear.

What should have been a beautiful scenery of vibrant flowers was marred with cold corpses. There was a massive war chariot sitting at the center of the flowers.

It was the war chariot of the Gongsun Clan. The corpses lying all around were also familiar faces, fellow members of the Gongsun Clan. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

What made it even more chilling was that every single corpse here had died horrendously. Their eyeballs were flipped upward, and blood had flowed out from their seven apertures. If one were to take a close look, one would realize that every single one of their tendons had been snapped, and every inch of their bone had been ground into dust.

Nevertheless, their bodies were still largely intact, making it possible to discern their identities. However, that was also precisely what left these returning members of the Gongsun Clan absolutely horrified.

These corpses were actually the elites and prodigies of the Gongsun Clan. They were the group that had set off to the matchmaking convention so as to wed the Wretched Black Demon’s granddaughter, but why were they all dead here?

Of all places, they were massacred in the very territory of the Gongsun Clan!

“Lord Clan Chief! Lord Clan Chief isn’t amongst the corpses, but he had gone to the matchmaking convention too. He might still be alive...

“Q-quick! We need to return to the main city to report this matter to Lord Clan Chief.”

One of them quickly snapped out of their shock, and the other members of the Gongsun Clan quickly fumbled to their feet to soar into the air. However, perhaps out of extreme fright, some of them simply fell back to the ground, and there were a few who couldn’t rise to the sky either.

Only the one who spoke up first was a bit more resilient mentally. He quickly pulled his companions back to his feet and dragged them to the Gongsun Clan’s main city with him.

While the Gongsun Clan’s main city was termed as a city, it would be more accurate to call it a country. However, before they could even come close, the group had already noticed that something was amiss.

The usually bustling main city was deathly silent. As they approached a little closer, they swiftly noticed the stench of blood lingering in the air.

And when they entered the city, they ended up bursting into tears once more.

There were corpses strewn all over the main city too.

Some of them couldn’t take it anymore and fainted on the spot. A few of them fell to the ground on their knees and began bawling sorrowfully.

Only one person amidst the group was able to retain any semblance of rationality. He quickly headed toward the main hall, but he ended up halting before he could even come close. As if someone had stripped him of his powers, he suddenly fell to the ground.

Utter shock could be seen on his face as tears began to seep from his eyes.

“Our Gongsun Clan is over. Our Gongsun Clan is over! Just who could be so vicious to massacre our entire clan!!!”

That man roared in agony. His voice was filled with despair.

He saw a corpse hanging at the very top of the main hall. It was the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief.

There was a bloodied tablet tied to the body of the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief.

Greed heralds destruction!!!
