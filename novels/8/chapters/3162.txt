Chapter 3162 - Can Only Kneel

“That Chu Feng!!!”

When the crowd saw Chu Feng’s action, their expressions all changed.

This was especially true of the invited guests. They were looking at Chu Feng with expressions containing more than simple astonishment.

It was only at that moment that they realized that Chu Feng was not only astonishingly powerful in terms of martial strength, but he was actually also an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

With his strength, he would not only be capable of killing others using his martial power, but he would also be able to heal his injuries by setting up formations. Furthermore, he had attained such high accomplishments in terms of both martial cultivation and world spirit techniques. With this, they were incapable of not being astonished.

They finally realized what sort of existence Chu Xuanyuan’s son was.

In fact, even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present were overflowing with emotions. They were simply unable to calm themselves. Chu Feng had completely refreshed their recognition of their clansmen.

Before Chu Feng, they had never imagined that there would be such a heaven-defying existence that would appear among their Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

Currently, in their hearts, Chu Feng was no longer only a powerful individual that happened to be their clansman. Instead, he became their hope, a hope that would lead them out of the valley and bring them to the summit.

After some time, Chu Feng finally stopped setting up his spirit formation, and suddenly opened his clenched hand.

Once he opened his hand, golden light began to shine brightly. Upon closer inspection, one would actually see many golden bodies of light that resembled medicinal pellets. They looked very beautiful.

However, if one was to pay close attention, one would turn pale with fright. More or less, one would become afraid.

The reason for that was because one would notice upon closer inspection that those golden bodies of light each contained a living creature.

Those were bugs. The bugs were very small, yet very disgusting. Furthermore, they appeared to be very fierce-looking. Being inside the bodies of light, they gave off a very uneasy sensation. One could tell from a single glance that they were no simple bugs.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng raised his arm, and the bodies of light that he held in his hand shot into the bodies of the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen like arrows.

Those bugs had not merely entered the bodies of the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen; they had entered their souls.

“You... what are you doing?”

At that moment, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were all deeply frightened.

They were no fools. They could tell that what had entered their bodies were most definitely not good.

“What’s this? Are you all dissatisfied with my gift to you?” Chu Feng’s gaze was once again filled with murderous desire.

“No, of course not, of course not.”

Seeing Chu Feng’s expression, how could the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen possibly dare contradict him?

“I will ask you all this then, do you like my gift?” Chu Feng asked.

“We do, we love it,” the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen nodded repeatedly. However, they seemed like they wanted to cry.

“It’s good that you do,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Young master Chu Feng is truly amazing. As expected of Lord Chu Xuanyuan’s descendant.”

“Young master Chu Feng, I am...”

Right at that moment, the guests invited over by the Burnfield Monstrous Clan all walked toward Chu Feng with eager and attentive smiles on their faces.

After witnessing Chu Feng’s strength, they all wanted to befriend him.

However, Chu Feng completely ignored their kind regards. Instead, he raised his hand and shot a fist toward the sky.

The next moment, muffled explosions began to be heard. All of the Burnfield Monstrous Clan’s banners inside the main city were destroyed.

Following that, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and new banners were placed onto the places where the Burnfield Monstrous Clan’s banners were previously planted. Those were all the Chu Heavenly Clan’s banners.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s expression became incomparably grave. He ran his eyes across the crowd. Then, with a voice many times more resounding than thunder, he said, “From today on, this place is our Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.”

“Those who are not of our Chu Heavenly Clan, unless invited to come to this land by our clan... shall scram immediately.”

“This...”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the Burnfield Monstrous Clan’s guests were stunned. This was especially true for those that had walked over to Chu Feng’s side; they felt very embarrassed.

Chu Feng’s words were clearly spoken to them.

“What’s this? Did you all not understand my words?”

Chu Feng deliberately looked to the people invited by the Burnfield Monstrous Clan as he said those words.

Furthermore, after Chu Feng said those words, an ice-cold expression appeared in his eyes.

At that moment, how could those people possibly dare to hesitate? Without daring to utter a single fart, they immediately soared into the sky and left.

Seeing that, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen also soared into the sky with the intention to leave.

Even though they had submitted themselves to Chu Feng, it was because they were forced to do so. If the opportunity presented itself, they would naturally attempt to escape from Chu Feng’s evil clutches.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, right after the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen soared into the sky, they immediately lost their ability to fly, and fell to the ground in succession.

“Eeahhh~~~”

Upon landing, they grabbed their chests and began to scream miserably in pain.

“Who told you all to fly into the sky? Since you are my slaves, you will not be allowed to fly within my territory. All of you... kneel, and crawl!” Chu Feng spoke loudly.

Hearing those words, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen immediately crawled back up and kneeled on the ground.

To their surprise, upon kneeling, the enormously miserable sensation of pain actually disappeared.

At that moment, they realized that it must have been caused by the bugs that Chu Feng forcibly put into their bodies.

“Scram!” Chu Feng shouted.

The next moment, the people from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan, including Fenye Ganghao, all began to quickly crawl out of the main city.

Upon exiting the city, there were immediately people that stood up and attempted to fly.

However, the moment they stood up, that enormous pain immediately filled their entire body again.

It turned out that they would only be able to kneel and crawl on the ground in the future They would not be able to stand up again, because they would feel that enormous pain the moment they did.

This scene was witnessed by the guests they had invited.

Seeing the insufferably arrogant Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen ending up in such a tragic state, they sighed in their hearts at how ruthless Chu Feng was, and made a firm resolution to never make the Chu Heavenly Clan an enemy in the future, or else what had happened to the Burnfield Monstrous Clan would likely happen to them someday.

“Little brother Chu Feng, you are simply too amazing.”

“My little brother Chu Feng, how could you be this powerful at such a young age? I am truly in admiration.”

“Our Chu Heavenly Clan is saved now. From this point on, who would dare to bully our Chu Heavenly Clan again?”

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen were endlessly excited.

It was only at that moment that they became certain that it was correct to choose to follow Chu Feng.

They were acting as if they’d seen light, and were filled with confidence toward their future.

However, only Chu Feng knew that their future would not be smooth at all.
