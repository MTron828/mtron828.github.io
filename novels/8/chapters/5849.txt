Chapter 5850: Power Beyond My Limits

Chu Feng wasn’t slacking around while the Immemorial Hero’s Sword was slaughtering the Ancient Era’s clansmen. He began constructing a formation. Just as all of the Ancient Era’s clansmen died, he finished his formation.

A powerful formation enveloped the surrounding area.

At the same time, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was watching the situation at Chu Feng and Old Man Compliance’s side via the protective formation. She saw how Chu Feng slaughtered millions of Ancient Era’s clansmen invading their Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

She also knew that Chu Feng had sealed off the black light spirit formation gate before making his way to the battlefield, and that put her heart at ease. Her lips curled up in relief.

“What happened, Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster?” the Holy Master asked.

This was the first time she had smiled since the invasion of the Ancient Era’s clans. Furthermore, her smile had many different emotions behind it.

“Why don’t you take a look?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said with a grand wave of her hand.

At the same time, the mirror-like formation cores that towered in the skies of the realms in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy projected the real-time situation over on Chu Feng’s side.

The crowd trembled upon seeing the scene.

There was no gravity in space, so everything floated freely in place. The scene that unfolded before the crowd’s eyes looked as if it had come from hell. Even those who had participated in massacres before felt goosebumps.

There were so many corpses and blood that they formed an ocean. At least from the projection, this tragic scenery stretched to the horizon. At the center of the scene was a young man and an old man, with their backs against the crowd.

“Chu Feng?”

Quite a few people recognized Chu Feng even from his backview, though the majority of the people still weren’t sure. What they were more curious about, however, was the huge number of casualties around.

It was then that the voice of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was relayed to all realms via the protective formation. “Our protective formation was breached earlier, and our enemies sent in millions of cultivators and world spiritists to invade us. There were pinnacle Half-God level cultivators amidst them.”

The crowd was horrified. A rank Half-God level was as good as a god to them, let alone pinnacle Half-God level cultivators. None of them had the strength to stop them.

However, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster continued speaking, “At this critical moment, Chu Feng and Old Man Compliance, who previously left our home to explore other galaxies, returned and slaughtered the millions of invaders who dared trespass on our land.

“In particular, Chu Feng channeled the power of the formation core, found the weakness of the enemy’s spirit formation gate, and sealed it off. He resolved the crisis we were facing.”

Only then did the crowd realize how precarious of a situation they had been in. It was fortunate they had Chu Feng around. He had saved the Ancestral Martial Galaxy and all of them.

“Good job, Brother Chu Feng!”

“Chu Feng! Chu Feng! Chu Feng!”

In the formation core realm, Long Tianhui was the first to start chanting Chu Feng’s name, and the others followed suit. The same happened in the other realms too.

The loudest chants came from the realm where the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and the others were. Their voices were so loud that it shook the sky. This was the scene that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster had wanted to see.

She had refrained from showing the sight of the Ancient Era’s clansmen breaching their protective formation because she knew it would only lower their morale and leave them in despair. Even though the invaders had been reduced to corpses, there was still a panic when the crowd learned that some of them were pinnacle Half-God level cultivators.

Half-God level cultivators might not be anything much to the other galaxies, but they were intimidating existences to those in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Had she shown the sight of them breaching their protective formation to the crowd, it would have stripped the fighting will out of them.

It was also for a similar reason she was doing this now. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This was an opportunity to build up a hero for their Ancestral Martial Galaxy. The goal was not just to boost Chu Feng’s reputation but to use his accomplishments to boost the morale of the people so that they would be more motivated to channel the protective formation.

“Everyone, the fight to protect our homeland isn’t over yet. Chu Feng and Old Man Compliance are doing their part. We must do our part too. The Ancestral Martial Galaxy is our shared home. Regardless of how strong you are, your contribution is vital to ensuring our survival!” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

Those words evoked loud cheers. Despite having expended a lot of their strength, the crowd continued to channel the formation with even greater fervor than before.

...

“What’s wrong, young friend Chu Feng?” Old Man Compliance asked.

It had been some time since Chu Feng slayed the Ancient Era’s clansmen, but he continued staring at the scene in front of him in a daze.

Old Man Compliance also noticed that Chu Feng’s formation was no ordinary sealing formation, but he couldn’t tell exactly what kind of formation it was.

“It’s nothing much.” Chu Feng shook his head.

It was something important but he didn’t think it would be meaningful to tell Old Man Compliance.

He had sealed off the black light spirit formation gate’s cultivation cap, so the Ancient Era’s clans wouldn’t be able to send anyone stronger than pinnacle Half-God level.

What he was concerned about now were the runes on the intruders’ bodies. These runes allowed the pinnacle Half-God level cultivators from the Ancient Era’s clans to temporarily raise their cultivation to True God level, though the price they had to pay for that was death.

He noticed that the runes harnessed another surge of energy that would fuse with the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation. He was unable to stop this fusion from happening, and he couldn’t tell what the effects of this fusion too.

The first group of Exalted level cultivators had formed hand seals to fuse the energy into the protective formation. However, Chu Feng subsequently realized that the surge of energy would still discreetly flow into the protective formation upon their death.

He tried to stop it via a formation, but it was to no avail. He tried to examine the situation close-up with his Heaven’s Eyes too, but that didn’t work.

This energy was beyond his comprehension.

He wouldn’t be too bothered if he was alone, but behind him were the countless lives of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. This greatly unnerved him.
