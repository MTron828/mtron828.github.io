Chapter 2608 - Definitely Fishy

“Chu Feng, you are simply too amazing. You actually managed to even clear the Unknown Burial Ground.”

“Chu Feng, exactly what sort of treasures did you obtain from the Unknown Burial Ground?”

“Chu Feng, do you know who it is that created that Unknown Burial Ground? Why did he create the Unknown Burial Ground?”

After a moment of astonishment, the crowd started to batter Chu Feng with a torrential storm of questions.

Although they now knew that the Unknown Burial Ground had collapsed because Chu Feng had obtained its treasures, they still had a lot of questions that they wished to ask.

“Everyone, it’s enough. It was no easy task for Chu Feng to defeat the formation. Let’s give him some time to rest.”

Right at this moment, Ying Mingchao waved his sleeve. A layer of spirit power emerged, isolating Chu Feng from the others.

At this moment, only seven individuals were present in that layer of spirit power.

They were Chu Feng, Zhao Hong, the guardian clan’s clan chief, Kong Shunlian, Kong Yuehua, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi.

At this moment, Ying Mingchao had a serious expression on his face. Everyone thought that Ying Mingchao was planning to say something. However, who would’ve thought that Ying Mingchao actually bowed to Chu Feng. Then, in a very apologetic manner, he said, “Chu Feng, my apologies. I have let you down.”

“Senior Ying, what are you doing?” Chu Feng hurriedly moved forward to support Ying Mingchao.

“The method that we used to break through the Life and Death Formation was wrong. Yet, I still made you do it. If it wasn’t for the fact that you managed to have a sudden flash of realization and decided to use the comprehension that you obtained from the illusion, we would most likely have caused your death,” Ying Mingchao said.

“Chu Feng, I am truly sorry,” Even Zi Xunyi started to apologize to Chu Feng remorsefully.

“Seniors, you must not act like this. Actually, the methods that you two used to break through the Life and Death Formation were most definitely effective. Else, how could the two of you be able to leave it?” Chu Feng said.

Even though he knew that their method was wrong, he did not wish to attack their egos. Since the Unknown Burial Ground was already gone, regardless of whether their method was effective or not, no one would be able to attempt to pass through the Unknown Burial Ground using their method anyways.

“Chu Feng, you don’t have to comfort us. We are able to imagine what happened,” However, regardless of what Chu Feng said, Ying MIngchao seemed to be determined that their method was incorrect.

That was understandable. After all, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were grand characters that had experienced a lot of things. As such, how could they not be able to tell?

In fact, it was not only Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi. Many of the people present were all able to tell that Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi’s method was wrong.

Even if their method wasn’t wrong, it would still not be as authentic as Chu Feng’s method.

Else, why would the Unknown Burial Ground disappear after Chu Feng successfully broke through the Life and Death Formation, and remain after Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi broke through the Life and Death Formation?

The only reason no one mentioned it directly was because they were concerned for Ying Mingchao’s reputation. However, they all already knew the truth in their hearts.

“That is not important. As long as Chu Feng and Zhao Hong are fine, everything’s good,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“That’s right, it’s good that they’re fine,” Zi Xunyi voiced her agreement.

Although she felt that she had made a mistake, she did not wish for Ying Mingchao to endure too much of a mental burden.

“Zhao Hong’s cultivation has actually already reached the True Immortal realm. It would seem that the harvest this time is truly great,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.

“This cultivation was given to me by Chu Feng,” Zhao Hong said.

“Oh?”

The people present were startled by those words. However, after seeing Zhao Hong’s ashamed expression, they soon managed to guess what had happened.

The person to clear the Unknown Burial Ground should be Chu Feng. As for Zhao Hong, she should have only been saved by Chu Feng. As for her cultivation, since she said it like that, they were able to guess what had happened.

“Let’s move on to proper business. Chu Feng, there’s good news. We have managed to discover the Infant Soul Sect’s hideout,” Ying Mingchao said.

“Truly?” Chu Feng was immediately overjoyed upon hearing those words.

“This is all thanks to you. If it wasn’t for you capturing those disciples from the Infant Soul Sect, we would not have been able to find out where they were located this quickly,” Ying Mingchao said.

“In that case, when do we act?” Chu Feng asked. He was more impatient than anyone to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect.

After all, the Infant Soul Sect had done all sorts of evil. They were a sect that trained using infants. If they were eliminated a day sooner, it would mean that they would be able to save the people of the world, as well as those innocent children, a day sooner.

“This matter should not be delayed. We plan to set off immediately,” Ying Mingchao said.

Then, Ying Mingchao removed the spirit formation. He informed the crowd of his desire to attack the Infant Soul Sect.

Actually, Ying Mingchao had already mentioned this matter to the various powers beforehand. He had also obtained the endorsement of those powers.

And now, as they knew the location of the Infant Soul Sect, they would naturally agree with Ying Mingchao’s decision without any objections. The crowd planned to immediately set off toward the Infant Soul Sect’s headquarters.

“Are we able to lay down our grudges?” After gaining the approval of the crowd, Ying Mingchao especially turned toward Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua.

“Let’s eliminate our great enemy first,” Kong Shunlian said.

“Very well.”

Seeing that they’d agreed, Ying Mingchao nodded with a smile on his face. At this moment... they really did need Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua’s strength.

However, most importantly of all, Ying Mingchao truly wanted to reconcile with them.

“Xunyi, you...” Ying Mingchao looked to Zi Xunyi.

Ying Mingchao was extremely worried for Zi Xunyi. He was afraid that Zi Xunyi would leave him, that she would try to kill herself again.

With his understanding of Zi Xunyi, Ying Mingchao knew that it would be very difficult to change what she had decided. Ying Mingchao truly did not wish for Zi Xunyi to die just like that.

“The Infant Soul Sect is the greatest scourge in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. There is nothing more important than eliminating them,” Zi Xunyi said.

“Xunyi, you’re willing to help me?”

Ying Mingchao was immediately overjoyed upon hearing what Zi Xunyi said. He was not overjoyed because Zi Xunyi was willing to help him. Rather, it was because this would, at the very minimum, meant that Zi Xunyi would continue to stay with him. With that, he would be able to find an opportunity to persuade Zi Xunyi against killing herself.

“No, it’s not to help you. Rather, it’s for all the living things in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Zi Xunyi said.

“Very well. Xunyi, what you’ve said is very true. This battle is unrelated to us individually. Instead, it concerns the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”

“Everyone, let us battle for all the living things in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm!” Ying Mingchao shouted.

“Battle for all the living things in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm!!!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The crowd shouted in unison. Their voices were like a tsunami, a gathering of ten thousand thunderbolts, that echoed through the entire desert.

“Ji, ji, ji~~~”

Right when Ying Mingchao was planning to lead everyone to attack the Infant Soul Sect’s headquarters, several birds emitting blue light began to fly toward this place from all directions.

Those birds were very special. Not only were they extremely fast, but they were also flickering, as if they were teleporting.

In the end, these birds arrived in the sea of people.

These birds were called Bluelight Flickering Birds. They were a sort of method to transmit information. They were similar to the Golden Flash Bird. Merely, their speed was faster than the Golden Flash Bird.

“Lord City Master,” Upon receiving the news from the Bluelight Flickering Birds, an elder of Hero City revealed a serious expression.

“Could it be that something has happened in the city?” Ying Mingchao knew that those Bluelight Flickering Birds were sent from Hero City.

“News has come from the city that the Infant Soul Sect has sent out invitations. They are inviting everyone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to their headquarters to participate in a grand ceremony,” That elder said.

“Grand ceremony? What grand ceremony?” Many people present revealed surprised expressions after hearing that.

The Infant Soul Sect had always been extremely well-hidden and low-key. In fact, apart from the tier one powers, very few people knew of their existence.

Yet, now this Infant Soul Sect actually made such an open invitation. The crowd felt extremely astonished by their behavior.

“They say that it’s a cultivation grand ceremony that can help everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm increase their cultivation,” That elder said.

“In that case, does the invitation have the location of the Infant Soul Sect’s headquarters?” Ying Mingchao asked.

“It does. It is the same as the location that we’ve obtained,” That elder answered.

“Could it be that everyone else has also received this information?” Ying Mingchao turned to the crowd.

He knew that, apart from Hero City, the other powers had also received information sent to them through the Bluelight Flickering Birds.

“City Master Ying, that is precisely the case,” The people from the various powers that had received information from their various Bluelight Flickering Birds all spoke in unison.

“Infant Soul Sect, exactly what are they planning?” At this moment, Ying Mingchao started to ponder.

He had originally thought that he would be able to catch the Infant Soul Sect unprepared after obtaining the location of their headquarters from Old Demon Rakshasa.

However, with the situation now, they were evidently unable to take the Infant Soul Sect by surprise. Since the Infant Soul Sect dared to invite everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to their headquarters, they must have made preparations.

“Lord City Master, what should we do now?” The crowd asked.

“This matter is definitely fishy. We cannot be careless.”

“Let’s return to Hero City first. We shall make a decision as to what to do after I discuss this matter with the various headmasters.”

After making that decision, Ying Mingchao lead the crowd back toward Hero City.

At the same time, the people from the Immortal Sword School, Buddha’s Heavenly Temple and the other powers also transmitted this news to their respective headmasters. They planned to gather at Hero City.

After this vast group of people left, the six characters that filled the sky also started to gradually vanish. Soon, this desert was once again covered with wind and sand.

The desert had returned to how it was before.

However, suddenly, two figures appeared in the sky above the vast desert.

One of them was that yellow-gowned old man. As for the other, it was that deer.

Like an ordinary deer, that deer stood beside the yellow-gowned old man. However, its eyes were filled with spirit. From that, one could tell that it was no ordinary deer.

At this moment, both the yellow-gowned old man and the deer were staring at the direction that Chu Feng and the others had left in. No one knew what they were thinking.
