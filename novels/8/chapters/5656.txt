Chapter 5656: Heavenly King of Massacre is in Third Place

“Does that mean you’re really Lord Jie Ranqing’s son?” Fu Xing was astonished.

“Yes, the famous Jie Ranqing is my mother,” Chu Feng replied with a proud expression. He even brandished the Purpledemon Dagger as if worried that Fu Xing wouldn’t believe him.

He didn’t think that there was any need to lie here.

Fu Xing was initially taken aback, but she soon replied with a nod, “It makes sense that you’re stronger than me if you’re Lord Jie Ranqing’s son.”

The two of them had consumed the black fruit, but Chu Feng’s imprint was somehow darker than hers. Evidently, she had lost to Chu Feng in the combat test, though she wasn’t too upset by the results.

She did contribute to the victory too, but it was clear that Chu Feng had played a more crucial role than her.

“I’m guessing you aren’t from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? Otherwise, you wouldn’t have to put your life on the line here for a Saint-tier treasure. Heck, you wouldn’t even have been bullied by a power of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s caliber!” Fu Xing said.

Chu Feng first flashed a complicated smile before saying, “I don’t have any ties with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion even though my mother is Jie Ranqing.”

“It seems like the rumor is true,” Fu Xing remarked.

“What did you hear?” Chu Feng asked.

“We’re considered friends, right?”

“Of course. We have just overcome a life-and-death situation together.”

“Then I shan’t hold back and get straight to the point. I heard an extremely discreet and confidential rumor that no one dares to spread around.”

“Go ahead,” Chu Feng urged her to carry on.

“I heard that Lord Jie Ranqing isn’t in closed-door training; in truth, she is being imprisoned by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion for having committed a grievous mistake,” Fu Xing said.

“What grievous mistake is it?”

“It’s said that she got together with someone outside the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and they even had a child together. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has always been of the stance that everyone outside is trash, and that they had to marry within in order to preserve their superior bloodlines. Lord Jie Ranqing possesses the legendary Ruler’s Bloodline, which the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion views with grave importance.

“Naturally, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was infuriated when they learned that Lord Jie Ranqing got together with an outsider and even had a child with him. They felt that her bloodline had been sullied, and they wanted her to kill that man and that child. However, Lord Jie Ranqing paid no heed to that unreasonable request. In fact, she even predicted their demands and sent her child somewhere safe in advance. She refused to divulge any information about that child, which was why she was imprisoned,” Fu Xing said.

Most people would have found those words ridiculous, but Chu Feng only felt stabbing pain in his chest, for he knew that it was the truth. He couldn’t imagine just how much pressure his mother must have faced from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion in order to protect him.

Fu Xing noticed the changes in Chu Feng’s emotions. In particular, she sensed a faint but absolutely terrifying killing intent from him.

“It looks like the rumor is true. Rest assured, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion will regret their folly. You’re the strongest world spiritist junior in the world of cultivation. I can say with certainty that you did not sully Lord Jie Ranqing’s bloodline. There’s not a single prodigy in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who can compete with you,” Fu Xing said.

She could imagine how stressed Jie Ranqing must have been to be forced to turn against her clan back then, but she thought that Chu Feng carried a heavier burden. He was already placed on the blacklist of the strongest power in the world of cultivation from the moment he was born. Even though his mother was strong, she didn’t have the power to protect him.

How arduous must his journey have been?

“It has been tough on you Chu Feng,” Fu Xing suddenly remarked.

Those words were blurted out in the spur of the moment. She could imagine the effort he had to put in and the sacrifices he had to make to come this far. It had been the same for her too. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, Chu Feng suddenly flashed a brilliant smile and said, “It wasn’t tough at all. No one has it easy in this world.”

Fu Xing was initially taken aback. She thought that someone who knew about his background and struggled so much from a young age shouldn’t possibly be capable of smiling so radiantly, and that only made her even more impressed with him. She was awed by his mental resilience.

Thus, she replied with an equally radiant smile, “Indeed.”

“Let’s go,” Chu Feng said.

“Where to?”

“Let’s peer into the true secret of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.”

Fu Xing’s interest was piqued, so she quickly followed him.

…

There was a peculiar place in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain that was enveloped by a layer of thick but resplendent seven-colored fog.

A black humanoid figure walked in this fog. The aura he emanated was no longer that of a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist but something towering above that of a True Dragon World Spiritist. His imposing disposition made one feel like he was the ruler of this world.

Yet, he walked carefully without the slightest hint of arrogance till he arrived before a cliff. Beneath the cliff was a seemingly bottomless abyss.

He bowed before the cliff and said, “Milord, someone has cleared the test.”

The world shook as soon as those words were spoken. This tremor came not from the black humanoid figure but the stronger existence lying dormant inside the abyss. Two humongous, blood-red eyes reminiscent of full moons appeared inside the abyss. The pupils were so far apart that the existence must have been larger than an Upper Realm.

“Is it those brats named Chu Feng and Fu Xing?” a deep but resonant voice echoed from the abyss.

“Milord, strictly speaking, it’s Chu Feng who has cleared the test,” the black humanoid figure said.

“You’re the one who administered the test. Who do you think is stronger, Chu Feng or the lad who called himself the Heavenly King of Massacre back then?”

“Milord, I believe that Chu Feng is stronger. In fact, I think the Heavenly King of Massacre is only ranked third among the juniors who have entered our Nine Heavens Secret Domain.”

“Oh?”

“You’re saying that Chu Feng is in the first place, whereas Fu Xing is in the second palace? That brat who entered this place back then is only ranked third?”

“Milord, I don’t believe Fu Xing is on par with the brat named the Heavenly King of Massacre. The one whom I think is in second place is that lass from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion back then.”
