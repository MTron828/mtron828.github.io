Chapter 3885 - Accepting The Inheritance

“Sure enough, it is enticing to you.”

“However, to this old man, this would be the actual treasure.”

Right at that moment, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor turned around and looked to the giant sword on his back.

Then, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor removed the giant sword from his back. His intimate gaze was filled with sentiment. It was as if that sword was not a sword at all, but instead his old friend.

“This sword is called the Monster Slaying Sword. It has followed this old man for many years. It is by relying on this sword that this old man managed to move about the Ancestral Martial Galaxy unhindered,” said the Great Monster Slayer Emperor as he gently caressed the enormous sword.

“Ancestral Martial Galaxy?”

Chu Feng let out a gasp uncontainably after hearing the name ‘Ancestral Martial Galaxy.’

He actually knew that the galaxy that they belonged to was originally called the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

It was only later on when the Ancestral Martial Galaxy ended up being ruled by the Holy Light Clan that it was renamed the Holy Light Galaxy.

This Great Monster Slayer Emperor stated that he had moved about unhindered in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy instead of the Holy Light Galaxy. From this, it could be seen that he had been alive a truly long time ago.

At the very least, his time was still a time when the Holy Light Galaxy did not rule the starfield.

It was no wonder that the Mystic Cave Saints had stated that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was one of the most powerful existences after the Ancient Era.

Hearing Chu Feng’s gasp, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor spoke profoundly, “This old man knows that the Ancestral Martial Galaxy has changed its name to the Holy Light Galaxy.”

“Senior, you knew?”

Chu Feng was rather surprised to hear that. After all, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor had died a long time ago.

However, soon, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. Although the Great Monster Slayer Emperor had died for many years, this remnant soul of his seemed to have survived through special means.

Over the years, there had been many people that came to the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.

Thus, it was reasonable for him to possess knowledge of the changes that had occurred outside.

“There have been many people that came to the tomb over the years. Thus, this old man naturally knows about the changes that happened outside,” said the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.

Sure enough, Chu Feng had guessed correctly. The Great Monster Slayer Emperor had learned about the outside world from the outsiders that had visited the tomb

“That said, this old man is rather surprised by the fact that the Holy Light Clan was able to gain their current success. After all, at that time, there were a lot of powerful clans. The Holy Light Clan was still weak by comparison.”

“Likely, an extraordinary younger generation must’ve appeared in the Holy Light Clan later on,” said the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.

“Senior, this junior has a question,” Chu Feng said suddenly.

“Ask away,” said the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.

“What is going on with the Ancient Era’s organisms located below?”

“Could there be some sort of reason why you’ve chosen to establish your tomb here?”

“Or could it be that those Ancient Era’s organisms are also seeking senior’s inheritance?”

“Is that why they’ve decided to deliberately stay beneath senior’s tomb?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was particularly curious about those Ancient Era’s organisms.

The reason for that was all because of Yan Ruyu.

A mural greatly resembling Yan Ruyu had appeared in the cave where those Ancient Era’s organisms resided.

Chu Feng had also seen the remnant soul of Yan Ruyu in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb. That image had even been calling for his help.

Thinking back, Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan had all disappeared in the Misty Peak’s forbidden area.

There were also powerful existences from the Ancient Era inside the Misty Peak .

Back then, Chu Feng had suspected before that their disappearance might be related to the Ancient Era’s organisms.

And now, Chu Feng felt even more suspicion that their disappearance might be related to those Ancient Era’s organisms.

However, Chu Feng knew very little about those Ancient Era’s organisms.

Thus, he could only ask the Great Monster Slayer Emperor for knowledge.

Even though the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was merely a remnant soul, and was also born after the Ancient Era, he had been in that place the entire time. Furthermore, his protective formation utilized those Ancient Era’s organisms.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor must have some sort of understanding of them.

“Are you asking about those survivors from the Ancient Era?” asked the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.

“Survivors?”

Chu Feng realized that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor most definitely had a certain amount of understanding of the Ancient Era’s organisms.

“Actually, those Ancient Era’s survivors are the true masters of this place.”

“I am merely someone who came later. As for the reason why I established my tomb here, it’s because this old man wanted to use his own consciousness to personally select the younger generation that would inherit my Great Monster Slaying Sword.”

“But, how could a remnant soul continue to exist forever?”

“Even for methods to prolong the existence of one’s remnant soul, one’s spirit body, special power would be needed to make it happen.”

“As for this place, it just so happens to possess that sort of power. It is also that power that allowed those Ancient Era’s survivors to take root here.”

“That said, you must not attempt to seek out that power, because that is not a power that you can touch.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The reason why this old man is able to utilize that power is because I made a contract with them. However, they will definitely not allow you to touch that power. You will only bring death upon yourself should you attempt to do so,” warned the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.

“They seem to be very powerful, and are major threats.”

“Senior, will they continue to remain here? Will they become a threat to this era’s martial cultivators?” asked Chu Feng.

“Who could possibly know about that sort of thing? I’m not them.”

“The topic of the conversation seems to have shifted quite far.”

As the Great Monster Slayer Emperor spoke, he once again turned his gaze to the enormous Great Monster Slaying Sword he held in his hand.

He seemed to not want to chat about those Ancient Era’s organisms anymore.

“This sword of mine had a soul. Unfortunately, its soul died alongside me.”

“This sword no longer possesses the might it did back then. It’s only a housing now.”

“However, to me, it is still my most precious treasure. It is also my true inheritance.” The Great Monster Slayer Emperor looked to the giant sword in his hand.

From the tone of his words, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor truly had deep sentiments for that sword.

However, what Chu Feng was more interested in knowing at that moment were matters regarding Yan Ruyu.

“Senior, this junior did not intend to change the topic.”

“I also do not have any intention to disrespect senior.”

“Merely, when this junior first received senior’s spirit power trial, I saw the remnant soul of a friend of mine.”

“She pleaded for my help. I think that her plea is related to those Ancient Era’s organisms located deep underground.”

“Senior, as you’ve been here the entire time, have you encountered my friend?” asked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng felt that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor must’ve been examining all the trials he had gone through.

Thus, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor must’ve also seen everything he saw. Because of that, Chu Feng felt that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor must’ve seen Yan Ruyu too.

“My apologies, young friend. This old man will not involve himself in your personal business, and will also not give you indications.”

“You will have to walk your own path. If you have questions, you should go and seek out the answers yourself.”

“As for now, you should accept this old man’s inheritance.”

After the Great Monster Slayer Emperor said those words, Chu Feng realized that he would not tell him anything more about the Ancient Era’s organisms.
