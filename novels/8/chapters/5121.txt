Chapter 5121: Observing In the Dark

“Chu Feng, you… What’s your cultivation level? Have you reached Half-God level too?!”

Lord Bai’s voice was practically quivering. He was unable to gauge how powerful Chu Feng was due to his lacking cultivation, but he could sense that he was extremely powerful. That was why he mistook Chu Feng for a Half-God level cultivator.

“Lord Bai, now is not the time for questions. Hurry up and lead the way. Since you’re already calling me ‘young master’, how can I possibly turn my eyes away from the problems you’re facing?” Chu Feng asked.

“Alright, I’ll lead the way right now! I’ll accept it even if Lord Yuwei punishes me for this!”

Lord Bai gritted his teeth as he came to a decision.

Shoosh!

Everything in the surroundings suddenly changed the next moment.

By the time Lord Bai snapped out of it, he was already out of the golden river and was traveling at an incredible speed in the direction where Lord Yuwei and the others had headed to.

“My gosh! How in the world are you this powerful? So this is the grandson of the famed prodigy! Has the Chu Heavenly Clan become that powerful? I reckon that no one in the Ancestral Martial Starfield will dare to disrespect the Chu Heavenly Clan now, right?” Lord Bai asked.

Chu Feng chuckled softly. “The Chu Heavenly Clan has earned the respect of the entire galaxy.”

Lord Bai was shocked to hear that.

The respect of the entire galaxy? What glory was that?

He dared not imagine something of that scale.

However, there seemed to be some credibility behind it given Chu Feng’s confident smile and his powerful cultivation. That brought a smile to Lord Bai’s lips too.

He was still feeling nervous earlier about whether he should have pointed out the way for Chu Feng, but this show of strength affirmed his decision.

In this world, there was a silt-filled black river that roared loudly along its flow. The noise wasn’t what was terrifying about it though; it was the black aura that gushed into the sky, severing the world into two. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It was a barrier.

One side of the river was filled with lush trees and flowers. This was the place where Lord Yuwei and the others lived.

On the other side was a barren black land that looked desolate and unnerving. That was the place where the guards lived.

Lord Yuwei was standing on one end of the river with tens of millions of people standing behind her. These people were all elites from the city, but most of them had an uneasy look on their faces.

After all, what they were up against was a terrifying army that numbered tens of millions too. They were all armored, but beneath the armor were skeletons devoid of blood or flesh. They gave off a black aura that was reminiscent of an army that had walked out of hell.

They were all living cultivators, but they were reduced to this state because they offered up their souls to become guards. Of course, those who became guards received a huge benefit. Their cultivation had grown much faster ever since they entered the barren land.

The one leading the guards had already been in this barren land for 30,000 years now, and the other cultivators who entered at the same time as him had already died of old age. Yet, he was still alive and even successfully advanced his cultivation to rank two Half-God level.

He was only at Martial Exalted level when he first entered this area. Given the limitations of his talent, it shouldn’t have been possible for him to reach Half-God level, let alone rank two Half-God.

The reason he was able to live to his current age and achieve such a high level of accomplishment was due to his choice of becoming a guard.

The benefits were clear, but many people were still reluctant to become guards because they didn’t want to become monsters. The problem was that as long as they didn’t join the guards, they would have to spend their lives fearing the guards.

The river that divided the two areas would soon dry up, joining up the divided lands. This would allow the guards to freely step onto their land.

Oblivious to the crowd, Chu Feng had already silently arrived at the scene, but he chose not to reveal himself right away.

“Young master Chu Feng, are we not heading over?” Lord Bai asked.

“We’ll wait here first,” Chu Feng said.

He would be able to ensure Lord Yuwei’s safety since he was already here, but he didn’t want to show himself because he wanted to first verify some matters.

“Alright.”

Lord Bai didn’t know what Chu Feng intended to do, but he decided to listen to him.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already started inspecting the situation. Interestingly, he noticed that the guards, despite being turned into skeletons devoid of flesh and blood, weren’t completely without souls in them. Only half of their souls disappeared, while the other half remained within them to sustain their lives.

However, this half soul was in a restrained state, which meant to say that they were being controlled. As for who was controlling them… it could only be the person whom they offered their souls up to, the master of this place.

The black river was a formidable formation that could be traced back to the Ancient Era. Chu Feng could easily tell from it that the master of this land was an extremely powerful cultivator.

Chu Feng wasn’t worried about those guards since his Asura World Spirit Army would be able to easily take them down, but he was apprehensive about facing the mastermind. That was the reason he wanted to first assess the situation.

Not too long later, the black river started to dry, and the black aura dividing the two areas started to fade. Finally, the two lands had merged into one.

Shoosh!

The moment the river vanished, Lord Yuwei waved her sleeves and pushed a gigantic box toward the guards. Filled within it was the Demonsoul Grass.

“You can return now,” Lord Yuwei said.

“Return? You think that you can satisfy us with mere Demonsoul Grass? Yuwei, have you forgotten our demands?” the guard standing at the center spoke with a sinister smile.

He was the one who had reached rank two Half-God level, the leader of the guards.

“If you want to take our people, you’ll have to bring the people whom you have previously taken over and let us see how they are faring. If they are doing well, we’ll allow you to continue taking our people,” Lord Yuwei said.

“Song Yuwei, are you trying to negotiate with me? You should know your own place. You’re nothing but a servant, not just that of our lord but us too. Your life belongs to us, but you dare to talk about conditions with us?” the leader of the guards sneered.

With a wave of his sleeves, he said, “Go! Capture them!”
