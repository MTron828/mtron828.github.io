“In that case, may I know what I must do in order to find that disappeared tomb?” Chu Feng asked.

“That is a very simple question. You just need to go there to find it,” The old cat pointed to the southeastern forest.

“There?” Chu Feng was hesitant.

At that moment, the old cat began to walk in that direction. It pointed to the land below its paws and said, “The tomb is located here.”

“It’s best you don’t deceive me. There is simply nothing there,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng was not saying those words irresponsibly. Instead, he had already used his Heaven’s Eyes to inspect that area, and did not detect anything strange in that place.

“Boy, this great sir would not deceive you. Merely, your world spirit techniques are truly too weak. With your world spirit techniques, it is simply impossible for you to find the tomb,” The old cat said.

“You are the first that dared to say that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques are lacking after seeing him use his world spirit techniques. Damned cat, you are clearly pretending to understand when you don’t,” Eggy revealed a cold gaze in her eyes. She did not believe what the old cat said.

“Are you saying his world spirit techniques are not lacking? If his world spirit techniques are not lacking, there is simply no need for me to tell him where the tomb is, he would be able to find it himself. Furthermore, he would also be able to summon that tomb,” The old cat said.

“Could it be that you know how to find the tomb?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course. This great sir will teach you a spirit formation. With that, you will be able to reveal the tomb.”

“Of course, this great sir will not help you without reason. You must first agree to one thing,” The old cat said.

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“Do you have any cigarettes?” The old cat asked.

“Cigarettes?” Chu Feng was confused.

“From the way you reacted, it seems like you don’t smoke. But, you should have seen a tobacco pipe before, right? Make a pipe for this great sir.”

“Oh, that’s right. Make it according to this dimension, this composition and this appearance,” As the old cat spoke, it began to use its claw to sketch out the appearance and composition of the tobacco pipe. Soon, it finished its sketch.

“Yoh, you’re quite skillful,” In response, Her Lady Queen was unable to keep herself from voicing a bit of praise.

The reason for that was because the old cat’s sketch was not only very detailed, the old cat also finished the sketch very quickly.

Not to mention a cat, even for a martial cultivator, something like drawing a design that detailed would be very difficult to accomplish.

From merely that point, one could determine that this cat was truly extraordinary.

“Boy, what are you still standing there for? Quickly, go and make one such pipe for this great sir,” That old cat began to boss Chu Feng around.

“Hey, damned cat, you’re looking for a beating!” In response, Her Lady Queen was angered. She raised her hand with the intention of beating the old cat.

However, Chu Feng stopped her again. Then, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and a small amount of Immortal-level spirit power appeared. In the blink of an eye, that small amount of spirit power took form of a tobacco pipe.

That tobacco pipe soon condensed into an actual pipe. One simply could not tell that it was formed with spirit power. Furthermore, its measurements and appearance were exactly the same as the sketch from that old cat.

However, when that immaculate tobacco pipe reached the old cat’s grasp, “It’s decent enough” was the only evaluation Chu Feng received.

“As you’re a world spiritist, you most definitely possess Spirit Loosening Herb. Give some to this grand sir,” The old cat began to boss Chu Feng around again. It was acting as if it were truly a great sir.

As for Chu Feng, he was not angered by the old cat. He took out several bits of Spirit Loosening Herb and handed them to the old cat.

The old cat placed the Spirit Loosening Herbs onto the ground. Then, it said, “Dry them up.”

Chu Feng continued doing as the old cat ordered. After all, to Chu Feng, those things were simply extremely easy to accomplish. At the very least, they were much easier to do than setting up spirit formations.

“Give me a Cosmos Sack,” The old cat said.

Chu Feng was not stingy. He took out an empty Cosmos Sack and handed it directly to the old cat.

Then, that old cat hung the Cosmos Sack around its neck and began to remove the leaves from the Spirit Loosening Herb before stuffing them into the Cosmos Sack.

After that, the old cat took a small portion of the Spirit Loosening Herb and stuffed it into the tobacco pipe. Then, it said to Chu Feng, “Light it.”

Chu Feng pointed at the tobacco pipe with his finger, and a spark fell into the tobacco pipe. After the Spirit Loosening Herb’s leaves were ignited, a smoke began to rise.

As for that old cat, it began to suck on the tobacco pipe in a very familiar manner. Not only was the old cat sucking on the pipe, it was also blowing out smoke.

The smoke was coming out from both his mouth and his nose. In fact, that old cat was capable of even changing the shape of the smoke to all kinds of different shapes.

As the old cat continued to suck on the pipe, it closed its eyes. It was truly taking pleasure in it.

At that moment, Chu Feng felt even more that the old cat was extraordinary. It was not only because it was smoking like an experienced individual.

For one, although Chu Feng knew that the Spirit Loosening Herb was a medicinal herb, he only knew that its roots were useful and thought the leaves to not be of much use at all.

However, he truly never expected that one could smoke the leaves of the Spirit Loosening Herb like tobacco. Furthermore, the smell of the Spirit Loosening Herb was much more fragrant than tobacco.

“The Spirit Loosening Herb’s medicinal usage is not much. However, when smoking it like tobacco, it can barely pass,” The old cat said while enjoying the pleasures of his smoking.

“Are you able to tell me how to find the tomb now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course not. You still haven’t agreed to help me yet,” The old cat said.

“Are you to saying that this smoke is not enough?” Chu Feng said.

“Of course not. It is merely smoke. You wish to obtain the whereabouts of the tomb from me with merely smoke? You are truly getting carried away by your wishful thinking, no?” The old cat cast a gaze of contempt at Chu Feng.

“Very well. Go ahead and tell me what you want me to help you with,” Chu Feng said.

“Is the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple still present?” The old cat asked.

“It is,” Chu Feng said.

“Then go to Buddha’s Heavenly Temple and find their current Abbot. Tell him that their founder, Lord Tiger, is trapped in this place. Tell him to find at least ten Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists and have them come here to save me,” The old cat said.

“Hahaha, Lord Tiger? You’re clearly an old and lousy cat. There’s an enormous difference between you and a tiger, no?” At that moment, Eggy started to laugh at the old cat’s remarks.

However, Chu Feng had a very serious expression on his face. The reason for that was because he felt that the cat’s bearing, as well as the tone that it spoke with, both seemed to indicate that it was not joking around or lying.

Could it be that this cat was truly the founder of the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple? If that was real, wouldn’t it be too ridiculous?

Buddha’s Heavenly Temple was a sacred place devoted to Buddhism. How could its founder be a cat?

At that moment, Chu Feng began to size up the old cat once again. However, no matter how he looked at the cat, it only resembled an ordinary cat to him.

However, the old cat was clearly extremely extraordinary. At the very least, the fact that it could speak was already extremely extraordinary.

This made Chu Feng realize that he was simply unable to see through that cat.

“Are you truly the founder of Buddha’s Heavenly Temple?” Chu Feng asked.

“This great sir would never lie,” The old cat replied.

“Then why are you trapped here?” Chu Feng asked.

“Is there even a need to ask? It’s naturally because of the treasures here,” Eggy said.

“Humph, damned silly girl, you are truly looking down on me too excessively, no?” The old cat laughed disdainfully. Then, it turned to Chu Feng and said, “Boy, if you are to help this great sir, after I get out of here, I will definitely have the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple protect you.”

“Even if what you say is the truth, I am still unable to help you just like this. The reason for that is because I am uncertain if what you are saying is true or false. After all, the current you is without any cultivation at all,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s simple. I’ll tell you some secrets regarding Buddha’s Heavenly Temple,” The old cat said indifferently.

“First, I do not have much of an understanding toward Buddha’s Heavenly Temple. Next, I am not interested in the secrets of Buddha’s Heavenly Temple,” Chu Feng said.

“Then what do you want?” The old cat asked.

“How about this: you tell me how to find the tomb first. If what you tell me is useful, I will then go and find the people from Buddha’s Heavenly Temple to bring them here,” Chu Feng said.

“That won’t do. What if I am to tell you how to find the tomb, but then you decide to refuse to find people from Buddha’s Heavenly Temple?” The old cat had a disbelieving expression on its face. Cunning was written all over it.
