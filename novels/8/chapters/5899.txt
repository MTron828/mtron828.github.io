Chapter 5900: The Gaze in the Darkness

“Let me take another look.” Chu Feng took a closer look at the assimilation formation.

The assimilation formation was so complicated that Chu Feng could only verify that it was an assimilation formation, as that portion of it was conspicuous. However, there should be other clues regarding it.

Soon, Chu Feng discovered a new part of the formation. “It contained a teleportation formation too.”

“Teleportation formation? What does that mean?” Zi Ling was confused.

“It suggests that the situation might not have been as bad as we have envisioned. This place doesn’t just serve to assimilate all of the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen who arrive here; rather, it picks who to assimilate,” Chu Feng said.

“I see.” Zi Ling breathed a sigh of relief.

However, Sansheng Qiutian didn’t get what was going on. “Brother Chu Feng, I'm dim-witted. Can you be more direct?”

“This formation has been abandoned. If not for that, we might have been presented with the option to confront the assimilation formation. If we fail to hold on, there would be an option to surrender. That could be the reason the teleportation formation was here,” Chu Feng said.

“Enter the assimilation formation? Only someone with water in their head would enter the assimilation formation!” Sansheng Qiutian exclaimed.

“What if this assimilation formation consumes something that can be recovered over time, and this formation will be successfully breached once you meet its requirement?” Chu Feng asked.

“If that’s the case, we can still give it a try,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“I suspect that’s the case. I don’t think your ancestors would go through so much trouble to assimilate their descendants. There’s no need for them to construct such complicated formations for that,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s reassuring,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“What should we do next?” Sansheng Xingyu asked.

“I have an idea in mind, but I need to verify its feasibility first. Give me a moment.” Chu Feng continued observing the runes, and soon, he made up his mind.

His solution was simple—he merely needed to construct a formation.

He constructed a formation based on what he had discerned and activated it. There was a brilliant outburst of light, and the walls began glowing with a mysterious light. Runes reminiscent of butterflies flew out and gathered around Chu Feng and the others.

At the same time, the light converged to form a spirit formation gate.

“Chu Feng, is this... a success?” Sansheng Qiutian looked at the glowing golden runes on them, and he trembled with excitement.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

They had stumbled into obstacles along the way, but things went smoothly than he had expected. He didn’t expect that the final trial, which should have been the hardest of all, could be resolved through such a method.

All of a sudden, he raised his head and looked at the cavern’s ceiling. He sensed someone looking at them. The sensation vanished as soon as he raised his head, but that made him even more certain that they were being spied on.

“What’s wrong, big brother Chu Feng?” Zi Ling asked.

“It’s nothing.” Chu Feng shook his head. He turned to Sansheng Xingyu and asked, “Is there a teleportation formation on you?”

Zi Ling and Sansheng Qiutian were taken aback. The latter even outright asked, “Ah? What teleportation formation?”

Sansheng Xingyu, however, looked at him in shock and asked, “How did you know?”

“Earlier, I was going to venture into the desert alone, but Elder Clan Chief told you to follow me. I’m guessing it’s because you have a formidable teleportation formation with you. If we stumble into danger, you’ll be able to quickly drag me away with it,” Chu Feng said.

“How did you guess that?” Sansheng Xingyu was baffled.

“You can deduce so much from a single detail?” Sansheng Qiutian was bewildered.

In response, Chu Feng chuckled. “Actually, I sensed formidable spirit power rippling from your body. It might be because of your nervousness hindering your control of the formation, or else I shouldn’t have been able to sense a formation of that caliber.”

“Is that true?” Sansheng Qiutian asked Sansheng Xingyu.

“Yes, Elder Clan Chief feared that we would meet with danger, so he implanted one of our clan’s formation treasures inside me. I can activate it with a thought. I was worried when the dark lightning clouds suddenly gathered when we entered the desert for the first time, so I almost invoked the formation treasure,” Sansheng Xingyu replied.

“Are you in full control of the formation now?” Chu Feng asked.

“I should be.” Sansheng Xingyu nodded.

“Can you take out the formation?”

Sansheng Xingyu hesitated before replying with a nod. “All right.”

“Sansheng Xingyu, Sansheng Qiutian, do you trust me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course, we trust you. We would have never gotten here and breached this formation if not for you. We have no reason not to trust you,” Sansheng Qiutian said impassionedly, looking as if he was worried that Chu Feng wouldn’t trust him.

“What are you planning to do?” Sansheng Xingyu asked.

“I intend to modify the formation inside your body,” Chu Feng replied.

“Why?” Sansheng Xingyu asked.

“I’ll be honest since the two of you trust me. I didn’t want to miss a single detail while climbing the sacred mountain, so I didn’t spread my psyche too widely. Thanks to that, I sensed someone following us,” Chu Feng said.

“Someone followed us? Who is it?” Sansheng Qiutian anxiously asked.

“I don’t know, but that person was discreet. That person is likely to be very strong,” Chu Feng replied.

“Is it an outsider? No one in the clan should dare to follow us,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

They were powerful figures in the Three Saints Monstrous Clan, so the clansmen wouldn’t have dared to stalk them, not to mention his father was with them. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“But outsiders can’t get in here.” Sansheng Qiutian quickly sensed that something was amiss.

It was no easy feat to get in here.

“It doesn’t matter whether it’s an outsider or a clansman; now is not the time to be pondering about that. I could be thinking too much about it, but I think we should take precautions. Elder Clan Chief is powerful, so the four of us are the weak link here if anyone wants to attempt something. It’ll be safer if I alter the formation,” Chu Feng explained.

Sansheng Xingyu formed a hand seal, and a small bead floated out of her body. In this small bead was an incredibly powerful formation.

“I’ll release the barrier so that you can directly modify it.” Sansheng Xingyu changed her hand seal, and the barrier around the bead dissipated.

Chu Feng infused his spirit power into the bead.

The teleportation formation was powerful, and powerful formations tended to be complicated. Chu Feng dared not to let his guard down, as a mistake could render the teleportation formation ineffective. That would put them in a more dangerous position.

Chu Feng realized that the teleportation formation could only be used once, but it was worth a huge fortune. It would be a huge sin if he ruined it. Thus, he proceeded carefully.

Six hours later, he finally finished modifying the teleportation formation. By then, he was already drenched in sweat.

“All right, let me teach you a hand seal. If you encounter any danger, use this hand seal to activate the formation.” Chu Feng proceeded to teach Sansheng Xingyu a hand seal.

“All right.” Sansheng Xingyu memorized the hand seal before placing the bead back into her.

“Can we leave now?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“We can leave now, but the four of us should stay close together,” Chu Feng said.

“All right.” Sansheng Qiutian and the others nodded.

They stepped into the spirit formation gate together, and to their surprise, they didn’t return to the desert or the monotonous white space but back to the sacred mountain’s peak.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was standing at the entrance of their spirit formation gate with a nervous look. He only heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Chu Feng and the others returning safely.

“You’re finally out. What happened?” the clan chief asked.

He was enveloped by a surge of teleportation energy six hours ago and was forcefully evicted back to the sacred mountain’s peak. He quickly realized that he couldn’t enter the second spirit formation gate anymore, and the fact that Chu Feng and the others weren’t teleported out of the second spirit formation gate too made him panic.

He was frightened as he knew just how dangerous the last two formations of the sacred mountain were. However, he had no choice but to wait.

Fortunately, after three grueling hours, Chu Feng and the others finally returned.

“Father, did we succeed?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“We’ll have to wait and see,” the clan chief replied with a smile.

He noticed that Chu Feng and the others were imbued with glowing golden runes, and he recognized these golden runes as he had once obtained them. Thus, he rose to the air and formed a special hand seal.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

The glowing golden runes tore away from Chu Feng and the others’ bodies and flocked together like butterflies before flying toward the sacred temple’s silhouette that only Chu Feng could see.

As the butterflies fused into the silhouette, the sacred temple became tangible, and it seemed to be coming closer to them. It rose into the air and emanated a blinding light.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was stunned. “Could Chu Feng be right?”

The higher the sacred temple flew, the brighter its light became. This signified that it was going to bestow an extremely powerful energy, far surpassing that of before.

All of a sudden, an oppressive might descended from the sky.

By the time the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief realized what was going on, a person had already descended amid Chu Feng and the others. It was Elder Sheng.

The oppressive might had come from Elder Sheng too. It was narrowed down to envelope only Chu Feng and the others to hold them still as if incarcerating them.
