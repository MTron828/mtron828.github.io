Chapter 3696 - Bloodline Cultivation Formation

“Chu Feng, Lingxi, the two of you stay here for now. I will leave momentarily,” Gu Mingyuan said after exiting the interrogation hall.

“Senior, do you really know the location of the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master’s grandson?” asked Chu Feng.

“Mn. The Blood-devouring Hall is very dangerous. They could be said to be the most dangerous power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“As they can be used by the despicable people that have concealed themselves in the dark, the Blood-devouring Hall could be said to be the most terrifying weapon in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“In order to prevent the Blood-devouring Hall from attacking our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, our clan has been investigating the weakness of the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master the entire time.”

“Thus, I will definitely not return empty-handed,” Gu Mingyuan said.

“In that case, I will have to trouble senior,” Chu Feng thanked her.

“As Lingxi is someone of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the matters of the Chu Heavenly Clan could be considered to be the matters of our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.”

“Chu Feng, during this period of time when I’m gone, I’ll leave Lingxi in your care.”

As Gu Mingyuan said those words, she took a profound glance at Chu Lingxi.

“Who said I need him to take care of me? I can take care of myself,” said Chu Lingxi.

“Is that so?” Gu Mingyuan began to smile even stronger.

“Aiyah! If you want to go, then go. Otherwise, those captives from the Blood-devouring Hall might really attempt to kill themselves,” Chu Lingxi said with annoyance. However, her little face had turned somewhat red.

“Look at this, you’re trying to drive me away so soon?” Gu Mingyuan sighed dramatically. “This is truly what it means by ‘when a girl is of age, she must be married off.’”

“What girl is of age and must be married off? You’re simply uttering nonsense,” Chu Lingxi’s face turned even redder.

“Enough, enough. I’ll leave, I’ll leave,” Gu Mingyuan laughed. Whilst her laughter could still be heard, she had already disappeared.

After Gu Mingyuan left, Chu Feng looked to Chu Lingxi. He said, “The weather is not hot, why is your face so red?”

“Shut up!” Chu Lingxi fiercely glared at Chu Feng.

“It’s a pity.” Chu Feng suddenly sighed in a very regretful manner.

“What’s a pity?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“You have such beautiful eyes, yet you insist on glaring angrily at others. It is truly a pity,” said Chu Feng.

“If you still don’t shut up, I will beat you to death,” As Chu Lingxi spoke, she raised her fist.

“Lingxi, where’s your mother?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Right at that moment, a figure appeared. It was Chu Xuanzhengfa.

Seeing Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Feng immediately told him where Gu Mingyuan had gone.

After learning about this matter, Chu Xuanzhengfa was overjoyed. Originally, he had felt helpless about the situation. Never did he expect Gu Mingyuan to actually know such a secret.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was very confident in her ability. Thus, he felt that once she returned, they would be able to force the Blood-devouring Hall’s Hall Master to reveal the truth.

“Chu Feng, Lingxi, the two of you are both Exalted realm experts now.”

“Our Chu Heavenly Clan’s Bloodline Cultivation Formation should be effective for the two of you now.”

“As you two will not be able to help with Lord Clan Chief, rather than waiting here like this, it’s better that you enter the Bloodline Cultivation Formation to experience it.”

“If the Bloodline Cultivation Formation ends up being helpful to you two, you should stay in there and train for some time,” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Senior, please wait. I am still worried about Lord Clan Chief,” said Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, I think it’s better that we go and check out the Bloodline Cultivation Formation. I wanted to check it out anyways. I think it’s better if you accompany me,” Chu Lingxi said suddenly.

After hearing Chu Lingxi’s words, Chu Feng found it difficult to refuse her.

In fact, he had wanted to check out the Bloodline Cultivation Formation himself. Merely, when he’d returned the last time, he had encountered the opening of the Void Sacred Tree and didn’t have time to check it out before he had to leave again.

As for this time, he encountered the Blood-devouring Hall right after returning. As such, he was in no mood to check out the Bloodline Cultivation Formation.

However, since Chu Lingxi wanted him to accompany her, he would naturally not refuse.

Thus, Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi entered the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Bloodline Cultivation Formation.

Of course, Chu Xuanzhengfa was accompanying them.

“Hey, Chu Feng, did you really open this Bloodline Cultivation Formation?”

As a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Lingxi had naturally already heard about the Bloodline Altar.

That said, she had also only just learned from her father of the Bloodline Altar’s eight cultivation formations being forever open.

As for that, it was all due to Chu Feng.

One should know that not even Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan had managed to accomplish such a feat.

Yet, Chu Feng had accomplished it. That was the reason why she was so surprised.

“It was indeed Chu Feng.”

“At that time, I was also present.” said Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“You’re truly quite something. Speaking of it, if it wasn’t for my mother’s help, I would really not be able to catch up to you.”

She sighed. “Your talent is simply too terrifying. Likely, I will be overtaken by you sooner or later. I truly cannot afford to slack off in the slightest.”

“Girl, stop making such modest remarks,” Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.

“I am not being modest here. I merely know my capabilities,” said Chu Lingxi.

As they laughed and chatted, the three of them entered the Bloodline Cultivation Formation.

“Wow! This place is so rich with natural energies.”

Chu Lingxi immediately became excited the moment she entered.

She was not the only one. Chu Feng was also able to sense how overwhelmingly powerful that place was.

Chu Feng had actually already entered the Bloodline Cultivation Formation when it had first opened.

Unfortunately, the natural energies of there were practically all Exalted-level, and of no help to him.

As he could not gain any comprehension, he did not stay for long.

But now, Chu Feng’s cultivation had reached rank three Exalted. Entering again as an Exalted was a completely different experience.

That place not only contained martial comprehension and boundless martial power, it even enlivened one’s Bloodline Power.

This was truly a sacred cultivation ground for those that possessed Heavenly Bloodlines.

To enter that place again, it would not be excessive to describe Chu Feng’s experience as that of a fish back in water.

Chu Feng felt that if he were to enter closed-door training for about a year there, his cultivation would definitely increase.

Even by conservative measures, he felt that his cultivation would increase by two levels. Even increasing his cultivation by three levels was not impossible.
