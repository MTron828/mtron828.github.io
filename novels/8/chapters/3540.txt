Chapter 3540 - The Revival Of The Demon Clan

After that mysterious individual removed his black cloak and revealed his true appearance, the crowd were all somewhat frightened by the way he looked.

His skin was completely dark blue. However, there were crimson blood-like wrinkles throughout his dark blue skin.

Upon closer inspection, those were not wrinkles. Instead, they were wounds. Bloody wounds covered his body with regularity. It was both strange and terrifying to look at.

Strangest of all, even though those wounds seemed to be new, they were not dripping blood. Instead, the blood seemed to be sealed away, making it so that one could only see the blood flowing through the wounds. It was truly disgusting to look at.

As for his eyes, they were white. Furthermore, his gaze was very strange.

From a glance, one could tell that he was simply not a human. Rather, he resembled a monster.

“Blood-devouring Demon Clan.”

“You’re from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan?!”

Many panic-filled voices sounded from the crowd.

At the same time, the crowd burst into complete chaos and fear enveloped the vast sea of people. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The crowd was both surprised and frightened. This was especially true for the experts from the older generation. The fear on their faces was even more intense.

The Blood-devouring Demon Clan was famous throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

The Blood-devouring Demon Clan did not occupy an Upper Realm. In fact, they did not even occupy any Ordinary Realm or Lower Realm.

However, during their golden age, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan were found throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. They were practically everywhere, and could even be said to be the power that possessed the greatest number of clansmen in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Furthermore, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan were extremely united. There had practically never been an incident where they fought amongst themselves.

Most importantly, there were a lot of experts in the Blood-devouring Demon Clan. They could be said to be an extremely strong power.

It was precisely because they were so strong that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan was seen as a thorn by the Starfield Master Realm.

As the saying went, a mountain cannot contain two tigers. This was even more so for an overlord like the Starfield Master Realm that refused to allow their status to be threatened by others.

In the end, a war was waged over nine thousand years ago.

Originally, the war was only between the Starfield Master Realm and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan.

However, after the war began, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan decided, for the sake of increasing their battle power, to start assassinating experts from various Territories.

Later on, their actions were exposed.

Because of this, they incurred the wrath of powers all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield. With that, those powers also joined the war against the Blood-devouring Demon Clan.

That war brought disaster upon the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. In the end, the war concluded with a crushing defeat for the Blood-devouring Demon Clan.

When that battle was happening, the current peak experts of the Ancestral Martial Starfield were all still very young, still only children, or still not born yet.

However, they all knew how bitter that war was, as well as how powerful the Blood-devouring Demon Clan was.

After over nine thousand years had passed, no traces of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan were ever seen again. Because of that, matters regarding that clan became a story to the people of future generations.

Thus, everyone felt that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan had been completely annihilated. They felt that the powerful Blood-devouring Demon Clan had become nothing more than a story of the past.

Yet, the appearance of the man before them was precisely the specific, unique look of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.

The wrinkle-like wounds on his body was none other than the Blood-devouring Technique.

Only by training in the Blood-devouring Technique would one’s body appear like that.

But, why would the Blood-devouring Demon Clan that had disappeared for over nine thousand years suddenly reappear at that moment?

Could it be that the terrifying Blood-devouring Demon Clan had been revived?

Thinking back to how the Blood-devouring Demon Clan captured people from various powers and refined them to increase their cultivation in the battle against the Starfield Master Realm, the people of the older generation immediately started to tremble with fear.

“Hahahaha. Never would I have imagined that, even after all these years, the might of our Blood-devouring Demon Clan is still so resounding.”

“Truth be told, this old man is indeed a member of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan. My name is Mo Song,” that man said.

“Mo Song?” I’ve never heard of that name before,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“During the war, I was still only a child too. It is normal for you to have never heard of my name,” said Mo Song.

“In that case, it would mean that the mysterious group of people that entered the Void Sacred Tree before us would be you all, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan?” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“That’s correct,” Mo Song nodded.

“The remnants of your Blood-devouring Demon Clan have hidden yourselves for so many years. Why did you decide to suddenly reappear now?” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Who told you that we only decided to reappear now? Our Blood-devouring Demon Clan has always existed throughout all these years. Merely...”

As Mo Song reached this point, he turned his gaze to the crowd. Coldness flashed through his eyes, “Those who saw us all ended up dying.”

“This...” Hearing those words, the crowd that were already afraid became extremely terrified. After all, they were not only against a peak Exalted-level Blood-devouring Demon Clansman, but they were also facing the crisis of death.

“You still didn’t mention what your purpose in coming to this place was,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“You seem to have a lot of rubbish that you wish to ask. Even though you all will die here, you are not qualified to learn about those things,” Mo Song looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief mockingly.

“So that’s the case. In that case, I can only force a confession from you,” said the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“What did you say?” Mo Song revealed a surprised look. He didn’t dare to believe what he had just heard.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s body shifted, and he disappeared.

In the next moment, he appeared before Mo Song.

When he appeared again, there was not only a ‘Heaven’ character Lightning Mark on his forehead, but his aura had also increased to that of a rank nine Exalted. Furthermore, his right hand was thrust toward Mo Song’s body like a sharp blade.

“Puchi~~~”

Everything happened too quickly. By the time the crowd managed to react to what had happened, blood had splattered everywhere. The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had pierced through Mo Song’s body with his arm and destroyed his dantian.

“I said that I can only force a confession from you,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief pulled his arm from Mo Song’s body and revealed a faint smile.

Mo Song was seriously injured. He took several steps back, and then fell on his butt.

At that moment, Mo Song had an extremely ugly expression on his face. Even though he had a very terrifying appearance, one could tell that he was in enormous pain.

Furthermore, he was looking at the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with a gaze filled with shock and unease.

“This aura... you... you’re also a rank nine Exalted?” Mo Song asked with a weak voice.
