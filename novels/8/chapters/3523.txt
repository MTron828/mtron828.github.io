Chapter 3523 - Gong Strikes

Finally, the majestic armies of the Hong Beast Clan and the Goldenstone Royal Clan arrived before the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.

“Old Thief Chu, scram out here!!!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. Heaven and earth shook violently from that shout.

In fact, it was not only heaven and earth that shook when the furious shout was heard. The hearts of all the people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm also trembled with fear.

Rank six Exalted. An existence of that caliber was someone that no one in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm could contend with. Not even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would be a match.

The shout from the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief had verified that he had come to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm with ill intentions.

At that moment, everyone in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was deeply afraid. They felt that the Chu Heavenly Clan was facing an imminent catastrophe.

As for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they immediately rushed inside the clan to inform their Lord Clan Chief.

All of a sudden, panic filled the surroundings.

“Exactly how did he manage to accomplish that? To be able to reach rank six Exalted, that sort of progress is simply too fast, no?”

“What are we to do now? Are we really going to fight them?”

“If the Chu Heavenly Clan ends up being defeated, we will not have an easy time either.”

At that moment, the powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were all frightened. They were all hiding as they investigated the situation.

Although they had tagged along to check things out, the result of their investigation was not something they wished to see.

“Everyone, rest assured. We have only come here today to seek out justice from the Chu Heavenly Clan. We are only targeting the Chu Heavenly Clan. It is unrelated to you all.”

Suddenly, a figure appeared before the crowd’s line of sight. It was the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief.

Hearing his words, the crowd that were originally worried felt a lot more at ease.

However, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen became even more worried. The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief had stated that they had come precisely for their Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, it was practically certain that they were here looking for trouble.

“Sure enough, they’ve come to seek out revenge from the Chu Heavenly Clan. It would appear that the Chu Heavenly Clan is facing an imminent catastrophe.”

“There’s nothing that can be done about this. After all, the world of martial cultivators is as such. If one is inferior to others, one can only allow oneself to be bullied and humiliated. If one must blame someone, then one can only blame the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief for not making progress in his cultivation as fast as the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief.”

The people from the various powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm did not leave. They continued to secretly whisper to one another.

No matter what, they were people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Even if the matter wasn’t of any concern to them, they still felt a lot of sympathy for what the Chu Heavenly Clan was faced with.

Merely, they knew that the world of martial cultivators was one where might was right.

There were countless powerful clans of hundreds of millions that ended up being completely wiped out overnight because they fought the wrong people.

Tragedies of clans being extinguished were simply too many to count...

Thus, there was nothing they could do. They could only watch as everything unfolded before them.

“Lord Father, have a look. It’s not only the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that are afraid; even their henchmen in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm are deeply afraid.”

“Truly never would I have ever imagined that they would have a day like this too.”

A young man walked out from behind the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief. That young man was named Jinshi Bo. Not only was Jinshi Bo the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief’s son, but he had also previously accompanied his father to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and ended up having conflicts with Chu Feng. Unfortunately, he ended up suffering greatly by Chu Feng’s hands.

Because of that, he felt endless hatred for Chu Feng. This was especially true after he saw how his father, the chief of a clan and the overlord of an Upper Realm, was humiliated by Chu Xuanzhengfa, and he started feeling a bone-deep hatred for the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.

He had long hoped for the day when the Chu Heavenly Clan would suffer. Finally... he was able to obtain his revenge.

“This is what a world where the strong rules is like. Today... I will have that Chu Xuanzhengfa kneel before me while making an apology to me,” a ruthless expression was present on his face as the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief said those words. It would appear that the humiliation he had suffered that day had been deeply engraved in his heart. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Merely kneel and apologize? Clan Chief Jinshi, aren’t you being too benevolent?” Another voice was suddenly heard. It was actually the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Lord Hong, how do you plan to take care of the Chu Heavenly Clan?” The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief asked with a beaming smile on his face. Even though he appeared very impressive earlier, he immediately became extremely humble as he faced the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief. He was acting like a henchman.

“You will soon know what I plan to do,” the corners of the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief’s lips rose into a cold smile. Coldness flashed through his eyes.

Seeing that, the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief asked no more. He knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan would likely really end up suffering a major calamity.

“Clank~~~”

“Clank~~~”

“Clank~~~”

Suddenly, a series of rumbles sounded from behind them. Those were the sounds of gongs being struck.

“Who dares to beat the gong?! Do you not see that we are...”

Hearing those sounds, the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief and the Hong Beast Clan’s Clan Chief were both furious. They immediately turned around with the intention to curse loudly.

However, when they saw who it was that came, they stood there stunned.

A group of people were flying over from the direction where the gong could be heard.

Their numbers were much less imposing than the armies of the Goldenstone Royal Clansmen and Hong Beast Clansmen.

However, the banner drifting in the wind tensed up the nerves of the crowd.

That was... the Tang Heavenly Clan!!!
