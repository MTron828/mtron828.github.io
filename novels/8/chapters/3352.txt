Chapter 3352 -The True Match

Apart from Wuming Fenghuo, everyone else was surprised by Chu Feng’s current cultivation.

This included the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and everyone else.

Even if the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was present, he would definitely be surprised by Chu Feng’s cultivation too.

After all, Chu Feng was only a rank five Martial Immortal before.

In merely a short few days, he actually managed to make two successive breakthroughs to become a rank seven Martial Immortal. Furthermore, he had done so while enduring the torture of the Heavenly Lightning. With this, how could they not be astonished?

Actually, it was inevitable that Chu Feng would make a breakthrough to rank six Martial Immortal. He had managed to gain a lot of comprehension from the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Ancient Era’s remnant, and was certain that he would be able to make a breakthrough soon.

As for the reason why Chu Feng was able to make two successive breakthroughs to rank seven Martial Immortal, it was actually because of the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform’s Heavenly Lightning that had struck him repeatedly.

Whilst it was true that the Heavenly Lightning was extremely destructive, they also brought an enormous benefit to Chu Feng.

By relying on his outstanding willpower and extraordinary comprehension, Chu Feng managed to gain a deeper understanding of controlling his bloodline’s power while being struck by the Heavenly Lightning. Over time, this led to an increase in his cultivation, and allowed him to make two successive breakthroughs.

Thus, the torture Chu Feng had gone through on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform was actually much inferior to the benefit he had gained from it.

Suddenly, someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan cried out in alarm. “I get it now! The two astonishing strikes of nine-colored lightning from earlier were not caused by the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform. Instead, they were the Divine Tribulation Lightning from Chu Feng’s breakthroughs.”

“He gained the enlightenment needed to reach a breakthrough on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, and even made successive breakthroughs on it. That’s how he gained his current level of cultivation.”

“What? On the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform? How is that possible?”

Upon hearing the words of that Chu Heavenly Clansman, the people from the Fang Heavenly Clan, the Zhao Heavenly Clan and the Song Heavenly Clan all revealed expressions of disbelief.

They were also Heavenly Clans, and also possessed Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platforms within their respective clans. They knew full well the dangers of the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform.

To be able to withstand the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform for a single day was already an extraordinary feat.

To be able to make successive breakthroughs on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform?

That was simply a delusional dream, something that was impossible to accomplish.

At the very least, that was something no human could accomplish.

“I was wondering why those two bolts of Heavenly Lightning were so astonishingly powerful. Judging from it now, Chu Feng should’ve trained in the same Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique as his father and grandfather, no?” Wuming Fenghuo asked.

“The same Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique? Wouldn’t that be...?”

Once Wuming Fenghuo said those words, the hearts of the Fang Heavenly Clansmen and the people that they had brought with them all started to tremble with fear.

The same Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique as Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan, wouldn’t that be the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?

‘Wasn’t that Chu Feng deemed to be trash incapable of cultivation?’

‘Even if he were able to cultivate, with his talent, he shouldn’t be able to train in a Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique of such a caliber, no?’

‘Else, wouldn’t that mean that Chu Feng is the same as his father and grandfather, a demon-level genius?’

“Milord, that is indeed the case,” Chu Feng answered.

“He... has actually really trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?!”

The Fang Heavenly Clansmen reacted as if they were struck by lightning upon hearing Chu Feng’s answer. They were at a complete loss as to what to do.

‘That Chu Feng was actually really so talented that he trained in even the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?’

‘How could he be trash unable to cultivate? He is simply a heaven-defying monster!’

Earlier, the Fang Heavenly Clansmen were looking at Chu Feng with ridiculing gazes. However, they were now not only looking at Chu Feng with seriousness in their eyes, but there was even a trace of fear present.

After all, the match was a match that concerned their authority over the Purpletree Ordinary Realm. Their Fang Heavenly Clan could not afford to lose.

However, both their Fang Hualong and Chu Feng were rank seven Martial Immortals. Furthermore, Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan’s son, and had trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

Whilst it was true that their Fang Hualong was very powerful, they still did not have absolute confidence that he would obtain certain victory against Chu Feng.

Feeling helpless, the Fang Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to a person, Wuming Gangxiong.

Wuming Gangxiong was their Fang Heavenly Clan’s backer. It was all thanks to Wuming Gangxiong that they were able to hold this unfair match.

Thus, if there was anyone that could possibly help them, it would be him.

However, Wuming Gangxiong acted as if he did not notice the Fang Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s pleading gaze.

If Wuming Fenghuo were not present, Wuming Gangxiong would be able to dictate everything.

However, Wuming Fenghuo was there. With that, Wuming Gangxiong did not dare to say anything.

Besides, even a fool could tell that Wuming Fenghuo had great expectations for Chu Feng’s later performance. Who would dare to disturb his interest?

That was Wuming Fenghuo of the Starfield Master Realm’s Ten Great Experts, a person with true strength and status in the Starfield Master Realm!

“It would appear that we can only rely on Hualong now.”

After finding out that his plea for help was useless, the Fang Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had no choice but to turn his gaze to Fang Hualong, their only hope.

Upon doing so, he was comforted to discover that, even after finding out how powerful of a foe Chu Feng was, Fang Hualong still had a calm and composed look. His proud appearance that seemed to show disdain for the entire world was not at all weakened by Chu Feng’s performance.

At that moment, he was still emitting an air of confidence.

Indeed, Fang Hualong was the strongest genius to have ever appeared in the Fang Heavenly Clan in the last ten thousand, or even several tens of thousands of years.

He really did possess the qualifications to have that sort of confidence. His confidence was not blind. Instead, it was confidence gained through experience and ability.

Seeing such a Fang Hualong, not only did the Fang Heavenly Clansmen sigh in relief, but even Wuming Gangxiong quietly heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Wuming Gangxiong had received considerable benefits from the Fang Heavenly Clan to help them fix the match so that they could win. If the Fang Heavenly Clan were to lose, he would also feel humiliated.

......

Suddenly, the crowd’s expressions turned serious. Everyone fixed their eyes onto the grand formation.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had set off. After defeating the Fang Heavenly Clan’s offense, Chu Feng, with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s banner in hand, soared into the sky and crossed the border river.

Chu Feng was the first and only member of the Chu Heavenly Clan to have stepped over that river.

With this, everyone knew that...

...the true match could happen at any moment!!!
