Chapter 4227 - Ruthless Master

It took a long while for the All-seeing Heavenly Master to calm down and gather enough strength to stand again.

She had been truly terrified by what had happened.

Once she got up, she immediately went over to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, took out a lot of precious treasures and set up a healing formation to treat her master’s injuries.

She knew very well that her master’s condition was very bad. If she didn’t promptly treat his injuries, her master could very possibly end up dying.

After being treated for a long time, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted finally regained consciousness.

“Master, how are you feeling?” The All-seeing Heavenly Master was overjoyed to see her master awaken.

Although his condition was still very bad, just being able to regain his consciousness meant that he would not immediately die. At least, he could still be saved.

“This Exalted’s soul has been seriously injured. I will need to slowly recuperate.”

“As such, it’ll be impossible for me to proceed for the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.”

The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted was filled with regret as he said those words.

“But master, if you don’t go, then wouldn’t you be giving everything in the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain to others for free?”

The All-seeing Heavenly Master was very sad.

She knew very well how long her master had prepared for the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

He had even entered closed-door training all so that he could make a breakthrough, all so that he could smoothly obtain the inheritance in the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

Her master had also succeeded in making a breakthrough to rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation.

Such strength was more than sufficient to show disdain for the entire Holy Light Galaxy. Simply no one would be able to contend against her master.

However, simply no one would’ve expected that they would’ve encountered a malignant star at such a crucial moment. Because of that, her master had been seriously injured.

“Master, it’s all this disciple’s fault. I was the one that implicated master,” the All-seeing Heavenly Master said with guilt.

After all, the three mysterious people had come for her. Her master had only been so seriously injured because he had stood up for her.

Even though this wasn’t what she had wanted, it remained that if it hadn’t been for her, her master the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted wouldn’t have ended up suffering such serious injuries.

“What has happened has already happened. Don’t overthink things. It is already a massive blessing within a misfortune that this old man was able to survive.”

“But, my good disciple, master’s injuries are too serious. Not only do I need to recuperate for a long period of time, my injuries also need to be treated promptly.”

“Right now, the only person capable of treating master’s illness is you.”

The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s voice was extremely weak. But, he showed no intention of blaming the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

“Master, this disciple will give her all to treat master’s injuries,” guaranteed the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

After saying those words, she began putting forth all her effort to set up a spirit formation to treat her master’s injuries.

However, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted shook his head. “Disciple, you won’t be able to help me with only that.”

“Master, what should this disciple do then?”

“Master, please instruct me,” said the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

Hearing those words, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted gathered all his strength and raised both hands to open up his clothes and reveal his chest.

There was a spirit formation on his chest.

“That is?!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The All-seeing Heavenly Master’s pupils shrank instantly upon seeing the spirit formation. She was actually scared.

Although she was unable to tell what sort of spirit formation it was, she could sense that it was strange just by seeing it.

“Disciple, put your hand on it.”

“My spirit formation will instruct you on what you must do to help me,” said the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“Master...”

The All-seeing Heavenly Master was hesitant.

It wasn’t that she didn’t want to help her master. It was simply that the spirit formation was too strange.

The spirit formation caused her to feel great unease.

“Disciple, master was injured because of you.”

“Are you planning to refuse to help your master treat his injuries?” asked the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

“Master, it is all thanks to your nurturing that this disciple was able to gain her current standing.”

“This disciple would not go against master’s desire.”

After saying that, All-seeing Heavenly Master extended her arm and placed her hand on the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s chest.

“Buzz---”

Once her palm landed on the spirit formation, the spirit formation emitted dark-red light.

At the same time, terrifying screams that sounded like evil spirits seeking lives resonated through the surrounding region.

The All-seeing Heavenly Master’s complexion changed enormously. She began screaming in miserable pain.

“Master, please spare this disciple.”

The All-seeing Heavenly Master was struggling violently. She wanted to remove her hand.

But, her struggling was completely futile.

The benevolent expression had disappeared from the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s eyes. Instead, an intense look of ruthlessness had taken its place.

“You useless trash. Apart from stirring up trouble, all you’re capable of is inviting disasters.”

“This old man has prepared for that Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain for many years. Yet, because of the trouble you’ve caused, I am unable to go there. Today, I shall use your life to heal my injuries.”

After the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted said those words, the strange screaming voices grew even louder, and the dark-red light became even more intense.

In contrast, the All-seeing Heavenly Master’s screams started to gradually weaken.

Finally, the red light dissipated, and the voices were no longer present. With a ‘putt,’ the All-seeing Heavenly Master fell onto the ground.

The All-seeing Heavenly Master had been reduced to a dried-up corpse. Not only had she been mutilated beyond recognition, she was also devoid of any signs of life.

As for the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, his complexion had grown much better.

However, even though he was no longer as weak as before, one could still tell that he was seriously injured.

Nevertheless, he stood up and soared into the sky.

However, right after flying into the air, he crashed to the ground again.

“Damn it! Must this old man really miss out on this opportunity?!”

Unreconciliation filled the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s face.

......

The Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain was actually located in a relatively desolate place.

It was in a certain Starfield’s Lower Realm.

No one knew why such a powerful remnant would be hidden in such a place.

However, because of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain, that Lower Realm had undergone a complete upheaval.

Powerful world spiritists from throughout the Holy Light Galaxy would frequently visit that Lower Realm. Some even had even begun staying there long-term.

At that moment, that Lower Realm was particularly lively.

Even the legendary powerful world spiritists that had been in closed-door training had appeared.

The reason for that was because the day of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain’s opening, was quickly approaching.
