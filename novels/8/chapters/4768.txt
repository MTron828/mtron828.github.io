Chapter 4768: I Call the Shots

The Blackwater Sixfinger Lake only opened once every five years. Outside of that, it was usually sealed off by a barrier, disallowing anyone from coming close. Fortunately, the barrier was transparent, allowing on to view its true form even when the location wasn’t open.

The calamity looming over the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect veiled the sky above with dark clouds, making it absolutely dark whenever night descended. The lack of light source in the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake meant that other than the vague outlines of its six towering peaks, there was hardly anything that could be seen at all.

However, at this very moment, the six peaks of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake were currently glowing as brightly as the sun, radiating light into the surroundings. The night sky became so bright that it looked as if a new day was already before them. Even the dark clouds above were enveloped by the white light.

This was almost at the level of a phenomenon.

The crowd was astonished. Even those far in the distance who had no idea what was going on quickly rushed over to take a look. They thought that a mishap had occurred.

No one understood why such a phenomenon was occurring in the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake.

However, there were also some who turned their eyes to Chu Feng. As unbelievable as it was, this phenomenon had occurred after Chu Feng formed a series of hand seals and made his speech.

Was it possible that this phenomenon was caused by Chu Feng?

“Chu Feng, a-are you the one who did this?” an elder of the North Tortoise Hall asked incredulously.

Too overwhelmed with shock, he even stuttered a little.

It wasn’t just him. The others couldn’t believe that this was happening due to Chu Feng too. It was not that they were looking down on him, but this matter was of grave importance here.

While the crowd was just bewildered by the turn of events, Nangong Yuliu’s face had turned completely pale. He was so nervous that cold sweat was dripping down his face.

He had come here with the intent to deal with Chu Feng and embarrass him. He had even prepared the humiliating token which Chu Feng would be wearing around his neck from now onward.

However, if Chu Feng was really the one who triggered this phenomenon, even if he didn’t break Dugu Lingtian’s record, he would surely be highly regarded by the sect.

The tables might really turn on him at this rate!

“I never thought that it would be happening in advance.”

While the crowd was speculating about the truth, a silhouette suddenly descended from the sky. The crowd was visibly relieved by the presence of this silhouette, for he was no other than Protector Qi of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake.

“Lord Protector, what’s this phenomenon? Why would the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake suddenly look like that?”

The crowd asked.

“The Blackwater Sixfinger Lake is a formation created by the sect founder. No one is able to control it, and the only reason why it’s able to continue functioning to this day is due to his ingenuity. Every thousand years, the formation would replenish its own energy, and the phenomenon you are witnessing at the moment is a byproduct of that,” Protector Qi said.

“Lord Protector, does this mean that the phenomenon has nothing to do with Chu Feng?” Nangong Yuliu asked anxiously.

“Heh...” Protector Qi sneered coldly. “It is a means left behind by the sect founder. How could a disciple like Chu Feng possibly hope to faze the formation?”

“I knew it! Chu Feng, you sure know how to put on an act!”

Upon receiving his answer, Nangong Yuliu smirked in satisfaction before turning to look at Chu Feng with a snark look.

“Chu Feng, do you have any pride at all?”

“He sure is lucky to stumble upon this phenomenon while he’s putting on an act. You might be able to deceive us once, but not anymore!”

“I reckon that his record at the Snowy Heavenly Peak is mere luck too. How could someone like him possibly break Lord Dugu Lingtian’s record normally?”

Nangong Yuliu’s lackeys quickly hopped onto the bandwagon to insult Chu Feng. Even Protector Qi couldn’t resist bursting into laughter.

With the protector not displaying a sliver of respect for Chu Feng, the strangers also began criticizing Chu Feng as well, thinking that he was a scum with reprehensible morals.

From an outsider’s point of view, Chu Feng’s act of deception was indeed abominable.

However, Chu Feng was unfazed by everyone’s insults. Instead, he shook his robe slightly and examined his own body. He could see that the black marks were glowing on his body, and they moved slowly as if they were some sort of lifeforms residing in Chu Feng’s skin.

The chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall couldn’t take it anymore and started questioning, “Protector Qi, I’m aware of the situation you speak of, but it has never stirred this kind of commotion before. I believe that there’s a clear distinction between the two.”

“Are you claiming to be more knowledgeable than me? If that’s the case, you should be the protector of this place instead of me,” Protector Qi sneered.

Logically speaking, the chief elders were of equal standing with the Hidden Dragon Elders, which meant that they were superior to the protectors. It was just that the North Tortoise Hall was too weak, and its chief elder was lacking in cultivation too. That allowed Protector Qi to scorn him.

At the same time, the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall also feared Protector Qi too. If not for his desire to protect Chu Feng, he wouldn’t dare to question Protector Qi’s judgment.

Nevertheless, when he noticed Protector Qi’s displeasure, he immediately backed down.

“Protector Qi, it’s not my intention to cast doubt on your judgment,” the chief elder replied.

“Chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall, you shouldn’t misunderstand my intention either. I’m not trying to undermine you here either; I’m just speaking out the truth as I know it,” Protector Qi said.

He turned to Chu Feng and continued on, “Chu Feng, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is a place governed by rules. We value the development of our disciples’ character too. If you’ve lost, just admit it. Stop looking for excuses here.”

It was clear to the crowd that Protector Qi was telling Chu Feng to admit his loss and fulfill the end of his bet.

“Lord Protector, who told you that I’ve lost?” Chu Feng asked.

“Hahaha! Do you think that I, as the protector of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake, wouldn’t know whose name is inscribed on the mountain peaks?” Protector Qi scoffed.

“Then, whose name is there?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, suffering a loss is not shameful. Knowing when to back down and admit one’s loss is a kind of bravery too. Take this as a lesson and live your life humbly in the future. Stop indulging in your own delusions. Luck won’t forever be on your side,” Protector Qi said.

However, Chu Feng insisted on his point, saying, “Lord Protector, you aren’t answering my question. I’m asking you whose name is on the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake right now.”

Protector Qi was starting to get displeased by how persistent Chu Feng was.

“Why are you asking the obvious? It’s clearly Lord Dugu Lingtian’s name. It has been this way since a long time ago, and it’ll continue being the case in the future. Don’t bother hoping for the impossible. You can’t possibly break Lord Dugu Lingtian’s record!” Protector Qi said.

“If that’s the case, you ought to take a close look then!”

With a smirk, Chu Feng quickly formed a series of hand seals.

Weng!

The blinding light began to dim, allowing the crowd to see the top of the mountain peaks. What was there shocked everyone, be it disciples or elders.

The name above the peaks was no longer ‘Dugu Lingtian’ but ‘Chu Feng’!

“W-what? This shouldn’t be... This can’t possibly be... It was still Lord Dugu Lingtian’s name a moment ago! How could it possibly have changed?” Protector Qi uttered in disbelief, unable to accept the reality of things.

“Lord Protector, you mentioned that the earlier phenomenon was a natural occurrence of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. Well, do you think that it’ll continue to stay lit up then?” Chu Feng asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“What do you mean?”

Protector Qi saw a cold smile seated upon Chu Feng’s lips, and it left him with a bad premonition.

Chu Feng pointed to his lips and said, “Look at my mouth. Light up.”

Weng!

The Blackwater Sixfinger Lake began glowing brightly.

“Extinguish.”

The light dissipated, plunging the surroundings into darkness.

“Light up.”

Once again, the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake was irradiated with blinding light.

“Extinguish.”

Darkness.

This series of actions made it clear to the crowd that the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake was heeding Chu Feng’s orders. The evidence was clear as day now.

The crowd was dumbfounded. All of the disciples looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with reverence, for the formation Chu Feng was controlling was one that was constructed by their great sect founder.

Putting aside mere disciples, even Protector Qi didn’t have the ability to control the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake!

“Lord Protector, do you understand what’s going on now?” Chu Feng asked Protector Qi disdainfully.

“Chu Feng, what did you do?” Protector Qi questioned.

His tone was filled with disbelief, rage, nervousness, and panic.

“You might be unhappy to hear me say this, but the truth is that I’m the one who calls the shot over here at the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake now!”

Weng!

An even shocking sight occurred. Multiple spirit formation gates began appearing on the barrier of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. It was supposed to be in a closed state at the moment, but the crowd was now able to enter it!
