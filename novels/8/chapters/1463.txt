MGA: Chapter 1464 - The Strongest Beautiful Sisters

“Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest? Are you certain it’s the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest?” Lin Yezhou asked.

“It should be the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest,” Being questioned in such a manner by Lin Yezhou, Fang Tuohai did not dare to be certain. However, he clearly remembered that person’s power was called the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest.

“What nonsense you’re blabbing. The Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest’s headmaster definitely could not defeat Daoist Silver Snake. Thus, how could he scare away the Jadewater Temple’s headmaster?”

Lin Yezhou snorted coldly. He was somewhat angry, because he felt that he had been deceived. After all, he had heard about the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest before.

In fact, not only had he heard about the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, he had also met their headmaster before.

He knew what level the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest’s headmaster was. Although he was also a Half Martial Emperor, he could not be considered to be a true expert. At the very least, even Lin Yezhou did not place him in his eyes.

Thus, how could someone like that be able to defeat Daoist Silver Snake? How could he be able to make the Jadewater Temple’s headmaster retreat without doing anything? This was practically nonsense.

“If it was the past, then perhaps that would not be the case. However, now, it is definitely true.”

Right at this moment, Chu Feng spoke. Only he knew that the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest’s headmaster had changed. Furthermore, the current headmaster of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest really did possess the strength described by Fang Tuohai.

Hong Qiang was a peak Half Martial Emperor capable of fighting against the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower. His strength was something that Chu Feng had seen with his own eyes. He was indeed extremely powerful, and furthermore, he was a person who was only a step away from becoming a Martial Emperor.

“Junior brother Chu Feng, how are you so certain? Could it be that you know the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest’s headmaster?” Fu Feiteng asked.

“I do. However, the person that I know is not the same one that you all know. Thus, you all shouldn’t doubt his strength. Although nothing else has changed in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, the strength of its headmaster is completely different from before,” Chu Feng said.

“Junior brother Chu Feng, I’ll only ask you this. Compared to our World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master, how is that Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest’s headmaster?” Lin Yezhou asked.

“I’m afraid that they would be equally matched,” Chu Feng answered.

“This...” Hearing those words, Lin Yezhou, Fu Feiteng, Sima Ying and the other disciples all sucked in a mouthful of cold air. To a greater or lesser degree, a change in expression was shown on all their faces.

The Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest was a power in the Alliance Domain. If there really was a peak Half Martial Emperor-level expert who appeared in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, it would not be a good piece of news for the World Spiritist Alliance. In fact, it would be bad news.

Time passed by very quickly. In a blink of an eye, it was already the next day.

At this moment, it was the time when the Cyanwood Mountain would announce the rules for this Nine Powers Hunt.

All the disciples who were qualified to participate in the Nine Powers Hunt, regardless of whether they might be from the Nine Powers or the other smaller sects and schools, were present. Even the elders and headmasters, the majority of them were also present.

Thus, Chu Feng’s great enemy Qin Lingyun was naturally also present. Furthermore, being a fellow disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain, he was even standing in the same location as Chu Feng.

However, perhaps it might be because there were a lot of seniors present, Qin Lingyun merely cast a disdainful gaze at Chu Feng and did not say much. He displayed an attitude of not placing Chu Feng in his eyes.

As for Chu Feng, he did not mind Qin Lingyun’s disdainful attitude. After all, Chu Feng knew very well that the current Qin Lingyun was nothing more than trash that he could take care of at any moment. He posed absolutely no threat at all.

“Look at that Qin Lingyun’s arrogant appearance. He must still be thinking that Chu Feng is still the same Chu Feng who was bullied and humiliated by him.”

Although Sima Ying and the others were not standing together with Chu Feng, Sima Ying was focused on the movements of the Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples the entire time. When she saw the gaze that Qin Lingyun looked to Chu Feng with, she was unable to contain herself and softly ridiculed him.

“When he discovers that Chu Feng is no longer the same Chu Feng from back then, that will be the time when he will regret,” Fu Feiteng also smiled. He had already come to know that Qin Lingyun had bullied and humiliated Chu Feng from Sima Ying.

“Bullied and humiliated Chu Feng? That guy bullied and humiliated Chu Feng before?” Hearing those words, Su Mei had a very emotional reaction.

“This does not concern you. Chu Feng is able to take care of it himself,” Sima Ying took a glance at Su Mei. Then, she said, “That’s right, why are you so concerned about Chu Feng? Could it be that you’ve truly fallen for him?”

“This does not concern you,” Su Mei said.

“You...” Su Mei’s response caused Sima Ying’s face to redden deeply. However, after that she rolled her eyes, she said, “How is it not related to me? I also like Chu Feng. Careful that I do not take the lead and snatch him first.”

“Pff, with you...?” Su Mei suddenly started to laugh.

“What’s wrong with me? Let me tell you this, I’ve known Chu Feng for longer than you. If I were to fight with you, there is no chance you could win against me,” Sima Ying threatened with an expression of complacence.

“Hahaha...” Hearing Sima Ying’s threat, Su Mei burst into loud, presumptuous laughter.

Not to mention that Su Mei and Chu Feng had known each other for many years, their relationship was also not something that Sima Ying could compare with. For Sima Ying to threaten Su Mei, she most definitely threatened the wrong person.

“Why are you laughing? Could it be that you do not know what it means to be in a crisis?”

“Go on, continue to laugh, I’ll let you know, I’ll show you exactly how I’ll win,” Sima Ying’s face had turned deep red. She was at her wit’s end and so angry that she started to stamp her feet.

When Lin Yezhou and the other disciples saw their power’s two most excellent little beauties fighting against one another for the affection of Chu Feng, they all displayed extremely awkward expressions. However, they found it extremely difficult to interrupt the two of them.

Feeling helpless, Lin Yezhou cast his gaze to Chu Feng. At this time, he discovered that Chu Feng was looking at two individuals.

It was a pair of exceptionally beautiful women. Furthermore, they were a pair of twins. These two beautiful sisters were truly very beautiful. Their facial features were very delicate, their height very tall and they also possessed very beautiful curves. The two of them could simply be considered to be perfect.

Especially the refined airs that they were emitting and their beautiful manner of dressing, the two of them simply appeared like celestial fairies. From a single glance, one’s heart would be tempted by them. When men saw them, they would not be able to contain themselves from taking several more glances at them.

“Junior brother Chu Feng, you are truly unconscientious. These two girls from our World Spiritist Alliance are fighting each other for your affection. Yet, how could you be taking a fancy toward this pair of beautiful sisters?” Lin Yezhou asked via voice transmission.

“Oh...” After hearing what Lin Yezhou said, Chu Feng noticed that Sima Ying and Su Mei were arguing with one another because of him.

After seeing that, Chu Feng merely smiled. He knew that Sima Ying was not interested in him and had only treated him as a friend. Thus, the two of them were merely arguing and not fighting each other for his affection.

“Senior brother Lin, please don’t use me to crack jokes. I merely feel that these two women from the Ten Thousand Flowers Garden are relatively special among the numerous disciples of the Nine Powers,” Chu Feng replied via voice transmission.

“Junior brother Chu Feng, you truly have good eyesight to be able to tell even that,” Lin Yezhou said. “These two girls, one’s called Nie Wan’er and the other is called Nie Xi’er. Not only are they twin sisters, they are also the two strongest disciples of the Ten Thousand Flowers Garden.”

“Furthermore, I can tell you this. The two of them are extremely powerful. It would not even be excessive to say that they are the strongest among all of the disciples present here right now.”

“During the Nine Powers Hunt from three years ago, the two of them joined hands and obtained first place. Furthermore, they obtained first place with absolute dominance.”

“This powerful?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was astonished. The reason why he had been observing this pair of beautiful sisters was because he had discovered that they possessed strength. However, never did he expect that they possessed the strength to sweep away all of the other disciples.

As they were also only rank nine Martial Kings, which meant they had to possess some sort of extraordinary method in order to accomplish this sort of feat. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Of course they’re powerful. Do you know why your Cyanwood Mountain’s number one disciple Qin Wentian has been in closed-doors training this entire time and has not even bothered to come out to participate in this Nine Powers Hunt?” Lin Yezhou asked.

“Why is that?” Chu Feng asked.

“That was because three years ago, he was utterly defeated by Nie Xi’er,” Lin Yezhou said.
