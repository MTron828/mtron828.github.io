Chapter 5447: Trustworthiness

“Just how much energy did he absorb for the scroll to emanate that kind of light? I really want to know what kind of formation will manifest from the scroll!”

The crowd was excited to see what was going to happen next. They could tell that the light determined how strong the formation was going to be, and Chu Feng’s scroll was emanating light similar to that of Saint Dragon Mark.

As a matter of fact, there wasn’t much energy left inside the Infernal Realm anymore. It had all been absorbed by Chu Feng’s scroll.

There was no doubt that Chu Feng’s scroll had reached the highest level in this trial. According to the rules, he should receive an extremely powerful formation in return.

Wu!

All of a sudden, Chu Feng revealed a pained look, and his hands began trembling. At the same time, the humongous scroll in the sky started shaking as well.

Putting the two together, it was obvious that something must have happened.

“Chu Feng seems to be struggling to control the scroll.”

Some amidst the crowd looked worried for Chu Feng, whereas the others gloated over it.

“Chu Feng, what’s the point of absorbing so much energy when you can’t control the scroll? That’s the price for your greediness!” Jia Lingyi sneered.

Chu Feng paid her no heed and continued wrestling for control over the scroll. How could he allow his reward to slip away from his fingers? The problem was that the scroll was so powerful that he struggled to suppress it.

His face quickly turned pale, and it didn’t take long for his mouth, nostrils, and ears to start bleeding. His muscles began twitching wildly as if he was facing the backlash of a terrifying force.

“Young friend Chu Feng, don’t force it. There’ll be many more opportunities in the future,” the World Spiritist Painter reminded.

He could see what was happening inside the Infernal Realm, and he could tell that Chu Feng’s life would be at risk if he continued trying to bear the backlash of the scroll.

However, Chu Feng paid no heed to the World Spiritist Painter’s warning.

“Grar!”

With a furious roar, he attempted to exert even more control over the scroll, but the scroll also retaliated with even greater force.

Bam!

There was a sudden dull thud, and Chu Feng exploded with a pop.

“My gosh…”

The crowd was horrified. Even the World Spiritist Painter looked dumbstruck.

Chu Feng had performed spectacularly in the trial. Even if he failed to grasp control of the scroll, no one could deny his talents. It was a pity that a prodigy like him had suddenly dropped dead. No one had expected such an outcome.

It was ironic how he had created such a powerful scroll, only to die over it.

“Hahaha!”

Jarring peals of laughter echoed in the sky. They were from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

“What a joke! Chu Feng made such a huge din with his scroll that I thought for a moment that he was a big deal, yet he ended up killing himself with that. Have you ever seen a bigger joke than that? Hahahaha!”

Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect mercilessly mocked Chu Feng’s death. His downfall was joyous news to them.

Soon, the crowd turned their sights toward the humongous scroll. It was still floating in mid-air without a master. Greedy glints flashed across the eyes of the juniors inside the Infernal Realm. However, none of them dared to make a reckless move after seeing how Chu Feng had died to its overwhelming power.

Shoosh!

All of a sudden, a person slipped into the Infernal Realm and flitted up to the humongous scroll. It was none other than the number one prodigy of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, Jia Chengying.

“Why is he slipping in at this moment? Is he trying to reap off Chu Feng’s effort?”

“How despicable! He didn’t dare to enter back when Chu Feng was still around, but now he wants to monopolize Chu Feng’s scroll!”

The crowd understood Jia Chengying’s intent. In particular, the juniors inside the Infernal Realm couldn’t stand his shamelessness. However, they couldn’t do anything about him.

As a matter of fact, Jia Chengying had released the full force of his spirit power upon entering the Infernal Realm, revealing his prowess as a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. He had made a breakthrough in his spirit power since returning from the Ancient Realm.

With strength rivaling a rank four Half-God level cultivator, there was no doubt that he was the strongest amongst the juniors present in the Infernal Realm. On top of that, his background also instilled fear in the crowd.

No matter how indignant the others felt, they dared not to defy him.

Jia Chengying formed a series of hand seals and tried to establish control over the scroll. However, the scroll suddenly jolted, and he was sent flying thousands of meters away. Fresh blood spewed out of his mouth.

Clearly, it wasn’t that easy to establish control over the scroll.

“What are the rest of you idling around for? Come in and help me!” Jia Chengying roared toward the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s warship. He was demanding the other juniors help him.

However, the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect turned to look at Jia Lingyi instead of entering the Infernal Realm. They still remembered Jia Lingyi’s earlier declaration that they wouldn’t take advantage of Chu Feng’s fortuitous encounter. They were worried that they would cross her if they went against her will.

“Chu Feng might have opened the Infernal Realm, but he doesn’t know his place. It’d be a waste to leave that scroll in there. Juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, heed my command. You are to enter the Infernal Realm and assist Jia Chengying in establishing control over that scroll,” Jia Lingyi ordered.

The ten thousand juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect immediately flew forth from the warship to enter the Infernal Realm.

“How shameless!”

The crowd scoffed in their hearts, but they dared not to voice their thoughts aloud.

Jia Lingyi paid no heed to the crowd’s views. She even looked at the World Spiritist Painter with provocative eyes.

“World Spiritist Painter, this is the will of fate. I hope that you aren’t unhappy about it.”

“Heh…” The World Spiritist Painter had already calmed down from his earlier shock, having seemed to have accepted Chu Feng’s death. “The treasure ought to go to the capable. Feel free to take the scroll if your Pill Dao Immortal Sect has the means to claim it. I only fear that you are overestimating yourselves.”

“That’s not a problem for you to worry about. You’ll soon see the superiority of our juniors. At the very least, they won’t lose their lives over the scroll,” Jia Lingyi scoffed.

The ten thousand juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect entered the Infernal Realm and began constructing a massive formation that was several times bigger than the scroll. The purpose of this massive formation was to aid Jia Chengying in gaining control of the scroll. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The massive formation was already incredible as it was, and its prowess was further enhanced under the control of a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist like Jia Chengying.

“As expected of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.”

Even those who looked down on the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had to concede that they were a formidable force. Many of them lamented that the Pill Dao Immortal Sect would be walking away with the scroll today.

“Activate the formation!” Jia Chengying roared.

The formation released a powerful ray of light toward the scroll, but much to the crowd’s astonishment, the formation wasn’t able to establish a connection with the scroll. In other words, the formation was completely ineffective!

But why would that be the case?

Jia Chengying was at least still able to try exerting his control over the scroll earlier, but why was the scroll no longer reacting now that he was supported by a formation?

“Fools,” a voice suddenly echoed.

The crowd hurriedly looked toward where the voice had come from, and they couldn’t believe what they were seeing. A person had appeared in front of the entrance to the Infernal Realm.

Chu Feng!

“Chu Feng isn’t dead?”

Jia Chengying was horrified. His eyes which were filled with confidence earlier swiftly gave way to fear.

“Chu Feng… you feigned death to lure us in?!” Jia Chengying exclaimed.

The crowd finally understood what was going on. It turned out that Chu Feng had feigned death in order to lure the juniors from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect into the Infernal Realm.

What Jia Chengying said next shocked the crowd.

“Chu Feng, spare me! I have nothing to do with your grudge against Jia Lingyi. I’ll apologize to you for what I did in the Ancient Realm. We have at least fought alongside each other at one point in time. I’m begging you, please spare me!”

Before Chu Feng could even say a word, Jia Chengying had already kneeled down out of fear. The crowd was baffled. Why was a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist like Jia Chengying afraid of a Martial Exalted level cultivator like Chu Feng?

“I don’t think you can shirk responsibility here. You are a member of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, after all. Besides, I have already stated clearly that I won’t condone any members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect entering the Infernal Realm.” Chu Feng looked at Jia Chengying with murderous intent dripping from his gaze.

With a wave of his arm, he released a powerful gush of spirit power.

A rain of blood splattered all over the sky. All of the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had been decapitated in the blink of an eye, including Jia Chengying. Chu Feng had massacred the ten thousand juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect with a single strike!

The crowd was stunned, especially the juniors.

They hadn’t thought that Chu Feng would kill the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect just like that. It happened so quickly that it felt as if he had been trampling on ants instead, but these were the prodigies of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, the future pillars that would support them!

Even Jia Lingyi was taken aback. She was struggling to process what had just happened.

Chu Feng slowly turned to Jia Lingyi and asked, “What do you think, Jia Lingyi? I am a man of my word, aren’t I? I said that I would kill any members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect that dared step in here, and I fulfilled my promise.”
