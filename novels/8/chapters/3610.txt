Chapter 3610 - Grand Protection Formation

How powerful was a True Dragon World Spiritist?

The world spirit techniques of a True Dragon World Spiritist possessed power capable of utter destruction.

The battle power of a True Dragon World Spiritist was comparable to that of a True God-level martial cultivator.

Just think about it. In a world where Utmost Exalted-level martial cultivators were kings, Half God-level martial cultivators were already akin to legends.

To encounter a True God-level expert, how exactly was Chu Feng supposed to contend against him?

It was no wonder that even the powerful Evil God Sword was unable to contend against him.

This was the power of the Ancient Era’s cultivators that stood at the apex of the martial cultivation world.

At that moment, Chu Feng was able to see that when the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s power entered the Evil God Sword, the Evil God Sword’s power was sealed away.

The crimson gaseous flames that had surrounded Chu Feng and the crimson gaseous flames emitted by the Evil God Sword had all dissipated.

Despair. Utter despair.

Chu Feng had experienced many confrontations where there was a vast disparity between his strength and the strength of his opponents.

However, that battle was most definitely the battle with the greatest disparity between his strength and his opponent's strength.

Even though the Evil God Sword was extremely powerful, it was completely powerless before the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

Chu Feng had originally thought that he might be able to scrape out a victory with the power of the Evil God Sword.

It was only at that moment that he realized how absurd and ridiculous that thought was.

“Chu Feng, do you know how weak and small you are now?”

“You should now know that you’re not qualified to possess the item within you, right?” The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s mocking voice was heard.

“If you wish to kill or torture me, go ahead and do so. Why bother with all these superfluous words?” After saying that, Chu Feng opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of spit.

The spit hit its mark, and landed on the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s face.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was not angered. After all, he did not intend to avoid the spit from the very beginning. If he did, how could Chu Feng’s spit possibly land on him?

“Are you venting your final bits of anger?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“The more you act this way, the smaller and weaker you will appear.”

“Those who are strong speak with their fists, and not with their spit,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“Are you going to kill me or not?” Chu Feng asked angrily.

“Truth be told, you are a talent. This old man admires everything about you. If it wasn’t for that little stutterer’s Four Fiends Divine Body being a perfect match for this old man, I would truly want you to become my vessel.”

“Unfortunately, you were chosen by it. Unfortunately, you obtained it.”

“It's something that this old man has yearned for day and night.”

“However, that doesn’t matter. This old man can possess it on your behalf. Go on and hand it over to me.”

“Even if you were to die, you will die an honorable death, a worthy death.”

As the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted spoke, he placed his palm on Chu Feng’s chest.

“Eeeahh~~~”

In the next moment, Chu Feng let out a miserable scream.

Even though the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s palm had only been placed on his chest, Chu Feng felt as if his palm had penetrated his soul.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was taking the power of the little girl from Chu Feng’s body. He was forcibly stripping that power from within him and seizing it for himself.

During the process, Chu Feng would inevitably die.

Death. This was truly death. Chu Feng was already able to sense the aura of death descending upon his head.

Die. This time around, he would truly die.

Faced with such a powerful existence, Chu Feng knew that no one would be able to save him.

Even if his father, his mother or his grandfather were present, they would likely be helpless when faced with such a situation too.

There was nothing that could be done. If anything, one could only blame Chu Feng for being so unlucky that he had encountered such a tyrannical existence.

Soon, Chu Feng had lost consciousness, and fainted.

As for his life aura, it grew weaker and weaker...

It could even be said that he was in a half-dead state.

He had already lost half of his life. Soon, his soul would be completely torn apart and shattered. With that, he would die completely.

He would die by the hands of that monster that had lived since the Ancient Era.

“Zzzzz~~~”

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning appeared on Chu Feng’s body. The lightning shone brightly, and appeared incomparably sacred. Most importantly, its aura was extremely powerful.

The lightning was spreading outward like an expanding spheroid. Soon, it had covered Chu Feng’s entire body.

Like armor, the lightning wrapped Chu Feng within it and sealed him away.

However, the lightning was no armor. It was still spreading. With devastating power, it was spreading outward. It seemed like it would bring about utter destruction.

“Oh no.”

Seeing that, the expression of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted changed enormously. He hurriedly pulled his hand from Chu Feng’s chest and retreated explosively.

Death. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted felt the aura of death from Chu Feng’s body.

If this were to continue, Chu Feng would not die, and he might end up dying instead!!!

Strangely, when the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted rushed back, the lightning that was spreading outward suddenly started to pull back. In the end, the lightning returned to Chu Feng’s body.

The lightning left no trace of its existence at all. It was as if it had never appeared.

However, it left a massive impression on the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“What a powerful grand protection formation.This aura… it’s not from my era. It’s the aura of a cultivator from this era.”

“Their cultivation is likely no weaker than the current me. In fact, it might even be above my own.”

“Exactly what is the origin of this brat? He actually possesses such an existence behind him? Furthermore, such a powerful protection formation was left on him?”

“Exactly who was it that set up that protection formation?”

“Void Sacred Tree, no one has been able to obtain your acknowledgement all these years. Why did you decide to choose this brat?”

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!!!”

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted started to scream in anger as Unreconciliation filled his voice.

He had originally thought that the power that he had yearned for day and night, yearned for years upon years, would finally be his.

Never did he imagine that he had underestimated Chu Feng. He had not expected there to be such a powerful protective formation on his body.

Everything he had hoped for was ruined by that formation.

If he continued his attempt to take Chu Feng’s power and kill him in the process, that protective formation would definitely unleash its true power.

The power of that formation was no small matter.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted felt great restraining fear toward it.

He felt that if the protective formation in Chu Feng’s body were to truly unleash its power, he might end up being killed by it.

Whilst it was also possible that he would be able to live, he had no certainty of either result. Most of all, he did not dare to take such a risk.

At the very least, he did not dare to take such a risk at that moment.

After being furious for a long time, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted finally calmed down.

He looked to Chu Feng again.

“Very well brat. So you actually have a protective formation left on your body by an expert. It's no wonder you’re so arrogant.”

“However, that’s no problem at all. Once this Exalted regains his true power, even that person behind you will not be able to protect you.”

“This Exalted is determined to obtain the Void Sacred Tree’s power. Before that, you can properly safeguard it for this Exalted.”

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted looked to Chu Feng with gritted teeth as he spoke.

He was not afraid of Chu Feng hearing what he had said. The reason for that was because he knew that the current Chu Feng was simply unable to hear what he had just said.

Thus, he was speaking his true feelings.

He was determined to obtain the power of the Void Sacred Tree by hook or by crook, regardless of the price.

Even if he had to massacre all living things, he must still obtain it.

Even though his memories were damaged and he was unable to remember things clearly, he still remembered the origin of the Void Sacred Tree.

The power of the Void Sacred Tree was something that he must obtain.

The power that Chu Feng and the three Zhang siblings imbued the black cauldron with was merely power that he had stolen from the Void Sacred Tree throughout all those years. That was not the true power of the Void Sacred Tree.

However, it was different for Chu Feng. He knew very well that within Chu Feng’s body, within his meridians and his blood, was buried one of the strongest powers in the entire world...

…the power of the Void Sacred Tree!!!
