MGA: Chapter 1848 - The Descent Of A God

“Could it be that our World Spiritist Alliance that has existed for tens of thousands of years will really cease to exist from today on?”

Faced with the devastation, tears of unreconciliation appeared in the eyes of many of the elders. They were so enraged that their bodies started to tremble.

To them, the World Spiritist Alliance was their home. Who would want one’s home to be ruined and one’s family to be killed?

“World Spiritist Immortal, I’ll give you another opportunity to decide. As long as you agree to serve our Dark Hall and reveal Chu Feng’s whereabouts, your World Spiritist Alliance will not only be able to come out from this unscathed, our Dark Hall is also able to help your World Spiritist Alliance become even stronger, and turn it into the head of the Nine Powers,” A rank two Martial Emperor that was the leader of the people from the Dark Hall said with a loud voice as he fought against the World Spiritist Immortal.

“Listen carefully, we do not know about Chu Feng’s whereabouts. And even if we did, we would not tell you. You can kill us, but you will not shame us. You all have already killed so many innocent people from our World Spiritist Alliance. You wish for reconciliation now? You’re truly delusional!” The World Spiritist Immortal was determined to kill them. After saying those words, his attacks grew even more ferocious.

“Truly refusing a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit. Since you do not know how to appreciate the kindness being shown to you, do not blame me for being ruthless.”

“People of the Dark Hall, listen up. You do not have to be lenient anymore. Today, I shall have this World Spiritist Alliance disappear from the Holy Land of Martialism,” The rank two Martial Emperor shouted.

Once he said those words, the people from the Dark Hall all shouted, “Kill!!!!!!!” Their enormous killing intent surged forth. Immediately, the sky darkened, and black clouds began to surge.

Their killing intent filled this entire region. Many elders and disciples were so scared that their legs grew limp and they fell onto their butts. They had lost the ability to continue standing.

At that moment, the battle power of the people from the Dark Hall all began to surge. The World Spiritist Alliance that was still able to barely withstand them before immediately sunk into an absolutely disadvantaged state. Even the World Spiritist Immortal was starting to be unable to withstand the attacks of the three rank two Martial Emperors.

In this sort of situation, the sounds of wailing and despair filled the entire World Spiritist Alliance. Not to mention the disciples, even the elders were unable to withstand the Dark Hall.

They were drowned in calamity. The killing intent of their opponents was no joke at all. They knew that it was not only them who would die today. The entire World Spiritist Alliance would also be destroyed today.

“Trying to extinguish the World Spiritist Alliance with merely you all? You’re not qualified.”

At the moment when a great amount of people from the World Spiritist Alliance had started to despair, a voice suddenly sounded from the entrance of the World Spiritist Alliance.

“What?” Hearing that voice, the people present were all startled and confused.

“Roar~~~~”

Right at that moment, a majestic fire dragon and a surging water dragon soared forth from the entrance simultaneously. They dashed toward the two Martial Emperors that were fighting against the Right Reverend.

“Ahhh~~~”

Everything happened too quickly. Before those two rank one Martial Emperors could react, they were devoured by the fire and water dragons. Immediately, their nonstop screams could be heard as their bodies began to be refined by the two dragons.

“What the hell are those?” Seeing that scene, the people from the Dark Hall were all alarmed. Not only were the water and fire dragons extremely ruthless, their auras also brought endless fear to the people from the Dark Hall. The reason for that was because the two dragons possessed the auras of rank two Martial Emperors.

“What’s going on? Where the hell did two rank two Martial Emperors come from?”

Seeing that scene, many people from the Dark Hall started to panic. The reason they possessed such an overwhelming advantage over the World Spiritist Alliance was all because of their Dark Hall’s three rank two Martial Emperors suppressing the World Spiritist Immortal.

Similarly, the World Spiritist Immortal had restricted the Dark Hall’s three rank two Martial Emperors from attacking others. As a whole, the reason why the Dark Hall was winning was because they possessed more experts than the World Spiritist Alliance.

However, two rank two Martial Emperors had suddenly appeared. To them, this was extremely detrimental. The state of affairs might even have a reversal because of this.

“Wha... what’s going on?”

At this moment, the eyes of many of the people from the World Spiritist Alliance who had been on the verge of despair shone with light. Although they were confused as to what was happening, they felt as if they could see traces of hope from the water and fire dragons.

“Roar~~~~”

Right at that moment, countless frightening howls sounded from the sky. Upon turning their gazes toward the sky, the expressions of the crowd present all changed enormously.

It was a group of golden-bright and dazzling ferocious beasts. Not only were they glistening with light, each and every one of them was several hundred meters tall. Some even surpassed a thousand meters. They were truly huge monsters.

These huge monsters, some of them possessed three heads and six arms. Some were grotesquely shaped. Each and every one of them was different from the next. However, there was one common aspect regarding them. That was, they all possessed the battle power of a rank one Martial Emperor. There was a total of several hundred of these ferocious beasts.

After those golden-bright and dazzling ferocious beasts appeared, they immediately charged toward the experts from the Dark Hall. With their mouths wide open and their claws sweeping forth, they began to frantically kill the experts from the Dark Hall.

Although the Dark Hall had dispatched a lot of experts, they numbered less than a hundred. Furthermore, other than the seven Martial Emperors, the rest of them were all only peak Half Martial Emperors. As such, how could they possibly be a match for the several hundreds of ferocious beasts?

In an instant, all of the peak Half Martial Emperors dispatched by the Dark Hall had been torn to pieces by the ferocious beasts.

At the same time, the screams from the two rank one Martial Emperors disappeared. The reason for that was because the two of them had been completely refined and killed by the water and fire dragons.

“Who? Who is it? Who dares to kill the people of our Dark Hall?” The remaining three rank two Martial Emperors from the Dark Hall all turned their gazes toward the golden sphere of light in midair by the entrance of the World Spiritist Alliance.

That golden sphere of light was incomparably gorgeous. In mid air, it was dazzling like the bright sun.

The several hundred golden ferocious beasts had all come from that place. Thus, they knew that the master of those beasts was within that golden sphere.

That said, while their tones were extremely arrogant, they were actually panicking in their hearts.

Their opponent had instantly eliminated all of the experts dispatched by their Dark Hall other than the three of them. This was sufficient to show how powerful their opponent was. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In fact, at this moment, the people from the World Spiritist Alliance were also looking at that golden sphere of light in the sky with stupefied expressions.

Compared to the three rank two Martial Emperors from the Dark Hall, they also wanted to know where those fire and water dragons, as well as the several hundred golden-bright and dazzling ferocious beasts, had come from.

However, regardless of who that person might be, they were all incomparably grateful to him, for he had rescued their World Spiritist Alliance.

“Roar~~~”

Right at this moment, the several hundred golden-bright and dazzling ferocious beasts were led by the fire and water dragons back toward that golden sphere of light. They stopped before the golden sphere of light. Then, other than the water and fire dragons, all of the golden ferocious beasts knelt in an orderly fashion before the golden sphere of light. It was as if they were displaying their allegiance to that golden sphere of light.

Many people from the World Spiritist Alliance were stunned by this scene. Overcome with emotions, they felt as if they also wanted to kneel down and worship that golden sphere of light.

Those golden ferocious beasts had been extremely powerful. They had already seen their might for themselves. How could they even be considered to be ferocious beasts? They were simply Divine Beasts.

However, at this moment, the Divine Beasts before them all displayed expressions of servitude. From this, it was evident to them how exceptionally powerful the existence within the golden sphere of light was.

“God, could it be that there’s a God who came to save our World Spiritist Alliance?”

“Could it be that our World Spiritist Alliance’s ancestor saw this in the heavens and returned to earth to save us?”

The disciples of the World Spiritist Alliance were all guessing. They all felt that a God had descended before them to save them.

This was not because they were ignorant. After all, to them, the existence in the sky was truly too powerful, to the point that it surpassed the capabilities of their imaginations. As such, the only way for them to describe that existence was with the word ‘God.’
