Chapter 5585: Something Huge Is Going to Happen

Jie Tian looked for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master as soon as Chaotic Era Scholar left to inform the latter about everything he had encountered in the Immemorial Star Sea, including his meeting with Chaotic Era Scholar.

However, he neglected to mention Chu Feng as he didn’t want the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master to know that he had lost to Chu Feng.

“There aren’t many survivors from the Ancient Era, but we have to be careful of those who are at Chaotic Era Scholar’s level. Tian’er, let me see the two paintings he gave you,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Grandfather, these are the paintings Chaotic Era Scholar gave me,” Jie Tian said as he passed the two paintings to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion MasterRêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Shoosh!

The first thing the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master did upon receiving the scrolls was to construct a protective formation. It was a small protective formation that only enveloped him and the scrolls, keeping Jie Tian outside.

The goal of the protective formation was to protect those outside from what was inside. He was worried that a trap was planted inside the paintings, so he was taking precautions lest a mishap happened.

Then, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master began using his means to examine the paintings. The more he examined the paintings, the more his wariness faded.

“You might not have gotten anything from the Immemorial Star Sea, but your encounter with Chaotic Era Scholar might be the fortuitous encounter of your life,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said as he returned the two paintings to Jie Tian.

“Grandfather, may I practice the cultivation method inside the painting?” Jie Tian asked.

“You may,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied with a nod.

Jie Tian was delighted to hear that.

He had already checked on the two paintings, and he didn’t find anything dangerous in them. Based on what he could see, the cultivation method would grant him a much better grasp of his Ruler’s Bloodline.

That being said, he trusted the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master a lot, so his heart was more at ease after the latter’s confirmation.

“How’s Xianhai Yu’er’s skills?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master suddenly asked as he glanced at the Immemorial Star Sea’s entrance stone monument.

While the Immemorial Star Sea was no longer around, its entrance stone monument still remained as if someone was intentionally announcing to the rest of the world that Xianhai Yu’er was the person who eventually cleared the Immemorial Star Sea’s trial.

Jie Tian’s face stiffened up. He was reluctant to answer the question, but he eventually said, “She’s the strongest junior in the present world of cultivation. I am currently weaker than her.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was surprised. “You haven’t crossed blows with Xianhai Shaoyu. How can you be certain that she’s stronger than him?”

“She’s definitely stronger than Xianhai Shaoyu, but rest assured, grandfather. I’ll surpass her in due time!” Jie Tian said confidently.

“You’ll definitely surpass her, Tian’er,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master nodded with a confident smile. “So, where do you wish to cultivate next?”

“Grandfather, I hope to cultivate in our Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Holy Land. I only lost to Xianhai Yu’er because my foundation is shaky. I wish to reinforce my foundation,” Jie Tian said.

“Let’s return then.” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master nodded in agreement.

“Grandfather,” Jie Tian suddenly spoke up, only to pause right after.

“What do you wish to say?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

Jie Tian hesitated.

“Speak your mind. There’s nothing you can’t tell me,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“Chaotic Era Scholar said that my own bloodline isn’t weak either. He said that it’d be better if I focus on developing my own bloodline,” Jie Tian finally spoke up, but his head was lowered in fear as he dared not to face the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

“Heh…” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master laughed. “There’s no question that the Ruler’s Bloodline is the strongest world spiritist bloodline. Tian’er, your own bloodline is formidable, and it’d be easier for you to grow with it, but your potential will be limited. While it’d be harder for you to develop the Ruler’s Bloodline, if you succeed in grasping it, you’d be able to achieve much more than you could with your own bloodline. Tian’er, Chaotic Era Scholar might be a powerhouse in the Ancient Era, but what he knows might not necessarily be the truth.”

“I also think that grandfather is right, which is why I chose to continue developing the Ruler’s Bloodline,” Jie Tian said.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master smiled brightly. He patted Jie Tian’s shoulder and said, “That’s my good grandson.”

He turned his attention to the crowd, who were still speculating about the disappearance of the Immemorial Star Sea. This was a huge matter that would rattle the world of cultivation, but there were very few people who knew the truth about it.

“Maybe it’s about time,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said as he took out an empty token containing incredibly powerful spirit power.

“Grandfather, what do you wish to announce?” Jie Tian asked out of curiosity.

“Some things have happened while you were training in the Immemorial Star Sea. There have been some hints from God’s Era, and we have to make countermeasures,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said as he inscribed words on the token.

Jie Tian watched as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master wrote something on the token. The more he watched, the more shocked he became, especially when he knew the token’s content would soon make its way all around the world of cultivation.

This would definitely shake the entire world of cultivation. It had been a hundred thousand years since the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion last did something like this.

…

Meanwhile, Little Fishy was standing inside an elegant warship, surrounded by 24 armored Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen who carried two tokens on their waists.

One of the tokens read ‘Immortal Sea’, whereas the other one read ‘Royal Guard’.

These 24 royal guards were stronger experts in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, and they had been tasked with the responsibility of protecting Little Fishy all this while. Little Fishy had just informed them about the happenings in the Immemorial Star Sea not too long ago.

“I didn’t think there would be a prodigy like Jie Tian in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. I have never heard of anything like this before. I wonder who’s stronger—Jie Tian or Ling Xiao,” one of the royal guards remarked.

“Who cares? He isn’t a match for our young miss anyway. I think Chaotic Era Scholar is the real threat here instead of Jie Tian. He’s the one behind the disappearance of the Immemorial Star Sea. It’d be foolish to underestimate him.”

“Even existences from the Ancient Era have started to awaken. It looks like God’s Era will be utter chaos!”

The 24 royal guards expressed their worry about the future, especially since enigmatic existences like Chaotic Era Scholar were threats to all powers.

In contrast, Little Fishy looked much more relaxed.

“Now that I have told you what happened in the Immemorial Star Sea, I’ll trouble you to head back and inform my father about it,” Little Fishy said.

“Your Highness Yu’er, what do you mean by that?” One of the female royal guards first noticed that there was something amiss with Little Fishy’s words.

“I’m not planning on heading back yet, so you need not follow me,” Little Fishy said as she took out a talisman.

The 24 royal guards simultaneously exerted their oppressive might to restrain Xianhai Yu’er and lock her in place. Their strength was so strong that she couldn’t even speak at all. However, she then sent a voice transmission to them.

“I should have told you that there’s no need for me to crush this talisman to activate it. I can activate it at will. You don’t have to worry about me. I’ll be right back,” she said before the talisman paper suddenly dissipated.

A powerful surge of energy enveloped Little Fishy, then she suddenly disappeared.

“This is bad.” The faces of the 24 royal guards turned pale.
