Chapter 5927: Place of Dao Comprehension

“Elder, may I know why you were looking for me?” Chu Feng got straight to the question at hand.

“I do require your help, but you don’t have the means to help us yet. I have heard about your affairs from our chief world spiritist, and I must say that you’re more formidable than I thought. As expected of Ranqing’s son.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Chu Feng was surprised. “Elder, you know my mother?”

“We have met a few times. I have a high opinion of your mother. You can consider us acquaintances. Feel free to raise any request if you require my help. As long as it’s within my means, I’ll do whatever I can. Also, please take this. It’s a gift. You have to accept it, or else I would be too embarrassed to ask for your help.”

Long Mucheng passed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.

“Elder, may I ask what you require my help for?” Chu Feng asked.

“I need you to help my Dragon Breath Clan grow stronger. This is not an easy feat, and you can’t accomplish this alone either. We need to find one more person,” Long Mucheng said.

“Another person? Who?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’d be great if you could help me look for that person.” Long Mucheng took out a pearl and passed it to Chu Feng. “This pearl will glow when you meet the other person.”

Chu Feng was intrigued. “What’s the condition to make the pearl glow?”

He inspected the pearl, but he had no idea how to activate the pearl.

“The pearl will light up if that person is within a radius of a hundred million meters. Given how huge the world of cultivation is, our undertaking is no different from searching for a needle in the middle of the ocean, which is why we haven’t found that person yet,” Long Mucheng replied.

“It’s only a matter of time,” Chu Feng replied as he accepted the pearl.

“Take this too.” Long Mucheng passed the Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng once more. “Don’t feel pressured by it. It’s just a welcome gift. That being said, you can reject any requests we ask of you. I don’t want to coerce you into anything on your mother’s account. However, I think you should be willing to help us, as there will be a handsome compensation if we succeed.”

“Thank you, elder.” Chu Feng accepted the Cosmos Sack before asking, “May I take a look around?”

This formation realm was massive. Chu Feng had missed out on many scenery as he had rushed here straight with Long Moxiao.

Of course, he had his motive too. This was a place constructed by Qin Jiu; he wanted to take a look around and see if he could comprehend anything.

“Of course.” Long Mucheng nodded.

Chu Feng began looking around, and this was indeed no ordinary domain. It was painstakingly constructed, and its beautiful landscape was merely the tip of the iceberg of what it comprised.

Everything here seemed to have its unique significance, just that Chu Feng needed more time to figure out how it all came together. He ended up spending many days touring the realm.

He wanted to comprehend the true intention behind the layout of this place, thinking that it would help the Dragon Breath Clansmen escape from this place as soon as possible.

On his nineteenth day in this formation realm, he finally grasped it.

“I get it now!” Chu Feng exclaimed.

“What did you comprehend?” Zi Ling asked.

The two of them had been looking around this formation realm together over the past few days. While she couldn’t offer any help to him, she wanted to accompany him. She was curious to know what he had comprehended from the landscape.

“Lord Qin Jiu created this place to overcome a hurdle in his spirit power. He created this place for his closed-door training. He should have succeeded in making a breakthrough, and this breakthrough likely has a special significance to him, which is why he kept it,” Chu Feng said.

“Young friend, you might as well have said nothing at all.”

A chuckle echoed. It was coming from a skinny old man with a goatee who resembled Long Moxiao.

Over the last few days, Chu Feng came to know more about the Dragon Breath Clan. This skinny old man was Long Mochuan, and like Long Moxiao, he was a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist. He was Long Moxiao’s older brother.

Back then, the two of them competed for the position of the chief world spiritist. Long Mochuan fell in defeat, but in truth, his skills didn’t pale in comparison to Long Moxiao.

“Lord Mochuan, what do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“Your explanation is as good as nothing. It doesn’t serve as meaning. You said that Qin Jiu created this place for his breakthrough. Do you have evidence?” Long Mochuan asked.

“I don’t,” Chu Feng replied.

In truth, he did have evidence. When he saw through the nature of this place, he grasped its true essence too. He knew how he could help the Dragon Breath Clan escape from this place now.

Chu Feng’s answer was as Long Mochuan hoped. A disdainful sneer crept onto his lips.

“How can you be sure my big brother Chu Feng is wrong?” Zi Ling asked.

She knew that the other party was much more powerful compared to her, but she couldn’t stand others looking down on Chu Feng.

“I don’t need to prove that he’s wrong. No one will trust him if he can’t provide evidence to support his conjecture. Jie Ranqing’s son, the inheritor of the Ruler’s Bloodline, you have quite a formidable reputation out there. However, young friend Chu Feng, I advise you not to be tied down by those empty titles. Don’t weave lies for the sake of flaunting either,” Long Mochuan sneered.

“What right do you have to say that big brother Chu Feng is lying?” Zi Ling roared in anger.

Chu Feng pulled Zi Ling back. He couldn’t be bothered to reason for Long Mochuan. In his eyes, Long Mochuan was not a powerful rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist but an ignorant old man.

Naturally, there was no reason for him to blow his top against someone ignorant.

Long Mochuan didn’t lose his temper despite Zi Ling’s outburst.

“I have taken a look at this formation realm; it’s just an ordinary domain. Do you think that the judgment of a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist is less credible than a God-cloak World Spiritist?”

Those were what Long Mochuan truly wanted to say. He couldn’t believe that Chu Feng could discern anything when he failed to do so. No matter how strong a God-cloak World Spiritist was, they couldn’t be any stronger than a True Dragon World Spiritist, including their perception.

Such was the deep-rooted notion in the world of cultivation.

But what Zi Ling said next caught Long Mochuan off guard.
