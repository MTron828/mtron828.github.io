Chapter 5797: Double Heavenly Lightning Bloodline

Weng!

Just then, a surge of teleportation energy appeared in the ancient hall and enveloped everyone. Chu Feng and the others were brought to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s square. Those who were alive were all here, including those who failed to enter the ancient hall such as Long Xiaoxiao.

A massive ranking board made out of spirit power appeared in the sky. It was the final result of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith.

The crowd was immediately drawn to the ranking board.

Weng!

All of a sudden, a surge of teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng, and he was transported to a monastery’s courtyard.

In the courtyard stood an old monk dressed in a simple kasaya. The old monk was small in stature, but he had a kind face. He held a string of prayer beads in his hands. These were the same prayer beads Liu Kuo had previously held.

“Master Nine Zenith?” Chu Feng asked.

“Benefactor Chu Feng, we have finally met,” the old monk said with a smile.

“Junior pays respect to Master Nine Zenith.” Chu Feng quickly bowed.

He recognized the other party’s voice. It was the same voice that had snapped him out of his trance when his bloodline had gone berserk.

“Benefactor Chu Feng, please spare me the formalities. Cough cough cough…” Master Nine Zenith was still smiling when he broke out into violent coughs that progressively worsened.

Chu Feng had also noticed Master Nine Zenith’s poor complexion, so he released his spirit power to check on the latter’s condition. He soon discovered that Master Nine Zenith was ailing from the trauma of an injury rather than an illness, and it would appear that the trauma was inflicted not too long ago.

“Master… did you suffer a backlash from aiding me?” Chu Feng quickly remembered how Master Nine Zenith’s voice had cut off halfway through as if something was obstructing him.

He had learned from Liu Kuo that while Master Nine Zenith could tap into the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation, he wasn’t its true master. For instance, the Nine Heavens’ Zenith had chosen on its own accord to head to Pulse Ignition Village and hold its trial here.

Master Nine Zenith was often powerless to intervene in the affairs of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. His injuries could be a backlash from interfering in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s trial.

“Benefactor Chu Feng, please do not worry about my injuries,” Master Nine Zenith replied with a smile.

Those words verified Chu Feng’s guess that Master Nine Zenith had gotten injured from helping him.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Master, you previously told me that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion didn’t take away my mother’s bloodline. Were those words a lie to make me compose myself, or do you have insider knowledge about what happened to my mother?” Chu Feng asked.

That was the thing he was the most concerned about at the moment.

“I can’t tell you much, but I’ll dispel your worries lest it affect your future cultivation. Benefactor Chu Feng, I beseech you to refrain from telling others what I’m about to share with you,” Master Nine Zenith said.

“I will keep it a secret, Master Nine Zenith,” Chu Feng said.

“I don’t know what transpired between your mother and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but I have inspected Jie Tian through the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation and discovered that his Ruler’s Bloodline isn’t natural. Only your mother has the Ruler’s Bloodline in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, so it made sense to think that her bloodline had been grafted into Jie Tian.

“However, Jie Tian’s Ruler’s Bloodline doesn’t contain any traces of your mother’s aura. I can’t make any guarantees, but at the very least, Jie Tian’s Ruler’s Bloodline isn’t from your mother,” Master Nine Zenith said.

That explained why he didn’t want Chu Feng to tell others about this. It was inappropriate of him to use the Nine Heavens’ Zenith’s formation to inspect Jie Tian’s condition. This was a sensitive affair too, since it concerned the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“Is that why you deduced my mother’s bloodline hasn’t been taken away?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s just a guess from this humble monk. I struggle to comprehend the hostility Jie Tianran harbors toward you, but I have seen how much he dotes on your mother. I have never seen him treat anyone the way he treats your mother. I don’t believe he would bear to strip your mother of her bloodline and ruin her future,” Master Nine Zenith said.

“Someone who’s used to getting his way wouldn’t hesitate to get rid of anyone who stands in his path,” Chu Feng said.

He saw Jie Tianran as an unscrupulous man who would resort to any means as long as he got his way.

“I can see why you see Jie Tianran in such a light,” Master Nine Zenith replied. “Benefactor Chu Feng, have you heard of Bloodline Bond?”

“Yes, I have heard about it,” Chu Feng replied.

“I once obtained a treasure harnessing amazing spirit power. If you enhance the treasure by imbuing a formation on top of it, you will be able to sense your bloodline power at a deeper level. It won’t aid you in your cultivation, but it may trigger a Bloodline Bond.

“Chu Feng, you should try sensing your mother’s bloodline power through it. If it works, you should be able to perceive your mother’s condition through the Bloodline Bond. That should give you the answer you seek,” Master Nine Zenith said.

He took out an ancient copper pot covered in runes from the Immemorial Era, followed by a talisman with a formation on it. It was likely a formation he had personally prepared.

Chu Feng could tell from the talisman that the formation was related to perceiving one’s bloodline.

“Benefactor Chu Feng.” Master Nine Zenith passed the talisman to Chu Feng.

“Thank you, Master Nine Zenith.”

As a world spiritist himself, Chu Feng knew what he had to do. He infused a tinge of his spirit power into the talisman, making it as sharp as a knife. He slit his wrist with the talisman paper before tossing it into the copper pot.

As soon as the talisman entered the pot, its formation activated, and it transformed into a transparent liquid reminiscent of water.

Chu Feng proceeded to soak his bleeding wrist into the copper pot, and the runes on its surface began revolving. Seeing that, he quickly closed his eyes.

He found that he could indeed perceive his bloodline powers at a deeper level, be it the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline or the Ruler’s Bloodline. Without any hesitation, he focused his consciousness on the Ruler’s Bloodline.

Through his Bloodline Bond, he could sense the state of his parents’ bloodlines, which indirectly relayed their respective conditions.

Everything proceeded smoothly.

Chu Feng soon sensed a bloodline aside from his. It was another Ruler’s Bloodline, and the bloodline felt extremely healthy. He heaved a sigh of relief.

Supposing Master Nine Zenith didn’t tamper with the formation’s result, what he was currently sensing should be his mother’s Ruler’s Bloodline. Given how healthy the bloodline was, it was safe to say that his mother was safe and sound.

That set Chu Feng’s mind at ease, since he didn’t think Master Nine Zenith had any reason to tamper with the formation’s result.

This meant that Jie Tianran had lied to him.

There was only so much he could sense from the formation, so Chu Feng quickly opened his eyes and retracted his consciousness from his Ruler’s Bloodline. He turned his consciousness toward his Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, hoping to sense his father’s condition.

“Hmm?” Chu Feng’s heart shook in astonishment.

Instead of being guided toward the nine-colored lightning in his dantian, he was brought to the depth of his soul, a place so deep that he was unable to access it. There, he found nine-colored lightning too.

He turned to his dantian and saw that there was nine-colored lightning there too.

If he wasn’t seeing things, it would mean there were two separate Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines within him!
