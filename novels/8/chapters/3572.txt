Chapter 3572 - Alive For A Million Years

“Rumble~~~”

After Chu Feng entered that dark black gate, he was drawn into a black vortex.

The vortex was so large that it enveloped both heaven and earth. Drawn into the vortex, Chu Feng was like an ant that fell into the sea. No matter how powerful he might be, he was unable to go against the flow of the vortex.

The vortex was not only surging with violent winds, but it was also bursting with lightning.

The lightning snakes reached a thousand meters in thickness and several tens of thousands of meters in length. They whizzed like enormous dragons as they split through heaven and earth.

Such lightning snakes numbered in the tens of thousands. They were galloping in the vortex and exploding with thunderous noises.

Being in the vortex, even Chu Feng felt fear and unease.

However, since he had dared to enter, it meant that he had already made his preparations. He was not only prepared to face dangers, he was also prepared to face death.

That said, Chu Feng did not think that he would undoubtedly die. If he felt that he would meet certain death, he would not have entered the gate.

The reason why Chu Feng decided to enter without any hesitation was not only because he wanted to save the Chu Heavenly Clansmen and his friends.

When he stood before the dark black gate, he had a feeling. He felt as if he was being summoned, as if some sort of power was calling to him.

He couldn’t be certain what it was. However, he was able to feel that whatever it was that was calling him did not hold any malice.

Thus, he felt that, the choice between his life and the crowd’s lives might be a sort of test. Thus, he decided to enter the dark black gate.

Although danger lurked on every side, Chu Feng was at least alive.

Although the violent winds were very terrifying, they seemed to be a channel leading somewhere. This further verified his guess.

Because of that, he gradually calmed down.

“Snap~~~”

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, a boiling hot white ray of light approached. It was a lightning bolt.

That lightning bolt struck Chu Feng’s body.

Everything happened too quickly. Before Chu Feng could even feel the pain, he had already lost consciousness.

......

When Chu Feng woke up, he thought that he would see the netherworld once he opened his eyes.

His reaction was understandable too. After all, the lightning strike was simply too powerful. At the instant he was struck, he felt that he would definitely be killed.

However, after he woke up, he decided that he was most likely still alive. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The reason for that was because the scene before him did not resemble the netherworld at all. If one wished to describe that place, it would be more accurate to call it a land of immortals, a paradise.

Chu Feng was lying on top of a field of emerald-green grass. Floating mountains and waterfalls surrounded the skies.

Even the skies of that place appeared particularly blue.

“You’ve awakened?”

Suddenly, a finger poked Chu Feng’s face.

The sudden poke jolted Chu Feng by surprise, causing him to abruptly get up from his lying position.

Upon closer inspection, he discovered that it was a little girl that had poked his face.

That little girl appeared to only be around six years old.

She had a chubby little face. Although she did not look particularly attractive, she was very cute.

This was especially true for her large eyes. Like two galaxies, they seemed to contain the stars of the sky, and were truly charming.

That said, Chu Feng did not dare to act carelessly around her. He was able to sense all of the creatures in his surroundings, including the flying cranes, the running deer, the hidden beasts, and even the cultivating monstrous beasts.

The only exception was that girl. Even though she was clearly standing before him, he was unable to sense her aura at all.

It was as if she did not exist.

The imprint present on the little girl’s forehead also made Chu Feng even more certain that she was very extraordinary.

It was an imprint of a tree.

Although the imprint looked very ordinary, Chu Feng felt that it greatly resembled the Void Sacred Tree.

“Little girl, what’s your name?” Chu Feng asked.

“Little girl?” The little girl rolled her eyes at Chu Feng. With her young and tender voice, she said, “I’ve lived for over a million years already. How old are you to call me little girl?”

Not only did that little girl look very young, but her voice also sounded very young.

Had it been someone else that heard her saying that sort of thing, they would definitely think that she was boasting.

However, Chu Feng did not think that way.

That said, as she had the appearance of a little child, even though Chu Feng knew that she was very extraordinary, he was tempted to tease her.

“Amazing. You’ve lived for over a million years? Wouldn’t that mean that you’ve existed since the Ancient Era?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re asking the obvious,” said the little girl.

“In that case, why don’t you tell me about the Ancient Era?”

“How come the ferocious beasts and demonic creatures of the Ancient Era still exist, but the martial cultivators are all gone?”

“Logically, even if they’ve reached the end of their lifespan, they should have descendants that lived on. Why did they all disappear?”

“Exactly what happened in the Ancient Era?” Chu Feng was extremely curious about the Ancient Era.

“That is a mystery known only to heaven. I cannot reveal it to you,” the little girl said with a very serious expression.

She was acting like a very astute and old immortal. That said, her appearance was clearly that of a little girl. Thus, acting like that, she looked like a little kid trying to pretend to be an adult, and was truly cute.

“A mystery known only to heaven? Nonsense. C’mon, tell me about it,” Chu Feng urged.

“Let me tell you this. You cannot be considered to be living right now. You are currently half-dead.”

“You are only able to be here for a year. If you are unable to leave this place after a year, you will die thoroughly.”

“Thus, instead of spending your time asking about those useless things, it’s better that you seize the opportunity to ask me what you must do in order to quickly leave this place,” the little girl said.
