Chapter 3364 - The Actual Demon Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief went as far as to kneel to Wuming Fenghuo for the sake of helping the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

Chu Feng firmly remembered that scene. He knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief really wanted to help the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

Besides, Chu Feng himself also wanted to help the Wuma Heavenly Clan. Thus... he decided to help the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief in helping the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

However, Chu Feng’s strength was limited. As such, it would be impossible for him to take on the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s branch clan, one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, all by himself.

As such, he had no choice but to take a risk and forge a fake title plate to keep the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s branch clan from using that title plate.

Once Chu Feng made up his mind, he immediately set upon the task, and immediately forged a fake title plate upon his return.

Chu Feng was confident in himself. He felt that unless it was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, not even the people from the Starfield Master Realm would be able to see through his fake title plate.

“Say, little brother, what are you doing?” Suddenly, a voice was heard. It was Bai Liluo.

The Chu Heavenly Clan had originally prepared a residence for her. However, she insisted on staying with Chu Feng. As no one could deal with her temperament, Chu Feng had no choice but to bring her back to his residential palace.

Hearing Bai Liluo, Chu Feng immediately put the title plate away.

“Don’t bother hiding it, I saw it. What’s this? For you to try to keep it from even your big sister, are you planning to use that title plate to do something shameful?” Blinking her innocent eyes, Bai Liluo sized Chu Feng up suspiciously.

“No no no, of course not. I’m truly not trying to conceal this from you,” Chu Feng scratched his head awkwardly. Since he had been discovered, he no longer tried to conceal the matter, and directly took out the title plate.

“I must say that you’ve made it look very real,” Bai Liluo carefully inspected the title plate in Chu Feng’s hand. Then, she looked to Chu Feng, “You’re planning to use that title plate to help that Wuma Heavenly Clan, right?”

“Mn, big sister Liluo is truly clever,” Chu Feng nodded.

“Pah! Kiddo, stop trying to flatter me. Who was it that was trying to hide this from me earlier?” Bai Liluo cast a side-eye at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng smiled and scratched his head awkwardly.

Indeed, he was trying to conceal it from her earlier.

“Exactly what is going on? Tell big sister,” Bai Liluo said.

There was nothing for Chu Feng to hide from Bai Liluo. Thus, he began to tell her about the problem the Wuma Heavenly Clan was facing.

“There’s actually such an unreasonable power? They’re simply trying to eradicate them.”

“Let’s go little brother. Big sister will accompany you and teach that bunch of shameless bastards a lesson,” As Bai Liluo spoke, she grabbed Chu Feng and began to walk toward the door to his palace.

“Big sister, I cannot allow you to take this risk with me,” Chu Feng immediately pulled away from Bai Liluo.

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s branch clan was one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

No matter what, his title plate was a fake. If he was able to deceive them, it would naturally be the best, but if he failed to deceive them, he would inevitably endanger himself.

He did not wish for Bai Liluo to take such a risk with him.

“What’s wrong? Are you looking down on your big sister?” Bai Liluo placed her hands on her waist and looked to Chu Feng with lips pouting.

“No, I’m not looking down on you, merely...”

“Haha, look at your foolish appearance. How could your extremely intelligent big sister not know that you’re worried about me?”

“However, little brother, you need not worry. The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s branch clan’s clan chief is merely a rank eight Exalted. Your big sister is capable of handling him.”

After Bai Liluo finished saying those words, she released her aura.

In the next moment, Chu Feng was incomparably astonished.

Even though he had known that Bai Liluo was very powerful, he had not imagined that she could be so powerful.

The aura that Bai Liluo was emitting was that of a rank nine Exalted.

Peak Exalted, Bai Liluo was actually a peak Exalted expert.

It was no wonder Bai Liluo would react with such disdain even when facing someone like Wuming Fenghuo. She actually possessed the same level of cultivation as him.

“Big sister Liluo, you are truly too powerful,” Chu Feng was extremely excited. Bai Liluo had truly given him a pleasant surprise.

“What’s there to be surprised about? Your big sister has yet to completely refine that animal. Once your big sister refines it completely, my cultivation will increase even more,” Bai Liluo said.

“Increase even more? Wouldn’t that mean your cultivation will reach the Utmost Exalted realm?” Chu Feng opened his mouth wide with shock.

Utmost Exalted realm! According to what the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had told Chu Feng, the Utmost Exalted realm was a level of cultivation attained by only few people in the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

The Utmost Exalted realm was a cultivation that could stand at the apex of the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Even someone as grand as Wuming Fenghuo was only a peak Exalted-level expert.

With that, what sort of status would the experts in the Utmost Exalted realm possess?

“Trifling matter, trifling matter. Calm yourself,” Seeing Chu Feng’s astonished look, Bai Liluo became very pleased with herself, and reacted as if it were nothing serious. Her appearance was truly adorable.

“My big sister, you should’ve mentioned it sooner. If I had known that I had you as my backer, I wouldn’t have spent all my effort to forge this thing here.”

Chu Feng pointed to the title plate in his hand with a depressed look. After all, he had spent quite a bit of effort to forge it.

Looking at it now, Chu Feng discovered that he had wasted his time and effort.

With Bai Liluo, there was simply no need for the title plate.

“You never asked me about it,” Bai Liluo rolled her eyes at Chu Feng.

“Okay okay, I was wrong, your little brother was wrong,” Chu Feng spoke with a grin.

Bai Liluo was his greatest backer at the moment. He couldn’t possibly afford to offend her.

Besides, Chu Feng was truly overjoyed. With Bai Liluo present, the Wuma Heavenly Clan would be saved.

That said, he still gasped with admiration. Bai Liluo was truly worthy of being a natural oddity that could disobey the rules of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Her powers were truly terrifying.

If a martial cultivator’s talent was excessively strong, they would not only be deemed a genius, but they would instead be deemed a demon level genius.

As for Bai Liluo, she did not need others to categorize her, as she was a natural oddity, a being akin to a demon, to begin with.
