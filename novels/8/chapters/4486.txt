Chapter 4486: The Surfacing of a Phenomenon

“Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, would an accident happen this time again? Will we stumble into some other power whom we can’t deal with once more?”

After learning about the Whitesky Star River, the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster teased with a joking tone.

“Definitely not, it won’t happen this time again. To tell you the truth, it was truly a stroke of coincidence that we happened to chance on the Whitesky Star River. It has been a thousand years since our Yu Heavenly Clan has dominated the Whitesky Star River, and many of our juniors have cultivated there over the years. I can safely say that no one other than our Yu Heavenly Clan knows about the existence of the hidden cultivation spot within the Whitesky Star River, so you don’t have to worry about being interrupted.

“The benefits of cultivating in the hidden cultivation spot are significant. If a prodigy like young friend Chu Feng were to enter that place, even if you aren’t able to make a breakthrough right away, I believe that it should build up a strong foundation that paves your way for a future breakthrough,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“I see that the Yu Heavenly Clan has indeed opened its arms generously to us this time around to share an invaluable cultivation spot with the rest of us. This exalted shan’t take advantage of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s kindness either. If our Monstrous Herd Temple were to find a suitable cultivation spot in the future, I’ll surely repay this favor,” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster promised.

“We have bonded together under young friend Chu Feng’s magnanimity, but I do hope that we can maintain such amicable ties with one another. There are simply too many threats out there in the world of cultivators, and having one more friend is much preferable than making another enemy.”

Following that, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the Supreme Elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect also expressed their willingness to share remnants or cultivation spots with the others if they were to find any in the future.

Somehow, it looks like the powerhouses of the Holy Light Galaxy were making use of this opportunity brought about by Chu Feng to form an alliance.

...

Having come to a decision, the crowd immediately set off toward their destination.

And soon enough, they arrived at the location of the Whitesky Star River.

The Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had indeed not lied to them. The area was completely barren, and there was no one to be seen.

It was just that after taking a look at the surroundings for themselves, doubtful looks surfaced on the faces of the crowd.

“I must say, Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, are you joking with us? Are you sure that this is the Whitesky Star River you spoke of? It looks very different from what you described to us,” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster expressed his doubt straightforwardly.

It was not for no reason that he was asking that for they were currently standing in the midst of a desert. A sandstorm was raging, and the weather so scorching hot that there was not a single plant to be seen in the region.

If one were to crack an egg on the floor right now, it would surely have been cooked right away.

The region they were in was considerably dangerous. An ordinary human would have been roasted alive as soon as he stepped into this desert.

It was no wonder why there were no other cultivators in the region. No one in the right mind would be willing to live here.

No matter how they looked at it, it didn’t seem possible for there to be a river here, let alone one as majestic and beautiful as the one mentioned by the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Calm down. It’s still night at the moment. You’ll get what I mean once morning comes,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

“Wouldn’t it just get hotter in the day? If it’s already sweltering at nighttime, it’ll be an inferno in the day. Putting aside ordinary mortals, even cultivators with lower cultivation wouldn’t be able to survive here!” an elder from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect voiced out his doubt.

“Everything will be clear once day comes,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief reassured everyone with a smile.

Seeing how calm he was, the crowd decided to ask no more. Instead, they began to anticipate what they would see in the day. They couldn’t help but wonder just how the river would manifest in the middle of this frightening desert.

Finally, a ray of light burst forth from the eastern horizon of the dark desert. A new day had come.

As the light began spreading all over the desert, the ferocious winds in the desert actually began to calm down, and the scorching heat within the desert started to die down.

Soon, the part of the desert began to sink.

After that part of the desert sank into the ground, a brilliant glow burst forth. A furious surge of water sprouted forth in the middle of the desert. Crashing down wave after wave, it swiftly formed a majestic river. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, what was surprising was that despite the furious waves, the water within the river remained extremely clear. What lay within the clear river wasn’t sand but starlight.

It looked as if the stars in the sky had fallen into the desert, creating a sight of ethereal beauty.

If it was already so beautiful in the day, it would surely be even more so in the night, with contrasting darkness to highlight the glow of the starlight. It was truly a pity that this Whitesky Star River only appeared in the day.

“What a beautiful river. The Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief has indeed not lied to us!”

“I really wonder just what kind of expert could have left behind such an incredible feat!”

Even the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and the other experts in the area couldn’t help but lavish compliments on the Whitesky Star River.

This was simply where the charm of the world of cultivators lay.

Often, there were enigmatic phenomenons occurring that really baffled and awed people, enticing adventurers to leap right into it.

“Young friend Chu Feng and fellow cultivators, eat this. Only with this pill will you be able to enter the hidden current. Remember, the medicine will only last for two hours, and you can’t take multiple dosage. So, you have to make the best of your two hours in there!”

The Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief took out a few pills that emanated the air of the Ancient Era. These pills were also incredibly beautiful as well, glimmering with faint starlight. They shared a similar aura to that of the Whitesky Star River.

The Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief gave these pills to Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao, Yu Hong, Yu Yin, Bao Yue, and the other juniors present.

While there were many juniors present here, only the top-notch geniuses of each power were qualified to enter the hidden current and cultivate in there. Such a limitation was required as the natural energies inside the hidden current was limited.

Chu Feng didn’t wish to waste any time. After he took the pill, he dived right into the Whitesky Star River.

Long Xiaoxiao, Yin Daifen, and the other juniors quickly followed him and entered the Whitesky Star River too.

As they dived deeper and deeper, the scenery around them changed. Fear began to creep into the eyes of Yin Daifen and the others.

They finally saw the hidden current inside the Whitesky Star River, but it was filled with countless ghastly white bones. Judging from the sheer scale, there had to be at least several hundred million of them in there.

To make things worse, none of these bones were unharmed. Nearly every single one of them had been severed into multiple fragments.

This vivid sight left them imagining just how tragic death these beings must have suffered for their bones to be reduced to such a state.
