Chapter 5471: The Opening of the Armory Hall

Long Yuhong lowered her head as her tears pattered down on the floor. Her pride and honor had been utterly crushed today, but there was not a single person who pitied her because she had it coming.

Even though Long Muxi was cold-natured, she would never oppress others with her strength and authority unprovoked. Long Yuhong was the one who let her ambition get the better of her and kept provoking Long Muxi.

“Brother Chu Feng, Lord Long Xu has permitted you to enter the Armory Hall together with us,” Long Chengyu said.

“He’s entering the Armory Hall too?”

The crowd looked at each other in astonishment. Even Grandma Jin and Long Huayue were taken aback too. Those who had previously looked down on Chu Feng began to see him in a different light.

They didn’t think that Lord Long Xu would permit Chu Feng to enter the Armory Hall. God Armaments were valuable treasures even to the Totem Dragon Clan. Only clansmen who had reached a certain level of standing would be granted the opportunity to try taming them. Most Totem Dragon Clansmen spent their lives never stepping into the Armory Hall.

Yet, an outsider like Chu Feng was actually granted such an opportunity during a time when a powerful formation was constructed around the Armory Hall to boost the chances of taming a God Armament.

This showed how highly the Totem Dragon Clan regarded Chu Feng.

“I’ll be troubling you, Brother Chengyu.” Chu Feng gratefully clasped his fist.

He could tell from the reactions of the surrounding crowd that this was a huge deal. It must have taken Long Chengyu a great deal of trouble to convince the upper echelon of the Totem Dragon Clan to permit this.

“There’s no need to stand on ceremony. We haven’t known each other for long, but I have a high opinion of you. If you don’t mind, let’s be brothers from this day onward!” Long Chengyu said with a chuckle.

“Of course!” Chu Feng accepted the offer. He thought that Long Chengyu was a decent person.

“Speaking of which, I heard that the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted opened its eyes for you. Someone of your caliber shouldn’t have any trouble with its test. What treasure did you get from it?” Long Chengyu asked.

“This.” Chu Feng took out his Lightning Flame Token.

“Lightning Flame Token? Why did you only get this?” Long Chengyu was taken aback.

“Is this one of the worse treasures in the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted?” Chu Feng asked.

“According to our records, the Lightning Flame Token is one of the rarer treasures, but its prowess is lackluster. It’s said to possess the power to obliterate all cultivators beneath Half-God level, and there are no requirements to invoke it, but that’s useless for you. Ey, I guess that you can keep it as a souvenir. What was the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted thinking? It opened its eyes for you, only to give you something like that,” Long Chengyu remarked in confusion.

“But Brother Chengyu, I don’t think that the Lightning Flame Talisman just works on those beneath Half-God level, right? Its potency changes according to the strength of the one invoking it,” Chu Feng asked.

“Sharp eyes! You’re right, but no one knows the way to invoke the talisman, so it’s practically useless in that aspect,” Long Chengyu replied.

“No one knows the invocation method?”

“Indeed. Our clan also thought that this treasure was formidable when it first appeared. The elder who obtained it brought it with him everywhere he went, treating it as a powerful defensive measure. Once, he encountered a powerful enemy and activated the Lightning Flame Talisman, but its power was only enough to destroy those beneath Half-God level. The enemy nearly laughed his head off.

“A few other clansmen obtained it subsequently. They were convinced that the Lightning Flame Talisman was a valuable treasure despite the precedent and kept it as their hidden ace, and they eventually found themselves in situations where they had to resort to it too. What do you think happened?

“Without an exception, all of them only exerted power able to defeat those of Half-God level and below. One of the clansmen died because of that. Brother Chu Feng, it'll be best for you not to trust the Lightning Flame Talisman too much. You won’t be able to invoke the talisman. It’s best to just treat it as a gimmick,” Long Chengyu said.

“With that being said, the Lightning Flame Talisman is still quite valuable. The weaker juniors are able to use it to protect themselves from threats. You should keep it for the time being. Our Totem Dragon Clan also treasures it too. Don’t worry too much about it. I have a feeling that you’ll get something good in the Armory Hall since you have reserved your luck here.” Long Chengyu patted Chu Feng’s shoulders.

Chu Feng smiled in response, but he didn’t say a word.

In truth, he had also received the invocation method when he obtained the Lightning Flame Talisman. Based on what he had gathered thus far, as long as he properly invoked the talisman, he should be able to obliterate any Half-God level cultivator too.

If he could fully activate the talisman’s power, he might even be able to put up a fight against True God level cultivators. That was easier said than done, but nevertheless, Chu Feng was confident of at least achieving a normal invocation.

However, he didn’t say that aloud.

He thought that the method to invoke the Lightning Flame Talisman was common knowledge, but it turned out that they didn’t know a thing at all. Since that was the case, he might as well keep this information to himself so that he could use it as an ace in times of danger. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was also willing to share the invocation method with Long Chengyu and the others too, but he had to first confirm that it really worked himself lest he sabotage them.

Long Chengyu was planning to invite Chu Feng to his palace for a chat, but they received news that the Armory Hall was opening. Thus, the crowd made their way toward the Armory Hall.

Those from the older generations were able to access the Armory Hall too as there was no age restriction imposed on it. However, a supporting formation had been placed over the armory this time around to boost the chances of taming a God Armament, and the energy contained in the formation was limited. In view of that, the slots were limited to only the most talented prodigies in the Totem Dragon Clan.

Everyone from the older generations chose to relinquish this opportunity for the sake of the later generation. This was also why everyone reacted so strongly when they learned that Chu Feng, an outsider, was allowed to enter the Armory Hall.

Soon, the crowd arrived before the Armory Hall.

It was nowhere as magnificent as Chu Feng imagined it to be. It was a palace built on a cliff, and it looked dilapidated. Nevertheless, Chu Feng could sense a powerful formation harnessed in the towering cliff.

Shortly after they arrived at the premises, the door creaked open.

A long corridor appeared before their eyes. A gust of wind carrying a hint of ancient and powerful auras rushed at the crowd.

The eyes of the crowd lit up in excitement, knowing that this was the God Armaments’ auras.

Under normal circumstances, the crowd would have rushed in to grasp this fortuitous encounter, but not a single junior gathered before the door dared to make a reckless move. After all, who would dare to make a move when Long Chengyu and Long Muxi hadn’t done so?

“Brother Chu Feng, I’ll be honest with you. The Armory Hall was opened for my big sister and I, so we’ll both be heading to the side hall. I won’t be able to accompany you there,” Long Chengyu told Chu Feng via voice transmission.

“Brother Chengyu, don’t worry about that. I wish you all the best in taming a God Armament,” Chu Feng said.

“Thanks,” Long Chengyu replied with a smile. He turned to the crowd behind him and said, “Listen well. Brother Chu Feng is an esteemed guest I have invited here. I won’t spare anyone who dares to disrespect him.”

Leaving that threat behind, Long Chengyu made his way to the side hall. Long Muxi glanced at Chu Feng before heading to the side hall too.

Once the two of them were gone, the juniors of the Totem Dragon Clan immediately dashed toward the Armory Hall’s main hall at the fastest speed possible. Chu Feng did the same too, knowing better than to squander this precious opportunity.

Considering that the Lightning Flame Talisman could only be used once, it would be much more helpful to his growth as a cultivator to obtain a God Armament. Naturally, he was determined to succeed here.
