Chapter 2302 - Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower

“What else did you discover?” Chu Feng asked.

“Do you know why I have only been searching for the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass at those several designated areas in the Fallen Goose Mountain Range?” The demonic woman asked.

“Why?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s because the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass only grows at those locations. However... they can only be discovered when illuminated by moonlight.”

“However, it remains that it is only ‘could’ and not ‘definitely.’ Searching for the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass is something that depends on luck.”

“In other words, the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass has always existed. However, due to their special nature, they are extremely well-hidden. It is extremely difficult to successfully find them.”

“However, today, not only did I find Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass, I also found Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower,” As the demonic woman spoke, she took out a special medicinal plant excitedly.

Upon seeing that medicinal Grass, Chu Feng’s heart was immediately moved. The reason for that was because the appearance of the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass greatly resembled ordinary Saint Spirit Grass.

Saint Spirit Grasses could be considered to be among the lowest level of cultivation resources. However, to the Nine Provinces Continent’s Chu Family, Saint Spirit Grasses were extremely precious items.

As such, when he saw the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass, he involuntarily recalled memories of his childhood. Thinking about it, back when he was in the Chu Family, when he was in the Azure Dragon School’s outer court, he was a weak individual with a relatively low level of cultivation.

Chu Feng was only able to become strong and embark upon the path of martial cultivation thanks to the Saint Spirit Grass that Chu Yue gave him.

Thus, at that moment, memories rushed into Chu Feng’s head, causing him to feel very emotional.

However, even though they possessed similar appearances, the size of Saint Spirit Grass was only that of a finger. However, this Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass was several tens of times larger than Saint Spirit Grass; it was very large.

As for their medicinal effects, they were akin to being the difference between heaven and earth. The two of them were simply incomparable. If the medicinal effect of Saint Spirit Grass was akin to a speck of dust, then the medicinal effect of Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass was that of a mountain. The difference between the two was Humongous.

Most importantly, the medicinal effect of the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass was all-inclusive. It could simply be said to be perfect.

The Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass’s leaves contained a very strong medicinal effect. Not only could they detoxify poison from one’s body, they also possessed the miraculous effect of prolonging one’s life span.

Most importantly, the medicinal effects of the leaves were simply too strong. Not only did the leaves seem to be able to remove the poison from Wang Qiang’s body, they seemed to be capable of removing all kinds of poisons. Chu Feng had never seen such a powerful medicinal effect.

The roots of the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass contained a dense amount of Natural Energy. It was so dense that even Chu Feng felt tempted by it.

Although the Natural Energy the root contained was very berserk in nature, Chu Feng was capable of refining it. If he were to truly refine it, Chu Feng’s cultivation might be able to increase further. After all, the Natural Energies were truly dense.

However, what captured Chu Feng’s attention the most was the flower on the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass.

That’s right. Between the leaves of the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass was a flower. That flower was very small; it was only the size of a fingernail.

However, that flower was already in full bloom. Furthermore, it contained a sort of miraculously strange light. Even Chu Feng was unable to describe what was so miraculous about that flower.

It was as if there were a vast world inside the small petals.

“Wow! What strong spirit power!”

Right at that moment, a sweet-sounding voice suddenly sounded by Chu Feng’s ears.

“Eggy?” Chu Feng was immediately overjoyed upon hearing that voice. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The reason for that was because that beautiful voice was something that only Her Lady Queen possessed.

Filled with excitement, Chu Feng hurriedly cast his awareness to his world spirit space. Sure enough, Her Lady Queen was awake. She was still as beautiful and alluring as she was before.

“Eggy, you’ve awakened?” Chu Feng was very excited.

“Originally, I planned to sleep for a bit longer. After all, I did not wish to waste your kind intentions. However, that flower is truly too enticing. As such, this Queen is unable to continue to sleep,” Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile. It could be seen that her current mood was very good.

The reason why Her Lady Queen was so happy was not only because of the fact that she had slept comfortably.

Most importantly, it was because she was attracted by the flower of that Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass.

The reason for that was because that mysterious flower not only emitted extremely strong spirit power, it also emitted very dense source energy.

In other words, not only was this flower extremely useful to world spiritists, it was also extremely enticing to world spirits.

In other words, the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass was capable of increasing one’s cultivation, increasing one’s spirit power, and increasing one’s world spirit’s power. It was also capable of curing tens of thousands of poisons, and increasing one’s lifespan. That Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass was simply a priceless treasure.

“Chu Feng, let me out. I am going to refine that Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower,” Eggy said impatiently.

“No, this Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass is something that that demonic woman has prepared for Wang Qiang. We cannot use it.”

“Furthermore, other than its medicinal effect, the rest of the power contained in the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass is all berserk in nature and difficult to refine,” Chu Feng said.

Eggy sighed. “Okay then,” After hearing what Chu Feng said, Eggy no longer said anymore.

However, Chu Feng was able to tell from Eggy’s tone that she was unwilling to give up. Thus, he said, “Eggy, in the future, I will definitely find you treasures that will increase your cultivation.”

“Got it. This Queen believes in you. Don’t think too much, and just properly heal that stutterer,” Eggy smiled sweetly and made a gesture of indifference.

At that moment, the demonic woman deliberately asked Chu Feng, “Hey! You’re also an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, are you able to tell how powerful this Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower is?”

“This Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower contains very strong spirit power. It is extremely useful for world spiritists. Furthermore, if one is able to extract the spirit power properly, it will increase the cultivation of one’s world spirit,” Chu Feng said.

“What you said is only a general idea. The Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower contains enough energy that it could instantly turn my husband into an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,” The demonic woman said excitedly.

“Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” Chu Feng felt very astonished. Although Chu Feng was able to tell that the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower was very powerful, he did not expect it to be that powerful.

“That’s right, it’s an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. My husband is, after all, a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. He is but a short distance away from becoming an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

“With the power contained in this Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower, it will be sufficient to allow him to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,” The demonic woman said excitedly.

At that moment, Chu Feng finally discovered the reason why the demonic woman would be so excited. It turned out it was because the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower was capable of helping Wang Qiang become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Originally, I deeply detested that damned old man. However, it would seem that I would have to thank him now.”

“If it wasn’t for him snatching away my Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass, I would not have continued to search for more Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass. If I hadn’t continued to search, I would not have encountered this Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower.”

“If I didn’t encounter this Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower, my husband would not have obtained the opportunity to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,” The demonic woman said in a very excited manner.

“Wait, you said it’s an opportunity?” Chu Feng revealed an astonished expression. He asked, “Are you saying that you do not have absolute certainty in being able to help Wang Qiang become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?”

“Of course not. Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flowers are no ordinary flowers. They possess another name, the Starlit Key,” The demonic woman said.

“Starlit Key?” Chu Feng grew more curious.

“That’s right. They’re known as Starlit Keys. The reason for that is because it is possible to open a Starlit Gate when using the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flowers,” That demonic woman said.

“Starlit Gate? What is that?” Chu Feng asked.

“The Starlit Gate is the gate that leads to the Starlit Path.”

“As for that Starlit Path, it is a path that can traverse the starry sky, allowing one to move from one Starfield to another.”

“In short, it is a very dangerous place. At the very least, with our cultivation, it will be very difficult for us to survive should we enter that place,” The demonic woman said.

“Never would I have expected that the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower would have such a miraculous effect,” Chu Feng felt that the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower was even more miraculous.

Starfields were extremely vast. A single Starfield would possess countless worlds. For something to be able to allow one to traverse the Starfields in the starry sky, it would most definitely be extraordinary.

“Chu Feng, there’s no time to delay. We must cure my husband of his poison first. After that, we can use the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower, and see whether or not my husband will be able to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist with it,” That demonic woman said.

“Very well,” Chu Feng nodded. As he was Wang Qiang’s brother, he would naturally want to cure Wang Qiang from the poison sooner more than anyone else.

“W-wait a m-moment,” However, right at that moment, Wang Qiang, who had been feigning unconsciousness, suddenly sat up and waved his hand.
