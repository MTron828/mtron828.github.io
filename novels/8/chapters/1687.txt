MGA: Chapter 1687 - Astonishingly Powerful

It turned out that those black-clothed individuals with skulls on their backs were from a power called the Black Fiend. As for this Black Fiend, it was a very notorious power. It could be said that they had committed all imaginable crimes.

Especially their two leaders, the Black and White Skulls. The two of them were said to be on their way to becoming the Holy Land of Martialism’s sixth and seventh Great Evildoers.

For the reputation and title of the sixth and seventh Great Evildoer, the Black and White Skulls had led the Black Fiend to commit malicious deeds all over in recent years. They had become the target of elimination for many powers.

The Black Fiend had come to cause trouble for the Luo Family with an objective. They wanted to obtain the inherited treasure of the Luo Family, the Invisible Dew.

The Luo Family had not been willing to hand the Invisible Dew to them. Thus, the Black Fiend sent people to launch a surprise attack at Luo Huan and the others. Luo Huan felt that, with the way the Black Fiend did things, this would only be the beginning.

Likely, in the near future, the Black Fiend would lead their main forces to their Luo Family. At that time, if they were still unwilling to hand the Invisible Dew over to them, what would await the Luo Family would be a calamity capable of destroying their entire family.

“As those Black and White Skulls actually dared to declare themselves to be the existences who will become the sixth and seventh Great Evildoers, they are most definitely not people to be trifled with.”

“The way I see it, the people the Black Fiend dispatched to attack you all today are merely shrimp soldiers and crab generals. They were merely sent to test out your strength.”

“If they are to come again, there will definitely be Half Martial Emperors in their ranks. With the strength of your Luo Family, you all will definitely be no match for the Black Fiend,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s true. We also know that we are no match for the Black Fiend. That is why we have been requesting that my father hand over the Invisible Dew to them the entire time. However, my father is very stubborn, and he refuses to hand the Invisible Dew over no matter what,” When speaking of this matter, Luo Huan had a very worried and uneasy appearance. This could not be blamed on her. When a great catastrophe was about to befall someone, when one’s death was before them, how many people would be able to keep calm without fear?

“Exactly what is that Invisible Dew? Is it more important than the survival of your Luo Family?” Du Wanwu asked.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to smile. It was one thing for others to say words like those. However, Du Wanwu actually said those words.

Back then, Chu Feng had only wanted Du Wanwu to change the rules and coexist with the villagers of the Poison Demon’s Valley peacefully.

Yet, Du Wanwu declared that he could not change the rules left behind by his ancestor, and stubbornly refused to comply with Chu Feng’s demand. In fact, he did not even hesitate even when death was placed before him.

Compared to the Luo Family, Du Wanwu was evidently an individual who was much more stubborn with rules.

If Luo Huan were to know that Du Wanwu was such a person, yet he still had the nerve to talk about them being stubborn, Chu Feng truly wondered what sort of reaction Luo Huan would have.

“Benefactor, you all do not know about this. Although that Invisible Dew has a pleasant sounding name, it is actually a very powerful poison. It is colorless and odorless. Even Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists will not be able to detect it.”

“Even though the Invisible Dew is likely not a fatal poison, it is capable of causing paralysis for a period of time. If one is paralyzed, one will no longer have the capability to defend oneself. If the person using the poison had the intention to kill, then the person poisoned will definitely die.”

“With how notorious the Black Fiend is, they most definitely have not planned to use our Luo Family’s Invisible Dew for good deeds. If they are to obtain our Invisible Dew, countless people will end up suffering.”

“My father believes that we simply should not help the evildoers. Thus, he is unwilling to hand over the Invisible Dew,” Luo Huan explained.

“So that’s the case. Since that is the case, why do you all not flee?” Du Wanwu asked.

“Our Luo Family’s Ancestor left a rule that our Luo Family shall live and die with this place. Thus, we will not escape,” Luo Huan said.

“Adherence to old ideas,” Chu Feng sneered. He felt that the Luo Family was truly unsuitable to live in this sort of world.

“Benefactor, what you said is extremely correct. My father is indeed someone who adheres to old ideas. Unfortunately, we are unable to persuade him,” Luo Huan laughed bitterly. She did not blame Chu Feng for saying those words. Instead, she agreed with him completely.

“I wish to ask, how did that Black Fiend come to know of your Luo Family’s Invisible Dew, your Luo Family’s inherited treasure?” Chu Feng asked.

“Someone from our Luo Family blurted it out after drinking too much,” Luo Huan said.

“In that case, has the Black Fiend seen your Luo Family’s Invisible Dew for themselves?” Chu Feng asked.

“No,” Luo Huan shook her head.

“In that case, wouldn’t the problem be solved should you all insist that you do not have the Invisible Dew?” Du Wanwu interrupted.

“If it were that simple, the Black Fiend would not have come to attack us. With the way the Black Fiend handle things, even if our Luo Family insists that we do not possess the Invisible Dew, they will definitely not believe us.”

“The Black Fiend was determined to see the Invisible Dew. If he could not see it, he would eliminate the Luo Family,” Chu Feng guessed.

“What Benefactor Feng Xing says is very correct. Back then, when the Black Fiend sent people over to our Luo Family to demand for the Invisible Dew, my father had said that our Luo Family did not possess any Invisible Dew. In fact, he even publicly killed that person from our Luo Family who had blurted about the Invisible Dew after drinking too much.”

“However, the people from the Black Fiend only laughed at us and left behind these words, ‘Hand over the Invisible Dew within ten days. Otherwise, the Luo Family shall vanish from the face of this earth.’” Luo Huan said.

“As expected, they are vicious and merciless,” Du Wanwu sighed upon hearing those words. A trace of anger emerged in his eyes.

“Since they have not seen the Invisible Dew before, I have a method that can be used to deceive them,” Chu Feng said.

“What method do you have?” Hearing those words, Du Wanwu and Luo Huan asked together. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I am proficient with world spirit techniques, while Du Wanwu is proficient with poison techniques. It shouldn’t be hard for the two of us to create a fake Invisible Dew,” After saying those words, Chu Feng looked to Du Wanwu and asked, “What do you think?”

“Indeed, we can try that out,” Du Wanwu nodded. As a descendant of the Poison Demon, he was very confident in his poison techniques.

“Benefactors, is that true? Is that really feasible?” Luo Huan was overjoyed to hear those words. In fact, she was feeling a slight bit of disbelief. It was as if she had seen the dawn of a new era, seen the light of hope.

“Unless that Black Fiend possesses Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, they will definitely not be able to discover that the Invisible Dew we created is fake,” Chu Feng said.

“That would truly be great!” Hearing those words, the joy on Luo Huan’s face grew even stronger.

“Don’t be happy too quickly. I feel that even if your Luo Family is to hand over the Invisible Dew, you will still not be able to escape from this calamity,” Chu Feng said.

“Benefactor, what do you mean by that?” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Luo Huan’s expression changed. Not only her, even Du Wanwu was currently looking at Chu Feng with a confused expression.

“With the way a power like the Black Fiend does things, even if you all are to hand over the Invisible Dew to them, they will likely still kill you all in order to silence you and prevent the matter regarding the Invisible Dew from spreading,” Chu Feng said.

“This... in that case, our Luo Family will really be unable to escape this calamity,” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Luo Huan stepped back several steps, and her complexion turned as pale as paper. The joy on her face had completely turned to an expression of depression.

“Feng Xing, since you already know that the they are such ruthless people, why would you suggest making a fake Invisible Dew with me? Isn’t that completely unnecessary?” Du Wanwu asked.

“Du Wanwu, let me ask you this. Since the Luo Family showed kindness to your Ancestor, and your Ancestor left instructions to help the Luo Family, you will definitely not sit and watch without doing anything, you will definitely protect the Luo Family, isn’t that right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Right,” Du Wanwu nodded.

“With your temperament, even if you are to die, you will not cower, isn’t that right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Right,” Du Wanwu nodded.

“In that case, you must be prepared to cause a massacre, isn’t that right?” Chu Feng asked again.

“Right,” Du Wanwu nodded again.

“However, one must possess justifications for killing others. Otherwise, we will become criminal elements equal to the Black Fiend.”

“Firstly, the Black Fiend is a power that has caused countless evils, a power that everyone wants to eliminate. Thus, we have justification for killing them.”

“Secondly, the Black Fiend have come to threaten the Luo Family. What we are doing is merely self-defense. Thus, we have even more justification for killing them.”

“However, it remains that they have made a demand. Thus, if we are to hand the Invisible Dew to them, and they still insist on attacking the Luo Family, we will have even more abundant justification for killing them.”

“Of course, my guess earlier is merely a possibility. If possible, I would like to be able to solve this problem with the Invisible Dew.”

“If that Black Fiend decides not to slaughter the Luo Family after obtaining the Invisible Dew, if we can protect the Luo Family without killing, wouldn’t that be even better?” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“You are very correct,” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Du Wanwu nodded his head again. At this time, he had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng, because everything that Chu Feng had said was so reasonable that he could not find any fault to refute with.

When even Du Wanwu had acted like this, the gaze which Luo Huan looked to Chu Feng with became even more complicated.

It was one thing for Chu Feng to be a Half Martial Emperor at his young age. However, Chu Feng was actually this cool-headed and calm in the manner he handled things. In merely a short moment, he had thought of all these things and analyzed everything so thoroughly.

This was something impossible for Luo Huan. Not to mention her, likely even her father, the grand Family Head of the Luo Family, would not be able to accomplish what Chu Feng had.

This young man was truly astonishingly powerful.
