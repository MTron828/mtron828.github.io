MGA: Chapter 1603 - Not A Pushover

Once this voice was heard, a region of the crowd immediately became chaotic. A gale surged forth. Like rice straws, the people were being scattered all over the place. A road was forcibly created from amidst the crowd.

On the other side of the road, a group of people were walking over aggressively with large strides.

They were the people from the Beitang Imperial Clan. They were still being led by Beitang Zimo. However, there were a lot more people from the Beitang Imperial Clan here when compared to the ones he had met on the Immortal Island.

At this moment, the Beitang Imperial Clan was not only limited to experts of the younger generation. There were also experts from the older generation among their ranks. There were over twenty people with peak Half Martial Emperor-level cultivations like Hong Qiang. Furthermore, there was a Martial Emperor among them too.

That Martial Emperor was a man, a black-haired middle-aged man. However, Chu Feng knew that his middle-aged appearance was most definitely not the true age of this man. Most importantly, this Martial Emperor was also looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with malice.

At this moment, Chu Feng started frowning. He had known the situation was bad the moment he heard Beitang Zimo’s voice.

This Beitang Zimo was a stereotypical vile, little man. Furthermore, he was the shameless type. He had been publicly humiliated by Chu Feng on the Immortal Island. For him to guard this place and wait for Chu Feng, it was clear that he had done so with the intention of taking revenge on Chu Feng.

“What are you all planning to do?” Seeing that the situation was bad, Hong Qiang hurriedly stepped forth and blocked Chu Feng.

“This does not concern you,” Right at this moment, that Martial Emperor from the Beitang Imperial Clan suddenly attacked. With a wave of his sleeve, his boundless power surged forth and directly blew Hong Qiang to the side.

Even though Hong Qiang was powerful, it remained that he was only a peak Half Martial Emperor. Before Martial Emperors, he would also collapse at the first blow without the ability to resist at all.

“Beitang Zhiqiang, you are truly impressive. To bully a Half Martial Emperor when you’re a Martial Emperor, do you not feel shame?”

Right at this moment, a gentle yet powerful aura suddenly appeared and surrounded Hong Qiang, preventing him from being injured and allowing him to safely land with his feet on the water’s surface.

At the same time, another group appeared. It was the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan. Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli were all present. Most importantly, that Martial Emperor-level woman was also present. It was her who had helped Hong Qiang earlier.

“Nangong Lian, are you planning to meddle in other people’s business?” Seeing that the Nangong Imperial Clan had interfered, that Beitang Imperial Clan’s Martial Emperor, Beitang Zhiqiang, started to frown. A trace of displeasure flashed through his eyes.

[1. Nangong Lian → Nangong Lotus... seems like the Nangong Imperial Clan’s women are all named after flowers? Maybe not Bai Ruochen...]

“Meddle in other people’s business? You are gravely mistaken in that assumption. Little friend Chu Feng is someone who has helped my clan’s young master and young misses. Right now, there is someone who is trying to create trouble for him. It’s only natural for me to help him. As such, how could it possibly be considered to be meddling in another’s business?” Nangong Lian said with a beaming smile.

“Heh, I had already anticipated that you people from the Nangong Imperial Clan would interfere. However, I might as well tell you this. Today, I insist on teaching this Chu Feng a lesson. Even if your Nangong Imperial Clan interferes, I will still show no mercy.”

Beitang Zhiqiang narrowed his sharp sword brows and spoke with arrogance. It seemed that he was already prepared for the Nangong Imperial Clan stepping in to help Chu Feng. Today, he was insistent on taking care of Chu Feng and sticking up for Beitang Zimo.

“What if our King Monstrous Beast Race were to join too?” However, right at this moment, an extremely coarse and loud voice exploded from the crowd. Another group of people appeared. It was the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. Yaojiao Tingyu was also present. However, the most important matter was that beside Yaojiao Tingyu was a burly, dark skinned man.

This burly man was four meters tall. He looked like a giant standing in the crowd. Explosive power was being emitted from all over his body. It was martial power, Emperor-level martial power. There was no need to doubt that this person was also a Martial Emperor. Furthermore, he was a monstrous beast on top of that.

“King Monstrous Dragon Beasts? You all are planning to interfere too?” While Beitang Zhiqiang would not be afraid if it were only a single Nangong Imperial Clan, the arrival of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts caused him to hesitate.

To fight against two on his own would mean that he would not be a match for them in any aspect. To him, this turn of events was far from good.

However, he was skeptical, and confused as to why the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts that disliked being involved with humans would help that Chu Feng. This was simply abnormal.

In fact, it was not only Beitang Zhiqiang who was thinking this way. The lot of people present were also thinking that way. The crowd was already discussing it spiritedly. They were guessing as to whether the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were casually saying those words, or were really planning to help Chu Feng.

If the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts really planned to help Chu Feng, then this would be an enormous commotion. At the very least, this would mean that Chu Feng’s charisma would be unimaginably grand.

“Chu Feng is my friend. If you dare to touch him, you will be going against our King Monstrous Dragon Race,” Yaojiao Tingyu spoke with a loud voice. She had answered the question the crowd had. The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were truly planning to help Chu Feng. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“......” Hearing those words, not only did Beitang Zhiqiang start to frown and grow silent, even Beitang Zimo, and the rest of the Beitang Imperial Clan grew silent as well.

The thing that they didn’t wish to happen the most had happened. The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts really planned to face their Beitang Imperial Clan as enemies for a single Chu Feng.

In truth, if they were to fight against the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts one on one, the Beitang Imperial Clan would naturally not be afraid of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. However, at this moment, there was also the Nangong Imperial Clan. If the two of them were to join hands, their Beitang Imperial Clan would be no match for them at all.

“Heh, no wonder Chu Feng is this composed. It seems that he had already enticed relationships and found helpers.”

“Very well, we shall wait and see. While they can protect you once, I shall see if they can protect you forever.”

Beitang Zimo spoke. He knew that there was no way for him to do anything to Chu Feng in the current situation. Thus, he could only give up. After saying those words, Beitang Zimo waved his sleeve, turned confidently around, and proceeded to lead his Beitang Imperial Clan away.

“Wait.” However right at this moment, Chu Feng spoke.

Chu Feng was not a pushover. With how the Beitang Imperial Clan had tried to make things difficult on him before such an enormous crowd, nearly injuring Hong Qiang in the process, how could Chu Feng possibly leave the matter at that? Even if his opponent was the Beitang Imperial Clan, Chu Feng would still not let them get away with it.

“What? Could it be that you want to make me stay? Do you have the ability to do so?” Seeing that Chu Feng had called for him to stop, Beitang Zimo showed no fear. That was because he knew that if they did not attack Chu Feng, the Nangong Imperial Clan and the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts would definitely not take the initiative to attack them first.

If Chu Feng did not have the protection of the Nangong Imperial Clan and the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, how could he possibly fear a mere Chu Feng?

“Beitang Zimo, I wish to know why you keep provoking me again and again. I seemed to recall that I have not wronged you in any manner,” Chu Feng asked with a feigned confusion.

“That’s right. Why does the Beitang Imperial Clan insist on creating trouble for Chu Feng?”

After Chu Feng’s words left his mouth, the surrounding crowd also began to spiritedly discuss this matter. The crowd were focused on watching the show, and had not thought about when or why the conflict between the Beitang Imperial Clan and Chu Feng had been formed. After hearing what Chu Feng said, they became extremely curious.

They were curious as to why Beitang Zimo insisted on creating trouble for Chu Feng.

At this moment, Beitang Zimo started to frown. He did not know how to respond to Chu Feng’s question. After all, he couldn’t possibly say before all these people that he was envious of Chu Feng.
