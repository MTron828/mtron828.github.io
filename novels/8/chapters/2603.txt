Chapter 2603 - Devised A Battle Plan

At the moment when the crowd were all puzzled by Chu Feng’s confidence, Chu Feng suddenly sat down in a cross-legged manner.

With this, the crowd grew even more confused. Chu Feng’s actions simply were not one of someone confident. Rather, he had simply not placed the dangers in his eyes at all.

However, this was strange. The crowd had all witnessed how Chu Feng had managed to defeat those slaughtering formations one after another.

The impression that they had of Chu Feng was that he was not a careless individual. Rather, he was an extremely cautious individual.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at the moment, the attack of the ferocious gaseous flames had already arrived by Chu Feng.

It was so ferocious and domineering that it seemed as if it would engulf, tear apart and destroy everything.

However, those six extremely powerful gaseous flames were unable to approach Chu Feng.

The reason for that was because they were unable to pass through that golden radiance.

They were all blocked by the golden light being emitted by the fused three treasures above Chu Feng.

“So that’s how it is. Chu Feng realized that there would be a counterattack. That’s why he fused the three treasures.”

Both Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi came to a sudden realization.

At the same time, the bystanders finally realized why Chu Feng was this confident.

It turned out that he was already prepared for this.

“This won’t do. That golden radiance doesn’t seem to be able to continue to withstand it for much longer.”

Although they understood what Chu Feng had planned, the bystanders were still extremely worried for Chu Feng.

Although the golden radiance formed by the three treasures had indeed managed to block the six gaseous flames, they were, judging from their appearance, evidently unable to continue to block the six gaseous flames for long. Chu Feng was still in great danger.

“Formation, open!!!”

Right at the moment when the crowd were all worried, Chu Feng suddenly opened his arms.

The next instant, waves of surging golden spirit power started to surge from Chu Feng’s body. They formed a spirit formation around Chu Feng.

Once this spirit formation appeared, the crowd’s eyes started to shine.

Even though this spirit formation took form immediately, anyone could tell that a lot of time had been spent in setting up this spirit formation.

This meant that Chu Feng had been setting up this spirit formation for a long time already. Merely, he was setting it up within his own body.

That was how this spirit formation managed to take form immediately after it was revealed.

Most importantly, this spirit formation possessed astonishing defensive power. It was an extremely powerful defensive formation.

Sure enough, Chu Feng already had an answer to take on that slaughtering formation. Merely, although that defensive formation was powerful, the power of those six gaseous flames could not be compared to their power from before.

“With how powerful those gaseous flames are, will Chu Feng’s spirit formation really be able to take it on?”

Even though Chu Feng’s spirit formation had astonished everyone, they did not think that Chu Feng would definitely be able to block the attack of the gaseous flames.

While the crowd was worried, Chu Feng shouted, “Formation, merge!” Then, he folded his arms and clasped his palms.

The next moment, surging spirit power was emitted from Chu Feng’s body, and started to merge with the golden radiance sprinkling down from above him.

When Chu Feng’s spirit formation merged with the three treasures’ golden radiance, its power immediately increased enormously. It was no longer comparable to before.

“Formation, rise!!!”

Chu Feng suddenly opened his clasped palms and then spread his hands wide. He began to form two different peculiar hand seals with his two hands.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Then, that grand formation started to rotate. After Chu Feng’s grand formation started to rotate, the six gaseous flames that were frantically bombarding Chu Feng’s grand defensive formation were actually knocked away.

Chu Feng’s defensive formation had actually managed to gain the upper hand in the battle against the extremely domineering gaseous flames.

“That spirit formation?”

It was only at this moment that the crowd discovered that the power from the fusion of those three treasures was only meant to be used as an assistant. Chu Feng’s spirit formation was the actual crucial aspect to breaking through that slaughtering formation.

At the moment when the crowd were all exclaiming in admiration, Chu Feng, who was sitting on the ground, suddenly stood up.

He had a sharp expression in his eyes. He shouted, “Formation, break!!!”

“Boom~~~~”

After Chu Feng’s voice sounded, his grand formation that was spinning around him started to unleash a massive offensive like a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses. It collided with the domineering gaseous flames.

The golden radiance was unstoppable. It actually managed to forcibly scatter the domineering gaseous flames.

Soon, the golden radiance covered everyone’s field of view.

When the golden radiance dispersed, the crowd were astonished to discover that Chu Feng was standing there completely unscathed. As for the six different gaseous flames, they had completely disappeared.

“Defeated! Chu Feng successfully broke through that slaughtering formation!”

The crowd burst into an uproar once again. At this moment, they were truly astonished and overjoyed.

As the saying goes, the onlooker sees more of the game. Sometimes, that saying holds very true. Although they were merely spectators, they were able to sense how frightening that slaughtering formation was.

Yet, Chu Feng was able to defeat such a frightening slaughtering formation. As such, how could they not feel overjoyed?

Most importantly, Chu Feng’s ability to defeat that slaughtering formation was truly natural and unforced. Furthermore, he had already anticipated the counterattack from the slaughtering formation. He truly could be said to have devised a battle plan. It was an extraordinary feat.

It was something that none of the people present were capable of accomplishing. As such, how could they not be astonished?

“Buzz~~~”

Right at this moment, in the desert above the Unknown Burial Ground, the spirit formation that was connected to Chu Feng and capable of showing his current situation suddenly grew dim.

At the same time, the enormous curtain of light that was being projected onto the sky started to disappear. This grand spirit formation had lost its effect.

“How could this be?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, not to mention the others, even Ying MIngchao was astonished. His previously joyful expression was immediately overshadowed with worry.

“It is not that the spirit formation has lost its effect. Rather, it seems more like some sort of power cut it off,” Zi Xunyi analyzed.

“You’re saying that someone deliberately sealed off our formation?” Ying Mingchao asked.

“That’s most likely the case,” Zi Xunyi replied.

After hearing what Zi Xunyi said, Ying Mingchao grew silent. However, the worried expression on his face grew stronger and stronger.

Having lost the effect of that spirit formation, it could be said that they had lost their means of communicating with Chu Feng.

Although Chu Feng had defeated the strongest slaughtering formation, they had no idea exactly what the situation was like inside the Unknown Burial Ground.

This was especially true because the crystal that was connected to Chu Feng had also lost its effect. With both of these methods gone, they were no longer able to determine whether or not Chu Feng was safe.

Originally, that crystal was capable of reacting to Chu Feng’s state of being. If Chu Feng was injured, it would indicate it.

However, after Chu Feng entered the healing formation, that crystal lost its effect. That was the reason why the crowd felt that Chu Feng had died that time.

However, when Chu Feng reappeared from the healing formation, Chu Feng’s shadow image once again appeared on that crystal.

However, Chu Feng’s image had been lost from the crystal again now.

After what had happened earlier, Ying Mingchao and the others were not feeling so pessimistic about Chu Feng. After all, the various things that had happened before had verified that there was some sort of formidable power in the Unknown Burial Ground capable of severing the connection between Chu Feng and that crystal.

Thus, even though Chu Feng’s image was lost from the crystal, that did not mean that Chu Feng had died.

That said, even with that being the case, Ying Mingchao and the others were still extremely worried.

To put it briefly, as long as they are not certain of Chu Feng’s safety, Ying Mingchao and the others would always be worried about Chu Feng.

......

“Strange.”

At this moment, Chu Feng, who was in the Life and Death Formation, started to frown.

“What’s wrong?” Eggy asked.

“For some unknown reason, I’ve lost connection with Senior Ying and the others,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng was able to sense that the connection had been severed. This was different from when he had entered the healing formation earlier.

At that time, he was able to hear the voices of Ying Mingchao and the others. However, he was now unable to hear any voices at all.

At this moment, the only sounds Chu Feng could hear were the sounds from the Life and Death Formation. All sounds from the outside world had been severed.

“Could it be that something has happened?” Eggy asked.

“I don’t know. However, the connection will most definitely not be lost without reason. Most likely, some sort of problem occurred with the spirit formation connecting us,” Chu Feng said.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Before Chu Feng could think much into the topic, landslide-and-tsunami-like wind noises suddenly emerged from his surroundings.

When Chu Feng looked over, he discovered that the surrounding mountain rocks were changing enormously.

The mountain rocks that were originally hard and solid had turned into white mist, and were dispersing into the sky.
