Chapter 4219 - Ruler’s Bloodline

“Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects?!”

Yuan Shu immediately started to shiver in fear upon hearing those words.

Already extremely worried for Chu Feng, Yuan Shu became even more uneasy.

As he had grown up following Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu was rather knowledgeable.

Although he had never seen the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects before, he had heard about them.

The Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects were a kind of terrifying poisonous insect. The terrifying aspect about it was that it was not an ordinary poison, or an ordinary venomous insect.

It was a sort of poisonous insect that contained spirit formations inside itself.

Those Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects were extremely rare.

Once a Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insect entered one’s body, they would utilize their spirit formations to devour the soul of their host.

The only way to drive out the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects would be to swallow the shells of the eggs they were born from.

But, those shells were as rare as the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects themselves. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Apart from taking the antidote, the only other way for one to survive them would be by having a strong enough cultivation.

But, Chu Feng’s cultivation evidently wasn’t enough to withstand the attacks of the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects.

“Yuan Shu, take care of Chu Feng. I’ll go capture that old bastard.”

After saying those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen flew off.

Whilst the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects were powerful, there was an antidote for them.

As such, the people using the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects would generally carry the antidote with them.

Because of that, Grandmaster Tang Chen wanted to retrieve an antidote for Chu Feng from Revered Master Beast Tamer.

After Grandmaster Tang Chen left, Yuan Shu began setting up a spirit formation to try to stabilize Chu Feng’s condition.

Unfortunately, although the attacks of the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects seemed to have only covered Chu Feng’s flesh, they’d already reached his soul.

The changes to his physical appearance were merely an indication of his soul being attacked.

Yuan Shu was simply helpless to do anything.

“Ji, ji, ji---”

Suddenly, the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects reacted as if they’d received some sort of terrifying shock.

They were no longer wandering through Chu Feng’s body like before.

They were currently moving through Chu Feng’s body with no aim. It seemed as if they were fleeing in disarray.

It seemed as if they were in a rush to escape from Chu Feng’s body.

But, they were unable to escape. It was as if they had been captured by something. Because of that, they started to release strange cries.

Then, under Yuan Shu’s attentive gaze, the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects inside Chu Feng’s body began to undergo another change.

Their bodies seemed to be shrinking!

“What is going on?”

Yuan Shu was completely confused by the scene before him.

He discovered that, following the strange change to the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects, the look of pain began fading from Chu Feng’s face.

Even though his painful expression had only eased slightly, his condition was indeed taking a turn for the better.

“Blast it! That old bastard had planned this ahead of time! He’s already escaped!”

“He didn’t even leave a trace of his aura behind!”

“He was determined to do harm to Chu Feng!”

Right at that moment, Grandmaster Tang Chen returned. He was fuming with rage between gritted teeth. Even killing intent was visible in his eyes.

His cultivation was that of a Martial Exalted. Although it was only rank one Martial Exalted, no peak Utmost Exalted could match him.

Normally, if he wanted to catch up to Revered Master Beast Tamer, it would not be a difficult task.

However, Revered Master Beast Tamer had made his plan ahead of time and had already escaped without a trace. Furthermore, he had used a special treasure to erase his aura, rendering Grandmaster Tang Chen unable to determine where he’d gone.

Even though Grandmaster Tang Chen possessed great ability, he had no idea where to chase without clues. Thus, he rushed back. He wanted to see if there was anything else he could do to help Chu Feng.

“Master, quickly, have a look. What’s going on with brother Chu Feng?”

Yuan Shu immediately called out for Grandmaster Tang Chen upon seeing his return.

He was unable to explain what was happening to Chu Feng. He was also unable to make sense of it.

Hearing Yuan Shu’s shout, Grandmaster Tang Chen walked over to Chu Feng.

“This... could it be?!”

Seeing the change occurring to Chu Feng, Grandmaster Tang Chen’s expression turned marvelous. He seemed to have received some sort of terrifying shock that left him feeling extremely complicated.

“Master, could it be that there’s no way to save brother Chu Feng?”

Seeing the terrified look on his master’s face, Yuan Shu, who was feeling somewhat relieved, began worrying again.

Very rarely did he see his master reveal such an expression.

Thus, he felt that it could very possibly mean that Chu Feng’s condition was hopeless.

“No, Chu Feng is fine. His body is currently devouring the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects!” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Devouring the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects?!”

“What sort of power is that? Could it be caused by a special technique he’s trained in?” Yuan Shu became even more astonished.

According to what his master had told him before, the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects were not easy to handle.

Apart from the special antidotes, they could be said to be a sort of poisonous insect without a cure.

“No, apart from the special antidote, there’s only one other method for one to survive an encounter with the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects.”

“That is, by having a sufficiently powerful cultivation. With a strong enough cultivation, one could withstand the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insect’s attempt to devour one’s soul. Once they fail their attempt, the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects will automatically leave the body.”

“But, one would need at least the body of a Martial Exalted in order to withstand the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects.”

“No matter how powerful of a technique Chu Feng might be trained in, no matter what sort of powerful treasure he might have, Chu Feng, with his current cultivation, couldn’t possibly withstand the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insect’s attempt to devour his soul,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Master, then what is happening?” Yuan Shu became even more curious after hearing his master’s explanation.

“I’ve personally witnessed the terror of the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects before.”

“Back then, I had entered a remnant with a close friend of mine, and had personally witnessed him tragically dying from being devoured by the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects. The entire time, I was helpless to do anything.”

“Because of that, the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects became something that I was unable to take my mind off of.”

“Later on, I was lucky to encounter a grandmaster world spiritist from another galaxy.”

“During our conversations, I asked him if there were methods to remove the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects besides the antidote.”

“The response that the grandmaster world spiritist gave me was...”

“Normally, apart from the antidote, the only way to stop the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects would be by having a powerful enough body.”

“Apart from that, it is practically impossible to survive an encounter with the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects. All sorts of spirit formations would be useless against them.”

“He told me that even for a world spiritist of his caliber, his world spirit techniques would not be able to remove the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Yuan Shu became even more curious after hearing that.

His master was a very proud individual. To be able to make his master humble himself to seek guidance and be addressed as a grandmaster world spiritist, Yuan Shu knew that the person that his master spoke of must possess world spirit techniques far superior to his master’s.

When even an existence of that caliber was unable to remove the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects, one could tell how powerful the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects were.

Thus, how was Chu Feng able to refine them?

“But, that grandmaster world spiritist told me later on that not everyone with a cultivation below Martial Exalted would be undoubtedly killed by the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects should they enter their body.”

“He told me he had heard of a little girl who had not even begun martial cultivation that had survived an encounter with the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“A little girl that had not even begun martial cultivation?”

“Master, who saved her?”

Yuan Shu became even more curious.

A little girl that hadn’t begun martial cultivation would have an extremely weak body.

To be able to remove the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects from a body as weak as that, how powerful of an existence must they be?

“No, she wasn’t saved by anyone. Rather, it was that little girl’s bloodline power that refined the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“What? Refined?”

“A little girl that hadn’t started martial cultivation actually refined the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects with her bloodline power?”

Yuan Shu was extremely shocked. He was terrified just hearing about it.

After all, people that hadn’t begun martial cultivation had very weak bodies. They could be said to be no different from ordinary people.

As for the Realm’s Ghost Talisman Insects, they were fatal to even peak Utmost Exalted, much less a little girl without cultivation.

“Yuan Shu, do you still remember what master told you about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?” Grandmaster Tang Chen suddenly asked.

“I do. Of course I do. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is located in the Seven Realms Galaxy. The entire vast martial cultivation world’s strongest world spiritists are all gathered there.”

“Not only are they the overlords of the Seven Realms Galaxy, but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is also the sacred temple that we world spiritists yearn to be in!”

Yearning filled Yuan Shu’s eyes when he mentioned the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

Even though he’d never been to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, had never met any world spiritist from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and only knew about it from his master, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was the place that he yearned for day and night.

It was the sacred temple in his heart.

“That little girl came from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

“Reportedly, her bloodline power was rarely seen even within the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.”

“Because of that, her bloodline was praised as a Ruler’s Bloodline!” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.
