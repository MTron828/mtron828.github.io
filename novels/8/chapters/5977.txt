Jie Tiannian revealed a look of dilemma after hearing Chu Feng’s words.

After a brief moment of silence, she replied, “I don’t want to lie to you. I’m not sure about how your mother is faring. I tried looking into it, but I couldn’t gather any news about her. Bad rumors are going around in the clan, but given how highly my father regards Ranqing, I don’t think that he’d hurt her. I'd guess that she’s doing fine, but I have no way of verifying it.”

Chu Feng sneered at Jie Tiannian’s answer, replying, “Hah. Is there anything Jie Tianran isn’t capable of?”

“Indeed. My father tends to be extreme, but I don’t think it’s entirely his choice.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Chu Feng, what do you think of my strength?”

“You are a formidable world spiritist.”

Jie Tiannian chuckled softly. “I should have long reached Heavenly Dragon, but someone advised me to reinforce my spirit power before making my breakthrough. Since then, I have made sure to reinforce my spirit power before major breakthroughs, and that has greatly benefited me. That’s why I have been suppressing my spirit power, but I can make a breakthrough if I want to.”

“Does that mean that you’re as good as a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Mm.” Jie Tiannian nodded. “The one who advised me as such is neither my parents nor the elders in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It is my younger sister, your mother. She hasn’t even reached twenty then.”

Chu Feng fell silent.

His mother, who wasn’t even twenty yet, should have been far weaker than his aunt, but she was able to offer advice to someone far stronger than her. This showed that she had a keen insight into world spiritist techniques.

At the very least, it was far superior to him back when he was still in his twenties.

Of course, Chu Feng had grown up in a Lower Realm, so the resources he could access were far inferior to those of his mother. Naturally, his growth was bound to be slower. Nevertheless, that didn’t change the fact that his mother was a formidable prodigy.

“I’m telling you this to let you know that I am a talented world spiritist too, but your mother’s talent far surpasses mine. I believe your mother is fine because I have faith in her ability to protect herself. I know that my father is not to be made light of, and he can be a frightening adversary, but your mother is no pushover either.

“Let me put it this way. If I have to turn against either my father or your mother, I’d rather turn against my father,” Jie Tiannian replied with a smile.

“Thank you for answering my question.” Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief.

Jie Tiannian’s faith in his mother’s strength gave him a lot of confidence, and he didn’t think that she had a reason to lie to him.

Besides, Chu Feng had inherited his talent from his parents. Considering how he could run circles around the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion despite only being a God-cloak World Spiritist, his mother shouldn’t be helpless against them either.

“There’s no need to stand on ceremony with me. Ask whatever is on your mind. However, you should eat as we chat, or else the food is going to turn cold,” Jie Tiannian said as she picked up a chicken thigh and placed it in Chu Feng’s bowl. “Try this. This was your mother’s favorite.”

Chu Feng tried the chicken thigh. It was delicious.

“It’s delicious. Aunt, why are they all meat dishes and no vegetables?” Chu Feng asked.

“Your mother only liked meat, but I see you like vegetables too. Let me go cook up two vegetable dishes for you,” Jie Tiannian said as she stood up to head to the kitchen.

“Aunt, there’s no need for that. There’s enough food on the table,” Chu Feng hurriedly said.

It was just a passing remark; he didn’t mean anything by it.

“It’s no trouble at all. I’ll be done in a jiffy.” Jie Tiannian had already taken out the ingredients and was starting to clean them.

“There’s no need for it, aunt.” Chu Feng stood up to grab Jie Tiannian.

The latter turned around and looked at him with a gentle smile. “Chu Feng, I’m doing this because I want to. It’s not every day I get a chance to cook for you.”

Chu Feng’s expression stiffened up.

“Sit down and eat first. I’ll be done very soon.”

Jie Tiannian first lay down her ingredients before gently but determinedly pushing Chu Feng back onto his seat. Then, she resumed her cooking.

Her words and actions struck a chord in Chu Feng’s heart, and warmth surged through his body. He knew that Jie Tiannian wasn’t being polite; she was doing this because she cared for him.

His words were just a remark made out of curiosity; he wasn’t requesting anything.

Someone as intelligent as Jie Tiannian should have known that. But Jie Tiannian discerned from those words that Chu Feng usually had his meals with vegetables, else he wouldn’t have asked such a question. That was why she insisted on cooking two more vegetable dishes for him.

She was not doing this because she felt obliged to. She just wanted to do more for Chu Feng. Only a family member would show such warmth to one another.

“Feel free to ask anything else, Chu Feng. I’ll answer all of your questions,” Jie Tiannian said.

“Aunt, were you in that realm from the very start, even when I was still communicating with the Totem Nine Daoists and we hadn't constructed our formation yet?” Chu Feng asked.

Jie Tiannian might be formidable, but Chu Feng’s formation was the Initiate Tome.

If she could breach his formation that easily, the chances were that she was present from the start and had witnessed the construction of the formation, allowing her to find the weaknesses in it.

“Yes, I was hiding in a formation. Your Initiate Tome is formidable. I would have had difficulties breaching it if I hadn’t seen your formation blueprint. Since we’re on this topic, I should tell you that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Heaven Tome doesn’t contain the Initiate Tome,” Jie Tiannian replied.
