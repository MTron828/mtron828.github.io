Chapter 3463 - Could It Be A Declaration Of War?

“No, this old man doesn’t think that would be the case.”

“While that Wuma Shengjie is extremely famous, especially in the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s eastern region, we do not know much about him. I don’t think he should be able to ascend an Apex Pillar. Instead, he should fight against the others, and use his strength to prove himself. If he is capable, he will naturally be able to partake in the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars. If his strength is lacking, it would only mean that he is inferior to the others.”

There happened to also be people that felt that Wuma Shengjie should not ascend onto an Apex Pillar. Instead, they felt that he should prove himself using his own strength.

That said, before the Starfield Master Realm changed the names on the two Apex Pillars, no one knew the who the two replacements would be.

Furthermore, if they were to change the names on the Apex Pillars, then, normally, they would be changed ahead of time. Yet, this time around, it was almost time for the beginning of the competition, but the names on the Apex Pillars were still unchanged.

Because of that, suspense toward the names that would be on the two Apex Pillars filled the crowd.

Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, the day for the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars arrived.

Yet, the names on the two Apex Pillars were still unchanged.

Exactly what was going on?

Could it be that Linghu Hongfei and Li Anzhi had changed their minds, and decided to participate in the selection?

Or could it be that they were unable to select two suitable candidates even at that moment?

Questions filled the crowd’s hearts. However, the suspense also brought them great excitement.

Suddenly, someone from the vast sea of people shouted, “Look, it’s the people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan!”

Looking toward the direction of the shout, three floating warships appeared in the sky, and approached the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.

The floating banners on the ships let the crowd know that it was the Tantai Heavenly Clan.

The people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan had arrived!!!

“Look! It’s the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan!”

Immediately after that, the people from the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan also appeared.

Although both the Tantai Heavenly Clan and the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan arrived with three floating warships, those six floating warships were simply humongous. It would not even be excessive to call them colossal. The warships were filled with the two clans’ clansmen.

One must know that, apart from the Starfield Master Realm, only the Ten Great Heavenly Clans and the Three Clans were allowed to bring their warships to this place.

It was truly a symbol of one’s identity!!!

After the arrival of the Tantai Heavenly Clan and the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan, the Moyi Heavenly Clan, Shangfang Heavenly Clan, Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, Wuma Heavenly Clan, Puyang Heavenly Clan, Tang Heavenly Clan and Li Heavenly Clan all arrived in succession.

Apart from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the remainder of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans had all reached the important guest region.

Chu Feng, Wuma Shengjie, Wuming Xingyun and the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief were all on a Tantai Heavenly Clan warship. Thus, they were not only were they able to see the vast sea of people that filled the surroundings, but they were also able to see the people from the Ten Great Heavenly Clans entering the important guest region majestically.

Likely, a scene like this would be very rare in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. After all, such a grand occasion had practically gathered powers from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

“It’s truly quite a magnificent sight,” Seeing the warships from the Ten Great Heavenly Clans orderly arranged in midair, Chu Feng was unable to help himself from gasping in admiration.

Suddenly, a Tantai Heavenly Clan’s younger generation on the warship pointed to the distance and shouted, “Look, it’s the people from the Three Clans!”

Looking in the direction he was pointing toward, there were indeed three groups of people heading towards the important guest region from three separate directions.

They were respectively the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, the Nightmare Spirit Clan, and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan.

Chu Feng was not interested in the Nightmare Spirit Clan and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan. Thus, his gaze turned to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.

“That’s the clan that Lingxi’s mother belongs to?”

“This show of strength, they are truly a major power.”

The people from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan were all humans. Both the men and women of their clan possessed rather beautiful appearances. Furthermore, one could tell right away that they were all well-trained, as their auras and imposing might all surpassed that of the Nightmare Spirit Clan and Heaven-reaching Beast Clan.

“The Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan is truly imposing,” Even Wuma Shengjie was unable to keep herself from praising them.

“Under Gu Mingyuan’s leadership, the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan seems to have become stronger and stronger. Unfortunately, Gu Mingyuan has never been interested in the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars. Thus, she didn’t come here. Otherwise, if that girl were here, this selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars would be even more interesting.”

“After all, back then, she was one of the strongest amongst the younger generations.”

Wuming Xingyun sighed regretfully. It could be seen that he was rather regretful that Gu Mingyuan didn’t show up.

“Senior, did senior Gu Mingyuan really not come?” Chu Feng asked.

“I have received reliable news that Gu Mingyuan did not come,” Wuming Xingyun said.

Hearing that, Chu Feng felt that Chu Lingxi was likely still in closed-door training, and had not come to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars. Otherwise, if she came, Gu Mingyuan would definitely be with her.

“Chu Feng, although Gu Mingyuan is very powerful, the Ten Thousand Provinces Upper Realm is actually lacking in talent. There’s no one among them worthy of you to pay attention to.”

“In fact, with Linghu Hongfei not participating, you are already unmatched in this selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars,” Wuming Xingyun said with a smile.

Wuming Xingyun did not pay any attention to the people around him when he said those words. Thus, many people on the warship managed to hear him clearly.

At that moment, many people on the warship turned their eyes to Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun. Complicated expressions appeared in their eyes.

Evidently, they did not approve of his claim.

Although some people of the younger generation had witnessed Chu Feng’s abilities and strength on the Ice Summit, not everyone knew how powerful he really was.

Furthermore, for people like Tantai Xing’er, they would not go around spreading news of how powerful he was. As such, even though things had reached this stage, many people still did not know of Chu Feng’s actual strength.

For Wuming Xingyun to speak as if he were certain that Chu Feng would be able to obtain first place in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, they would naturally not approve of it.

“In that case, apart from the people from the Three Cities, the powers from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield have all gathered here,” Wuma Shengjie exclaimed.

“Although the Three Cities are located in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they do not involve themselves with matters within it, and will not participate in anything,” Wuming Xingyun said.

“In that case, it would mean that only the Starfield Master Realm and the Linghu Heavenly Clan are still not here?” Chu Feng asked.

“The Linghu Heavenly Clan will likely soon arrive,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Why’s that?” asked Chu Feng.

“That’s because the Starfield Master Realm, as the strongest power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, will always be the last one to arrive. If the Linghu Heavenly Clan arrives after the Starfield Master Realm, it would be a sign of disrespect toward them. Thus, the Linghu Heavenly Clan will likely soon arrive. After all, judging from the timing of things, the Starfield Master Realm will also soon arrive,” explained the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“There’s such a custom?” Chu Feng gasped in surprise.

“Indeed, although it is not a written rule, that is the rule,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

At this moment, Chu Feng looked to Wuming Xingyun, and he did not deny it either.

From this, Chu Feng learned that what the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said was likely true.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
