Chapter 5901: Two Viewpoints

“Elder Sheng?”

Chu Feng was shocked, let alone those from the Three Saints Monstrous Clan. He had thought of many different possibilities, but he didn’t think the stalker would be Elder Sheng.

“Elder Sheng, don’t hurt Chu Feng! Even if Chu Xuanyuan did commit a crime, it shouldn’t implicate his son, not to mention that matter might not have anything to do with Chu Xuanyuan in the first place!” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief exclaimed anxiously.

Elder Sheng was taken aback. “Clan chief, what are you saying?”

“Elder Sheng, I know you have close ties with my father. You’re willing to do anything for him. However, Chu Xuanyuan didn’t do it on purpose. You can’t disregard the contribution he made to our clan,” the clan chief said. 

“You… Clan chief, do you think that I’m bothered about what happened back then?” Elder Sheng asked.

“Is that… not the case?” the clan chief asked.

“I get it now. Your hatred toward Chu Xuanyuan is feigned. You thought that I would blame him for failing to breach the formation and losing the sacred treasures, which resulted in your father becoming bedridden. Even though I told you I don’t blame Chu Xuanyuan, you thought that I might go after Chu Xuanyuan in view of my ties with your father.

“To stop me from making a move, you pretended to hate him so as to stay on close terms with me. The truth is that you have been trying to protect Chu Xuanyuan all along. That explains it. How could you suddenly turn against Chu Xuanyuan when the two of you were so close in the past? It turns out it was all an act!” Elder Sheng laughed.

This was the outcome he hoped to see.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was confused. “Elder Sheng, you aren’t trying to pursue what happened back then?”

“I am on close terms with your father, but I’m not an unreasonable person. Even if Chu Xuanyuan was the one who lost our sacred treasures, that was a risk we, as a clan, have chosen to take from the start. Why would I blame him?” Elder Sheng replied. 

“If it isn’t because of Chu Xuanyuan… Elder Sheng, what are you doing now?” the clan chief asked.

“Clan chief, there’s one thing I’d like to discuss with you,” Elder Sheng said.

“You can just speak your mind. There’s no need to resort to this,” the clan chief replied.

“It’s not a trifling matter. It’s about whether our clan should leave this place or not,” Elder Sheng replied. 

The clan chief finally understood Elder Sheng’s intention. His face turned grim. “Elder Sheng, the Ancient Era’s clans have left their place of dwelling. Only our Three Saints Monstrous Clan remain trapped. We enjoyed prosperity in the Ancient Era, but that was built on our ancestor’s efforts. If we want to revitalize the Three Saints Monstrous Clan, we will have to fight for resources. Otherwise, we’ll be forgotten by the world. Elder Sheng, is that what you hope for?”

Elder Sheng didn’t answer. Instead, he turned to Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you told me before we stepped into the spirit formation gate that this is a training ground for our Three Saints Monstrous Clan. Are you certain of it?” the clan chief asked.

“I am certain of it, and the truth will be out very soon,” Chu Feng replied.

Based on what he deciphered thus far, the truth would be revealed once someone accepted the sacred temple’s energy and legacy. 

Elder Sheng looked at the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and said, “Actually, there’s no need for that. We have deduced as much from our records. This isn’t our true legacy land. That’s why we have been trying to figure out what happened after the Ancient Era and why our ancestors brought us here. 

“Until we figure out the truth behind what happened back then and figure out how strong the other powers are, we’d be exposing our clansmen to danger if we remove the protective barrier. As much as the protective barrier locks us in, it also keeps outsiders at bay. I don’t think it’s wise to remove it just yet.”

The clan chief thought about those words before replying, “Elder Sheng, I understand your concerns, but we can’t lock ourselves in either. That would be equivalent to conceding defeat before the battle even started. We live in a world where the strong prey on the weak. We can’t expect others to spare us out of kindness. This protective formation might protect us for now, but it won’t protect us till the end of time. You and I know that this protective formation won’t help us if a true expert arrives. 

“Besides, our Three Saints Monstrous Clan used to be among the top ten monstrous clans in the Ancient Era. Our ancestors wouldn’t want to see our Three Saints Monstrous Clan falling into decline either, and I don’t think our people want to live like a frog in a well either. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Many of our ancestors were trapped here for their entire lives after the Ancient Era, never having the privilege to see the outside world. Can you bear to see Qiutian, Xingyu, and the others guarding this world for their entire life too? I know you’re trying to protect them here, but you should first ask them if that’s what they want first.”

Elder Sheng fell silent.

“Elder Sheng, I’m not afraid of danger. I want to go out and take a look,” Sansheng Qiutian said with determined eyes filled with desire for the outside world. 

“Elder Sheng, I concur with Qiutian.” Sansheng Xingyu looked at Elder Sheng with the same eyes as Sansheng Qiutian.

A belief that Elder Sheng had held on to for the longest time shattered, and his mind went blank. He was doing this with the clansmen’s safety in mind, but there was no point doing it if that was not what they wanted. 

“Ey!” Elder Sheng suddenly sighed.

The oppressive might enveloping Chu Feng and the others dissipated. 

“I apologize for my insubordination. Clan chief, please punish me,” Elder Sheng said as he dropped to his knees.

However, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief stepped forward to support him, saying, “Elder Sheng, you watched me grow up. You’re an elder to me, not a subordinate. We have our differences, but I know you have our clan’s welfare at heart. I’ll seek our clansmen’s opinion before making a move. I won’t destroy the formation if the majority decides to stay here.”

“It looks like I was overthinking it.” Elder Sheng sighed.
