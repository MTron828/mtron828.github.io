Chapter 5043: Hope Amidst Despair

“Even the Pill Dao Immortal Sect won’t be able to curb him? I find that hard to believe.”

The first reaction of Shengguang Baimei, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others was disbelief.

That was only to be expected. Even if Sima Xiangtu succeeded and advanced his cultivation considerably, he should only reach early Half-God level at the very most.

In contrast, how powerful is the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?

Putting all things aside, just those who had appeared before them thus far were already much stronger than just rank one Half-God level.

It was hard to imagine that Sima Xiangtu would reach a level that was beyond the Pill Dao Immortal Sect’s control.

“I don’t think that my master would say such words carelessly. He must have his reasons for coming to this conclusion. It looks like we’ll have to stop Sima Xiangtu, or else it’ll lead to a great deal of trouble in the future.”

In contrast, Chu Feng believed in the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s words.

“Junior Chu Feng, let’s ask my master for help,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

She wanted to bring the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster into this.

“While the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect usually steers clear of secular affairs, Lord Sectmaster does have eyes all around. It’s likely that she’s already aware of Sima Xiangtu’s schemes. She would have already interfered if she wanted to.”

Chu Feng’s words made it clear that it was unlikely that they could rely on the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

“It looks like we can only engage Lord Holy Monarch’s help. Lord Baimei, what do you think?” Daoist Niantian said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Daoist Niantian was only an honorary elder, so the one who had the greatest say on this matter was still Shengguang Baimei.

“Sima Xiangtu is a man of wild ambitions, not to mention that he harbors hostility toward our Holy Light Galaxy. We shouldn’t interrupt Lord Holy Monarch from his closed-door training unless we’re faced with desperate circumstances, but it looks like it’s time to do it,” Shengguang Baimei said.

He was loyal to both the Holy Valley and the Holy Monarch. If there was another choice, he would have never interrupted the Holy Monarch from his closed-door training. The fact that he was saying such words meant that he thought that the situation was severe enough to warrant such actions.

It was one thing if this was just a matter of the Nine Souls Galaxy, but Sima Xiangtu’s malicious intention wasn’t just limited to the NIne Souls Galaxy. Even if the Holy Light Galaxy chose to turn a blind eye to it now, it was only a matter of time before Sima Xiangtu came knocking on their door.

“Speaking of which, elder, do you have any way of opening this Cosmos Sack?” Chu Feng suddenly took out a Cosmos Sack and asked.

The eyes of Daoist Niantian, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others lit up upon seeing the Cosmos Sack. They sensed something unusual from it.

“This is a Cosmos Sack of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Is it from that young master?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“Yes, it belongs to Jiang Kongping,” Chu Feng replied.

He had snatched this Cosmos Sack over from Jiang Kongping, but he wasn’t able to open it due to a special seal being placed on top of it. He had tried getting Jiang Kongping to open it himself, but that fellow actually said that he didn’t know how to open it.

Needless to say, Chu Feng wouldn’t believe that nonsense. He gave Jiang Kongping a beating right afterward, but the latter’s lips were tightly sealed despite all of his screamings.

In the end, he could only let things rest.

“What a formidable formation!”

After examining the Cosmos Sack, the Godwish Grandmother, Daoist Niantian, and the others frowned.

“Elder, are you unable to open it?” Chu Feng asked.

“This formation looks almost impossible to decipher. I don’t think that the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect could have set up such a powerful formation by himself. In fact, I’m guessing that it might have been from one of the ancestors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

“I’m afraid that I’m helpless before this,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

“My apologies, young friend Chu Feng. I’m also unable to help you on this,” Daoist Niantian said.

The Lady of Dao Sea also shook her head.

“It looks like the Pill Dao immortal Sect does possess quite some means.”

Left with no choice, Chu Feng could only stow the Cosmos Sack away for the time being.

A worried look appeared on his face. It was not because he was unable to open the Cosmos Sack but because he had no idea how to deal with Sima Xiangtu. All of a sudden, a thought came to his mind.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, I’ve actually met your father before,” Chu Feng said.

“How is my father doing?” Princess Xiaoxiao asked anxiously.

“You need not worry. He’s not in danger for the time being. However, your father told me that he knows of a person who could save the Nine Souls Galaxy, just that he fainted before he could finish his words. I’d like to ask you if you have any idea whom he might be talking about,” Chu Feng asked.

“I-I’m afraid I’ve never heard anything of that sort from my father.”

Princess Xiaoxiao shook her head.

“You don’t know?”

While Chu Feng had known that there was a chance that Princess Xiaoxiao might not know about it, he was still disappointed to hear her answer. After all, that was the greatest clue out of the quandary they were in right now.

“A person who could save the Nine Souls Galaxy… Do we have a person like that?”

The Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea fell into deep thoughts after hearing those words. They wanted to help Chu Feng to figure it out. However, they couldn’t think of anyone who fitted the profile.

Such a person didn’t exist in their mind.

“Now that I think about it, there was an elder who saved me from the prison that day. It was that elder who told me where Jiang Kongping was. It’s just that I don’t know whether that elder is the person whom the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief was talking about,” Chu Feng said.

“Junior Chu Feng, what does the elder you have met look like?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

Chu Feng quickly explained the physical traits of that elder to the Godwish Grandmother.

“This… is a little hard to guess.”

The Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea soon shook their heads, expressing that they couldn’t think of anyone like that.

That was only to be expected. Chu Feng hadn’t really given them much to work with.

“I have a suggestion. When we leave this teleportation formation, Elder Baimei and Elder Niantian should return to the Holy Light Galaxy first and see if we can invite the Holy Valley’s Holy Monarch here to resolve this matter. Meanwhile, I’d like to return to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan,” Chu Feng said.

“Junior Chu Feng, you’re hoping to find the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief and ask him who that person is?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“Young hero Chu Feng, you mustn’t do that! The Nine Souls Sacred Clan is bound to be tightly guarded after all that has happened. You shouldn’t take such a risk! You should follow us back to the Holy Valley instead,” Shengguang Baimei persuaded.

“Elder Baimei, I’m not doubting the Holy Valley’s capability, but are you certain that the Holy Monarch would interfere in this matter?” Chu Feng asked.

“This…”

Shengguang Baimei couldn’t answer that question since he couldn’t speak in the Holy Monarch’s stead.

“Since I was able to successfully infiltrate the prison once, I should be able to do it a second time. Trust me, I’ll be able to return safe and sound,” Chu Feng said.

“Junior Chu Feng, we’ll accompany you,” the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea said.

They offered to head there with him instead of persuading Chu Feng not to go because they knew that the Nine Souls Galaxy was in a desperate position. Chu Feng’s plan did offer them a ray of hope, such that they had to attempt it even if it came with huge risks.

Above that, they had promised the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster that they would protect Chu Feng.

“I’m coming along too,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.

Chu Feng didn’t turn them down because he knew that it would be hard to persuade them otherwise. Besides, the chances of success would be much higher with the Godwish Grandmother’s help.

Soon, they exited the teleportation formation and split into two teams.

Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian would be returning to the Holy Valley to engage the Holy Monarch’s help. Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the others prepared to return to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to find out who that person who could save the Nine Souls Galaxy was.

Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian first took their leave whereas Chu Feng and the others first planned out their route. After they were done with their planning, they headed toward the ancient teleportation formation, only to be stopped by a sudden voice behind them.

“You’re thinking of returning to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan? Don’t you know how dangerous that place is?”

Chu Feng and the others quickly turned their heads around upon hearing that voice.

“Elder, it’s you!” Chu Feng exclaimed in delight.
