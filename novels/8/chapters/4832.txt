Chapter 4832: Mysterious Elder

The sectmaster stared at Chu Feng with forceful eyes. Zi Ling looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with worry. Even Duan Liufeng was staring at him with complicated eyes. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Such a change made Chu Feng realize that something grave must have occurred.

“Something else? Sectmaster, may I know what you’re referring to?” Chu Feng asked.

“Was it really Duan Liufeng who brought you into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?” the sectmaster asked.

“I...”

Chu Feng couldn’t answer that question. He turned to look at Duan Liufeng, only to see the latter staring at him with even more complicated eyes. There was a hint of hesitation, internal conflict, doubt, and guilt.

“Chu Feng, could it be that we’ve been exposed?” Yu Sha reminded him.

Even without Yu Sha’s reminder, Chu Feng had already pretty much figured out what was going on. He had entered the sect through the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation.

As his cultivation had regressed due to the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor, that mysterious existence told him that no one would believe that he had entered the sect through clearing the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation, and he might even be expelled upon the grounds of lying.

The mysterious existence was unwilling to make an appearance and explain on Chu Feng’s behalf, so he decided to alter an elder’s memories to make the elder believe that he was the one who brought Chu Feng into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

Chu Feng was determined to save Zi Ling, and the mysterious existence was not someone he could negotiate with, so he had no choice but to agree to the course of action.

And the elder who had his memories altered was none other than Duan Liufeng.

Chu Feng felt guilt-ridden. He knew that the sectmaster wouldn’t ask this question for no reason, so it was likely that either she or Duan Liufeng had noticed something.

Given that, he figured that it was time to be out with the truth.

“Lord Sectmaster, I think that the suppression from the formation and the injuries I’ve suffered might have sent my memories in disarray. It could be possible that I was the one who brought Chu Feng in too,” Duan Liufeng said.

“Duan Liufeng, I know deep well your relationship with Chu Feng, so you need not speak anymore. I want Chu Feng to tell me the truth himself,” the sectmaster said.

“Lord Sectmaster, I was indeed not brought into this sect by Elder Duan,” Chu Feng said.

Duan Liufeng’s eyes turned even more complicated upon hearing those words.

Chu Feng began revealing everything that had happened on his own accord.

“... and that’s all that happened.

“I apologize, Brother Duan. It wasn’t my intention to make use of you. I’m also sorry to Lord Sectmaster. It wasn’t my intention to deceive you either,” Chu Feng bowed to both of them and apologized.

“To think that I was forced with artificial memories... Brother Chu, who was the elder in the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation?” Duan Liufeng asked curiously.

Duan Liufeng knew that there were many experts who were stronger than him out there in the world, but he didn’t consider himself to be a weakling either.

Yet, he still got memories forced on him without him knowing. To make things worse, he never doubted a thing at all.

It was clear that the mysterious existence was someone who wielded unfathomable powers.

“Brother Duan, I never got to meet with that elder. I initially thought that he was an elder of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but it looks like things aren’t as simple as that,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, is what you said true? Is there really such a mysterious individual in the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation? On top of that, are you certain that you have no other interaction with that mysterious individual?” the sectmaster asked.

“You need not question him any further. I believe him. After all, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect does have a lot of powerful figures whom we are unqualified to know about,” another voice suddenly sounded beside Zi Ling.

There was a slight warping of space, and a person suddenly materialized beside Zi Ling.

It was no other than the white skirt woman whom they had met on the True Essence Mountain when Zi Ling’s soul was at threat of dissipation.

“Could it be that... you’re the elder we’re looking for?” Chu Feng asked.

From the moment the white skirt woman took out a pill to treat both his and Zi Ling’s conditions, he had already realized that this woman was no ordinary person.

However, it looked like there was more to it than he had imagined.

“Yes, I’m indeed the person you’re looking for. I was also the one who removed the memories enforced on Duan Liufeng. In truth, I’ve already learned about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s plight from the moment Duan Liufeng first got trapped. I secretly returned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect with your sectmaster the first time she came here and saw the calamity.

“I knew right away that the calamity was different from what had happened in previous years. It was a calamity triggered by the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation. Based on my investigation, you’re the most likely suspect.

“Thus, after Duan Liufeng got to the foot of the mountain, I used my means to cleanse Duan Liufeng’s memories, and it turned out that his memories had indeed been tampered with. You... are the disciple who has entered the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect through the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation, as well as the one responsible for triggering the calamity!” the white skirt woman said.

“The great calamity really has something to do with me?”

Chu Feng had noticed the clues that the calamity might have been related to him due to several odd coincidences, such as the calamity starting on the same day he cleared the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation. He had asked a few people about it, but all of them denied the possibility that the calamity might have something to do with the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation.

Besides, Chu Feng didn’t think that he had the means to break that terrifying calamity either, so he gradually expelled such thoughts from his mind.

“Chu Feng, you mentioned that the mysterious individual has given you the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor, and you managed to make a breakthrough earlier at the mountain peak. Does this mean that you’ve managed to fully decipher the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor?” the white skirt woman asked.

“Elder, I’ve indeed managed to fully decipher the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor.”

As Chu Feng said those words, he retrieved the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor from his body to show it to them.

“So this is the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor. It’s indeed a formidable treasure.”

Zi Ling, Duan Liufeng, and the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple were all impressed by the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor. Even the sectmaster nodded in approval too.

“It’s truly a formidable treasure. I’ve heard about it, but nothing beats seeing it in the flesh,” the white skirt woman remarked.

She turned to the sectmaster and said, “Since the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor has been fully deciphered, the calamity should fully descend upon the sect very soon. You need to return as soon as possible.”

“Elder, does that calamity have something to do with the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor?” Chu Feng asked.

“It does, but the greatest link is still to you. Chu Feng, you may keep the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor. It’s something you deserve,” the white skirt woman said.

“Elder, what... do I have to do?” Chu Feng asked.

He had been feeling guilty ever since he learned that he was the one who caused the calamity, and his heart wouldn’t be able to rest at ease if the entire Hidden Dragon Martial Sect were to suffer because of him.

“You’re the only one who can break the calamity. As for how to do it, I have already relayed the method to your sectmaster. You should quickly return.”

After finishing her words, the white skirt woman began returning to the True Essence Mountain.

“Elder, aren’t you going to return with us?” the sectmaster asked.

Her tone was oddly gentle, almost like a plea.

“I believe that you’ll be able to resolve this matter well. If not, you should just return the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to the hands of those powerful beings. It would mean that we’re unqualified to take care of the sect,” the white skirt woman said before vanishing from sight.

She seemed to have left, but the truth was that she had only risen above the sky, where the old man who was known as True Essence Exalted was standing.

No one could see him from there, making him almost like a lofty god gazing down on the world.

However, as soon as the white skirt woman came close, True Essence exalted quickly put on a fawning smile.

“I was still wondering which lad had the power to fully absorb my cauldron’s energy, but it turns out to be my milord’s junior! Milord, could it be that you used to be from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?” True Essence Exalted asked.

“You need not probe too deep into my affairs. I just wish to cultivate here in peace. From now on, don’t allow anyone to scale the mountain. If I were to see anyone else in this vicinity, I’ll have you scram as well,” the white skirt woman said.

“I understand,” True Essence Exalted lowered his back deeply and replied.

The white skirt woman had already left, but True Essence Exalted still kept his back bent for a long while before finally rising back up.

He was already sweating profusely by then, and his eyes rippled with deference.
