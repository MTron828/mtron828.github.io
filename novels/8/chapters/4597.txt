Chapter 4597: I’m From Ancestral Martial Galaxy

“Big brother Chu Feng, what are you in a daze for? It can’t be that you are intimidated by them too?” Song Yun suddenly spoke up, interrupting Chu Feng’s train of thoughts.

“Lass, what are you talking about?”

Chu Feng turned to look at Song Yun, only to be a little surprised.

Along the way, Song Yun had been wearing a cloak all this while to conceal her face. However, her face had clearly changed a little, transforming from a demure young lady into an acne-filled face of a youth.

“Only men are allowed to participate in the matchmaking convention, so it goes without saying that I need to disguise myself a bit in order to enter,” Song Yun told him through voice transmission.

“Lass, you’re planning on entering too?”

Chu Feng was surprised.

“Of course! If I don’t enter, who is going to lead you to the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl?” Song Yun replied.

“But those are the underlings of the Wretched Black Demon. Are you certain that you’ll be able to fool them?”

Chu Feng felt worried about Song Yun. It was apparent that the world spiritists guarding the spirit formation gate were no ordinary individuals; they were the underlings of a powerful expert possessing powers on par with the Sagacious Grandmaster!

Even Chu Feng wasn’t confident of deceiving them with his world spiritist techniques, let alone Song Yun!

“Big brother Chu Feng, you don’t need to worry. I have my own ways.”

Song Yun blinked her twinkling eyes at Chu Feng.

Since she had already said so, Chu Feng could only go along with her.

Even though there were already two other people who had entered the spirit formation gate ahead of them, Chu Feng and Song Yun still caught the attention of the crowd while they were walking ahead.

“Report your background!”

The world spiritists guarding the spirit formation gate questioned.

All of the world spiritists were standing around, with the exception of an old man with a white beard. This old man was seated before a wooden table, and he was recording down the names of those who entered the spirit formation gate.

“I am from the Nine Souls Galaxy, and my name is Song Yun,” Song Yun said with a bow.

It was just that her voice had already turned into that of a male youth.

The white-bearded old man didn’t even raise his head or say anything. He simply waved his hand, and a golden orb flew right toward Song Yun.

Song Yun caught the orb and infused her spirit power into it, causing it to glow brilliantly.

That was the test to prove that one was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, and Song Yun successfully cleared it.

Seeing this, the white-bearded old man quickly jotted down Sogn Yun’s name on the paper before ushering her in, “You may enter.”

Without any hesitation, Song Yun walked into the spirit formation gate.

Chu Feng, however, looked at Song Yun’s disappearing silhouette within the spirit formation gate with a deep look in his eyes. He could tell that Song Yun’s spirit power had come from her body, and it felt extremely pure. It didn’t look like she was artificially raising her power using a treasure.

If she wasn’t relying on a treasure to clear the test, could it mean that she was a true Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist too?

But how old was she? She was only in her teens!

Chu Feng would have been thankful if he could even reach Gold-cloak back in his teens, let alone Dragon Mark Saint-cloak! If Song Yun had really managed to reach that level without relying on any treasures, her talents would have really reached a frightening level.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng had a feeling that that lass had an even more complicated background than he did.

“What are you dazing out here for? Are you intending on entering or not?”

A bellow suddenly sounded while Chu Feng was deep in thought. It was from the white-bearded old man in charge of recording down the names.

“I am Chu Feng, from... Ancestral Martial Galaxy.”

Chu Feng pondered for a while before choosing to report Ancestral Martial Galaxy instead of Holy Light Galaxy, In his view, the Holy Light Galaxy wasn’t worthy of being an overlord. Chu Feng wasn’t embarrassed by his galaxy, but he was embarrassed of the Holy Light Clan.

“What? Ancestral Martial Galaxy?”

Those words brought about a huge commotion amidst the crowd. The eyes that were focused on Chu Feng suddenly began gleaming.

“Hahaha!”

But at the next instant, jarring laughter sounded from all around.

“Isn’t the Ancestral Martial Galaxy the Holy Light Galaxy? How laughable! Weaklings from the Holy Light Galaxy actually dreams of becoming the granddaughter-in-law of Lord Black Demon! A toad lusting for the flesh of a swan! Do you have no sense of shame?”

All sorts of criticisms sounded across the air.

These people only dared to talk about the three prodigies of the Gongsun Clan and Yin Tianchou only after they had left the area, but they had no qualms with shaming Chu Feng publicly.

This was the disdain that those of the Nine Souls Galaxy carried toward the Holy Light Galaxy. They viewed the latter to be lower beings, a congregation of weaklings!

“You are indeed a group of toads. It’s no wonder that you dare not even enter the spirit formation gate.”

It was from Chu Feng.

Those words had everyone present freezing in place. They never thought that someone from the lower Holy Light Galaxy would actually dare to insult them.

“You bastard! A useless twat like you dares to insult us? Try saying that again!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Do you know who I am? You think that I dare not take your dog life?”

“You ignorant fool! All it takes is a word for me to obliterate your whole clan!”

After a moment of shocked silence, all sorts of criticisms were hurled in Chu Feng’s direction.

“You wish to give it a try?” Chu Feng replied as his eyes narrowed in coldness.

“Silence!”

It was then that the white-bearded old man suddenly released a furious roar that had everyone shutting their mouths right away. Following that, he turned his gaze to Chu Feng.

He impassively glanced at the glowing stone in Chu Feng’s hand before advising, “You should think twice about this. This is the Nine Souls Galaxy you’re in, not your Holy Light Galaxy. The dangers you’ll face here can take your life away.”

Even he, an older world spiritist, was looking down on Chu Feng too.

“Heh...”

Chu Feng smiled lightly as he passed the stone back to the white-bearded old man. Following that, he began walking toward the spirit formation gate. His action made it clear that he was going to challenge the Incubation Forest.

“Another fool who doesn’t fear death.”

The white-bearded old man muttered to himself as he began jotting down Chu Feng’s name on the paper.

While he looked down on Chu Feng, he still carried out his responsibilities without fail. No matter where the candidate was from, as long as he proved himself qualified and dared to enter, his name would have to be jotted down on the paper.

“Elder, I am from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, not the Holy Light Galaxy.”

Chu Feng’s voice suddenly sounded at this moment. He was reminding the white-bearded old man to jot down his origins according to what he had just said.

“Got it. You sure are noisy.”

Despite saying so, the white-bearded old man still wrote down ‘Holy Light Galaxy, Chu Feng’ with a quick flick of his wrist.

He was disregarding Chu Feng blatantly.

However, Chu Feng didn’t lose his temper due to this. He had been treated in this manner far too often to know that it was useless to lose his temper. If he wanted to earn the respect of others, what he had to depend on wasn’t his mouth but his strength. He was still weak at the moment, so he could only tolerate the disdain and contempt of others.

To speak up without the strength to back it up wasn’t spunk; it was a failure to recognize one’s own place.

However, Chu Feng didn’t just obediently enter the spirit formation gate right away. Instead, he stopped right before the entrance and turned around to face the crowd.

“You bunch of trash, come in if you dare. I would love to see just how dangerous your Nine Souls Galaxy is. I, your grandfather, will be waiting for all of you inside!”

After saying those words, Chu Feng left them with a cold sneer before walking into the spirit formation gate.

Meanwhile, all of the juniors outside exploded in anger!!!
