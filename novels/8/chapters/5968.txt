Chapter 5969: Meeting the Totem Nine Daoists

As soon as the door opened, tremendous pressure descended from the sky.

The square beneath his feet and the door before him dissipated as spirit power. The ocean water beneath began to rage.

Chu Feng couldn't fly due to the pressure from the sky, so he plummeted into the water.

A terrifying suction force inside the ocean water relentlessly washed him all over the place like a rag cloth. At the same time, the water contained a great amount of spirit power that surged into his body, inflicting excruciating pain on him.

His senses and abilities were severely limited.

“Did I fail? No, that’s impossible.”

Chu Feng was confident in his formation deciphering sequence, which was why he unhesitatingly opened the door in the first place. He forced himself to calm down and allowed the currents to wash him wherever they wanted to bring him.

He knew he couldn’t change the situation anymore. It was better to go with the flow and await the answer.

By the time the currents stopped, Chu Feng was already deep underwater. The suction force had vanished, but the pressure on him persisted. His means remained sealed.

Moving around was difficult for Chu Feng, let alone returning to the surface. At the same time, the excruciating pain ravaging his body persisted too. It wouldn’t be good if this situation continued.

Chu Feng realized things weren’t as simple as he thought. The remnant wouldn’t be cleared just by him opening the door. In truth, there was one last trial awaiting him.

Thus, he endured the pain and assessed his surroundings. He couldn’t use his psyche here due to the restrictions, so he could only rely on his own eyes.

“That is...” Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed in shock. He saw a familiar figure floating not far away. “Daoist Ninth Dragon?”

It was none other than the Totem Nine Daoists’ Daoist Ninth Dragon.

However, Daoist Ninth Dragon was completely knocked out. His aura was so weak that he could lose his life at any moment.

“Is it a hallucination?” Chu Feng wondered if he had entered an illusory formation, as it seemed too much of a coincidence for him to meet Daoist Ninth Dragon here.

This didn’t seem like a place Daoist Ninth Dragon would come to.

But when Chu Feng suppressed his pain and took another look, he quickly became certain this wasn’t an illusory formation. Thus, he quickly made his way to Daoist Ninth Dragon.

The latter wasn’t exactly far away—it was a distance he could have instantaneously covered under normal circumstances—but due to the tremendous pressure, it took him a while before he reached Daoist Ninth Dragon.

Similarly, he could only inspect Daoist Ninth Dragon’s condition after getting closer due to the restrictions.

Chu Feng quickly took out a couple of pills and fed them to Daoist Ninth Dragon. Then, he used his spirit power to stabilize the latter’s condition.

But at the same time, he noticed two other familiar figures floating not far away—they were Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Seventh Dragon. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Did they come here after we bade farewell back then?”

Chu Feng still remembered the day he parted ways with Daoist Sixth Dragon, Daoist Seventh Dragon, Daoist Eighth Dragon, and Daoist Ninth Dragon. They were planning to travel together, but the four daoists met with an abrupt situation and had to leave in a hurry.

The four of them had spoken like they were parting ways for good as if they were going to do something dangerous.

Chu Feng first stabilized Daoist Ninth Dragon’s condition before doing the same for Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Seventh Dragon.

The latter two were in better shape than Daoist Ninth Dragon, but they were unlikely to regain consciousness in the short run. However, if the three of them were here, the chances were likely that Daoist Sixth Dragon was here too.

Thus, Chu Feng began looking around.

The restrictions here greatly hindered his psyche, so he could only search with his naked eyes, but his range of sight was still severely limited. Simply put, his current means were at the level of a mortal.

While searching for Daoist Sixth Dragon, Chu Feng also wondered about how he could escape from this place.

Perhaps it was luck, but Chu Feng soon found Daoist Sixth Dragon.

There was another white-haired old man with him, presumably one of the Totem Nine Daoists and likely to be even stronger than Daoist Sixth Dragon. Both were unconscious, though the white-haired old man was in a better condition.

Chu Feng proceeded to treat the two of them.

Soon, the old man woke up.

“C-Chu Feng?” The old man’s eyes lit up. He was initially confused, but after looking around, he became certain that this wasn’t an illusion. Thus, he looked at Chu Feng and asked, “Y-you are Chu Feng, right?”

“Elder, I am Chu Feng. How should I address you?” Chu Feng asked.

“You may call me Daoist Fifth Dragon.”

After a quick conversation, Chu Feng understood what was going on.

Daoist Fifth Dragon had been in closed-door cultivation, so he didn’t know about Chu Feng’s affairs. What he knew about Chu Feng came from Daoist Sixth Dragon and the others, who claimed that Chu Feng was a highly talented junior who would become famous in the world of cultivation.

They met up because they received messages from First Dragon, Second Dragon, Third Dragon, and Fourth Dragon, but it wasn’t a call for help but a warning for them to never come here.

It turned out that the Totem Nine Daoists came to obtain Jie Tianran’s formation deciphering sequence by coincidence. After some preparations, the four daoists decided to give it a try, only to end up trapped.

But before entering the remnant, they left a formation outside. If they didn’t return to dispel the formation within a set time, the formation would send a message to inform their remaining brothers that they had met with a mishap in the remnant.

This message served as a reminder for them to be careful in the future.

As famous as the Totem Nine Daoists were, the more powerful ones were Daoist First Dragon, Daoist Second Dragon, Daoist Third Dragon, and Daoist Fourth Dragon. The former two had even reached pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist, making them a force to be reckoned with.

That was also why the Totem Nine Daoists tended to act arrogantly, which led to them making many enemies.

If they lost the backing of Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon, they would have to maintain a low profile lest their enemies go after them.

Daoist First Dragon had left that formation out of concern for his weaker brothers, but the Totem Nine Daoists were a loyal bunch despite the massive gap in their strength.

Daoist Sixth Dragon and the others rushed to the remnant to rescue them. Even Daoist Fifth Dragon came out of his closed-door training to lend a helping hand.

It was fortunate the Daoist Fifth Dragon knew Jie Tianran’s formation deciphering sequence too.

Despite their weaker spirit power, which led to them taking more time to decipher the formations, they still managed to reach this point. Yet, they got stuck here instead of saving their four older brothers.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you... aren’t affected by this place?” Daoist Fifth Dragon asked.

“I am affected too, but I can withstand it,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I’m begging you. Please find my four older brothers. They should be trapped here too. I know it’s inappropriate for me to make such a request when it’s our first time meeting, especially in a dangerous place like this, but I have no other choice. I’ll do anything as long as you save my four older brothers!”

Daoist Fifth Dragon was not young, but he spoke with an earnest tone and reddened eyes.

He truly cared for his four older brothers.
