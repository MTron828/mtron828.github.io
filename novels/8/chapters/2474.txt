Chapter 2474 - Chu Feng’s Influence

“What sort of ability does this Chu Luxuan possess?” Chu Feng asked.

“Very few people know what cultivation that Chu Luxuan possesses. However, he is like you, a member of the younger generation.”

“Furthermore, as he possesses the reputation of being a genius in the Chu Heavenly Clan, he was able to move about completely unhindered upon arriving in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”

“After arriving in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he managed to, in less than a single year, gather countless powers to submit to him.”

“Among them is the Ying Heavenly Clan and the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, the World Spiritist Saintess,” Liu Xiaoli said.

“My enemies have all submitted to him. It would appear that he plans to take care of me,” Chu Feng said with a smile. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You’ve killed his biological older brother. Naturally, he will want to take care of you. Although it has been said that you died two years ago, he has still continued to search for your whereabouts the entire time. His demand is to find you if you’re alive, and find your corpse if you’re dead.”

“If he were to know that you’re still alive, he would definitely attack you. Chu Feng, you must definitely be careful; you must not let him find you,” Liu Xiaoli said to Chu Feng with great concern.

Although Liu Xiaoli did not know exactly how powerful Chu Luxuan was, she was still extremely worried for Chu Feng. After all, Chu Luxuan was a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan, a genius from the Upper Realms. One could imagine how frightening he must be just by thinking about it.

“Since all of my enemies have become his subordinates, even if he does not try to find me, I would have gone to find him.”

“There are certain debts that must be settled properly,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“......”

Upon hearing what Chu Feng said, Liu Xiaoli and the others revealed dumbfounded expressions. They grew quiet.

They were truly unable to understand what Chu Feng was thinking. After all, that Chu Luxuan possessed a robust background. They felt that it was clearly not a sensible act to confront him head-on.

However, upon thinking about it further, they started to feel at ease. They recalled that they had actually never been able to understand Chu Feng, that Chu Feng had always been like this, always been someone who would continue in his own way without any fear.

Perhaps it might be precisely because Chu Feng was different like this that he had managed to achieve what he had.

Furthermore, the current Chu Feng was incomparable to before. He possessed the cultivation of a rank seven martial Ancestor, and was also a possessor of a Heavenly Bloodline. He was already an extremely frightening character.

Moreover, Chu Feng had nearly extinguished the Kong Heavenly Clan two years ago. Although they had not witnessed that scene, they still felt their blood run cold just by imagining it.

Upon thinking of all that, they instead felt that their worries were unnecessary.

Suddenly, Liu Xiaoli’s expression turned very serious. She said to Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, please accept my respect.”

After she finished saying those words, a ‘putt’ was heard, and Liu Xiaoli kneeled before Chu Feng.

It was not only Liu Xiaoli. Everyone from the Red Butterfly Society kneeled before Chu Feng.

“What are you all doing?” Chu Feng revealed a surprised expression.

“If it wasn’t for the sake of avenging my master, you would not have offended the Ying Heavenly Clan, killed Chu Luyang and made all these enemies.”

“I fear that our Red Butterfly Society is likely unable to repay what we owe. Thus, the only thing we can do is be grateful toward you,” Liu Xiaoli said.

“So it’s actually regarding that,” After finding out why Liu Xiaoli and the others reacted in such a manner, Chu Feng laughed.

As he spoke, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and a gentle power enveloped Liu Xiaoli and the others, bringing them back to their feet.

“Your master showed kindness toward me. His kindness is something that I will never forget. With him being killed by another, there was no reason for me to remain indifferent. Thus, I have done everything not only for you all, but also for myself. You do not need to feel that you owe me for this. After all, you didn’t owe me anything to begin with.”

“That said, why did you all come here and change your Red Butterfly Society’s name?” Chu Feng asked.

“After you killed Chu Luyang, everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan that existed in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm felt bitter hatred toward you.”

“However, they were unable to do anything to you. As such, they ended up creating troubles for us. Forced into a corner, we had no choice but to leave and conceal our identities.”

“This is especially true after that Chu Luxuan appeared in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. We had no choice but to continue migrating. If we were to be discovered by him, we would undoubtedly be killed,” Liu Xiaoli said.

“I will settle the matter regarding that Chu Luxuan as soon as possible,” Chu Feng realized that if Chu Luxuan was not settled, all those related to him in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would likely be implicated by him.

Suddenly, Chu Feng asked with a worried expression, “Oh, that’s right, how are the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall right now?”

The reason for that was because everyone knew that the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall were related to him.

After all, when the Ying Heavenly Clan had wanted to kill Chu Feng, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall had publicly announced that they would protect him.

As such, Chu Feng was worried about the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.

“You don’t have to worry about the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall. Although the Kong Heavenly Clan has become your bitter enemy, their reputation has also suffered catastrophically.”

“While at the heart of the struggle, they will not dare to do anything to the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall. Thus, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall have been unscathed the entire time.”

“Not only were they not implicated by you, they have instead received benefits due to you. Right now, many idle experts of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm have joined the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall to become their guest elders.”

“The Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall have also become powers, apart from the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple and the Immortal Sword School, that the people of the younger generation yearn to join the most.”

“During the past two years, whenever the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall took in new disciples, young talents from all over the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will choose to join them.”

“Although the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall are not the strongest among the tier two powers, their popularity is something that no other tier two power could compare to.”

“Right now, it could be said that the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall are the most mighty powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm apart from the four tier one powers.”

“As for all this, it is all because of you.”

When Liu Xiaoli spoke, she had a very proud expression. After all, the extraordinary individual that she was speaking of was her close friend.

“Aiyoh, Chu Feng, not bad, eh? Never would I have expected that your status would reach so high in the two years you’ve disappeared from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Her Lady Queen teased.

However, the tone that Her Lady Queen spoke with was one of someone feeling joy for Chu Feng.

While Chu Feng had a lot of enemies now, the fact that he possessed such great power and influence meant that the majority of the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm sided with him. To Chu Feng, this would be a very advantageous thing.

“While the Kong Heavenly Clan did not attack them, what about that Chu Luxuan?” Chu Feng asked.

Actually, Chu Feng had already guessed that the Kong Heavenly Clan would not attack the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.

After all, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s dark plot of killing Chu Feng had already caused them to lose all respect among the crowd. If they were to attack the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, they would truly become utterly notorious.

However, it was different for Chu Luxuan. He was not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, nor did he wish to establish himself in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Chu Feng felt that Chu Luxuan had not mainly come to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to avenge his older brother. Likely, his main purpose in coming must be to carry out some sort of mission.

Thus, if he wanted to deal with Chu Feng, he would simply not take into consideration whether or not he would implicate the innocent.

Furthermore, the Ying Heavenly Clan had submitted to Chu Luxuan now.

Chu Feng felt that unless Chu Luxuan was someone who was able to properly distinguish between grudges and grievances, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall would, sooner or later, suffer a calamity.

“Chu Luxuan? It doesn’t seem like he has had any intention to make things difficult for the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall so far,” Liu Xiaoli said.

“If that’s the case, it would appear that Chu Luxuan possesses a better moral character than his older brother,” Chu Feng said with a slight smile.

He had said those words in a questioning manner. After all, he had never met Chu Luxuan before, and did not know what sort of person he was.

“Lady Society Master, this is bad!” Right at that moment, an elder suddenly flew over from afar and landed on the mountain.

“Chu Feng?” That elder knew of Chu Feng. Thus, he was stunned the moment he landed and saw Chu Feng.

“Lady Society Master, is this... is he really Chu Feng?” The elder was a bit dumbfounded. Thus, he turned to request verification from Liu Xiaoli.

At that moment, Liu Xiaoli burst into loud laughter, “If he’s not real, could he possibly be fake?”

“Heavens! Little friend Chu Feng, you’re actually alive? This is truly great!”

The next moment, that elder was wild with joy. His reaction was just like that of Liu Xiaoli and the others earlier. He was extremely excited.

“Senior, this Chu Feng has been in closed-door training for the past two years without any sign of activity or news. I am sorry to have made you worry,” Chu Feng clasped his fist with a smile on his face.

The fact that this elder reacted in such a manner meant that he was extremely worried about him. Thus, Chu feng felt very moved.

“Oh, that’s right. Elder, what has happened?” Liu Xiaoli asked.

“Regarding this...” That elder took a glance at Chu Feng, and found it a bit embarrassing to speak.

“Could it be related to me?” Chu Feng asked.

Hearing those words, that elder’s expression stiffened, and he revealed a surprised expression.

His reaction had verified to Chu Feng and his guess was correct.

This bad news seemed to be related to him.
