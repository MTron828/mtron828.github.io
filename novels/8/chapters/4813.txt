Chapter 4813: Our Past

Zi Ling hugged Chu Feng tightly, afraid that he would vanish from her view if she were to loosen her grip by even a little.

On the other hand, Yu Ting stared at Chu Feng doubtfully, wondering if he was real or not.

However, Zi Ling had already believed that the person before her was the real Chu Feng whom she had spent countless nights dreaming of.

Chu Feng also hugged Zi Ling tightly as well as he stroked his long hair gently. The faint aroma coming from her smooth hair and her soft body was all so familiar to him, bringing his memories back to the Nine Provinces Continent.

It was in the forbidden area of the White Tiger Villa that they first met one another.

It wasn’t a pleasant meeting; they even crossed blows with one another as enemies, fighting over the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.

The next time he met was during a Marriage Gathering at the Prestigious Villa.

They braved through numerous life-and-death situations and slowly became familiar with one another. Eventually, love was born between them.

Their feelings ran so deep that even after the six great powers had placed an arrest warrant on Chu Feng, Zi Ling still declared loudly in front of the various powers during the Marriage Gathering, “The person whom I love... his name is Chu Feng”

One had to know that Chu Feng had been completely slandered by the six great powers by then. Everyone viewed him to be a despicable individual who deserved to be condemned to the lowest levels of hell, so it was obvious how the crowd would react to her declaration.

Some thought that it was inconceivable and wondered if they were hearing things.

To declare that the person she liked was Chu Feng despite being a member of the Prestigious Villa herself, this was indubitably an act that challenged the authority of the six great powers.

While everyone was wondering if they were hearing things, Zi Ling spoke once more with conviction.

“The person whom I love is Chu Feng. No matter how the world’s people see him, no matter how they loathe him, no matter how they hate him, I, Zi Ling, choose him. I do not waver on this, and I only approve of him.

“No person can shake my heart. No object can shake my heart. In this current life, I will only love Chu Feng and none other. My heart is willing, and I have no regrets.

“Today, I, Zi Ling, will withdraw from the Prestigious Villa and from now on, I am no longer a disciple of the Prestigious Villa, nor Villa Head Qin Lei’s foster daughter. From today on, no matter what I do, it is completely unrelated to the Prestigious Villa.”

That was the attitude she took back then. Even if she had to leave the Prestigious Villa and turn the entire world into her enemy, she was still determined to stand alongside Chu Feng.

Zi Ling’s feelings toward Chu Feng shocked everyone, and it also changed everyone’s perception of her.

Fortunately, Chu Feng didn’t let her down. He reciprocated her feelings and showed great care and concern for her.

In the battle at the Sword God Valley, Zi Ling was kidnapped and tortured by the Sword God Valley’s old ancestor. That enraged Chu Feng, and it was at that moment that his bloodline went berserk for the first time. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Before destroying the Sword God Valley, he declared loudly before everyone, “

“There will be, one day, when this sky shatters because of me, when this land collapses because of me, when the sun, moon, and stars change because of me.

“If that day, the one I love is no longer here, then I will make this world’s people die with her!”

Even though he had already lost his consciousness when he said those words and forgot about it afterward, it fully reflected what he felt back then. Had anything really happened to Zi Ling back then, he would have really gone on an indiscriminate massacre.

Many years had passed since then, but Chu Feng’s feelings for Zi Ling hadn’t lessened in the least. The same went for Zi Ling too.

“You must have suffered greatly,” Chu Feng said.

While Zi Ling’s talent was outstanding in the Nine Provinces Continent, it began showing its limitations afterward. In fact, she would have trouble trying to keep up with the prodigies of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, let alone a place like the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

While she did receive his father’s help, it definitely hadn’t been easy for her to come this far. Most mortals wouldn’t have been able to imagine the pain she had to suffer along the way.

“It’s nothing at all. Everything eventually led me to you, so what does all of those suffering count as? It’s just that...”

Zi Ling raised her head and stared at Chu Feng with doubtful eyes.

“Big brother Chu Feng, how did you manage to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?”

“This...”

Chu Feng had no idea how he should explain this matter.

Back then, Zi Ling did task Yu Ting to look for him, but she also told Yu Ting to deceive him so as to not worry him. It was just that Yu Ting broke her promise to Zi Ling and requested Chu Feng to save her afterward.

“I was the one who told him about your plight.”

While Chu Feng was wondering how he could hide the truth from Zi Ling, Yu Ting admitted to it candidly.

“Yu Ting, you...”

Zi Ling turned to look at Yu Ting, but she found herself unable to blame the latter for it. Instead, she started feeling self-reproach instead. She should have known that Yu Ting would have wanted to help her, so she should have never made this request from her in the first place.

Everything did end up well, but if something had happened to Chu Feng, she would have never been able to live with it.

“Alright, that’s enough. Had Yu Ting not told me about your plight, I wouldn’t have been here right now, standing before you. You were almost going to marry another man!” Chu Feng exclaimed.

Chu Feng tried to console her with a smile, but Zi Ling still felt deep self-reproach for endangering him.

“Chu Feng, you managed to defeat Zuoqiu Youyu? Doesn’t that mean that you have already surpassed him?” Yu Ting asked in astonishment.

She wasn’t sure what was going on with the matchmaking convention, but she was aware that Zuoqiu Youyu was fond of Zi Ling. Without a doubt, Zuoqiu Youyu would have been Chu Feng’s greatest opponent in the matchmaking convention.

“I didn’t manage to defeat Zuoqiu Youyu. In a way, you can say that a benefactor helped me,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

He began filling them in on everything that had happened during the matchmaking convention. Of course, he neglected to tell them that he entered the Hidden Dragon Life Tower and broke Lord Dugu Lingtian’s record there in order to truly earn the right to marry Zi Ling.

He knew that Zi Ling would surely blame herself if she learned about that, and he didn’t want her to feel burdened by this.

Zi Ling felt much more assured upon hearing the story. Not knowing the truth, she thought that the sectmaster was fond of Chu Feng.

Afterward, Chu Feng and Zi Ling settled down on the ground, but the latter still continued to snuggle in his embrace, refusing to let go at all.

Zi Ling was not a clingy person, but her current actions showed just how much she had missed Chu Feng over the years.

Meanwhile, Yu Ting tactfully chose to take her leave, though she did make sure to remind them not to do anything overboard as there were ears around them.

Zi Ling asked Chu Feng about what he had been through over the years. The latter tried his best to gloss over those dangerous situations, but she was still able to tell how much he had suffered in order to come this far.

Her eyes began to tear up as she gently stroked Chu Feng’s cheek.

“Your mother would be heartbroken if she learns of what you have been through.”

Chu Feng was surprised to hear those words. “What makes you say so?”

“Actually, you didn’t have to suffer through so much,” Zi Ling said.
