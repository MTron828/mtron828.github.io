Chapter 3179 - Strange Silhouette

“Very well, let us set off then,” Bai Liluo said.

“We’re leaving already?” Chu Feng was surprised. He had not expected Bai Liluo to be this hurried.

“You have something to take care of?” Bai Liluo asked with a frown on her face. It would appear that she was truly hurried.

“Nothing really. However, I can’t just leave like this, no? I must inform my clansmen first.”

“Moreover, the people from the Dongguo Heavenly Clan deliberately came to my aid. I still haven’t greeted them. Thus...”

“Enough, I got it.”

Before Chu Feng could finish, Bai Liluo cast a impatient glance at him. Then, Chu Feng felt his surroundings turning fuzzy again. When everything returned to normal, he had returned to the main city’s city walls.

Not only were the Chu Heavenly Clansmen still present, but the Mighty Dongguo Duo were also still present.

However, Bai Liluo did not reveal herself. Chu Feng knew that she must be in the vicinity. She was the one that sent Chu Feng back there. For her to not reveal herself, it was likely that she didn’t want to show herself.

“I am truly thankful for your help today,” upon returning, Chu Feng immediately walked over to the Mighty Dongguo Duo. He clasped his fist and expressed his thanks to them.

Although the Mighty Dongguo Duo’s presence did not manage to bring substantial help to the Chu Heavenly Clan, their willingness to provide assistance served to indicate the attitude of the Dongguo Heavenly Clan.

It was Chu Feng’s desire to be able to reconcile with the Dongguo Heavenly Clan. As such, he could not give the Mighty Dongguo Duo the cold shoulder.

Moreover, Chu Feng was truly grateful that the Mighty Dongguo Duo would come to their aid.

“Alas, brother Chu Feng, we are family. What we’ve done is what we should do. In the future, there’s no need for you to be this courteous with us.”

“As for the past, we only severed our relationship with your Chu Heavenly Clan because of that Chu Hongyi. If the ones that were in the wrong back then were willing to apologize for their mistake sooner, we wouldn’t have ignored the Chu Heavenly Clan’s circumstances for so long.”

“In the end, it’s because there’s too few people of understanding like brother Chu Feng in the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Otherwise, our Dongguo Heavenly Clan would’ve definitely reconciled with the Chu Heavenly Clan long ago,” the elder of the Mighty Dongguo Duo said.

He said all that because he wanted to let Chu Feng know that it was not their Dongguo Heavenly Clan that was in the wrong when they severed their relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan. He did not wish Chu Feng to hold a grudge for what happened back then.

“The Dongguo Heavenly Clan doesn’t owe our Chu Heavenly Clan anything. For the Dongguo Heavenly Clan to be willing to lend a helping hand to our Chu Heavenly Clan during our moment of crisis, I, Chu Feng, will firmly remember this kindness.”

“While I don’t dare guarantee for others, I, Chu Feng, can represent myself. From today on, I, Chu Feng, will share both honor and disgrace with the Dongguo Heavenly Clan,” Chu Feng said. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Very well. To be able to obtain such a pledge from brother Chu Feng, our Dongguo Heavenly Clan will definitely share both honor and disgrace with the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Oh, that’s right, Soon, it will be the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Celebration of the New Excellence. You must not forget about it, and definitely show up.”

“How about this: we’ll come and receive you all when the time comes. We can all proceed there together,” the elder of the Mighty Dongguo Duo said.

Hearing the words ‘Celebration of the New Excellence,’ Chu Ping revealed a surprised expression and asked in disbelief, “Celebration of the New Excellence?” Our Chu Heavenly Clan is able to participate in it this time?”

“Leave this matter to our Dongguo Heavenly Clan,” the younger of the Mighty Dongguo Duo patted his chest.

“We will have to trouble you all,” Chu Ping spoke gratefully.

“Alas, we are family, there’s no need to regard us as outsiders,” the elder of the Mighty Dongguo Duo said.

After that, the Mighty Dongguo Duo exchanged some conventional greetings with Chu Feng began leaving.

“Big brother Chu Ping, what is this Celebration of the New Excellence?” Chu Feng asked.

Hearing Chu Feng ask about it, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu also moved over.

After all, they were able to tell from the name that this so-called Celebration of the New Excellence should be related to them.

In fact, the Celebration of the New Excellence was indeed related to them. This Celebration of the New Excellence was precisely held for people that had just arrived at the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm like Chu Feng and the others.

Due to the special power of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, people that had just entered, like Chu Feng and the others, would have a special sort of power on them.

When enough of them were gathered together, they would be able to summon a spirit formation in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s Overlord Region. As for that spirit formation, it was specially used for training.

Because of that, whenever newbies entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, the Overlord Region would always hold this Celebration of the New Excellence.

That said, the so-called Celebration of the New Excellence was not something that all the newly-arrived people would be able to participate in. The four directional regions were each allowed ten powers to enter the Overlord Region and bring their excellent new members to participate in the Celebration of the New Excellence.

As the Eastern Region was composed of many different powers, it would naturally be impossible for the Chu Heavenly Clan, given how weak they were, to enter the Overlord Region.

Not to mention after falling out with the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, even before they had their falling out with the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, the Chu heavenly Clan still did not have the qualifications to participate in the Celebration of the New Excellence.

The reason for that was because the Chu Heavenly Clan was simply too weak. Even if the Dongguo Heavenly Clan wanted to help them, they would have to put forth enormous effort. Thus, even when the relationship between the Dongguo Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan was still good, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan had never sought an opportunity to have the Chu Heavenly Clan participate in the Celebration of the New Excellence.

However, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan was now actually willing to help them. This came as a great surprise to Chu Ping. That was the reason why he became so excited.

“Although we’ve never been to the Overlord Region before, and have never witnessed the Celebration of the New Excellence, I’ve heard that the spirit formation brought forth by the Celebration of the New Excellence is very powerful, and will provide enormous assistance to you all, people that have just entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”

“Little sister Shuangshaung, little brother Chu Feng, to you all, this is definitely an exceptionally good opportunity. You must make sure to grasp it,” Chu Ping said.

“When is this Celebration of the New Excellence going to be held?” Chu Feng asked Chu Ping.

The reason why he asked was because he did not know when he would return with Bai Liluo. Chu Feng wanted to know if he would have enough time.

“Rest assured, big sister will definitely let you make it in time for that Celebration of the New Excellence.”

Right at that moment, Bai Liluo’s voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ears.

Sure enough, it was as Chu Feng had anticipated, Bai Liluo was beside him the entire time. She had merely concealed herself.

After sensing how urgent Bai Liluo was, Chu Feng stopped talking with Chu Ping and the others. He directly informed them to not leave the main city during the time when he was gone.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng would activate the grand defensive formation while he was away. That grand defensive formation would be able to protect them.

If it were someone else telling Chu Ping and the others those things, they would definitely not believe that person.

However, as the person who said those words was Chu Feng, they believed Chu Feng completely. After all, Chu Feng had never lied to them.

After Chu Feng finished handling everything, he left with Bai Liluo.

As for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they obediently stayed within the main city.

At that moment, only the people from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan were outside the main city.

Having lost their minds, they were running about like walking corpses.

No, apart from the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen, there was another figure. It was a black silhouette. No one was able to see it. No one was able to detect it. In fact, one could not even be certain as to what it was.

Not long after Chu Feng and Bai Liluo left, that black silhouette also left. However, it did not follow Chu Feng and Bai Liluo, for it left in the opposite direction.

It was moving toward the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.
