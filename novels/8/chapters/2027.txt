Chapter 2027 - Five Elements Treasures

Although Chu Feng had not informed the experts of the Cyanwood Mountain or the Ancient Era’s Elves, he was still filled with confidence.

This caused the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal to feel even more uneasy. Even though the World Devastator Immortal was stronger than Chu Feng, and it would be very easy for him to kill Chu Feng, Chu Feng was currently looking at him with a gaze that held no fear.

Instead, Chu Feng’s eyes were filled with disdain. It was as if Chu Feng was the tiger and he was the sheep, that Chu Feng could kill him at any moment.

Feeling extremely uneasy, the World Devastator Immortal shouted at Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, exactly what are you planning?”

“Hehe...” Chu Feng laughed lightly. He leapt forward and arrived at the grand spirit formation in the sky. His hands began to interweave with one another as he formed a special hand seal. Then, he said, “You two wish to know? Very well, I’ll let you know right now.”

“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh ~~~”

Suddenly, that grand spirit formation started to emit bright silvery light. At that moment, silver bodies of light shot out from the spirit formation like a meteor shower.

Those silver bodies of lights all descended onto the wonderstones.

“Crack, snap~~~”

Soon, those wonderstones started to shatter. Merely, it was only the surfaces of the wonderstones that shattered. The insides were still intact. Not only that, many different beings were revealed from within the shattered wonderstones.

Some possessed humanoid appearances, whereas others possessed beast-like appearances. Although their bodies were all made of stone, all of them possessed a pair of ferocious crimson eyes.

Most importantly, those stone monsters were not only all alive, they all possessed Martial Emperor-level cultivations.

Furthermore, the amount of stone monsters that Chu Feng had awoken with the spirit formation numbered several tens of thousands.

“This... this... this!!!”

At that moment, not to mention the Immeasurable Immortal, even the World Devastator Immortal was shocked speechless.

There were no less than a hundred thousand stone monsters with cultivations of Martial Emperors. The weakest among them were rank one Martial Emperors. The great majority of them were between rank three and rank six Martial Emperors.

Although there were not a lot of stone monsters above rank six Martial Emperor, there were still quite a bit. Among them, the strongest possessed the same level of cultivation as the World Devastator Immortal; they were rank eight Martial Emperors.

“How could this be? How could this be?! Exactly what is going on? What the hell are these things?!!!”

The World Devastator Immortal did not dare to believe the scene before him.

This was truly too shocking. Even though all of the wonderstones here had existed since the Ancient Era, no one had ever thought that the wonderstones would be such powerful existences.

“Didn’t you all want to know what sort of secret was contained in the Five Elements Old Ancestor’s Five Elements Secret Skills?”

“I shall allow you all to experience the secret contained in the Five Elements Secret Skills.”

“Kill them,” Chu Feng pointed to the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal.

“Rooarrr~~~~”

Once Chu Feng’s order was given, the hundred thousand stone monsters immediately emitted ear-piercing roars.

Following that, like an army following a command, the hundred thousand stone monsters began to surround the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal.

Among them, the two stone monsters with the cultivation of rank eight Martial Emperor bore the brunt of the attack. In a flash, they arrived before the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal.

These two stone monsters were both a hundred meters tall. They were like two small mountains. Not only were they humanoid in appearance, they were also donned in armor like two generals.

Standing before the World Devastator Immortal, the two of them were truly giants.

Furthermore, although their weapons were only stones, they would always emit dazzling sparks when they collided with the World Devastator Immortal’s Imperial Armament. They were extremely powerful.

In this sort of situation, the World Devastator Immortal did not dare to fight against them at close range. Instead, he escaped into the sky, and began to unleash martial skills to fight against the two stone monsters.

However, not only were those two stone monsters very ferocious in terms of close range combat, their long range attacks were also extremely strong. They opened their mouths and shot out clouds and mists. Furthermore, they possessed full control over the power of the five elements. In fact, during the times when they released their most frightening attacks, their attacks were able to reach the level of Heaven Taboo Martial Skills.

“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”

The World Devastator Immortal collided with the two stone monsters.

One thing worthy of being mentioned was that the stone monsters with weaker strength stopped attempting to fight and instead stood to the side the moment the battle between the World Devastator Immortal and the two rank eight Martial Emperor stone monsters started fighting.

Actually, if they were to attempt to join the battle, they would only cause trouble for themselves. After all, it was impossible for them, with their strength, to kill the World Devastator Immortal.

Thus, it was most sensible for them to move to the side and simply spectate.

All of this was seen by the Immeasurable Immortal. Then, he looked to Chu Feng who was standing in the sky.

He thought to himself that, if all of this was controlled by Chu Feng, it would be understandable. However, if those stone monsters acted that way by themselves, it would be too frightening.

A total of a hundred thousand stone monsters, with the weakest among them being rank one Martial Emperors. If they were to join the battle between the Dark Hall and the Ancient Era’s Elves, the Dark Hall’s superiority in the battle would be obliterated completely. Furthermore, they would definitely enter a disadvantaged state.

“Wuuahh~~~”

Right at that moment, the World Devastator Immortal suddenly vomited a mouthful of blood.

He was injured. The World Devastator Immortal, a grand rank eight Martial Emperor, was injured by those two rank eight Martial Emperor stone monsters.

“Let’s go.”

Sensing that the situation was bad, the World Devastator Immortal did not dare to stay any longer. He grabbed the Immeasurable Immortal and began to escape.

“After them.”

How could Chu Feng possibly allow them to escape? He gave the order, and the two armored stone monsters began to pursue them relentlessly on foot.

“Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”

With each step, they caused the heaven and earth to tremble. Their speed was extremely fast.

Unfortunately, although the World Devastator Immortal was no match for the two armored stone monsters head-on, his speed when fleeing was truly not to be reckoned with. Even though the two stone monsters were extremely fast, they were still unable to catch up to the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal.

Seeing that, Chu Feng had no choice but to order the two stone monsters to return.

Even though the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal had escaped and taken that scroll with them, Chu Feng did not feel any trace of sadness other than a bit of regret. Instead, he was feeling extremely joyous.

“The true treasures of the Five Elements Secret Skills are here.”

As Chu Feng looked to the hundred thousand stone monsters, he was truly unable to contain his happiness. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The strength of those stone monsters were truly not weak. In fact, they could even be said to be extremely strong.

Earlier, Chu Feng had merely given a single order telling them to attack. They complied with Chu Feng’s order without Chu Feng having to control them the entire time.

In other words, it was the stone monsters’ own decision to not interfere in the battle between the World Devastator Immortal and the two rank eight Martial Emperor-level stone monsters.

Although they were not actual living beings, and were only weapons formed by the Five Elements Old Ancestor through special methods, they were extremely high-level and truly frightening.

Treasures. Who would dare to say that they were not treasures? As long as one gained control of those stone monsters, even the Three Palaces would have to submit to them.

And now, Chu Feng was the ruler of these treasures.

“Follow me into battle.”

“Roar~~~~~~~~~~~~”

Once Chu Feng gave the order, the hundred thousand stone monsters let out a roar. Then, they followed Chu Feng in the direction of the Ancient Era’s Elves.

After Chu Feng left leading the majestic army of a hundred thousand stone monsters, the sky in the distance suddenly started to distort. Soon, a figure appeared from that place.

That person... had a naked upper body, and only wore a large pair of underpants on his lower body. On his feet were two different-colored straw sandals. It was none other than Wang Qiang.

Merely, at that moment, Wang Qiang had a serious expression on his face. He smiled lightly, then said, “I-It w-w-w-would appear that my decision to f-f-follow him h-here was n-not required.”

After he finished saying those words, Wang Qiang started to laugh. He placed his hands into his underpants and, while still in midair, swaggered off into the distance.

Although his each and every step appeared to be very slow, he actually traveled a distance of a thousand miles with a single step.
