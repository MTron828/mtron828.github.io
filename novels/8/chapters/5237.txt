Chapter 5237: I’ll Slaughter Them

“Ah, it’s Elder Daokui. I’m Chu Feng. It’s my honor to meet you.”

Despite not having heard of the name ‘Shengguang Daokui’, Chu Feng stood up and greeted the other party. It was only right to maintain a respectful attitude toward one’s elders.

It was just that Chu Feng had chosen to introduce himself via voice transmission.

“Young friend Chu Feng, please have a seat. It looks like they didn’t mention my name to you. Haa, I have been away for too long that they appear to have forgotten about me,” Shengguang Daokui sighed with a playful tone to alleviate the awkward atmosphere.

“Waiter, bring me another bowl of Superior Immortal Wine!”

Shengguang Daokui took out an Exalted Armament and slammed it on the table.

In truth, the waiter had been staring at Chu Feng for a while now, ready to chase the latter out of the tavern if he still wasn’t going to order anything. When he saw that Shengguang Daokui was ordering wine for Chu Feng, he quickly rushed forward to accept the payment.

“Waiter, take this instead.”

Before the waiter could take the Exalted Armament, Chu Feng took out an Exalted Armament of his own and handed it to him.

The waiter’s eyes lit up upon seeing the Exalted Armament, and his respect for Chu Feng deepened. In truth, he had reserved his doubts as to whether Chu Feng had the money to afford their Superior Immortal Wine, especially after overhearing their conversation.

He thought that Chu Feng was fawning on Shengguang Daokui to have the latter pay on his behalf. Yet, Chu Feng actually brought out an Exalted Armament of his own to pay for his own wine.

It was one thing if Chu Feng was an elder, but he was clearly just a junior!

Shengguang Daokui didn’t say a word about Chu Feng’s actions, but there was a subtle change in his gaze when he looked at Chu Feng. He finally understood why a junior like Chu Feng was able to become acquainted with so many top figures in their Holy Valley.

Without a doubt, Chu Feng was no ordinary junior.

“Waiter, is there a limit to how much wine each customer can buy?” Chu Feng asked.

“Esteemed customer, there are no limits to that,” the waiter replied.

“Get me another two more bowls of wine,” Chu Feng said as he took out another two more Exalted Armaments.

Those words drew the attention of the other customers in the tavern.

Most people who visited the tavern would only buy one bowl of wine. An Exalted Armament for a single bowl of wine was an exorbitant price to pay, after all. They wouldn’t be able to take anything more than that.

Yet, Chu Feng ordered three bowls at once.

“Young friend, are you going to drink three bowls of wine?”

Shengguang Daokui also looked at Chu Feng in surprise.

“Elder, I’ll take two bowls and treat you to one. I hope that you’ll accept my token of goodwill,” Chu Feng said.

“Interesting. All right, I’ll accept your token of goodwill,” Shengguang Daokui heartily accepted the gift.

It didn’t take long for the three bowls of Superior Immortal Wine to be served. Chu Feng picked up a bowl and said, “Junior Chu Feng proposes a toast to elder.”

He then gulped down the entire bowl of wine.

Shengguang Daokui did the same.

“What fine wine!” Chu Feng exclaimed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

While the alcohol was strong, it had an incredible fragrance that had slowly settled down over several millennia. The complexity of the flavors came together in a marvelous way that made one’s eyes lit up. It also had a smooth texture and easily flowed down his throat, leaving him feeling invigorated.

More importantly, it had the effect of prolonging one’s longevity.

Such delicacies were truly rare in the world. As exorbitant as an Exalted Armament was, Chu Feng thought that the wine was worth the price.

As for his second bowl of wine, Chu Feng didn’t gulp it down in a single mouthful but instead slowly sipped on it.

“How is it, young friend Chu Feng? Do you think the wine is worth the price?” Shengguang Daokui asked with a smile.

“Yes, it’s worth the price. The Qian Clan Tavern is indeed worthy of being labeled the second greatest in the Totem Galaxy,” Chu Feng replied.

“Esteemed customer, I’d have to refute your words,” the tavern manager suddenly spoke up.

“First and foremost, our Qian Clan Tavern sells wine whereas the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber sells spring water. Those are very different products. If we’re just talking about wine, our Qian Clan Tavern is indisputably number one.

“Even if we toss aside the semantics, there’s still no question that our Qian Clan Tavern is currently number one in the Totem Galaxy,” the tavern manager said with a gleeful smile.

Those words piqued the curiosity of those present.

The Dragon Breath Spring Chamber had been acknowledged to be the number one beverage seller in the Totem Galaxy by a huge margin, not to mention that the Dragon Breath Clan was a strong clan too.

It seemed out of place for the tavern manager to make such a proclamation.

“You must have not heard the latest news. We have received news that the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber has met with an ordeal and vanished from the world of cultivation.”

Those words sparked a huge commotion.

“Manager, are you certain about that?” a man asked.

“I wouldn’t dare to run my mouth about such matters. There are eye-witnesses who saw gigantic red hands simultaneously grabbing the Dragon Breath Spring Chambers from all over the Totem Galaxy. There have been no sightings of any Dragon Breath Spring Chamber ever since then, which suggests a grim fate for them,” the tavern manager said.

“Gigantic red hands simultaneously grabbed all of the Dragon Breath Spring Chambers? Who in the world did the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber offend?”

“Gigantic red hands… Which sect or clan is that? I have never heard of anything like that before.”

Discussions broke out inside the tavern. Even Chu Feng was intrigued by the matter too, having been to the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber before. He couldn’t help but wonder which power had the means to pull such a feat off.

Once again, he was reminded of just how weak he currently was.

This world is simply too dangerous. I need to quickly raise my cultivation.

“I didn’t think that the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber would disappear just like that. What a pity that I haven’t gotten a chance to taste it yet,” Shengguang Daokui sighed softly.

He then turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Young friend Chu Feng, did you come here all alone?”

“Yes,” Chu Feng replied.

“Do you have business in the Totem Galaxy? Or are you here to explore the world?” Shengguang Daokui asked.

“I have business here,” Chu Feng replied.

“What business do you have here?” Shengguang Daokui asked.

“Vengeance,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Vengeance?”

Shengguang Daokui was surprised to hear those words. He turned to Chu Feng to assess his expression, but the latter didn’t seem to be joking around. Thus, he sent a voice transmission over and asked, “Who is your enemy? Do you need any help?”

Shengguang Daokui knew what those people from the Holy Valley were like. Chu Feng had to be truly close to the Holy Valley in order to know their names, and he naturally considered those who were close to the Holy Valley as his friend too.

That was also why he was willing to expend an Exalted Armament to treat Chu Feng to a drink even though they had only just met.

It was just that vengeance was not something to be taken lightly. He was worried that a junior like Chu Feng might make a wrong step and fall to his doom.

“I’m grateful for your goodwill, but I wish to deal with this myself,” Chu Feng said.

“Good!” Shengguang Daokui complimented.

He had never seen such confidence in the juniors of the Holy Light Galaxy, including those from the Holy Valley. It was not to say that the juniors of the Holy Light Galaxy had low self-esteem, but the Totem Galaxy was not a place to be taken lightly.

Which junior in the Holy Light Galaxy would dare to venture alone into the Totem Galaxy to exact vengeance on an enemy?

“Elder, do you possess any means to conceal your appearance?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s inevitable to encounter enemies while traversing the world of cultivation. It’s only normal for me to be in possession of such means. Young friend, why do you ask that?” Shengguang Daokui asked.

“My enemies are already after my life. I fear that you might be implicated into my problems given that so many people have witnessed our meeting here,” Chu Feng said.

“Hahaha!”

Shengguang Daokui suddenly burst into laughter.

“Young friend, worry not. I’m not afraid of that!” he said confidently.

Chu Feng’s heart calmed down upon hearing those words. He was worried about implicating Shengguang Daokui in his affairs.

“Welcome, esteemed customers!”

A waiter suddenly greeted loudly as three old men stepped into the tavern.

Chu Feng glanced over but avoided meeting their gazes. He could tell right away that they were from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but he didn’t want to be recognized here now that he was sitting together with Shengguang Daokui.

From the wine gourds carried by the three old men from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, it could be seen that they were alcohol fanatics.

As none of them were concealing their cultivation, Chu Feng could tell that two of them were at rank eight Martial Exalted level whereas the last one was at rank nine Martial Exalted level.

None of them were weak, but they were within Chu Feng’s means to deal with.

“Waiter, three bowls of Superior Immortal Wine. Take to go.”

The three old men passed their respective wine gourds to the waiter together with an Exalted Armament each.

Some of the other customers in the tavern subconsciously glanced at Chu Feng upon seeing that sight. The three old men of the Situ World Spiritist Clan had chosen to order only a single bowl despite being alcohol fanatics, but Chu Feng actually ordered three bowls by himself.

This reflected just how wealthy Chu Feng was.

Chu Feng felt awkward as he didn’t want to be the center of attention at a time like this.

It was fortunate that the three arrogant old men didn’t pay any attention to the others in the tavern. They didn’t think that anyone in here was worthy of their time. Even so, there were still quite a few people who stood up to greet them.

The Spirit Beast Upper Realm was the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s territory, after all. Many of those currently in the tavern had traveled here to watch the junior hunting competition.

The three old men responded to those who were greeting them with a lackadaisical and even impatient attitude.

“Young friend, did you come here for the junior hunting competition too? They are the organizers of the competition—Situ World Spiritist Clan. You mustn’t get on their wrong side,” Shengguang Daokui whispered.

Chu Feng smiled at those words.

Get on their wrong side? I, Chu Feng, am here to massacre those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan.
