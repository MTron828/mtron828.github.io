Chapter 5736: Extraordinary Power?

“Don’t say that. It’s with your own capability that you reached your current height. I didn’t do much to help. However, there’s one matter I may need to trouble you with. I’m going to enter the Ninth Galaxy very soon. You also know those who enter the Ninth Galaxy won’t be able to leave anymore. I’ll be leaving very soon, or else I might miss some fortuitous encounters.

“However, I suspect there’s something special about this iteration of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, especially since it’s held here. I fear that an extraordinary power might emerge from this, and that might alarm some existences,” Zhang Yingxiong’s master said.

“Elder, could the extraordinary power you speak about refer to…” Song Changsheng thought of a possibility.

“It’s as you have guessed,” Zhang Yingxiong’s master said.

Song Changsheng’s eyes turned grim. “Is it finally going to appear?”

“I’m not sure, but those existences will vie for it if it does. If it’s a fight between juniors, it’ll just go to the most capable one. However, it’ll be unfair if those from the older generations interfere. Changsheng, I know you don’t like to get involved in such affairs, but things are different this time around. I honestly hope that the Nine Heavens’ Zenith can be successfully held,” Zhang Yingxiong’s master said.

“Elder, I’ll do my best to fulfill your wish,” Song Changsheng said.

“Mm. Let’s hope no one will cause trouble there,” Zhang Yingxiong’s master said.

…

Chu Feng and Zhang Yingxiong crossed blows for two hours, but there was no victor. The formation dissipated, and the wooden swords in their hands disappeared. They were brought from the formation realm back to the real world.

By then, the two of them were sweating profusely and gasping for air. This spar had taken a lot out of them. Neither could let their guard down as their opponent was simply too powerful, or else the slightest carelessness could result in their defeat.

Maintaining an extreme state of focus was no easy feat.

Despite being thoroughly exhausted in body and in mind, both of them were smiling brightly. They might not have decided a victor, but it was an exhilarating fight for them.

“You’re truly a monster, Brother Chu Feng,” Zhang Yingxiong exclaimed.

“The same can be said about you too,” Chu Feng replied.

He had personally experienced how formidable Zhang Yingxiong was during the clash. Not only did the latter have plenty of combat experience, but his mind was also flexible enough to deal with any unexpected situation. On top of that, his swordsmanship was incredible too.

“The next time we spar will likely be in the Immemorial Domain of Gods. I believe you’ll be able to cross blows with me with your own cultivation by then,” Zhang Yingxiong said.

“Let’s hope so,” Chu Feng replied with a sigh.

He knew that this fight couldn’t be considered fair, as the formation had handicapped Zhang Yingxiong more than him. Had it been a normal battle, he would have lost straight away.

“I’ll give this to you,” Zhang Yingxiong said as he pointed his finger at Chu Feng, and a streak of light seeped into the latter’s body.

Chu Feng lowered his head and saw an imprint on his chest, but the imprint swiftly disappeared. It could no longer be found on his body or in his soul, but he could still sense it. Something appeared to be hidden in the imprint, but he couldn’t tell what it was.

Thus, he looked at Zhang Yingxiong and asked, “What is that?”

“I’m not sure either. My master tasked me to give it to you. You’ll know what it is when the time is right,” Zhang Yingxiong said.

“I’m really curious about your master.”

“You’ll know in due time. My master has a high opinion of you.”

Zhang Yingxiong walked up to Chu Feng and placed his hand on the Heaven-devouring Qilin’s imprint on his chest. “You better not mess around. Trust me, you don’t want to offend this brother of mine. If anything happens to him, you’ll die.”

Needless to say, those words were directed to Heaven-devouring Qilin. He could actually see through the imprint!

Chu Feng wasn’t too surprised though, as he knew that Zhang Yingxiong’s master was a person with great means.

After issuing a warning to the Heaven-devouring Qilin, Zhang Yingxiong turned to Chu Feng, clasped his fist, and said, “Brother Chu Feng, I’ll be leaving first. See you in the Immemorial Domain of Gods.”

He formed a hand seal, and a surge of teleportation energy enveloped him. Before he left, he hesitantly looked at Chu Feng and said, “Brother Chu Feng, you need to be careful when dealing with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and that grandfather of yours too. Neither of them are as simple as they seem.”

Zhang Yingxiong left after leaving those words behind.

Chu Feng fell into deep thoughts.

He had known that the waters in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion ran deeper than what he could see, but he hadn’t expected Zhang Yingxiong to offer him a warning about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. Given Zhang Yingxiong’s background, it was best to take his words seriously.

Zhang Yingxiong returned to the boat, where his master was awaiting him. As soon as he appeared, he slumped to the ground and lay weakly.

“Injured?” Zhang Yingxiong’s master asked.

“No, I’m just exhausted from the battle,” Zhang Yingxiong replied with a smile.

“What’s your impression of Chu Feng?”

“I might lose to him at this rate.”

“It’s good you realize that, lest you think you’re really invincible.”

The boat began to move at an extremely fast speed toward the Ninth Galaxy.

“Master, are the juniors of the Ninth Galaxy even more formidable?” Zhang Yingxiong asked.

“Not necessarily. You might have already met the strongest juniors out there. You shouldn’t look down on the juniors gathered at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. There might be others aside from Chu Feng who can match you,” Zhang Yingxiong’s master said.

“Oh?” Zhang Yingxiong was initially taken aback, then an expectant smile formed on his lips. “That sounds interesting.”

…

Chu Feng took a moment to condition himself before stepping into the test ground.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The moment he passed through the peculiar palace doors, he found himself restrained by a tremendous surge of energy. The surge of energy removed his concealment before diving into his body to attack his soul.

This was probably the first trial. Those who failed to endure it would be eliminated.

Such a test usually wouldn’t even faze Chu Feng, but he was in an extremely weakened state after spending two hours fighting a hyper-intense battle with Zhang Yingxiong. It was torturous for him to undergo the trial in his current state.

Nevertheless, he still managed to hold on.

By the time the energy disappeared, Chu Feng was already standing in the midst of a massive mountain range. He could sense that he was in a humongous and complicated realm, and it wouldn’t be an easy feat to clear this test.

He glanced at the countdown in the sky, which indicated that the test would soon end. No one else was around him, as those who wanted to participate in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith had already challenged the test by now. There was no point entering at this juncture, and it was impossible to clear it within such a short period of time.

Chu Feng knew that he needed to hurry, but it was hard to do so in a weakened state. He had barely conditioned his state, but he had to exert himself a fair bit in the earlier formation. This resulted in a decline in the keenness of his observation and other attributes.

Thus, instead of advancing ahead, he took out a pill and sat on the floor, preparing to condition his state once more.

“Who is it?” Chu Feng suddenly sensed someone in the vicinity and quickly got up.

Several figures appeared in the distance and quickly approached him. Within moments, they had already encircled him.
