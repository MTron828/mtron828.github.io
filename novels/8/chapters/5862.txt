Chapter 5863: The Identity of the Woman In a White Dress

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist traveled across space, but his destination was not the Ninth Galaxy but a realm just at the boundaries of the Nine Souls Galaxy. He headed straight for a mountain and landed at its peak.

The space at the mountaintop shook, and a massive figure emerged. It was a demon fox that was over a thousand meters long—the Thousand Transformations Monstrous Fox.

“Milord.” The fox immediately bowed to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“How long have you been back for?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I have been for some days. I have been waiting for you here under your directions,” the fox replied.

“How did that matter go? Did that fellow succeed?”

“Milord, it went well.”

“Are you sure? I want it to be an impetus for my disciple, not a hindrance. Don’t blame me for punishing you if you screw up here,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said with cold eyes.

“Rest assured, milord. I have confirmed the matter before returning. As powerful as that monstrous beast is, it has fused well. I didn’t spot any anomaly,” the Thousand Transformations Monstrous Fox replied.

“That would be for the best,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he landed on top of the Thousand Transformations Monstrous Fox. “Let’s head to the Ninth Galaxy.”

...

It was some time later before the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster opened her eyes. Her injuries had been so severe that she remained weakened despite having healed up a fair bit.

The first thing she did upon waking up was to scan her surroundings. She quickly saw the woman in a white dress standing not too far away, unharmed. She also noticed that the protective formation was not only intact but had reverted to normal. That put her mind at ease.

“You’re awake.” The woman in a white dress glanced at the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

“Elder, were you the one who drove the Ancient Era’s clans back?” The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster quickly got up.

“I’m not strong enough,” the woman in a white dress bitterly shook her head and replied.

She proceeded to tell the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster what had happened after the latter fell unconscious, but she had passed out too when a formation enveloped her. Thus, all she knew was that Puppeteer Exalted had intended to use them to channel the formation core.

She had no idea how it all unfolded to the current state.

“There’s a strong blood stench here. It looks like many people have died here. Did someone help us? Could it be the lords dwelling in the depths of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked.

There was not a corpse to be seen, but they could sense the aura of the Ancient Era’s clans amidst the blood stench. From that, they deduced that the Ancient Era’s clans must have suffered heavy losses and that they were safe for now.

“That’s possible, but there is another possibility,” the woman in a white dress said.

“Another possibility? Who else could it be?” The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was baffled.

There were unfathomably powerful existences in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and those existences could have saved them. The problem was that those existences weren’t interested in secular affairs, so there was no reason for them to make a move.

“The rumor might be true,” the woman in a white dress said.

“What rumor?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked.

“This is not the first time that the powerful clans in the vast world of cultivation have attacked our Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but they have failed to conquer it because someone has been secretly protecting it. No one knows who this person is, but this rumor seems to have some credibility to it.”

“I have heard of that rumor too, but does the Ancestral Martial Galaxy really have someone like that considering the circumstances?”

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster was skeptical of the rumor. She had been living in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy all along, so she was the most familiar with its situation. If such a person protects their Ancestral Martial Galaxy, how could he let it continue declining like that?

“Forget it, the important thing is that everyone is safe. You can settle the rest, right?” the woman in a white dress asked.

“Elder, are you going to leave?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked.

“Mm.” The woman in a white dress nodded.

“Elder, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect needs you. Won’t you consider coming back? You’re more qualified than me to take the seat of the sectmaster.”

“I left the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect because I didn’t want to be restrained. Besides, you should have known that those powers can’t pose a threat to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect if you chose to hide in it. You shouldn’t get so nosey. Even if they go on a massacre, their blades will never reach our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.”

“Our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect has always shouldered the responsibility of protecting the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. We can turn a blind eye to it under other circumstances, but this time around, they came under the pretext of attacking our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. I won’t be able to face our founder and predecessors if the Ancestral Martial Galaxy was destroyed due to us.”

“Forget it. You’re the sectmaster. You can decide for yourself.” The woman in a white dress shook her head helplessly. “I have to say that you did good taking in Chu Feng and Zi Ling. That’s a huge contribution to our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Our sect will prosper once more thanks to the two of them.”

The woman in a white dress tossed a Cosmos Sack over to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. “Pass this to Chu Feng in my stead. Also, do advise him to stay inside our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and not to head out if he doesn’t have anything up. Many enemies are after his life now.”

“I will try to talk to him, but I doubt he’ll listen given his personality. Given his cultivation, I won’t be able to stop him even if I want to,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster replied with a helpless voice.

“It’s at least worth a try. If he doesn’t listen, so be it. He can look for me if he gets into trouble,” the woman in a white dress said.

“Should he look for you at the True Essence Mountain?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked.

“He’ll know where to look for me once he opens the Cosmos Sack. I’ll be leaving.”

The woman in a white dress rose into the sky and flitted off. She was a Heavenly God level cultivator, after all; she disappeared in the blink of an eye. Even so, she continued scanning her surroundings with wary eyes, not knowing if there were experts in the vicinity eyeing her.

To be safe, she took out a treasure to conceal herself.

...

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster spent a moment examining the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, but she dared not approach it after realizing that it was extremely dangerous. Thus, she returned to the realm where Chu Feng and the others were.

Chu Feng was still unconscious.

The others rushed over to ask her what happened. They couldn’t see what was happening as they weren’t in control of the protective formation. Thus, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster filled them in on the details.

Not knowing if they were safe, the crowd remained on alert.

...

The woman in a white dress flitted out of the Eastern Region before bringing out a floating warship with a wave of her hand. It was identical to the warship Chu Feng had ridden to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

Upon getting onto the warship, she changed into the robes of the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild and put on a special mask.

It turned out she was the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s guild leader.
