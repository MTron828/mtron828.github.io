Chapter 4638: Despicable Means

“Thank you, Lord Black Demon.”

While this world spiritist cloak was useless to Chu Feng, who already had the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, there was still no denying that it was of great value. On top of that, it was more of a medal of honor, so naturally, Chu Feng accepted it joyfully.

While he stowed the Crystalfeather Immortal Cloak away, he specially shot a glance at Gongsun Yuntian, and coincidentally, Gongsun Yuntian happened to be looking at him at that moment too.

The two of them ended up exchanging gazes, and Chu Feng could see that Gongsun Yuntian’s complexion was more livid than ever.

His eyes were filled with not just envy but murderous intent too. It looked as if he would devour Chu Feng whole if could.

In return, Chu Feng simply responded with a slight smirk, which made Gongsun Yuntian gnash his teeth together.

It was no exaggeration to say that Gongsun Yuntian hated Chu Feng down to his bone right now. There was no way he could remain unfazed when the honor that should have belonged to him was snatched by Chu Feng right before his eyes.

“Lord Black Demon, you mustn’t give the Crystalfeather Immortal Cloak to Chu Feng! I don’t know how he managed to do it, but he was able to control the formations inside the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. It was through tapping into the powers of the palace’s formation that he was able to achieve what he usually wouldn’t have been able to do.

“He was arrogant in there, and he even attempted to kill us. If not for Gongsun Yuntian stepping in to save us, two of our brothers would have lost our lives there. Even though Chu Feng was the first one to leave the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, the means he used were unfair and despicable! I beseech Lord Black Demon to look into it and redress our grievances!”

The prodigies of the Gongsun Clan began pinning all sorts of accusations on Chu Feng, even going to the extent of bringing out the two prodigies who had been spared by Chu Feng earlier.

After all, the Wretched Black Demon had explicitly said that they weren’t to attack one another in the Thousand Transformation Illusory Palace, or else the challenger would be immediately disqualified.

Given the current circumstances, the only way to bring about a reversal was to smear mud on Chu Feng and attempt to have him disqualified.

At the same moment, Gongsun Yuntian also turned to look at the duo whom Chu Feng had spared. The duo was put in a spot, but they soon made up their minds.

With a loud ‘putong’, they fell to their knees and began crying tearfully to the Wretched Black Demon, “Lord Black Demon, what my brothers said is true. Please redress our grievances.”

“Chu Feng, how are you going to explain this matter/”

The elders of the Gongsun Clan also began glaring at Chu Feng as they demanded an explanation haughtily.

“Hah! You can’t defeat me using proper means, so you decided to resort to trickery, huh? The seven of you tried to steal our treasures and killed us. Had it not been for Chu Feng stepping in to save us, we would have lost our lives in there! We haven’t even said anything about you using the Summoned Jadehearts to control the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace’s power, and yet, you’re already trying to bite down on us?” Xia Yan sneered coldly.

She unhesitatingly retorted against the claims and blurted out the matter concerning the Summoned Jadehearts.

“Summoned Jadehearts?”

As expected, the expressions of the crowd immediately changed upon hearing the term, ‘Summoned Jadehearts’.

Even the Wretched Black Demon turned to look at the Gongsun Clan with narrowed eyes.

The matter concerning the Summoned Jadehearts wasn’t a secret in the Nine Souls Galaxy.

If the Gongsun Clan had really used despicable means to monopolize the Summoned Jadehearts, it would mean that they had deceived not just the Zhuge Clan but also some of the renowned world spiritists who had helped to open the remnant back then too.

And most importantly of all, they had deceived the Nine Souls Sacred Clan too.

If this matter was true, the Gongsun Clan could very well face the threat of extinction.

“You lass, what nonsense are you spouting? How could our Gongsun Clan possibly have Summoned Jadehearts? If you dare run your mouth again, I’ll tear your mouth off!”

Those from the Gongsun Clan immediately refuted Xia Yan’s claims vehemently, throwing out threats at her to shut her mouth. Some of them even released their oppressive might.

From the looks of it, it seemed like they would really go to all lengths as long as they could silence Xia Yan’s mouth.

“What are you doing? Does my presence mean nothing to you anymore?”

A bellow immediately silenced the members of the Gongsun Clan, and they hurriedly retracted their oppressive might.

Naturally, the one who spoke was no other than the Wretched Black Demon.

The Wretched Black Demon might have kept up an amicable front thus far, but one would have to be foolish to think that he was really good-hearted. The ‘Demon’ in his title didn’t just spout out of nowhere.

He was a vicious and domineering man at his core.

In the Nine Souls Galaxy, there were very few people who would dare to snub the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

But the Wretched Black Demon was one of them.

“Young friend Chu Feng, why aren’t you saying anything? Aren’t you going to give a reasonable explanation to their accusations?”

After curbing the Gongsun Clan, the Wretched Black Demon turned his gaze to Chu Feng.

“Milord, I believe that you already have a good idea what’s going on. It’s true that I have made a move on the Gongsun Clan, but that’s because they attempted to steal my treasures. I could have killed them if I wanted to, but those two are still alive and kicking right now. That should be more than enough to prove that I have shown mercy on them and magnanimously let them off the hook.

“Milord, if you harbor doubts regarding what I have just said, my brothers, Xia Yan and Xiao Yu, can testify for me,” Chu Feng said.

“You want those two to testify for you? They are your allies! Can we even trust them?” a prodigy of the Gongsun Clan replied disdainfully.

“Just as what you have said, how can I trust the words of the seven of you then?”

The Wretched Black Demon turned to the seven prodigies of the Gongsun Clan and asked.

“Milord, we...”

That question stumped the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.

Indeed, compared to Chu Feng, Xia Yan, and Xiao Yu, who had just made an alliance with one another out of necessity to tide through this trial, the seven of them were even closer with one another. They were blood-related, coming from the same clan.

“It’d be hard to verify what truly happened in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, so I shan’t pursue it anymore. Thus, you need not speak anything else about it. However, I should make it clear here that I particularly look down on those who dare not admit to what they have done and attempt to sabotage others after suffering a defeat.”

The words of the Wretched Black Demon were obviously directed toward the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, and it left the faces of the latter reddening in embarrassment.

“According to the rules of the marriage convention, the first five challengers to leave the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace will be moving on to the next round.

“Different from the earlier trials, in this round, you’ll be tested on your ability to battle as a world spiritist. You are disallowed from using your martial power, but any means relating to formations and spirit power are permitted. The strongest two amongst the five will be moving on to the final trial.”

The Wretched Black Demon kept the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace back into his sleeves as he explained the rules of the next round. Following that, he flicked his wrist lightly, and another black object shot out from his sleeves.

The object swiftly flew toward the center of the square before expanding rapidly.

But amazingly, along with the expansion of the object, the entire spectator stand began expanding as well. In an instant, the entire area was enlarged to the size of a mini continent. Its size was so large that those standing within looked no more than specks of dust.
