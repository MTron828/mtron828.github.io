Chapter 4303: Three Months Later

“Do we really have to stay here for three months before we’ll be let out?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right, young master Chu Feng. I’ve been here many times, and it takes three months every single time,” Wang Yuxian replied.

“Alright, I understand. Where should we head to now? Chu Feng asked.

Even though they had three months in here, Chu Feng didn’t plan to waste any time here. He wanted to clear this trial as soon as possible.

“I’m counting on young master Chu Feng to find it for me. Even though I have been here for quite a few times, I haven’t been able to find the destination to date. That’s why I deduced that there might be a need to rely on spirit power in order to get there.

“I tried bringing different treasures in here to help me, but none of them worked. After all, a trial should be cleared with one’s own power. It’s normal for treasures would be rendered ineffective on trial grounds,” Wang Yuxian replied.

“I see. I know what to do.”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng quickly rose to the sky and used his Heaven’s Eyes to scan the area.

After searching for a moment, Chu Feng spoke with his eyes fixated on the south, “Found it.”

“So fast?”

Wang Yuxian was slightly skeptical to hear those words from Chu Feng.

As someone who had been here many times and had tried all sorts of means to find the destination, she found it hard to believe that Chu Feng was able to find it so quickly.

If this was really true, it would appear that she was really useless.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Miss Wang, follow me.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he began heading in the direction where he was looking at earlier.

Wang Yuxian followed him closely.

The area where Chu Feng was headed to was a lake.

He stopped above the lake, and without any hesitation, he released his spirit power and began constructing a formation. As soon as the formation descended upon the lake, its peaceful surface began to turn wild.

Swoosh!

A massive wave rose up to the sky with incredible momentum. It was no ordinary wave, and the power it harnessed was even more extraordinary.

As the wave crashed down on Chu Feng, he was knocked back for several thousand meters before he finally managed to regain his footing.

However, Chu Feng didn’t have the time to let his thoughts wander. His attention was entirely focused on controlling the energy within the formation he had constructed.

Soon, a whirlpool began to appear at the center of the lake. It was growing larger and larger, and soon, it covered the entire lake.

At the center of the whirlpool happened to be a spirit formation gate.

“It really appeared. I didn’t think that it would be here... Young master Chu Feng, you are really incredible!”

Wang Yuxian turned to Chu Feng in agitation, hoping to thank him. However, when she saw him, she couldn’t help but freeze in place.

“Young master Chu Feng, you...”

As it turned out, Chu Feng was completely caught off-guard by the earlier wave that the mask on his face ended up getting struck off when the powerful wave crashed down on him earlier, revealing his wrecked face.

It was just a moment ago that Chu Feng was doing fine, so why would he turn into such a state all of a sudden?

In the end, Chu Feng was wearing a mask not to deceive the trial but to deceive her. He simply didn’t want her to see his true face!

“Put this aside for the moment. I need to control the formation till you come out safely, or else you’ll be trapped within. You need to hurry up and enter. If you find yourself unable to clear the trial, you should head out right away,” Chu Feng said.

“But...”

Wang Yuxian was a little hesitant to head in straight away. In her eyes, there was a trace of guilt.

She was a very smart person, so she was able to figure out right away the reason behind Chu Feng’s disfigurement.

However, she knew what her priorities were, so she didn’t hesitate for too long before entering the spirit formation gate.

Roughly six hours later, Chu Feng could sense some changes occurring with the formation. The lake had begun to calm down, but the spirit formation gate was still there.

From this, he could tell that the trial had come to an end. Wang Yuxian had succeeded.

She was indeed a highly talented individual. While she wasn’t skilled in spirit formations, her talent in martial cultivation was really at a frightening level.

And as expected, Wang Yuxian soon reappeared from the spirit formation gate.

Even though she didn’t exert her cultivation after she appeared once more, Chu Feng could sense some changes in her aura. Most likely, she had managed to advance her cultivation a step further yet again.

However, the greatest benefit she gained from clearing the trial wasn’t the advancement in her cultivation but the enhancement in her bloodline.

“You managed to clear it within just six hours? As expected of Miss Wang,” Chu Feng remarked with a smile.

“Young master Chu Feng, you’re flattering me.”

Wang Yuxian was initially still overjoyed by her success, but when she saw Chu Feng once more, her face swiftly turned grave.

“It should be a cause for celebration. Why do you look so depressed?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“Young master Chu Feng, I hope that you can tell me the truth. Did you turn into this state in order to help me?” Wang Yuxian asked.

In the end, she simply couldn’t get over the matter just like that.

“Yes, you’re right. However, I did it on my own volition. As long as I helped you, your master would do me a huge favor in return. So, Miss Wang, you need not feel burdened by this. I have no regrets about this,” Chu Feng said.

Wang Yuxian didn’t say anything else about that. However, there was a musing look in her eyes when she looked at Chu Feng.

...

Time passed in a flash. Three months had passed since Chu Feng entered this area.

At this very moment, Chu Feng was seated at the peak of a mountain with his eyes closed, focused on his cultivation.

“Chu Feng.”

All of a sudden, a pleasing voice sounded from afar, and an item suddenly whizzed across the sky in his direction.

Chu Feng raised his hand and caught the item. It was a fruit.

He turned his gaze toward the sky and saw Wang Yuxian standing in midair. She was holding onto a bundle of fruits with one hand while taking large mouthfuls off a fruit she was holding in the other.

The juices of the fruit splashed all over her snowy white face, all the way up to her forehead.

It was a very different side to the usual, nonchalant Wang Yuxian.

“Lele, if I hadn’t seen it for myself, I wouldn’t have believed that you were such a glutton,” Chu Feng remarked as he started munching on the fruit in his hand too.

“We’re leaving today, so it goes without saying that I should get a few more. You won’t be able to get anymore in the future, you know!”

As Wang Yuxian spoke, she took out a Cosmos Sack and tossed all of the fruits into it. After that, she threw it over to Chu Feng.

Out of curiosity, Chu Feng took a peek into it, and to his shock, there was literally a mountain of fruits inside. It was at least tens of thousands of times more than what Wang Yuxian had in her hands earlier.

There must be at least several hundred thousand fruits inside the Cosmos Sack!

“I must say, Lele, have you gone mad? Did you harvest all of the fruits in here?” Chu Feng asked.

“The fruits here can restore your appearance, so it goes without saying that I should harvest more of them. I have no intention of owing you that big of a favor,” Wang Yuxian replied with a pout.

Many things had occurred over the past three months.

First and foremost, there had been a huge change in the relationship between Wang Yuxian and Chu Feng.

Over this period of time—god knows what in the world had ended up moving her—Wang Yuxian ended up putting aside her mask and showing her true self to Chu Feng.

And her true self was actually a lively and mischievous lass.

Based on Wang Yuxian’s words, she had only shown this side of her to three people. One was her master, and one was Chu Feng.

As for the last person, Wang Yuxian simply refused to tell Chu Feng who he or she was.
