Chapter 3983 - Dragon Mark Saint-cloak

“Arrogant fellow, today, this old man will teach you a lesson!”

Lu Yingzhuo gnashed his teeth furiously. He was so furious that even his heart was trembling.

No matter what, he was a Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect.

Even though he was bowing and bending his knees to the six leaders earlier, he would always act very high and mighty towards others.

Thus, it was only natural that he was unable to tolerate Chu Feng’s disdain.

Because of that, everyone could tell that he was planning to get serious.

In fact, even his Dark Ghostflame changed.

The enormous shadow that stood in midair began to collapse.

Although the shadowy figure had crumbled, the black gaseous flames that had created it were still there.

Everyone could tell that Lu Yingzhuo was likely going to unleash something even more powerful.

Sure enough, the black gaseous flames began to gather once more.

They began to coil around as they surged forth and formed an enormous python.

The python was several tens of thousands of meters long. As it spiraled in midair, even the clouds appeared small.

It was truly a huge monster!

Like a black tornado with devastating power, the huge spiraling monster rushed towards Chu Feng.

Before the attack had even arrived, the ground was already shattering. One could very well imagine how powerful of an attack it was.

Because of that, Lu Yingzhuo’s attack caused both excitement and nervousness to many people from the All-heaven Sect. They were so tense that they all began to tightly clench their fists.

They all knew that the attack Lu Yingzhuo was using was his strongest attack.

If that attack still failed to defeat that guy, Lu Yingzhuo would likely not be able to handle him.

“Boom~~~”

Black smoke filled the sky and the surroundings.

The earth had been turned into countless enormous and deep holes.

Surging thick smoke rushed straight into the sky, covering it, and turning the surroundings dusky and dark.

Before the crowd’s gazes, the Dark Ghostflame successfully landed on Chu Feng.

However, after the Dark Ghostflame started dissipating, the crowd were astonished to discover that Chu Feng was still standing there, completely unharmed.

Furthermore, an even more astonishing scene occurred.

Earlier, the crowd were all uncertain as to what sort of ability Chu Feng had used to defend against Lu Yingzhuo’s attacks.

They were also uncertain of his actual cultivation.

Yet at that moment, Chu Feng had finally unleashed his aura.

However, that aura was actually the same as before. It was still that of a rank eight Exalted.

Chu Feng had defended against the attacks of a rank one Utmost Exalted as a rank eight Exalted?!

“You, exactly what are you?”

Lu Yingzhuo stepped back repeatedly in terror.

As matters stood, he already knew that it would be very difficult for him to defeat the man before him with his own strength.

However, what brought him the greatest despair was that his opponent had actually managed to defend against his attacks as a rank eight Exalted.

Because of this, he felt that what stood before him could very possibly not be a human, but rather a monster.

Right, he must be a monster.

Only monsters could do something so unconventional, so unreasonable.

In fact, it was not only Lu Yingzhuo who was terrified. The others present were also terrified of Chu Feng.

“That guy, exactly who is he?”

“No, that’s impossible. It’s impossible that he’s a rank eight Exalted.”

“He must’ve used some other sort of power to block that attack.”

“Treasure. It must be a treasure. I’ve heard that the Mystic Cave Saints have numerous rare treasures that have special powers.”

“Right, it must be the treasures.”

After a brief period of terror, the crowd began to make guesses as to how Chu Feng had blocked Lu Yingzhuo’s attacks.

In the end, they settled on one possible explanation -- Chu Feng had used treasures to block all of Lu Yingzhuo’s attacks..

Soon, that opinion gained the acknowledgement of everyone.

After all, even the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster had declared that the Mystic Cave Saints possessed numerous treasures with special powers.

They were able to sneak their way into a spirit formation world that not even the six great powers were able to do anything about. As such, it was no surprise that they would possess treasures capable of blocking Lu Yingzhuo’s attacks.

After all, Lu Yingzhuo’s actual cultivation had been restricted. He was only able to unleash the power of a rank one Utmost Exalted.

“Mystic Cave Saints, your reputations are truly well-deserved.”

Suddenly, Lu Yingzhuo let out a cold laugh.

Although he was unable to hear the discussions outside, he, after being momentarily astonished, arrived at the same conclusion as the people outside.

He felt that the reason why the person before him was able to block his attacks was most definitely through the usage of some sort of treasure’s power.

“You can continue staying here. This old man is taking this set of armor.”

After determining that Chu Feng had relied on a treasure’s power, Lu Yingzhuo stopped panicking.

After all, the powers of treasures generally had very special attributes.

Since it was a treasure capable of blocking attacks, it should not possess any destructive power.

Thus, he felt that Chu Feng was only able to block his attacks, and could not harm him.

He felt that it might be possible for Chu Feng’s actual cultivation to only be that of a rank eight Exalted.

Otherwise, he would not be bluffing like that, he would not be merely defending and not attacking.

When this thought crossed his mind, even though his attacks had clearly been blocked by Chu Feng, he was not only not panicking, but he instead began to look down on Chu Feng.

Because of that, he decided to pay no attention to him, and instead began walking towards the set of armor that he had thoroughly harmonized earlier.

“Wuuahhh~~~”

However, right after he extended his hand, before he could even touch the armor, he let out a scream.

The reason for that was because he was suddenly struck by an enormous power the instant he extended his hand.

Not only was he sent flying, but even his bones were shattered in the process.

Dust rose continuously into the sky. Lu Yingzhuo rolled on the ground for tens of thousands of meters before finally stabilizing himself.

He not only vomited blood, but his entire body was covered in blood.

That one strike had caused him great injuries.

“You!”

Being attacked, Lu Yingzhuo subconsciously looked to Chu Feng.

Upon doing so, his expression changed completely. The expressions of the crowd outside also changed.

A power visible to the naked eye was being emitted from Chu Feng’s body.

It was not martial power. Rather, it was spirit power.

Many dragons were galloping through that power. The light emitted by it was very sacred.

That was... Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spirit Power!

“He... he’s actually a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?!”

“He... he turned out to actually be a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?!”

Cries of alarm sounded nonstop.

The expressions of the crowd all became marvelous.

They suddenly recalled the words spoken by Grandmaster Feng You.

‘Only Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists could ignore the spirit formation beneath the purple pillars of light.’

They had originally thought the words spoken by Grandmaster Feng You to be a possibility that would never come true.

They were certain that Chu Feng was able to ignore those protective formations because he was using some sort of treasure.

It was only at that moment that they realized that Chu Feng had never relied on any treasure.

Instead, Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, and possessed the power to ignore the protective formations.
