Chapter 3985 - Strange Cage

“Damn it!”

Just when the majority of the crowd were exclaiming in admiration, the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster and others were frowning.

They had believed that Lu Yingzhuo was their final hope.

However, even their final hope was unable to contend against Chu Feng.

Because of this, they became very restless.

However, the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster did not despair completely. Instead, he still had a trace of hope.

Even though Lu Yingzhuo was in such a tragic state, the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster still had a trace of hope for him.

“All-heaven Sect, look at what you all have caused.”

Suddenly, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster looked to the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster with an angry expression.

“Why does this have anything to do with me?” the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster asked with a stern voice.

“If you hadn’t provoked those Mystic Cave Saints, how could the scene before us occur?”

“If you all hadn’t provoked the Mystic Cave Saints, why would they attempt to plunder our treasure?” the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster asked.

“You are simply foolish to the extreme, simply unreasonable beyond belief.”

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster was truly angered by the words spoken by the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster.

After all, when the Mystic Cave Saints had appeared in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb, they’d robbed the inheritance that should belong to their All-heaven Sect.

They, the All-heaven Sect, were the victims. How could it be spoken of as if they were the ones at fault?

“Enough. This is no time for internal strife.”

“Since that elder is no match for that Mystic Cave Saint, we have no choice but to keep a close guard on those spirit formation gates. We cannot allow that guy to escape,” said the Miao Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“The outcome is not yet determined,” said the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

“Oh? Could it be that that elder still has other cards up his sleeve?” the others asked after hearing the words spoken by the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster.

“Just watch carefully and you’ll come to a natural understanding,” said the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster,

Actually, even he himself was uncertain as to whether Lu Yingzhuo’s hidden technique would be able to defeat Chu Feng

Even though he had not fought the Mystic Cave Saints, he had heard about them, and especially that Asura.

He knew that Asura had gained control of the spirit formation, and made it so that even Tuoba Chengan and others could only choose to flee.

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster felt that it was very possible that the person inside the spirit formation world was not a member of the All-heaven Sect, but rather that Asura.

As such, even though he knew that Lu Yingzhuo still had a hidden trump card, he was not absolutely confident.

After all, he was not certain if that Asura fellow had hidden trump cards too.

However, as he knew how powerful the treasure on Lu Yingzhuo was, he still had a certain amount of hope and expectations.

“Damn it!”

Inside the spirit formation world, Lu Yingzhuo was being beaten rolling and crawling on the ground by Chu Feng. His entire body was covered in blood, and he appeared very sorry.

Even he himself knew that Chu Feng was simply toying with him, simply humiliating him.

However, there was nothing he could do. After all, he was truly no match for Chu Feng.

This caused him to feel very unwell. Mainly, it was because he had received an enormous shock to his ego.

However, Lu Yingzhuo did not think that he was definitely screwed.

A look of hesitation appeared in his eyes.

He was hesitant about whether or not he should use his trump card.

Mainly, it was because that trump card could only be used once. That trump card was an invaluable item. Unless absolutely necessary, he would definitely not use it on Chu Feng.

If he were to use his trump card but fail to obtain the desired effect, he himself would feel extremely unwell. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In the end, the hesitation in his eyes disappeared, and was replaced with a look of determination.

In the end, he made the resolve.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, a talisman paper appeared in his hand.

It was a white talisman paper, with black runes and symbols written on it.

The talisman paper was very strange, and emitted a very powerful aura.

Once the talisman paper appeared, Lu Yingzhuo immediately tossed it out.

The talisman paper turned into a ray of light that shot straight for Chu Feng.

The speed of that talisman paper was simply too fast. By the time Chu Feng noticed it, it was already before him.

Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately released his spirit power and formed a spirit formation before him, blocking the talisman paper.

At the same time, he moved backwards to quickly distance himself from it.

The reason why he reacted so cautiously was because he was able to sense that the talisman paper before him contained a great amount of power.

Just in case, Chu Feng had to be cautious.

“Buzz~~~”

Soon, that talisman paper exploded.

After the talisman paper shattered, a semi-transparent body of energy was rapidly released from it.

That body of energy was actually even faster than the talisman paper. Furthermore, it was very weird.

That body of energy completely ignored Chu Feng’s protective formation, and went straight through it.

Furthermore, as that body of energy was simply expanding too quickly, it soon caught up to Chu Feng.

Then, an even stranger scene occurred.

That body of energy actually passed through his body.

However, it did not cause any injuries or affect him in any way.

Chu Feng was completely confused as to exactly what use the body of energy possessed.

He was able to see that the body of energy was spherical.

At that moment, he was trapped inside this sphere.

“Clank~~~”

After the body of energy passed through Chu Feng, an ear-piercing rumble sounded from all around him .

In the next instant, the body of energy turned into a steel-like substance that completely sealed Chu Feng within it.

“This is... a cage formation?!”

Chu Feng finally came to a realization.

That body of energy had transformed.

It was no longer a body of energy capable of passing through everything. Instead, it had materialized into a steel-like object.

Chu Feng was able to tell from a single glance that that steel-like material was extremely tough. A rank one Utmost Exalted would not be able to breach it.

“No, it’s not only a cage formation.”

Soon, Chu Feng’s gaze narrowed with depth.

He suddenly discovered vein lines on the steel-like object that flickered with light.

At the same time, an oppressive sensation enveloped Chu Feng from all directions.

That was not only a cage formation, it was a cage formation capable of killing the people trapped within it!

“No wonder you showed such hesitation earlier. Turns out, you were wondering whether or not to use this trump card.”

Even though Chu Feng had already seen through what was powerful about the cage formation, not only did he not panic, but instead had a smile of seeing through everything.

“What is that?”

Whilst Chu Feng might’ve seen through what the talisman paper’s power was, the people outside were confused by it.

Furthermore, as the talisman paper had been simply too fast, many people didn’t even notice Lu Yingzhou tossing it out.

All they remembered was Chu Feng suppressing Lu Yingzhou when suddenly, an enormous steel fort appeared.

The steel fort just so happened to appear right where Chu Feng was previously, and sealed him off completely.

That’s right, they saw it as a steel fort instead of a cage formation.

As for what use a steel fort possessed, it was something everyone knew -- to protect oneself.
