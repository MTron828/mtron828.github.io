Chapter 5463: Long Muxi and Long Chengyu

“This feeling…”

The World Spiritist Painter suddenly froze in horror. It might look like nothing was happening on the surface, but he could clearly sense that the unfathomable power harnessed by the All Lives Are Equal Palace was swiftly flowing away.

Some time later, everything finally calmed down.

However, the World Spiritist Painter was utterly packed. He could tell that the All Lives Are Equal Palace had lost nearly all of its energy in just a matter of moments, leaving nothing but an empty shell. While it still had many valuable paintings, the crux of the palace was gone.

How could the World Spiritist Painter not panic when the treasure he had been proud of had suddenly lost its core?

He hurriedly scanned his surroundings in hopes of figuring out what had just happened.

But no matter how he examined the All Lives Are Equal Palace, he was unable to determine the cause behind the phenomenon. He sweated profusely, and his breathing became laborious. Strength drained from his body as he fell onto his bum.

“How could this be? What happened? Could it be related to that monster? No, that can’t be. Everything was still in order earlier on,” the World Spiritist Painter muttered. He was on the verge of tears.

He suddenly thought of something and reached into his robe.

That was where he had stored an extremely important painting containing the true secret of the All Lives Are Equal Palace. It was the painting he had shown Chu Feng, and the latter said that he saw a coffin in it.

Now that a disaster had befallen the All Lives Are Equal Palace, he wanted to see if he could figure out anything from the painting. Unfortunately, this course of action only further stoked his panic. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The painting had gone missing without him noticing.

“How could this be?!”

The World Spiritist Painter was horrified. This was a huge blow to him.

The fact that he had lost the painting meant that he would never be able to restore the All Lives Are Equal Palace back to its former glory. He had been abandoned.

…

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was inside an ancient teleportation formation, in the midst of making his way to the Totem Dragon Clan. He was riding a massive dragon boat that traveled much faster than any of his other treasures.

Most treasures that could quickly sail through a teleportation formation tended to be smaller in size, but the dragon boat was both immense and fast. This showed just how wealthy the Totem Dragon Clan was.

It was worth noting that the dragon boat was emanating the aura of the Ancient Era despite carrying the Totem Dragon Clan’s flag. This meant that this treasure was not created by the Totem Dragon Clan but obtained from an ancient remnant.

Thanks to the hulking size of the dragon boat, Chu Feng was able to get his own room as well. He took this opportunity to look through the treasures he had taken from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

“Not bad. I made decent progress,” Eggy suddenly spoke up.

“Eggy, did you make a breakthrough?” Chu Feng asked.

While he was looking through the treasures, Eggy made use of this time to absorb the origin energies he had collected from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. While Eggy needed more cultivation resources in order to make a breakthrough, the sheer amount of origin energies they had collected from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect should be enough for her to advance her cultivation.

“I’ve reached rank two Half-God,” Eggy replied.

“Congratulations, Milady Queen,” Chu Feng replied.

“It’s all thanks to you,” Eggy said. “Did you find anything good?”

“There are a few valuable pills, weapons, formations, and even forbidden medicine, but I didn’t find any special treasures. I’m still trying to crack Jia Lingyi’s Cosmos Sack, which is a bit troublesome because of the powerful seal placed on it. She probably used a formation treasure to construct that seal. However, I should be able to decipher it in due time,” Chu Feng said.

“She went to such an extent to prevent others from accessing her Cosmos Sack? There must be something special in it,” Eggy remarked.

“That’s hard to say. I hope so,” Chu Feng replied. “Hm?”

Chu Feng suddenly sensed someone standing outside his door. Through his senses, he could tell that it was Long Muxi’s aunt, Long Suqing. He quickly rose to his feet and opened the door, and Long Suqing walked straight in without saying a word.

Long Suqing took out a talisman and flicked it. The activated talisman formed an isolation barrier around the room. She then turned to Chu Feng and said, “You have sharp senses, young friend Chu Feng. I didn’t expect you to notice me.”

“Lord Suqing, is there something you need me for?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, there is something I’d like to request from you,” Long Suqing said.

“Please feel free to speak. As long as it isn’t anything that goes against my principles, I’ll do my best to help you,” Chu Feng replied.

Long Suqing chuckled. “What a sly answer that is. You can be assured that I don’t intend to put you in a spot. It’s a matter concerning Muxi.”

“Miss Muxi?” Chu Feng narrowed his eyes.

“Has she told you about her history with Chengyu?” Long Suqing asked.

“She didn’t.” Chu Feng shook his head.

“She didn’t? That sounds just like her,” Long Suqing remarked with a sigh. “You should have noticed by now that Muxi harbors a grudge against the Totem Dragon Clan.”

“I tried asking her about it, but she isn’t willing to speak.”

“I can tell you what it is, but you have to keep it to yourself. Don’t try to verify the details with her.”

“I promise you that I won’t divulge it to others.”

“I trust your character.”

Long Suqing proceeded to fill Chu Feng in on the details that led to Long Muxi distancing herself from the Totem Dragon Clan.

Long Muxi and Long Chengyu were siblings born from the same parents.

Before Long Chengyu’s birth, Long Muxi had already proven herself as a prodigy far surpassing that of her peers and her predecessors. Her parents harbored great expectations for her. Her father even declared that he would pass down the position of clan chief to her in the future.

Everything changed when Long Chengyu was born.

Long Chengyu displayed talent above Long Muxi. It didn’t take long for everyone in the Totem Dragon Clan to become convinced that he would succeed the position of clan chief in the future. In fact, even Long Muxi and Long Chengyu’s father had such an intention in mind too.

In spite of that, Long Muxi was never jealous of her younger brother. Instead, she doted on him a lot and willingly imparted all of her skills and knowledge to him. Naturally, the two siblings grew extremely close to each other.

However, an event later occurred that drove a wedge in their relationship. It led to Long Muxi fracturing ties with not just her father but the entire Totem Dragon Clan.
