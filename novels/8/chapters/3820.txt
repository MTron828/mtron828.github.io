Chapter 3820 - Provocation From The Weak

That person was Yin Zhuanghong. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Upon thinking about it, Chu Feng remembered that Yin Zhuanghong seemed to be someone from the Reincarnation Upper Realm. Thus, it was not surprising to encounter her here.

When Chu Feng arrived, the people of the younger generation present all looked to him.

The great majority of them were sizing him up with hostile or curious looks.

Only Yin Zhuanghong took a single glance at Chu Feng before turning away and returning to do what she was doing.

“It would appear that that girl’s eyes are not that powerful either. At least, my disguise worked on her.”

Chu Feng felt secretly delighted upon seeing that Yin Zhuanghong had not managed to recognize him.

Yin Zhuanghong’s eyes were very special. They were extremely perceptive.

The perceptiveness of her eyes surpassed even Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes.

For Chu Feng’s disguise to fool Yin Zhuanghong, it meant that he had disguised himself very well. This caused him to feel somewhat proud of himself.

“Lord White Gown, who is that person?”

At that moment, a fair-skinned and womanly-looking man walked over.

Chu Feng noticed that this man was one of the people who had looked at him with hostility.

However, his attitude when he questioned Lord White Gown was extremely courteous. Even the gaze with which he looked at Chu Feng had turned very good-natured.

Hypocrite. This was the first impression Chu Feng had of the man.

“This young friend is named Asura. He was also invited over by Lord Yuan Shu," said Lord White Gown.

“So it’s actually brother Asura. I am Li Xiao, it is my pleasure to meet you." That man greeted Chu Feng with a clasped fist.

As the saying went, one should not beat up someone smiling and acting courteous towards oneself. Regardless of what sort of person the man might be, Chu Feng must still respond with courtesy toward him, at least for the time being. Thus, Chu Feng also returned his greeting respectfully.

Afterwards, many other people also came to greet Chu Feng.

The great majority of them only greeted him out of courtesy, pretending to show their manners before Lord White Gown.

What surprised Chu Feng was that there were indeed people among them that greeted him with sincerity. This meant that the people of the younger generation gathered here were not all arrogant and conceited hypocrites.

“Young friends, this old man will not disturb you anymore.”

Seeing that those people were getting along with Chu Feng, Lord White Gown decided to leave.

He formed hand seals single-handedly, and then the talisman he held in his hand started to circulate with light. With that, he disappeared from the palace hall.

Lord White Gown had left with great ease.

Of course he had left at ease. After all, he knew that Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

“Asura, why is that your name?”

Right after Lord White Gown left, the gaze Li Xiao looked to Chu Feng with changed.

When they’d been chatting earlier, he had a good-natured gaze. However at that moment, his gaze had become extremely provocative.

Chu Feng had guessed correctly. That guy was indeed a hypocrite.

Seeing that Li Xiao’s attitude was extremely bad, Chu Feng’s attitude also dropped by a thousand feet. “What business does my name have to do with you?”

“Oh-ho. What an arrogant tone. Do you know who I am? You dare to speak with me in such a manner?”

“Besides, the invitation date that Lord Yuan Shu arranged was clearly yesterday. Why did you only arrive now?” Li Xiao asked with a stern voice.

“I was delayed," said Chu Feng.

“Delayed? What a great ‘delayed.’ Do you know that we all arrived yesterday? It’s because we were waiting for you that we ended up wasting an entire day here.”

“Say, how are you going to settle this debt?”

Li Xiao’s voice became more and more ear-piercing. His attitude became more and more vile. Sure enough, he intended to make trouble for Chu Feng.

What brought the greatest displeasure to Chu Feng was that Li Xiao was not the only one who intended to cause trouble for him. Many others were also lashing out at him.

They all felt that they’d waited for so long because of him.

However, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance after arriving at that palace that it was a grand formation.

Apart from Lord White Gown, who was able to use that special talisman to come and go at will, they, the people of the younger generation gathered there, would have to breach the grand formation should they intend to leave the palace.

However, the grand formation was rather complicated. One could not act recklessly when attempting to breach it. Instead, one must examine it carefully.

Chu Feng checked his surroundings. The people of the younger generation gathered in that palace, not counting himself, numbered a total of twenty-seven.

Of those twenty-seven, only two people were actually examining the palace’s walls.

One of them was Yin Zhuanghong.

Chu Feng knew how capable Yin Zhuanghong was. That girl’s eyes were very powerful. Likely, she had found clues the moment she entered the palace. That was why she’d been searching for the method to breach it.

As for the other individual, it was a man.

That man was immaculately dressed, and very handsome.

Most amazing of all, even Chu Feng was unable to see through his cultivation.

However, that didn’t mean that his cultivation surpassed Chu Feng’s. Likely, he possessed some sort of treasure that could conceal his cultivation.

Although Chu Feng was unable to see through the man’s cultivation, Chu Feng was able to detect powerful spirit power from his gaze.

Chu Feng could tell that, among the crowd of younger generations present, that man’s world spirit techniques were considerably decent.

He... was an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

Although his world spirit techniques were far inferior to Chu Feng’s, they were outstanding compared to the others present.

After all, the other twenty-five other people of the younger generation had not yet discovered the fact that they needed to breach the spirit formation in order to leave.

Otherwise, they would not have blamed Chu Feng for their failure.

“Hey! I’m talking to you! Are you deaf?!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was Li Xiao.

His clothes fluttered, and his oppressive might spread forth.

He possessed the cultivation of a rank seven Martial Immortal. As a person of the younger generation, being able to possess such a cultivation was considerably decent. Unfortunately, the person he was provoking was Chu Feng.

“You’re actually blaming me for your own stupidity?” Chu Feng looked at Li Xiao like he was looking at a fool.

“You dare call me stupid?! I see that you’ve grown tired of living!”

Li Xiao was immediately enraged by Chu Feng’s words. As he spoke, he began to walk towards Chu Feng.

“Rumble, rumble~”

His footsteps were very powerful. With every step, the palace hall trembled violently. It appeared as if it would be crushed under his feet. It was very imposing.

At that moment, many bystanders revealed smiles and looks of delight as they watched what they believed to be Chu Feng’s calamity.

They were already displeased at being stuck there for an entire day. Thus, they wanted to vent their displeasure on Chu Feng.

They all wanted to witness Li Xiao ruthlessly beating up Chu Feng.

However, what they didn’t know was that Chu Feng not only showed no trace of fear toward the aggressive Li Xiao, but he even felt slight pity for him.

Should Li Xiao dare to attack him, Chu Feng would make him realize what was meant by ‘there are more heavens to the sky, and there are stronger people then the individual.’

“Woosh~”

Right at the moment when Li Xiao approached Chu Feng and was about to attack him, a figure suddenly appeared in between Li Xiao and Chu Feng.
