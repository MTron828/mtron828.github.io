Chapter 4771: Punishment!

“Rise.”

The sectmaster gestured to him to rise to his feet before turning around to head back to her residence. Her footsteps were elegant, but her speed was definitely not something to make light of. Li Fengxian had to give it his all in order to barely catch up with her.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already returned back to the gazebo where Chu Feng was waiting earlier. However, instead of entering the gazebo, the sectmaster descended onto the roof of the gazebo before gazing contemplatively at the sky veiled with calamitous dark clouds.

“Lord Sectmaster, I’ve long told you that Chu Feng is a prodigy, and I’ve been wanting to bring him into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for a long time now. It looks like my evaluation of him was truly spot-on. He’s a true prodigy. Our sect has really picked up a treasure this time around.

“Now that I think about it, we really have to thank Duan Liufeng. If not for him...”

Li Fengxian was just about to get into talking about Chu Feng’s feat when the sectmaster suddenly raised her hand, indicating for Li Fengxian to hold his tongue.

“I’ve heard what you’ve said earlier,” the sectmaster replied placidly.

Upon seeing this, Li Fengxian’s joyful face started turning a little tense.

It should have been impossible for anyone to remain calm after hearing of Chu Feng’s feat, so there was clearly something amiss with the sectmaster’s reaction.

“Lord Sectmaster, could it be that Chu Feng has been lying?” Li Fengxian asked carefully.

“Dugu Lingtian told me back then that there’s a key that governs the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake’s formation. Anyone who manages to grasp it will be able to tap into the formation’s power. It’s just that he was a little lacking to claim that key,” the sectmaster said.

“If that’s the case, that would mean to say that Chu Feng’s story is true?” Li Fengxian remarked with a gleeful smile.

“He has indeed managed to grasp control over the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake’s formation, and it’s true that there has been an abnormality with the Vicious Beast Hellworld too. However, we still need further investigation to determine whether everything he mentioned is true,” the sectmaster said.

“Regardless, Chu Feng has already proved his talent. He has managed to break Lord Dugu Lingtian’s record and achieve what he wasn’t able to do. He’ll be able to take over Lord Dugu Lingtian’s legacy and...”

Li Fengxian was in the midst of complimenting Chu Feng when the sectmaster suddenly turned her head over to eye Li Fengxian coldly, saying, “There’s no one who can replace Dugu Lingtian.”

Li Fengxian immediately explained, “Lord Sectmaster, I’ve no intention of making light of Lord Dugu Lingtian. I just think that it’s rare to come by someone of Chu Feng’s talent, and I believe that our sect should...” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Are you trying to tell me what to do here?” the sectmaster asked.

“I dare not to.” Li Fengxian hurriedly lowered his head.

“I’m glad that you still remember whose words truly count in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. I want you to knock on the sect’s Dragon Bell later on and relay my orders to all of the elders and disciples. Chu Feng has infringed on the rules of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect by engaging in an act of insubordination. In my capacity as the sectmaster, I’ll sentence him to three days imprisonment on the eleventh level of the Hidden Dragon Prison,” the sectmaster said.

“Three days imprisonment on the eleventh level? Lord Sectmaster, Chu Feng is still only at Utmost Exalted level! Isn’t this punishment a little too harsh for him? I’ve already checked the daoist robe, and Protector Qi did tamper with it.

“Protector Qi was the one who tried to harm Chu Feng first, and Chu Feng only used the power of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake to restrict his movements. His actions can be justified as self-defense!”

Li Fengxian tried to speak up for Chu Feng despite knowing that he could incur the sectmaster’s rage.

There were eighteen levels to the Hidden Dragon Prison, but the first ten levels were already severe punishments. Even the first level would be hard for any disciple to bear, and the horrors only grew with each increasing level.

It was a place feared by everyone in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

The eleventh level of the Hidden Dragon Prison was more than enough to kill someone of Chu Feng’s level. In fact, countless people had already died on the eleventh level, and those who survived the ordeal were either crippled or lost their minds.

Li Fengxian was afraid that Chu Feng wouldn’t be able to walk out alive from this punishment.

“You have an objection with my verdict?” the sectmaster asked.

“I dare not to disobey your orders, but...”

Li Fengxian still wanted to speak up for Chu Feng, but before he could finish his piece, the sectmaster had already interjected right in.

“Just do as you’re told to. I’ll get someone else instead if you aren’t willing to do it.”

“I’ll carry out your orders right now.”

Li Fengxian had no choice but to obey the sectmaster’s orders. He knew that the sectmaster was the king of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and a subordinate like him didn’t have the right to reject her.

“Lord Sectmaster, pardon me for asking, but how do you intend to deal with Protector Qi?” Li Fengxian asked.

“Protector Qi will be punished for his crimes, but in view of his previous contribution to the sect, I’ll temporarily strip him of his position as a protector and have him reflect on his actions in my prison,” the sectmaster replied.

“This...”

Li Fengxian’s face crumbled upon hearing those words.

The fact that Protector Qi was only temporarily stripped of his position meant that it was only a matter of time before he was reinstated. On top of that, the sectmaster’s prison accorded fairly decent treatment.

It looked more like a way for Protector Qi to temporarily seek refuge so as to bail him out from the severe consequences of his vile actions.

It was true that Protector Qi had contributed significantly to the sect in his years of duty, so it would be fair to spare him from death. But still, such a punishment was simply far too biased. It was unfair to Chu Feng.

While there were many injustices going on in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect every day, any crimes that were indicted before the sectmaster would usually be harshly punished. The sectmaster’s attitude toward this matter was completely baffling to Li Fengxian.

“Lord Sectmaster, isn’t this... a little too lenient?”

Li Fengxian eventually decided to voice his thoughts.

“Li Fengxian, it looks like you’re getting bolder with time. You seem to be displeased with my decision? Shall I step down and allow you to manage the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect instead?”

Despite the sectmaster’s impassive voice, Li Fengxian felt cold sweat trickling down his back. He hurriedly kneeled onto the floor.

“I-I-I dare not to! Please forgive me!”

No one else in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect would dare believe that someone of Li Fengxian’s caliber would actually get so nervous as to start stuttering.

“You may rise. Also... it wasn’t easy for your relationship with Nangong Chunyue to improve a little, so make sure that you don’t undo your efforts. If you allow your personal feelings to foil our plans, both of you will be severely punished,” the sectmaster said.

“I understand,” Li Fengxian replied with a nod.

He knew the implied meaning behind the sectmaster’s words.

Regardless of the situation, he mustn’t fall out with Nangong Chunyue. In other words, he shouldn’t interfere at all if Nangong Chunyue intended to make a move against Chu Feng.

“You may leave now.”

The sectmaster’s voice reverberated in the surroundings, but she was already nowhere to be seen.

Li Fengxian rose back to his feet and sighed in a mixture of helplessness and confusion.

He thought that Chu Feng’s accomplishment would win him the sectmaster’s appreciation, who would then grant him the highest privileges amongst the disciples. Yet, things went in the opposite direction instead.

Not only was Chu Feng’s accomplishment unappreciated, but he was even severely punished for no reason too.

Li Fengxian couldn’t understand the rationale behind the sectmaster’s decision at all, but he quickly rose to the air and headed toward the Dragon Bell anyway.

He simply dared not to defy the sectmaster’s will.
