Chapter 2426 - The First Manifestation Of Might

“There’s actually such a powerful Demon Armament in this world? This is simply many times more powerful than even Ancestral Armaments. Chu Feng is actually able to use such a powerful Demon Armament?”

“Chu Feng... exactly what is his origin?”

As the crowd praised in admiration, they began to ponder Chu Feng’s origin again.

“Chu Feng, are you alright?”

Compared to the overwhelming might emitted by the Evil God Sword, Her Lady Queen was more concerned about Chu Feng’s safety.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had officially unleashed the power of the Evil God Sword.

“For the time being, this sword has yet to go out of control. It has given its power to me, allowing me to use it.”

“I now have a rough sensation of its power. If my guess is correct, I will be able to contend against True Immortals as long as I have it,” Chu Feng grew excited.

“Really? Then quickly activate your Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings to increase your cultivation so that you can kill those Kong Heavenly Clan’s old farts,” Her Lady Queen said.

“No. right now, I have only obtained the strength of the Evil God Sword, and my cultivation isn’t really at the True Immortal realm.”

“Furthermore, not only am I unable to use the Heavenly Bloodline’s power, I am also unable to use my martial power to unleash my martial skills and secret skills.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng looked at the Evil God Sword he held in his hands, he said, “Right now, this sword is the only thing that I can use.”

“The Evil God Sword is the only thing you can use?” Her Lady Queen revealed an astonished expression.

“However, I feel... that this sword by itself is sufficient.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng pointed the Evil God Sword in his hand toward one of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders.

“Roar~~~”

At that moment, a strange and ear-piercing voice sounded. Then, a crimson sword ray was shot directly toward that Utmost Exalted Elder.

“This aura, damn it!”

Faced with the sword ray unleashed by the Evil God Sword, that Utmost Exalted Elder revealed a panic-stricken expression. He simply did not even dare to block the attack. Rather, he immediately moved aside to dodge it.

However, Chu Feng did not give up just like that. He continued to brandish his Evil God Sword, and unleashed several sword rays toward that Utmost Exalted Elder.

“Damn!”

In Such a situation, that Utmost Exalted Elder could only try to dodge continuously.

It was not that he did not want to fight back. Rather, Chu Feng’s attacks were simply too fast.

Furthermore, it wasn’t that he didn’t want to block the attacks. Rather, the crimson sword rays emitted by the Evil God Sword were simply too frightening.

Those sword rays brought that Utmost Exalted Elder a sensation, that... he was simply unable to block them.

Thus, he naturally did not dare to block them.

In merely a blink of an eye, that Utmost Exalted Elder was forced many thousands of meters away by Chu Feng. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As for Chu Feng, he did not continue to chase after that Utmost Exalted Elder. Rather, he arrived beside Kong Shunlian.

“Little friend Chu Feng, that sword of yours!!!” Kong Shunlian was also astonished by Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword.

“Senior Kong, I will tell you about the origins of this sword in detail in the future.”

“Right now, we must get through this crisis first. As you’re already injured, you should not battle anymore. Leave with Wang Qiang first, I’ll handle them,” Chu Feng said.

“......”

Hearing those words, Kong Shunlian revealed a surprised expression.

However, Chu Feng completely disregarded Kong Shunlian’s expression.

Instead, Chu Feng looked at the mysterious individual and said, “Senior, I do not know who you are. However, this Chu Feng is truly thankful that you have placed your life on the line to come to my assistance.”

“Might you be willing to leave me your distinguished name? If this Chu Feng is able to live past today, I will definitely repay senior’s kindness today.”

“Young Master Chu Feng, this old man is your servant,” That mysterious individual said.

“Servant?” The response from that mysterious individual came like a sudden clap of thunder in the hearts of all the crowd present.

“Servant? That unknown True Immortal actually declared himself to be Chu Feng’s servant?!”

“Heavens, a True Immortal-level expert is actually Chu Feng’s servant?! Sure enough, Chu Feng possesses an extraordinary origin, a truly extraordinary origin!”

The word ‘servant’ was caught by Zhuge Mingren. He immediately cried out in alarm.

Once he muttered those words, the rest of the bystanders all heard it too.

“True Immortal servant?! Chu Feng’s servant is a True Immortal?! Heavens! Chu Feng not only possesses such a powerful Demon Armament, what sort of huge monster does Chu Feng have behind his back too?!”

“He is most definitely not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He must be a Young Master from a certain Upper Realm.”

“Haha, Kong Heavenly Clan... oh Kong Heavenly Clan, you all have truly met your match now, no?”

Upon finding out the matter of that True Immortal being Chu Feng’s servant, the crowd was completely astonished. However, they all burst into laughter too.

They were all people standing on Chu Feng’s side. Thus, to them, this news was extremely great.

At that moment, they were all certain that Chu Feng was not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Although there were indeed some hidden True Immortal-level experts in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, they were all proud and arrogant individuals, and would definitely refuse to submit to others as servants.

Thus, merely from one word from that mysterious True Immortal, the crowd was certain that Chu Feng must be someone from an Upper Realm.

As for the Upper Realms’ huge monsters, how could a mere Kong Heavenly Clan possibly contend against them?

At that moment, everyone felt that the Kong Heavenly Clan had kicked an iron plate, that they would definitely suffer enormously in the future.

In fact, even the destruction of their Kong Heavenly Clan was possible.

“Servant?”

In fact, Chu Feng was also very astonished right now. No matter how hard he thought about it, he was unable to think of a True Immortal-level servant.

“Senior, regardless of who you might be, I still thank you for your grace today. However, what happened here today is caused by me, Chu Feng. As such, I truly do not wish to implicate you. Thus... please leave too. You can leave the rest to me.”

“Chu Feng, you...”

Kong Shunlian’s expression grew increasingly shocked. He simply did not dare to believe his own ears.

Chu Feng was actually planning to take on three True Immortals by himself?

“What shameless boasting. Do you really think that you can contend against True Immortals with a mere weapon?”

“I will let you experience exactly how powerful the might of a True Immortal is right now.”

The remaining Utmost Exalted Elder who was fighting against Kong Shunlian grew extremely furious and rushed to attack Chu Feng.

He brandished the Ancestral Armament he held in his hand and shot a slash toward Chu Feng.

That slash was no ordinary attack. Rather, it was a martial skill, an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.

A True Immortal unleashing an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill with an Ancestral Armament, oh how powerful must that be?

It was so frighteningly powerful that even Kong Shunlian, a fellow True Immortal, would not dare be careless toward it. Kong Shunlian raised his Ancestral Armament with the intention of blocking that attack.

However, right at the moment when Kong Shunlian was about to act, Chu Feng suddenly thrust forth his Evil God Sword.

“Roar~~~”

A crimson sword ray was once again shot forth from Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword.

The very next moment, the crimson sword ray collided with the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill unleashed by the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder.

To the crowd’s astonishment, the collision did not end in a loud explosion, nor did it create energy ripples wreaking havoc through the surroundings.

Instead, like a stream assimilating into the sea, it quietly and completely disappeared.

That’s right, it was like a stream assimilating into the sea.

That Utmost Exalted Elder’s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was devoured, devoured by the Evil God Sword’s sword ray.

At that moment, not only did that crimson sword ray not grow weaker, it instead became more powerful than before.

That scene stunned everyone present.

One should know... that the people involved, with the exception of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, were all True Immortals.

When even True Immortals were stunned, one could tell how astonishing what had just happened was.
