Chapter 2967 - The Legendary Ten Souls Pearl

"From a coincidental stroke of luck," Chu Feng said with a smile.

"That stroke of luck of yours arrived too quickly, no? You’ve only just become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist not long ago, yet you’ve already become an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist in the blink of an eye?"

When Chu Lingxi said those words, an expression of envy was fully revealed on her exquisite little face.

It would be strange if she didn’t envy Chu Feng. She, together with Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er, had all become Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists together in the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.

And at present, she was still a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, she felt very content to be able to become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist at her age.

Never would she have ever thought that Chu Feng had become an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist already.

While there was only a difference of a single word between Immortal-cloak and Exalted-cloak, everyone knew how enormous the disparity between the two was.

With Chu Lingxi’s proud personality, how could she not be envious of Chu Feng?

Unable to contain herself, Chu Lingxi asked, "Where did you encounter the opportunity to make your breakthrough to Exalted-cloak?"

"Tell me who pushed you into this trap first," Chu Feng said all of a sudden.

Chu Lingxi was immediately startled upon hearing Chu Feng’s question.

Her reaction confirmed Chu Feng’s guess.

Chu Lingxi was, after all, a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Her cultivation was not weak either. With her perception and strength, it would be impossible for her to fall into such a trap.

However, she did fall into the trap. This could only mean two things.

One, Chu Lingxi had jumped into the trap herself.

Two, someone had deliberately pushed Chu Lingxi into the trap.

With the situation at hand, it was most definitely the latter.

"This matter is unrelated to you."

To Chu Feng’s surprise, Chu Lingxi actually responded a moment after being momentarily startled.

Her response practically confirmed Chu Feng’s guess that someone pushed her into the trap.

However, it seemed that Chu Lingxi was unwilling to tell Chu Feng who that person was.

"I truly couldn’t tell that you, girl, possessed quite a decent character. Even though you’ve been harmed by someone, you’re still unwilling to talk behind their back."

"Not bad, not bad. I now have a whole new level of respect for you," Chu Feng started praising Chu Lingxi. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

"Yoh, so you also know how to flatter someone?" Chu Lingxi rolled her eyes.

"Indeed, I dare to boot-lick. However, I wouldn’t dare to boot-lick you," Chu Feng took a glance at Chu Lingxi’s leg as he said those words.

[1. Flattering/boot-lick in chinese is ’slap horse’s buttocks.’ So Chu Feng is saying ’while I dare to slap a horse’s ass, I wouldn’t dare to slap yours.’]

"You..."

"Pervert."

Chu Lingxi’s calmed face once again turned deep red. Her angry appearance was extremely cute.

While Chu Lingxi was someone who had trained in martial cultivation for some time now, she still maintained her innocence like a young girl.

“How am I a pervert? You were the one to ridicule me, yet you don’t want me to reply? If that were the case, you’d be truly too tyrannical, no?” Chu Feng said.

“Humph, this young lady will not bother to quarrel with a pervert,” Chu Lingxi turned around proudly.

“You’re really not going to tell me who pushed you into the trap?” Chu Feng continued to ask.

However, Chu Lingxi only ignored him.

“That said, even if you don’t tell me, I am still able to guess who it is,” Chu Feng said.

“Is that so?” Once Chu Feng said those words, Chu Lingxi instead grew interested. She asked, “Then tell me, who was it?”

“It was Chu Ruoshi, right?” Chu Feng asked.

Once Chu Feng said those words, Chu Lingxi’s beautiful eyes moved. Evidently, she had not expected Chu Feng to guess this accurately. Then, she said, “Tell me the basis of your guess.”

“You entered first. She entered after you. With her strength, she is capable of catching up to you. However, Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan would not be able to catch up to you.”

“It is not that Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan are weak. Instead, it is that their observational abilities are not strong enough.”

“In a place like this with traps and dangers all over, they would be restricted because their observational abilities are insufficient. Thus, the only person that is capable of pushing you into this trap is Chu Ruoshi,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s actually very simple. It’s not hard to guess at all,” Chu Lingxi raised her face proudly.

“What I want to know is why she did that. What benefit is there for her in doing this?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course there are benefits. Do you know why we decided to enter the Death Gate even though there’s a Life Gate we can take?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“Actually, I have no idea why we needed to enter the Death Gate,” Chu Feng shook his head.

“You don’t know the difference between the Life and Death Gates?” Chu Lingxi asked.

“I don’t,” Chu Feng shrugged his shoulders.

“The Life Gate is very safe. Apart from being a bit difficult to traverse, there are practically no dangers at all.”

“However, those that enter the Life Gate will be restricted to the rankings. Only by quickly exiting the Life Gate will they be able to pass the Sacred Domain Selection. Those that rank toward the end will be eliminated.”

“As for the Death Gate, it is very dangerous. However, as long as one is capable of walking out of the Death Gate, regardless of how long it takes, one will have successfully passed the Sacred Domain Selection,” Chu Lingxi explained.

Hearing till this point, Chu Feng interrupted, “But, with your strengths, you will definitely be the fastest to pass even if you are to enter the Life Gate. Logically, there’s no need for you all to enter the Death Gate. Thus, there is another reason as to why you all decided to enter the Death Gate.”

“There are treasures here. There was a treasure above this trap too.” Chu Lingxi said.

“I understand now. So she attacked you in order to take the treasure,” Chu Feng spread his hands and then said to Her Lady Queen, “My Eggy, you are truly the amazing one. That Chu Ruoshi is indeed not as good and honest as she appeared to be.”

“Of course. This Queen’s intuition is extremely sharp. However, judging by Chu Lingxi’s behavior, it seems that she was not surprised by Chu Ruoshi attacking her. It would appear that she already knew what sort of character Chu Lingxi had,” Her Lady Queen said.

“Mn, speaking of Chu Lingxi, I feel that she is a pretty decent girl the more I get to know her. Even though Chu Ruoshi harmed her, she did not say anything bad about Chu Ruoshi at all,” Chu Feng said.

“Indeed, she’s pretty decent. How about you take her as your wife?” Her Lady Queen said with a mischievous smile.

Hearing those words, black lines rolled down Chu Feng’s forehead. He did not have that sort of feeling toward Chu Lingxi.

However, right at that moment, Chu Feng’s expression suddenly changed. He then turned his gaze downward.

He was already able to see the bottom of the pond. However, what caught Chu Feng’s attention was a black pearl at the bottom of the pond.

Not only was that pearl emitting a dazzling radiance, but ten beasts were surrounding that pearl.

Those ten beasts were each over a hundred meters long. While their appearances differed, they were all extremely fierce.

They were like guardians protecting that black pearl.

Right at that moment, Chu Lingxi shouted in surprise. “Heavens! That’s the legendary Ten Souls Pearl!!!”
