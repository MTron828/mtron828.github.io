Chapter 5950: A Divine Armament Gift, Frenzy Tsunami Saber

“Hoh, you have even learned how to keep me in suspense. Do you think there’s anything I haven’t seen before? Come, tell me what’s his background.” Little Fishy’s grandfather was curious.

Little Fishy proceeded to share Chu Feng’s affairs with her grandfather.

“No wonder! He’s Jie Ranqing’s son. His father shouldn’t be anyone simple, right? I remember Jie Ranqing is a picky person. The Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Jie Mubai is a monstrously talented individual who shook the world of cultivation back then too, but Jie Ranqing wouldn’t even spare him a proper glance. I’d love to see what kind of outstanding talent Chu Feng’s father is.

“I have to say that Chu Feng is a brave child though. I’d have never thought that a junior without any backing would dare to stand against Jie Tianran, that old thing.”

Little Fishy’s grandfather was overjoyed to hear about Chu Feng’s identity and exploits. He couldn’t stop complimenting the unconscious Chu Feng.

Then, he turned to Little Fishy and said, “I was in a dilemma as to how we can find someone worthy of our Yu’er, considering that our Yu’er is so outstanding. Jie Ranqing has done us a huge favor this time by giving birth to such an outstanding child. The two of you are a perfect match for each other!”

“Grandfather, don’t talk nonsense. I’m going to get angry!” Little Fishy exclaimed.

“All right, I shan’t say anymore. But why is your face so red?” Little Fishy’s grandfather stared at Little Fishy’s reddened face for a second before his lower jaws dropped. “Heck! It can’t be that you have fallen in love with him? You told me earlier that he isn’t courting you... Are you the one courting him instead?!”

“What nonsense are you spouting!” Little Fishy glared at her grandfather.

“All right, I shan’t spout nonsense. It doesn’t matter who’s courting whom; the outcome is what’s important. Rest assured, Yu’er. I’ll support you!” Little Fishy’s grandfather said with a smile.

“Grandfather, you...” Little Fishy sighed in resignation, but a thought suddenly popped into her mind, and she asked with a cheery smile, “Grandfather, why do you have such a high opinion of Chu Feng even though he offended Jie Tianran? Aren’t you afraid of Jie Tianran coming after our Immortal Sea Fish Clan if we protect him?”

“I only said that I support the two of you. I never promised to protect Chu Feng.” Little Fishy’s grandfather gave her the side eye.

“Hey! You were still boasting earlier that you would stand up for me and big brother! Were you just taking me for a ride?” Little Fishy pouted.

“Nonsense! I’d never take you for a ride. I mean my words. However, the two of you are young, so I don’t think we should rush into anything. It’s not too late to settle it after the two of you get a little older,” Little Fishy’s grandfather replied. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Little Fishy caught her grandfather’s drift—I do have a high opinion of Chu Feng, but this matter mustn’t be made public.

“Grandfather, do you fear Jie Tianran too?” Little Fishy frowned.

If even the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was unable to protect Chu Feng, there would probably be no power who could protect him anymore.

“I don’t fear him, but Jie Tianran and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion aren’t that simple. Yu’er, we are the leaders of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. We have to prioritize the interest of our clansmen above all things. Expressing support for Chu Feng would mean going against the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion. If Jie Tianran chooses to deal with us, our clansmen will be the casualties. Surely you don’t want our clansmen to die over Chu Feng, right?”

Little Fishy fell silent. While she hoped that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan could protect Chu Feng, her grandfather’s words made sense too. She couldn’t allow her clansmen to pay the price for her selfishness.

“All right, that’s enough for now. Tell me how you got captured by the Netherworld Sect. What are their goals?” Little Fishy’s grandfather asked.

...

Chu Feng was out for a long time from overexerting himself.

When he finally woke up, before he opened his eyes, he had already sensed that he was lying on a comfortable bed. This indicated that someone had saved them from the Netherworld Sect.

A euphonious voice sounded as soon as Chu Feng opened his eyes.

“Big brother, you’re awake!”

Looking at Little Fishy’s delicate face, Chu Feng thought that it was a feast for the eyes. However, a merry face covered in wrinkles quickly cut right in front and covered Little Fishy’s face.

“Our grandson-in-law, you’re awake?”

Chu Feng was so shocked by the sudden appearance of the old face that he immediately shot upright. He looked at Little Fishy and asked, “He is...”

“Big brother, this is my grandfather!” Little Fishy quickly explained.

“Junior Chu Feng pays respect to elder.” Chu Feng quickly got up and bowed to Little Fishy’s grandfather.

“Ey, there’s no need to be so courteous. Just call me grandfather like Yu’er does.”

“Is that fine?”

“Of course. You’re my grandson-in-law, after all,” Little Fishy’s grandfather cheerily replied.

“Ahh...” Chu Feng had no idea how to answer those words, so he chose to change the topic instead. “Elder, did you capture the Netherworld Sectmembers?”

“We caught small fries, but we couldn’t get anything out of them. We only know that the Netherworld Sect is behind this matter. Our Immortal Sea Fish Clan shall remember this grudge,” Little Fishy’s grandfather sneered.

“How is Lord Xianhai Shiyue and the others?”

“They got ambushed and suffered huge casualties, but Shiyue survived the ordeal. Speaking of which, I have to thank you for reminding Shiyue to be careful, or else she might have lost her life there.”

Little Fishy’s grandfather had gotten to the bottom of the situation by now, so he knew that Little Fishy wasn’t lying to him; Chu Feng had single-handedly saved her from the Netherworld Sect.

“Grandson-in-law, we have you to thank for this. This is a small token of my appreciation.”

Little Fishy’s grandfather reached into his Cosmos Sack and took out a rectangular box. This box had gemstones embedded in it, a sign that it contained something invaluable.

“Take it, big brother!” Little Fishy unhesitatingly snatched the box from her grandfather and stuffed it into Chu Feng’s hands. At the same time, she sent Chu Feng a voice transmission, “You have to take it. It is something good.”

“Thank you, elder.” Chu Feng took the box and opened it.

It was a saber emanating the Ancient Era’s aura. It had a blue blade with watermarks flowing on its surface. The words ‘Frenzy Tsunami Saber’ were inscribed on it.

It was a God Armament.

“I bought this Tsunami Frenzy Saber at a high price. It’s an extremely high-quality God Armament. I intended to give it to Yu’er, but she doesn’t like this saber, saying that the name doesn’t suit her. However, I figured it’d be the same to give it to you too,” Little Fishy’s grandfather said.

“It’s a formidable saber,” Chu Feng replied.

“Indeed, but it’s hard to control too. You should try taming it,” Little Fishy’s grandfather suggested.

“All right.” Chu Feng grabbed the weapon and infused his bloodline aura into it.

Little Fishy’s grandfather quickly reminded, “Be careful. The Frenzy Tsunami Saber has a violent temperament...”

The next instant, his face stiffened, for he sensed Chu Feng’s aura flowing out of the Frenzy Tsunami Saber. This meant that Chu Feng had successfully tamed the saber.

“S-so fast?” Little Fishy’s grandfather was shocked, for he knew that the Frenzy Tsunami Saber being hard to control wasn’t just a rumor.

At the same time, an ancient character for ‘True’ surfaced on its body, but it swiftly vanished.

“It’s truly a formidable saber.”

Chu Feng knew from the ‘True’ character that this God Armament was of excellent quality. The same word had appeared back when he stole Huangfu Shengyu’s spear.

According to Xianhai Shaoyu, that was a symbol of quality.
