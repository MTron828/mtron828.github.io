Chapter 5516: The Totem Phoenix Clan Poaches

Uwa!

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen were shoved out from the formation core, but Chu Feng remained unharmed. It didn’t take long for the entire formation to crackle with frightening red lightning. The formation had been completed.

While Chu Feng’s success was within expectation, it was still shocking to see it in person.

“Aren’t you too formidable, Chu Feng?”

“Let’s see how those Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen can stay arrogant!”

Long Zhizhi pranced around the formation core in excitement, though she was not the only one who felt that way. It was the same for the other Totem Dragon Clansmen too. They thought that no one could accomplish this task better than them now that Chu Feng was here.

“You should head in and cultivate,” Chu Feng told Long Zhizhi and the others.

“I can’t do that yet. I need to vie for the other formations,” Long Zhizhi said.

“That’s true.” Chu Feng nodded.

“The rest of you head in first,” Long Yuhong ordered the other Totem Dragon Clansmen.

“Thank you, young hero Chu Feng,” the Totem Dragon Clansmen thanked Chu Feng before entering the formation core.

Shortly after they entered, a light pillar in the distance became shrouded with a qilin silhouette. The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan had dominated another formation.

Moments later, another formation was enveloped by a dragon silhouette. The Totem Dragon Clan had dominated another formation too.

The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan was indeed formidable, taking the lead with three formations, but Long Zhizhi and Long Yuhong weren’t worried at all. They knew that the Totem Dragon Clan had four formations under their control at the moment, given that Chu Feng was their ally.

With the speed Chu Feng conquered the formations, they would surely gain control of most formations at the very end.

“So you’re the culprit, Chu Feng!” Feng Tiansheng’s infuriated voice echoed from behind.

Feng Jiuyue and the other Totem Phoenix Clansmen, whom he had encountered in the first formation and along the way, were here too.

“Are you planning to make a move?” Long Yuhong and Long Zhizhi took their positions in front of Chu Feng.

“Hmph! Do you think you can stop us?” Feng Tiansheng sneered.

“You had an agreement with young master Chengyu to compete fairly with our capabilities and not resort to violence. Young master Chengyu won’t let you off easily if you dare break the agreement,” Long Yuhong said.

“Do you think I’m afraid of Long Chengyu? Scram!” Feng Tiansheng wasn’t fazed in the least.

It looked like he was planning to shove Long Yuhong and Long Zhizhi aside to attack Chu Feng, but a person suddenly flitted in front of Feng Tiansheng. It was Feng Jiuyue. She first stopped Feng Tiansheng before she turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Have you consumed the pill yet?”

“I’m thankful for your goodwill, but I don’t need it,” Chu Feng replied as he tossed the box back to Feng Jiuyue.

“That’s not what I mean,” Feng Jiuyue replied with a smile as she tossed the box back to him. “Chu Feng, are you interested in working together with our Totem Phoenix Clan? Feel free to state whatever you want. Even if I can’t give it to you now, I’ll compensate you later on.”

“What do you mean by that? Are you poaching our people?” Long Zhizhi frowned in displeasure.

Paying no heed to Long Zhizhi, Feng Jiuyue kept her eyes on Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, our Totem Phoenix Clan can give you far more than what the Totem Dragon Clan gave you. We’ll fulfill your demand as long as you help us complete this mission. Even God Armaments are not out of the question.”

“God Armaments? What a joke! Do you even have one?” Long Zhizhi mocked.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“We’re sincere about this, Chu Feng. I, Feng Jiuyue, am a person of my word,” Feng Jiuyue said.

“What if I disagree?” Chu Feng asked.

Feng Jiuyue’s eyes narrowed. “Young hero Chu Feng, you are a formidable individual. The last thing I want to do is to make an enemy out of you. However, this mission is of great importance to our Totem Phoenix Clan. If you refuse to cooperate, I’ll have no choice but to offend you.”

“You’ll force me to do your bidding?” Chu Feng asked.

“If we have to, we will. However, I still hope that we don’t come to that stage. I’d prefer to have an amicable partnership with you,” Feng Jiuyue replied.

“Heh…” Chu Feng chuckled. “I would have been open to working with you, but I am already with the Totem Dragon Clan. Long Chengyu and Long Muxi are my close friends. I’ll never do things that constitute a betrayal to my friends,” Chu Feng said.

“Young hero Chu Feng, we have already analyzed your means. Give up. You won’t be able to escape with them,” Feng Jiuyue said.

She knew that Chu Feng was no pushover, which was why she had been assessing him throughout their conversation. Her eyes were only glowing brightly because she was utilizing a formidable observation means.

That was why she could tell that Chu Feng had constructed a formation chain and wrapped it around Long Yuhong, Long Zhizhi, and the other Totem Dragon Clansmen standing outside the formation core. It was clear that he was thinking of escaping with Long Zhizhi and the others.

“You’ll know soon enough whether I can escape from you or not,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

His silhouette suddenly vanished, and Long Zhizhi and the others let out piercing shrieks. From their perspectives, they were suddenly dragged away by some unknown force.

Feng Jiuyue and Feng Tiansheng immediately gave chase, knowing that Chu Feng was trying to escape. The other Totem Phoenix Clansmen also followed suit, but they had no choice but to halt shortly after as they realized that they couldn’t catch up at all.

In order to chase Chu Feng, Feng Tiansheng activated his bloodline power, raising his martial cultivation from rank four Half-God level to rank six Half-God level. On the other hand, Feng Jiuyue was a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, which was equivalent to rank six Half-God level cultivators.

Yet, neither of them was able to catch up with Chu Feng. They were only barely able to keep pace.

“How is that fellow that fast? Is he a rank six Half-God level cultivator?” Feng Tiansheng asked.

“He isn’t. It’s well-hidden, but I could vaguely sense from his aura that he’s a rank two Half-God level cultivator,” Feng Jiueyue replied.

“Big sister, you must be mistaken. How could a rank two Half-God level cultivator possibly outspeed us?” Feng Tiansheng didn’t believe Feng Jiuyue’s words.
