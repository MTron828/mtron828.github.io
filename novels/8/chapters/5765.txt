Chapter 5765: Immemorial Divine Water

“It’s ranked seven?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, it’s ranked seven. Based on the r-r-ranking, it’s even stronger than my Four Fiends Divine Body. However, the Blazing Sun Divine Body is v-v-very hard to control.”

According to Wang Qiang, it had been a long time since anyone had been able to control the Blazing Sun Divine Body. In fact, he guessed that the death of Yuwen Yanri’s father was a result of the backlash from inheriting the Blazing Sun Divine Body.

This showed just how violent the Blazing Sun Divine Body was.

And based on what he knew, Yuwen Yanri had already successfully inherited the Blazing Sun Divine Body.

“Is that the reason Yuwen Yanri’s body is in such a weakened state?” Chu Feng asked.

“Y-y-yes, it is. The Blazing Sun Divine Body is very powerful, s-s-such that Yuwen Yanri will be put under great s-s-suffering even though he has already inherited it,” Wang Qiang replied.

“What’s Yuwen Yanri’s cultivation level?” Chu Feng asked.

“I-I-I don’t know. R-r-rank six Half-God, I think,” Wang Qiang replied.

“What about the other Divine Bodies?” Chu Feng asked.

Wang Qiang proceeded to share the ranking of the other Divine Bodies.

1: Indestructible Divine Body

2: Heavenly Demon Divine Body

3: Four Symbols Divine Body

4: Nirvana Divine Body

5: Dharma Divine Body

6: Heavenly Lightning Divine Body

7: Blazing Sun Divine Body

8: Brilliant Moon Divine Body

9: Resurrection Divine Body

10: Four Fiends Divine Body

Just as his father had told him, the Four Symbols Divine Body was ranked third in the ranking of the Divine Bodies, though what interested him more was the rank six Heavenly Lightning Divine Body. He wondered if it was related to the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline.

According to Wang Qiang, the strongest Divine Body in the present world of cultivation was the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Blazing Sun Divine Body. The other Divine Bodies did appear in the Ancient Era before, but they hadn’t been seen since, so Wang Qiang didn’t know much about them either.

“B-b-but the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master said that the ranking isn’t absolute. H-h-how powerful a Divine Body is depends on the possessor’s strength. It’s j-j-just like how a weapon can exert different strength in d-d-different hands,” Wang Qiang said.

“That’s true. I should share a piece of good news with you.”

Chu Feng told Wang Qiang that Zhao Hong possessed a Divine Body too, and it was likely to be the rank nine Resurrection Divine Body.

“R-r-really? I knew that my w-w-wife was no ordinary person, just that I d-d-didn’t think she would be even stronger than me!” Wang Qiang was immediately convinced that Zhao Hong possessed the rank nine Resurrection Divine Body. “I-I-I don’t know about the other Divine Bodies, but I know a b-b-bit about the Resurrection Divine Body as it appeared in the Ancient Era. It was r-r-ranked nine not because it’s stronger than my Four Fiend Divine body, but because it makes one v-v-very hard to kill. My w-w-wife will be fine with such a Divine Body!”

Chu Feng could tell from his expression that he was worried about Zhao Hong’s safety.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Zhao Hong will be fine. The mysterious man captured Zhao Hong to threaten me, but he didn’t hurt me. That makes me think that mysterious man is a friend and not a foe, just that he wanted to push for my growth or had other intentions in mind,” Chu Feng said.

“I-I-I think so too, or else t-t-that person must have too much time on hand!” Wang Qiang agreed with a hearty laugh.

He was as optimistic, entertaining, and jovial as before.

“Speaking of which, do you know that the Nine Heavens’ Zenith has commenced?” Chu Feng asked.

Wang Qiang had been so focused on his cultivation that he didn’t notice Chu Feng and Yuwen Yanri’s presence earlier. It was possible that he didn’t know that the Nine Heavens’ Zenith had commenced yet.

“R-r-really? I didn’t know.” Wang Qiang shook his head.

Chu Feng told Wang Qiang about how the Nine Heavens’ Zenith would commence tomorrow, but the latter expressed that he wouldn’t be joining. He was already spending a huge amount of time on his cultivation that it would be difficult for him to participate in the tournament.

In truth, he had only come here because he wanted to see Chu Feng.

Chu Feng knew that Wang Qiang was in danger due to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, so he didn’t try to advise the latter to participate. Instead, he told him to cultivate at ease.

“R-r-right, Brother Chu Feng. T-t-this is for you,” Wang Qiang said as he passed a jade bottle to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng uncorked the jade bottle. It was filled with a golden fluid that emanated a peculiar energy. It was similar to a forbidden medicine, in the sense that it could quickly raise one’s fighting prowess with sufficient quality and proper refinement, but there was no backlash at all.

It was an invaluable treasure!

“What’s this?” Chu Feng asked.

“I-I-Immemorial Divine Water,” Wang Qiang replied.

“This is the Immemorial Divine Water?”

“Y-y-you have heard about it?”

“I have.”

Chu Feng had heard about it from Ling Sheng’er.

The latter previously suspected he consumed the Immemorial Divine Water due to his exceptional spirit power fighting prowess. He later learned that the Immemorial Divine Water was a treasure obtained from a remnant, but it was so scarce that only Ling Xiao was allowed to consume it. It was the reason Ling Xiao’s spirit power fighting prowess was that great.

“T-t-this is good stuff! Y-y-you have to mark it as your possession before using it, but I-I-I never did it since I a-a-already have the Four Fiends Divine Body. I-I-I thought it’d be of greater use to you. Let m-m-me teach you how to mark it!” Wang Qiang passed the Immemorial Divine Water to Chu Feng as he added, “D-d-don’t stand on ceremony with me, or else I’ll get angry.”

“All right, I’ll accept it. Actually, I prepared a gift for you too. It’s not worth much, but I made it myself,” Chu Feng said as he passed a pendant over.

“H-h-holy! You made this yourself? T-t-this is more valuable than m-m-my Immemorial Divine Water!” Wang Qiang accepted the pendant and placed it around his neck, cherishing it a lot.

The two of them chatted a while longer before Chu Feng took his leave.

Upon returning to his residence, Chu Feng formed a hand seal and said, “Wang Qiang, can you hear me? I am Chu Feng. Don’t react if you can hear me. There are things I want to tell you.”
