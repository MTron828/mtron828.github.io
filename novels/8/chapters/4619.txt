Chapter 4619: A True Big Thigh

“Least useful one of us three, huh?” Chu Feng sneered coldly.

It was then that he came to a decision in his heart.

In truth, he was really planning on working with these two to clear this labyrinth, but after how they had treated him, their so-called alliance was naturally broken.

The ones who stood the most to lose actually wasn’t Chu Feng but Xia Yan and Xiao Yu, for he was true ‘big thigh’ over here. By betraying him, the two of them were only harming themselves.

Weng!

While Chu Feng was about to be devoured by the eye of the whirlpool, the pearl in his hand suddenly released a radiant glow. Following that, a formation made out of several boats appeared around Chu Feng.

While the lake contained the power of devouring, for some reason, it was unable to devour the formation created by the pearl. While Chu Feng was still unable to free himself from the whirlpool, the presence of this formation still allowed him to be able to avoid drowning in the whirlpool for the time being

And the pearl that released the formation was the one which Xia Yan had given Chu Feng earlier before pushing him down.

“Brother Chu Feng, I’m really sorry about this. Please wait here for the time being, we’ll come back to save you. I’ll make sure to share a portion of the loot we received with you.”

After saying those words, Xia Yan hurried forward with Xiao Yu, and the two of them soon vanished from his line of sight.

Seeing this, Chu Feng hesitated a little.

He initially thought that Xia Yan and Xiao Yu were intending to sacrifice him to pass this black lake, but from the looks of it, he had misunderstood them. Of course, there was no doubt that the two of them were making use of him, but they weren’t intending to take his life.

Or else, Xia Yan didn’t have to throw the pearl over to him before pushing him down into the whirlpool.

“Well, you’re really putting me in a spot here,” Chu Feng muttered to himself.

He infused his spirit power into the pearl, and the formation that had just appeared swiftly receded back into the pearl.

Chu Feng had forcefully dispelled the formation.

However, instead of being dragged into the whirlpool, his body actually began floating upward. Despite the devastating momentum of the whirlpool, it was unable to trap him any longer. It didn’t take long for Chu Feng to free himself from the confines of the whirlpool.

The reason why he could do this was because he controlled a portion of the energy of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. It might only be a small portion, but it was more than enough for him to maneuver across the traps.

This was the advantage that the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk brought to him. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After freeing himself from the whirlpool, Chu Feng quickly concealed his presence before following the path which Xiao Yu and Xia Yan disappeared toward.

At this moment, those two had no idea that Chu Feng had freed himself from the control of the black lake, and they were rushing forward quickly. Chu Feng noticed that they were traveling visibly faster than before.

Initially, he was still a little confused as to why they were in such a hurry till Xiao Yu suddenly came to a halt, and Xia Yan started rushing him.

“Brother Xiao Yu, hurry up. Brother Chu Feng is still waiting for us! I have no idea how long that treasure of mine can last in the black lake, so we must quickly find the Illusory Jadestone, or else he would be in danger!”

Xia Yan spoke with a grave tone that was at odds with his usual lackadaisical self.

As it turned out, Xia Yan wasn’t deceiving Chu Feng. He was really intending on saving Chu Feng from the black lake, and this changed some of the plans that he was intending to carry out.

“I won’t stop you if you want to save him, but before that, we should at least ensure our safety first. Can’t you tell that there’s a formation ahead of us?” Xiao Yu said.

“A formation?”

Xia Yan quickly took out the map of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace which he had spent a great deal of money to purchase.

However, based on the records of his map, the road ahead was supposed to be unhindered. There was no so-called formation there.

“Where’s the formation?” Xia Yan asked.

“Arent’ you a world spiritist? Can’t you see for yourself?”

Xiao Yu shot him a glare before he started setting a formation of his own.

Seeing this, Xia Yan began forming hand seals with a single hand while swiping his other hand in front of him. His eyes began to change colors.

Soon, his face darkened lividly.

“Shit! This map isn’t reliable at all!” Xia Yan cursed under his breath.

He quickly began constructing a formation too.

“Activate!”

All of a sudden, Xiao Yu bellowed loudly as he pointed his finger ahead of him.

Boom!

The empty path ahead of them began tremoring violently, causing the space to start warping. A huge marsh filled with thorns gradually came into appearance under the warping of space.

As it turned out, this was one of the hidden traps in the labyrinth.

It was fortunate that Xiao Yu had discovered it early, or else given the prowess of the trap, the two of them might really lose their lives if they stepped on it.

“Assist me!”

Xiao Yu shouted to Xia Yan as he prepared to activate the main formation to breach the revealed trap.

“I advise you not to make a move recklessly. With this bit of strength, not only will you be able to breach the formation, you’ll suffer a fatal rebound too.”

It was then that a voice sounded right behind them.

Xia Yan quickly turned his head around, only to jolt in shock.

“Brother Chu Feng, you... you managed to free yourself?”

Xia Yan stared at Chu Feng with a look of disbelief.

A hint of bewilderment also flickered across Xiao Yu’s eyes, but it was clear that he didn’t think much of Chu Feng’s warning.

With a loud bellow, he ordered, “Activate!”

Following that, the formation he constructed began releasing a huge burst of power toward the trap in front, aiming to sweep it away with brute force.

Boom!

However, as soon as the burst of power struck the trap, the trap immediately exploded with great force. The explosion blasted the marsh forward, trapping the two of them. Following that, the thorns in the marsh began whizzing forward to kill them.

One must know that those thorns were not as simple as they seemed. If those thorns were to really strike them squarely, it was likely that would be the end of them.

Unfortunately, they were stuck amidst the marsh, preventing them from escaping. On top of that, it was already too late for them to put up any significant defense. As a result, they could only stand helplessly as they awaited the thorns to claim their lives.

Weng!

At this crucial moment, a barrier suddenly formed right in front of them, blocking off the onslaught of the thorns.

The one who created the barrier was, needless to say, Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, you...”

Both Xia Yan and Xiao Yu turned around to look at Chu Feng in shock. They could sense just how powerful the trap was, such that even the two of them would find it hard to fend against the thorns even if they were well-prepared. Yet, the barrier which Chu Feng put up actually managed to block the thorns off easily.

This made them realize that Chu Feng was actually far stronger than them.

On top of that, they could vaguely sense a unique aura coming from Chu Feng’s barrier.

As it would have it, Chu Feng was actually the real ‘big thigh’ that they should be hugging!
