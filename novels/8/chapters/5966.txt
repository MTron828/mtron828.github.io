Chapter 5967: Final Victor

Chu Feng calmly looked at the Spirituality Sacred Clansmen, but somehow, his composed face looked terrifying to them.

“S-she deserves to die!”

The Spirituality Sacred Clan’s elders nodded and agreed with Chu Feng even though the one who had just died was their most outstanding junior.

Chu Feng chuckled. “She wasn’t the only one transmitting information outward. You were doing the same too. If she deserves to die, what about the rest of you?”

The faces of the Spirituality Sacred Clansmen present paled in despair. Their transmission method was much more discreet compared to Tongling Yueyue, but it was true that they had been sending information out.

They didn’t expect Chu Feng to see through it. That explained why Chu Feng severed their whiskers.

Uwa!

Cries of agony ensued.

Chu Feng used the gate’s formation energy to crush the Spirituality Sacred Clansmen, and blood splattered as their bodies exploded. Within moments, there were only three experts from the Spirituality Sacred Clan left in the area.

These three people were rank seven True Dragon World Spiritists. Yet, they were trembling, completely devoid of the airs of an expert. All that was left in them was fear.

With a wave of his sleeves, the deceased’s origin energies and treasures flew from the blood puddle into Chu Feng’s grasp. He turned to the three remaining survivors and asked with a cold glint in his eyes, “Are you afraid of death?”

The trio dared not speak. They wanted to beg for mercy, but they knew it was futile. The only fate awaiting them was death.

“Don’t be afraid. Unlike the others, I have use for the three of you. You still have a chance to make amends.”

Chu Feng channeled the gate’s formation energy into the three rank seven True Dragon World Spiritists’ bodies. Then, he raised his palm and aimed it at them. “Open your mouths.”

The three of them quickly did as they were told.

Chu Feng tossed three pills into their mouths. These were no ordinary poison pills; they were embedded with a formation that allowed Chu Feng to take their lives at any moment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Under normal circumstances, they should have been able to easily destroy this formation, given that Chu Feng’s spirit power was far weaker than theirs. However, they dared not to resist due to the formation energy being exerted from the gate.

They could only watch helplessly as Chu Feng’s execution formation imprinted itself into their bodies, till their life forces were locked in place.

“Don’t panic. I’ll let you live if you perform well, but I won’t hesitate to kill you if you dare play tricks on me. Ling Mouzi has never one-upped me before, so think twice about how much you’re worth before doing anything reckless. I should remind you that death is a mercy too. I can make you experience a fate worse than death,” Chu Feng said.

“Young hero Chu Feng, we’ll make amends for our mistakes. We won’t betray you any more,” the three experts from the Spirituality Sacred Clan exclaimed.

“Good. I hope you mean it.”

Chu Feng turned around. The tightly shut doors opened, and he walked in. The three experts exchanged looks before obediently following Chu Feng in as if his servants.

Meanwhile, there was an underground formation core outside the remnant that emanated a brilliant light. Others would be shocked if they saw this formation core, for its outer appearance and aura felt even more formidable than the Ancestral Martial Sect’s remnant.

This was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s means, evident from its many experts gathered in the center of the formation core. Their faces were pale, a sign that they had just sustained a major backlash.

These were the people who had just escaped from Chu Feng—Jie Tian, Ling Mouzi, and the others.

“Saint-tier elder, you claimed that the Spirituality Sacred Clan is one of our aces, but they are utterly useless. We would have become laughingstocks for the world if not for me awakening this sealed formation with my bloodline power.

“It’s one thing for me since the world already sees me as second to Chu Feng, but you are a Saint-tier elder of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion! You can’t die in Chu Feng’s hands too, or else our reputation will take a huge hit! Do you want our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to become gossip fodder for the world?” Jie Tian said in a reproachful tone.

“I have let my guard slip. I didn’t expect Chu Feng to be that cunning,” Ling Mouzi replied in self-reproach, looking like an underling who had done wrong before Jie Tian despite being a Saint-tier elder.

However, none of the elders thought that there was anything wrong with Ling Mouzi’s attitude.

Jie Tian might be a junior, but his standing was not that simple. They had to show respect to even Ling Xiao, not to mention that Jie Tian was the mansion master’s grandson and was likely to take over as the mansion master in the future.

Jie Tian looked at the token. He could still track Chu Feng’s movement via the formation map.

“This isn’t good. Chu Feng is still deciphering the formations. Young master Jie Tian, I’ll bring our men over to capture him. He’s no longer a threat without the gate formation to back him up. He still has eight counts of death immunity, but worse comes to worst, we’ll just sacrifice eight of our men. Our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has no lack of fearless warriors who are willing to lay down their lives for our cause!” a white-bearded elder said.

He was Ling Mouzi’s aide.

However, Jie Tian sneered at his words.

“Our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has no lack of fearless warriors, but you know what else we have no lack of? Fools!” These words started calm, but it quickly crescendoed in anger.

Jie Tian glared at the white-bearded old man and roared, “Are you that naive to think that Chu Feng has no other means? Can’t you tell that he intentionally emphasized time and time again that the gate is his final means? Someone cunning enough to outwit all of us wouldn’t be so foolish as to reveal such critical information. You must have lived your years in vain to leap into such an obvious trap!”

Jie Tian’s saliva flew on the old man’s face, but the latter quietly lowered his head. He was intimidated, though the others present felt the same too.

They were not afraid of Jie Tian’s spirit power but his background.

Ling Mouzi glared at the white-bearded old man too, for he harbored the same thoughts. He also thought that Chu Feng had other means up his sleeves, but the latter intentionally said those words to lure them in once more. He didn’t think that it was a good idea to carelessly approach Chu Feng once more.

Their sealing formation was formidable, but its primary purpose was to seal off the realm, not to save them. The teleportation energy they had used to escape was only a secondary function, so they wouldn’t be able to use it in the short term anymore.

“Young master Jie Tian, what should we do next? Are we going to let Chu Feng continue deciphering the formation?” Ling Mouzi asked.

Even he had decided to follow Jie Tian’s orders.

“Of course. Let him decipher the formations. We don’t stand a chance against him in the remnant, but he doesn’t stand a chance against us out of the remnant.” Jie Tian looked at the formation map in his hand, specifically the speck of light representing Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, I’ll let you know who’s the final victor if you dare to come out of the remnant.”

Those words were spoken with gritted teeth.
