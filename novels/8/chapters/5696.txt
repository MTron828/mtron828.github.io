Chapter 5696: Who’s the Useless One

The ten warrior sculptures charged at the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master with blades in hand. Blinding flashes of golden light clashed with spirit power, producing cataclysmic shockwaves.

“Formation activate!”

The seven Saint-tier elders took the lead to work with the other elders to construct a massive barrier that enveloped the area. This barrier served not just to protect the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s juniors but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion itself too.

Just the shockwaves from a battle of this scale could lead to cataclysmic outcomes if no attempts were made to control it.

Yet, it took only a few shockwaves to crack the barrier. The Saint-tier elders despaired, knowing that the barrier they created was not enough to stop the shockwaves. They could survive the shockwaves, but the same couldn’t be said about the others.

Weng!

Just then, an even more powerful barrier overlapped the one they had created. Three elders appeared at the same time.

“Lord Grand Elders!” The Saint-tier elders breathed a sigh of relief.

The three of them were the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s grand elders. One of the elders with black hair was the Ling Clan’s Clan Chief. Together, they formed one of the strongest forces in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion

“Why are you standing in a daze? Channel your spirit power over!” the Ling Clan’s Clan Chief roared.

All of the Saint-tier elders and the other elders quickly channeled their spirit power into the barrier created by the grand elders to reinforce it.

Someone else was lingering in the vicinity of Chu Feng and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master’s battle—the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster. He was powerful enough to be unharmed by the shockwaves produced by their clashes.

The Saint-tier elders couldn’t clearly perceive what was happening in the battle in the sky, but he could tell that the ten warrior sculptures were extremely powerful. Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was unable to gain the upper hand against them. He had to exert his full force just to deal with them.

Otherwise, given the means of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, he wouldn’t have allowed others to be implicated by the shockwaves of their fight. It was not that he didn’t want to protect the members of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion but that he didn’t have the means to!

The ten warrior sculptures were simply too terrifying!

“World Spiritist Immortal King, why did you hand such a powerful formation to an outsider? Aren’t you afraid of bringing about the downfall of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster didn’t know that the World Spiritist Immortal King’s imprint would only be triggered when the possessor stumbled into danger. He only thought that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have been in deep trouble if the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master wasn’t around.

All of a sudden, he recalled something and expectantly turned his eyes toward the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. “Even if that legendary figure exists, I doubt that he’d easily make a move, right? I guess the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master will have to resolve this situation on his own.”

He turned to look at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was still being protected by a barrier, but it had contracted till it was only enveloping his body, possibly because he had expended too much energy to summon the ten warrior sculptures. Furthermore, his eyes were tightly closed.

It probably took a lot out of him to maintain the ten warrior sculptures even if he wasn’t manually controlling them. Thus, a sinister gleam flashed across the eyes of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster.

With a flick of his wrist, he drew a beautiful jade sword that emitted indomitable might. It was a God Armament.

“Audacious, Chu Feng. How dare you cause a scene in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? How many people will die in your hands if I leave you be? I shall punish you in place of the heavens today!” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster declared before charging at Chu Feng.

Just as he was about to reach Chu Feng’s barrier, the remaining two formation cores beneath Chu Feng’s feet suddenly emitted a brilliant light. Two warrior sculptures suddenly appeared out of nowhere and attacked the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster.

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster boasted a height of three meters, but he looked no different from an ant compared to the thousand-meter-tall warrior sculptures. Nevertheless, it would be foolish to underestimate his strength.

His attacks harnessed cataclysmic might, but he was unable to defeat the two warrior sculptures. It was only then that he realized just how powerful the warrior sculptures were.

“What’s going on?”

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster raised his head and saw that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was still fighting with ten warrior sculptures. It left him wondering where the additional two warrior sculptures had come from.

An imprint reminiscent of an eye manifested on his forehead, allowing him see through all things.

.

“Damn it! That brat didn’t go all out!”

It was only now that he realized that two of the warrior sculptures in the sky were illusions. Chu Feng had kept two of them with him to protect himself.

Shoosh!

One of the warrior sculptures hacked its saber down on him with indomitable might. Unable to dodge, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster could only face it with his sword.

Clang! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Sparks flew in all directions, and the surroundings shook from the impact.

Even though the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster had survived the attack, the impact sent him flying across the air.

“Step down, Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster! Your interference is unnecessary for our internal affairs!” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master roared.

“All right, I’ll back down now.”

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster turned tail and fled. To his relief, Chu Feng didn’t pursue him, choosing instead to bring the two warrior sculptures back to his side.

Only getting a safe distance away, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster realized that blood was seeping from his mouth. It was from the internal injury he had sustained from the earlier blow.

“Damn it! I hope no one noticed it,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster murmured as he quickly wiped his mouth.

He looked at Chu Feng, followed by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, then muttered, “Those two monsters!”

Just a brief exchange with the two warrior sculptures had injured him. While he had gotten careless, it did show how powerful the warrior sculptures were. Even if they had continued the fight, they would have probably forced him to a corner.

Yet, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was simultaneously dealing with eight of the warrior sculptures in the sky.

Clearly, he was being overpowered here.

As for Chu Feng, it was a formidable feat for a God-cloak World Spiritist like him to exert the power of the imprint to this extent, to the point that it was practically an impossible feat.

What else were they if not monsters?

“Chu Feng, you claimed that you look down on our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but you’re using our powers here. Doesn’t that mean you’re incompetent?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master questioned.

Chu Feng snorted in disdain and replied, “Old coot, I concede that I am using the powers of your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to deal with you and your Saint-tier elders, but you’re saying that I’m incompetent because of that?

“Let me ask you a question then, Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. Why is it that I can decipher formations that you can’t? Why is it that I am in possession of an imprint none of you possess? Between me and your juniors, it’s clear who are the truly incompetent ones here.”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master didn’t answer Chu Feng’s question, but his attacks became even more aggressive. He had been angered.

Chu Feng frowned. There was a limit to the power he could receive from the imprint, whereas there seemed to be no limit to the strength of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.

Without a doubt, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master wasn’t showing his true strength yet.
