Chapter 2456 - Chu Feng’s Plan

“Benefactor, I am truly sorry for how unrighteous and unjust my clan has been. We have made you suffer.”

After Zhan Lingling entered the prison cell, she had a very apologetic expression on her face. However, she did not try to say too many superfluous words, and instead got to the main subject right away.

She grabbed Chu Feng and said, “Benefactor, the guards of this place have already been lured away by my brother. Let’s seize this opportunity to escape. Else, if we are to delay, I fear that you will not be able to escape.”

She had actually come to save Chu Feng.

“I’m afraid that it wouldn’t do to leave like this. You and your brother will end up being punished by your father,” Chu Feng shook his head.

Chu Feng had no idea how Zhan Lingling managed to obtain the key to the prison cell.

However, he knew that if he were to escape like that, the matter of Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong helping him escape would definitely be discovered.

Once the matter got exposed, Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong would definitely be severely punished.

Chu Feng did not wish to implicate Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong.

“Benefactor, you do not have to concern yourself with this. Come, follow me,” Zhan Lingling urged anxiously.

“How about this: answer me a question. Are there any Immortal-cloak World Spiritists in your Ancient Era’s War Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

“Immortal-cloak World Spiritists? No, we do not. We have only heard of that sort of powerful world spiritist before, how could our clan possibly possess any?”

Zhan Lingling said no immediately. Furthermore, she had a perplexed expression on her face. Evidently, she had no idea why Chu Feng had asked that question.

“If there aren’t, it will be easy to deal with then,” As Chu Feng spoke, he sat cross-legged, and his hands started to rapidly change.

Spirit power began to flow out from Chu Feng’s body in a steady stream. In the end, it took the form of a person before him.

That person, regardless of whether it be clothes or appearance, was exactly the same as Chu Feng.

“This is?” Seeing that, Zhan Lingling immediately revealed an astonished expression.

She was able to tell that that person must’ve been created by Chu Feng through a spirit formation. Actually, she had seen many clones formed with spirit formations before too.

However, for the great majority of them, one could tell with a single glance that they had been formed with a spirit formation. Never had she ever seen a spirit formation clone that looked like a carbon copy of the original, like Chu Feng’s spirit formation.

Thus, she felt it to be incredible. Thus, she asked, “Benefactor, c-could this be your clone?”

“Indeed, it is my clone. This clone of mine possesses my aura and shares by vision and hearing. If I am to leave it here, no one will discover that I’ve left,” Chu Feng said.

“But, Benefactor, how were you able to set up such a powerful clone like that? Furthermore, your world spirit techniques are extremely strong. Could it be that... you’re an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” Zhan Lingling asked Chu Feng.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded with a smile on his face.

“Heavens! You’re... you’re really an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?”

“Benefactor, you... you are simply too amazing. At such a young age, you not only possess an extremely high level of cultivation, yet you’re actually also an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

At that moment, Zhan Lingling was looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with admiration. In fact... she was somewhat frenetic.

Before that, she had truly never expected that someone much younger than her would be so much more powerful than her.

“The world is enormous, there are countless people stronger than me.”

Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he began to set up another spirit formation. Soon... he had turned invisible.

“Let’s go. This concealment formation of mine is capable of concealing me from all those below the Martial Ancestor level of cultivation. However, if I am to encounter your father, I might not necessarily be able to conceal myself from him,” Chu Feng said.

“Okay,” Zhan Lingling was completely stunned by Chu Feng’s various techniques.

At that moment, Zhan Lingling couldn’t help but to listen to Chu Feng’s instructions. She began to act according to Chu Feng’s orders.

As per Chu Feng’s instructions, Zhan Lingling did not directly bring Chu Feng away from the Ancient Era’s War Clan. Instead, she brought Chu Feng to her residence.

Zhan Lingtong was also present in Zhan Lingling’s residence.

The reason for that was because the siblings had planned to have Zhan Lingtong lure away the guards while Zhan Lingling rescued Chu Feng, then bring him away.

Zhan Lingtong had arrived in Zhan Lingling’s residence to wait for his older sister’s good news.

“Big sister, why didn’t you bring big brother Chu Feng out, and instead brought him here?”

“Lord Father and the various elders are currently conducting an emergency meeting so as to stabilize our clansmen’s state of mind.”

“They do not have the time to concern themselves with big brother Chu Feng. This is the best time for us to rescue big brother Chu Feng. If we are to miss this opportunity, I fear that an opportunity like this will never present itself again.”

“Come, let’s go and bring big brother Chu Feng out right now. We absolutely cannot afford to let this opportunity slip by,” Upon seeing Chu Feng, Zhan Lingtong became extremely worried. As he spoke, he planned to bring Chu Feng away from their Ancient Era’s War Clan.

“Lingtong, this is my decision, don’t blame your older sister,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah? Big brother Chu Feng, why are you not planning to leave? Could it be that you want to continue to be trapped here?” Zhan Lingtong had a confused expression.

“Listen to me. Right now, your clansmen are in a very unstable state of mind. If I am to truly escape like this, they will definitely find out that it was you and your older sister who helped me escape.”

“With their current state of mind, they might end up disregarding the fact that you two are their fellow clansmen and punish you two by killing you. I, Chu Feng, cannot bring harm upon you for the sake of my own escape.”

“Furthermore, your Ancient Era’s War Clan is currently facing a great enemy in the form of the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan. I still want to help you guys out in this battle.”

“If I am to leave like this, wouldn’t it mean that I will not be able to help you all at all?” Chu Feng said.

“Big brother Chu Feng...” Hearing what Chu Feng said, both Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling revealed stunned expressions. In their eyes it could clearly be seen that they were emotionally moved.

Their Ancient Era’s War Clan had repaid Chu Feng’s kindness with malice. Yet, not only did Chu Feng not hold a grudge, but he was actually still concerned about the safety of their Ancient Era’s War Clan. That truly moved the two of them.

“Big brother Chu Feng, you are truly too kind. However, our clan is truly unworthy of you doing all this.”

“We... are unworthy of your kindness,” Glistening teardrops appeared in Zhan Lingtong’s eyes as he said those words.

“What are you doing? Real men do not easily cry,” With a smile on his face, Chu Feng lightly patted Zhan Lingtong’s shoulder.

Then, he said, “You don’t have to panic. Actually, I have a plan in mind. As long as the two of you are to help me with it, not only will I be able to safely escape, I might even be able to help you all neutralize the threat of the Monstrous Clan.”

“Really?” Hearing those words, Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling’s expressions both changed.

“Really,” With a smile on his face, Chu Feng nodded with a Confidence filled smile.

“Big brother Chu Feng, go ahead and tell us what you want us to do. As long as we siblings are capable of doing it, we will definitely help you,” Zhan Lingtong said.

“Benefactor, go ahead and tell us what you have in mind. We will definitely do as you say,” Zhan Lingling echoed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Then, Chu Feng informed Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong of his plan.

The spirit formation Chu Feng had set up was extremely powerful. Not only were Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong unable to determine that Chu Feng’s clone was a spirit formation, but even the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief would likely not be able to determine that it was a spirit formation clone.

Furthermore, Chu Feng was able to see everything that the clone saw, and could respond using the clone’s mouth.

In a nutshell, Chu Feng was capable of controlling his clone.

However, a spirit formation that powerful would naturally have flaws. As for its flaw, it would be the fact that Chu Feng could not be too far away from the clone.

Thus, when Chu Feng set up his spirit formation clone, he had already decided that he would not leave the Ancient Era’s War Clan.

What Chu Feng planned to do was to trick everyone into thinking that he was still trapped in the prison cell.

As for his actual body, he was planning to enter the Martial Comprehension Ground. Chu Feng planned to train there to reach a breakthrough in his cultivation.

Moreover, Chu Feng was speaking his true feelings when he said that he planned to help the Ancient Era’s Clan neutralize their crisis.

The reason for that was because he had seen a scene of Zhan Haichuan’s training. Although it was only a scene, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Martial Comprehension Ground was no small matter.

Unless he somehow failed to enter it, Chu Feng was certain that he would definitely obtain a great harvest.

If Chu Feng was able to increase his cultivation to a level where he could defeat the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan, he would definitely help the Ancient Era’s War Clan take care of the threat that was the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan.

While the actions of the Ancient Era’s War Clan today were indeed extremely unkind and unjust, it remained that they did not truly plan to kill him, and merely did not want him to take away the Ancient Era’s War Sword. Thus, when looking at it from a different point of view, Chu Feng found it to be pardonable.

Furthermore, as Chu Feng had obtained the powerful secret skill that was the Ancient Era’s War Sword, he wanted to make it up to the Ancient Era’s War Clan.

After all, the Ancient Era’s War Clan was very different from the Kong Heavenly Clan. At the very least, they could still be considered kind-hearted individuals.

After hearing Chu Feng’s plan, Zhan Lingtong asked, “Big brother Chu Feng, you mean to say that you want us to bring you into the Martial Comprehension Ground?”
