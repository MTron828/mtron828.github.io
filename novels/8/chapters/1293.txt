MGA: Chapter 1294 - Raining Curses

“Ying’er, we were merely joking earlier. Huolie is the pride of our Sima Family, how could I possibly sell his remains?”

“Merely, with how precious his remains are, I think it would not be very safe for them to be placed in our Sima Family. Thus, I think it’s best for you to bring them back to the World Spiritist Alliance,” The Sima Villa’s villa master handed Sima Huolie’s remains to Sima Ying.

Seeing this, Sime Ying did not hesitate. She stepped forward and extended her lily-white hands to receive her grandfather’s remains.

However, at the moment when Sima Ying approached him, the Sima Villa villa master’s eyes squinted and a difficult-to-detect cold smile emerged on his face.

Immediately afterward, he released one of his hands that was holding onto Sima Huolie’s remains and went to grab Sima Ying’s hand.

His intention was very clear. He did not have the certainty that he would be able to defeat Chu Feng. Thus, he planned to capture Sima Ying and use her to threaten Chu Feng.

“Damn it.”

Seeing the Sima Villa villa master’s claw-like hand coming toward her, Sima Ying was greatly shocked.

At that moment, she began to subconsciously revolve her martial power around her body. Her footsteps began to shift as she activated a profound movement martial skill to dodge the incoming hand.

However, it was already too late. Not only was the Sima Villa villa master’s cultivation above hers, his strength was also above hers. His attack was as fast as lighting and did not give Sima Ying any opportunity to escape.

“Zzzzzz~~~”

However, right at the moment of imminent peril, at the moment when Sima Ying felt that she would not be able to escape, a ray of lightning flashed past and arrived before Sima Ying.

At the same time, a large hand that was surrounded by lightning was shot forth. It firmly grabbed onto the Sima Villa villa master’s wrist.

“You...”

This sudden occasion caused the Sima Villa villa master’s body to tremble in surprise. After he saw who it was that had come, he was so shocked that his mouth flopped open and eyes were filled with fright.

As for the person that had stopped him, it was naturally Chu Feng.

Merely, the current Chu Feng was different from the one before. At this moment, not only was his body covered with lightning, there was also a pair of lightning wings behind his back. With the pair of wings extending outward, he appeared extremely oppressive.

However, the matter that shocked the Sima Villa’s villa master the most was Chu Feng’s aura. He was no longer a rank five Martial King. Instead, he was now a rank seven Martial King.

When Chu Feng had been a rank five Martial King, he had already been able to easily kill two rank eight Martial Kings. Now that he was a rank seven Martial King, the oppressive sensation that he gave off was beyond one’s imagination.

If the Sima Villa’s villa master had had doubts about Chu Feng’s strength earlier, then he was able to ascertain that he was no match for Chu Feng now.

“Damn it,” Sensing that the situation was bad, the Sima Villa’s villa master immediately began to shake his arms in the hopes of breaking away from Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng merely stood there with a smile on his face. The hand with which he had grabbed onto the Sima Villa villa master’s wrist was solid as a boulder and as stable as a divine tree. The Sima Villa’s villa master was simply unable to move his hand in the slightest.

“Snap.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng clenched his hand. Just like that, the Sima Villa villa master’s wrist was snapped into pieces.

“Wuuu~~~~”

The Sima Villa’s villa master clenched his teeth. He appeared to not want to surrender and did not utter any screams. He stubbornly endured the pain of his wrist breaking.

However, it was clear that Chu Feng did not plan to stop with only this. Chu Feng’s martial power and the world spirit power that belonged to Eggy began to rush out from his palm and enter through the Sima Villa villa master’s wrist into his body.

“Ahhh~~~~~”

With Chu Feng’s energy devouring his body from within, the Sima Villa’s villa master was unable to contain his pain anymore and began to shout hysterically as if his heart and lungs were being ripped apart.

At this moment, Chu Feng was devouring his source energy, he was ruthlessly, slowly, devouring his life.

The most frightening aspect was that as Chu Feng devoured his source energy, the Sima Villa’s villa master, a rank nine Martial King, was completely powerless. It was as if he were a weak little hare caught in the claws of a fierce tiger.

The only thing he could do was allow Chu Feng’s devouring energy to devastate his body and then enter into his bones to absorb his most important source energy. Other than screaming miserably, he was powerless to do anything else.

“You bastard! Everyone, attack him together, kill this animal.”

Seeing that their family’s head was being miserably tormented by Chu Feng, the crowd from the Sima Family were enraged. In anger, they actually grew courageous. Many of the Sima Family’s experts began to simultaneously launch attacks toward Chu Feng.

They were very smart. They knew that they were no match for Chu Feng so they decided to attack him from afar with martial skills.

The martial skills were gorgeous-looking. It was an extravagant sight to behold. However, each and every one of them contained a very powerful destructive might.

Yet, Chu Feng did not even bother to look at their attacks. Just like that, he stood where he was without moving. Only when the attacks were about to land on him did the lightning that covered his body begin to violently move about.

“Zzzzzzzzz” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

A strange sound was heard. Chu Feng actually devoured the frightening attacks of those martial skills. After that, a layer of lightning visible to the naked eye rushed forth from Chu Feng. Like a dragon, yet also like a whip made from lightning, it swept past the crowd and penetrated the bodies of thirteen individuals.

After the lightning went past, the bodies of those thirteen people all split open and blood began to splatter everywhere. They died before they could even utter a scream.

As for these thirteen individuals, they were the ones who had attacked Chu Feng with martial skills earlier. Unfortunately, not only were they unable to harm Chu Feng in the slightest, they had instead lost their lives to him because of that.

“This...”

When they saw what had happened to those thirteen people, although the people of the Sima Family were extremely angry, not a single one of them dared to attack Chu Feng. That was because, at this moment, their fear had greatly surpassed their anger.

Just like this, the Sima Villa villa master’s scream continued again and again in the palace hall. Even the people outside of the palace hall managed to hear the vivid screams. This caused the rest of the Sima Family to rush over to see what was happening. However, after they saw what had happened in the palace hall, their complexions all turned pale with fright and shock.

Finally, the Sima Villa villa master’s miserable screams began to go from loud to weak, and then completely disappeared. When he died, Chu Feng smashed his body into ten thousand pieces like he had done with the people before him.

At this moment, silence filled the inside and outside of the palace hall. The people of the Sima Family were all standing there as if they were petrified. They did not dare to even breathe loudly.

As for Chu Feng, he handed Sima Huolie’s remains to Sima Ying. Then, he said, “Take proper care of your grandfather’s remains, do not hand them over to another so easily again.”

“Mn,” Sima Ying nodded. As matters stood, she no longer had any idea as to what to do and had decided to listen to Chu Feng’s decisions.

“Let’s go, neither you nor your grandfather belong here. Such a filthy family, it’s better for you to not return here anymore,” Chu Feng continued.

“Mn,” Sima Ying nodded her head again. She turned around and prepared to leave.

However, right at this moment, a burst of hurried footsteps was heard. Finally, a woman’s figure appeared from the crowd. She pointed to Sima Ying and began to loudly rain curses upon her, “Sima Ying, you are the messenger of death, not only did you cause the death of your parents and your grandfather, you even killed my husband, the Sima Family’s head and your numerous elders! You are simply not a human! You’re totally an animal!”
