Chapter 2642 - The Final Dawn

“Sure enough, there’s an issue. That is simply not a formation capable of increasing everyone’s cultivation. Instead, that is a demonic formation.”

“That formation is currently extracting everyone’s souls.”

At that moment, Ying Mingchao and the others that were imprisoned were finally able to understand the intention of the Infant Soul Sect.

Everyone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm had been deceived. The Infant Soul Grand Formation that they had looked forward to, the Infant Soul Grand Formation that brought them all together, was simply not a formation capable of helping them increase their cultivations.

Instead, it was a formation that extracted their souls and lives.

“Nooo!!!!”

“Eeaaahhh!!!!!!!!”

The miserable screams grew louder and louder. They filled the entire region. It was as if screams were resonating through the entire vast land of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

It was an incomparably mournful sound.

At that moment, the people who were covered by the dark black gaseous flames started to struggle violently.

However, they seemed to already be powerless. Even though it could be seen that they were struggling violently, not even a single person was able to break free from the dark black gaseous flames.

Just like that, they continued to have their souls extracted by the Infant Soul Grand Formation.

“This is truly too cruel. This Infant Soul Sect is actually planning to refine all the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”

At that moment, Grandmaster Pocket and many others were unable to continue watching. After all, such a scene was truly too miserable.

This was especially true for the monks like Grandmaster Pocket. Pitiful expressions filled their faces.

“Humph, those fools have wished for our deaths. They had forgotten about everything at the first sign of potential benefits.”

“What’s happening right now is for the best. They deserve it. Their deaths are their own fault.”

Zhao Hong said with an expression of hatred on her face. She was not a merciful person like Grandmaster Pocket.

All she knew was that when they, the allied army, fought for the sake of those people, they were betrayed by them. Then, they were insulted and held in contempt by them. She knew very well what sort of people they were.

“That’s right, those ignorant bastards deserve to die.”

What Zhao Hong said gained the approval of the great majority of the people from the allied army.

If it was before, they would definitely grieve upon seeing this sort of thing. After all, those were all living people.

However now, after they were betrayed by them, after they were spoken ill of and humiliated by them, after they witnessed those people’s true natures, they no longer felt any sympathy for those people. Instead, they only felt that the suffering of those people satisfied their hatred.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, an ear-piercing explosion suddenly sounded from the distant sky.

Looking toward the direction of the sound, the crowd was able to see that a golden light was rapidly approaching. One should know that that entire region had already been covered by the dark black gaseous flames. That entire region was already pitch black.

Thus, the sudden appearance of a golden ray of light like that was particularly eye-catching.

As that golden light grew closer and closer, the area covered by the golden light started to expand more and more.

It was as if what was approaching was a sun that was once again illuminating the earth.

“That is?”

Suddenly, Ying Mingchao and the others revealed a change in expression. The reason for that was because they discovered that the source of the golden radiance was a sword.

It was an enormous golden sword that reached several hundred meters long.

That golden sword was shining brightly with golden light. Although the size of the sword was still insignificant when compared to the dark black gaseous flames that filled the entire region, that sword was shining with golden light and extraordinary dominance. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As it passed, even the dark black gaseous flames started to squirm violently. It was as if they were trembling in fear.

Most importantly, on that enormous golden sword stood a figure.

As for that person... his clothes and hair were fluttering in the wind.

As the golden radiance was simply too dazzling, they were actually unable to see that person’s appearance clearly.

However, for that person to appear at such a time and with such golden light, it was like dawn appearing during an apocalypse. Looking at him, one would start to feel hope in one’s heart.

“Chu Feng! Look! It’s C-Chu Feng! It’s my B-Brother Chu Feng!!!”

Suddenly, Wang Qiang shouted sutteringly. Even though his face was already mutilated, one could still feel the joy that he felt at that moment.

“Chu Feng! It’s Chu Feng! It really is Chu Feng!!!”

After verifying that it was Chu Feng, everyone in the allied army grew incomparably overjoyed.

After all, Chu Feng was someone who they all cared deeply about. While being able to be saved was one thing, Chu Feng’s appearance at such a time also informed them that he was still alive.

As such, how could they not be in joy?

“Chu Feng? Why would he come now?”

Upon seeing Chu Feng, The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster spoke with a displeased tone. He felt that Chu Feng’s arrival would be a thorny problem.

He was able to sense how powerful Chu Feng was. Although Chu Feng’s aura was only that of a rank one True Immortal, the enormous golden sword he was standing on was giving off an extremely powerful aura.

Most importantly, he was wholly concentrated on the operation of the Infant Soul Grand Formation. As such, there was no way for him to fight Chu Feng. If he were to fight Chu Feng, this Infant Soul Grand Formation would have to cease operating.

At that moment, Chu Feng also noticed the situation with the Infant Soul Grand Formation. However, he did not even bother to pay attention to it. Instead, he directly rushed toward Ying Mingchao and the others.

The Ancient Era’s War Sword shot through the sky and directly shattered the prison cell that Ying Mingchao and the others were trapped in.

After the prison cell was destroyed, Ying Mingchao, Wang Qiang and the others, all being seriously injured, lost the ability to fly and started falling toward the surface.

“Buzz~~~”

However, right after they started descending, a layer of gentle power caught them. It was a grand spirit formation.

After Chu Feng caught them with his grand spirit formation, he did not bother with the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the grand spirit formation and started to set up a healing formation.

After an hour passed, a healing formation was completed. It covered everyone in the allied army.

The badly mutilated bodies of the crowd that were in the grand spirit formation floating in midair started to heal, and soon returned to their original appearances.

Furthermore, the expressions of pain on their faces also lessened greatly. Even the dark black gaseous flames were being expelled.

“Chu Feng, my d-dear brother, I k-knew t-th-that you w-were still alive. S-Sure enough, y-you’re alive.”

Wang Qiang was extremely overjoyed. Even though he was still extremely weak, he rushed limping toward Chu Feng and grabbed Chu Feng by the shoulder. He began to pat Chu Feng’s shoulder and size him up repeatedly.

“Your cultivation actually increased to rank two True Immortal? This progression speed is simply too fast, no?” Chu Feng was extremely happy to see the progress that Wang Qiang had made.

Actually, Chu Feng was feeling extremely happy. Even though the people from the allied army appeared to be in a miserable state, their injuries were only superficial.

None of them had suffered any fatal injuries. This could be said to be great fortune among misfortune.

“O-of course. A-After all, I’m a g-ge-genius,” Wang Qiang revealed a proud expression upon hearing those words. He added, “That s-said, y-you’re pretty decent too, brother.”

Wang Qiang’s was naturally talking about Chu Feng’s cultivation of rank one True Immortal.

Most importantly, even though Chu Feng’s cultivation was that of a rank one True Immortal, the aura of the Ancient Era’s War Sword controlled by Chu Feng had already surpassed that of a rank one True Immortal. It was truly a heaven-defying method.

“Brother Chu Feng, it’s truly great that you’re fine. We have been worried to death for you.”

At that moment, Ying Mingchao, Zi Xunyi and everyone else from the allied army all dragged their weak bodies, arrived before Chu Feng and surrounded him.

Chu Feng’s appearance not only informed them that he was safe and sound, but the power that Chu Feng revealed also made them feel a sense of security.

Although Chu Feng was only a rank one True Immortal, the aura Chu Feng emitted caused them to feel at ease.

This was especially true for the aura of that Ancient Era’s War Sword. It was even greater than Wang Qiang from before.

This meant that the current Chu Feng was most definitely capable of contending against the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

Thus, Chu Feng’s arrival was like the dawn of hope to them.

Not only was this dawn of hope capable of possibly saving them, it might also be capable of beating back the black gaseous flames that filled the sky and rescuing the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.
