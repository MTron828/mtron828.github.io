Chapter 5592: What a God Armament is Worth

The spear was the Golden Wings Fire God Spear, a gift from the Totem Dragon Clan’s Long Xu.

Chu Feng had two other God Armaments in his possession, which he had stolen from the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan’s prodigies in the Immemorial Star Sea’s formation. It was just that those God Armaments were exclusive to the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan’s usage, not to mention that they had distinctive traits and he had obtained them through improper channels.

He was worried that those from the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild would refuse those two God Armaments out of fear of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, so he chose to take out the one from the Totem Dragon Clan instead.

According to Long Xu, the Golden Wings Fire God Spear was a superior weapon among the Totem Dragon Clan’s God Armaments. While Chu Feng was unable to use it due to the Silver Dragon Spear’s seal, this limitation was only specific to him. Other cultivators were still able to use it, so its value was bound to be far higher than his other God Armaments.

Naturally, the Golden Wings Fire God Spear would be worth a lot more sycees.

In truth, Chu Feng knew that he was likely making a mountain out of a molehill by bringing the Golden Wings Fire God Spear out here, but with Little Fishy’s life at stake here, he would rather err on the safer side and ensure that he clinched the Blood Gathering Red Lotus.

“Young hero, where did you obtain this God Armament from?” The female receptionist looked at Chu Feng’s God Armament with a doubtful look in her eyes.

“Where I obtained it from has nothing to do with you. Surely you should recognize the value of this weapon, right?” Chu Feng took a more forceful attitude than before upon realizing that the woman was doubting him.

She was likely suspecting whether the God Armament was truly authentic, followed by whether it was obtained through proper channels.

“I most definitely recognize it, but…”

“But what? Are you going to disallow me from trading it for sycees?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course not! It’s just that this treasure is worth so much that I can’t make the call on this. Young master, please follow me,” the female receptionist said as she brought Chu Feng to a more extravagant guest room.

She took her leave before returning with an old man a moment later.

The old man casually glanced at the God Armament before earnestly assessing Chu Feng and asking with a gentle voice, “Young hero, are you Chu Feng?”

“Young hero, are you Chu Feng?” the old man asked with a gentle voice.

“That’s right. Elder, do you know me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I am Ma Qiang, the manager of this branch. I have heard about your feats on Painter Mountain, and it’s my honor to meet you today,” Ma Qiang stepped forward and bowed to Chu Feng after verifying the latter’s identity.

“It hasn’t been long since the events at Painter Mountain, but that old man already knows about it? As expected of the manager!” Eggy remarked.

“Indeed.” Chu Feng nodded in agreement before asking the elder, “Elder, may I exchange this God Armament for your guild’s sycees?”

“If my eyes don’t fail me, this must be the Totem Dragon Clan’s Golden Wings Fire God Spear,” the elder replied.

“You have a good eye for treasures, elder,” Chu Feng replied, not expecting the elder to know the origin of the God Armament. To dispel the latter’s doubts, he added, “I received this weapon as a gift from the Totem Dragon Clan.”

The elder appeared to have guessed as much, as he wasn’t too surprised by the revelation. Nevertheless, he continued to examine Chu Feng with a deepening smile, as he asked, “Young hero Chu Feng, I heard that you are here for the Blood Gathering Red Lotus?”

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

“As valuable as the Blood Gathering Red Lotus is, you don’t need to trade such an invaluable God Armament in for it,” the elder replied.

“Elder, how many sycees can this God Armament be exchanged for?” Chu Feng asked.

“Most God Armaments are worth fifty million sycees, but young hero Chu Feng’s Golden Wings Fire God Spear is of higher quality, so I’d estimate that it’s worth sixty million sycees,” the elder said.

This meant that the Golden Wings Fire God Spear was equivalent to the value of sixty million ordinary Exalted Armaments. This was how ridiculous the value difference between Exalted Armaments and God Armaments was.

However, Chu Feng wasn’t surprised to hear that.

While Exalted Armaments were considered invaluable treasures in the Eastern Region, most major powers in the world of cultivation were still in possession of them. In contrast, there were hardly any God Armaments in the world of cultivation. Even powerhouses like the Totem Dragon Clan only had a limited supply of them.

Given so, it was not surprising that it was worth this sum of money.

Chu Feng didn’t know the market price, but he thought that the elder’s estimate was reasonable.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Young hero Chu Feng, you don’t need to trade in your God Armament to auction for the Blood Gathering Red Lotus. If you trust me, you can leave your God Armament with me, and I’ll lend you a Distinguished Token,” the elder said as he passed a token to Chu Feng.

“You can report any price you wish as long as you have this token in hand. All you have to do is to trade us an item of equivalent value to the sum you spent in the auction. Of course, you are free to auction for other items that interest you as well, as we can settle them afterward.”

“Thank you, elder,” Chu Feng accepted the token before handing the Golden Wings Fire God Spear to the elder.

Surprisingly, the elder pushed the God Armament back, saying, “Young hero Chu Feng, you may keep it.”

“Don’t you need it as a deposit?” Chu Feng asked.

“We’ll take it as a deposit as long as young hero Chu Feng is still in our Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild,” the elder replied with a smile.

“I’m grateful for your trust, elder,” Chu Feng said.

He knew that the elder had granted him such privileges because the latter saw something in him, but nevertheless, it improved his impression of the elder. Not everyone would regard him highly just because he had accomplished outstanding feats in the past, which was why he never took others’ kindness for granted, whether they had an ulterior motive or not, as long as they were sincere about it.

The elder personally brought Chu Feng to the auction’s distinguished guest room.

The distinguished guest room was a room with glass walls that provided an overview of the auction hall. Ten beautiful attendants were on standby in the room, ready to fulfill the guest’s every need. This environment was a lot more comfortable than the crowded auction hall.

“Young hero Chu Feng, it’s unfortunate that we have disseminated information regarding the Blood Gathering Red Lotus being in today’s auction, or else we could have sold it to you at the lowest price. However, not many people will be competing over the Blood Gathering Red Lotus, so it’s unlikely that you’d have to pay an exorbitant price for it,” the elder said.

Those words showed his desire to do Chu Feng a favor and directly sell the Blood Gathering Red Lotus to him, but he couldn’t do so due to the rules.

“Elder, you have already helped me enough,” Chu Feng replied.

“Our Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild believes in making friends, and I believe that young hero Chu Feng is someone whom our guild has to befriend,” the elder said with a smile.

He was relaying to Chu Feng his desire to get on good terms with him because he had high regard for his potential. Chu Feng clasped his fist and responded with a polite smile.
