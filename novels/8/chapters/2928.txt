“Senior, are you talking about the Goldenstone Royal Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

“Precisely. Although I do not know the reason why, they seem to have come here for you.”

“That said, little friend Chu Feng, you do not have to worry. As long as you remain in our Ghost Sect Hall, they will definitely not dare to attack you,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master was extremely confident when he said those words.

Chu Feng felt that the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master should be a rank nine Martial Immortal. Even though he was a peak Martial Immortal, it remained that he was only a Martial Immortal.

The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief, on the other hand, was an extremely powerful Exalted-level expert.

At that moment, Chu Feng came to the realization that the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master most definitely possessed some sort of backing. As for that backing, it was so powerful that not even the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief would dare to attack Chu Feng inside the Ghost Sect Hall.

The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief had not directly attacked Chu Feng at the auction hall earlier because he was afraid of the Ghost Sect Hall.

“This junior appreciates senior’s kind intentions. Merely, if he truly wanted to take care of me, I’m afraid that it would not be that easy for him to do so either,” Chu Feng spoke in a very confident manner.

“It would appear that little friend Chu Feng either possesses certainty of being able to escape a calamity, or does not place him in his eyes at all.”

“It is no wonder that would handle the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s youngest prince without any fear,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master suddenly smiled.

It could be seen that the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master had been there the entire time; he knew all that Chu Feng had experienced.

That said, his deduction was correct. While Chu Feng did not not place the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief in his eyes, Chu Feng did possess certainty of being able to escape. Those ultimate concealment talismans Chu Feng possessed were no small matter. Should he use them, not even Exalted-level experts would be able to detect him.

Not to mention the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Clan Chief waiting for Chu Feng to leave in the shadows, even if he were openly waiting for Chu Feng at the Ghost Sect Hall’s entrance, he would not be able to capture Chu Feng. The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s concealment talisman would allow him to pass without being detected.

After chatting for some time, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master personally settled the bill for the Grand Auction Assembly for Chu Feng.

Not only had Chu Feng sold the Inherited Secret Skill from the Swordking City, he also sold many other treasures in the auction. In fact, he had even managed to sell the three completely useless flowers for an enormous price.

Chu Feng had managed to gain an enormous profit. It would not even be excessive to say that Chu Feng was extremely wealthy at the moment.

“Senior, the amount of Immortal Martial Stones you’ve given me is incorrect,” After receiving the Immortal Martial Stones, Chu Feng was surprised.

“Little friend Chu Feng, what is wrong with the amount?” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master asked.

“There’s too much.”

“You didn’t take a commission from the sales,” Chu Feng said.

Before Chu Feng had decided to auction the items with the Ghost Sect Hall, they had already agreed that the Ghost Sect Hall would take a portion of the sales as a commission.

However, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master had given Chu Feng all of the Immortal Martial Stones without taking his fee.

“Haha. Little friend Chu Feng, I’ve said it already. I am sincerely trying to befriend you. As such, we can just forget about the commission,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said with a smile.

“You must accept it,” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a portion of the Immortal Martial Stones and placed them in a Cosmos Sack. Then, he handed the Cosmos Sack to the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master.

“Little friend Chu Feng, there really is no need for this,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master naturally refused to accept it.

“Please accept this. Senior, if you consider me a friend, then please accept it. I, Chu Feng, am also sincerely trying to befriend you,” Chu Feng said.

The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master was startled. Then, he actually smiled again. That smile of his was a very cheerful smile. In the end, he did not attempt to say anything else, and accepted Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack.

The reason for that was because he was able to tell that Chu Feng possessed a very stubborn character. Likely, Chu Feng would refuse to allow him to refuse those Immortal Martial Stones.

“Senior, did that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram really end up being auctioned away?” Chu Feng asked.

Actually, before Chu Feng had even arrived, he had noticed that the grey-gowned mysterious individual at the auction hall down below had already left, together with the Ghost Sect Hall’s elders.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that that person was likely settling the bill. That said, was he really capable of paying fifty million Immortal Martial Stones?

“Speaking of that matter, we have truly encountered an extraordinary individual,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall master spoke with high emotions.

“In that case, it was truly purchased by someone for fifty million Immortal Martial Stones?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. Truth be told, I was also present in the auction hall. When someone bid fifty million Immortal Martial Stones, even I thought that person was deliberately causing trouble. That was why I ordered people to go and find that person.”

“Never would I have expected that person to actually take out fifty million Immortal Martial Stones,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“In that case, senior, do you know who that person is?” Chu Feng asked.

“I do not know who that person is. However, that person was most definitely an Exalted-level expert,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“Exalted-level expert?” Chu Feng’s expression changed. He truly had not expected to encounter two Exalted-level experts in the Grand Auction Assembly.

Furthermore, both Exalted-level experts had bidded against Chu Feng for the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.

At that moment, Chu Feng gasped with emotions. It would appear that actual treasures were truly in high demand.

With Chu Feng’s current level of cultivation, he would not even dare to say that he was the strongest among True Immortals. He was someone that Martial Immortal-level experts could easily slaughter with a wave of their hand.

As for Exalted-level experts, they were simply existences truly beyond his reach.

Likely, Exalted-level experts would be people capable of summoning the rain and calling on the wind in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

However, for the sake of obtaining the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, two of those sorts of existences had appeared. This was sufficient to show how valuable the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was.

“Actually, it is a good thing that little friend Chu Feng failed to win the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram. The Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram is at most worth ten million Immortal Martial Stones. Anything over that would not be worth it,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said. He was clearly trying to console Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng had failed to win it.

Chu Feng smiled faintly at the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master. In his heart, the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was worth forty million Immortal Martial Stones.

“If little friend Chu Feng is interested in that sort of treasure, this old man will help you pay attention to them. If another such treasure is to appear, I will definitely contact you,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“I will have to trouble senior then,” Chu Feng did not refuse this proposal from the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master.

After all, if he was truly capable of obtaining treasures like the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, it would mean that he had obtained an opportunity. What Chu Feng did not wish to miss the most would be opportunities.

“Lord Hall Master!”

Right at that moment, a shout was suddenly heard from outside the palace hall’s entrance.

That was a very cautious shout. However, it contained an intense amount of nervousness.

Still separated by the entrance, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said, “What happened?”

“Lord Hall Master, it’s something big!” That elder outside the entrance said.
