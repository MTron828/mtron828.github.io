Chapter 3086 - Overflowing With Light

“Brother Chu, your Chu Heavenly Clan is truly beloved by the heavens. Your Chu Heavenly Clan actually managed to have three exceptional geniuses appear in succession. This is truly worthy of celebration,” the Saintly Stellar Monk said to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief with his fist clasped.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief also clasped his fist in return. With a smile on his face, he said, “That is indeed our Chu Heavenly Clan’s fortune.”

“That fortune of yours is something that makes people jealous,” Saintly Stellar Monk said.

After saying those words, he soared into the sky, slowly walked in the air and arrived on the battle stage, landing before Chu Feng.

“This junior pays his respects to Saintly Monk,” Chu Feng hurriedly greeted the Saintly Stellar Monk respectfully.

“Little friend Chu Feng, there is no need for you to stand on ceremony. Did you know that the person that I wanted to see the most in coming here today was you?” the Saintly Stellar Monk said.

“Thank you for your compliment, senior,” Chu Feng said.

“It is not really a compliment. Rather, your grandfather and your father are truly too amazing.”

“That is why I wanted to see what their descendant would be like.”

“Seeing your performance today, you are truly qualified to be Chu Hanxian’s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” the Saintly Stellar Monk said.

Hearing what the Saintly Stellar Monk said, many people of the younger generation revealed admiring and envious gazes. However, they knew very well that the only person present that could obtain such praise from Saintly Stellar Monk was Chu Feng.

“Senior is flattering me,” Chu Feng said.

“To be able to remain modest even with strong power is truly a rare virtue,” the Saintly Stellar Monk praised.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled embarrassedly. He said, “Senior, when this junior was fighting against the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations earlier, I was not modest.”

“That doesn’t count. One should always oppose one’s opponent with equal harshness in a battle. Even verbal insults are a sort of psychological attack. One cannot be modest in such a setting.”

“To be truly modest means that one will not act arrogant after winning,” the Saintly Stellar Monk said.

“Thank you for your advice, senior,” Chu Feng smiled.

“Little friend Chu Feng, this old man has a present for you today,” the Saintly Stellar Monk said.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, the Saintly Stellar Monk waved his sleeve. Then, the Fire Qilin Armor that he had presented to Chu Zhiyuan earlier was forcibly removed from him.

The enormous power that removed the Fire Qilin Armor caused Chu Zhiyuan to tumble to the ground. When he stopped, he lay there with a very sorry appearance.

“Little friend, this armor was something that I was planning to give to the most outstanding person of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generation.”

“As for you, you evidently do not meet my requirements. As such, I am going to give this armor to Chu Feng instead. Are you willing to accept that?” the Saintly Stellar Monk said to Chu Zhiyuan.

Chu Zhiyuan was already powerless to defend himself. As such, how could he dare go against the Saintly Stellar Monk’s desire?

Merely, being stripped of something that he was already wearing caused him to feel a scorching pain on his face.

To him, this day was simply a nightmare.

It would not even be excessive to say that he had fallen from the heavens to hell.

Encountering such an enormous shock, the corner of Chu Zhiyuan’s mouth started to twitch. Then, his body started shaking, and his mouth turned askew. After that, he fainted.

Chu Zhiyuan actually fainted from being unable to endure the shock.

“Zhiyuan!”

This scene greatly frightened Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather. He immediately arrived before Chu Zhiyuan to diagnose his injuries.

“Rest assured, he has merely fainted. It is not a danger to his life.”

“However, my words will concern your lives,” at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke.

Once Chu Feng said those words, Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather, Chu Haoyan’s grandfather, Chu Ruoshi and Chu Haoyan all shivered. Then, they looked to Chu Feng with dejected expressions.

How could they have forgotten that Chu Feng currently controlled their lives, and could end them with a word if he wanted to?

At that moment, everyone turned their eyes to Chu Feng. Many among them even held their breath, fearing to even breathe loudly.

Now that the foreign enemies had been beaten back, it was time for Chu Feng to settle things with him internal enemies.

Everyone was wondering how Chu Feng would handle these shameless clansmen that went as far as to use despicable methods in order to harm him.

Suddenly, Chu Feng looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, clasped his fist and said, “Lord Clan Chief, I only have a single request. I want their lives to be spared. As for their punishment, Lord Clan Chief can decide.”

“What?”

“Chu Feng actually wants to keep them alive?”

Chu Feng’s words were completely unexpected.

Even Chu Ruoshi and the others had not expected Chu Feng to say this sort of thing.

After all, what they’d done to Chu Feng was simply deplorable, and should be punished with death.

Since Chu Feng held authority over their lives, practically everyone, including they themselves, felt that Chu Feng would definitely order their deaths. The only difference was how they would die, and what sort of torture they would suffer before their deaths.

No one expected that Chu Feng would actually let them live.

At that moment, even Her Lady Queen turned to ask Chu Feng in a confused manner, “Chu Feng, why aren’t you planning to kill them?”

“If I am to kill them, it will be letting them off too easily.”

“I want them to live and witness my growth with their own eyes. I want them to witness me growing to a state where they fear me, a state that they do not wish to see.”

“At that time, I will be able to take their lives at any moment. They will have to worry about being killed by me day and night. Forever, they will live in fear of me, unable to sleep in peace,” Chu Feng said.

“Boy, never would I imagined you to have this sort of trick in mind. If that’s the case, this Queen will stand in favor of you not killing them,” Her Lady Queen said.

No one was able to hear the conversation between Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen. Thus, no one knew what Chu Feng’s real intention was.

Chu Feng was definitely not being lenient. Instead, he wanted them to suffer even more. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Chu Feng, are you certain of that?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

His reaction was very calm. Compared to the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen, he seemed to not be very surprised by Chu Feng’s response.

“Lord Clan Chief, this junior is certain,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief nodded. Then, he waved his sleeve, and boundless martial power spinkled down. His martial power turned into four golden chains that flew out from his cuff.

The golden chains began flying toward Chu Haoyan’s grandfather, Chu Zhiyuan’s grandfather, Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi.

By the time the crowd noticed the golden chains, the golden chains had already tightly bound the four of them.

After being bound by the chains, the aura of the four were completely suppressed. Furthermore, their faces turned extremely pale, and they directly fell onto their stomachs.

At that moment, they resembled people without cultivation. They were unable to bring forth any power at all. They were no different from cripples.

“Zhengfa, punish the four of them severely according to our clan’s laws. Remember... all you have to do is to keep them slightly alive,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said to Chu Xuanzhengfa.

“Yes, Milord,” Chu Xuanzhengfa clasped his fist in response.

Then, he ordered his men from the Law Enforcement Hall to arrest the four of them.

“Well then, everyone, this Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition shall come to an end here. Chu Zhiyuan has trained in a demonic technique, and had an unfair advantage in the contest. As such, his performance is invalid.”

“As for who the number one individual in this Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition really is, I believe there is no need for this old man to state it,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled.

“Chu Feng!”

Once the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, there were immediately shouts of Chu Feng’s name.

The person who first shouted out Chu Feng’s name was Ying Mingchao.

To the people present, Ying Mingchao was a stranger.

However, no one felt any antipathy toward his shout. In fact, the crowd even began to echo his shout.

Soon, both the people of the younger generation and the people of the older generation were all shouting Chu Feng’s name. Their shouting was like thunder exploding in the sky.

At that moment, many of the people present were feeling very joyous. This was especially true for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. They felt extremely proud to have a person like Chu Feng among their ranks.

However, there were also people with faces covered in unease.

They were Chu Haoyan and Chu Hanyu.

There was no need to mention Chu Haoyan. His grandfather had been arrested. One could very well imagine what he was feeling now.

As for Chu Huanyu, he was someone who was determined to avenge his father. However, seeing the current Chu Feng, how was he supposed to avenge his father?

That said, there was more than just those two people among the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clansmen that were feeling depressed.

There was another person. Her name was Chu Yue.

Chu Yue was originally the person closest to Chu Feng in the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, for the sake of her own self-interest, she betrayed Chu Feng.

And now, Chu Feng was overflowing with light and enjoying praises from the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Yet, she no longer had any relationship with Chu Feng.

All she had was endless remorse.
