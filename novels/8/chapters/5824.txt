Chapter 5825: Special Treatment

“This is bad!” Xianhai Shoayu suddenly exclaimed just as they reached the entrance of the auction hall.

“What’s wrong, Brother Shaoyu?” Chu Feng asked.

“Brother Chu Feng, do you have treasures that you can use as a deposit without revealing your identity? We plan to get a normal compartment room, but even that requires a deposit to exchange for the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s sycees. Most of my treasures bear the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s insignia, and it wouldn’t be a wise idea to bring out those from the Huangfu Heavenly Clan,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Don’t worry, I have a solution,” Chu Feng replied as he took out a token.

The last time he participated in the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s auction, Manager Ma had gifted him a Distinguished Token. It granted him the privilege to attend any auction without placing any deposit, and he could bid any amount of money in the auction and pay for it later on. It could be used in any Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild.

“Woah! As expected of Brother Chu Feng!” Xianhai Shaoyu’s eyes lit up upon seeing the token.

He had this token too, but it was reserved for the Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen. It served as a symbol of their identity, which meant that using it would reveal their identity. On the other hand, Chu Feng’s token could be used even without him revealing his identity, making it more useful.

“We can enter straight without paying a deposit with this token,” Xianhai Shaoyu said as he led Chu Feng and Little Fishy to the front of the auction hall.

There were ten people or so standing at the entrance of the auction hall, and they were all dressed in world spiritist cloaks. Their cloaks were rough with rucksacks, and they didn’t reveal their spirit power either.

As soon as Xianhai Shaoyu overtook them to the front, a person from the group suddenly shouted, “Go and queue up.”

It was an old man’s voice, and the voice held great power. It didn’t harness oppressive might, but it was intimidating nevertheless. He had to be either a True God level cultivator or a True Dragon World Spiritist.

“My apologies.” Xianhai Shaoyu didn’t lose his temper. Instead, he dragged Chu Feng back to the queue. “I’m so used to entering the auction hall straight that I forgot about the queue. My apologies.”

Chu Feng was impressed.

Xianhai Shaoyu was the son of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief, and they were in one of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s territories. Anyone else in Xianhai Shaoyu’s place would have never tolerated such disrespect.

Yet, Xianhai Shaoyu wasn’t displeased. He even apologized for it despite the other party’s fierce attitude. It was rare for someone of his standing to be so magnanimous.

“Please wait a moment.” The elder guarding the auction’s entrance ran up to Chu Feng’s group with a warm smile, his eyes focused on Chu Feng’s Distinguished Token. He quickly verified the token before turning to Chu Feng. “A warmest welcome to our three distinguished guests. Are you here to attend the auction?”

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

“This way please,” the elder said as he led them into the auction hall.

“Are you blind? Can’t you see we’re still here? Why are you letting them in first?” another person in the group exclaimed with an even more enraged voice. It was a young man.

“My apologies, but these three guests have our Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s Distinguished Token. They are entitled to special privileges,” the elder spoke with a courteous smile before leading the way for Chu Feng’s group.

Naturally, Chu Feng and the others didn’t return to the queue but instead followed the elder. Queuing up was part of the rules, but the privileges they had were also a part of the rules set by the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild. There was nothing wrong with them enjoying it.

Had the world spiritists politely told them to queue up instead, Chu Feng wouldn’t have minded waiting. However, their attitude had been rude. Chu Feng had met many people, and from their attitude, he could tell that they were unlikely to be good people.

There was no reason for him to forgo their privilege for their sake.

As Chu Feng walked past them, one of the world spiritists murmured, “What lousy Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild is this? How dare they look down on us? I’ll have my father destroy them when I return.”

The elder smiled, not thinking much of the matter. It was common for them to hear such words, and the elder was already used to it.

Soon, Chu Feng’s group arrived at one of the distinguished compartments. It was very spacious, looking more like a palace than anything else. There were all kinds of desserts and fruits placed all around, and beautiful maids stood on standby.

“Have them leave,” Chu Feng instructed.

“All right.” The elder waved his hand, and the beautiful maids obediently left the room.

“Please hold on. The auction is about to start. I’ll station my men outside. Feel free to ask anything from them,” the elder said before taking his leave.

“Not bad, Brother Chu Feng. You have connections with the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild. This distinguished room is second only to the exclusive compartment used by our Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Let me have a look at your token. There must be something special about it, or else they wouldn’t have arranged such a grand room for you,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Chu Feng passed his Distinguished Token over as he replied, “It’s probably just a coincidence. The elder who gave me the token shouldn’t wield that much authority. This token should be the limit of his authority.”

“I can’t see through its secret, but my gut feeling tells me this token is not normal. The elder wouldn’t have been so respectful if it was a normal Distinguished Token. Brother Chu Feng, can you tell me the name of the person who gave you this token?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“Ma Qiang, Manager Ma,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ma Qiang?” Xianhai Shaoyu racked his mind for important figures in the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild, but he couldn’t remember anyone named Ma Qiang.

Little Fishy picked up two red apples and passed one to Chu Feng. “Have one, big brother.”

Chu Feng took one of the apples. She smiled sweetly before taking a bite of hers.

“Where’s mine?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“Don’t you have hands?” Little Fishy sat down on the chair, showing no inclination to take one for her elder brother.

“Tsk!” Xianhai Shaoyu waved his hand, and a tangerine flew into his hand. He settled down on one of the chairs too.

Before them was a transparent barrier that allowed them to see the huge auction stage.

“Brother Shaoyu, who were those people earlier?” Chu Feng asked.

“I never met them before. I don’t think they are from our Immortal Sea Galaxy,” Xianhai Shaoyu replied.

“There’s something special about their world spiritist cloaks. They must be from a major power,” Chu Feng said.

“Oh? Is it formidable?” Xianhai Shaoyu asked.

“They are specially crafted treasures. They are worth a lot,” Chu Feng replied.
