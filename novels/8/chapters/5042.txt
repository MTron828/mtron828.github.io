Chapter 5042: His Goal

Chu Feng and the others had left the Nine Souls Sacred Clan and were currently aboard a warship, traveling through an ancient teleportation formation. It was the escape route that Chu Feng had designed in advance.

His opponents were simply too strong that he had to ensure that they were able to leave the vicinity of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan as soon as possible.

On the warship, Princess Xiaoxiao was currently kneeling in front of him with a tear-stained face.

“Chu Feng, I’m begging you. Please save my father and my family! I know that I’ve done you wrong, and I’m willing to do anything to make amends as long as you help me. You can take my life if you want to!”

Princess Xiaoxiao had witnessed with her own eyes how Sima Xiangtu defeated her father and imprisoned him. She knew deep well that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was in peril, and her clan members would be massacred at this rate.

However, she was powerless to reverse the situation.

Sima Xiangtu’s tremendous strength was already difficult to deal with, but that Pill Dao Immortal Sect was like an insurmountable mountain crushing over the Nine Souls Galaxy, not allowing them to catch a breather at all.

With even the Godwish Grandmother and the Sagacious Grandmaster falling in defeat, it was possible that there was no one else in the Nine Souls Galaxy who could curb Sima Xiangtu anymore.

Of everyone she knew, the only one who might just be able to pull it off was Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had the backing of many experts, such as the Godwish Grandmother and the Holy Light Clan.

However, before Chu Feng could answer her, Shengguang Baimai had already lashed out.

“You wench, do you have no sense of shame? How dare you ask young hero Chu Feng for a favor? In the first place, your Nine Souls Sacred Clan was the one who trapped young hero Chu Feng’s friend inside your soul! Why in the world should he help you?

“In my view, your Nine Souls Sacred Clan deserves to die. The calamity you’re facing right now might just be divine retribution!” Shengguang Baimei spat.

“Elder Baimei, that’s enough.”

Chu Feng stopped Shengguang Baimei with a wave of his hand. He then stepped forward and personally helped Princess Xiaoxiao up.

“I have an irreconcilable grudge with Sima Xiangtu. No matter what it takes, I’ll kill him with my own hands. As for you, I only hope that you’ll fully cooperate with me if I’m able to find a way to save Miaomiao. I’ll also find a way to cure your illness,” Chu Feng said.

Princess Xiaoxiao was stunned. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Chu Feng was telling her that he would turn a blind eye to her previous betrayal.

“Chu Feng, I…”

Princess Xiaoxiao began sobbing even harder than before with guilt written all over her face.

“Now is not the time to cry. Crying won’t solve anything,” Chu Feng said.

He had already taken another look at Princess Xiaoxiao’s soul. While Xian Miaomiao was still unconscious inside Princess Xiaoxiao’s soul, she wasn’t in any danger for the time being.

He could also understand why Princess Xiaoxiao didn’t help him to suppress Sima Xiangtu back then. She didn’t know Sima Xiangtu’s true face back then, and she could tell that he was prioritizing Xian Miaomiao’s survival over hers. It was only natural for her to side with Sima Xiangtu for her own survival.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, you have been by Sima Xiangtu’s side for a while now. Do you know what he’s scheming?” Chu Feng asked.

“I really didn’t know that Yin Ren was plotting something like this. However, your master did tell me some things,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.

“My master?” Chu Feng asked.

“Even though Yin Ren has captured your master, he intentionally allowed your master to see what he has been doing all this while. Due to that, your master has some clues as to what Yin Ren is up to,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.

She began sharing what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had told her.

Sima Xiangtu’s goal didn’t come as a surprise to the crowd. In fact, it was the same as what Chu Feng had previously guessed.

Sima Xiangtu was hoping to use the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy to concoct something, just that it was no easy feat to pull it off. That was why he had to collude with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect and borrow their treasure, the Immortal Cauldron.

In exchange for that, Sima Xiangtu promised the Pill Dao Immortal Sect to supply them with a type of energy known as Soul Fog.

“Are the people from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect fools? Soul Fog is a legendary item! The Nine Souls Sacred Clan wasn’t able to find it for so many years, so how could Sima Xiangtu possibly secure it for them?” the Godwish Grandmother exclaimed in disbelief.

“What is Soul Fog?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s legendary energy that exists in the Nine Souls Galaxy. Back then, when countless powers were fighting over supremacy over this galaxy, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was able to rise to the top thanks to the power of Soul Fog.

“It’s just that Soul Fog is hidden in an obscure location in the galaxy, making it extremely difficult to acquire. In fact, even the current Nine Souls Sacred Clan has no way of finding and acquiring Soul Fog anymore.

“Too many years have passed since the era of Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s founder, such that Soul Fog has become nothing more than a legend. No one knows for sure whether it has truly existed before or not,” the Lady of Dao Sea explained.

“Isn’t there a member of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan here? She should know better than anyone whether Soul Fog really exists or not!” Shengguang Baimei said as he turned to look at Princess Xiaoxiao.

The others did the same too.

“Based on the historical records of our Nine Souls Sacred Clan, Soul Fog did exist for a period of time. It’s a green aura that’s hidden in the midst of our Nine Souls Galaxy, and it harnesses incredible power. All beings will tremble in its presence,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.

“Does it still exist now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Our Nine Souls Sacred Clan does have a recorded method to find Soul Fog, but it doesn’t work anymore. In fact, the inability to acquire Soul Fog is one of the key reasons why our Nine Souls Sacred Clan has gradually fallen into decline.

“In order to revitalize our Nine Souls Sacred Clan, our ancestors have tried all sorts of ways to find Soul Fog, but it was in vain. Eventually, the conclusion we came to was that Soul Fog did exist for a period of time, but our ancestors might have already depleted it dry,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.

“About what Sima Xiangtu is concocting using the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy, did my master say what will happen if he succeeds?” Chu Feng asked.

“Your master said that if Yin Ren succeeds, his cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds. It’s possible that even those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect won’t be able to curb him anymore,” Princess Xiaoxiao said.

The crowd could hardly stay calm after hearing those words.

To reach an extent where even the powerful Pill Dao Immortal Sect wouldn’t be able to curb, just how powerful would Sima Xiangtu be?
