Chapter 3114 - Tang Zhenghao

After hearing the voice of that elder, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief waved his sleeve and opened the entrance to the palace hall.

When the entrance to the palace hall was opened, an elder was seen kneeling outside.

“What happened?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Lord Clan Chief, it is the Tang Heavenly Clan’s Tang Zhenghao.”

“He arrived outside of our Chu Heavenly Clan and issued a challenge to Chu Feng,” That elder said.

“Tang Zhenghao? Why would he suddenly come to our Chu Heavenly Clan? Furthermore, how did he know about Chu Feng?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Arriving together with Tang Zhenghao was the Li Heavenly Clan’s Li Tianyou. In my opinion, that Tang Zhenghao was staying at the Li Heavenly Clan as a guest, and found out about Chu Feng defeating Li Anzhi. That was why he passed through the Upper Realm Gate and came to our Chu Heavenly Clan to challenge Chu Feng,” That elder said.

“So that’s the case. No wonder,” Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief narrowed his brows.

Seeing the frown on the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s face, Chu Feng knew that this fellow by the name of Tang Zhenghao possessed quite an origin. Thus, he asked, “Senior, who is this Tang Zhenghao?”

“Oh, that Tang Zhenghao is a young master of the Tang Heavenly Clan. It should be mentioned that the Tang Heavenly Clan is not only one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Ten Great Heavenly Clans, but they are also ranked ninth in terms of strength.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Coincidentally, Tang Zhenghao is not only the strongest member of the Tang Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, but he is also one of the Ancestral Martial Decastars. Furthermore, he just so happens to be ranked ninth on that list too, a rank above Li Anzhi.”

“That Tang Zhenghao had a pretty good relationship with Li Anzhi. Likely, he has come to obtain revenge for him,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“In that case, what is that Tang Zhenghao’s cultivation?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ve inspected it beforehand. Tang Zhenghao’s cultivation is the same as Li Anzhi’s; he is a rank seven Heavenly Immortal,” That elder said.

“If he’s a rank seven Heavenly Immortal, there’s nothing to be afraid of,” After finding out that Tang Zhenghao’s cultivation was that of a rank seven Heavenly Immortal, the heavy frown on the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s face started to unfold. He seemed to have relaxed. Then, he looked to Chu Feng. There was a look of anticipation in his eyes.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief wanted Chu Feng to accept the challenge.

Knowing the intention of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Feng immediately clasped his fist and said, “Senior, Chu Feng is willing to accept the challenge.”

“Very well. Chu Feng, you must know that our Chu Heavenly Clan is currently looked down upon by the various Heavenly Clans.”

“That is the reason why that Tang Zhenghao dares to come challenge you, knowing fully well that you have defeated Li Anzhi.”

“Using this opportunity, you can make even more people realize that a genius on par with Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan has emerged in our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“That said, Chu Feng, you must be careful when fighting Tang Zhenghao. After all, it was no luck that he was able to defeat Li Anzhi and be ranked ninth on the Ancestral Martial Decastars,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief warned Chu Feng sternly.

“This junior understands senior’s intentions. Please rest assured, this junior will definitely not lower his guard,” Chu Feng clasped his fist.

Then, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief personally brought Chu Feng over to the border of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Some Chu Heavenly Clansmen were already gathered here. There were also a lot of people gathered outside.

However, the great majority of the people were standing on the ground. Out of respect for the Chu Heavenly Clan, they did not dare to fly in the sky directly outside of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory.

There were two exceptions. They were two people of the younger generation. Not only were they standing in the sky, but neither of them were from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

One of them was Li Anzhi’s younger brother, Li Tianyou.

As for the other young man, he had delicate features. However, there was a nefarious smile on his face.

He was emitting the aura of a rank seven Heavenly Immortal with no scruples. Everyone was capable of sensing it.

Written on the title plate at his waist were the words ‘Tang Heavenly Clan’ revealing his noble status.

That man was none other than the strongest person among the Tang Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, the ninth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Tang Zhenghao.

At that moment, Tang Zhenghao and Li Tianyou were both pointing in the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan and shouting insults.

The content of their insults were mostly ridiculing Chu Feng.

Their insults were spoken very loudly, and resonated over many miles. It was precisely those insults that were attracting more and more people.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief carefully inspected Tang Zhenghao’s cultivation. After discovering that his cultivation was indeed that of a rank seven Heavenly Immortal, he nodded to Chu Feng.

As for Chu Feng, he immediately revealed himself, walked out of the boundary that separated the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory, and appeared before Tang Zhenghao.

“Chu Feng, you damn coward, you finally deign to show yourself?”

Upon seeing Chu Feng, Li Tianyou’s eyes immediately surged with killing intent.

He hated Chu Feng to the bone. If possible, he was simply itching to kill Chu Feng immediately.

“I immediately rushed over upon learning that you’ve come. How am I unwilling to show myself?”

“Li Tianyou, did I not teach you a sufficient lesson? Do you wish to be taught another lesson by me?” Chu Feng looked to Li Tianyou with a sneer on his face.

“Humph,” Li Tianyou snorted. Although he was extremely furious, he did not immediately argue with Chu Feng. Instead, he looked to Tang Zhenghao, who stood beside him.

“It would appear that you’re that Chu Feng. I have heard of your grandfather and father. They are seniors that I highly respect.”

“However, I wonder exactly how powerful you, their descendant, are,” Tang Zhenghao said to Chu Feng.

“You should’ve learned of how strong I am from Li Tianyou, no?” Chu Feng asked.
