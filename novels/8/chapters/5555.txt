Chapter 5555: Absolute Trust

“521, this matter is of grave importance…” the chief elder said.

However, Chu Feng decisively interjected, “Elder, I am confident that I can bring about a significant improvement to the formation armor after I’m done working on it.”

“Significant improvement? Engineer 521, you sound awfully confident. How much do you know about this formation armor? Do you know how many formations it is made up of? Do you know how these formations are linked together? Do you even understand how great and complicated this formation armor is?” the chief engineer said in a voice dripping with disdain.

However, the chief elder asked, “Are you sure about this? You’ll have to take responsibility if a mishap occurs. You might even lose your life.”

It was a warning to Chu Feng. Most people would have to stop and ponder about it, but Chu Feng didn’t hesitate in the least before replying, “I am willing to bear the consequences.”

The chief engineer sneered, but before he could turn down Chu Feng’s request, the chief elder stepped in and ordered, “Let him modify the formation armor.”

“Chief elder!!!”

The chief engineer could hardly believe what he had just heard. He wanted to protest against the order, but the chief elder’s attention wasn’t on him at all.

“521, feel free to state any request; I’ll accompany you here today. It should be obvious, but I’ll have to bear the consequences alongside you if you mess up Lord Xianhai Yu’er’s formation armor in any way,” the chief elder said.

Those words heaped pressure on Chu Feng, but it also gave him the confidence to do what he wanted to.

“I am deeply grateful for your trust in me, elder.”

Chu Feng stepped forward and began modifying the formation armor according to the ideas he had in mind. He had access to the spirit power reserve in this place, so the greatest bottleneck was not his own spirit power but his understanding of formations.

For that reason, the engineers here weren’t chosen based on their spirit power either, though it was clear that Chu Feng was still the weakest of them all.

The crowd was initially dubious about Chu Feng’s claims; most of them were waiting to see him make a joke of himself. However, the atmosphere in the crowd changed as soon as he began working on the formation armor. More and more people crowded around to take a closer look.

Even the elders who were going to take their leave chose to stay and watch on.

True professionals could immediately tell whether a person had substance or not. Chu Feng’s ability to maneuver the spirit power was so adept that one could hardly believe that this was the first time he was working on the formation armor.

Over time, the crowd’s astonishment only further deepened. At some point in time, the noisy surroundings turned deathly silent. The only sound to be heard was Chu Feng’s moving hands and the whirring of spirit power.

A smile slowly formed on the chief elder’s face. He knew that he had made the right bet. He had secured a formidable talent for the Star Sea Realm.

“This lad is incredible, but is he planning to do the modifications on the formation armor by himself?” the chief elder wondered.

It was not that Chu Feng couldn’t do it alone, but his ideas could be better implemented with the assistance of the other engineers. The only problem was that it would be harder to fine-tune the details with more people onboard. If he couldn’t properly command the others, it might backfire on him.

Due to that, the chief elder didn’t offer Chu Feng any suggestions but instead allowed him to do as he wished.

Shoosh!

Just then, Chu Feng waved his arms, and formation blueprints appeared before each of the engineers and maintenance staff. These formation blueprints were very detailed, explaining in depth what each of them should do and how they should coordinate with one another.

The elders glanced at one another before directing an awed look at the chief elder. The chief elder’s smile further deepened, as he looked at Chu Feng in pride.

Chu Feng’s formation blueprints were so perfect that they induced goosebumps for even a veteran like him. His instructions were so elaborate that even a fool could easily carry it out just by following them word for word, and there were no fools in this room at all.

Chu Feng had properly timed himself to ensure that all of the engineers and maintenance staff had ample time to digest the formation blueprints before stopping work. He turned to the crowd and politely bowed to them, saying, “I’ll be troubling you.”

The crowd immediately got to action.

Time slowly ticked, but none of the engineers or maintenance staff felt exhausted. If anything, they were getting increasingly excited, particularly the maintenance staff. This was the first time they were involved in the modification of the formation armor, after all. Even though they were taking on a supporting role here, they could feel that they were making a difference.

“Chief elder, where did you scour such a treasure? He’s incredible. None of us can match his understanding of formations!” some of the elders who were closer to the chief elder walked over and asked.

“I wouldn’t have allowed him to mess around at this crucial timing if he doesn’t have the capability to back his words,” the chief elder replied gleefully.

The crowd nodded in awe.

They were confused when the chief elder showed such great support for Chu Feng earlier, but it finally made sense to them now.

The formation armor was completed before daybreak. While it looked the same as before on the surface, those involved in the work knew that it was far stronger than before. They had reinforced all of the formations in the formation armor together with their linkages.

Soon, a middle-aged woman arrived on the grounds to collect the formation armor. She was another chief elder. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Elder 333, what are you doing here?” the female chief elder asked the chief elder standing beside Chu Feng.

333 was the chief elder’s name, though no one dared to call him by that name except for those of the same or higher rank than him.

“Elder 777, take a closer look at the formation armor,” the chief elder replied gleefully.

Perplexed, the female chief elder inspected the formation armor. Moments later, her eyes beamed with joy.

“You have worked hard.”

The female chief elder bowed to the chief elder before leaving with the formation armor in hand. She couldn’t wait to show the revamped formation armor to Xianhai Yu’er.

“You have worked hard, 521. You’ll be handsomely rewarded for your effort. You may head back and rest now,” the chief elder told Chu Feng with a smile.

He was certain that Xianhai Yu’er would be satisfied with the formation armor.

“Elder, I am not tired at all. I have a suggestion to make,” Chu Feng said.

“What is it?” the chief elder asked.

“Could you grant me some private time here alone?” Chu Feng sent a voice transmission to the chief elder.

“You want to stay here alone?” the chief elder replied via voice transmission.

He was surprised by Chu Feng’s request.

“You may stay here with me if you have reservations, but I hope that there aren’t too many eyes around,” Chu Feng said.

“What do you plan to do?” the chief elder asked.

“To be honest, the improvements I have just made on the formation armor are general in nature. I wish to construct a formation that will further elevate the formation armor, specifically tailoring it to Lord Xianhai Yu’er’s strengths. However, this will also expose the secret behind Lord Xianhai Yu’er’s bloodline, so I don’t want too many people to see it,” Chu Feng replied.

“All right,” the chief elder replied with a nod.

He issued an order for everyone to evacuate the area, and that no one should enter the premises without his permission. Soon, the only ones left in the room were him and Chu Feng.

“Do your best, 521. I’ll benefit from your halo if you do well,” the chief elder replied before taking his leave.

Astonishingly, he didn’t insist on staying on the premises, instead allowing Chu Feng to control all of the powerful formations here by himself. This showed his absolute trust in Chu Feng.
