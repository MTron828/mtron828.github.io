Chapter 4603: Divine Rejuvenation Pearl

“You want to live?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, we want to live!”

“Milord, please spare us. We really know our mistake now!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Those world spiritists cried pitifully as they kowtowed to Chu Feng again and again. No one would have believed that they were respected prodigies outside if they had seen their current appearances.

“Show it to me if you wish to live!”

Chu Feng glanced at their Cosmos Sacks with narrowed eyes.

Those world spiritists were sharp on their wits too. They immediately understood what Chu Feng was driving at. There were indeed many treasures in their Cosmos Sacks, but none of them was worth as much as their lives.

Without a shred of hesitation, they took out their Cosmos Sacks and threw it over to Chu Feng. Some of the more extreme ones even took out the treasures they had hidden in their bodies.

In order to live, they dared not to hold anything back.

“You handed these Cosmos Sacks over to me on your own obligation. I didn’t force you into anything. If you dare turn against me, don’t blame me for killing you.”

Chu Feng kept those treasures as he warned the crowd.

“We dare not to! We’ll never dare to stand against you!”

“Milord, please rest assured and take them. It’s our way of showing respect to you!”

Those people spoke with a seemingly earnest attitude.

Even though Chu Feng knew that they were only saying these in order to preserve their lives, he still nodded in satisfaction.

“Remember this, my name is Chu Feng, and I am from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,” Chu Feng told them.

“Ah, so it’s Lord Chu Feng. We have remembered your name, and we’ll never forget the graciousness you have shown us today!”

Even though Chu Feng had just robbed them, they still chanted Chu Feng’s name while thanking him. It was truly an ironic scene.

And in truth, Chu Feng spared their lives in order to let them know who he was. He had already offended the strongest Holy Light Clan back in the Holy Light Galaxy anyway, so he wasn’t afraid of offending the so-called prodigies of Nine Souls Clan anymore.

Rather than act all cowardly and cautiously in every situation, he might as well make use of this opportunity to make his name known to the world. That was also the reason why he had chosen to spare their lives.

Even if it wasn’t a good reputation, he was fine with it.

“This feeling?”

But all of a sudden, Chu Feng’s eyes widened a little. Following that, he turned around before abruptly vanishing from the spot.

Chu Feng’s sudden disappearance caught the crowd off guard. They were still traumatized by the sight they had seen, but they were also a little confused as to what was going on at the moment.

Did Chu Feng run away? But why would he suddenly run away?

In any case, it was a good thing that the demon was no longer around anymore. They heaved a sigh of relief, knowing that they had barely managed to survive a trip to hell.

As for Chu Feng, of course, he didn’t disappear all of a sudden to escape from those world spiritists. Rather, it was because he sensed the aura of a person—Song Yun.

Song Yun had an anxious look on her face, and she was frantically searching for something.

“Lass.”

Chu Feng appeared right before Song Yun and called out to her.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I’ve finally found you!”

Song Yun was excited to see Chu Feng too, and she immediately leaped into his embrace. Yet, despite her excitement, her body was trembling a little, and vaguely, Chu Feng could hear her weeping a little.

There were still traces of horror on her face.

It would appear that this environment was too pressurizing even for a fearless lass like her.

“Alright, don’t cry. Didn’t you find me in the end?” Chu Feng said with a smile as he wiped off Song Yun’s tears.

“I’m not crying! It’s just that... sand got into my eyes...

“Big brother Chu Feng, I was too weak. I tried my best to search for keys, but I could only find two of them. I won’t be able to enter the depths of the Incubation Forest with you anymore to lead the way. There are the places where the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl is likely to be, and I’ll have to trouble you to bring it back for me.

“However, if you face any danger, you must make sure to protect yourself well. Obtaining the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl is of secondary importance; your safety comes first!”

Song Yun said as she passed a map into Chu Feng’s hands.

There were various places demarcated on the map, but some of them were located in the heart of the Incubation Forest. One would have to pass through the barrier in order to access that region.

“Silly lass, let’s enter together.”

Chu Feng took a glance at the map before taking out the huge bunch of keys he had just looted.

“My gosh!! Big brother Chu Feng, this... You’re incredible! You actually managed to obtain so many keys?”

A smile bloomed on Song Yun’s face as soon as she saw the keys in Chu Feng’s hands.

Putting aside her and Chu Feng, the number of keys he had was enough for another five more of them to pass through the barriers!

“How can I get you to trust me if I can’t at least do that much?” Chu Feng said as he passed keys of five different elements over to Song Yun.

The two of them quickly made their way to the barrier, and with the keys they carried with them, they were able to pass through the barrier successfully to enter the deeper regions of the Incubation Forest.

Without any hesitation, they immediately headed to the places demarcated on the map to search for the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl.

All in all, there were ten locations marked on the map, but Chu Feng and Song Yun were lucky to find the whereabouts of the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl in the second place.

However, the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl was a little weirder than Chu Feng thought.

“Lass, are you certain that this is the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl you are looking for?’ Chu Feng asked.

The reason why he asked this question was because the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl they had obtained looked no more than a ball of grass carelessly molded together. Other than the fact that it was golden in color, there was nothing particularly outstanding about it.

It wasn’t glittery all over, and there was no powerful aura to it. Even when observing it under his Heaven’s Eye, Chu Feng was unable to discern anything special about it.

“There’s no doubt about it, this is the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. One of its traits is to disguise itself as wild grass, but ironically, its golden color makes it stand out even more amidst the greenery it tries to conceal itself in.”

In contrast to Chu Feng’s doubtful attitude, Song Yun was extremely excited that she could hardly stay still at all. She swiftly rushed to the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl and tried to pluck it out from the ground.

Weng!

However, as soon as she came into contact with it, the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl suddenly released a burst of energy, causing the space around it to become warped. Song Yun’s figure distorted bizarrely before she was turned into a wisp of air and forcefully dragged into the pearl.

After Song Yun disappeared, the energy also quickly vanished, reverting everything back to its original state.

Having witnessed what had just happened, Chu Feng was a little shaken. At this point, he no longer carried doubts that this ordinary-looking ball of golden grass was the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl.

After seeing how Song Yun had been pulled into it, Chu Feng approached the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl to observe it carefully, taking extra caution not to come into contact with it. However, he was unable to gather any information about it. No matter what means he used, he was unable to see through its peculiarity.

“I have no other choice then.”

With no other choice, Chu Feng gritted his teeth and took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk. He approached the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl and made the same actions as Song Yun just did.

Hu hu hu!

As expected, as soon as Chu Feng’s palm came into contact with the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl, he felt an incredible suction force shrouding his body, making it seem as if the world was spinning around him. Gradually, his consciousness began to fade.

And by the time he finally regained his consciousness, the space around had already reverted back to normal. He was in another world now.
