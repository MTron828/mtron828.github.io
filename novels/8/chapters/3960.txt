Chapter 3960 - The Characteristic Junior Sister Bai

As there were too many people invited, the All-heaven Sect had decided to hold the grand occasion outside.

An enormous floating plaza was temporarily built outside the All-heaven Sect.

At the center of the floating plaza was an extremely extensive space with no decorations or arrangements.

Surrounding that space were multiple palaces.

The palaces had open lofts and enclosed halls.

That said, regardless of what the palaces were like, their windows were all aimed towards the central region of the floating plaza.

Those palaces had all been made for the viewers to rest in.

Although there were multiple palaces, they were not all connected. Instead, they were broken up into groups.

In fact, there was a flag atop every single group of palaces.

On the flags were the names of the respective powers.

This meant that the corresponding powers should be located at the corresponding areas.

“It appears that the All-heaven Sect is very confident in themselves.”

Seeing the arrangement, Chu Feng felt that the All-heaven Sect must possess absolute confidence in being able to obtain the treasure.

Otherwise, there would be no reason for them to invite all those people.

Inviting all those people was undoubtedly to have them witness something.

Witness something?

Naturally, it would be for the crowd to witness their success. The All-heaven Sect wouldn’t possibly want the crowd to witness their failure. That was the reason why Chu Feng guessed that the All-heaven Sect had absolute certainty in being able to obtain that treasure. Otherwise, they definitely wouldn’t put up such a large fanfare.

At that moment, Chu Feng had snuck his way into the Wind Lightning Sword Sect, and entered the same palace as the disciples that were going to participate in the scramble.

This was a sealed palace. Chu Feng and the others inside were able to see everything outside, but the people outside would not be able to see what was happening inside the palace.

When the treasure scramble began, the gates of the palace would open. Chu Feng and the others would leave the palace at the same time and enter the world created by the treasure.

Because of that, after Chu Feng observed the situation outside, he turned his gaze to the disciples of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Chu Feng was searching for someone.

“Oh, that one should be Bai Lulu.”

“It must be said that she’s quite an outstanding young woman. It’s no wonder Wang Chen was willing to kill his fellow disciple, and Song Xiao refused to surrender even in the face of death.”

The person Chu Feng was searching for was none other than Song Xiao and Wang Chen’s junior sister Bai.

Chu Feng had learned that their junior sister Bai was named Bai Lulu. He had also learned what she looked like.

That being said, Chu Feng had to admit that Bai Lulu in the flesh looked better than he’d imagined her.

It was not her appearance. Rather, it was the air she emitted.

In terms of her face alone, Bai Lulu would only be slightly above average, and barely qualified as a beauty. She was someone who was extremely far from the devastating beauties capable of causing the downfall of a city or state.

However, Bai Lulu had very fair skin, and appeared very pure and innocent.

Especially her adorable look and her clear gaze, they made her look like a little spirit untainted by the mundane world. Seeing her, one would want to protect her.

A woman like her was indeed very charming.

“What sort of power is that Red-dress Holy Land?”

Just when Chu Feng was secretly observing Bai Lulu, the disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect were secretly observing the situation outside. The words ‘Red-dress Holy Land’ had entered their field of vision.

The reason why they noticed the Red-dress Holy Land was because all the regions at the floating plaza were packed full.

Only the Red-dress Holy Land was completely empty.

Judging from the timing of things, the grand occasion was soon to begin.

The crowd were all able to tell that the Red-dress Holy Land was simply not giving the All-heaven Sect face, and did not show up.

“Red-dress Holy Land, I’ve heard of them.”

“The Red-dress Holy Land is filled with beauties. Especially that woman by the name of Yin Zhuanghong, she’s deemed to be the All-heaven Starfield’s number one beauty,” said a Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciple.

“Number one beauty? I’ve heard way too many titles like that. However, very few among them could actually be considered to be beauties,” the words spoken by that disciple were immediately met with a refute by a female disciple.

There was a trace of jealousy in her voice.

“Junior sister, you’re mistaken. That Yin Zhuanghong is not someone with a false reputation. I’ve heard that the All-heaven Sect’s Nangong Yifan is extremely fond of Yin Zhuanghong,” said that disciple.

“Oh?”

Hearing those words, that female disciple’s expression changed. The other disciples present also became interested.

From their reactions, Chu Feng could tell that Nangong Yifan was truly quite famous.

That said, it was rather normal for him to be famous. After all, the scramble this time would be a confrontation between people of the younger generation. It was only natural for those disciples to scout out their opponents.

As Nangong Yifan was the strongest member of the younger generation from the All-heaven Starfield, he was an existence that they could not neglect.

That said, upon learning that the Red-dress Holy Land was a place with only women, and Yin Zhuanghong was the woman Nangong Yifan was deeply interested in, the voices of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect disciples became even more jealous.

There were even people that began criticizing the Red-dress Holy Land. The majority of them were female disciples.

Seeing this scene, Chu Feng was unable to help but sigh at how terrifying a woman’s jealousy was.

Even though they’d never met one another and had only heard of Yin Zhuanghong’s beauty, they actually still felt jealous of her.

In fact, it was not only the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s disciples that were discussing the Red-dress Holy Land. Many other people were also discussing them.

The topics of the crowd’s discussions were pretty much identical. They were all pondering why the Red-dress Holy Land, a power of the All-heaven Starfield, was actually refusing to give the All-heaven Sect face.

Compared to the curious crowd, Chu Feng reacted rather calmly.

After all, he knew about the grievances between the All-heaven Sect and the Red-dress Holy Land.

The All-heaven Sect and the Red-dress Holy Land were merely a small distance away from having a complete falling out. They were actually already enemies.

“Senior brother Ouyang, you’ve arrived?”

Suddenly, the crowd grew restless.

Even though the people there were all top disciples of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect, even though they were all extremely haughty and arrogant, they all became eagerly attentive.

The men became humble, and the women started smiling brilliantly with unconcealable joy on their faces.

The reason for all this was due to the arrival of an individual.

It was a man by the name of Ouyang Pinzhi.

Ouyang Pingzhi was a rank two Exalted. His strength was on par with Nangong Yifan’s.

He was also the number one disciple of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect.

Ouyang Pingzhi not only possessed outstanding talent, but he also had an impressive identity. His grandfather was the current sectmaster of the Wind Lighting Sword Sect. As for his father, he was the head elder.

As such, Ouyang Pingzhi, with his identity and his talent, was practically set to succeed the Wind Lightning Sword Sect as the future sectmaster.

As such, he was naturally the person that various disciples wanted to pursue. This was especially true for the female disciples; they all dreamed of marrying Ouyang Pingzhi.

That said, Ouyang Pingzhi turned a blind eye to the admiring gazes of the female disciples. After entering the palace, his gaze was focused on a single person only.

That person was Bai Lulu.

Bai Lulu could be said to be the only person present that did not place Ouyang Pingzhi in her eyes.

After all, even Chu Feng was examining Ouyang Pingzhi.

Bai Lulu, on the other hand, was completely ignored him.

Although that might be the case, Ouyang Pingzhi showed particular concern for her.

He even ignored the crowd to walk directly over to her.

“Junior sister Bai, the treasure scramble is soon to begin.”

“The six great powers will definitely battle chaotically. It will definitely be very dangerous.”

“At that time, just follow me. I will protect you,” Ouyang Pingzhi said to Bai Lulu.

Once he said those words, multiple jealous gazes were cast towards Bai Lulu.

They were from the other female disciples.

After all, to be protected by Ouyang Pingzhi was something they could only dream of.

What they could only dream of had been obtained by Bai Lulu instead. With this, how could they not be jealous?

“Thank you, senior brother Ouyang.”

Bai Lulu bowed to express her thanks. However, she was not very enthusiastic.

“Junior sister Bai, we’re all family. There’s no need for you to be so courteous.”

As Ouyang Pingzhi spoke, he extended his arm and placed it on Bai Lulu’s shoulder.

His intimate behavior immediately intensified the jealousy in the female disciples’ eyes. Some were even gnashing their teeth.

However, Ouyang Pingzhi’s actions instead caused Bai Lulu to blush. She immediately moved aside and avoided him.

Then, she actually spoke with a stern voice, “Senior brother Ouyang, please behave with dignity.”

‘Behave with dignity.’ What a ‘behave with dignity.’

Her single phrase, ‘behave with dignity’ had expressed her standpoint.

Bai Lulu actually refused the fondness of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s number one disciple.

Originally, Chu Feng was only curious about that Bai Lulu. However, after witnessing her character, he was unable to help but view her in a new light.

‘This girl is quite interesting,’ Chu Feng thought in his heart.
