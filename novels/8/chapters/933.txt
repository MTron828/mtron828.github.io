MGA: Chapter 934 - Unattainable

“Since there are true treasures concealed within this Imperial Door, doesn’t that also mean there are true dangers concealed within this Imperial Door?” Chu Feng asked. He had experienced the might of the Imperial Door, so he knew how horrifying it was. He retained deep fear for this Imperial Door.

“The three of us aren’t even qualified to walk pass the first statue. Don’t even think about it. At least as of now, we cannot enter the Imperial Door.” Taikou shook his head.

Although Qiu Canfeng said nothing, he shook his head in agreement. Though it was clear these two Martial Kings coveted the treasures inside, they no longer dared to advance.

“Eggy, what do you think about this?”

Chu Feng had no choice but to ask Eggy for advice. He too could feel there were huge gains to be had within the Imperial Door, but as Taikou said, there were incomparable dangers as well.

“To be honest, there are various mechanisms in the Imperial Tomb, and every Imperial Tomb laid by a Martial Emperor varies as well. Because of that, I’m not too clear on the things inside the Imperial Tomb, so I am less clear on the things regarding the Imperial Door.

“But I can feel that this Imperial Door is not simple at all. That’s why I had said this Imperial Door may very well be an Imperial Armament.

“After another look today, I am even more certain,” Eggy said sweetly.

“Imperial Armament? Eggy, you’re saying that this Imperial Door is truly an Imperial Armament? But what’s with the vast starry sky?” Chu Feng asked.

“My understanding of Imperial Tomb is limited, but I do have a decent understanding of Imperial Armaments. A true Imperial Armament is very powerful. Not only does it have an unstoppable Emperor-level Martial power, it is the creation of a powerful Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. So, naturally, it has the ability to create an independent space.

“Therefore, this Imperial Door is definitely an Imperial Armament. It’s too perfect of a match. Moreover, it is a Masterless Imperial Armament,” Eggy said with certainty.

“Masterless Imperial Armament?” After hearing those three words, Chu Feng’s heartbeat quickened. An indescribable feeling of elation stemmed from his heart. A Royal Armament was already so powerful, so one would not even be able to imagine the strength of an Imperial Armament. And now, there was even a Masterless Imperial Armament lain before him. To say his heart wasn’t moved would be a lie.

“Chu Feng, one must consider their own strength before acting. The treasures within the Imperial Door aren’t within our abilities to acquire. However, it is our luck that we’ve been able to discover this place,” Qiu Canfeng quickly urged. He seemed to have seen Chu Feng’s strong desire in his eyes, and was afraid he would do some sort of rash and fatal move.

“Chu Feng, your master is right. With your aptitude, it is greatly possible that you become a Martial Emperor in the future. Since no one’s discovered this place yet, this is basically just a treasure left solely for you. As long as you have more success in cultivation, you can come back and take it any time. There’s no need to be in any sort of rush,” Taikou urged as well.

“Yeah yeah! These two old ones are right! The power of a Masterless Imperial Armament is limitless. It’s not something you can control, nor something you can gain the approval of. It’s better to work hard in cultivation and in the future, when you have a certain amount of strength, you can come back and take it. Hehe.” Even Eggy spoke with a giggle.

Chu Feng couldn’t help bitterly smiling at their words. He really did want to get his hands on the Imperial Armament, and he really did want to seize it for himself, but he knew very clearly that he was simply unqualified right now to wield this Imperial Armament.

However even though he knew he could not enter the Imperial Door, Chu Feng couldn’t help himself. He used the Heaven’s Eyes as he stood outside the door, and carefully observed as he cast his gaze inward.

Before the Heaven’s Eyes, all things showed their true form.

Yet... even though he knew the starry sky within the Imperial Door was fake, Chu Feng could see no evidence of that. The strength of the person who built everything within the Imperial Door could thus be seen.

Although Chu Feng was unable to see the essence of the thing inside the Imperial Door, Chu Feng noticed a formation engraved atop the shut city gates. Within the formation, there were three round gaps. Around those gaps were special engraved patterns.

Chu Feng recognized those patterns: one represented ice, and one represented fire. These two markings merged with each other.

The first thought that sprang into Chu Feng’s mind was that the key to open the gates related to ice and fire.

Judging by the size of the gap, Chu Feng couldn’t help but think of Su Rou, Su Mei, and the Azure Dragon Founder.

The size of those three gaps were the exact same as the Ice and Fire Pearls within Su Rou’s and Su Mei’s Body, and the Azure Dragon Founder’s pearl that led to his body’s immortality.

“Those three pearls are so mystical, and they have inestimable power. Perhaps it is the critical solution to opening the gates.

“However, the Ice and Fire Pearls are sealed in Little Rou’s and Little Mei’s body. This...

“Whatever. This Imperial Armament isn’t something I can take right now anyway. With sufficiently powerful strength, there are no impossibilities. I can always think about this later in the future.”

After some consideration, he had indeed learnt how far he was before he could interact with the Imperial Door. So, he didn’t bother looking for annoyances and obediently left with Qiu Canfeng and Taikou. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, before they left the Imperial Tomb completely, they covered up its last entrance together with great seriousness and detail. The reason they did that was solely for the treasure within.

They naturally did not wish for others to discover that treasure.

Afterwards, Chu Feng and the others went to meet up with Lady Piaomiao and Qiushui Fuyan.

“Even Lady Piaomiao has come? Chu Feng, Brother Taikou, what’s happened in the Eastern Sea Region?” Qiu Canfeng asked. After knowing that even Lady Piaomiao had come to the eastern continents, he had realized the severity of the present situation.

Chu Feng didn’t hide anything as he carefully narrated to Qiu Canfeng everything that had happened up until now: He joined the Crippling Night Demon Sect, but You Mingdeng drove him out; the conflicts between the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Immortal Execution Archipelago; and the attack onto the Misty Peak by the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s alliance as they used the excuse of Lady Piaomiao’s protection.

After knowing everything that had happened—especially after knowing You Mingdeng drove Chu Feng out of the Crippling Night Demon Sect even though he had done so much for them—Qiu Canfeng gritted his teeth from anger. He was extremely furious.

However, at the same time, Qiu Canfeng was also very happy. He never would have expected his disciple could pull out the unpullable Demon Sealing Sword. One must know that he, and the three other Protectors, had attempted to draw out the Demon Sealing Sword in their struggle over the position of sect head, but they had all failed.

“Chu Feng, don’t worry. Your master here will collect everything the Crippling Night Demon Sect owes you. They fear that you will affect their influence? I’ll do exactly that. I’ll push you onto a position they will fear,” Qiu Canfeng said gravely.

“Master, do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“I will have you become the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect,” Qiu Canfeng said solemnly.
