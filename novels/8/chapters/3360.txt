Chapter 3360 - Ashamed Clansmen

“Big sister, are you truly able to remove the poison from my clan’s Clan Chief?” Chu Feng asked Bai Liluo. What he was worried about the most at that moment was the poison in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Little brother, you need not worry about it.”

“That guy utilized my power to create the poison to begin with. Naturally, your big sister would be able to remove the poison. Here, have your clan chief take this medicinal soup. I guarantee that he will wake up afterwards, and his body will gradually recover,” as Bai Liluo spoke, she took out a bowl of medicinal soup.

However, upon seeing the medicinal soup, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all started to frown.

It was not only the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were reacting in such a manner; even the outsiders like the Fang Heavenly Clansmen revealed dubious gazes.

The bowl of medicinal soup was composed of bubbling thick black liquid. Not only was the liquid very disgusting, but it also smelled very bad.

It was difficult to describe the smell. Nevertheless, it was very disgusting. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The smell of the soup was simply even more nauseating than the smell of feces.

How could that possibly be the antidote?

“Great, this is truly great!”

However, compared to the bystander’s suspicions, Chu Feng had an overjoyed expression.

Although the bystanders might not trust Bai Liluo, Chu Feng firmly trusted her.

Since she had said that the bowl of ‘soup’ was the antidote, then it must be the antidote.

“Wuu~~~”

Suddenly, the expression of joy on Chu Feng’s face was replaced with an expression of pain. Not only did his expression start to distort, but he even let out sounds of pain. Immediately afterward, his Lightning Armor, Lightning Mark and the Ancient Era’s Secret Skills all disappeared at the same time.

Chu Feng’s cultivation returned to rank seven Martial Immortal from rank nine Martial Immortal.

Immediately after that, Chu Feng half knelt on the ground.

His complexion became extremely pale, and his aura extremely weak. Most importantly, the paleness of his complexion and the weakness of his aura were still rapidly increasing.

“Putt~~~”

Finally, Chu Feng’s body leaned to the side and he fell to the ground. He had lost consciousness.

“Chu Feng!!!”

Witnessing that scene, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others were all deeply worried. Chu Qing and the others immediately rushed over to his side to inspect his condition.

Everyone was puzzled by Chu Feng’s sudden collapse.

“It should be caused by the Heavenly Lightning. Chu Feng has been bombarded by Heavenly Lightning for multiple days. Even if he was able to withstand them, it’s impossible for him to be completely fine.”

“Likely, his body is extremely weak right now. Earlier, he was only able to fight the Fang Heavenly Clansmen thanks to his outstanding willpower. His willpower’s definitely not something that ordinary people possess.”

“And now, he has won the battle, and learned that his clan chief could be saved. Because of that, he finally felt relieved. However, the sudden relief caused his body to be seized by the weakness from the suffering of the past few days.”

“It is good that he has lost consciousness. After all, he needs to get some rest,” Wuming Fenghuo said.

The crowd all came to a sudden realization upon hearing what he said.

Indeed, Chu Feng was on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform of all things. A single bolt of Heavenly Lightning was capable of obliterating ordinary individuals. As for Chu Feng, he had endured an unknown number of lightning bolts. Thus, how could he possibly be fine?

At the moment when the crowd were admiring Chu Feng’s willpower and dedication, Wuming Fenghuo swept his gaze across the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. He sighed and said, “Merely, it’s quite laughable.”

“The Fang Heavenly Clan’s three thousand elites were unable to cause the slightest injury to Chu Feng.”

“Yet, Chu Feng failed to escape from the plot of his own clansmen.”

Mockery. Oh what utter mockery was this?

Most importantly, Wuming Fenghuo’s mocking words were the truth.

Why did Chu Feng suffer the torment of the Heavenly Lightning? Wasn’t it because he was persecuted by his fellow clansmen?

At that moment, it was not only the people that had plotted against Chu Feng that lowered their heads quietly; all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen had grown quiet.

Even though the great majority of them did not wish to cause Chu Feng harm, they did not choose to believe him after the poisoning occurred. More than that, they did not choose to protect him. In fact... they even criticized him, and wanted him to die.

This was especially true earlier. Chu Feng had just been tortured by the Heavenly Lightning and was seriously injured. His body was as weak as it could be. Yet, for the sake of their Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory, he did not choose to heal his injuries, and instead resolutely entered the grand formation to battle against the Fang Heavenly Clan.

However, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, faced with such a Chu Feng, not only did not feel the slightest bit of admiration and appreciation, but instead deliberately made fools of themselves; of Chu Feng, by choosing to surrender rather than fight alongside him.

Oh... what sort of irony was this?

“Chu Hanxian. Chu Xuanyuan. Chu Feng.”

“Three demon-level geniuses have all come from your Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“It is obvious that the heavens have shown great concern for your Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“However, I feel that your Chu Heavenly Clan should properly reflect upon yourselves. Think of what you all have done. Is it worthy of such geniuses?” Wuming Fenghuo added.

His words, compared to his mocking words from before, were even more mocking.

Like sharp blades, each and every word pierced the Chu Heavenly Clansmen’s hearts.

At that moment, not only were the Chu Heavenly Clansmen quiet, but expressions of shame had also covered their faces.

Regardless of whether they were of the older generation or younger generation, they all felt ashamed.

Indeed, were they worthy of such geniuses?

Ever since Chu Feng had returned to their Chu Heavenly Clan, he had endured persecution from countless fellow clansmen. Why didn’t they protect a genius of his caliber? why did they instead think of every possible method to kill him?

The answer was very clear, everyone knew why.

Their Chu Heavenly Clan was not worthy of having a genius like Chu Feng.
