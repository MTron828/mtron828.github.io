Chapter 5741: Call Him Hubby Instead

The square was so silent that the only sound that could be heard was Xianhai Shaoyu nuzzling in Chu Feng’s arms. Everyone was stunned, be it man or woman.

If Xianhai Yu’er was the goddess of countless men, Xianhao Shaoyu would be the god of countless women. Why were the two of them diving into Chu Feng’s embrace? Was he even worthy of this?

This had to be a lie, right?

It was only till another voice sounded that they shook out of their daze and came to terms that this was reality.

“Big brother, are you insane?” Little Fishy grabbed Xianhai Shaoyu’s ears and angrily dragged him out of Chu Feng’s arms.

“Hear my explanation, little sister! I’m not in that kind of relationship with Chu Feng!” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Pui! Stay away from my big brother Chu Feng. If you dare do this again, I’ll tell everyone about your depraved reading materials!” Little Fishy pouted as she twisted her brother’s ears with one hand and placed the other on her slim waist. She looked really angry.

Xianhao Shaoyu quickly clasped Little Fishy’s mouth and said, “Don’t talk nonsense, my little sister. What do you mean by depraved reading materials?”

His explanation piqued everyone’s curiosity.

What could the depraved reading materials they are talking about refer to? Does Xianhai Shaoyu have such an interest? No, what’s more important is whether Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Yu’er have such a close relationship with Chu Feng or not!

The crowd turned to look at Chu Feng and the others once more.

Little Fishy hurled Xianhai Shaoyu aside, walked up to Chu Feng, turned to face Long Muxi and Xian Miaomiao, and politely asked, “Big brother, are these two big sisters your friends?”

“Little Fishy, let me introduce you to them. This is Long Muxi from the Totem Dragon Clan, and this is her younger brother, Long Chengyu. As for this lady, she is Xian Miaomiao. We are both from the Eastern Region, and we have known each other for many years,” Chu Feng said.

“Hehe! Miss Yu’er, I have long heard you’re as beautiful as a fairy, but the rumors are understating your beauty now that I’m seeing you in the flesh. You’re simply too beautiful!” Long Chengyu scratched his head while grinning like a fool.

He was embarrassed despite his usual rowdy and brazen personality.

Little Fishy responded to Long Chengyu with a polite smile before turning back to Long Muxi and Xian Miaomiao and saying, “Big sisters, you’re my big brother’s friends, and that makes you my friends too. Come, why don’t we have a chat over there?”

“Sure,” Xian Miaomiao replied with a sweet smile.

Long Muxi responded with a slight nod.

“Big brother, come with us.” Even though she was inviting Xian Miaomiao and Long Muxi, Little Fishy grabbed Chu Feng’s arm and dragged him toward her residence.

“Little sister, why are you taking him away? It has been a long time since I last met Brother Chu Feng. We ought to have a good chat too!” Xianhai Shaoyu exclaimed with a frantic wave of his hands.

“Cut the crap! Come with us if you want to chat. Or would you prefer that we talk about your depraved reading choices here?” Little Fishy shot a disdainful glance at Xianhai Shaoyu.

Xianhai Shaoyu heaved a sigh. He turned to Long Chengyu and said, “Come with us.”

Long Chengyu was a bit frightened of Xianhai Shaoyu as there was a conflict between them, but he accepted the latter’s offer with a nod, saying, “All right.”

Under the crowd’s incredulous stares, the group of them made their way to Little Fishy’s residence.

“What’s with his luck? How did he come to get acquainted with Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhao Yu’er? And what did he call Xianhai Yu’er earlier? Little Fishy? That’s too intimate! Did you see how Xianhai Yu’er grabbed Chu Feng’s arm earlier? Isn’t she afraid of dirtying her hands?” Qin Shu gritted her teeth in anger.

“What does grabbing his arm count as? She dived right into Chu Feng’s arms. You didn’t see that?” Qin Xuan asked.

“Of course I did! I just don’t understand what’s going on.” Qin Shu’s eyes reddened in envy.

“It looks like they are really on close terms,” Qin Xuan said.

There was hardly anyone in the world of cultivation who didn’t know about Chu Feng’s bad blood with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It was one thing for Long Chengyu to do so, but Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Yu’er’s earlier actions clearly indicated that they were siding with Chu Feng too.

Of course, this matter still needed further verification. They would have to wait for the prodigies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to make a move first to confirm Xianhai Shaoyu and Xianhai Yu’er’s stances.

“Big brother, are we going to let Chu Feng go just like that? Do I have to watch him strut around the Nine Heavens’ Zenith?” Qin Shu asked.

He couldn’t wait to deal with Chu Feng, especially after seeing how intimate Xianhai Yu’er was with the latter. This should have been a stage for him to shine, but Chu Feng was hogging all the attention. How could he accept this?

“We aren’t going to let Chu Feng off the hook, but don’t make a reckless move yet,” Qin Xuan said before taking his leave, leaving Qin Shu to continue staring at Xianhai Yu’er’s residence.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the others entered Little Fishy’s residence.

Little Fishy took out a teapot and steeped some tea for Chu Feng and the others. She poured a cup of tea and gently blew on it before serving it to Chu Feng, saying, “Big brother, have a taste. My tea tastes amazing.”

She looked no different from a virtuous wife.

Long Chengyu’s eyes widened at that sight.

“Mm, it tastes great,” Chu Feng replied with a thumbs up.

“Of course.” Little Fishy smiled sweetly after receiving Chu Feng’s compliment.

Only then did she proceed to serve tea to the others.

“Big sister Miaomiao, have some tea. Big sister Muxi, have some tea.”

After Xian Miaomiao and Long Muxi received their respective teacups, Long Chengyu’s posture noticeably straightened up. He had already thought of what he was going to say after receiving his teacup.

But to his disappointment, Little Fishy settled down beside Chu Feng before turning to Xianhai Shaoyu and Long Chengyu. “Feel free, the two of you.”

“…”

Long Chengyu was rendered speechless. He had a feeling he was being discriminated against.

On the other hand, Xianhai Shaoyu was already used to it. He poured a cup of tea for himself. Before taking a sip, he glanced at Chu Feng and said, “Brother Chu Feng, I’m benefiting from your halo. This is my first time tasting my little sister’s tea.”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You are full of nonsense.” Little Fishy directed an eye roll in Xianhai Shaoyu’s direction while topping up Chu Feng’s teacup.

Beautiful people looked impeccable no matter what they did. Even her eye roll was adorable.

“It looks like you two siblings are on very close terms,” Xian Miamiao remarked with a sweet smile.

“Who’s on close terms with him? I’m only on close terms with my big brother!” Little Fishy turned to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.

“Enough, enough. Why don’t you just call him hubby straight?” Xianhai Shaoyu snorted.

Xian Miaomiao, Long Muxi, and Long Chengyu were taken aback. They hadn’t expected Xianhai Shaoyu to be so direct. This wasn’t a joke to be taken lightly.

Much to their surprise, Little Fishy’s face turned as red as an apple. She became so nervous that she couldn’t even utter a word.

Seeing her expression, Long Chengyu’s eyeballs nearly popped out. Heavens! Is Xianhai Yu’er really in love with Chu Feng?

To alleviate the awkwardness, Chu Feng quickly stepped in and said, “Stop your teasing for a moment. There’s something important I need to ask you.”

“What is it?” Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy asked.

“The two of you arrived here early. Have you met the Divine Body Realm’s Wang Qiang?” Chu Feng asked.

He wanted to verify if the Wang Qiang here was the Wang Qiang he knew.
