Chapter 2588 - Unknown Burial Ground

“I’m alright. This is merely a backlash from using forbidden medicines and forcibly using a secret skill that I cannot control.”

“I have already taken healing medicines. I will be fine after resting for some time,” Chu Feng said.

“If it’s a backlash, merely resting will not be enough. Master, you must immediately heal your injuries,” That mysterious man said.

“Seniors, do the two of you want to tell me something?” Chu Feng looked to Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua.

“Chu Feng, you should heal your injuries first. The pain from a backlash is no small matter. If serious, they can even cause one’s death. Moreover, you’ve even taken forbidden medicines,” Kong Shunlian said.

“You should cure your injuries first,” Kong Yuehua added.

“In that case, seniors, I shall trouble the three of you to wait for me a bit.”

Seeing that, Chu Feng no longer hesitated. He hurriedly sat cross-legged and set up a grand healing formation around himself. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Actually, the backlash Chu Feng had received this time was much more serious than the backlash he had received when he fought against Li Yue’er last time.

Not only had Chu Feng taken forbidden medicines, he had also utilized the Ancient Era’s War Sword for a much longer period of time, and did so with greater strength compared to last time.

Thus, the backlash he received from the Ancient Era’s War Sword would naturally be much more serious. On top of that, Chu Feng also received the backlash from the three forbidden medicines. Thus, the combined backlash Chu Feng was receiving was truly not something that ordinary people could endure.

Fortunately Chu Feng possessed astonishing willpower. If it were someone else, they would’ve already fainted from the pain that felt as if their body and soul were about to be torn apart.

............

Although the pain from the backlash was extremely serious, Chu Feng was, after all, a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

By utilizing both healing medicines and world spirit formations, Chu Feng soon brought relief to the pain from the backlash. In the end, he managed to overcome the crisis.

Of course, as the backlash this time around was fiercer, the amount of time needed to neutralize the backlash was also longer.

When Chu Feng removed his spirit formation, he discovered that Kong Shunlian, Kong Yuehua and that mysterious individual were still standing there.

“Seniors, exactly why have the two of you asked me here? Where is Zhao Hong?” Chu Feng asked.

Upon seeing Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian, Chu Feng was able to tell that these two Kong Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders didn’t seem to hold great hostility toward him.

However, Chu Feng was still worried about Zhao Hong’s safety.

“Let’s change locations to talk,” Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua said. After saying that, they continued traveling.

“Master, you do not have to worry. It will be fine as long as you follow this subordinate,” That mysterious individual said to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was able to tell that it was most definitely not a coincidence for the mysterious individual to appear. Likely, he had been with Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua to begin with.

Furthermore, even though Chu Feng had no idea who that mysterious individual was, he could tell from his attitude that the mysterious individual would definitely protect him should anything happen.

With the mysterious individual there, the discomfort in Chu Feng’s heart had decreased greatly.

Finally, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua stopped in the middle of a desert.

“Here?”

Upon arriving, Chu Feng’s gaze changed immediately.

He discovered that the desert was very different. Thus, he activated his Heaven’s Eyes to carefully inspect the desert.

The more Chu Feng inspected, the more startled Chu Feng became. It was a burial ground.

Even though that place was especially hidden, Chu Feng was still able to determine very quickly using his Heaven’s Eyes that there should be a burial ground or a treasure deposit below the desert.

Furthermore, judging by the scale of the burial ground, that burial ground should be very dangerous. The more dangerous a burial ground was, the greater the opportunity one could generally find within it.

“Wow, we are truly lucky. There’s actually such a treasure deposit here,” Her Lady Queen was overjoyed.

“I’m afraid that things are not that simple,” Chu Feng shook his head. Then, he looked to Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua. He knew that Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua would not have brought him There for no reason.

They most definitely possessed some sort of goal.

“Chu Feng, we believe that you have already noticed,” Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua said in unison.

“Seniors, exactly what are you all...?” Chu Feng was confused. He did not understand exactly what Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua were planning.

“Firstly, although our Kong Heavenly Clan was not personally extinguished by you, it is still related to you.”

“After all, two years ago, you indeed unleashed a massacre in our Kong Heavenly Clan. A lot of people from our Kong Heavenly Clan died by your hands.”

“Although it was our Kong Heavenly Clan that was in the wrong back then, but, to be honest, as members of the Kong Heavenly Clan, it is impossible for us to not feel hatred toward you,” Kong Yuehua said to Chu Feng.

“Seniors, this junior understands your frame of mind.”

“However, there is one thing that this junior needs to make clear,” Chu Feng raised the Evil God Sword he held in his hand, “Back then, being forced into a corner by your Kong Heavenly Clan, I had no choice but to use this Evil God Sword in order to survive.”

“As for this Evil God Sword, it is a Demon Armament. More often than not, I am unable to control its powers.”

“That day, I was under the control of this Demon Armament. I did not intend to unleash that massacre.”

“Furthermore, I also tried my best to hold the Evil God Sword back. Otherwise... the Kong Heavenly Clan would not have been exterminated by Ying Mingchao,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua’s expressions changed somewhat.

They understood what Chu Feng meant. After all, they had both witnessed Chu Feng’s strength when he was using the Evil God Sword.

If Chu Feng had not tried his hardest to hold the Evil God Sword back, Ying Mingchao would indeed not have eliminated the Kong Heavenly Clan.

Because the Kong Heavenly Clan would’ve already been exterminated by Chu Feng two years ago.

Suddenly, Kong Shunlian Sighed deeply. He said, “Fate. This is the fate of our Kong Heavenly Clan.”

After saying those words, Kong Shunlian turned around. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Chu Feng, we have actually not called you here because we want to seek you for revenge.”

“Rather, we have called you here to save Zhao Hong,” Kong Yuehua said to Chu Feng.

“Save Zhao Hong?”

“What has happened to Zhao Hong?” Chu Feng asked worriedly.

“There are a lot of remnants in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. However, the most dangerous of them all is the Unknown Burial Ground.”

“Over the years, countless martial cultivation experts and world spiritists have entered the Unknown Burial Ground. However, not a single one was able to return alive.”

“The remnant before us is the Unknown Burial Ground. The remnant that Zhao Hong entered is also the Unknown Burial Ground,” Kong Yuehua said.

“How did you all come to know that Zhao Hong was in danger?”

“Furthermore, how did you all know that Zhao Hong entered this Unknown Burial Ground?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng knew that Zhao Hong had entered a remnant in search of an opportunity to reach a breakthrough in her cultivation. However, not even he knew where Zhao Hong had gone to.

Thus, he was unable to understand how Kong Yuehua and the others knew Zhao Hong’s whereabouts.

Kong Yuehua did not answer Chu Feng’s question. Instead, she looked to the mysterious individual beside Chu Feng with a very meaningful gaze.

“Senior?” Chu Feng also looked to that mysterious individual.

He knew that this matter was very possibly more closely related to this mysterious individual.

“Master, can we speak in private?” The mysterious individual said to Chu Feng.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded.

Then, that mysterious individual brought Chu Feng far away from the location of the remnant.

Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian did not follow after them.

At that moment, that mysterious individual finally removed his hood and revealed his appearance to Chu Feng.

It turned out that he was an old man. There was nothing special about that old man’s appearance. He looked very simple and down-to-earth.

Seeing the old man, Chu feng was even more puzzled. The reason for that was because Chu Feng was certain that he had never met that old man before.

Suddenly, that mysterious old man kneeled before Chu Feng. Respectfully, he said, “This old man is the current clan chief of the guardian clan. I pay my respects to Young Master Chu Feng.”

“Guardian clan? You are from the guardian clan?” Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.

Chu Feng naturally knew of the guardian clan. It was a mysterious clan in charge of looking after the Hundred Refinements Stage. Furthermore, there was an extraordinary relationship between the guardian clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan.

It was no wonder the old man would address Chu Feng as ‘Master.’
