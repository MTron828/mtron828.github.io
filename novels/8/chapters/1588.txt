MGA: Chapter 1589 - From Hell To Heaven

“Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to Weaponry Refinement Immortal,” Chu Feng did not dare to act disrespectful toward the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. Immediately, he greeted him courteously.

At this moment, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal slowly raised his head and inspected Chu Feng carefully. Contained within his gaze was neither the sharpness of an expert nor the arrogance of an extraordinary person. Rather, his gaze was very amiable and gentle. In fact, there was even a trace of appreciation and admiration. From that gaze alone, Chu Feng was able to tell that he seemed to have obtained the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s good impression. It seemed that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was a bit fond of him.

“Pat, pat~~”

Suddenly, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal patted the ground beside the stove that was covered with hay. He said, “Come, sit.”

Chu Feng did not hesitate. He walked over and sat down. After getting closer to the stove, not only was the fragrance of the sweet potatoes even stronger, Chu Feng also felt warmth.

“It’s a bit hot. However, it’s very tasty. Have a try,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal picked up a cooked sweet potato and handed it to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng accepted the sweet potato and began to bite down on it. Then, he said from the bottom of his heart, “This sweet potato is truly good.” Then, Chu Feng continued to eat the sweet potato with large bites. Even though he was before the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, Chu Feng did not feel restricted at all. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Haha... it’s good that you like it. Young people like you all have grown accustomed to exotic delicacies. There are not many things that you all are fond of eating nowadays,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal smiled lightly. He seemed to be very pleased with Chu Feng’s performance.

Then, he said, “The sea is filled with detection spirit formations set up by me. I was able to clearly see all that happened in the sea. Your performance was very good. You possess accurate judgement that is rarely seen.”

“Senior, you’re flattering me. Actually, for this junior to be able to choose the correct passages, luck was also a factor,” Chu Feng said modestly.

“There’s no need for you to be modest. All of your decisions were made after careful deliberation. You did not blindly choose anything. Thus, how could luck possibly be a factor?”

“Furthermore, your performance was not only limited to your accurate judgement. There was also your character. You were insulted by that Nangong Clan’s girl. Yet, you did not hold a grudge, and even disregarded former hatred to save them when those two sisters were in a crisis. That sort of behavior is very rarely found in youngsters nowadays.”

The Weaponry Refinement Immortal smiled again. Then, he sized up Chu Feng again and said, “You are a dragon among men. It is inevitable that you’ll be envied. Likely, in the future, even if you do not provoke others, others will come and provoke you. That is the tribulation of your life.”

“Senior, is there a way for this junior to neutralize that tribulation?” Chu Feng asked. Chu Feng had encountered a lot of people. It was true that many of them had wanted to kill him due to being envious of his talent. Chu Feng wanted to know how to avoid this from happening again.

“There’s nothing that can be done. In a place like the Holy Land of Martialism, if you are too low-profile and do not reveal your abilities, you will instead become the target of people’s humiliations.”

“If you want to be respected by others, you must reveal your abilities. However, if you reveal your talent and strength, it is inevitable that those lowly vile people will become jealous of you.”

“There’s nothing that can be done about that. The world of cultivators is a cruel world like this. However, since you’ve passed my trials, I am able to make you a tailor-made weapon. That should be able to provide you with a bit of assistance,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.

“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng expressed his thanks.

“There’s no need for you to be this courteous. This is only what you deserve,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal smiled lightly.

“Senior, there is a matter that this junior wishes to ask for your guidance on in,” Chu Feng said.

“What is it?” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal asked.

“This junior has two friends who also entered the trials of the Immortal Island. However, I do not know where they are right now. As senior is able to see everything that has happened here, I presume that senior already knows who my friends are. Thus, junior wishes to ask senior whether they are currently safe,” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, I cannot answer that question,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal shook his head.

“Senior, this is something that is extremely important to this junior. Please, please tell junior,” Chu Feng continued to ask. To him, the safety of Su Rou and Zi Ling was truly too important. At this moment, only the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was capable of giving him an answer. Chu Feng did not wish to miss this opportunity. Even if he might end up angering the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, he still had to continue to ask.

“This is the Immortal Island’s rule. I cannot reveal anything regarding others to you. You can return.”

“I will allow you all to enter the Immortal Cultivation Lake to train tonight. The time limit is a single night. You should be able to obtain some harvest from there. Return and take a rest. Adjust your state of mind. Only when you are at your best state will you be able to obtain the best harvest from the Immortal Cultivation Lake.”

The Weaponry Refinement Immortal was not angered by Chu Feng’s insistence. Merely, he still refused to provide Chu Feng with an answer.

“In that case, junior shall take his leave. Thank you for your hospitality, senior.” Feeling helpless, Chu Feng had no choice but to leave.

After Chu Feng left, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal suddenly closed his eyes and sighed. “Such a rare sapling. Unfortunately, I cannot take him as a disciple. This is truly unfortunate.” He sighed again.

Chu Feng did not know about the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s sighing. After he returned to his residence, Chu Feng became even more worried. It could be said that his heart was extremely distracted, and his thoughts were in utter turmoil.

Chu Feng had actually journeyed all the way here not for the sake of the Weaponry Bestowment Assembly, nor to meet a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.

His true purpose was to find Zi Ling and Su Rou. Yet, at this time, not only did he not manage to find them, he could not even obtain any news regarding them. It was very possible that the two of them might have met with accidents. As such, how could Chu Feng be at ease?

Obtaining tailor-made weapons from the Weaponry Refinement Immortal or entering the Cultivation Immortal Lake to train were all meaningless to Chu Feng. To him, the only thing he cared about was being able to hear news of Su Rou’s and Zi Ling’s safety.

“Knock, knock, knock~~~”

Right at this moment, a knock came at the door of Chu Feng’s residence. Chu Feng was very dispirited, and appeared to be lost in thought. Subconsciously, he walked over and opened the door.

“Woosh~~~”

After his door was opened, two figures threw themselves into Chu Feng’s bosom and hugged him tightly. Following that, two familiar auras reached Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was startled at first. However, immediately afterward, he was overjoyed. His spirit immediately came back. With his eyes wide open, he looked carefully at the two people who were tightly hugging him. When he saw them, Chu Feng started to beam with happiness. From a state of being extremely dejected, Chu Feng immediately became overjoyed with incomparable excitement.

Hugging him were two women. One was wearing a long blue skirt, and the other was wearing a long purple skirt. One had a very mature charm to her, and the other appeared to be very pure and pleasant. They were none other than Chu Feng’s two lovers who he had been yearning for day and night, Su Rou and Zi Ling.

“Zi Ling, Su Rou, it’s really the two of you?” The sudden appearance of the two women came as an enormous shock to Chu Feng. In fact, he even doubted that this was true. That was because everything had happened too unexpectedly.

“Big brother Chu Feng, it is us. We finally managed to find you, finally managed to see you,” Zi Ling hugged Chu Feng tightly. She actually began to cry. It was clear that she was too overjoyed, too emotional.

As for Su Rou, she was more mature. Thus, her reaction was a bit calmer. However, her beautiful pair of eyes had also reddened. At this moment, even if the two of them did not declare how much they missed Chu Feng, Chu Feng was still able to realize it.

“You two girls have truly worried me to death,” Suddenly, Chu Feng extended his arms and tightly hugged the two exceptional beauties in his bosom. He now believed everything before him to be true. Thus, the worries in his heart were finally lifted.

At this moment, even though Chu Feng had a calm reaction, he was feeling immense joy in his heart. In this short period of time, he felt as if he had gone from a journey from hell to heaven. That sort of sensation was something that only he understood.
