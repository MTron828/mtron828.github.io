Chapter 4557: Destined For Greatness

The silhouette made out of purple lights towered imposingly in the sky, attracting the attention of even those who had no interest in the Niantian Gambling Formation too.

This was the first time they were seeing such a phenomenon.

However, this phenomenon didn’t last for too long before the massive silhouette in the sky dissipated away.

But while the phenomenon had vanished, the crowd was still unable to calm their hearts for a very long while. No one was able to direct their gazes away from Chu Feng.

Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng.

No matter what kind of results he achieved in the upcoming tournament, his name would surely spread far and wide after today. It was just that whether his name would be associated with greatness or become a laughingstock would depend on the results of the upcoming tournament.

If he were to clinch the first place, he would become the top prodigy of the Holy Light Galaxy other than those from the Holy Light Clan.

His reputation would then spread far and wide, perhaps even surpassing that of Yu Lie back then.

However, if Chu Feng failed to take the first place, it would prove that his reputation was built on something unfounded, that Daoist Niantian and all of these juniors had misjudged him. He would be humiliated and mocked by the world.

Perhaps no one would dare to do so in the open, but there would surely be no lack of people who would ridicule him in the shadows.

...

After the phenomenon dissipated, Chu Feng unhesitatingly placed all of his chips on the mountain with his name.

His action didn’t surprise the crowd though. If he really was confident of taking first place in the tournament, it went without saying that he should bet on himself.

There was no such thing as having too much cultivation resource, after all.

“Chu Feng, don’t you dare escape after the tournament!” Shengguang Yu spat coldly.

“Don’t worry, I’ll wait for you,” Chu Feng replied.

“Hah, that better be the case!”

After saying his piece, Shengguang Yu turned around and left.

However, to everyone’s surprise, after Shengguang Yu left, Shengguang Jin’an walked up to Chu Feng, clasped his fist, and said, “Brother Chu Feng, we meet again.”

The warm smile that was on his face made it seem as if he was greeting an old friend.

This made the crowd realize that this mysterious young man from the Holy Light Clan was actually acquainted with Chu Feng, which meant that it wasn’t a coincidence that he appeared here.

Most likely, he specially came over here to help Chu Feng out of the quandary he was in.

Thinking back, Chu Feng had come here together with the Dragon Clan, Monstrous Herd Temple, Yu Heavenly Clan, and Cloudsky Immortal Sect, and the prodigies of those four behemoths also placed all of their chips in Chu Feng.

This could only mean that he was on close terms with the four behemoths, or else there was no way they would have done something like that.

In other words, Chu Feng was not only monstrously talented, but he had the backing of the top powers in the Holy Light Galaxy as well.

This realization made the crowd astonished. Many of them made up their minds to make sure to never offend this Chu Feng. Otherwise, they could very well die a tragic death.

“Brother Jin’an, thank you for your help earlier on,” Chu Feng clasped his fist and thanked Shengguang Jin’an.

He knew that Shengguang Jin’an had come here specially to help him out.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re too courteous. It’s for young master Shengguang’s own good that I stopped him too. We, as members of the Holy Light Clan, should strive to set a leading example for others instead of defying the rules set by our Clan Chief,” Shengguang Jin’an explained with a smile.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng nodded with a smile. There was some sense in what Shengguang Jin’an had just said.

“Brother Chu Feng, I’m looking forward to your performance in the tournament. I hope that you won’t let me down,” Shengguang Jin’an said.

“Brother Jin’an, you need not worry about that. I’ll give it my best for the tournament, or else I’ll only be letting down everyone who has put their trust in me,” Chu Feng replied.

“That’s good. I’ll be meeting you at the Storm Combat Dragon Ring then,” Shengguang Jin’an said.

“Storm Combat Dragon Ring? Young master Jin’an, are you saying that the tournament will be held at the Storm Combat Dragon Ring?”

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others asked. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

There were many notable figures present in the field that had looks of anticipation on their faces too.

So far, they only knew that the tournament would be held in this realm, but they had no idea where the specific location was.

However, they had heard of the Storm Combat Dragon Ring before.

“Right, it’s that Storm Combat Dragon Ring. In truth, the Holy Light Clan would be announcing the location of the Storm Combat Dragon Ring today,” Shengguang Jin’an said.

Hearing Shengguang Jin’an’s confirmation, Long Xiaoxiao and the juniors clenched their fists tightly in excitement.

After chatting a while longer, Shengguang Jin’an took his leave.

After that, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others quickly asked Chu Feng about Shengguang Jin’an, curious to know just who he was.

Chu Feng told them how he came to meet Shengguang Jin’an in the Nine Souls Galaxy, but aside from that, he didn’t really know anything about the latter at all.

“Right. What kind of place is that Storm Combat Dragon Ring that was mentioned earlier?”

Chu Feng noticed the huge reaction from the crowd when the Storm Combat Dragon Ring was mentioned, so he was curious to know just what was so special about that place.
