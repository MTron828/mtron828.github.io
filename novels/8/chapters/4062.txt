Chapter 4062 - Xuanming Family

“Chu Feng, are you serious? There’s a vast sea of Purple Star Wisteria here?”

Upon hearing Chu Feng’s words, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were originally planning to proceed straight for the Purple Star Hall all stopped. They all landed at the location where Chu Feng had indicated that there was a vast sea of Purple Star Wisterias.

However, they were unable to detect anything. No matter whether they used their feet to stomp on the ground or used their hands to move the ground, the area was completely devoid of flowers. It just seemed like an ordinary grass field, not a sea of flowers.

“Wait a moment.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he closed his eyes and sat down cross-legged.

Seeing this, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all revealed looks of expectation.

They knew Chu Feng’s personality, and knew that he was not someone that boasted without confidence. Since he said there was a sea of Purple Star Wisterias there, it would mean that there must be a sea of Purple Star Wisterias here.

......

Places with teleportation formations would inevitably have cultivators.

This was even more so for an extremely bustling Upper Realm like the Purple Star Upper Realm.

A lot of travelers were gathered outside the teleportation formation.

However, at that moment, all of them had stopped, and were observing the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The Chu Heavenly Clan had dispatched a lot of people.

Them appearing from the teleportation formation in a grandiose manner was very eye-catching to begin with.

On top of that, the Chu Heavenly Clan were very unfamiliar faces to the cultivators there.

Because of that, whilst the residential cultivators of the Purple Star Upper Realm wondered who the Chu Heavenly Clansmen might be, the great majority of them maintained an attitude of respect and reverence.

Of course, there were exceptions to the case amongst the bystanders.

“Chu Heavenly Clan?”

“This power is the new overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield?”

“How could they be this weak? How come I can’t even sense the aura of an Utmost Exalted amongst them?”

“Don’t speak nonsense. Perhaps they possess hidden dragons and crouching tigers, and are deliberately concealing their cultivations?”

“Hahaha, stop joking around. The news has long spread. That Chu Heavenly Clan is nothing more than a puny little clan. They’re nothing more than the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s lackeys.”

“The only reason they were able to become the overlord’s of the Ancestral Martial Starfield is all because of the protection of Ancestral Martial Dragon City. As for their own strength, they’re unbearably weak. They’re nothing more than trash that cannot even be ranked amongst the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Who would’ve thought that trash like them would actually dare come to the Purple Star Hall? They’re truly thick-skinned.”

A group of five or six were echoing one another and insulting the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Furthermore, they were speaking very loudly. They were deliberately having the people present hear their conversation.

When their conversations were heard by the crowd, the crowd mostly expressed skepticism, but also began to gesticulate at the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The gazes with which they looked at the Chu Heavenly Clan were no longer filled with reverence and respect like before.

“Those bastards, I’ll go teach them a lesson.”

At that moment, there were Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were unable to tolerate the constant insults, and wanted to attack that group of people.

“Stop.”

However, right after that person stepped forward, he was immediately pulled back by a Chu Heavenly Clan elder.

“How many times must we teach you? When outside, act with a low profile.”

“The world of martial cultivators is one with many people far more talented than you. Do you even know who they are?”

“Look at the title plates on their waists,” the elder criticized them.

Hearing those words, many Chu Heavenly Clansmen carefully examined those people.

Upon doing so, they discovered that the group of people that had insulted them were all wearing the same attire.

Not only that, but they also had the same title plates on their waist.

Not only was that title plate very exquisite, but the words ‘Xuanming Family’ were also inscribed on them.

“Ssss~~~”

Upon seeing the words inscribed on the title plates, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that had been planning to attack those people immediately sucked in a mouthful of cold air. They were so scared that they did not even have the courage to look those people in the eye.

Seeing the reaction of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, the group from the Xuanming Family became even more pleased with themselves.

“So it’s actually people from the Xuanming Family.”

“In that case, it would appear that what they’ve said is the truth.”

“This group of people from the Chu Heavenly Clan are really the current overlord’s of the Ancestral Martial Starfield...”

“But, why are they this weak?”

Soon, the Purple Star Upper Realm’s resident cultivators noticed the identity of the group of people.

With that, their skepticism toward the words those people had said earlier completely disappeared.

In an instant, the crowd all began to speak with cutting remarks about the Chu Heavenly Clan.

The reason for this sudden change was due to the origin of the Xuanming Family.

This Xuanming Family was an overlord of one of the Ten Abandoned Starfields, the Xuanming Starfield. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

As the gatherings of the Ten Abandoned Starfields were usually organized by the Purple Star Hall, the overlord-level powers of the ten starfields were frequent visitors to the Purple Star Hall.

As such, the Xuanming Family was well-known to the people of the Purple Star Upper Realm.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, in the distance, golden light radiated all around.

Looking over, it was a vast expanse of golden auspicious clouds. Like a tsunami of gold, the clouds raged in the sky, and surged towards that place at a rapid speed.

Under the vast and imposing momentum, the clouds arrived before the crowd in the blink of an eye and stopped.

Looking up, everyone could see giant beasts, temporary palaces and a vast army within the golden clouds.

Most importantly, at the waists of those people were identical title plates.

Xuanming Family.

This was actually the Xuanming Family’s army.

When the Xuanming Family’s army arrived, the noisy crowd instantly grew quiet.

Oppression. It was the oppression brought forth by a major power.

Even though the Purple Star Upper Realm was far superior to the Abandoned Starfields, and the cultivators of the Purple Star Upper Realm had a certain sense of superiority over those from the Abandoned Starfields, ordinary cultivators would still express reverence and fear towards the Abandoned Starfields’ overlord powers like the Xuanming Family.

After the Xuanming Family’s army arrived, a man walked out of the largest and most luxurious palace.

The man resembled a youth, and was very handsome. His outfit was also very tasteful.

However, his bearing was a total mess.

In his left hand was an entire roast pork leg. In his right hand was a jug of wine.

He bit into the pork and drank his wine as he tottered out.

Logically, this wasn’t very different or abnormal. After all, he was just eating and drinking, enjoying what everyone enjoyed.

Although cultivators had long broken free from the needs of sustenance, and could remain alive just by refining natural energies without needing to eat or drink, enjoying delicacies was still something that most people were fond of.

However, that individual’s eating manners were truly ugly.

Oil stained his face, and wine had been spewn all over his clothes. It made him appear very shabby.

However, when this shabby-looking person appeared, the Xuanming Family’s army actually all respectfully bowed their heads to him.

From this, one could tell that that person possessed an extraordinary status.

The man continued to eat his pork leg as he walked out.

He was sweeping his gaze ahead the entire time.

Finally, his gaze landed on the Chu Heavenly Clan’s banner.

“Chu Heavenly Clan?”

“Hahaha!”

Upon seeing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s banner, the man laughed out loud.

His laughter caused the pork and wine in his mouth to splatter everywhere.

However, he was laughing very heartily.

“It actually really is the Chu Heavenly Clan. They really came.”

“Courageous, courageous.”

“When the Wuming Clan arrives at the Purple Star Hall, they’re only helping themselves to be humiliated.”

“Never would I have imagined that the ones coming from the Ancestral Martial Starfield this year would be even weaker.”

“I’ve heard that their clan chief doesn’t even possess the cultivation of a rank one Utmost Exalted.” The man had begun spewing insult the Chu Heavenly Clan without restraint.
