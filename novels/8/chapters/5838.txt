Chapter 5839: The Formation Core Surfaces, the Ancestral Martial Galaxy is in Danger

“Puppeteer Exalted, your formation is useless,” the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief bellowed. His clansmen were paying a heavy price to channel this formation, but it was unable to breach the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation despite its astounding power.

“Calm down. Everything is under control.”

Puppeteer Exalted changed his hand seal, and the massive light pillar changed.

Countless runes reminiscent of locusts surfaced from the light pillar, hopped onto the protective formation, and swiftly crawled all over it. They moved at speeds far faster than even ancient teleportation formations, such that it didn’t take long to cover the entire protective formation.

“Activate!” Puppeteer Exalted roared.

The runes emanated bizarre glows that shone through the protective formation onto the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s realms. All of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s realms were initially emitting the same light, but their lights quickly dimmed under the bizarre glow.

There was only one realm that continued glowing brightly, as if unaffected by the formation.

“See, it has shown itself.” Puppeteer Exalted laughed gleefully. He turned to the six leaders of the Ancient Era’s clans and said, “That is the main formation core of the protective formation, and it can only be channeled by juniors. My formation creates a passageway that allows us to bypass the protective formation and send juniors in.”

“Is there a risk?” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master asked.

“There will be, but they will be fine as long as they consume my medicine,” Puppeteer Exalted said. He waved his hands, and countless medicinal bottles fell into the hands of the six leaders of the Ancient Era’s clans.

The six leaders inspected the bottles, but they eventually turned their eyes toward the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master. The latter was the only Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist among them.

“It would indeed protect our juniors,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master replied.

“Milords, you can’t achieve great things without taking a bit of risk. Besides, are you that unconfident in your juniors?” Puppeteer Exalted asked.

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master waved his hand, and the medicinal bottles fell into the hands of his juniors. The juniors gulped down the medicine before stepping into the formation’s eighth formation core.

Among these juniors was the grandson of the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master, Zhao Gongyi. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The other five leaders of the Ancient Era’s clans also had their respective juniors consume the medicine and make their way toward the eighth formation core.

Once all of the juniors were standing in the eighth formation core, Puppeteer Exalted took out a second flag and formed a hand seal. The flag quickly enlarged, and he planted it on the ground. Then, he changed his hand seal once more.

Weng!

A second spirit formation gate that looked incredibly small compared to the first appeared in outer space. It released a black light pillar that looked equally insignificant compared to the brilliant light pillar coming from the first.

If the first light pillar was an elephant’s foot, the second one was just a thin line.

But somehow, the much weaker black light pillar pierced through the protective formation and shot straight toward the only realm that remained lit in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

“This is bad.”

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, who had channeled her full power into the formation, turned pale.

“What’s wrong?” The experts of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and the Holy Valley turned to her.

“They have found the realm where our juniors are channeling our protective formation’s main formation core, and they have launched an attack at it. Their means are incredible. They might breach our defenses very soon,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

“Isn’t there a powerful formation imbued on the realm, such that only juniors can enter the premises?” the Holy Master asked.

“That’s right, but do you think our juniors stand a chance against their juniors?” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster asked.

All of the experts from the Holy Valley and the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect fell silent. Their concern was palpable. The crux to the protective formation was in that realm, and only juniors could enter and channel the formation core.

The most powerful juniors of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, including those from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and the Holy Valley, were currently there.

“Master, I’ll head there,” a voice echoed. It came from an incomparably beautiful woman wearing a purple dress.

“Zi Ling, you’re suffering a backlash from backing out of your closed-door training. You can’t make a move now,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

Zi Ling was in a crucial phase in her closed-door training, but she forcefully snapped out of it upon learning about the difficulties they were facing, and that resulted in her incurring severe injuries. Fighting in her current state would only worsen her injuries.

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster kept Zi Ling by her side because she was worried something would happen to the latter.

“Master, let me go. It’ll be best if they fail to breach our formation, but if they do, we’d at least stand a fighting chance if I’m there. Otherwise, if our protective formation unravels, our entire galaxy will suffer,” Zi Ling said.

“Lord Sectmaster, Miss Zi Ling is right,” the Holy Master said.

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster formed a hand seal, and a spirit formation gate surfaced. On the other side of the spirit formation gate was the realm where the main formation core was.

“Go on, Zi Ling, but you have to return alive. Otherwise, I won’t be able to face Chu Feng. He’s much stronger than me now. I won’t be able to deal with him if he comes after me,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

“Rest assured, master,” Zi Ling said before stepping into the spirit formation gate.

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Duan Liufeng looked at his sectmaster and asked, “Lord Sectmaster, are the rumors about the Nine Heavens’ Zenith true?”

The experts channeling the formation turned to look at the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. This included Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, Daoist Niantian, and the others...

As closed off as the Ancestral Martial Galaxy was, they, as the upper echelons of the galaxy, were still aware of recent happenings. They had heard about the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, as well as Chu Feng’s conflict with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

It was just that they hadn’t had time to verify the news before hearing that someone was planning to attack the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster immediately contacted the Holy Valley’s Holy Master, requesting the latter to mobilize everyone in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy to channel their protective formation.

This formation was created by the founder of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and it enveloped the entire Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

Upon careful consideration, the Holy Master chose to work with the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. He knew better than to expect compassion from bandits. Those powerhouses wouldn’t hesitate to massacre their people.

That resulted in their current situation.
