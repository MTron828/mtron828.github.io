MGA: Chapter 1228 - Guilty And Deserves To Be Punished

“Ye Qing, is there anything else you wish to say?” Chu Feng had a smile on his face as he crouched down and looked at Ye Qing before him.

“Chu Feng, I...”

“Wuuwaa~~”

Ye Qing wanted to try and explain himself. However, to his surprise, Chu Feng suddenly stomped down with his foot and ruthlessly crushed down on his abdomen.

Chu Feng’s stomp not only directly snapped apart Ye Qing’s back bone, it also caused him to vomit out a mouthful of blood.

“Ye Qing, what are you doing?”

Right at this moment, an angry shout sounded. Following that, two figures landed from the sky. These two people were Elder Wei and Elder Zhou Quan.

“Elders, save me! Chu Feng is trying to kill me!” When Ye Qing saw these two management elders, he displayed an expression of seeing his savior. Disregarding the pain of a broken back, he mustered his strength and crawled toward the two elders, hugging Elder Zhou Quan’s thigh.

Elder Wei lowered his head and asked, “Ye Qing, you said that Chu Feng was trying to kill you?”

“That’s right, it’s Chu Feng, he’s trying to kill me. Out of good intentions, I invited him to have dinner. However, who would’ve thought that he felt that I would affect his future prospects, become an obstruction to him in the Medicine Concocting Department and ultimately decide to kill me. If it wasn’t for elders’ prompt arrival, I fear that I would’ve lost my life tragically here today.”

“This Chu Feng is truly too vicious. We are of the same school, yet he actually possesses such malicious intents toward me. Elders, you must uphold justice for me.” Ye Qing feigned a very wronged appearance and began to countercharge Chu Feng, placing all the evil deeds that he had done onto Chu Feng.

“Pow.” However, who would’ve thought that right at this moment, Elder Zhou Quan who had not spoken the entire time actually gave Ye Qing a resounding slap to the face.

His slap was very powerful. Not only did it make half of Ye Qing’s face concave, leaving it with a large handprint and bloody bruises, it also nearly shattered half of Ye Qing’s skull.

“Ahhh~~~~~”

The sudden slap caused Ye Qing to roll around on the ground. Being incapable of speaking, he could only scream in pain. However, in addition to the pain, he was also filled with confusion.

He did not understand why Elder Zhou Quan, who always loved him dearly, would suddenly slap him.

“Ye Qing, you can stop pretending. The two elders have seen all that happened earlier.”

“Your true appearance is already exposed. For you to still try to frame Chu Feng, can you be any more shameless?” Right at this moment, Bai Ruochen slowly walked out from the forest.

Hearing those words, Ye Qing suddenly came to a realization. In an instant, his face turned ashen, he laid on the ground and began to tremble nonstop. However, even so, he did not dare to say anything. That was because he knew that a great catastrophe was about to befall him.

“You animal. I have thought of you so highly in vain. Never would I have imagined that you’re this despicable. I, Zhou Quan, was truly blind to have invited you into our Medicine Concocting Department.”

Elder Zhou Quan gnashed his teeth. His eyes were deep red and killing intent filled his body, causing the entire region to tremble violently. From this, it could be seen that he was truly enraged.

“If we are to bring him back to the Punishment Department and report his crimes, it would be a disgrace to our Medicine Concocting Department. However, to keep such a disciple would only bring about more trouble. Sooner or later, he will definitely try to do something malicious again. Thus, it is better to settle this matter on the spot.”

“Zhou Quan, he is a disciple that you invited. You should personally deal with him,” Elder Wei said.

“Rest assured, faced with trash disciples like him, I, Zhou Quan, will definitely not be lenient.” Zhou Quan waved his sleeve. Immediately, the sky turned dark and a gale surged forth. As this aura that seemed to be able to bring about destruction to the world spread about, this region of space seemed to be about to meet its end. The might of a Half Martial Emperor was truly frightening, and not something that a Martial King could compare with.

At the moment when the sky turned clear, Ye Qing had already turned into a pile of white bones. There was no trace of life in him anymore. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Chu Feng, Ye Qing tried to bring harm toward you. Thus, his source energy shall be yours. Consider it compensation,” Elder Zhou said.

“Thank you elder,” Hearing that, Chu Feng did not hesitate. He opened his mouth and sucked Ye Qing’s source energy from his pile of bones.

Even though Ye Qing’s source energy was not of much use to the current Eggy, Chu Feng was not someone to waste a free meal.

“Boom.” When Chu Feng finished absorbing Ye Qing’s source energy, Elder Zhou Quan waved his sleeve once again and caused a burst of wind to appear. This gale directly crushed Ye Qing’s bones till there was nothing remaining.

Even though Elder Zhou Quan’s methods were ruthless and he had an angry expression on his face the entire time, Chu Feng noticed that there was a trace of sadness in his eyes.

No matter what, Ye Qing was a disciple that Elder Zhou Quan had thought very highly of. Furthermore, he had taught Ye Qing a lot of his knowledge. Thus, even though he had to die for his dreadful crimes, that Elder Zhou Quan would feel sad about it was also normal.

Chu Feng did not feel antipathy toward Elder Zhou Quan’s sentiments. Instead, his favorable impression of Elder Zhou Quan increased. That was because Elder Zhou Quan’s reaction showed that he was someone who could distinguish right from wrong, yet was also very affectionate and true.

“Chu Feng, keep that boulder over there. That is a treasure capable of increasing the power of your spirit formations. Especially killing formations, it would be able to make them even stronger.”

“Keep this too. Like Ye Qing’s source energy, consider it compensation.” As Elder Zhou Quan spoke, he threw a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng. It was Ye Qing’s Cosmos Sack.

“Thank you, Elder Zhou.” After he received the Cosmos Sack, Chu Feng had a smile on his face. That was because there were quite a few treasures in Ye Qing’s Cosmos Sack. Not only were there several quality Royal Armaments, there were also many rare and strange treasures. Especially medicine concocting materials, there was a lot more than what Chu Feng himself possessed.

After that, Chu Feng retrieved the boulder as well. That was because the boulder was also a treasure; it was actually even more precious than the items in the Cosmos Sack. If one could utilize the boulder properly, one would be able to bring about an exceptional power.

“Someone’s coming.” Suddenly, Elder Wei cast his sharp gaze to the distant horizon.

Sure enough, three figures soon flew over. They were people from the Nine Spirits Paradise.

When the three of them descended, they first courteously greeted Elder Wei and Elder Zhou Quan. Only then did they say, “Seniors, Lord Sima has finished setting up the formation. He wishes to invite you all back to the cave.”

“Oh? He actually finished this quickly?” Hearing those words, Elder Wei was a bit startled. However, his surprise was soon replaced with happiness.

“That’s right, it was much faster than what we thought it would take.” Elder Zhou Quan also displayed an expression of happiness. It seemed he had completely forgotten about the sorrow from Ye Qing’s death. The opening of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram was simply too alluring to gold-cloak world spiritists.

Just like this, being led by these two management elders, Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen returned to the cave.

At this moment, Chu Feng discovered that there were quite a few elders from the Medicine Concocting Department already in the cave. Furthermore, under the guidance of the people from the Nine Spirits Paradise, more and more elders from the Medicine Concocting Department returned to the cave. Each and every one of them had expressions of anticipation.

At this moment, what attracted Chu Feng and everyone else’s attention was the formation in the depths of the cave.

This formation was not very large. Furthermore, from looking at it, one could not tell what was powerful about this formation.

However, with a single glance, one could tell that this formation was, in fact, extremely profound and extraordinary.

At this moment, Sima Huolie and Elder Hong Mo were respectively sitting on the two sides of the formation and resting with their eyes closed.

It was evident that they were finished setting up this formation.
