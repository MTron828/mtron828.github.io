Chapter 5540: Ambitions Revealed

Shoosh!

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master waved his sleeves and the map of the Immemorial Star Sea appeared on one of the palace’s walls. A road leading from the perimeter of the Immemorial Star Sea to the stone monument was indicated on the map.

“Do you remember this road? It was the one Chu Feng discovered. He even brought your son and daughter along with him,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“I remember it,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

Both Long Chengyu and Long Muxi had to retreat because they were unable to withstand the energy. Chu Feng managed to get to the end of the road, but he failed to find anything.

“I heard that Chu Feng was the one who saved everyone in the formation?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master suddenly asked.

“None of the juniors who entered that realm would have been alive now if not for young friend Chu Feng,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

“He has a bright future ahead of him,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master remarked.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t respond to that remark. He could tell that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had a high opinion of Chu Feng, but that was only normal, considering how insanely talented Chu Feng was as a cultivator and a world spiritist.

It was hard not to admire someone as talented as that.

Had it been in the past, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief would have taken this opportunity to recommend Chu Feng to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, but he had no desire to do so now…

After a brief sigh, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master continued, “That road isn’t exclusive to juniors. I discovered it before Chu Feng and stumbled upon a secret that has something to do with that assimilation formation.”

“What did you uncover?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“I learned that something was going to happen to the Immemorial Star Sea. A spirit formation gate would surface, and within it was a formation awaiting completion. Only juniors possessing the monstrous beast bloodline would be able to enter the gate and complete the formation.

“I’ll be frank with you. The information I received was that Tian’er would receive a huge advantage if the formation was completed, which was why I requested your help. I didn’t think that it was an assimilation formation,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

“You’re saying that you were tricked?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Indeed.” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master nodded.

“Was it a being residing in the Immemorial Star Sea?”

“It must be. It couldn’t have been someone from our world of cultivation. I’m not sure what kind of entity it is, but again, isn’t it only normal for there to be descendants of ancient races in a place like this?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief agreed. There were indeed records of cultivators stumbling upon ancient races living in seclusion while exploring ancient remnants.

“Wouldn’t that mean that your Tian’er is in danger?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I have no doubt that there’s something amiss about the Immemorial Star Sea, but I believe that my Tian’er can deal with it. If he is unable to cope, I can only say that he has it coming,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

Those words suggested that he had great confidence in Jie Tian, but it also showed that he didn’t care much about Jie Tian’s safety.

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, even if what you have told me thus far is true, it doesn’t explain your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion saving the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan. You knew what the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan did to my predecessors. You knew that our clans were on bad terms, but you still had our juniors enter that blasted place with those little bastards. Many of our juniors were killed by them. How are you going to justify that?

“I took you as a friend, Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, but I don’t think you do the same. You should have at least given me a heads-up. I can only see nothing but malice from your decision to conceal this matter from me,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“I concede, Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, that I do have my selfish motives for concealing the involvement of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan from you, which is why I told you that I’d offer you a huge benefit if you accomplish this task for me. This benefit concerns the future of your entire Totem Dragon Clan,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master said.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was slightly consoled by those words.

He knew that if the Totem Dragon Clan really waged war against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, it would suffer severe damage regardless of the final outcome. Other powers would exploit their weakness to uproot them. It was nothing but foolishness to wage a war against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion at this juncture, during God’s Era.

He had only said those words to demand compensation. As long as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion offered sufficient compensation, the Totem Dragon Clan could swallow this grievance down.

In the first place, he hadn’t helped the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master out of anything as naive as friendship. Powerhouses like them only collaborated on the basis of mutual interest; there was no true friendship between them.

While the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master didn’t explicitly mention what kind of benefit it was, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief knew that the other party had taken one of the greatest treasures regarding the prophecy of God’s Era.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master continued speaking, but the words he spoke stunned the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. For a moment, the latter thought that he was hearing things.

“The world of cultivation is in need of a leader given the current circumstances. Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, we’re on good terms. I don’t plan on making you my enemy, so I’m willing to take you under my wing. From this day onward, the Totem Dragon Clan will be under our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s protection. Of course, I trust that with your capabilities, you’d become one of my trusty aides too. When I finally unite the world of cultivation, your position will only be second to mine!”

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master looked at the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief with an amicable smile, but the latter didn’t feel the slightest goodwill at all. Instead, he only felt rage bubbling inside him.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had just bared his ambitions, and the Totem Dragon Clan was his first target!
