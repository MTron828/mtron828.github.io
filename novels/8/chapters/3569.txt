Chapter 3569 - I’ll Do It Alone

“Senior, is-is there t-truly n-nothing you can do? A-are you r-really unable to help him?”

“It’s f-fine if you ig-ignore the others. Y-you on-only need t-to save my brother,” said Wang Qiang.

“Oh my, you’re actually addressing me as senior, and not old fart?”

The undead man laughed. He looked at Wang Qiang with a profound gaze.

“Putt~~~”

Suddenly, Wang Qiang dropped to his knees before the undead man. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Senior, I b-beg of you.”

“I w-will definitely c-cooperate with w-what you want me to do.”

“T-truly, I b-beg of y-you. I cannot allow my b-brother to throw hi-himself into danger and l-look on w-with folded a-arms,” Wang Qiang spoke with a very honest look.

“Never would I expect that you’re actually such an affectionate and loyal person. After all, that’s the Four Fiends Divine Body you possess,” the undead man said.

“Senior, I-I beg of you,” Wang Qiang actually began to kowtow to the undead man.

“Get up,” the undead man waved his sleeve. Wang Qiang was forcibly brought back to his feet.

“I’m unable to help you. I’ve told you that it’s the Void Sacred Tree that allowed them to enter the Sacred Palace Hall. I am powerless to do anything.”

“Didn’t you think that your brother was very powerful? Why are you panicking now?” the undead man asked.

Upon learning that the undead man was truly unable to help him, Wang Qiang did not say anything. Instead, he turned to the lake, and looked at the vacant space being illuminated on the surface of the lake. Worry filled his eyes.

Seeing that, the undead man lay on the ground. The corners of his mouth rose into a curve. However, that smile of his was somewhat strange.

......

Jointly activating the power of the Void Sacred Tree, Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief managed to successfully bring the crowd into the depths of the Void Sacred Tree.

Chu Feng and the others had entered an isolated space.

The sky was pitch-black. However, faint light was being emitted from their surroundings. It was a formation as large and as far as the eye could see.

The crowd were all inside that formation, which stretched out in all directions.

It was like the crowd were surrounded by the formation. Furthermore, the formation was emitting a very dangerous aura. Because of that, no one dared to act rashly.

That said, the crowd’s gazes were all captured by a large banner between them.

After all, the characters written on that banner were truly too eye-catching.

‘Formation Breaching Banner!!!’

The crowd all understood that what they needed to do was likely related to the banner.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, light appeared in the pitch-black sky.

Looking upward, several large characters were present in the sky.

Those large characters were flickering with light, and appeared particularly dazzling.

They were hints!!!

Looking at the hints, the crowd realized that the formation that surrounded them was a giant maze formation.

The maze served as the chessboard, whereas the crowd were the chess pieces.

If the crowd could solve the chessboard, they would be able to enter the Sacred Palace Hall.

On the other hand, if one were to take the wrong path, the person who took that wrong path would die!!!

If the crowd was unable to solve the chessboard in two hours, all the people present would die.

Furthermore, the hint explicitly stated that everyone must participate.

However, the maze formation was so complicated that the crowd were simply unable to make sense of what they were looking at.

As far as the eye could see, expressions of confusion were present all over the crowd’s faces. They simply did not know how to begin, much less how to actually solve the maze.

“How could this be a ninety percent chance of death, this is simply an absolute death.”

After reading the hints, the crowd burst into an uproar. Feeling despair, they began to complain.

“Everyone, no one forced you to come in here. You made the decision to come here on your own. Yet, what are you all doing now? Who are you trying to blame?” Tantai Yinjian asked coldly. Displeasure was present in his voice.

“Lord Tantai, we have no intention of blaming anyone. Merely, with the current situation, exactly what are we to do?” The crowd asked.

“Lord Clan Chief,” the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen also turned their eyes to their clan chief.

However, neither Tantai Yinjian or the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief said anything.

At this moment, a single person was needed to take charge over the situation. Tantai Yinjian and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief were the most optimal choices. However, it was evident that neither of them possessed the confidence to lead the crowd. They seemed to also be at a loss as to what to do.

The crowd was also able to tell how difficult the situation was for Tantai Yinjian and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

As the people from the various powers would naturally not think highly of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief, they were forced to turn their eyes to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Clan Chief Chu, what do you think about this situation? How are we to breach this formation?” asked the crowd.

“I am ashamed, truly ashamed. This old man is truly unable to see through this formation at all,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shook his head.

“What are we to do about this situation?” Seeing that the three strongest individuals present were all helpless in the face of such a

crisis, the crowd once again entered a state of despair.

What they were worried about before was becoming that unlucky fellow that ended up dying by taking a wrong step.

But now, they were afraid that they would be trapped there till their deaths. As there was a time limit, all of them would die should two hours pass without them being able to breach the formation.

At that time, they did not even know what to do. Wouldn’t it mean that they would be simply waiting for death?

“Allow me,” right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard.

When that voice was heard, the crowd felt a slight tinge of joy.

However, they soon discovered that the person who had spoken was not the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, not Tantai Yinjian, and not the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Clan Chief.

Instead, it was Chu Feng!!!

“Young friend Chu Feng, this is no time to joke around.”

“Chu Feng, although you are exceptionally talented, so much that we all feel admiration for you, this is truly not a time for you to try to show off.”

After discovering that it was Chu Feng who had spoken, the crowd not only felt greater despair, but they even began to make cutting remarks at Chu Feng.

It was as they had said, they all felt admiration for Chu Feng’s talent. They all firmly believed that he would be able to do great things in the future.

Yet, if they were to be told to hand their lives to him now, they would be unwilling to do so.

“I am not joking, nor am I trying to show off. That said, everyone can rest assured too. I will not be using your lives to probe things out.”

“I will breach this formation myself,” said Chu Feng.

“Ah? What do you mean by that?”

“Young friend Chu Feng, what do you mean?”

The crowd looked to him with confusion.

“Was I not clear enough?”

“Very well, I’ll repeat myself.”

“I’m saying that you all do not have to do anything. You can just stand here and wait.”

“I, Chu Feng, will breach this formation on my own,” said Chu Feng.
