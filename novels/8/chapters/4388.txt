Chapter 4388: Thorough Defeat

When the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster realized that Chu Feng’s strength was nowhere lacking in comparison to Zhao Xuanhe, he clearly panicked.

He might have thought that Chu Feng was a lunatic at the start, but at this moment, it was apparent that this young man did possess some capabilities.

But soon, the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster calmed down yet again.

No matter what, he was still a world spiritist who had comprehended rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation.

He might not be able to tell the exact rank of Chu Feng’s Dragon Transformation Sensation, but he was still able to discern how powerful Chu Feng’s formation was.

And in truth, he wasn’t the only one who could do so.

While the spirit power Chu Feng had was on the same level as Zhao Xuanhe, the formation that he had set up was nothing impressive. He didn’t have Liu Shangwu’s exceptional control over spirit power nor Zhao Xuanhe’s treasure.

In fact, in terms of control over spirit power and ability to construct formations, he even paled in comparison to Zhao Xuanhe.

In the view of the crowd, even if Chu Feng had really comprehended the rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation, it was apparent that he was no match for Zhao Xuanhe.

Even if Zhao Xuanhe didn’t rely on his treasure, he would still have been able to easily defeat Chu Feng.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Soon, the time was up.

Without any hesitation, Zhao Xuanhe immediately launched his attack.

The offensive formation he had set up this time around was the same sword formation he had used to deal with Liu Shangwu.

Cold glints filled the sky as swords rained down upon Chu Feng.

Unlike the situation with Liu Shangwu, he didn’t tap into the power of his treasure, but at the same time, he didn’t hold back anything at all.

He didn’t want to waste time moving on to the second round.

Since they had gambled their lives here, no one would question him even if he were to kill Chu Feng straight away. So, his intention was actually to kill Chu Feng in the first round.

Pah pah pah pah!

The sword rain swiftly came into contact with Chu Feng’s defensive formation, and they actually stabbed through the formation. While it was only the tip that got by, such that the defensive formation wasn’t fully breached, nevertheless, it didn’t take long for the defensive formation to be riddled with holes.

“Indeed, that fellow’s formation is nothing at all!”

A smile crept onto the lips of the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster.

He usually played the role of a righteous and magnanimous man in public, so it was rare to see such a gleeful smile on his lips. However, he soon reined that smile back in.

As it turned out, a man was making his way toward him.

This man was dressed in ordinary clothes, and he had an ordinary appearance. At first glance, it would be hard to think of him as anyone significant.

He was the Sagacious Grandmaster’s servant, and he went by the name of Ordinary.

Even though Ordinary served the Sagacious Grandmaster as a servant, his strength was not to be underestimated. Not even the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster would dare to look down on him.

“Sectmaster Xu, someone is looking for you outside. He has identified himself as an elder of your Soaring Flower Sect,” Ordinary informed him softly.

As entry into this ancient castle was limited, even the elders of the Soaring Flower Gazebo could only wait outside.

Nevertheless, if it was an urgent matter, they could request for the servants of the ancient castle to report the matter.

“Oh? Can you get them to wait a little longer?”

The Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster didn’t want to leave at this moment. He wanted to watch with his own eyes how Zhao Xuanhe killed Chu Feng with his own hands.

“They said that there have been some complications at the mountain range. Sectmaster Xu, you can decide for yourself whether you wish to meet them or not.”

After saying his piece, Ordinary left the area.

As soon as Ordinary turned around and took his leave, the face of the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster immediately turned ugly.

‘Complications at the mountain range’, these five words were more than enough to let the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster realize that things had gone awry. So, he quickly rose to his feet and headed out.

Kacha!

Kacha!

Just as the Soaring Flower Gazebo’s sectmaster got up, Zhao Xuanhe managed to push his offense another step further through Chu Feng’s defensive formation.

The crack on the defensive formation was growing bigger and bigger, such that it felt like the formation would collapse very soon.

“Still persistently holding on, huh?” Zhao Xuanhe sneered disdainfully.

“I advise you not to break this formation of mine and leave a way out for yourself,” Chu Feng replied calmly.

“Oh? Are you getting afraid now? But it’s already too late for regrets!” Zhao Xuanhe smiled mockingly.

In response to that, Chu Feng smiled too and said, “I’m doing this for your own good.”

“That fellow, how can he be so shameless despite his young age?”

“Indeed. He’s obviously the one who is losing over here!”

“If he fears death, he could have just surrendered and asked for mercy. With Zhao Xuanhe’s personality, he wouldn’t make things difficult for him either. Yet, he just had to continue provoking Zhao Xuanhe. Such a person really deserves to die!”

“Sigh! So what if he has talent? He’s simply too conceited! Even if someone like him manages to mature, it might not necessarily be a good thing for the world!”

There were quite a few people amongst the crowd who began to mock Chu Feng. They had been fooled by the appearance that Zhao Xuanhe had put on all along.

They firmly believed that Liu Shangwu and Chu Feng were trying to frame Zhao Xuanhe from the start to the end, so their impression of Chu Feng was extremely bad.

Weng!

On the dueling ring, the formations shuddered as brilliant lights burst forth.

Countless swords made out of spirit power glimmered with incredible prowess.

This time around, Zhao Xuanhe didn’t want to waste any more time, so he began to activate the power of his treasure. In an instant, the prowess of his formation was raised to another level.

Chu Feng’s defensive formation couldn’t keep up with Zhao Xuanhe’s attacks anymore, and it looked as if it was going to break at any moment soon.

However, Chu Feng still asked unhurriedly, “Zhao Xuanhe, are you so eager to dive into your doom?”

Seeing how Chu Feng was still feigning composure even when he was already right before death’s door, Zhao Xuanhe raised his head and bellowed coldly, “You sure know how to talk tough. Let’s see how you deal with this!”

Right after he said those words, a resounding explosion echoed.

Zhao Xuanhe’s sword formation had finally breached Chu Feng’s defensive formation.

Peng!

But soon after, another resounding explosion sounded, and a completely unexpected sight occurred.

With Chu Feng at the center, a terrifying shockwave carrying overwhelming energy burst outward, tearing down all of the swords in the sky.

It swept across the surroundings at a maddeningly fast pace, devouring the entire dueling ring within the blink of an eye.

If not for the Sagacious Grandmaster sealing the dueling ring prior to the fight, the shockwave might have burst out of the dueling ring and rattled the whole ancient castle.

“That’s spirit power?!?!”

“Why would such a powerful pulsation of spirit power be released so suddenly?”

Even the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea was shocked by the devastating prowess that destroyed the whole dueling ring.

They could tell that the explosion was a manipulation of spirit power, but the prowess was so great that even the offensive formation set up by Zhao Xuanhe, despite being augmented by the treasure, was destroyed with ease.

But why would such frightening spirit power appear all of a sudden?

The crowd was baffled by the situation!

Soon, the spirit power began to fade.

To everyone’s shock, Chu Feng was still standing on the spot completely unharmed.

On the other hand, Zhao Xuanhe was lying by the corner with his robe completely destroyed. He had suffered a great deal of damage, such that he didn’t even have the strength to climb back up anymore.

“I warned you, but you courted your own death,” Chu Feng remarked with a mocking smile as he gazed down upon Zhao Xuanhe.

“Despicable... You despicable scum. You used the power of a treasure, that’s flouting the rules. Sagacious Grandmaster, you must punish him harshly!” Zhao Xunahe used the final bits of his strength to shout out those words.

He couldn’t accept this outcome. He was convinced that there was no way Chu Feng stood a chance against him, and that the latter must have relied on some treasure to turn the tables around.

Using treasures in this dueling ring was against the rules, and as the organizer of the tournament, there was no way the Sagacious Grandmaster would tolerate such an action!

“Young friend, your formation is truly ingenious. A defensive formation that carries offensive capabilities... You stored quite a bit of power inside the formation and made it such that it would be released as soon as the formation is breached.

“Zhao Xuanhe, that’s why this young friend over here kept advising you not to breach the formation. As soon as you get through it, the energy would rebound on you. This act is not a flotation of the rule. He set up this formation with his own spirit power and not through a treasure.

“Even though the two of you are almost equal in terms of power, your understanding and grasp over spirit power are on completely different levels. Zhao Xuanhe, you lost fair and square,” the Sagacious Grandmaster said.

Those words enlightened the confused crowd.

In an instant, the disdain they directed toward Chu Feng a moment ago vanished without a trace, replaced by admiration and awe instead.

Putting aside his character, the prowess of his world spiritist techniques was more than enough to win the respect of everyone present!
