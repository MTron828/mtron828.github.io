Chapter 5907: The Girl Who Fits the Traits of the Sacred Treasure

“Elder, you...” Chu Feng looked at the sky, realizing that the other party was just testing him out.

But why? Could it be that all of the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen are good people? Can such a strong existence accept the fact that an outsider stole their sacred treasure?

“Big brother Chu Feng.” Zi Ling, who didn’t know what was going on, walked up to Chu Feng with a worried frown.

“I’m fine. The pill wasn’t a poison but a cultivation resource. You can check if you’re worried.” Chu Feng lifted Zi Ling’s hand and placed it on his chest before freely revealing his physical condition to Zi Ling.

Zi Ling felt the powerful cultivation resource inside Chu Feng’s body and breathed a sigh of relief. She quickly turned to the sky and bowed. “Thank you, elder.”

Chu Feng did the same too.

“I’ve lived a long time and seen much. It’s not for me not to admire juniors who possess great talent but are still willing to sacrifice themselves for someone else. Of course, I am also hoping to accrue good karma for our Three Saints Monstrous Clan. You and your father are talented cultivators of the present era, and the two of you will likely achieve great things in the future.

“As for the sacred treasure, I still believe that our Three Saints Monstrous Clan has to take primary responsibility for its disappearance. Young friend, if you can find our sacred treasure and bring it back, I’ll grant you a handsome reward,” that person said.

“Elder, thank you for your magnanimity. I will not shirk off responsibility and do everything I can to bring back the sacred treasure.” Chu Feng was grateful from the bottom of his heart.

He felt that he and his father owed the Three Saints Monstrous Clan one for this, given how his father was the one who snuck the sacred treasure out of the Sacred Temple.

“Elder, can you provide me with some clues concerning the sacred treasure so that I can better find it?” Chu Feng asked.

“The sacred treasure exists as a gaseous black flame, but it’s able to morph into a human or other shapes. It should be relatively weak at the start, but it cultivates extremely fast and is very bloodthirsty. I have no doubt that the sacred treasure will go on a massacre after leaving the sacred mountain, so it is bound to leave a trail behind. It probably won’t attack you due to the formation your father planted on it back then. You should be able to find it based on these traits,” that person said.

Chu Feng’s heart jolted.

A person who shared the same traits came to his mind—the demonic being that appeared in the Great Chiliocosm Upper realm when he first returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

That demonic being massacred innocent people, prompting the Chu Heavenly Clan to pursue it. Chu Feng once investigated the matter too, and his investigation brought him before a little girl.

That little girl was incredibly powerful. The Chu Heavenly Clan wasn’t a match for her at all. Everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, including Chu Feng, should have been massacred, but in that critical moment, when Chu Feng approached her, she suddenly gained a conscience. Not only did she not hurt Chu Feng, but she even left straightaway.

Since then, there had been no news surrounding that little girl in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

The next time Chu Feng met that little girl was in the Nine Souls Galaxy.

She was being pursued by an envoy of the Netherworld Sect. She had hidden well, but just as Chu Feng was about to have a Netherworld Embryo planted into him, she suddenly emerged to save him.

Unfortunately, she wasn’t a match for the Netherworld Envoy and was caught.

The Netherworld Envoy took her and the little girl to the Netherworld Sect.

Back then, he was baffled as to why that girl was so friendly to him, but if what he had heard was true, it would all make sense. There was a good chance that the little girl was the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s sacred treasure.

There was just one thing that confused him.

While he felt the Darkness Monstrous God’s aura on the container of the sacred treasure, he didn’t sense that from the black jar, the black gaseous flames it emitted, or the little girl he met afterward.

Of course, that was not important. The person had already clarified that the black gaseous flame inside the black jar was the sacred treasure, so Chu Feng simply had to search based on that. Given so, the little girl should be his priority to investigate. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Elder, how do you intend to deal with the sacred treasure once it returns to your clan?” Chu Feng asked.

That little girl had once helped him, so he was worried about her plight.

“Our Three Saints Monstrous Clan has great use of the sacred treasure. You can be assured that it’ll have our respect. It’ll fare better in our Three Saints Monstrous Clan than wandering outside,” that person said.

“I will surely retrieve the sacred treasure,” Chu Feng said.

“You may go now.”

A surge of teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng and Zi Ling. By the time the teleportation energy dissipated, Chu Feng and Zi Ling had already returned to their previous position outside the sacred mountain.

“Big brother Chu Feng, where should we go?” Zi Ling asked.

There was still a worried frown on her face. The earlier encounter made her realize that there was a powerful existence in the Three Saints Monstrous Clan. They were lucky that person harbored no enmity toward them, or else they would have been in huge trouble.

“There’s one place I’d like to take a look at, but let’s return to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect first,” Chu Feng said.

He activated the teleportation formation and returned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. He was worried that Jie Tianran might beat him to the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city.

Now that he had a treasure to enhance his observation, he wanted to see if he could enter the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city ahead of Jie Tianran.

Meanwhile, at the sacred mountain’s peak, there was a palace even more majestic than the Sacred Temple in the sky. The palace doors were wide open, and a person was standing at its entrance.

That person looked incredibly low, so much so that its skin was covered with wrinkles and age spots. He must have lived for a long time. However, upon taking a closer look, his features bore a resemblance to the middle statue at the sacred mountain’s peak.

He had three eyes too, though his other features shared similarities too.

“You changed that poison pill into a cultivation resource. That’s not like you,” an old and hoarse voice echoed from the palace behind him. The voice sounded ailing like a sickly old man.

“Weren’t you the one who said that Chu Xuanyuan is performing exceptionally well in the Ninth Galaxy, and his potential is inestimable?” the three-eyed old man turned around and spoke. He had the same voice as the person who spoke with Chu Feng earlier.

“Many of the formation cores I left in the Ninth Galaxy have been destroyed, so the news I receive is limited. Even so, any news I receive concerning Chu Xuanyuan tends to be of great consequence. That brat is unfathomably strong.

“His son is formidable too, to possess such sharp observation and means despite being a junior. He was stronger than his father back then. The current generation of our Three Saints Monstrous Clan is the strongest ever, but none of our clansmen can match him. At this rate, he might just surpass Chu Xuanyuan.

“In any case, we shouldn’t offend both the father and the son,” the ailing voice inside the palace said.

“I never thought I would ever hear this word from the monstrous clan’s strongest world spiritist. Our old friends will burst into laughter if they hear that,” the three-eyed old man remarked with a chuckle.

“Times have changed. Look at the two of us and our tattered bodies. We might have to rely on them in the future,” that ailing voice replied mirthfully.
