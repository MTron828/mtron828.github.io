Chapter 2960 - Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes

The destruction brought about by the Nine-colored Divine Lightning that descended from the sky was very small. It was so small that it surpassed the crowd’s expectations.

However, the Nine-colored Divine Lightning had still destroyed the Heavenly Lightning Steps and injured Chu Feng.

Chu Feng’s injuries were very serious. Chu Xuanzhengfa called all of the best doctors in the Chu Heavenly Clan to treat Chu Feng’s injuries together. They used countless precious healing medicines and spent a total of nine days and nine nights to barely bring Chu Feng back from the gates of hell.

However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng still did not recover completely, and was still unconscious.

That said, they had, nevertheless, saved Chu Feng’s life.

When the news of Chu Feng still being alive was sent out, the entire Chu Heavenly Clan grew quieter.

There were people that were secretly delighted. The return of the exiled trash that was actually a heaven-defying genius. That was something that would be beneficial to their Chu Heavenly Clan.

That said, there were also people that were depressed. With how overwhelmingly talented Chu Feng was, his nurturing would definitely be emphasized by the Chu Heavenly Clan. This was extremely detrimental to those that disliked Chu Xuanyuan or were enemies of Chu Xuanyuan.

If Chu Feng was to rise, Chu Xuanyuan would, sooner or later, be set free.

That being said, Chu Feng had no idea what was happening outside at all.

He only felt himself feeling very muddleheaded for a long time. It was as if he had been trapped somewhere and was unable to escape. Inevitably, he began to panic.

Finally, a beam of light appeared before his eyes. Chu Feng started to strive for that light. Finally... his eyes became clear.

Chu Feng had woken up. When he woke up, he discovered that he was lying on a special bed ,and by his bedside was a woman.

That woman was currently blinking her large eyes and looking at him.

“Chu Feng, you’ve woken up? That’s great!”

Upon seeing Chu Feng regaining consciousness, the woman was wild with joy.

“You are?” Chu Feng still had a very intense headache. His consciousness was still not very clear. However, he was certain that he did not know the woman. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You don’t know me?”

“Aiya, I’ve nearly forgotten. Yes, you don’t know me.”

“However, I know you. I know everything that happened to you in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. You still remember Chu Bore, no? I used to follow him and was in charge of monitoring things in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” The woman said.

“So that’s the case. No wonder you know me then,” Chu Feng smiled. Then, he said, “Then, how should I address you?”

“I am called Chu Yue. If you don’t mind, you can call me big sister Chu Yue,” The Woman said.

“Chu Yue?” Chu Feng was slightly startled upon hearing that name.

It was such a familiar name. Back in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm’s Nine Provinces Continent’s Chu Family, there had also been a person called Chu Yue who had looked at Chu Feng with a beautiful, bright and comforting smile like the woman before him.

Chu Yue was Chu Feng’s older paternal cousin. Although they did not possess a blood relationship, she treated Chu Feng extremely well, like an actual blood sister.

Thus, Chu Feng started feeling very amiable upon hearing the name Chu Yue.

Seeing Chu Feng acting somewhat absent-minded, Chu Yue asked, “What’s wrong?”

“It’s nothing. I’ll call you big sis Chu Yue then,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Sure, it’s all the same,” Seeing that Chu Feng was really addressing her as ‘big sis,’ Chu Yue felt very happy.

Although she was not present when Chu Feng ascended to the Heavenly Lightning Steps’ tenth step outside the main city’s entrance, she had heard from Chu Huai how astonishing that scene was.

Chu Feng was no longer exiled trash. He had been acknowledged by their Utmost Exalted Elder. At present, he was a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Furthermore, with Chu Feng’s talent, his nurture would definitely be emphasized by the Chu Heavenly Clan.

It was most definitely a good thing to make good connections with a person like Chu Feng.

“Big sis Chu Yue, how long have I been unconscious?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’ve been unconscious for ten days now. Fortunately, you’ve woken up. Do you know how many people are worried about you?”

“Lil brother Chu Feng, I will go and inform everyone that you’ve woken up so as to prevent them from worrying about you,” Chu Yue said.

“Very well,” Chu Feng nodded.

“Wait here a moment. I will go call the doctor too,” After saying those words, Chu Yue left.

“Wuu~~~”

After Chu Yue left, Chu Feng suddenly felt his head aching enormously. He felt as if his head were about to explode.

Strangely, as his head started hurting, it also started feeling much clearer. As the headache subsided, Chu Feng managed to wake up completely.

However, when Chu Feng completely awoke, he was stunned.

At that moment, a sort of power appeared in Chu Feng’s head.

It resembled a martial skill, but wasn’t a martial skill. It wasn’t a secret skill either. This item was connected to his soul and bloodline.

It was a technique related to his bloodline. Not only did it possessed a clear training method, but it also possessed a name.

It was called the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.

“Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes? Could this be the Nine-colored Divine Lightning that descended from the sky and struck my body?”

Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.

It turned out that the Nine-colored Divine Lightning that struck down from the heavens was not trying to kill him. Rather, it was entering his body.

It was because the Nine-colored Divine Lightning was too powerful that Chu Feng’s body ended up shattering, and his soul was injured in the process too.

That said, without a doubt, being struck by the Nine-colored Divine Lightning was definitely worth it.

Chu Feng was able to tell that the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes was stronger than any technique that he had learned before. In fact, it could be said that neither martial skills, Immortal Techniques nor secret skills could compare with the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.

If other techniques were soldiers or generals, then the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes would be the king.
