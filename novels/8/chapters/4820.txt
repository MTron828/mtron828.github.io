Chapter 4820: The Happenings

The sectmaster explained what was going on.

The reason why the sectmaster and Duan Liufeng visited the Seven Realms Galaxy was to find the elder of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect in hopes that he might have a solution for the calamity.

However, the sectmaster didn’t even know what the name of the elder was. She only knew that he was residing in True Essence Mountain of the Ninestream Starfield’s Heavenly Omen Upper Realm.

They thought that it would take some time to find the elder, but to their surprise, the elder had already come out of his seclusion. His powerful prowess made him a known figure not just in the Ninestream Starfield but in the other starfields too.

No one knew of his name or background, so they respectfully addressed him as True Essence Exalted instead.

Various powers had extended a hand to him, hoping to bring him over to their side, but True Essence Exalted rejected all of them, though he did express his willingness to guide their juniors.

Most juniors who received True Essence Exalted’s guidance would undergo significant growth. So, most powers hoped that their juniors would be able to receive his guidance.

However, as more and more juniors came knocking at his door, True Essence Exalted soon found himself struggling to keep up with them. So, he chose to set up formations around True Essence Mountain such that only the juniors who managed to overcome the barriers would be able to get to him and receive his guidance.

This was the only way to meet True Essence Exalted at the moment.

However, the fact that only juniors were allowed to scale the mountain stumped both the sectmaster and Duan Liufeng.

However, they weren’t willing to turn back just like that either. So, they chose to use a treasure to conceal Duan Liufeng’s age and have him scale the mountain as a junior while the sectmaster waited at the bottom of the mountain for his return.

Unfortunately, she soon received a call for help from Duan Liufeng. His disguise had been seen through by one of the formations, resulting in him getting trapped in it. He couldn’t continue scaling the mountain to meet True Essence Exalted anymore, and he might even meet with danger.

It was only then that the sectmaster realized that she had underestimated that elder.

So, she returned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to fetch Chu Feng, Zi Ling, Zuoqiu Youyu, and the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple over and entrusted them with two missions.

One was to save Duan Liufeng, and the other was to meet with True Essence Exalted and relay the current situation at the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to him.

The benefit was that they would be able to receive the guidance of True Essence Exalted if they managed to meet him, and that was also the opportunity the sectmaster mentioned.

Zuoqiu Youyu soon regained his consciousness, and he was quickly briefed on the goal of their trip too.

The teleportation formation was indeed formidable. In just five short days, they managed to traverse across numerous galaxies to arrive at the faraway Seven Realms Galaxy.

Chu Feng couldn’t help but feel a little agitated when he stepped out of the teleportation formation.

There was nothing special about the scenery before him, but he knew that he was stepping on the ground of the Seven Realms Galaxy, the territory of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

That was the powerhouse that he would have to challenge one day, just that he was still too weak at the moment.

However, there was no time for him to be thinking about all these because True Essence Mountain was just right ahead of them. Some time had passed since Duan Liufeng got trapped, and they had no idea what his current predicament was.

So, Chu Feng and the others quickly entered True Essence Mountain without any hesitation.

There was a barrier around True Essence Mountain that only allowed juniors to enter. Even experts on the caliber of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster weren’t able to step onto the mountain.

From this, it could be seen that the barrier was truly formidable.

On the outside, True Essence Mountain didn’t look too big, but it would appear as if one was in the boundless wilderness once one stepped in. This was caused by the power of treasures and formations.

If one were to walk blindly in there, one would never reach the peak of True Essence Mountain even if one were to walk for a lifetime. To get there, one had to find the correct road and pass through it the correct way.

Chu Feng was desperate to save Duan Liufeng, so as soon as he passed through the formation, he immediately scanned the surroundings using Heaven’s Eye to find a way to scale the mountain.

“Eyeyey, why are you still tagging along? Have some tact, alright? Those two lovebirds have just gotten betrothed to one another and are currently in their honeymoon period! Stop messing around and get lost!”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple suddenly berated Zuoqiu Youyu.

“Chu Feng and Zi Ling, I think we should move separately. The two of you will go as a group while I’ll travel together with this trash,” he turned to Chu Feng and said.

The trash he was referring to was naturally Zuoqiu Youyu.

Zuoqiu Youyu used to be the strongest disciple in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but he didn’t dare to act up despite being put down like that. It was not that he wasn’t angry but that he dared not to blow his top against the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.

“Alright.”

Chu Feng clasped his fist in response. While the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said that he had a score to settle with him, the actions he made had been advantageous to him all this while. This made Chu Feng at a loss as to whether the other party was a friend or foe.

In any case, it was good that they didn’t have to travel together with Zuoqiu Youyu. Otherwise, it would surely pose a great deal of trouble.

So, Chu Feng proceeded ahead with just Zi Ling. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After Chu Feng left, Zuoqiu Youyu’s expression swiftly tensed up. He felt extremely unnerved having to travel with the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.
