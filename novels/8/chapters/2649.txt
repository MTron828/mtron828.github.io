Chapter 2649 - Inescapable Predestined Fate

“Really!”

“Senior... what is he doing?!”

After her astonishment passed, Chu Yue grew furious.

As she spoke, she moved to exit the umbrella. She was planning to reveal herself.

She wanted to openly question Chu Bore as to why he was doing this sort of thing.

She wanted to know why he had gone against the rules established by their Chu Heavenly Clan.

She wanted to know why he wanted to slaughter everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

After all, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory. The people living there could be considered to be the Chu Heavenly Clan’s citizens.

“Chu Yue, have you gone insane?!” Right at that moment, Chu Huai grabbed Chu Yue. He prevented her from walking out of the umbrella that was concealing them.

“Release me! I need to go and ask exactly why senior is doing this!” Chu Yue shouted.

Her voice was truly loud and clear. It was even more ear-piercing than thunder. If it wasn’t for the umbrella, it was likely everyone present would’ve heard her voice.

Fortunately, they were under the umbrella. It had contained her shout so that only Chu Huai could hear it.

“Do you want to die going out there at a time like this?!” Chu Huai lashed out at Chu Yue.

Hearing those words, Chu Yue revealed a stunned expression. Her aggressiveness to leave immediately calmed down.

Cautiously, she asked, “That’s senior out there. Are you saying that he will... kill me?”

“Look at the current Chu Bore. Is he the same Chu Bore that we knew? Is he still the senior that we knew?” Chu Huai asked.

Chu Yue looked to Chu Bore again. It was only at that moment that she discovered that Chu Bore had a sinister, gloomy and cold expression on his face. Compared to the genial Chu Bore that they knew, he was indeed a completely different person.

“One might know a person for a long time without knowing their true nature. The reason why he dared to reveal himself at such a time is precisely to unleash a massacre. As long as he kills everyone here, no one will know what he’s done.”

“If the two of us are to reveal ourselves at such a time, do you think he will spare us?” Chu Huai asked.

“But why is he doing such a thing? Is there something even more important than our lives? Something that he will kill us to accomplish?” Chu Yue asked.

“There is,” Chu Huai looked to Chu Bore. Then, he said, “His own life is more important than our lives.”

Hearing those words, Chu Yue’s expression changed. She seemed to be unable to find a way to refute Chu Huai.

Then, Chu Yue quietly pulled back the foot that she stepped forward with.

She also did not dare to take the risk of exiting the umbrella. She was also scared, scared that Chu Bore would really kill them should he find out that they were there.

She was scared that he would silence them!!!

“Never would I expect for someone of the Chu Heavenly Clan to be the one to do this sort of thing,” Chu Feng said after sizing up Chu Bore.

The reason Chu Feng said that was because Chu Bore still had the Chu Heavenly Clan’s title plate on his waist.

Actually, Chu Feng was very surprised too. He never imagined that someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan would do this sort of thing.

“Chu Heavenly Clan?”

Once Chu Feng mentioned it, Ying Mingchao and the others also noticed the title plate on Chu Bore’s waist.

After verifying the identity of the old man, the people present started to panic even more. What was the Chu Heavenly Clan? They were not only the masters of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, but they also ruled over the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

While they could disregard the people of the younger generation that the Chu Heavenly Clan sent to train, as those people would not receive protection from the Chu Heavenly Clan while training there, the true experts of the Chu Heavenly Clan were existences capable of obliterating them instantly. They were beings that the people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm did not dare to disrespect.

As for the old man before them, he was evidently one such being.

Before people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, those people simply could not be described as martial cultivators.

That old man possessed the power to rule over the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Before them, he was akin to a god, and possessed the power to control everything.

To go against a god, how could they possibly win?

“Chu Feng, exactly what is your origin? You’ve actually trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?” Chu Bore asked Chu Feng.

“That is none of your concern,” Chu Feng said coldly.

“Heh...” Chu Bore laughed indifferently. Then, the corners of his mouth lifted into a cold and sinister smile. He said, “Actually, it doesn’t matter whether or not you tell me. After all, you will not be able to escape death today. Furthermore, no one will know that it was me that killed you.”

“Even if you have backing, there is nothing they can do.”

Although Chu Bore spoke with a very indifferent tone, he was actually worried that killing Chu Feng would offend the huge monster behind him.

While the Chu Heavenly Clan behind Chu Bore was a huge monster itself, it remained that Chu Feng was someone that trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. He felt that the power behind Chu Feng might not necessarily be weaker than the Chu Heavenly Clan.

With the abilities that Chu Feng had grasped and how talented he was, he would most definitely be considered a heavenly genius even in his power.

Chu Bore actually did not dare to offend a heavenly genius like Chu Feng. The reason for that was because if the power behind Chu Feng were to know that he had killed Chu Feng, then, with the status that he possessed, the Chu Heavenly Clan would definitely not protect him. For the sake of appeasing the power behind Chu Feng, they would send him to them to handle.

This was the greatest fear that Chu Bore possessed. However, he had no idea that Chu Feng actually did not have a huge monster behind him.

The person that he thought to be a heavenly genius was merely the Chu Heavenly Clan’s discarded trash child.

“You’re planning to kill us to silence us?”

“In that case, it would mean that this matter is not being conducted under orders from the Chu Heavenly Clan, but rather something that you decided on your own?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’ve guessed correctly,” Chu Bore said with a light chuckle.

“Milord, please spare us, please spare us!”

Right at that moment, voices begging for forgiveness sounded from the crowd below. More and more people began to beg for forgiveness.

Looking down, those people were all kneeling on the ground and kowtowing to Chu Bore nonstop.

Chu Bore took a glance at them. There was no trace of pity in his eyes. He said, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill you all immediately.”

After he finished saying those words, he looked to Chu Feng again, “Didn’t you want to know what it is that I’m trying to unseal with my formation?”

“Rest assured, before you die here, I will satisfy your curiosity and broaden everyone’s horizons.”

“This might be something that you all would not be able to witness in your entire lives otherwise.”

“Buzz~~~”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Bore began to form hand seals with one hand. The next moment, dark black gaseous flames began to emerge from his body, and started to assimilate into the grand formation. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The dark black gaseous flames that he emitted were different from those of the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. They did not possess the miserable infant crying sounds, and did not seem that frightening and sinister. Naturally, they were not that sinister.

However, people like Chu Feng were able to clearly sense that the dark black gaseous flames emitted by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s old man before them was not something that the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster could compare to. In fact, the dark black gaseous flames emitted by everyone from the Infant Soul Sect combined was greatly inferior to those this old man was currently emitting.

This was true frightening power.

“Rumble~~~~”

Rumbles began to sound from the grand formation. They were deafening.

Chu Feng and the others raised their heads and looked toward the sky and unease filled their eyes.

The reason for that was because the Infant Soul Grand Formation was no longer completely black. Rays of blue light began to appear in that dark black grand formation. Those should be the extracted souls from the Hundred Refinement Ordinary Realm’s hundreds of millions of lives.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, the blue lights started to gather together. They started to mix with the dark black gaseous flames, forming a gaseous pillar of flames that shot straight into the depths of the earth.

“Buzz~~~”

The next moment, golden lines began to appear on the surface of the earth. Those lines started to interweave with one another and continued to spread, like a vast sea of boundless golden lines.

At the very least, from where Chu Feng could see, the surface below was completely covered with golden lines.

It was a grand formation so enormous that even Chu Feng started feeling fearful.

“That’s a sealing formation?”

Soon, Chu Feng determined that the formation that had appeared on the surface of the earth was a sealing formation. It was an extremely vast sealing formation.

Merely, what could such a vast sealing formation be sealing?

“Chu Feng, this feeling, this is bad,” even Her Lady Queen revealed an expression of unease.

Such an enormous sealing formation could only mean one thing: it was sealing something extremely grand.

“Eggy, you’ve also noticed it?” Chu Feng asked.

“What?” Her Lady Queen was confused. Evidently... she did not notice what Chu Feng had noticed.

“Seems like you didn’t notice it. That’s understandable, you can only see what I see and hear what I hear, but not completely sense what I am sensing,” Chu Feng said.

“Exactly what did you manage to sense?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“I sensed that old cat’s aura from the grand sealing formation below,” Chu Feng said.

“Old cat, you’re talking about that Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s old cat?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“Yes, that cat is precisely what I’m talking about,” Chu Feng said.

“Then, wouldn’t it mean that this grand formation is...?” Her Lady Queen grew even more astonished.

“There’s no mistake. What this Chu Heavenly Clansman is trying to unseal is the thing sealed by that old cat,” Chu Feng said.

“This is truly bad,” Her Lady Queen revealed an even more astonished and uneasy expression.

She still remembered how Grandmaster Pocket described the item sealed by that old cat.

‘That item was not something from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. It was from the Outer World, and possessed an extremely bloodthirsty and cruel nature.’

‘If that item were to break free from its seal, the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would fall into a calamity, and everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would be killed.’

‘It would be an inescapable fate for the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.’
