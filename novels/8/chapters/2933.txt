Chapter 2933 - A Kind Warning

“Heavens, an Immortal Armament of that quality is simply too rare. There’s actually such a treasure inside the Illusionary Blood Lotus?”

“Damn it, it’s only those from the younger generation that can approach it again. Such a treasure is right before my eyes, yet I’m unable to seize it. Damn it! This is truly frustrating!”

The great majority of people did not notice how dangerous the red fog around the Illusory Blood Lotus had become. They were completely captivated by that absolute gem of an Immortal Armament.

While the crowd were feeling very excited, they were also openly complaining.

After all, that peerless treasure was something that they could only see, and not fight for. No one would feel pleased in that sort of situation.

That said, the ones feeling displeased were not only those from the older generation. A great majority of the people from the younger generation were also feeling displeased.

After all, one must possess sufficient strength to enter that crimson fog. Those without sufficient strength would simply be throwing away their lives should they forcibly enter the crimson fog.

The people that were lying on the ground served as the best example of that.

Furthermore, there were so many geniuses from the younger generation present. Even if they were to take turns, it would never reach their turn. After all, those were all demon-level geniuses.

Thus, the only people that were powerful enough to enter the crimson fog and fight for that peerless Immortal Armament would be those few people... Chu Ruoshi, Song Yunfei, Chu Huanyu, Ren Xiaoyao, Chu Lingxi, Xia Yun’er and Chu Feng.

Naturally, those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations also possessed the strength to enter the crimson fog.

At that moment, Chu Ruoshi and the others were all very eager to enter the crimson fog. They had all made their preparations.

As long as someone decided to enter the crimson fog, all of them would rush toward the crimson fog like loosed arrows.

The reason for that was because this was not only a fight over treasure, but it was also a great opportunity to prove themselves.

This was especially true for Chu Ruoshi, Song Yunfei and Chu Huanyu. They wanted to prove to the crowd that while there were a lot of people from the younger generation present, only one among them was the strongest.

Because of this, Xia Yun’er was also unable to wait patiently, and was planning to rush in first.

She wanted to seize the decisive opportunity. After all, her strength was inferior to theirs. Only by seizing the opportunity, by acting first, would she have a chance to break through the illusion formation first and obtain that peerless Immortal Armament.

Right at the moment when Xia Yun’er was planning to act, Chu Feng suddenly said to her, “Do not go in.”

“Ah?” When she heard those words, Xia Yun’er stopped her extended lily white feet. However, surprise filled her beautiful eyes. She was unable to understand why Chu Feng was telling her to not go in.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze toward Chu Ruoshi and the others. He said loudly, “Miss Ruoshi, Miss Lingxi, I urge you all to not approach that crimson fog.”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the people of the younger generation that were all eager to enter the crimson fog all turned their eyes to Chu Feng. Their expressions were the same as Xia Yun’er; they were completely confused.

“Young master Chu Feng, what’s wrong?” Chu Ruoshi asked.

“That crimson fog is extremely dangerous,” Chu Feng said.

“No shit!” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, especially the males, immediately revealed displeased expressions.

“And here I was wondering what you were going to say. Turns out, that’s all you wanted to say? Is there even a need for you to remind us that it’s dangerous? Anyone with eyes can tell it’s dangerous!”

“Motherfucker, aren’t you just spouting rubbish here? Who doesn’t know that the crimson fog emitted by the Illusory Blood Lotus is extremely dangerous? Was there a need for you to remind us of that?”

At that moment, those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations all began to lash out at Chu Feng. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

They were able to tell that Chu Huanyu was extremely against Chu Feng. As they were Chu Huanyu’s lackeys, they would naturally seize this opportunity to insult Chu Feng.

Chu Feng remained unaffected by their mockery. He continued to look to Chu Ruoshi and Chu Lingxi. He said, “Miss Ruoshi, Miss Lingxi, that crimson fog is truly not as simple as you all imagine it to be. That said, I’m only warning you all. Whether or not you take my warning to heart will all be up to you.”

“Chu Feng, if you don’t dare to enter, you can continue to stand here and do nothing. Why must you go out of your way to stop us from entering?”

“That’s right. So after all this, you’re not only a coward, but you’re also a lowly vile man.”

“Just because you yourself do not dare to enter the crimson fog, you’ve decided to attempt to pull us away from entering it too. You are simply too shameless.”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations continued to make cutting remarks about Chu Feng. They simply did not believe him. They truly felt that Chu Feng was saying those things because he did not dare to go in, and was trying to have them suffer the same fate as him.

“Do not speak rudely!” Right at that moment, Chu Ruoshi turned around and shouted lightly at them.

Her shout was very quiet. However, it an contained enormous deterring force.

Once she said those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations immediately shut their mouths.

It could be seen that they were not only afraid of Chu Huanyu, but they seemed to be even more afraid of Chu Ruoshi.

“Young Master Chu Feng, did you discover something?” Chu Ruoshi turned to ask Chu Feng.

“No, I didn’t discover anything. It is purely my intuition,” Chu Feng said.

“Clamor~~~”

Once Chu Feng said those words, even without the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations saying anything, the surrounding crowd began to spiritedly discuss the matter.

He was advising others to not enter the crimson fog merely because of his intuition? This was simply a bit too far-fetched.

“Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, I feel that the brothers from the Chu Heavenly Clan have spoken very correctly. You are not only a coward, but you’re also a lowly vile man. Just because you yourself do not dare to enter, you also do not want us to enter.”

“However, I, Song Yunfei, will not fall for your evil schemes.”

After Song Yunfei finished saying those words, he leaped up and entered the crimson fog.

At practically the same moment that Song Yunfei leaped forth, Ren Xiaoyao and the others also leaped into the crimson fog.

Upon entering the crimson fog, they only flew for a short distance before their bodies went motionless. Furthermore, their eyes were closed. It was as if they had fallen asleep.

That said, the distance that they’d each traveled was different.

Song Yunfei was the closest to the Illusory Blood Lotus. Following him was Ren Xiaoyao.

It would appear that the difference in strength determined the distance which they could reach in the crimson fog.

Right at that moment, Chu Huanyu said to Chu Ruoshi, “Chu Ruoshi, that Chu Feng is a coward. Could it be that you’re a coward too?” As he said those words, there was a mocking sneer on his face.

It could be seen that Chu Huanyu, compared to the other Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, was not afraid of Chu Ruoshi.

After he finished saying those words, Chu Huanyu also leapt into the crimson fog. The distance he managed to travel was, although inferior to Song Yunfei, further than Ren Xiaoyao.

“Young Master Chu Feng, thank you for your warning. However... I still plan to give it a try.”

Chu Ruoshi smiled lightly at Chu Feng. Then, her delicate body leaped forward, and she too entered the crimson fog.

Chu Ruoshi’s strength was truly not to be looked down upon. After entering the crimson fog, she actually managed to surpass Song Yunfei.

Although she only surpassed him by a meter, it was sufficient to show how powerful Chu Ruoshi was.

After all, both she and Song Yunfei possessed the same level of cultivation.

At that moment, Chu Feng looked to Chu Lingxi. he discovered thatChu Lingxi was truly a strange and unfathomable person.

When Chu Feng was urging them not to enter the crimson fog, Chu Lingxi did not say anything. However, she actually did not enter the crimson fog now.

Most importantly, Chu Lingxi was clearly also extremely eager before, and planning to enter the crimson fog before Chu Feng warned them.

In other words, while even Chu Ruoshi refused to listen to Chu Feng’s warning, Chu Lingxi actually listened.

Of course, it was not only Chu Lingxi that listened to Chu Feng’s warning. Xia Yun’er also listened.

Compared to the other people of the younger generation, Xia Yun’er knew how powerful Chu Feng was better than anybody else.

Thus, even though Chu Feng did not possess any evidence for the danger that he spoke of, she was still willing to believe in him.

“There were actually really people that believed in Chu Feng.”

“What a pity. Because of what Chu Feng said, we are unable to witness the strength of the two beautiful geniuses Chu Lingxi and Xia Yun’er. This is truly regretful.”

“What’s with this Chu Feng? Just because he doesn’t dare to enter it himself, why must he allow others to not enter it too? I have truly misjudged him.”

Seeing that Chu Feng, Xia Yun’er and Chu Lingxi, those three demon-level geniuses, were all not entering the crimson fog, a small portion of the crowd started to complain.

They were all people without a mind of their own. They did not know Chu Feng very well, and had only heard rumors about him. However, they had been skeptical of those rumors the entire time.

And after Chu Feng declared the crimson fog to be extremely dangerous with no proof, and told Chu Ruoshi and the others to not enter it, those people started feeling that what the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations and Song Yunfei said was very correct.

They were truly feeling that Chu Feng was a coward who not only did not dare to enter the crimson fog himself, but was also trying to prevent others from entering it too.

“Wuuu~~~”

Right at that moment, a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation in the crimson fog suddenly revealed an expression of pain.

Following that, the great majority of the people inside the crimson fog began to show expressions of pain.

“This?!!!”

Seeing this, the surrounding crowd were finally unable to remain calm anymore.

At that moment, apart from Chu Ruoshi, Song Yunfei, Chu Huanyu and Ren Xiaoyao, all of the other people of the younger generation that had entered the crimson fog had expressions of pain on their faces. They seemed to be enduring some sort of painful torture.

One must know that those inside the crimson fog with painful expressions were all extraordinary people of the younger generation.

While they could not be considered demon-level geniuses, they were all capable of being considered geniuses in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm!!!
