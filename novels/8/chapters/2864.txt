Chapter 2864 - Its Name Is The Inheritance Cave

“Good, very good. As the saying goes, those who walk different paths cannot make plans together.”

“As the Ghost Sect Hall and myself possess different opinions, it will be difficult for us to be friends in the future.”

At that moment, Song Yunfei had a furious expression on his face. Regardless of how composed he might be, he was unable to tolerate it.

Evidently, the decision made by Old Man Gui Chou had truly upset Song Yunfei.

“Little friend Song Yunfei, your opinion is your own concern. That is not something that our Ghost Sect Hall can decide for you,” Old Man Gui Chou said with a smile.

It would appear that Old Man Gui Chou had anticipated Song Yunfei’s reaction. Thus, he was not affected in the slightest.

“Very well. You will all regret this one day,” Song Yunfei said while pointing at Old Man Gui Chou.

His words contained hidden implications once again.

He was telling Old Man Gui Chou that the Ghost Sect Hall would regret their decision to befriend Chu Feng and break off relations with him.

He was stating that he, Song Yunfei, would definitely continue to surpass Chu Feng.

“I never regret my decisions,” Old Man Gui Chou smiled once again.

“Humph,” faced with the determined attitude from Old Man Gui Chou, Song Yunfei’s complexion turned even greener. Even his body started to shiver with rage.

Under this sort of situation, he had no heart to continue with superfluous words anymore. He waved his sleeve and prepared to leave.

However, before leaving, he took a fierce glance at Chu Feng, His eyes were filled with threatening intent.

It was as if he were telling Chu Feng that he would take care of him one day.

However, faced with Song Yunfei’s threatening gaze, Chu Feng merely smiled. He said, “What happened today must’ve truly disappointed brother Song.”

“Me, disappointed? What are you trying to say?” Song Yunfei asked in a very displeased manner.

“There’s no need for me to say it clearly. I believe you know what I’m implying,” Chu Feng said.

Understand? Song Yunfei naturally understood very well.

Han Yu was invited over to take care of Chu Feng by him. Yet, he ended up being defeated by Chu Feng.

He wanted to use his status to force the Ghost Sect Hall to distance themselves from Chu Feng, and he obtained a determined attitude from the Ghost Sect Hall’s Old Man Gui Chou.

Merely, their determined attitude was toward choosing Chu Feng, and not him.

Today, Song Yunfei could be said to have been utterly humiliated. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“The future is long, we shall wait and see.”

After Song Yunfei finished saying those words, he turned around and left.

Seeing this scene, not to mention those geniuses from the younger generation, many of the people from the surrounding crowd were also able to tell that Song Yunfei greatly detested Chu Feng. He was planning to make an enemy of Chu Feng.

At that moment, there were people that inevitably started to worry for Chu Feng.

Song Yunfei was someone who possessed great influence in the Starfall Holy Land. He was the future successor of the Starfall Holy Land.

Perhaps it might not be something serious for Chu Feng to have offended Swordking City. However, was Chu Feng really capable of offending the Starfall Holy Land?

After all, the Starfall Holy Land was the most powerful colossus in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm apart from the ruler of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Right after Song Yunfei left, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter started to gradually walk in midair. She arrived before Chu Feng and spoke with a very gentle tone, “Young master Chu Feng, there is one thing that I wish to seek your assistance with.”

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“It is unsuitable for me to mention it here, might it be possible for us to discuss it elsewhere?” Xia Yun’er said.

Chu Feng pondered deeply. In the end, he accepted her request.

After that, Elder Xingyi waved his sleeve, and a layer of power covered Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er.

The next moment, Elder Xingyi, Chu Feng and Xia Yun’er simultaneously disappeared..

Seeing this scene, Song Yunfei’s expression grew even uglier.

He had completely revealed his intention to make an enemy of Chu Feng. Yet, Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi were still acting like this. This was truly embarrassing for him.

At that moment, the surrounding crowd seemed to realize why Song Yunfei would detest Chu Feng like that.

It turned out that Elder Xingyi was protecting Chu Feng because of Xia Yun’er.

As for Song Yunfei, the Holy Son of the Starfall Holy Land, he was jealous because the Holy Daughter Xia Yun’er was so close to Chu Feng. His jealousy was normal.

However, for Song Yunfei to make things difficult for Chu Feng merely out of jealousy, this inevitably caused the crowd to feel somewhat disappointed in Song Yunfei.

Of course, this was merely the guess of those that did not know the truth. As for what was really the case, they had no idea at all.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng felt his surroundings turning fuzzy. When his vision became clear again, he discovered that he had already left the Void Sacred Tree and the crowd. He was currently located on a warship.

That warship was flying above white clouds. Its speed was very fast.

Naturally, Chu Feng was not the only person on the warship. Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi were also present.

“Miss Xia, you said that you need my assistance with something. What might it be?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s like this: when our Starfall Holy Land’s previous Holy Ruler was traveling through the Nine Profound Upper Realm, he got to know an Utmost Exalted Elder of the Nine Profound Sect, the Nine Profound Upper Realm’s overlord power.”

[1. Bee used ‘headmaster’ here. However, he used ‘Holy Ruler’ in ch 2835. Keeping it as Holy Ruler.]

“The two of them hit it off right away and became close friends.”

“After that, that Nine Profound Sect’s Utmost Exalted Elder would frequently visit the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm to train and study the path of martial cultivation with our Holy Ruler.”

“Occasionally, they would wander through the world to search for mysterious places in many remnants. The two of them also managed to find a mysterious place in our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Flat Mount Ravine,” Xia Yun’er explained.

However, when Chu Feng heard the name Flat Mount Ravine, his heart was immediately moved.

When Chu Feng was in the Everchanging Mystery Realm, he had obtained a map. That map had recorded the location of Exalted Archer’s tomb.

To put it simply, that was the location where Exalted Archer was buried. The place where Exalted Archer was buried was precisely called Flat Mount Ravine.

Even though waves had emerged in his heart, Chu Feng still kept the same sort of undisturbed expression.

He did not say anything. He was continuing to listen to Xia Yun’er.

“The mysterious place that they discovered in Flat Mount Ravine was a bit special. Although it couldn’t be said to be miraculous, it was still a rare treasure deposit. Back then, our Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Ruler and that Nine Profound Sect’s Utmost Exalted Elder both benefited greatly from that mysterious place.”

“However, there is one place in the Flat Mount Ravine that not even the two of them were able to enter.”

“As for that place, it is the place where the two of them wanted to enter the most. Its name was the Inheritance Cave,” Xia Yun’er said.
