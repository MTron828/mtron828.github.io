Chapter 3930 - Their Past

Chu Feng had disappeared all of a sudden earlier because he had gone to treat the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster.

Although the poison the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster had been given might be beyond rescue for the disciples of the Whiteclothes Nunnery, it was an easy task for Chu Feng.

In no time at all, Chu Feng had removed the poison from the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster.

Although she still needed time to recover, there was no danger to her life.

When the Whiteclothes Nunnery disciples discovered that their Lady Headmaster was safe, they were naturally all extremely grateful to Chu Feng.

For Chu Feng, treating their headmaster was simply an effortless task. He did not seek their gratefulness. Instead, he was curious as to why Linghu Yueyue would be reduced to residing in such a place.

Exactly what had happened to her?

That said, Chu Feng felt that it would not be suitable to ask her directly. Even if he asked her, she might not necessarily tell him.

Thus, Chu Feng decided to ask the girl by the name of An’an.

Chu Feng had helped them enormously. Not only had he saved the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster, but he had also indirectly saved Linghu Yueyue and that An’an.

Because of that, An’an was very grateful to Chu Feng. She was also extremely cordial to him when he decided to speak with her in private.

After chatting for a bit, Chu Feng learned that An’an’s full name was Linghu An’an.

Sure enough, she was also a Linghu Heavenly Clansman.

If Chu Feng guessed correctly, she should be Linghu Yueyue’s servant girl, or a sister with a close relationship to Linghu Yueyue. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Otherwise, she would not address her as young miss.

Furthermore, she was not only respectful to Linghu Yueyue, but she also emitted the sort of feeling one had toward one’s friend. All of this made Chu Feng realized that they had a deep relationship akin to that of sisters.

“An’an, even though you and your young miss’s cultivations were crippled, there’s still a chance to restore them,” Chu Feng said all of a sudden.

“Milord, is what you said the truth?!”

Sure enough, An’an’s expression changed brilliantly upon hearing Chu Feng’s words.

She was astonished, and felt disbelief. At the same time, her eyes burned with desire and hope.

Her reaction was understandable. She was, after all, a cultivator. Regardless of what one’s cultivation might be, it was still something that one trained painstakingly to obtain.

To cultivators, cultivation might be one of the most precious things for them. No one was willing to lose their cultivation.

“Your Dantian is not only there to preserve martial power and cultivation. One’s dantian is also training. As long as your cultivation has reached a certain level in the past, your dantian would have also reached that level.”

“While it is true that the destruction of one’s dantian and the dispersal of one’s martial power will cause one’s cultivation to flow out, the level which one’s dantian has reached will not decrease.”

“I’ve observed you two. Although your dantians are shattered, the state of injury is not very serious. As long as you two follow the method I teach you to train in after your dantians are restored, you will soon regain your cultivation. It will not be hard to recover the cultivation you had in the past.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng suddenly looked to Linghu An’an, who stood up all of a sudden.

Linghu An’an was extremely excited, so much so that her body was shivering uncontrollably.

Suddenly, Linghu An’an bent her knees. She was planning to kneel to Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng already realized that she would do that. Thus, he held her up before she could get on her knees.

“If you are to kneel, I will not help you,” he said with a smile.

“Milord, are you really willing to help myself and my young miss regain our cultivations?”

Linghu An’an was extremely anxious. She was extremely afraid that Chu Feng would refuse to help her. She was so anxious that tears were flowing from her eyes.

She had already realized that Chu Feng told her those things because he wanted to help them.

Yet, she was still extremely afraid, afraid that he would not help them.

Her appearance was truly quite heart-wrenching.

“I am able to help you. However, my master once gave me a set of rules.”

“Before helping someone recover their cultivation, I must first know how and why their cultivation was crippled. Thus, are you willing to tell me the truth as to what happened? If you’re willing, I will naturally be able to help,” said Chu Feng.

“I’m willing, I’m willing.”

“Merely, Milord, I have a condition,” Linghu An’an revealed a difficult look as she said those words.

“Speak away. Don’t bother to hold back anything that might be difficult.”

Chu Feng did not wish to put pressure on Linghu An’an. In fact, he was already able to guess what she was worried about.

“While I am able to tell Milord what happened to myself and my young miss, I earnestly request that Milord does not tell my young miss that I’ve told you everything. My young miss does not wish for what happened to us to be known to outsiders. Even though the Whiteclothes Nunnery’s headmaster saved us, young miss still did not tell her what happened to us.”

Sure enough, it was exactly as Chu Feng had expected. It wasn’t that Linghu An’an was unwilling to tell him. Instead, it was Linghu Yueyue who was unwilling to tell anyone.

“I accept your condition. I will keep this matter confidential. I will not have your young miss find out about it,” said Chu Feng.

“Milord, thank you for your understanding.”

Linghu An’an felt extremely grateful. Then, she began to tell Chu Feng what had happened.

She even told him about the clan they belonged to, the starfield they were from, and even the matter about the conflict between their Linghu Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan.

After Linghu Zhishi left the Ancestral Martial Starfield with a portion of the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s elites, he decided to seek asylum under the All-heaven Sect.

The All-heaven Sect agreed to shelter them and help them get revenge. From that point onward, the Linghu Heavenly Clan became the All-heaven Sect’s lackey.

The things the All-heaven Sect had the Linghu Heavenly Clan do were mostly filthy and cruel. They were shameless things that could not be revealed to the public.

For the sake of revenge, Linghu Zhishi was able to disregard the lives of his own clansmen. As for killing innocent people, it was simply a non-issue.

However, Linghu Yueyue, as the daughter of Linghu Zhishi and the princess of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, strongly opposed her father’s savagery.

In the end, the father and daughter got into a major argument.

During that argument, Linghu Yueyue proclaimed that she would leave the Linghu Heavenly Clan; leave her father.

Linghu Zhishi stated that if Linghu Yueyue insisted on leaving the Linghu Heavenly Clan, she was free to do so. However, she would no longer be his daughter and that he would retrieve everything he’d given her.

Thus, not only did he take away all the precious treasures Linghu Yueyue possessed, but he even took away her cultivation.

Even though Chu Feng had already guessed that Linghu Yueyue’s crippled cultivation was most likely related to the Linghu Heavenly Clan, he had never imagined the person who crippled her cultivation to be her own father, Linghu Zhishi!
