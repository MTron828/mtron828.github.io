Chapter 3619 - The World’s Finest Gathering

“You should introduce them to me,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Brother Chu Feng, you are truly someone. You actually don’t even know the two of them.”

“Forget about it, forget about it. I’ll introduce them to you.”

“Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo are the strongest geniuses of the Starfield Master Realm. The two of them are not inferior to Linghu Hongfei.”

“Merely, they keep a rather low profile. No, it’s not a low profile. Rather, they are excessively arrogant and proud, so much that they rarely show themselves to the public.”

“It’s precisely because of that that their reputation is not as vast as Linghu Hongfei’s. However, they are still very renowned in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“After all, the two of them are the strongest geniuses of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Actually, it’s not only the two of them. That younger sister of mine, Kong Ci, Monstrous Holy City’s little sister Xian Yun and Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s little sister Long Ning, the three of them also possess strength not inferior to Linghu Hongfei.”

“It’s just that they have no interest in participating in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars. Otherwise, the first ranked spot would not necessarily have been occupied by Linghu Hongfei for so many years,” said Kong Tianhui. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“In that case, wouldn’t it mean that apart from Linghu Hongfei, all of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s strongest younger generations will be present at this gathering?” Chu Feng asked.

“I guess you can say that. That said, brother Chu Feng, you should keep yourself hidden when we arrive. I will brag about you. When I need you to appear, you will then appear.”

“The two of us don’t have to fight on the spot. You merely need to admit that you were defeated by me. Is that okay with you, brother Chu Feng?”

After he finished saying those words, Kong Tianhui’s eyes were shining like the bright starry sky.

It was as if he would immediately cry should Chu Feng refuse to agree to it.

“Sure, sure, sure. I promise, okay? Now, stop looking at me with that disgusting gaze,” Chu Feng spoke with contempt.

“Haha. Good, good, good. As long as you promise me, I will listen to anything you say. Brother Chu Feng, you are truly a good man.”

“Haha. I’m going to utterly humiliate Kong Feiyang now,” Kong Tianhui became particularly happy.

“I’m helping you with this to deceive others. This means that you have an unfair advantage. Thus, you should restrain yourself, and not be too excessive,” said Chu Feng.

“Okay. We’ll do as you say,” Kong Tianhui said with a grin.

After traveling for a while longer, Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui finally arrived at that mysterious Divine Armament Villa.

Although it was called a villa, it encompassed such a vast area that it would not be excessive to call it a nation.

There were mountains, rivers and streams. As for palaces, their numbers were simply too many to count.

Although the Divine Armament Villa was so enormous, it was actually private land. Apart from the people from the Three Cities and the Starfield Master Realm, no one else was allowed to enter.

Furthermore, although the Divine Armament Villa seemed to be unguarded, it was actually guarded by a peak Exalted-level expert. For outsiders, not to mention intruding into the villa, just approaching it would provoke a calamity.

However, with Kong Tianhui with him, Chu Feng easily entered the Divine Armament Villa.

After entering the Divine Armament Villa, Kong Tianhui acted very familiar with the place, and proceeded toward a garden in the villa.

Chu Feng followed Kong Tianhui to the garden. However, he did not show himself. Instead, he hid himself using a concealment formation.

Thus, Chu Feng was right behind Kong Tianhui. Naturally, he was able to see the situation within the garden.

Many geniuses from the Three Cities were gathered in the garden. From their different outfits and the title plates on their waists, Chu Feng was able to distinguish their identities.

However, Chu Feng felt that Kong Tianhui’s so-called ‘Flowers of the Three Cities,’ Kong Ci, Xian Yun and Long Ning, were not present amongst those people.

The geniuses from the Starfall Master Realm were also not present.

Likely, they had yet to arrive.

However, seeing Kong Tianhui’s excited appearance as he rushed into the garden, Chu Feng knew that his arch-enemy Kong Feiyang was definitely amongst the crowd.

“Oh my, isn’t this Kong Tianhui?”

“And here I was thinking that you wouldn’t dare to show up anymore.”

Upon seeing Kong Tianhui, a thin, tall man cast a mocking gaze at him.

Once he spoke, the surrounding people immediately started laughing.

“Oh my, isn’t this Kong Feiyang?”

“I dare ask, why would I, Kong Tianhui, not dare to show up?” asked Kong Tianhui.

Sure enough, that man who immediately ridiculed Kong Tianhui upon seeing him was his arch-rival, Kong Feiyang.

“Didn’t you go to challenge Chu Feng?”

“According to the timing of things, you should’ve returned to the Royal City a while ago, and journeyed to the Divine Armament Villa with us. However, you didn’t appear. Isn’t it obvious that you didn’t show up because you failed in your challenge, and didn’t dare to show your face?” Kong Tianhui spoke mockingly.

The surrounding people all nodded in approval at Kong Feiyang’s words.

“Failed my challenge? Who told you that I definitely failed?” Kong Tianhui asked.

“With your bits of abilities, you think you’re able to defeat that Chu Feng?” mocked Kong Feiyang.

“What if I won?”

“If I won, will you honor your promise?” asked Kong Tianhui.

“Of course. I, Kong Feiyang, always keep my word," said Kong Feiyang.

“I am truly sorry, but I won,” Kong Tianhui said.

“Hahaha...”

Upon hearing those words, Kong Feiyang burst into laughter. His laughter was truly wild and filled with mockery.

He laughed for a long while before saying to Kong Tianhui, “Kong Tianhui, why must you be like this? Have you, for the sake of reputation, decided to throw away your face?”

“Kong Feiyang, why do you think that I am incapable of defeating Chu Feng?” asked Kong Tianhui.

“I, Kong Feiyang, am capable of determining that you’re incapable of defeating Chu Feng. That’s why I dared to bet with you.”

Kong Feiyang pointed at Kong Tianhui’s face with his finger. His attitude was very arrogant, strong and forceful.

“Since we’re brothers, it’s unsuitable for me to have you truly kill yourself. How about this: if I can prove that I defeated Chu Feng, you don’t have to kill yourself. You merely need to publicly apologize to me and greet me respectfully like an elder whenever you see me from this point on. Do you dare to accept that?” said Kong Tianhui.

“Why wouldn’t I dare? However, if you cannot prove that you’ve defeated Chu Feng, I don’t need you to publicly apologize to me and greet me respectfully like an elder or anything of that sort,” said Kong Feiyangi.

“What do you want then?” asked Kong Tianhui.

“I want you to kneel before me and lick my foot. Do that, and I’ll spare you,” said Kong Feiyang.

“Very well.”

“Everyone, you have heard this Kong Feiyang make a new bet with me before you all,” Kong Tianhui said.

“I, Kong Feiyang, am one to keep my word. What about you, Kong Tianhui?” Kong Feiyang asked.

“I, Kong Tianhui, am naturally one to keep my word,” said Kong Tianhui.

“Very well. Go ahead and kneel then,” Kong Feiyang said. Then, he took off one shoe and extended his foot toward Kong Tianhui’s face.
