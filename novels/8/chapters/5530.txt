Chapter 5530: There’s a Way Out

“I need to confirm something.”

Chu Feng turned his sights on one of the light pillar formations not too far away. He rushed in and entered the formation core. Same as before, he completed the formation and allowed the Totem Dragon Clansmen to enter.

As soon as a single clansman stepped in, the avatars of everyone else in the Totem Dragon Clan immediately strengthened.

“It looks like we’ll have to conquer more formations,” Chu Feng said.

Since the light pillar formations could strengthen the avatars of Long Chengyu and the others, it only made sense for them to complete more of it.

“Chu Feng, what’s with that compass?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I obtained that compass when I entered the cavern. The hint that was given to me was that we’ll meet with danger here, and deciphering the compass will ensure our safety. I wasn’t able to fully decipher the secrets of the compass, but I did gather some information.

“This realm is likely to be a huge formation in itself, which means that it’ll have a formation core too. I’m guessing that your avatars’ strengthening is caused by the huge formation’s effects. However, I’ll only be able to decipher the location of the formation core during the next break time,” Chu Feng said.

“For the time being, should we complete more formations to enhance the prowess of our avatars?” Long Chengyu asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

The group thus began completing the formations one after another. As all of their avatars would be enhanced as long as a single clansman stepped into the formation core, they decided not to leave anyone behind to temper their bloodline power out of safety concerns. Instead, they chose to quickly complete the formation, strengthen their avatars, then move on to the next formation.

This strategy greatly increased their efficiency in completing the formations. It didn’t take long for them to conquer nearly all of the uncompleted formations.

Finally, all of the light pillar formations in the realm were completed.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Totem Phoenix Clan conquered four formations.

The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, due to the huge loss in their manpower, ended up slowing down their pace and only conquered seven formations.

The Totem Dragon Clan, on the surface, looked to have conquered not many formations, but in truth, the benefits from the red lightning formations went to them. All in all, they conquered 25 formations.

“Brother Chu Feng, this is all thanks to you! We wouldn’t have achieved such results if not for you!” Long Chengyu remarked as he watched the magnificent sight of the activated formations.

By then, the avatars enveloping them had already become very distinct.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng’s eyes were focused on the compass in his hand. He knew that the next break time was going to be the crucial one.

Boom!

Shortly after, the entire world began quaking intensely, as the silhouettes inside the formations began rampaging. At the same time, the avatars around the Totem Dragon Clansmen turned corporeal as if they were their armor.

Long Chengyu and the others were excited by that, thinking that they could put their avatars into use. However, Chu Feng wasn’t in the mood to bother about that. His eyes were focused on the inscriptions on the compass, which had started moving once more.

This time, the compass only moved for two hours before halting. Chu Feng immediately turned his sight toward the northeast direction of the world.

“Follow me,” Chu Feng said.

Long Chengyu and the others quickly followed him.

“Chu Feng, did you manage to decipher the compass?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I haven’t fully deciphered it yet, but I have found the formation core,” Chu Feng replied.

“That’s great!” Long Chengyu and the others were overjoyed to hear that.

Soon, Chu Feng arrived at their destination.

Long Chengyu and the others examined their surroundings in confusion. They were unable to find anything of note in the vicinity.

“Take your positions in accordance with my instructions.”

Chu Feng began issuing orders for the Totem Dragon Clansmen to stand in specific locations, and Long Chengyu and the others did as they were told to. When they were all in position, Chu Feng formed a series of hand seals and unleashed the red lightning aura inside him.

Astonishingly, Long Chengyu and the others’ armor converged together to form a complete formation, which vaguely shaped out a formation core beneath their feet.

“There really is a formation core here!” the Totem Dragon Clansmen exclaimed in excitement.

It was just the shape of the formation core, but their bloodlines pulsated in resonance with it as if it was summoning them. They instinctively understood that as long as they could find the formation core and enter it, their bloodline power could be enhanced by leaps and bounds.

However, Chu Feng soon retracted the red lightning aura, which resulted in the disappearance of the formation too. Naturally, the outline of the formation core also faded.

However, the Totem Dragon Clansmen’s excitement remained unabated. They believed that they were the victors here.

Long Chengyu walked up to Chu Feng with an irrepressible grin and said, “Brother Chu Feng, I don’t know how I should thank you. Where did you learn that formation from? Was it from the compass?”

“It was from the compass, but Brother Chengyu… things aren’t that simple.” Chu Feng’s grim expression was a sharp contrast to those of the excited crowd.

“What do you mean?” Long Chengyu immediately retracted his smile.

“We won’t be able to claim the initiative even though we found the formation core. There are limits on the formation core. It’ll fully surface once the break time is over, and the light will draw everyone’s attention. The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan and the Totem Phoenix Clan will sense what you felt earlier,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you worried that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen will come?” Long Chengyu asked.

“It’s not just a worry. They’ll surely come,” Chu Feng replied.

“Is it possible to conceal the formation?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I won’t be able to do it.” Chu Feng shook his head.

“What should we do?” Long Chengyu panicked.

The smiles on the Totem Dragon Clansmen’s faces also vanished. After all, Chu Feng had already tested Qi Weidao’s strength, and he was an adversary whom even Long Chengyu couldn’t deal with.

While their avatars were greatly strengthened by the light pillar formations thanks to Chu Feng’s help, they wouldn’t be able to get anything out of it if they couldn’t enter the formation core. The thought of losing this precious fortuitous encounter filled them with indignance.

Just as the crowd was feeling distressed, Chu Feng suddenly spoke up, “Don’t worry. There’s a solution.”
