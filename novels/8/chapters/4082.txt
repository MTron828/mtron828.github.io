Chapter 4082 - No Need To Search

Originally, the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Supreme Elder had wanted to kill Chu Feng to vent his anger for those people who had been seriously injured by Chu Feng.

But now, he suddenly realized that he was simply no match for him.

This member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation was much more powerful than he had imagined him to be!

“Do you know who we are?”

“We’re from the Constellation Immortal Isle.”

Seeing that he was no match for Chu Feng, that Supreme Elder immediately brought up the power behind him with the intention of scaring Chu Feng.

Chu Feng laughed coldly. “I know you’re from the Constellation Immortal Isle.”

“You... you audacious zealot! You dare to attack us knowing that we’re from the Constellation Immortal Isle?!” asked that Supreme Elder.

“Heh...” Chu Feng chuckled. “I am attacking you precisely because you’re from the Constellation Immortal Isle.”

“Woosh~~~”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he actually disappeared.

When he appeared again, he had arrived before that Supreme Elder. A fist shot forth and smashed into that Supreme Elder’s face.

He had wanted to dodge.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng was simply too fast. Because of that, he could only watch helplessly as Chu Feng’s fist came toward him.

“Bang~~~”

The fist struck, and the Supreme Elder was sent flying before landing ruthlessly on the ground.

When he landed on the ground, his face was completely distorted, and he was unable to move a single step.

But, Chu Feng was not willing to let him off. He followed him and arrived before him.

Chu Feng’s arms moved nonstop. His fists pounded into that Supreme Elder nonstop like a torrential storm.

One punch. Ten punches. A hundred punches. A thousand punches...

Each and every punch met flesh!

By the time Chu Feng stopped punching, that Supreme Elder had changed beyond recognition. All his muscles were snapped. All his bones were shattered. He was unable to feel anything. He simply appeared no different from a dead man.

In fact, it could be said that what was beneath Chu Feng was no longer a man, but rather a pile of blood.

The Constellation Immortal Isle’s Supreme Elder did not die. He was still breathing.

As the saying went, for every grievance, someone is responsible, for every debt, there is a debtor.

The person Chu Feng planned to kill was the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master. After all, he was the one that had nearly killed the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

But, insulting Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan was an enormous crime in itself.

Whilst they could escape death, they would definitely be punished for their crimes.

Whilst they had been crippled by him, Chu Feng felt that it was their deserved punishment.

“Putt~~~”

Suddenly, the sound of someone falling was heard from afar.

Someone had fallen powerlessly onto the ground.

That was someone from the Constellation Immortal Isle.

That person had left earlier to take care of some matters. Upon his return, he discovered that there were traces of battle where the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle were.

Because of that, he did not approach, and had instead hidden himself in order to observe from afar.

Because of that, he’d happened to witness the scene of their Supreme Elder being viciously beaten by Chu Feng.

He did not dare to use his spirit power to sense things, and could only witness everything with his naked eyes.

Because of that, the people that Chu Feng had beaten to a state of unconsciousness were seen to have been beaten to death in his eyes.

It was one thing for their other members. But, even their powerful Supreme Elder was beaten to death. This completely terrified this man, so much so that he fell onto the ground.

He did not dare to linger around, and also did not dare to make a commotion. He immediately got up and began to flee.

The direction he fled toward was the location of the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

He had gone to seek help.

What he didn’t know was that Chu Feng’s gaze had been fixed onto him the moment he moved.

Furthermore, his current gaze was many times more terrifying than the gaze of a frantic beast.

......

The Purple Star Variance Realm was completely different from before.

A lot of peculiar things had occurred here, and many precious treasures had also appeared.

This was something that had never occurred in the past.

The abnormal sign the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief encountered was merely one of many.

Till now, three abnormal signs formed by the gathering of natural energies had been found.

And, without exception, they were all plundered by the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

The Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master was currently using his Star-guiding Stone to absorb the third gathering of natural energies concentrated enough to form an abnormal sign.

Compared to the location where that Supreme Elder was, this place was relatively quiet.

Apart from the noises emitted by the abnormal sign above, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle were all quiet and afraid to speak.

They did not dare disturb their Isle Master.

“Lord Isle Master, this is bad!”

Suddenly, a frantic voice sounded from the distant forest.

Accompanying the voice was the man that had been scared into fleeing by Chu Feng.

“What are you shouting for?!”

“Can you not see that Lord Isle Master is currently refining the natural energies?!” Someone criticized sternly.

Even though his tone was filled with anger, he suppressed his volume so as to not disturb their Lord Isle Master.

Right at this moment, that man arrived before them and kneeled on the ground. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Milord, Lord Supreme Elder is dead!”

“All the people that accompanied him are dead!” the man wailed.

“What did you say?”

“Say it again.”

An aged voice sounded.

It was the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

“Lord Isle Master, Lord Supreme Elder and others are all dead,” the man wept.

“Dead? How did they die?”

“Could they have encountered powerful Purple Star Variance Beasts?” asked the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

“No, it’s not the Purple Star Variance Beasts. They were killed by someone,” said the man.

“Killed by someone?”

The people present all felt shock upon hearing those words.

After all, ever since their Isle Master had defeated the six other leaders on his own, no one among the ten overlord powers dared to oppose them.

Who would dare kill the people from their Constellation Immortal Isle?

“Who killed them? Who dared to kill the people from my Constellation Immortal Isle?” asked the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

“It’s someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan,” said the man.

“What?”

“Chu Heavenly Clan?”

Hearing the name ‘Chu Heavenly Clan,’ the expressions of astonishment on the faces of the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle grew even stronger.

A mere Chu Heavenly Clan dared to kill people from their Constellation Immortal Isle?

No, it wasn’t a matter of whether or not they dared to kill people from their Constellation Immortal Isle.

Even if they dared, they simply did not possess the ability to do so.

“Are you certain that it’s really someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan?” asked the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

“Lord Isle Master, I am absolutely certain.”

“It was that Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation by the name of Chu Feng,” replied that man.

“Chu Feng?”

“Could it be that the rumors are true, and that Chu Feng is truly as powerful as they say?”

Hearing Chu Feng’s name, the crowd that were feeling disbelief before suddenly felt that what that man described might’ve truly occurred.

After all, before they entered the Purple Star Variance Realm, the blue-gowned old man had spread word of Chu Feng’s achievements.

As such, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle had also heard about Chu Feng’s achievements.

Earlier, they did not believe that a single person of the younger generation could be that powerful.

However, now that their Supreme Elder had been killed, they had no choice but to believe it to be true.

“What a Chu Feng.”

“Giving face to the Purple Star Hall, I decided to spare his Chu Heavenly Clan. My action was already one of extreme benevolence.”

“Yet, he actually dared to come kill the people from my Constellation Immortal Isle?”

“No one will be able to save his Chu Heavenly Clan now. Not even the Purple Star Hall will be able to save them.”

“Not only must that Chu Feng die, but I will also have all the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan accompany him in death.”

“I will make everyone realize what sort of price they will have to pay for opposing my Constellation Immortal Isle!”

Anger raged violently in the eyes of the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master.

As he spoke, he put away the Star-guiding Stone in his hand and stopped absorbing the boundless natural energies.

“Show the way. Bring me to that Chu Feng.”

The Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master planned to find Chu Feng to obtain revenge.

Once the Constellation Immortal Isle’s Isle Master gave the order, the morale of the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle immediately surged. They were all overflowing with killing intent.

While they were astonished by Chu Feng’s might, they believed that he would still be undoubtedly killed should their Lord Isle Master act personally.

“No need to search.”

Right at that moment, a voice sounded from the forest.

Looking towards the voice, the expressions of the crowd all turned sluggish.

A figure was walking toward them from within the forest.

While that figure had a humanoid appearance, his eyes were blood-red!

That gaze was very terrifying. It simply did not resemble a gaze that a man should possess.

Bringing them the greatest amount of unease was that the figure was actually dragging something in his hand.

What he was dragging resembled a long snake.

But, upon closer inspection, the crowd were all alarmed.

That was no snake at all. Instead, they were corpses.

Corpses were tied together like a long snake, and being dragged along by that figure.
