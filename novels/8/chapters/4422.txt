Chapter 4422: Come At Me Together

“My apologies, but my elder sister has never talked about you to me before. I am also highly doubtful that she would be acquainted with a person like you.”

Yin Daifen didn’t just look at Chu Feng with scorn. She looked down on everything about him, from his appearance to his background.

Her feelings were shared by those present as well. Right after those words were spoken, laughter erupted from those from the Yu Heavenly Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple.

Having looked down on Chu Feng right from the start, he felt that everything he had done so far was nothing more than a joke.

And having witnessed all of this, Long Xiaoxiao gnashed her teeth in fury.

“What’s wrong with him? Why do you doubt that your elder sister wouldn’t be acquainted with him? Are you and your elder sister so high and mighty that gold runs through your veins?” Long Xiaoxiao snapped at Yin Daifen angrily.

“Are those from the Dragon Clan that disrespectful? I’m only speaking the truth over here, what are you losing your temper over?” Yin Daifen replied coldly.

She had no fear of Long Xiaoxiao at all.

“Junior Yin.”

It was at this moment that the other man from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect stood forward and pulled Yin Daifen back, indicating for her to say no more.

After that, she directed a smile at Long Xiaoxiao and said, “This lady over here, if I’m not mistaken, you’re the princess of the Dragon Clan, right? I am Fu Feiyue, a disciple of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.”

“You’re her senior?” Long Xiaoxiao asked.

“Yes, that’s right,” Fu Feiyue replied.

“Get your junior to watch her mouth. If she dares to run her mouth before my benefactor once more, I’ll rip her mouth from her face,” Long Xiaoxiao uttered coldly.

“You’ll rip my junior’s mouth from her face?”

Upon hearing those words, a wry smile crept onto Fu Feiyue’s mouth.

“Miss, aren’t you getting ahead of yourself? I’m only addressing you politely out of common courtesy, it doesn’t mean that we’re afraid of your Dragon Clan. You should apologize to my junior right now, or else... I’m afraid that I’ll have to take some measures to uphold the dignity of our sect.”

As Fu Feiyue said those words, a powerful oppressive might flowed forth from his body, causing his sleeves to flutter.

Just like Long Xiaoxiao and the others, he was also a rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivator!

“Apologize? You’ll have to ask whether the sword in my hands agrees with that or not!” Long Xiaoxiao replied as she raised the Incomplete Exalted Armament in her grasp.

Judging from how things were going, it seemed like a fight was inevitable.

“This lady over here, are you really intending to go against the prodigies of the Yu Heavenly Clan and Cloudsky Immortal Sect over that hideous man of lowly standing? Just what’s so good about him that you’re so determined to protect him?” the skinny man from the Monstrous Herd Temple asked.

He couldn’t understand just why a beauty like Long Xiaoxiao was so protective of Chu Feng.

“Indeed. Why don’t you take a good look at how he carries himself? His eyes immediately lit up right after seeing Miss Yin from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect. He pretty much pounced on her earlier!

“And right after getting rejected, he claimed that he knew her elder sister, but it turned out that they didn’t have any relationship either. He’s just a lecherous man. It’s not worth protecting a person like that!” the muscular man from the Monstrous Herd Temple added.

Their words were filled with insults toward Chu Feng, but at the same time, it also revealed their envy toward him.

That was right. They were envious at how the hideous Chu Feng was actually able to earn the favor of Long Xiaoxiao.

At the same time, the other two men from the Yu Heavenly Sect and Fu Feiyue from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect also relentlessly put Chu Feng down before Long Xiaoxiao, hoping to lower Long Xiaoxiao’s view of Chu Feng.

In just a few moments, everyone in the area was already filled with hostility for Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had never said or done anything to offend him, but all of sudden, he turned into the public enemy over here. The antagonism that was directed toward him especially intensified when he mentioned that he was from the Chu Heavenly Clan of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

If everything they had said before could still be passed off as ‘joking around’, what they were doing at this moment was indubitably humiliating him.

Just because Chu Feng had a hideous appearance and had come from a humble background, these prodigies of high standing viewed him as an eyesore and wanted to outcast him.

“You!!!”

Long Xiaoxiao’s face flushed in fury.

She snapped her weapon forward, intending to teach the six people before her a lesson.

Pah!

But all of a sudden, a hand stretched forth and grabbed Long Xiaoxiao’s wrist, stopping her.

It was Chu Feng.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, you need not hold it against them,” Chu Feng replied.

“But little benefactor, they...” Long Xiaoxiao was unwilling to let the matter rest just like that.

“Listen to my words,” Chu Feng insisted with a smile.

Long Xiaoxiao was clearly hesitant for a moment before she nodded her head reluctantly, saying, “Alright, I’ll listen to little benefactor’s words.”

And following that, a sweet smile actually blossomed on her lips, replacing the furious expression she had a moment ago. When she looked at Chu Feng, her twinkling eyes carried a gentleness reminiscent of a bed of cotton.

It formed a stark contrast against the attitude she directed toward the other six just a moment ago.

Putting aside those five men around, even Yin Daifen was a little dumbstruck by this turn of events.

Regardless of whether she liked Long Xiaoxiao as a person or not, she had to admit that Long Xiaoxiao was a rare beauty. When Chu Feng stood beside her, their disparity was even greater than that between a swan and a toad.

Yin Daifen couldn’t understand why someone like Long Xiaoxiao, who had strength, beauty, and a lofty standing, would actually fancy a hideous monster from a lowly background with Chu Feng.

“Hey, just what kind of sorcery did you cast on this miss to make her so loyal to you?”

“Yes, hurry up and spit it out! Just what did a lowly creature like you do to her?”

The disciples from the Yu Heavenly Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple questioned indignantly.

“Curious? This is what you call the charm of a man. It’s just that you, you, you, you, and you...”

Chu Feng pointed at the five men from the Yu Heavenly Clan, Monstrous Herd Temple, and Cloudsky Immortal Sect one after another before finally completing his sentence, “... will never come to appreciate what being a true man entails.”

“What bullshit are you spouting over here?”

“Do you even know who we are? How dare you say that we have no manly charm?”

Chu Feng’s words immediately incurred the rage of the five men.

In the first place, they thought of the lowly Chu Feng as nothing more than trash, and breathing the same air as him was an insult to them. If not for Long Xiaoxiao, they would have already smashed him into bits by now.

Yet, who could have thought that the trash in their eyes would actually dare to look down on them?

“Why are you all getting angry? Ah, did I get your sore spot? I’m not finished yet though.

“I would like to add on that you lots are wastrels that squander away the resources your clans provide to you. People of your caliber really are undeserving of undergoing the training of the Godwish Palace,” Chu Feng added on.

“You’re courting death!”

Right after those words sounded, a sword hacked down in Chu Feng’s direction. The man known as Yu Hong from the Yu Heavenly Clan had made a move on Chu Feng.

This slash not only shattered the earth, it even sliced the air into two.

Yu Hong had not held back in his attack at all. His intention was clear—he would take Chu Feng’s life.

It was just that Long Xiaoxiao was already prepared for this. From the moment Yu Hong raised his sword, she had already unleashed a palms strike toward him.

Roarrr!

The ferocious draconic cry sounded as a golden dragon charged forth and dissipated the sword rays directed toward Chu Feng.

“You trash! If you have any shred of dignity as a man at all, stop hiding behind a woman’s back!” Yu Hong roared at Chu Feng angrily.

“You aren’t worthy of fighting my benefactor at all. If you want to lay your hands on him, you’ll have to walk over my...” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But before Long Xiaoxiao could finish her words, Chu Feng had already placed his hand on her shoulder to stop her, saying, “Lass, didn’t I tell you to ignore them?”

“But little benefactor...” Long Xiaoxiao protested indignantly.

She was put in a spot as to whether she should teach these fellows a lesson or to heed Chu Feng’s words.

“Lass, this is a problem for me to handle. You should leave it to me. I’ll deal with those trash by myself,” Chu Feng replied.

“What did that trash just say? Did he just say that he would deal with me? Surely I’m hearing things?”

As soon as Chu Feng spoke those words, Yu Hong burst into a peal of laughter as he glanced at Chu Feng contemptuously. In his view, Chu Feng was simply spouting empty words.

How could Chu Feng possibly dare to fight him?

On the other hand, Chu Feng stood forward and rose to the air.

This gesture took the other six people present by surprise. It would appear that Chu Feng was not joking around, and he was really intending to accept Yu Hong’s challenge? No matter how they thought about it, they didn’t think that Chu Feng would be so foolish as to jump into his own grave!

As a lowly man who had come from a trashy starfield, how in the world did he find the confidence in himself to fight against the strongest prodigy from the strongest Heavenly Clan in the Nine Souls Galaxy?

Meanwhile, Chu Feng, who had already stepped forward, glanced down at five people before him and said, “Stop wasting time. You, you, you, you, and you...”

One by one, Chu Feng pointed at Yu Hong, Yu Yin, Fu Feiyue, and the two prodigies from the Monstrous Herd Temple before he continued, “Come at me together.”
