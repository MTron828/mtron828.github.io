Chapter 5106: Returning to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm

Chu Feng wanted the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to help with looking for the deranged old granny whom he had previously met.

When he heard from Miaomiao that the old granny would murmur the name ‘Hanxian’ from time to time, he realized that she might just be the grandmother whom he had been trying to find all this while.

Of course, he didn’t tell anyone that the mysterious old granny might be his grandmother. He simply said that he was indebted to that elder and wanted to repay her favor.

The Nine Souls Sacred Clan was already looking for her in the first place, and Chu Feng’s request only made them devote more resources to the search.

Following that, Chu Feng left the Nine Souls Sacred Clan together with Shengguang Baimei, the Lady of Dao Sea, and the others. They made their way toward the Monstrous Spirit Clan together.

The first thing Chu Feng and the others realized upon arriving at their destination was that the spirit formation gate had changed. The previously powerful spirit formation gate had vanished without a trace, replaced with a simpler and weaker one.

This new spirit formation gate was just a simple entrance that anyone, regardless of whether they were a junior or an elder, could pass through without a hitch.

The group passed through the spirit formation gate, and what they saw on the other end astonished them.

The Monstrous Spirit Clan had been massacred.

The matter came as a huge shock to them. They couldn’t imagine why such an incident would happen out of the blue or who could be the culprit behind this atrocity.

To uncover the truth, Chu Feng started questioning the Lady of Dao Sea’s disciples, who had been cultivating in the vicinity of the Monstrous Spirit Clan. There was a good chance that they might know something.

However, those disciples said that they didn’t notice anything at all.

This made Chu Feng and the others realize that something was really wrong here.

The spirit formation gate that sealed off the Monstrous Spirit Clan was not to be made light of. How could it just vanish just like that? On top of that, the sculpture of the man worshiped by the Monstrous Spirit Clan had disappeared too.

Could it be that there was a traitor in the Monstrous Spirit Clan? Or was it the doing of an enemy?

It was one thing if the culprit was a traitor, but if it was the doing of an enemy, how powerful would that person be to be able to forcefully destroy that powerful spirit formation gate?

“Chu Feng, it’s not safe to stay here. Let’s leave this place,” the Lady of Dao Sea said.

She was not a cowardly person, but it was clear to her that the culprit behind this massacre was not someone to be trifled with. It was dangerous for them to stay here.

Chu Feng wanted to exact vengeance for those from the Monstrous Spirit Clan, but he wasn’t confident that he would be able to do so. Thus, he decided not to linger in the area.

Before he left, he used a special means to collect the blood of those from the Monstrous Spirit Clan. He created different tombs for them depending on their blood and buried them in a discreet area.

“Chu Feng, there’s something really weird about this matter. It might be related to the powerful man who visited the Monstrous Spirit Clan tens of thousands of years ago. I think it’d be best for you not to get involved in this,” the Lady of Dao Sea advised.

“The world of cultivation is really not peaceful,” Chu Feng said with a helpless sigh.

He wanted to interfere in this matter if possible since the Monstrous Spirit Clan did help them, but he knew that he didn’t have the means to do so. His intuition told him that the person who massacred the Monstrous Spirit Clan was beyond his means to deal with.

“Lele, you should take the puppet army since it’s no longer possible to return them to their owner,” Chu Feng said.

There were three people who could control the puppet army: Chu Feng, Wang Yuxian, and Sima Xiangtu. Since Sima Xiangtu was dead, the only ones left were Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian.

Chu Feng was worried about the safety of Wang Yuxian and the others since there were many people who knew that he was on good terms with them. If the Pill Dao Immortal Sect reneged on their promise, Wang Yuxian and the others could possibly get implicated in the matter.

It would put his mind at ease if Wang Yuxian and the others could keep the puppet army with them.

“Chu Feng, why don’t you take the puppet army with you?” Wang Yuxian asked.

“Silly girl. The puppet army might be powerful, but I have the Asura World Spirit Army with me now, remember?” Chu Feng said.

“Oh right. I nearly forgot about it. Alright, you can leave the puppet with me for the time being,” Wang Yuxian said.

Soon, Chu Feng bade farewell to Wang Yuxian and the others.

“Young friend Chu Feng, where do you intend to head next?” Shengguang Buyu asked.

“I’m intending to return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

Chu Feng found that his clansmen had been kidnapped by a mysterious man the last time he returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. That mysterious man was extremely powerful, such that he wasn’t a match for him.

However, he wasn't the same weakling he used to be anymore. He was much stronger as a cultivator and a world spiritist, and he had the Asura World Spirit Army under his command. He knew that it was unlikely for the mysterious man to still be there, but he thought that it was worthwhile to conduct another search so as to see if the mysterious man had left any clues behind.

After learning that Chu Feng was going to return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, and Daoist Niantian decided to accompany him.

Chu Feng accepted their company, and the group of them swiftly made their way to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Chu Feng was intending to head straight to the place where he met the mysterious man, but when he heard that the Holy Light Clan had constructed a new base for the Chu Heavenly Clan, he decided to take a look at that first.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s turf was different from how he remembered it to be. It had expanded significantly, and there were countless majestic buildings to be seen here and there. Huge crowds watched upon them from the distance with envy and admiration in their eyes. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After all, the ones who built this turf were the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy, the Holy Light Clan.

The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was fairly isolated, so few cultivators there were aware of Chu Feng’s feats, but when they saw the almighty Holy Light Clan descending upon the realm and personally constructing palaces for the Chu Heavenly Clan, they knew right away that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s standing had risen beyond imagination.

From the discussions, the crowd knew that this matter was related to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng and the others didn’t show themselves. They entered the Chu Heavenly Clan in their hidden state. He merely took a cursory look around before entering the depths of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

He knew that the Holy Light Clan was just fawning on him, so he wasn’t too interested in the new palaces. What he was more interested in were the old palaces of the Chu Heavenly Clan since those were memories to him.

“She’s here too?”

Chu Feng soon spotted a beautiful silhouette that made his face lit up: Chu Lingxi.
