Chapter 5776: Obtaining a God Armament

“Secret Skill: Dark Plunder.”

The black aura began flowing from Huangfu Fanni’s body back into Chu Feng’s body.

“Gah!” Huangfu Fanni cried in pain and agony.

His Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, Lightning Wings, and the God Taboo Martial Skill he had fused into his God Armament flowed via the black aura into Chu Feng’s body. When the black aura finally left his body, Huangfu Fanni’s pain vanished.

All of a sudden, he was perfectly fine as if what had happened earlier was just an illusion.

“What did you do to me?” Huangfu Fanni stared at Chu Feng fearfully.

He had no idea what Chu Feng had just done. He had sensed the black aura peering through his entire being, so much so that he thought it would siphon his soul away, but he survived the ordeal without losing anything.

It could be that the black aura was simply not as terrifying as it seemed, but Huangfu Fanni still felt like something was amiss. The black aura was simply too scary.

“Huangfu Fanni, I don’t have the patience to play with you, so I’ll give you one last chance to defeat me. Fail, and I’ll kill you,” Chu Feng said.

“Stop dodging and blocking my attacks then! Stand still and let me exert my means on you,” Huangfu Fanni said.

He was scared. He had already resorted to a God Taboo, but it was unraveled by Chu Feng’s bizarre means before he could even unleash it. It was not just how terrifying the black aura was, but how fast Chu Feng had reacted to it too.

At this rate, he would really fall in defeat.

“Huangfu Fanni, you’re getting over your head! Why don’t you tell Chu Feng to become your punching bag instead?” Long Chengyu berated.

Huang Fanni’s request was ridiculous.

Yet, Chu Feng replied with a smile, “Sure.”

“You said it yourself,” Huangfu Fanni replied.

He hurriedly retreated a safe distance away before unleashing his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings. This time around, his fighting prowess conspicuously rose above his previous peak.

“Is it the forbidden medicine Huangfu Shengyu previously consumed?”

Chu Feng sensed that the rise in Huangfu Fanni’s fighting prowess was strikingly similar to Huangfu Shengyu’s back when he was fighting with Xianhai Shaoyu. It was likely that he had consumed the same forbidden medicine as Huangfu Shengyu did.

The forbidden medicine was likely hidden in their bodies.

Tzzz!

Lightning crackled, as Huangfu Fanni summoned the gigantic lightning flood dragon once more.

“You’re indeed a prodigy,” Chu Feng remarked.

Taboo Martial Skills couldn’t be executed consecutively within a short period of time, though this limit could be overcome if one was talented enough to grasp the martial skill at a deeper level. However, it was much harder to overcome this limit when it came to God Taboo Martial Skills.

The fact that Huangfu Fanni was able to execute two God Taboo Martial Skills consecutively showed just how talented he was. There was no doubt his talent surpassed that of Qin Xuan and Long Chengyu. It might even be on par with Huangfu Jiangyao and Huangfu Shengyu.

And this was the kind of opponent Chu Feng wanted to face.

“Good. This is a good opportunity for me to see if I can properly execute martial skills stolen via Dark Plunder,” Chu Feng said as he tightly grasped the Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

A tremendous surge of lightning burst forth from Chu Feng’s body, manifesting into a gigantic lightning flood dragon behind him. It looked identical to Huangfu Fanni’s, but it was larger and even more powerful.

“It works.” Chu Feng was excited.

Dark Plunder was the secret skill he had created using the Dao of Absolute Darkness as its foundation. He could steal a person’s martial skill, secret skill, and even their world spirits, as long as the other party had displayed it once before. Furthermore, for a short period of time, the martial skills he had stolen would be even stronger than the original.

This was Chu Feng’s first time executing Dark Plunder, and it didn’t disappoint him. Moreover, he hadn’t fully grasped what Dark Plunder was capable of, which meant that it could have other abilities waiting to be unlocked.

This was the prowess of the Dao of Absolute Darkness. Perhaps, Dark Plunder could become his strongest means one day.

While Chu Feng was excited about the situation, the others, particularly Huangfu Fanni, were horrified.

“W-who in the world are you?” Huangfu Fanni trembled in fear, knowing that this God Taboo Martial Skill was created by his ancestor. There was no way an outsider could have learned it.

Chu Feng didn’t answer Huangfu Fanni’s question. He pointed his sword at Huangfu Fanni and said with a smile, “God Taboo: Lightning Flood Dragon!”

Grarr!

Chu Feng’s lightning flood dragon rushed at Huangfu Fanni, prompting the latter to unleash his lightning flood dragon too.

The two God Taboo Martial Skills collided, raising terrifying shockwaves that sent Long Chengyu, Qin Xuan, and Xian Miaomiao retreating to the corner. Some of them even brought out their treasures to deal with the shockwaves.

There was no need for them to do so though, as the shockwaves didn’t even get close to them. Chu Feng was the one who had stopped the shockwaves from reaching them.

Naturally, Chu Feng was safe and sound.

On the other hand, Huangfu Fanni fell from the sky with his body covered in blood. He was in a terribly weakened state, practically on the verge of death.

Long Chengyu and Qin Xuan exchanged glances. They didn’t say a word, but their eyes seemed to be saying: This is too terrifying. We aren’t on the same level at all.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

All of Huangfu Fanni’s possessions tore away from him as he fell from the sky, from his Cosmos Sack to his clothes. Xian Miaomiao quickly averted her gaze in astonishment.

It was Chu Feng’s doing. He was stripping Huangfu Fanni of his possessions.

“This God Armament is not as powerful as Huangfu Jiangyao’s and Huangfu Shengyu’s, but it’s the best one I have at the moment. I should make do with it for the time being,” Chu Feng held onto Huangfu Fanni’s black God Armament spear as he spoke.

“Hehehe…” Huangfu Fanni sneered coldly. “I know what you’re thinking, Chu Feng, but that’s my God Armament. You can’t take it for your own, as it has already…”

Huangfu Fanni’s words slowly faded into silence as he watched Chu Feng pump his bloodline power into the God Armament.

Soon, Chu Feng’s aura fused with the God Armament, and his fighting prowess started to visibly grow. At the same time, lightning crackled from the God Armament.

Huangfu Fanni was dumbstruck. His body convulsed as if he had suffered a huge shock. As a Huangfu Heavenly Clansman, he knew what that lightning meant.

His ancestors had hired the strongest world spiritists of the Ancient Era to forge God Armaments for the Huangfu Heavenly Clansmen, and his spear was one of these equipment. These God Armaments could be used once tamed, but if the God Armament was very satisfied with its new owner, it would emanate lightning to signify its happiness.

That was why Huangfu Jiangyao’s and Huangfu Shengyu’s God Armaments crackled with lightning as soon as they were drawn. That was what Huangfu Fanni had been working toward for many years now, but Chu Feng achieved it the moment he laid his hands on his spear.

“My apologies, but this God Armament is mine now.”

With a flick of his wrist, Chu Feng stowed the God Armament and all of the treasures he had plundered from Huangfu Fanni into his own Cosmos Sack. All of a sudden, he remembered a matter and asked, “Speaking of which, Huangfu Fanni, what were you going to say earlier?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Huangfu Fanni spurted a mouthful of blood. He couldn’t even summon enough strength to climb to his feet, so he could only lay weakly on the floor. All of a sudden, he burst into manic laughter.

“Hahahaha! Gahahaha! The world is unfair! The world is unfair!” he screeched before his body disintegrated into bits.

Huangfu Fanni was dead.
