Chapter 5206: Biased

“One of the Nine Great Godsouls? Is this really one of the Nine Great Godsouls you spoke of?”

Old Cat began salivating out of excitement. This was the kind of treasure he had devoted his life to uncovering! Right now, he just wanted to know whether the silhouette before him was really the legendary Nine Great Godsouls Tao Wu had spoken of.

“It’s likely to be it,” Tao Wu replied.

“We’ve struck gold! Oh my god, we’re going to make it big! Brother Chu Feng, what did I tell you? Risks and opportunities come hand in hand. It’s lucky that we came, or else we would have missed out on this rare treasure!” Old Cat cheered as it began dancing joyfully.

“Old Kitty, don’t get so excited just yet. As powerful as the Nine Great Godsouls are, it cannot be fused with a cultivator coming from the world of cultivation,” Tao Wu said.

“It cannot be fused with a cultivator coming from the world of cultivation? What do you mean by that?”

Old Cat’s face immediately crumbled upon hearing those words. Even Chu Feng looked surprised too.

“Simply said, none of us here are able to use it,” Tao Wu said.

“We can’t use it? What’s the point of having a treasure like that if it’s just going to be useless?” Old Cat said in disappointment.

“We might be unable to use it, but world spirits can. If a world spirit obtains the Nine Great Godsouls, their intelligence will be greatly boosted. They’ll be able to find their own unique cultivation path even in the world of cultivation, such that they would no longer be reliant on just devouring origin energies to grow stronger,” Tao Wu said.

“After all that has been said and done, this treasure is just fodder for world spirits,” Old Cat said with a sigh.

“Of course it’s for world spirits. Why else do you think it’ll appear here? My guess is that the Godsoul used to belong to the powerful world spirit inside the demon coffin. The world spirit might have gotten refined, but the Godsoul was left behind.

“That’s probably also why the person who set up this formation placed so many trials along the way. He was probably intending to leave this Godsoul to someone he deems worthy. So, what do you intend to do now? Do you want to continue exploring the ancient remnant? You should know that the subsequent trials will be highly dangerous. There’s a high chance of losing your life here,” Tao Wu said.

“There’s only one of these Nine Great Godsouls here even if we obtained it. Why don’t we sell it and exchange it for treasures of equivalent value? We’ll split it three ways afterward,” Old Cat said.

“Sell it? Look at those two spirit formation gates. The right one can only be accessed by world spirits whereas we can only enter the left one. Do you know what this means?” Tao Wu asked.

“Could it be that a world spirit has to fuse together with its world spiritist in order to acquire the Godsoul?” Old Cat asked.

“That’s not all. The world spiritist and his world spirit will likely have to separately undergo trials of their own. Only when the two of them have cleared all of the trials will they earn the acknowledgment of the Godsoul. By then, the Godsoul will automatically fuse into the body of the world spirit. How do you intend to sell it after that happens?” Tao Wu asked.

“If that’s the case, doesn’t that mean that the Godsoul is going to either the Daoist Eighth Dragon or Daoist Ninth Dragon?” Old Cat said.

“That’s hard to say. There are many variables at play here,” Tao Wu replied.

“Many variables or not, it all boils down to strength. Are you able to defeat Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon? Are your world spirits able to defeat their world spirits?” Old Cat said.

“Look at how scared you are. How do you know that things won’t work out when you haven’t even given it a try yet?” Tao Wu sneered.

He then turned to Chu Feng and asked, “Young brother Chu Feng, what do you make of the situation?”

“I don’t want to miss this fortuitous encounter. I’d like to give it a try,” Chu Feng said.

“Good. That’s more like it.”

Tao Wu opened his world spirit gate and allowed a rank four Half-God level Demon World Spirit out. It first bowed to Tao Wu before heading toward the right spirit formation gate where only world spirits were able to access.

“You have a rank four Half-God level, and Chu Feng has one too. I don’t stand a chance here at all. Ey, I guess I’ll just join in the commotion then,” Old Cat said.

It released a rank three Half-God level female Beast World Spirit. She looked a lot more beautiful than most Beast World Spirits, though such looks could only count as average when compared to human beauties.

“Milord, I’ll be heading in now,” the female world spirit told Old Cat with a smile.

She didn’t bow to him, and her attitude was lax too. Despite addressing Old Cat as ‘milord’, it sounded more as if she was conversing with a friend.

“Be careful. There are lots of powerful fellows in there. Return right away if you find yourself in danger. It’s not worth giving up your life for a mere fortuitous encounter,” Old Cat said.

Chu Feng was surprised to see Old Cat getting worried over its world spirit. Seeing that the other two had already sent their world spirits in, he also opened his World Spirit Space and Eggy walked out from within.

“What a beautiful Asura World Spirit!”

Tao Wu’s eyes lit up at the sight of Eggy.

He couldn’t be blamed for reacting in such a manner considering Eggy’s unparalleled beauty. All men, regardless of age, wouldn’t be able to resist sparing a second glance at her.

Eggy ignored Tao Wu and walked straight over to Chu Feng’s side.

“You have anything to say?” Eggy asked with her eyes curled into sweet crescents.

She didn’t seem nervous in the least. If anything, she looked expectant.

“Eggy, be careful.”

Despite Eggy’s confidence, Chu Feng couldn’t help but be worried about her.

“What do you have to worry about this Queen? You should be the one who should be careful. Make sure you come out in one piece. Don’t put your life on the line for this. Remember, I won’t let you off if you receive even the slightest injury,” Eggy warned.

“Got it,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“What the hell are you two doing, flirting in front of us? You should consider the feelings of old folks like us! Haa, youngsters nowadays…” Old Cat cried out in envy.

“That old furry thing over there, don’t make me slap the living daylights out of you,” Eggy raised her palm and threatened.

If not for her being weaker than Old Cat, she would have likely already dished out the slap. Knowing that she was in a weaker position, she could only intimidate Old Cat before heading into the spirit formation gate. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“That lass is still arrogant as before, but she’s indeed beautiful. It’s no wonder why Brother Chu Feng is so obsessed with her.”

It was then that Old Cat realized that Chu Feng had already closed his World Spirit Space.

“Wait a moment, you’re letting that lass enter alone? Why don’t you send your rank four Half-God level world spirit in too?” Old Cat asked in incomprehension.

“Are you that dull-witted, Old Cat? Haven’t you realized that each person can only send a single world spirit in?” Tao Wu said.

“Was there such a restriction?”

Old Cat released another Beast World Spirit, one who was weaker and less good-looking than the one before. It was intending to test out what Tao Wu had just said. Just as it had been told, its second world spirit was unable to enter the spirit formation gate.

“The hell! I was really dumb to have not noticed the restriction. Brother Chu Feng, it looks like you’re really biased toward that lass. You were able to tell that only one world spirit was allowed inside, but you chose her over your rank four Half-God level world spirit. Just how much do you hope that he’ll be able to obtain the Godsoul?”

Old Cat looked at Chu Feng admiringly.

Chu Feng could only let out an awkward laugh. The truth was that he hadn’t seen through the restriction either. Eggy simply happened to be his only world spirit who was available at the moment, though he would have still chosen her even if he had a choice.

While Old Cat often talked a lot of nonsense, there was one thing that it got right—Chu Feng was biased toward Eggy.
