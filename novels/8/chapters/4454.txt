Chapter 4454: Unqualified

No one expected the bizarre-looking woman to proclaim their deaths, and they were utterly horrified by the situation.

By the time the proclamation was made, a surge of energy had already wrapped itself around them, sealing their routes of escape.

This surge of energy might be invisible to the eye, but its malevolent nature was clearly felt by both experts and the juniors alike.

It was almost as if a furious specter was on their tail, seeking to reap their souls.

“Father, what do we do?”

Long Xiaoxiao was deeply frightened by this situation, and she clutched her father’s robe fearfully.

In the face of true danger, the one that she ended up relying on was still her father.

However, the situation was already beyond the control of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others. Even they had no idea what to do either, for the energy that had surrounded them was far beyond their ability to deal with.

“Elder, we know that we have made the wrong choice, but it’s a decision we made in an illusion. We have not hurt anyone in reality, so surely our actions don’t deserve death?”

“Indeed, elder! Please have mercy on us and give us a chance!”

Those amongst the crowd quickly spoke up in seek of redemption.

Some pleaded for mercy while some tried to reason their way out of the situation. Ultimately, their goal was the same—they wanted to live.

“There’s no need to panic yet. It’s not as if your fates have been sealed yet,” the bizarre-looking woman spoke with a light tone.

“Is there still a way out of this?”

“Elder, as long as you’re willing to spare us, we’re more than willing to serve you!”

“Elder, please feel free to tell us anything you need from us!”

In the end, it was the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others in leadership positions who stood forward and represented everyone else to speak to the bizarre-looking woman.

Realizing that there was a chance at survival, they quickly expressed their willingness to do anything as long as they were allowed to live.

Long Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but feel deeply uncomfortable at this sight. Her lofty and almighty father was taking such a humble position to beg with another person.

It jolted her deeply to see such a sight, but at the same time, it also affirmed her will once more.

She swore that she would grow stronger and rise to the top. Only when she commanded power greater than anyone else would she finally be able to grasp control over her fate. Otherwise, like her father, she would be forced to bow down helplessly to those who were stronger than her.

“What can trash like the lot of you possibly do for me?”

However, the bizarre-looking lady only snorted in disdain after hearing their words.

“The ones who can change your fate isn’t me but the two of them over there. They are the only ones who can save you,” the bizarre-looking woman gestured toward Chu Feng and the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother with her chin as she spoke.

Those words caused the hearts of the crowd to clench tightly together.

Only Chu Feng and the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother could save them?

The feeling where their fate was entrusted into the hands of another made them feel deeply uncomfortable.

“How so?” Chu Feng asked.

“Do you wish to save them?” the bizarre-looking woman asked.

“I have friends amongst them. I can’t leave them be,” Chu Feng replied.

Hearing those words, the heart of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief calmed down a little, and Long Xiaoxiao directed a touched look toward Chu Feng.

Meanwhile, the others were starting to feel a little panicked.

They were well aware that the ‘friends’ Chu Feng spoke about referred to Long Xiaoxiao and those from the Dragon Clan. After all, they were allied with one another.

What would become of them then?

“Brother Chu Feng, can you... save us too?”

After a long moment of internal turmoil, Kui Wudi still chose to speak up and ask.

To be honest, he didn’t think that he was close enough with Chu Feng to warrant the latter to save them, but given the dire situation they were already in, he still wanted to give it a try nevertheless.

In truth, even if Kui Wudi hadn’t asked that question, Chu Feng would have still chosen to save them too. Earlier, when Chu Feng was in danger, the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster stepped in and stood against the Yu Heavenly Clan and the Cloudsky Immortal Sect on his behalf.

Given Chu Feng’s personality, he would surely return this debt of gratitude to them.

In contrast, however, those from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect and Yu Heavenly Clan were in no position to ask such a favor from Chu Feng, and this left them feeling deeply distressed.

“Young man, you shouldn’t be so hasty in your decisions. You should wait for me to finish my words first.

“You’re indeed able to save them, but you’ll have to pay a price for that. The more people you attempt to save, the heavier the price you’ll have to pay. Perhaps, you might even lose your life.

“On the other hand, if you choose to save none of them, you wouldn’t have to pay any price at all. You can step right into the Ancient Era’s Tomb of Armaments, and there are plenty of fortuitous encounters waiting for you in there. With sufficient luck, you might even be able to obtain a top-notch Exalted Armament from the Ancient Era,” the bizarre-looking woman told Chu Feng.

Huaji!

As she said those words, the blood-red door located at the bottom of the rock mountain began to creak open.

The door only opened by a mere crack, but it was more than enough for a person to pass through it.

However, it was utterly dark inside the crack. It was impossible to tell what was lurking within the darkness.

Of course, most of the crowd present wasn’t in a position to wonder what was within the crack either. They were feeling far too anxious about their current plights to care about anything else.

Even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was staring at Chu Feng with a complicated look in his eyes... He, too, was feeling uneasy.

He was afraid that Chu Feng might refuse to save them over the opportunity to obtain an Exalted Armament, for he knew that that was the decision he would have made had he been in Chu Feng’s position.

“Elder, may I head in now?” the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother suddenly asked.

“Have you made your decision?” the bizarre-looking woman asked.

“The livelihood of these people has nothing to do with me,” the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother replied.

While none of them expected the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother to save them right from the start, they still couldn’t help but feel a lurching sensation in their hearts when they heard those words from her.

Her decision had pushed them a step closer toward the endless abyss.

“Very well. That’s a wise decision you have made. Since you have already made up your mind, you may head in now,” the bizarre-looking woman said.

So, the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother quickly made her way toward the blood-red door. The energy which had surrounded the crowd hadn’t impeded her movements in the least.

Soon, she disappeared within the crack of the blood-red door.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you can’t just leave us in the lurch!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Chu Feng, we know that we have done you wrong in the past, and we sincerely apologize for that. Please show some magnanimity and forgive our ignorance. I’m pleading with you, please save us!”

A huge commotion suddenly broke out in the surroundings.

In the end, staring right in the face of death, the crowd was still unable to hold themselves back. They began begging Chu Feng desperately.

Even though they knew that they were unworthy of his salvation, and that it was impossible for him to save all of them, they still couldn’t help themselves from doing it. This was simply the instinct of a living being to clutch onto life.

“Silence!”

The bizarre-looking woman suddenly bellowed sharply.

Her roar caused a sinister shriek to reverberate from the energy shrouding the crowd, emanating a deadly aura that immediately prompted everyone to zip up their mouths.

“It was just a moment ago that you attempted to take his life, and yet, you still have the cheek to ask him to save you now? Years of cultivation might not have turned you into experts, but it sure did temper your skin to be quite thick!” the bizarre-looking woman mocked them sarcastically.

Hearing those words, most amongst the crowd hung their heads in shame.

This was especially so for Yu Hong, Yu Yin, Yin Daifen, and the others. Their complexions looked more awful than ever.

They recalled how they had reneged against their words and attempted to use everything they had to crush Chu Feng. After baring their vile fangs at him, they were no longer qualified to beg for Chu Feng’s help.
