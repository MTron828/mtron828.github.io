Chapter 3369 - The Powerful Bai Liluo

“Lord Clan Chief, someone has breached the sealing formation!”

“Furthermore, they have injured our clansmen!”

A branch clansman cried out in alarm.

Once he finished saying those words, two figures flew over and landed in the main clan’s crowd, beside the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

The two of them were naturally Chu Feng and Bai Liluo.

After they landed, even the branch clan’s clan chief Wuma Yantian started to frown. As for the others from the branch clan, there was no need to mention the expressions they had at that moment.

They who were standing high and above like gods earlier were feeling uneasy at that moment.

After all, the aura that Bai Liluo was emitting was that of a rank nine Exalted.

Her aura was an entire level above that of their Lord Clan Chief.

They knew very well what that represented.

They all knew that trouble had come.

“I’ve truly underestimated you all. You actually managed to request the assistance of such a helper.”

Wuma Yantian looked to the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. The killing intent in his eyes intensified.

“Those two are helpers Lord Clan Chief requested?”

“So Lord Clan Chief was prepared!”

“We’re saved now, saved!”

Once Wuma Yantian’s words were heard, all of the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen were overjoyed. They felt as if they’d managed to escape from the gates of hell.

Rank nine Exalted. That sort of cultivation was sufficient to take on all of the branch clan’s men.

Because everything had happened so suddenly, many Wuma Heavenly Clansmen began crying tears of joy. The crying sounds of the vast crowd did not decrease, but increased instead. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

They were crying earlier because of despair. And now, they were crying because they saw hope.

That said, both the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s branch clansmen and the main clansmen had no idea that even the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was feeling completely bewildered.

Even though he had requested assistance from several powers, those powers did not even bother to respond to his requests, much less agree to help them. As such, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had already given up all hope.

Yet, two people had suddenly appeared. Furthermore, one among them was even a peak Exalted-level expert. This came as a great surprise to the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Not to mention the others, even he was completely bewildered.

He had already thought of all the people that could possibly come to their assistance.

Yet, he was unable to find two people that matched the two beside him.

“Branch clansmen, don’t you all bully them intolerably,” Chu Feng said loudly. Of course, his voice had been altered. Thus, not even the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief or Wuma Shengjie were able to recognize his voice.

“Who are you? How dare you meddle in others’ business!” Wuma Yantian spoke coldly. Although Chu Feng and Bai Liluo’s appearance had caused him to become greatly distressed, he did not show any sign of fear.

“Who I am is not important. What’s important is that what you all are doing is truly intolerable.”

“The main clan has already accepted your shameless and unreasonable demand. Yet, you branch clansmen still want to eradicate them. Do you even possess any humanity?” Chu Feng asked.

What Chu Feng said struck Wuma Yantian’s sore spot, and greatly enraged him. He pointed to Chu Feng and cursed out, “Son of a bitch, who the fuck are you calling branch clan?! Who?!”

“We are the main clan! Even if there is such a branch clan, it would be that bunch of trash... definitely not us!”

Wuma Yantian’s voice was not only akin to thunder, but it was also filled with killing intent. It would appear that he was truly enraged.

“Once a branch clan, always a branch clan. You all need to face reality and not try to deceive yourselves. If you all weren’t the branch clan, why would you try to bully the main clan like this? Isn’t it because of the hard feelings from the past that you all want to retaliate against them now?”

“Speaking of it, when the main clan was in power, they didn’t bully you excessively, and also did not attempt to exterminate you.”

“However, look at you and your conduct today. This is simply a clear-cut contrast of good and evil.”

“In terms of one’s mindset, you from the branch clan cannot even compare to the main clan in the slightest. It is no wonder you are the branch clan, and they’re the main clan.”

“I believe... your mindset is the cause of your disparity,” Chu Feng continued.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen nodded in their hearts.

What Chu Feng said was precisely the feelings in their hearts.

Back when they of the main clan were rich and powerful, even though they suppressed the branch clan, they merely pushed them around and made things difficult for them. In the end, they still considered them to be from the same clan.

It was completely unlike how those people from the branch clan wanted to eradicate them.

However, Chu Feng’s words enraged the branch clansmen even more.

This was especially true for Wuma Yantian. At that moment, he stood up from his seat.

Not only did he have a furious look on his face and surging killing intent emitting all over his body, but a Heaven level Lightning Mark also emerged on his forehead.

With the appearance of the Heaven level Lightning Mark, Wuma Yantian’s cultivation increased from rank eight Exalted to rank nine Exalted.

“Although I do not know who you are, I will take your damned dog life because of what you just said!” After Wuma Yantian finished speaking, the surrounding air became piercingly cold. Everyone knew that he was about to attack.

“Wait.”

However, Bai Liluo’s voice was suddenly heard at that moment.

Once she spoke, everyone was surprised. This included the completely enraged Wuma Yantian, who had planned to take care of Chu Feng. He actually immediately withdrew his intention to attack.

They were all able to tell that the person who had spoken sounded like a little girl.

That voice was not that of a young girl. Instead, it was the voice of a child, a little girl’s voice.

Most importantly, they were able to tell that the aura of rank nine Exalted was being emitted by the shorter of the two mysterious people.

Merely, no one had expected the shorter of the two to be a little girl.

Was she deliberately disguising herself as a little girl, or could she really be a little girl?

At that moment, everyone, including Wuma Yantian, was having such guesses in their hearts.

If that person had disguised themselves as a little girl, it wouldn’t matter.

However, if she were truly a little girl, the matter would be extremely serious.

A little child actually possessed the cultivation of a peak Exalted?

There was no such frightening existence in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

If she was from elsewhere, then... with the strength that she possessed, the crowd became fearful just thinking of what sort of power was behind her.

With this, who would dare to provoke her?

“This matter was originally unrelated to you two. If the two of you are to leave right now, I will let you go.”

Even though Wuma Yantian had realized that that rank nine Exalted might be someone extraordinary, he did not reveal the worries in his heart. Instead, his attitude was still so forceful.

“I think you’re mistaken. I’m actually trying to give you a reminder,” Bai Liluo said.

“What is it?” Wuma Yantian asked.

“I’d urge you to not attack. If you are to attack him, this young lady will beat you up so badly that not even your granny will recognize you,” Bai Liluo said.
