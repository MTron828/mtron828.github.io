Chapter 5973: Clash of Formations, the Duel Between Prodigies

Jie Tian and the others, who had been eyeing the formation all this while, noticed Chu Feng moving at a rapid speed. In the blink of an eye, the latter had already left the remnant.

The elders looked nervous and worried.

They could tell from Chu Feng’s fast movement speed that he was in a teleportation formation, and they were worried the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s teleportation formation would take him out of the realm.

“You’re finally out?” Jie Tian was excited.

He had been waiting for this moment for a long time, and he was confident that Chu Feng was trapped like a mouse in a trap. Most remnants’ teleportation formations were only limited to within the realm; they wouldn’t transport the individual out of the realm.

And Jie Tian’s guess was right. The teleportation formation didn’t bring Chu Feng and the others out of the realm.

However, Chu Feng could choose the destination of the teleportation formation, and he selected a location that was further away from the remnant.

When Chu Feng finally stepped out of the teleportation passageway, he saw the Totem Nine Daoists standing in a line, waiting for him. Their grim expressions showed that they had something to say.

Daoist First Dragon stepped forward and asked, “Young hero Chu Feng, there’s something I’d like to clarify with you. Is it true that the nine of us couldn’t have left via the teleportation formation in the remnant, and that we’d have to rely on you bringing us out?”

“That’s right.” Chu Feng nodded. “However, I’d have brought you out of the remnant even if you refused to help me.”

“Young hero Chu Feng, we don’t mean anything by that. We believed that you would have brought us out regardless, but...” Daoist First Dragon revealed a bitter smile. “...it looks like you have saved us again.”

The earlier formation realm was on the verge of destruction, and they would have died if they hadn’t leaft the place in time. Even pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritists would be helpless in that position.

Boom!

The earth suddenly shook, and cracks appeared. These cracks were several thousand meters wide, and lava bubbled like ferocious beasts within.

These cracks were caused by the intense pressure coming from the spirit power enveloping the sky. This spirit power swiftly manifested into a formation net and fell toward Chu Feng and the others.

“A sealing formation. Is this what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has prepared?”

Chu Feng frowned.

He could tell how powerful the sealing formation was. They would have been rendered helpless by the sealing formation if not for Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon shouldering the pressure.

“Don’t worry, young hero Chu Feng. We’ll ensure your safety,” Daoist First Dragon said as he began constructing a formation with Daoist Second Dragon.

The two of them gathered an immense amount of spirit power before abruptly releasing them, creating a force that was no weaker than the falling net.

“Elders, you’ll only reveal yourself if you fight back now. Let’s escape instead,” Chu Feng said.

Daoist First Dragon caught Chu Feng’s drift and hurriedly changed the nature of the formation. The formation enveloped Chu Feng and the others, and they began swiftly moving elsewhere.

They were so fast that it only took an instant for the devastated area to disappear behind them, but soon, they realized that the earth behind them was crumbling too.

The massive net in the sky was pursuing them.

...

In the sealing formation’s formation core, Ling Mouzi and the other experts of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were ready to set off.

As soon as Chu Feng was trapped, they would teleport over to apprehend him.

However, they could tell that Chu Feng was swiftly moving elsewhere. The sealing formation wasn’t able to pin him down.

“This speed... It isn’t a teleportation formation, but Chu Feng shouldn’t be able to move so quickly. Does he have another ace up his sleeves? But what kind of treasure does he have that allows him to move at a speed comparable to a pinnacle True God level cultivator?””

The elders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion frowned, as they sensed that Chu Feng’s speed was abnormal.

“Does Chu Feng have helpers?” one of the elders proposed.

“It is possible. Chu Feng is close to the Immortal Sea Fish Clan,” Ling Mouzi replied.

“It doesn’t matter. He won’t be able to escape,” Jie Tian said. He turned to Ling Mouzi and said, “I’ll leave it to you to capture Chu Feng. I’ll strengthen the formation.”

Jie Tian infused his bloodline power into the formation core.

Ling Mouzi took out a token to channel the sealing formation to pursue Chu Feng.

Under normal circumstances, the sealing formation should have been potent enough to capture Chu Feng even if he was fleeing at a speed comparable to a pinnacle True God level cultivator. However, Jie Tian had used his bloodline power earlier to greatly expand the area of the sealing formation, which resulted in weaknesses in some areas of the sealing formation.

Chu Feng happened to be located in one of the sealing formation’s areas of weakness, which made it more difficult for them to capture Chu Feng.

“Wuu!” Jie Tian suddenly harrumphed. His face was warped in pain.

This was the result of him infusing a huge amount of his bloodline power into the formation core.

Ling Mouzi’s eyes lit up in delight.

Jie Tian was channeling the sealing formation’s energy, which was previously concentrated inside the remnant, outward. With this tremendous amount of energy at their disposal, they would surely be able to capture Chu Feng no matter how fast he was escaping.

This shouldn’t have been an easy feat to pull off, such that even Ling Mouzi wasn’t capable of it. Yet, Jie Tian was pulling it off.

While Jie Tian’s Ruler’s Bloodline did grant him absolute control over this formation, his performance still astounded Ling Mouzi. There was no doubt that Jie Tian was a top-notch prodigy, even if he was second to Chu Feng.

...

Meanwhile, Daoist First Dragon was swiftly escaping from the formation net with Chu Feng and the others, but there was unease in his eyes.

Despite the fast speed he was moving at, the formation net in the sky was still keeping pace. This made him realize that they might not have the strength to deal with the sealing formation even if the Totem Nine Daoists joined forces.

“Big brother, second brother, will we be able to leave this place through an ancient teleportation formation?” Daoist Ninth Dragon asked,

The immense pressure from the formation net in the sky made him sweat profusely even though it hadn’t caught up with him yet. It was hard for a world spiritist of his caliber to withstand the prowess of such a powerful formation.

“The sealing formation has enveloped the entire realm. Unless we can breach it, it’ll be impossible to escape even through ancient teleportation formations,” Daoist Fifth Dragon answered the question.

“Looks like we have no choice but to reveal ourselves.” Daoist First Dragon turned to Chu Feng. “Young hero Chu Feng, the nine of us have already prepared ourselves for the consequences. We don’t mind revealing ourselves.”

Running was not a solution. They had to find a way to breach the sealing formation even if he wasn’t confident about pulling it off. Given the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s foundation, it would only be disadvantageous to them if they dragged it out.

“Please wait a bit longer. I need more time.”

Chu Feng’s hands were clasped together in a unique hand seal. Spirit power was continuously flowing into his palm.

He had been up to something since they started escaping.

The Totem Nine Daoists, as world spiritists, could tell that he was constructing a formation, but they didn’t think that a world spiritist of Chu Feng’s caliber could deal with the present situation.

“Young hero Chu Feng, while you are the one who cleared the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnant, our big brother and second brother are pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritists. They are more adept at dealing with formations of this caliber,” Daoist Fourth Dragon advised.

“I understand, but I don’t want you to have a direct confrontation with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion over me. I just need fifteen minutes.”

Daoist Fourth Dragon wanted to say something else.

“Fourth brother,” Daoist Second Dragon suddenly spoke up and shook his head, a gesture for him to speak no more.

Daoist Fourth Dragon finally shut his mouth.
