Chapter 3203 - Holy Spirit Formation of Light

"Are you all the only newcomers from the Chu Heavenly Clan this year?" Someone from the Puyang Heavenly Clan asked.

Puyang Han and Puyang Qi were only looking on from the sidelines. Although they had questions for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they did not ask them. The reason for that was because they felt that the Chu Heavenly Clansmen before them were simply too weak. They felt that with how weak they were, they were not even qualified to speak to them.

"That’s correct," Chu Qing said. His tone was very good-natured. However, he was not submissive. Instead, he possessed quite a presence.

Chu Qing was, after all, the former number one individual among the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. Not only did Chu Qing possess outstanding talent for martial cultivation, but the way he conducted himself was also quite extraordinary.

Seeing that Chu Qing was acting neither servile nor overbearing before them even though he had such a weak level of cultivation, many of the people present were surprised. They thought to themselves that that Chu Heavenly Clansman was quite different.

"Who are you lying to?! Is that Chu Feng not your Chu Heavenly Clansman?!" Someone from the Puyang Heavenly Clan shouted angrily at Chu Qing.

"Little brother Chu Feng is naturally a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan," Chu Qing replied with a faint smile.

"Enough of your rubbish. Where’s that Chu Feng? Where is he hiding?" That Puyang Heavenly Clansman asked.

"Hiding? What might you mean by that?" Chu Qing asked.

"Humph, that Chu Feng was the first one to enter this New Excellence Formation. However, he has not revealed himself even now. How could you all not know where he’s hiding?" That Puyang Heavenly Clansman asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Indeed, little brother Chu Feng was the first person to enter the New Excellence Formation. However, based on my understanding of him, he isn’t the type to hide around. Besides, there’s no reason for him to hide," Chu Qing said.

"What a ’there’s no reason for him to hide.’ In that case, why don’t you tell me why we are unable to find any sign of your little brother Chu Feng on the first floor, the second floor, the third floor and even the fourth floor. If that little brother Chu Feng of yours didn’t hide, where is he then?" That Puyang Heavenly Clansman asked.

After he finished saying those words, he loudly shouted, "Chu Feng! Stop hiding like a coward! If you’re a man, then show yourself! Allow us to witness exactly what sort of individual you, the son of Chu Xuanyuan, might be!"

"What’s this?! Even after I’ve said it like this, you still do not dare to show yourself?! It turns out that Chu Xuanyuan’s son is actually a spineless coward!"

"Don’t bother shouting anymore. Perhaps my little brother Chu Feng is simply not even here to begin with," Chu Qing said.

"Oh? He’s not here? Why don’t you tell me where is he then?" That Puyang Heavenly Clansman said.

"Perhaps he’s on the fifth floor," Chu Qing said.

"What? You said he’s on the fifth floor?!"

"Are you trying to make me laugh?"

"Hahaha! Everyone, did you all hear this? This trash from the Chu Heavenly Clan actually said that Chu Feng is on the fifth floor!"

Hearing what Chu Qing said, that Puyang Heavenly Clansman not only revealed a mocking look, but he also began to laugh at and ridicule Chu Qing.

At that moment, many others also began to laugh at and ridicule Chu Qing. They all felt what he said to be a ridiculous joke.

The crowd all knew that there were five floors to the New Excellence Formation. Merely, reaching the fourth floor was already extremely difficult. As for the fifth floor, it was simply something that practically no one could find.

If it was said that Chu Feng had entered the fourth floor, then the crowd might reluctantly believe it. However, if Chu Feng was said to have entered the fifth floor, the crowd all felt it to be simply nonsense.

"Buzz~~~"

However, right at that moment, a dazzling light suddenly appeared from deep within the fourth floor.

"What is that?"

The crowd’s expressions all changed upon seeing that light.

At the moment when the crowd were startled by the light, someone had already begun to rapidly fly toward that light. It was Li Anzhi.

Seeing this, Puyang Han and Puyang Qi immediately flew over too.

Following that, everyone present soared into the sky and began to rapidly fly toward the location of the light.

Finally, the crowd all arrived at the location of the light. When the crowd managed to see the light at a close distance, their expressions all changed enormously.

That light was actually a flight of steps that led directly into the sky. However, the flight of steps suddenly broke off in midair.

"That is... the flight of steps leading to the fifth floor?"

"What’s going on? Why would the flight of steps leading to the fifth floor suddenly appear?"

The crowd were all confused.

At that moment, the strongest newcomer from the Dongguo Heavenly Clan spoke, "I’ve heard from my seniors that the New Excellence Formation has a total of five floors. Each floor has tremendous cultivation resources. However, the fifth floor has the most extraordinary cultivation resources."

"Not only is fifth floor the floor that is most densely packed with cultivation resources, but its cultivation resources are also gathered into a special painting. That painting contains martial comprehension that all martial cultivators yearn for in their dreams."

"As the martial comprehension is hidden within that painting, only those with extraordinary talent and outstanding comprehensive ability would be able to obtain enlightenment from it."

"With every portion one comprehends, that painting will get a bit smaller. If someone is capable of comprehending the painting on the wall completely, the painting will disappear completely."

"At that time, all of the steps leading to the other floors of the New Excellence Formation will reveal themselves. All of the obstructions will disappear. Regardless of one’s cultivation and one’s talent, everyone will be able to reach the fifth floor."

"When everyone reaches the fifth floor, the Holy Spirit Beast will be summoned."

"If someone is capable of defeating the Holy Spirit Beast, they will be able to summon the legendary Holy Spirit Formation of Light."

Suddenly, a woman from the crowd said, "Right, I’ve also heard of that. However, according to the rumors, even though the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm has existed for many years, extremely few people were able to reach the fifth floor. As for those among them that were able to summon the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, they’re even rarer. As far as I know, there have only been two people in history that were able to summon the Holy Spirit Formation of Light."

"Who were they?" The crowd asked in unison.

"Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan," that woman said.
