Chapter 3085 - Chu Xuanyuan’s Son

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd’s expressions changed.

It was only at that moment that they realized why Chu Feng was so ruthless toward Li Anzhi.

It turned out that he had done that deliberately. He wanted to teach Li Anzhi a lesson.

As for the reason, it was because Li Anzhi had angered Chu Feng.

At that moment, the crowd realized that Chu Xuanyuan was Chu Feng’s reverse scale.

He was someone that could not be insulted.

......

“Chu Feng, I, Li Anzhi, will remember the humiliation I’ve received today. I will definitely return it to you in double.”

The current Li Anzhi was extremely weak. Even his voice sounded extremely powerless. That said, his voice was filled with killing intent.

To him, what Chu Feng did was also an act of humiliation.

Thus, Li Anzhi currently hated Chu Feng to the bones, and even wanted to kill him.

“Very well. If you want to fight, I, Chu Feng, will accompany you anytime,” Chu Feng said in a very indifferent manner. It was as if he hadn’t placed Li Anzhi in his eyes the entire time.

“Woosh, woosh~~~”

At that moment, two of the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations landed on the battle stage and helped Li Anzhi back onto their war chariot.

Seeing the scene of Li Anzhi being helped back onto the war chariot and then comparing it to Chu Feng standing on the battle stage confidently, waves were surging violently in the crowd’s hearts.

After all, the one that was just defeated by Chu Feng was Li Anzhi of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

“Chu Feng, did you think you’ve won?”

Suddenly, Li Anzhi’s younger brother Li Tianyou looked to Chu Feng with hatred-filled eyes.

“What else could it be? Are you perhaps suggesting that I’ve lost?” Chu Feng asked.

“The battle today was merely a sparring. The actual battle is the battle between your clan and our clan. I’d urge you to prepare yourself for despair.”

Li Tianyou swept his gaze across everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan as he said those words. His gaze was very sharp. Not only was it filled with soaring anger, but it was also extremely threatening.

A member of the younger generation actually dared to threaten the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, Li Tianyou just so happened to succeed.

Once Li Tianyou said those words, he made the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan and the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm realize that the Li Heavenly Clan was already an arrow on a bow, and that a war was unavoidable once the Upper Realm Gate opened completely.

Suddenly, Chu Feng asked, “Li Tianyou, I would like to ask you this: had you all thought of losing to me before coming here today?”

“It was merely a spar, what are you acting so arrogant for? My big brother will definitely repay you for his defeat today,” Li Tianyou said.

“Heh,” Chu Feng chuckled, “Actually, I wish to present you with these words.”

“Today, you all came here without ever imagining that you might lose, because you were filled with confidence.”

“I want to tell you all this. What you all are thinking, what you all are seeing, might not necessarily be the truth.”

“I will advise you of this: return to the Li Heavenly Clan and properly relay my words to your clan’s elders.”

“If your Li Heavenly Clan knows your place, then even if the Upper Realm Gate opens completely, our Chu Heavenly Clan will not bring any harm upon your Li Heavenly Clan.”

“However, if your Li Heavenly Clan thirsts for our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm out of greed and dares to invade our Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory with your army, do not blame our Chu Heavenly Clan for acting ruthlessly,” Chu Feng said.

“Am I mishearing things? You’re threatening me?” Li Tianyou asked.

“That is not a threat. It’s merely a warning. However, if your clan refuses to comply, the warning shall come true,” Chu Feng said.

“Hahaha...” Suddenly, Li Tianyou burst into loud laughter.

Following him, the other Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations also began to laugh.

To them, what Chu Feng said was truly akin to a joke.

Even though Li Anzhi’s defeat by Chu Feng today was very unexpected, they still possessed absolute confidence in their clan.

They felt that the difference between the Chu Heavenly Clan and their Li Heavenly Clan was simply akin to night and day.

They stood high and above, whereas the Chu Heavenly Clan was merely a weak clan.

Yet, a weakling in their eyes dared to threaten them. Naturally, they would find it very laughable.

To them, Chu Feng’s threat was simply akin to a hare declaring that it would bite a tiger to death. It was simply comical and absurd.

“You dare to threaten me? What makes you think you’re capable of that?”

Suddenly, Li Tianyou pointed toward Chu Feng and asked, “What makes you think your Chu Heavenly Clan is capable of threatening our Li Heavenly Clan? Who gave you the courage to utter that threat? Who gave you the confidence?”

The smile on his face had disappeared. It was replaced with endless anger. Being looked down on by Chu Feng caused him, a young master of the Li Heavenly Clan, to feel extremely displeased.

“I’ve already said what I needed to say. If you all refuse to believe my words, I can only say you can all give it a try when the time comes.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng’s eyes became incomparably sharp. His gaze was like an invisible blade piercing through Li Tianyou’s heart.

Seeing Chu Feng’s eyes, Li Tianyou’s body immediately trembled, and he involuntarily took two steps back. He even lost his footing, and nearly fell on his butt.

Even though he also did not understand why, the second his eyes met Chu Feng’s eyes, he actually felt fear. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Tianyou, what’s wrong?”

The Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations hurriedly supported Li Tianyou. Not knowing what had happened, they looked to Li Tianyou with confused expressions.

As for Li Tianyou, he felt extremely embarrassed. Thinking that he was actually frightened by Chu Feng’s gaze, the anger in his heart soared even more.

Thus, he said to Chu Feng in a very fierce manner, “Chu Feng, just you wait.”

After he finished saying those words, Li Tianyou waved his sleeve, turned around and entered the war chariot.

After all of the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations entered the war chariot, the war chariot turned around and began to fly toward where they came from.

The war chariot was very fast. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared into the distant sky.

Seeing the Li Clan’s War Chariot growing further and further away, the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm all felt very uneasy.

They felt that the Li Heavenly Clan’s war banner that was gradually disappearing from their field of view would once again appear. Furthermore, the next time it appeared, it would likely bring a great catastrophe upon the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Chu Feng being able to defeat Li Tianyou was an unexpected pleasant surprise. However, it was not completely out of the question.

After all, Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan’s son. The blood running through him was the same heaven-defying blood.

However, it would be a miracle if the Chu Heavenly Clan was able to defeat the Li Heavenly Clan.

After all, the disparity between the two clans was simply too enormous.

At that moment, many people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were not immersed in joy at having beaten back the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. Instead, they were extremely worried.

“Chu Feng, well said,” suddenly, a voice was heard.

It was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

The crowd were surprised by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s words.

Not only had Chu Feng injured the strongest member of the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generation, but he had even threatened the Li Heavenly Clan. What he did would only increase the Li Heavenly Clan’s hostility toward the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Originally, the crowd had thought that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would reprimand Chu Feng. Even if he didn’t reprimand Chu Feng, he should, at most, consider nothing to have happened.

The crowd truly didn’t expect for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to praise Chu Feng.

Was he being excessively pampering of Chu Feng, or was it really as Chu Feng had said and the Chu Heavenly Clan possessed strength superior to what could be seen, that they were truly certain in being able to defeat the Li Heavenly Clan?

“The reputation of Chu Xuanyuan’s son is truly well-justified.”

At the moment when the crowd was confused, another voice was heard.

When that voice was heard, the crowd’s expressions changed again. The reason for that was because the person who had spoken was the Saintly Stellar Monk.
