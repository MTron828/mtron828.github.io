Chapter 3962 - Who Is This Guy?

Originally, the All-heaven Sect was totally capable of opening the treasure secretly. There was simply no need for them to invite all those people.

The reason why they invited so many people over was because they had absolute confidence that they would be able to obtain the treasure.

After observing the All-heaven Sect’s disciples, Chu Feng discovered that Nangong Yifan was not only filled with confidence, but his body also seemed to be rather abnormal. He was emitting a special sort of aura.

Because of that, Chu Feng started carefully observing Nangong Yifan with his Heaven’s Eyes.

After carefully observing Nangong Yifan, Chu Feng discovered that he was actually emitting the same sort of aura as the stone case.

“This All-heaven Sect is truly despicable.”

At that moment, Chu Feng realized why Nangong Yifan was so confident.

When the six powers obtained that treasure, the other five powers each took a key. The five keys were needed to open the stone case.

As for the All-heaven Sect, they were given the task of safeguarding the stone case.

However, the All-heaven Sect was not only simply safeguarding the stone case. They’d begun to think of all sorts of methods to peer into the stone case’s power. They wanted to gain a decisive opportunity from the stone case.

And it seemed like they’d succeeded. Even though Chu Feng had no idea as to exactly what sort of power they’d obtained, the aura of the stone case on Nangong Yifan proved their success.

“Everyone, listen carefully. We still do not know what sorts of dangers are present in that spirit formation world. You all will only be able to find out once you’ve entered.”

“Your mission is to retrieve the treasure hidden in the spirit formation world.”

“However, as treasures are limited, struggles will be unavoidable. That said, whilst fighting over the treasure is allowed, battles must be stopped when the outcome has been determined. One cannot take the life, cripple the cultivation or even seriously injure one’s opponent.”

“If anyone dares to violate that rule, regardless of which power he belongs to, we, the six great powers, will jointly punish that person.”

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster spoke with a loud and clear voice. His voice was extremely imposing, and filled with a sense of warning.

The people of the younger generation responded in unison. They expressed their desire to comply with the rule. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Apart from that, there is one most important thing. You all can see the pattern on the mirror map, correct?”

“That pattern is a countdown. You all only have twenty hours.”

“Once twenty hours pass, all of you will be kicked out of the spirit formation world.”

The All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster pointed to the shrinking pattern above.

“So that’s actually a countdown?”

“This spirit formation world actually has a time limit?”

Many people present felt shocked upon hearing those words.

However, the people from the six great powers, including their disciples of the younger generation, did not react with much surprise.

Evidently, they already knew that the spirit formation world had a time limit.

“It is now time. You all will be teleported into that spirit formation world.”

“I must now remind you of this important matter. The spirit formation world can only be opened once. You only have this one opportunity.”

“To be exact, you only have twenty hours. As such, all of you are tasked with a heavy responsibility.”

“Success or failure will all be determined by yourselves.”

“Go on, complete your mission. Regardless of who it might be that will obtain the legendary treasure, they shall be the pride of our six great powers.”

Once the All-heaven Sect’s sectmaster finished saying those words, the disciples of the six great powers immediately set off, and began flying towards the spirit formation world.

However, as there were only five entrances, two of the powers inevitably had to enter the same entrance.

The two powers that had to enter the same entrance were the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain.

At that moment, two rows of disciples had walked to the same place.

When the disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain looked to each other, hostility filled their eyes.

Chu Feng had learned of the reason for their hostility.

The matter must be mentioned from what had happened not long ago.

The six great powers were allies. Thus, cooperation was a common thing amongst them.

Not long ago, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Seven Stars Heavenly Mountain had cooperated to breach a remnant. In that cooperation, disagreement arose.

An elder from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect had injured an elder of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain. Furthermore, it was reported that the injury was very serious.

This matter had long spread through both powers.

As the disciples gathered to participate in the grand occasion were all outstanding talents and filled with pride, arrogance and youthful vigor, they’d long made the resolve, and even secretly planned to teach their opposing disciples a lesson to avenge their respective elders.

[1. What’s there to avenge for the Wind Lightning Sword Sect when your elder is the one that seriously injured the other elder?]

“This junior sister here is truly refined. Once we enter the spirit formation world, there will be a lot of dangers. Junior sister, you should follow your senior brother. I will protect you.”

Before even entering the spirit formation, a male disciple from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain cast his gaze to the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s Bai Lulu.

Although his words sounded pleasant, the tone he spoke with clearly indicated that he was trying to harass her.

However, it just so happened that the person who’d said those words was not an ordinary disciple.

His name was Song Jinglun. He was a rank two Exalted, and the strongest disciple of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain.

“Song Jinglun, the junior brothers and sisters of my Wind Lightning Sword Sect do not need your protection. You should instead concern yourself with the people of your Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain,” said Ouyang Pingzhi.

“I am speaking with that junior sister, since when were you qualified to butt into my conversation? Who did you think you are?”

Song Jinglun said those words very quietly. Yet, as the disciples from the two powers had already assembled at the same place, his voice, albeit quiet, was clearly heard by the disciples.

Because of this, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s disciples all revealed looks of anger.

To be met with such provocative words from Song Jinglun, Ouyang Pingzhi would naturally not allow himself to be outdone.

“Song Jinglun, insults using words are of no interest. Why don’t we measure ourselves against each other after we enter that spirit formation world?” said Ouyang Pingzhi.

“And what if I insist on using my mouth to insult you? What are you going to do? If you’re capable, why don’t you try attacking me now?”

“Fucking coward. You don’t dare, no? The way I see it, you’re trash that only knows how to use your mouth,” Song Jinglun said with a mocking expression as he looked to Ouyang Pingzhi.

Ouyang Pingzhi’s face was covered in anger after being provoked repeatedly by Song Jinglun.

That said, he knew that Song Jinglun was trying to deliberately provoke him.

If they were to fight inside the spirit formation world, it would be pardonable. However, if he were to attempt to attack Song Jinglun out there, it would become a personal grudge, and a laughing stock for others.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke. Not only that, his tone was also very ill-intended, “Are you going to enter or not? If not, then move aside and stop wasting my time.”

“Sssss~~~”

Chu Feng’s voice was very loud. This caused the two rows of disciples to look towards him.

In fact, many gazes atop the viewing platform also landed on Chu Feng.

However, when they saw him, the crowd all felt extremely surprised.

At that moment, the same thought emerged in the minds of many people -- ‘Who is this guy? He actually dared to speak in such a manner?’
