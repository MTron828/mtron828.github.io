Chapter 2905 - Selling Immortal Armaments

The Immortal Archery Bow was originally a nameless weapon. No one knew who had created it or where it came from.

However, as it was a weapon used by Exalted Archer, people started calling the bow the Immortal Archery Bow.

Although no one knew the origin of the Immortal Archery Bow, its quality was definitely not something that could be looked down on. It was most definitely a peerless work of art among Immortal Armaments.

With Exalted Archer’s extraordinary archery skills, the power of the Immortal Archery Bow was unleashed to its peak. Thus, the reputation of the Immortal Archery Bow was even more resounding in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm than the Nine Phoenix Immortal Edge.

That said, the Immortal Archery Bow had disappeared with Exalted Archer. No one knew of its whereabouts. As such, it was classified as a legendary Immortal Armament that existed only in stories from the people of the older generation, as well as the stories about Exalted Archer.

That said, no one would’ve expected the Immortal Archery Bow to be obtained by Chu Feng after disappearing from the world for so long.

Chu Feng firmly believed that if he were to take the Immortal Archery Bow out and auction it, he would definitely cause a massive commotion. In fact, the impact would surpass that of the sensational Nine Phoenix Immortal Edge that the Ghost Sect Hall was auctioning.

That said, Chu Feng was someone who would one day become a Heavenly Immortal. At that time, he would need a powerful Immortal Armament. As such, Chu Feng would naturally not auction off the Immortal Archery Bow. Instead, he was going to keep it for his own personal use.

That said, with such an Immortal Armament in hand, how could Chu Feng be interested in that Nine Phoenix Immortal Edge?

That said, Chu Feng was quite interested in the other truly sensational treasure that was going to be auctioned this time around.

That truly sensational treasure was called the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.

Reportedly, there are only eight Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagrams in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. No one knew who their creator was.

In the past, six Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagrams had appeared.

All six of those Spirit Beast Treasure Diagrams recorded a mysterious place that no one had ever discovered before. Contained inside those mysterious places were legendary mysterious treasures.

The Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram that was being auctioned off in the Ghost Sect Hall this time around was the seventh Spirit Beast Mysterious Diagram. Thus, its appearance would definitely cause a huge commotion, and cause various parties to bid wildly for it.

That being said, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master also let Chu Feng know that not all world spiritists were capable of opening the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagrams. If one wanted to open a Spirit Beast Mysterious Diagram, they would have to be brought together by fate.

Unfated individuals might not be able to open the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram in their entire lifetime, whereas fated individuals might be able to unlock the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram right after obtaining it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Unfortunately, the previous owner of the seventh Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was not a fated individual. He had held the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram for many years, but was unable to open it. That was also the reason why the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was being auctioned.

That said, Chu Feng was looking forward to something like that greatly. After all, opportunities would oftentimes accompany mysterious places.

Thus, Chu Feng asked, “Senior, what is the starting bid for that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram?”

“Little friend Chu Feng, you couldn’t possibly be interested in the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, right?” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall master asked.

“This junior is indeed interested in it,” Chu Feng said.

“Little friend Chu Feng, truth be told, the current owner of the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram has already spread the news that it will be auctioned here. Many people have come to this Grand Auction Assembly precisely for the sake of the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.”

“Furthermore, it could be said that many of them have come prepared.”

“The starting bid for the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram is actually not that high. It is only a million Immortal Martial Stones.”

“That being said, I feel that its final winning bid might be around ten million Immortal Martial Stones,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“Around ten million Immortal martial Stones? In other words, it is equivalent to a thousand Immortal Armaments?” Chu Feng asked.

“If one were to weight it using ordinary Immortal Armaments, then that is indeed the case,” The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“In that case, senior, what is the price of that Nine Phoenix Immortal Edge?” Chu Feng asked.

“Even if the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram can be opened, even if one is able to find the mysterious place recorded on it, no one is certain what sort of treasure is contained in that mysterious place. Thus, the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram possesses a certain amount of uncertainty to it.”

“As for the Nine Phoenix Immortal Edge, it is completely genuine. If one were to successfully win it through the auction, one would obtain that absolute gem of an Immortal Armament.”

“Thus, the starting bid for the Nine Phoenix Immortal Edge is ten million Immortal Martial Stones. With my experience, the final winning bid should be around fifteen million Immortal Martial Stones,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“In that case, senior, how much do you think this Immortal Armament of mine is worth?”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a silver spear from his Cosmos Sack.

In addition to the Immortal Archery Bow, Chu Feng had also obtained a lot of extraordinary Immortal Armaments from the Exalted Archer’s Tomb. That spear was one of the Immortal Armaments.

“Little friend Chu Feng, this Immortal Armament of yours is a rarely seen top quality Immortal Armament. Although it cannot be said to be an absolute gem, it is absolutely not something that ordinary Immortal Armaments could compare with,” Old Man Gui Chou said.

“Indeed, it is a rarely seen top quality Immortal Armament,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master echoed.

“In that case, Senior Hall Master, what sort of price do you think I could auction this Immortal Armament for?” Chu Feng asked.

“If you are to auction it, then you will be able to auction it for around a million Immortal Martial Stones if you’re lucky. Even if you’re unlucky, you should still be able auction it for five hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones at minimum,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“In that case, senior, would it be possible for me to exchange some Immortal Martial Stones with you?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng had heard from Elder Xingyi that the Ghost Sect Hall was not only in charge of auctioning goods and receiving commissions, but they would also purchase goods directly. Merely, their price would be slightly less than the auction price.

Chu Feng wanted to bid on that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.

However, while Chu Feng had obtained a lot of treasures from Exalted Archer’s Tomb, there weren’t any Immortal Martial Stones.

Thus, Chu Feng wanted to trade some Immortal Martial Stones for his Immortal Armaments so that he could participate in the auction.

“Of course. Little friend Chu Feng, if you want to exchange your Immortal Armaments for Immortal Martial Stones, I am willing to pay six hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones for an Immortal Armament of that quality,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“You merely need Immortal Armaments of this quality for six hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones?” Chu Feng asked.

“Mn, any number of Immortal Armament would do,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“Senior, I will trouble you then,” as Chu Feng spoke, he took out twenty-nine top quality Immortal Armaments.

At that moment, it was not only Old Man Gui Chou who revealed an astonished expression. Even the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master was thoroughly surprised.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you are truly well-hidden. You actually have so many top quality Immortal Armaments on you.”

“One should know that this number of top quality Immortal Armaments is something that many powers do not possess,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“Senior, am I able to exchange them?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, of course. Each Immortal Armament would be six hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones. A total of thirty top quality Immortal Armaments would be eighteen million Immortal Martial Stones. Gui Chou, go and retrieve the Immortal Martial Stones,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

“Yes, milord,” Old Man Gui Chou said. He immediately turned around and left. Not long afterward, he returned.

When he returned, he had a Cosmos Sack in his hand. There were precisely eighteen million Immortal Martial Stones in the Cosmos Sack.

“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng put the eighteen million Immortal Martial Stones away.
