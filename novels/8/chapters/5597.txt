Chapter 5597: I Don’t Want to Keep My Distance

Chu Feng and Little Fishy made their way toward where Long Xiaoxiao was.

He had told Little Fishy that he was going to look for a friend and asked her if she wanted to meet Long Xiaoxiao together with him. Little Fishy said that she would accompany him there, but she wouldn’t show herself before Long Xiaoxiao. Instead, she would wait for him elsewhere.

Chu Feng still wanted to study the metal can, so he had Little Fishy lead the way while he carefully examined it. To his relief, the metal can’s puzzle didn’t change, so he was able to quickly decipher the first two locks to arrive at the third one.

With his prior experience, he was able to quickly compose himself to study the third lock. Unfortunately, the third lock was so complicated that it was hard for him to figure anything out on the spot even with his Heaven’s Eyes activated. On top of that, the invisible aura was starting to get to him as time passed, so he was forced to avert his eyes.

Just as he turned his eyes away from the metal can, he saw that Little Fishy had halted her footsteps. She was squatting in front of him with her hands propping up her chin, her eyes staring at him.

“What’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked, sensing a hint of reluctance in her eyes.

“Nothing’s wrong. Did you figure anything out?” Little Fishy asked.

“It’s tougher than I thought. I’ll need to experiment a few more times to figure it out,” Chu Feng replied.

“I’m sure you’ll be able to do it,” Little Fishy cheered for him.

“Are you really fine?” Chu Feng asked.

“…No, it’s not fine. My family members have come looking for me,” Little Fishy replied.

“Do they want you to return right away?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know. I’ll have to negotiate with them. Big brother, will you wait here for me for a while?” Little Fishy asked.

“Of course,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

He wanted to accompany Little Fishy over, but her words hinted that her family members were in the vicinity. The fact that her family members had chosen not to show themselves right away meant that they didn’t want to meet him.

He would only be baggage by insisting on tagging along.

“I’ll be right back,” Little Fishy said with a sweet smile before heading off.

Chu Feng looked in the direction Little Fishy had left. At this point, he had already lost the mood to examine the metal can.

“Don’t worry, she’ll be fine. They are her family members, after all,” Eggy said.

.

“I know. I’m just getting a little emotional,” Chu Feng replied.

“Emotional over what?” Eggy asked.

“Back when I was in the Eastern Sea Region, those giant hands that tore open the sky made me feel truly insignificant for the first time. While there’s still a huge gap between us, it isn’t as big as it used to be anymore,” Chu Feng said.

“Of course. You made huge advancements over the years! It won’t be long before you overtake them. By then, they won’t stop you from hanging out with Little Fishy anymore,” Eggy said.

“Why?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why? They don’t want Little Fishy to associate with you because they think that you’re weak. The moment you surpass them, they’ll do everything they can to fawn on you, let alone stop you from associating yourself with Little Fishy,” Eggy said.

Chu Feng chuckled at those words. He had to concede that there was some sense to what Eggy said, as this was simply a matter of practical concern. It was normal for powers to treat one differently when one was weak as compared to when one was strong. He had encountered such situations far too many times.

Many times he had been oppressed by powerful organizations in his journey. Looking back, those powers had become ants he could obliterate with a wave of his hand. Even a sneeze from him now would have been cataclysmic to them.

Yet, those were towering mountains blocking his path back then, suppressing him so much that he could hardly catch a breather.

The mountains currently standing before him, be it ally or foe, were the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, and the other galaxy overlords. Right now, he didn’t have any say before them at all.

“I have to become stronger. I need to continue becoming stronger,” Chu Feng thought to himself.

Meanwhile, Little Fishy had ascended above the clouds, where a middle-aged woman was waiting for her.

The middle-aged woman was dressed in a simple white robe, but her transcendental disposition made her seem like a fairy descending upon the world. Time had left its marks on her face, but her ethereal beauty still drew eyes.

“Mother, you’re out of closed-door training!” Little Fishy ran up to the middle-aged woman with a sweet smile.

The middle-aged woman was none other than Little Fishy and Xianhai Shaoyu’s mother.

“Your father assigned me a mission as soon as I’m out of closed-door training,” Little Fishy’s mother said with a smile.

“Surely it isn’t to have you look for me?” Little Fishy muttered with a pout.

“What do you think?”

“I’m not returning. Father told me that he’d grant me my freedom once I reach Exalted level, but he’s still restricting my freedom even though I have already reached Half-God level. I can only head to places he permits with a huge army of guards accompanying me. I haven’t slacked off in my martial cultivation at all, and I am capable of protecting myself. Am I unworthy of the same freedom as my big brother? Mother, I… am not happy at all,” Little Fishy grumbled with tearful eyes.

“Yu’er, I know that your father’s arrangement has taken a toll on you, and it isn’t fair to heap so much on a child’s shoulders, but you are a smart child. You know the high hopes your father has for you. Furthermore, something huge happened while you were in the Immemorial Star Sea. A gate has manifested from the sculpture that commenced God’s Era.

“Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster, Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master, and your father worked together to open that gate and entered the area,” Little Fishy’s mother said.

“What happened?” Little Fishy asked out of curiosity.

“Your father learned that there is a never-before fortuitous encounter awaiting us in God’s Era, but those who wish to acquire this fortuitous encounter will first have to be crowned king in the world of cultivation. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master has long harbored such ambitions,” Little Fishy’s mother said.

“Does the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion intend to break the many years of peace and wage war?” Little Fishy asked.

“The strength of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion isn’t as simple as it appears on the surface. Should a war break out, there’s no guarantee that we would be able to triumph over them even if we form an alliance with the other galaxy overlords. Furthermore, there are bound to be some who would side with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

“To put it bluntly, the only way we can remain safe should a war break out is for us to submit to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but you also know your father’s temper,” Little Fishy’s mother said.

“I wouldn’t agree to it either. Why should we submit to them?” Little Fishy harrumphed.

“That’s why you have to return with me. There is still hope, and it lies with you juniors. The greatest hope of our Immortal Sea Fish Clan is none other than you, Yu’er,” Little Fishy’s mother said.

Little Fishy frowned as she lowered her head. Soon, she raised her head to look at her mother once more and said, “I’ll return, but you mustn’t restrict my freedom anymore once we settle this matter.”

“Should that day ever come, I doubt if your father would even be able to stop you anymore,” Little Fishy’s mother said.

“That day would definitely come,” Little Fishy said with a chuckle.

Little Fishy’s mother widened her smile. She looked in Chu Feng’s direction and asked, “Are you going to bid him farewell?”

“Of course. Mother, do you want to tag along? I’ll introduce you to him,” Little Fishy said.

“It isn’t time yet,” Little Fishy’s mother said.

“All right. Wait for me,” Little Fishy said as she quickly returned to Chu Feng’s side.

“How is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“Big brother, I’ll be leaving,” Little Fishy replied.

“Did your family member reprimand you?”

“They didn’t. My family says that they need me, and they persuaded me to return. I’m doing this of my own volition.”

“Go ahead and return home. We’ll meet again when you’re free.”

“All right.” Little Fishy suddenly took a step forward to embrace Chu Feng, only to stop right in front of him. She raised her head to look at him and said, “Big brother, men and women ought to keep a distance between them.”

Chu Feng chuckled upon hearing those words. He wanted to say something, but he suddenly felt a soft sensation pressing against him.

Little Fishy was tightly embracing Chu Feng, burying her beautiful face into his chest.

“But I don’t want to keep a distance with big brother,” Little Fishy said as if declaring her ownership over him. She twisted and turned her face in his chest before finally stepping back. “Big brother, you have to work hard. This world needs us. I’ll come and look for you very soon!”

With those words, Little Fishy turned around and left the area.

Even though Chu Feng had already mentally prepared himself for it, he still felt a sense of emptiness as she left. He couldn’t bear to see her leave.
