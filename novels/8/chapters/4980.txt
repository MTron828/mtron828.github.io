Chapter 4980: Song Yun’s Warning

“You!!!”&nbsp;

Qiu Long turned to look at Chu Feng, but the disdain in his eyes had been replaced with fright. He was not just frightened because the lecherous man had been killed in one blow but that Chu Feng had revealed his cultivation.&nbsp;

Rank three Martial Exalted level. That was Chu Feng’s current cultivation level.

On the other hand, Qiu Long was only at rank one Martial Exalted level. How could he fight someone so much more powerful than him?

“Chu Feng, your cultivation…”

Song Feifei and the others could sense Chu Feng’s cultivation as well, but their faces reflected their surprise and relief. They were surprised because they didn’t think that Chu Feng would be that powerful, and they were relieved because they knew that they were saved.&nbsp;

“Miss Song, I’ll have to trouble you to bring the others out of here first. What’s going to happen next isn’t suited for your eyes,” Chu Feng said.&nbsp;

He flung his sleeves, and the tightly shut doors of the palace opened up.

“Be careful, Chu Feng.”

Song Feifei knew that Chu Feng was intending to teach these fellows a lesson they would never forget, so she quickly got up and led her sisters out of the palace. Before leaving, she didn’t forget to direct a hateful glare at Qiu Long and the others.&nbsp;

The despaired look on their faces made her feel slightly liberated.&nbsp;

Right after they walked out, the doors to the palace closed up.

Gah!

Cries of agony ensued.

They were from Qiu Long and the others. It didn’t take long for them to turn into pleas for mercy.&nbsp;

However, it was futile. The cries of agony continued. Chu Feng didn’t spare them just because they had surrendered.&nbsp;

One of Lady of Dao Sea’s disciples was curious, so she used her means to peer into the palace. Chu Feng had closed the doors, but he didn’t seal off the palace with his spirit power. Thus, others were able to see what was happening within with their spirit power if they wanted to.&nbsp;

Uweh!

She turned around and barfed the next moment.

“You… What’s wrong?”

Song Feifei and the others rushed forward and asked out of concern.

“Don’t… look inside… no matter what happens!”&nbsp;

She pointed at the palace with a ghastly pale face and warned Song Feifei and the others. Song Feifei frowned upon hearing those words, and the other female disciples quickly turned their eyes away from the palace even though they weren’t able to look through the walls normally.&nbsp;

The female disciple who had peeked into the palace earlier was one of the bravest amongst them, having slain innumerable savage beasts. While they were still children, many of them had broken down into tears while slaying a savage beast for their first time. Yet, this female disciple showed no fear. On the contrary, she was excited by the spilling of blood.&nbsp;

Many incidents afterward proved that the female disciple was indeed a little bloodthirsty.

Yet, even someone like her was reacting in such a manner.

This showed the extent of cruelty that was happening inside the palace.

Finally, the cries of agony came to a halt.

The doors to the palace opened, but the expected outpour of blood stench didn’t come. There was only Chu Feng, who nonchalantly walked out of the palace.

“You should take the two fallen comrades inside with you. We should be leaving this place soon,” Chu Feng told Song Feifei.&nbsp;

Shoosh!

After saying those words, Chu Feng rose into the air and headed toward the sky, where Song Xue’er was fighting against the elders of the Starspecter Valley.

Song Feifei and the others were initially hesitant to look into the palace, fearing to see something nauseating. However, they couldn’t just leave the bodies of their two deceased sisters inside.&nbsp;

Song Feifei eventually mustered the courage to walk into the palace, only to find that there was nothing else other than the bodies of their two deceased sisters. There was no trace of Qiu Long and the others at all. In fact, they couldn’t even spot a droplet of blood.

They were certain that they saw Chu Feng decapitate a person’s head earlier, causing blood to splatter everywhere. The female disciple from earlier on was also certain of the cruelty she had witnessed inside.&nbsp;

It was only at this moment that they understood why they couldn’t smell the stench of blood when the doors opened. Chu Feng must have known that the bloodshed would have left them feeling queasy, so he cleaned up the place in advance.&nbsp;

“I never thought that he would be this meticulous. It’s no wonder why even Lele feels so strongly for him.”

The female disciples present felt a surge of warmth in their hearts. Instead of rushing to collect their comrades’ bodies, they turned their eyes toward the sky to look at Chu Feng.&nbsp;

“How did Chu Feng get so powerful? Isn’t he only at mid-Utmost Exalted level? How did he grow so strong within such a short period of time?”

“Was he hiding this cultivation all this while?”

“That’s incredible. He’s probably the strongest junior in the eastern region with his current level of power.”

The female disciples remarked in awe.

They couldn’t actually see the battle in the sky at all as it was on a higher level than what they could perceive, but they were still able to fathom a guess about how it was going from Chu Feng’s aura.&nbsp;

Chu Feng’s participation had changed the situation. Those elders from the Starspecter Valley were going to die.&nbsp;

All of the female disciples whom Chu Feng felt something rippling in their hearts, including Song Feifei. There was a slight change in their gaze.&nbsp; ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

In this world where the strong reigned supreme, it was reassuring to have a strong man to fall nack on, and Chu Feng was such a person. Before they knew it, they were already seeing Chu Feng as a hero who would swoop to their rescue whenever they were in trouble.&nbsp;

“Hey, the seniors over there, just a word of advice.”

A young woman’s voice suddenly sounded behind them. The female disciples quickly turned around and saw that it was Song Yun.&nbsp;

Song Yun was sitting on the city walls opposite the palace. She was munching on an apple while shaking her fair legs, reminiscent of a mischievous child. It was just that the words she uttered next sent a chill down their spines.&nbsp;

“You shouldn’t fall for my big brother Chu Feng. Otherwise, you might just lose your lives.”

Song Yun’s eyes curled into adorable crescents as she spoke with the sweetest of smiles.&nbsp;

Yet, the female disciples froze up. They could sense intense killing intent coming from Song Yun. Furthermore, she had spoken the latter half of her words through voice transmission so as to ensure that others wouldn’t be able to overhear it.

She wasn’t just joking around. It was a real warning!
