Chapter 3100 - Xian Miaomiao Left

“Father, master, seniors, brothers and sisters, it’s been a long time. How has everyone been doing?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s voice sounded. His voice was even louder than thunder as it spread through the surroundings.

Not to mention the people that weren’t training, even those on top of the volcano that were immersed in training were startled by Chu Feng’s voice.

The sudden voice startled many people.

One must know that there were rules in that place. One could not shout or make loud noises, as it would disturb others. If one dared to violate the rules, one would forever be driven out..

For someone to suddenly shout so loudly and disturb everyone present, the people there subconsciously felt that the person who shouted was doomed.

Taking joy in the calamity of another, the crowd turned their gazes in Chu Feng’s direction.

They wanted to see exactly who it was that dared to act so reckless, who it was that would be driven out of the sacred cultivation ground.

“That is?”

However, when the crowd’s eyes turned to Chu Feng, many gazes immediately turned emotional.

The next moment, people started to descend from the sky and fly toward Chu Feng.

Familiar faces began to appear around Chu Feng.

Chu Feng’s adoptive father Chu Yuan, Chu Feng’s older cousin Chu Yue, Chu Feng’s adoptive brother Chu Guyu, the Azure Dragon School’s Azure Dragon Founder, the previous headmaster Li Changqing, Chu Feng’s master Zhuge Liuyun, Chu Feng’s sworn brother Monstrous Monkey King, Qiu Canfeng, Huangfu Haoyue, Dugu Xingfeng, Bai Ruochen, Tantai Xue and other familiar faces all surrounded Chu Feng.

They were all feeling extremely excited as they tightly surrounded Chu Feng.

“Feng’er, is it really you? Father is not seeing things, right? You’ve returned?”

“It’s Chu Feng, there’s no mistake. That boy is Chu Feng. Haha, Chu Feng, you’ve returned.”

“My little brother, you’ve left for the Outer World, yet you still remembered to come back to see your big brother Monkey? How’s the Outer World?”

“Chu Feng, how did you get back?”

All sorts of voices could be heard nonstop. There were voices of concern, voices of inquiry and, above all, voices of surprise.

Chu Feng’s return truly served as a pleasant surprise to them.

At that moment, everyone had heard Chu Feng’s name. Those that were training stopped their training, and those that were resting stopped resting.

Vast groups of people, densely packed like a gathering of humanoid locusts, began to cover the sky as they flew down to crowd around Chu Feng.

They were so excited. It was as if they all knew Chu Feng.

No, they knew Chu Feng. Of course they knew Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng was the person who had saved the entire Holy Land of Martialism in the past.

Furthermore, it had only been several years since Chu Feng had saved their Holy Land of Martialism. As such, how could they not know Chu Feng?

In fact, it would not even be excessive to say that Chu Feng was a savior to everyone present.

After all, he had truly saved their lives.

That was the reason why the crowd was so excited.

Unanimously, the crowd came to a decision to stop their training and arrange a banquet to celebrate Chu Feng’s return.

The banquet was prepared just as it was decided. Furthermore, it was a massive banquet with tens of millions of participants.

Beside the volcano, under the blue sky, firelight covered the vast earth. Those were lights from the massive banquet, and people that covered the entire place.

Voices of laughter, excitement and people toasting could be heard all around.

Such a scene was simply much more spectacular than the scene of everyone surrounding the volcano to train.

The crowd were all enjoying the feast. It seemed that it was not only because they were joyous from Chu Feng’s return. It appeared that they had not celebrated like that way in a long time now.

Chu Feng had practically seen all the people that he wanted to see again at the banquet.

There were only three people that he did not see.

They were Zhang Tianyi, Jiang Wushang and Xian Miaomiao.

Chu Feng had heard that Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang’s talents were beginning to emerge.

Thus, they were able to enter locations that others could not, and were training deep in the volcano.

Training in there, they would not be able to hear the voices from outside. Furthermore, apart from the two of them, the other people were all incapable of entering the volcano.

Because of that, they could only wait for them to finish their training and come out on their own.

“Seniors, in that case, where’s Miaomiao? Did Miaomiao also enter the depths of the volcano?” Chu Feng asked curiously. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Young Master Chu Feng, Miaomiao has already left,” a beautiful woman said to Chu Feng.

That woman was very beautiful. She could be said to be an exceptional beauty. The reason for that was because she was not a human. Rather, she was a beauty of the Ancient Era’s Elf Clan.

That woman was the eldest princess of the Elf Kingdom, Xian Miaomiao’s older sister, Xian Lingyue.

“Left? Could it be that Miaomiao has left for the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?” Chu Feng’s heart sunk upon hearing those words.

Chu Feng had told Xian Miaomiao on the day he left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm that she must contact him once she arrived at the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

However, Chu Feng did not receive any contact from Xian Miaomiao when he was still in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Chu Feng even went as far as to deliberately look into Xian Miaomiao out of fear that she did not contact him after arriving in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Unfortunately, he never managed to find Xian Miaomiao in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Judging from things now, it was very possibly that Xian Miaomiao left for the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm after Chu Feng had left it.

“We don’t know where Miaomiao left to. That’s because Miaomiao didn’t leave by herself. Rather, she was escorted away by her mother’s clansmen,” Xian Lingyue said.

“By her mother’s clansmen?” Chu Feng’s expression changed upon hearing those words.

Xian Miaomiao’s mother was no ordinary character. She was a powerful existence that had nine lives.

As for Xian Miaomiao’s mother’s clansmen, they were likely also people that had that same sort of special bloodline as Xian Miaomiao’s mother.

“Had they mentioned where they were going?” Chu Feng asked.

“They did not. Miaomiao was forcibly brought away by those people,” when mentioning the matter, Xian Lingyue sighed.

At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that everyone from the Elf Kingdom revealed a helpless and ashamed expression on their faces.

Likely, none of them had desired for Xian Miaomiao to be forcibly taken away.

Merely, they were powerless to do anything against the powerful clansmen of Xian Miaomiao’s mother.

“In that case, did they ever mention which clan they belonged to?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng was certain that the clan that Xian Miaomiao’s mother belonged to was not from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm or the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. In fact, Chu Feng could not even be certain if their clan was from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

If Chu Feng wanted to find Xian Miaomiao, he had to know the name of their clan. Otherwise, with how vast the Outer World was, it would not be an easy task to find her.
