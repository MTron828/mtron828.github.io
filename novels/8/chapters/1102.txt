MGA: Chapter 1103 - Dragon and Phoenix Dancing in the Skies

“Sectmaster Zhou, you mean to say?” At this moment, Sikong Zhaixing was immensely happy.

“My ancestor’s words cannot be disobeyed. Back then, our ancestor said that as long as someone from your Southern Cyanwood Forest is capable of obtaining the keepsake from the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda, our Ascension Sect would be in an alliance with your Southern Cyanwood Forest, and live and die alongside it, sharing everything.”

“According to the words left by our ancestor, what little friend Chu Feng obtained was precisely the keepsake from the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda. Hence, from today, our Ascension Sect shall be a part of your Southern Cyanwood Forest and your Southern Cyanwood Forest will also be a part of our Ascension Sect. As long as the Ascension Sect exist, the Southern Cyanwood Forest will also exist.”

“Very well. From today hence, our Southern Cyanwood Forest will exist and perish alongside the Ascension Sect, sharing everything.” Hearing those words, Sikong Zhaixing repeatedly nodded his head.

He was able to sense the sincerity of the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster; they truly wanted to ally themselves with his Southern Cyanwood Forest. As for this, it was precisely what he had wished and hoped for. It was also the purpose for his coming this time around. And now, for this to actually happen, he would naturally be extremely overjoyed.

“Headmaster Sikong, there is actually another reason why I brought you two here today. I wish to have little friend Chu Feng help me with a matter,” said the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“Oh? Sectmaster Zhou, what might it be that you need help with?” asked Sikong Zhaixing.

“Senior sectmaster, if there is anything you need, feel free to ask away.” Chu Feng also spoke.

“Regarding this, I would have to explain from the beginning.” As the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster said those words, he placed his hand onto his Cosmos Sack. As his Cosmos Sack flickered with light, a spirit formation key appeared in his hand.

This spirit formation key was very similar in appearance to the one that Chu Feng obtained. Other than a slight difference, it was simply identical.

Most importantly, these two spirit formation keys emitted the same sort of aura. It meant that the two of them ought to have been created by a single person and were both extraordinary items.

“Actually, back then, it was not only your Southern Cyanwood Forest’s ancestor, Senior Baili, who gave your Southern Cyanwood Forest a difficult problem to solve, our Ascension Sect’s ancestor also gave our Ascension Sect a difficult problem to solve.”

“Although our Ascension Sect is currently not lacking in Mortal Taboo Martial Skills, they were all Martial Skills that our Ascension Sect’s seniors obtained themselves; none of them were related to our ancestor.”

“Thus, back then, our Ascension Sect’s ancestor did not leave behind his techniques to our Ascension Sect. At the very least, he did not pass on his special Martial Skills to us. Instead, he had placed them in a special place.”

“As for the place that stored our ancestor’s Martial Skills, it is this place.” The Ascension Sect’s sectmaster said.

“Here?” Sikong Zhaixing was surprised. He was not surprised because this was the place where the Ascension Sect’s ancestor’s special Martial Skills were stored. Instead, he was surprised that the Ascension Sect’s ancestor had actually not passed his methods on to the Ascension Sect.

However, even with that being the case, the Ascension Sect still managed to become greatly developed. At the very least, it was many times stronger than his own Southern Cyanwood Forest. This shocked him, as it meant that it was not only because their ancestor Baili Xuankong did not leave his techniques to them that their Southern Cyanwood Forest had reached such a desolate state; it was also because they, the successive generations, were too weak.

It turned out that the true reason why their Southern Cyanwood Forest had deteriorated so far was because of themselves. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That’s right. This is the place. Hidden in this place are the Taboo Martial Skills left behind by my ancestor. Not only are there Mortal Taboo Martial Skills, there is also an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill,” said the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“Earthen Taboo Martial Skill?”

Hearing those words, Sikong Zhaixing was once again surprised. In the Holy Land of Martialism, Mortal Taboo Martial Skills were relatively numerous. However, Earthen Taboo Martial Skills were much rarer. At the very least, for powers like themselves, while they could train in Mortal Taboo Martial Skills, they did not currently have any Earthen Taboo Martial Skills to train in.

Even if someone managed to obtain an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill, they would generally obtain those from some sort of ancient era’s remnants. For Martial Skills like those, they would generally be limited to be used only by the person who obtained it, and were unable to be passed on to others.

Thus, there were very few places within the Southern Cyanwood Domain that possessed Earthen Taboo Martial Skills to train in. Other than the colossal Cyanwood Mountain, there were not many powers that possessed Earthen Taboo Martial Skills.

If the Ascension Sect were to obtain an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill that they could allow their disciples to train in, their reputation would definitely be much more resounding.

“Headmaster Sikong, have you ever heard before that our sect’s ancestor and senior Baili knew of a kind of fusion Martial Skill?”

“That Martial Skill is extremely valiant, and possessed the power to bring about destruction to the heavens and the earth. Even ordinary Earthen Taboo Martial Skills would be no match before it.”

“Although it is a Martial Skill that cannot be used alone, as long as two individuals are present, they would be able to activate it. Furthermore, as long as it could be activated, practically nothing and no one would be able to stop its path. Using this Martial Skill, our ancestor’s names have resounded throughout the entire Cyanwood Domain,” said the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“That is something that I have heard of too. It is said that that Martial Skill is a special technique belonging to the two of them. It is also the reason why they were seen by the world as the best of friends.” Sikong Zhaixing nodded.

“In the words left behind by my ancestor, he said that the special fusion Martial Skill that he and senior Baili grasped is hidden in this place. As for that, it is the Earthen Taboo Martial Skill that I have mentioned,” said the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“What? That fusion Martial Skill is actually still in existence?” Upon hearing those words, shock was written all over Sikong Zhaixing’s face. Even though he had only heard about the fusion Martial Skill, he knew that the fusion Martial Skill was Baili Xuankong and the Ascension Sect’s ancestor’s supreme skill. Other than the two of them, there was simply no one else who knew about this fusion Martial Skill.

It was precisely because the fusion Martial Skill was extremely powerful and was used by fusing their martial powers, it led to the fusion Martial Skill to be practically unrivalled among the Earthen Taboo Martial Skills. It was this reason that led to many people feeling pity because it failed to be passed on.

Yet now, the fusion Martial Skill that their ancestors had grasped was actually still in existence. This meant that the exceptional Martial Skill that everyone thought to be lost was actually still in existence. How could Sikong Zhaixing not be excited for this?

However, after thinking about it, he felt a bit desolate. Although this fusion martial skill’s fame was widespread, it was something shared by his Southern Cyanwood Forest’s ancestor and the Ascension Sect’s ancestor. Yet now, it was in the possession of the Ascension Sect. This inevitably caused him to feel a bit of jealousy for the Ascension Sect’s good luck.

If it was to be said that a single Earthen Taboo Martial Skill would be able to cause the Ascension Sect’s reputation to resound even greater, then this fusion Martial Skill would definitely be able to resound the name of the Ascension Sect throughout the entire Cyanwood Domain, and bring about countless outstanding younger generations that wanted to join the ranks of the Ascension Sect. With this, the Ascension Sect’s power would rise abruptly.

“According to the words left behind by my ancestor, the fusion Martial Skill is indeed still in existence, and is located in this place. Furthermore, that fusion Martial Skill possessed a name that few people knew - Dragon and Phoenix Dancing in the Skies,” said the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster with a great amount of certainty.

“Dragon and Phoenix Dancing in the Skies, this is truly a great name,” praised Sikong Zhaixing with admiration.

“Dragon and Phoenix Dancing in the Skies is not a Martial Skill that anyone could train in. Only heavenly geniuses like our ancestors are capable of learning it successfully. Furthermore, it required two people to know this fusion Martial Skill in order for it to be used.”

“In our entire Ascension Sect, and your Southern Cyanwood Forest, I believe only my daughter, Bai Ruochen, and little friend Chu Feng, possess the potential required to learn this Martial Skill. Therefore, I wish that the two of them learn this Dragon and Phoenix Dancing in the Skies together,” said the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“Truly?” Hearing those words, Sikong Zhaixing was immediately overjoyed. That was because the Dragon and Phoenix Dancing in the Skies was no small matter. If Chu Feng was able to learn it, it would definitely be an extremely joyous occasion. That was because not only does the Dragon and Phoenix Dancing in the Skies possess extraordinary power, it also signified a kind of inheritance, the inheritance from their Southern Cyanwood Forest’s ancestor.

“Of course,” The Ascension Sect’s sectmaster gently stroked his beard and nodded. However, after that, he laughed and said, “However, before that, we would still need to obtain my ancestor’s remains. This is what I wanted little friend Chu Feng to help me with.”
