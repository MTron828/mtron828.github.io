Chapter 2011 - Only You

Today, these tigers must be released. Even though they were unwilling to do so, they had no choice but to release them.

As Chu Feng had pulled out the fierce tigers’ sharp teeth, the crowd felt a whole new level of respect for him.

However, at the moment when all the grand characters were praising him, Chu Feng was unable to smile at all. Standing high in the sky, he looked to his surroundings.

He looked to the people with broken arms, broken legs, mutilated bodies or open wounds. Looking at them, Chu Feng felt as if his heart was bleeding.

These people didn’t have to be injured. They were injured and left in this state all because of the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace.

However, when compared to those who had died in this battle, these people who were only injured were extremely fortunate.

“Even though I have managed to obtain compensation and pulled out the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s sharp teeth, I am unable to bring those who died back to life. I am unable to comfort their relatives through the pain of losing their loved ones.”

“If I had the choice, I would definitely personally avenge them, and kill all those from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace that came to invade us today.”

“Unfortunately, I am incompetent...”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he flew down from the sky and began to help heal the injured.

At that moment, the crowd was completely startled. The word ‘incompetent,’ caused their hearts to twitch.

Seeing Chu Feng saving the crowd, seeing him letting go of his status and healing even the unremarkable Martial Kings, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, Immeasurable Immortal, Snow-haired Immortal and the others looked to one another.

Then, one by one, they descended to the surface and began to help heal the people injured in the battle.

Actually, healing the injured from a battle was not something that they, the grand characters, should be doing. Merely, as Chu Feng was doing so, they could not find any reason not do so with him.

Afterwards, Chu Feng invited everyone to a feast. However, the crowd from the Cyanwood Mountain did not immediately start to celebrate.

Instead, under Chu Feng’s guidance, they first attended a memorial service for those who had died in this battle. In fact, Chu Feng was simply in no mood to celebrate.

However, it remained that they had obtained a great victory. As such, he could not appear to be spiritless. For the sake of boosting the crowd’s morale, the Cyanwood Mountain not only invited the outsiders to a feast, they themselves also hosted a feast.

With the experts from the Underworld Palace, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Four Great Imperial Clans, they jointly celebrated their victory in this battle.

“Little friend Chu Feng, these Imperial Armaments are too precious. We cannot accept them.” At the feast, the King Monstrous Dragon Race’s Clan Chief tried to hand the two Imperial Armaments and the many Incomplete Imperial Armaments to Chu Feng.

“Lord Clan Chief, for you all to have come here to assist us today, I, Chu Feng, am truly grateful. I do not know how to thank you all. As such, those are things that you all deserve, that you all should keep.”

Chu Feng would naturally not accept the Imperial Armaments and Incomplete Imperial Armaments. While the people from the Cyanwood Mountain did not deserve to die, this was even more the case for the people from the Underworld Palace, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Four Great Imperial Clans.

They had suffered casualties in order to assist Chu Feng. Thus, Chu Feng was determined to hand those Imperial Armaments and Incomplete Imperial Armaments to them. Only by doing that would Chu Feng feel a bit more at ease.

“Everyone, let’s stop with this back and forth. I have a proposal,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master said.

“Lord Palace Master, what sort of proposal might you have?” The Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder asked.

“If we are to try to hand all of the Imperial Armaments and Incomplete Imperial Armaments to little friend Chu Feng, he would definitely refuse. But, we can each hand an Imperial Armament and twenty Incomplete Imperial Armaments to the Cyanwood Mountain.”

“Like this, we would be enjoying the profits together.”

“Little friend Chu Feng, you must not refuse this. We came to help you out of camaraderie. There is no need to consider compensation in such a case.”

“As for the reason why we are returning a portion of the Imperial Armaments and Incomplete Imperial Armaments, it is not because we find it difficult to accept them. Rather, it is because we want to share the profits. We were able to seize total victory this time around mainly because of you. As such, you should naturally receive a share of the gains from this battle,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master said.

“What Lord Palace Master says is very correct. Little friend Chu Feng, you must not refuse this,” The King Monstrous Dragon Race’s Clan Chief said.

“That’s right. Little friend Chu Feng, you must accept them. If we cannot even share the gains from a battle, how are we an alliance?” The Four Great Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders added.

They spoke those words willingly. The reason for that was because they had not sent a lot of troops to assist Chu Feng in this battle. As such, if they were to take away that many Imperial Armaments, they would feel distressed about it. However, it would be different if they were to share a portion of their profits with Chu Feng.

“Very well. Since everyone insists, I, Chu Feng, will also not refuse it anymore. We managed to win this battle today all because of you all. As such, in the future, we shall share both our prosperity and our difficulties,” Chu Feng raised his wine cup.

The crowd raised their wine cups in response. Merrily, they shared a cup of wine.

“Little friend Chu Feng, I have another gift that I wish to present you. You must accept it,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master said.

“Palace Master, what is it that you wish to gift me?” Chu feng asked with a smile.

“You will definitely be interested in this gift,” As the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master spoke, he took out an item from his Cosmos Sack. It was a cube-shaped box that emitted flickering light. It was a spirit formation.

Upon seeing that spirit formation, Chu Feng’s eyes immediately shone. Contained within that spirit formation was a secret skill.

To be exact, it was one of the Five Elements Secret Skills, the Earth Immortal Profound Technique!!!

“This gift is too precious. I absolutely cannot accept it,” Upon seeing the Earth Immortal Profound Technique, Chu Feng felt as if his blood was boiling.

Currently, he had already obtained the Fire Immortal Profound Technique and Water Immortal Profound Technique. Although he had yet to grasp the Gold Immortal Profound Technique and Wood Immortal Profound Technique, they remained in his possession. If he were to obtain the Earth Immortal Profound Technique too, he would have obtained all five of the Five Elements Secret Skills.

If Chu Feng were to grasp all five of the Five Elements Secret Skills, he would be able to obtain the treasure left behind by the Five Elements Old Ancestor.

No one knew exactly what that treasure was. However, as it was a treasure, Chu Feng naturally wanted to obtain it.

Merely, it was one thing to obtain the two secret skills from the Mortal King Palace and the Heavenly Law Palace. But, as for the Underworld Palace, they did not owe him anything. As such, Chu Feng found it improper to accept the Earth Immortal Profound Technique, an extremely precious treasure.

“Little friend Chu Feng, I have wanted to become allies with the Cyanwood Mountain for a long time now. Today, this Earth Immortal Profound Technique shall be used to express my good faith. I hope that little friend Chu Feng will accept it,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master seemed to know that Chu Feng would be reluctant to accept the Earth Immortal Profound Technique. Thus, he gave a reason to make Chu Feng accept it.

“If it wasn’t for senior’s prompt arrival with the Underworld Palace’s army, our Cyanwood Mountain would truly have been in imminent peril. From that moment, we were already allies.”

“Since we are allies, there is no need for this. Senior, please take back the Earth Immortal Profound Technique. I will not accept it,” Chu Feng still found it difficult to accept the Earth Immortal Profound Technique.

“Little friend Chu Feng, this is my sincerity. If you are to refuse to accept it, you would be refusing my request to become allies,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master said.

At that moment, Lord Lianghua also added, “Chu Feng, the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master only possesses good intentions. You should just accept it.”

“What Lord Lianghua says is correct,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master smiled and nodded.

“Little friend Chu Feng, the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master is already saying it like that. Thus, you should stop refusing it.”

Following that, many of the people present all began to urge Chu Feng to accept the Earth Immortal Profound Technique. They were able to tell that the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master truly wanted to gift that secret skill to Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng smiled and shook his head. Even though he deeply wanted the Earth Immortal Profound Technique, he did not plan to accept it. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Little friend Chu Feng, I will tell you the truth today. Although this Earth Immortal Profound Technique has been with our Underworld Palace for many years, our Underworld Palace is simply unable to unleash its full strength.”

“I believe everyone knows of the strength of the Five Elements Secret Skills. When they are unleashed, they come out as a body with a cultivation one level higher than that of their owner.”

“However, the people that are truly capable of accomplishing that feat are extremely few. Over the tens of thousands of years, only six individuals have been capable of accomplishing that feat. And now, in the Holy Land of Martialism, only little friend Chu Feng is capable of it,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master said.

“Only me?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was startled.

“Of course. Otherwise, why would Duanmu Feiyu and Xun Fengyang, those two fellows, not use the secret skills when they possessed them?” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master said.
