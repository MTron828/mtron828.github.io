“Actually, I have a suggestion. I don’t know if it’ll work, but it’s worth a try,” Chu Feng said.

“What is it?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“I’ll construct a formation to bind the four of us together. It might lead us into the same illusory formation instead of fighting by ourselves,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, I still want to try it myself,” Sansheng Xingyu said.

“Me too,” Sansheng Qiutian agreed.

“You sustained severe injuries this time. It’s a warning. If you fail again, you might either lose your life or be eliminated altogether,” Chu Feng said.

Both Sansheng Xingyu and Sansheng Qiutian were stunned. Neither outcome was acceptable to them.

“We’ll fail too if you fail,” Chu Feng added.

“What should we do then?” Sansheng Qiutian panicked.

He didn’t want to fail, let alone drag down Chu Feng and Zi Ling.

“Let’s try my method. If it fails, you can still try to clear the trial on your own,” Chu Feng said.

“All right, we’ll listen to your arrangement,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

Sansheng Xingyu nodded in agreement.

Chu Feng quickly treated their injuries before constructing a formation with a wave of his hand. The formation enveloped all four of them.

Chu Feng didn’t tell them the truth. Using this formation wasn’t a solution from him but a tip he had deciphered from observing the surroundings. As a matter of fact, the formation he had just constructed to bind them together had come from this place.

He didn’t tell them the truth as this formation would be much more difficult compared to them entering by themselves, and he was worried that Sansheng Xingyu and Sansheng Qiutian might refuse to go along with it.

His plan was to clear the illusory formation all by himself after binding the four of them together.

A person simultaneously taking on four people’s worth of trials was extremely dangerous, but Chu Feng was confident of pulling it off.

“Is that all?” Sansheng Qiutian was surprised when he saw how fast Chu Feng constructed his formation.

“Yes, that’s all. I’m just giving it a try; whether it’ll work or not is another matter. Anyway, we have nothing to lose,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s true.” Sansheng Qiutian smiled.

“Let’s go,” Chu Feng said.

He descended the stairs once more, but this time, he didn’t need the other three to make any mental preparations. Due to the formation, the other three would automatically be dragged into the illusory formation if he made a move.

Their surroundings changed as soon as he stepped onto the second floor.

Sansheng Qiutian and the others found themselves on a battlefield. Both the sky and the earth were dark red due to the fresh blood splattered all around. An overwhelming stench of blood assaulted their noses.

Sansheng Qiutian felt dizzy and nauseated. Sansheng Xingyu was forced to cover her nose.

The two of them had participated in all kinds of trials, and such battlefields were commonplace. However, they knew that those were fakes, and they were mentally prepared for it. In contrast, the sight before them right now looked incredibly real.

“Where is this?” Sansheng Qiutian shouted in agitation.

Chu Feng realized that Sansheng Qiutian didn’t know they were in an illusory formation, so he formed a hand seal and enveloped Sansheng Qiutian and Sansheng Xingyu in his spirit power.

Soon, the two of them regained their rationality and remembered that they had come here with Chu Feng to breach a formation. Everything around them was fake.

“Chu Feng, did we succeed?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“That’s right.” Chu Feng nodded.

“What do we do next?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“Kill everyone who appears,” Chu Feng replied.

“All right, I can finally make a move now. I’ll let this disgusting illusory formation know how powerful I am!” Sansheng Qiutian tried to roll up his sleeves and get ready for a huge fight, only to be shocked. “Chu Feng, why can’t I move?”

He wanted to make his way toward Chu Feng, but he realized he was unable to move at all.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I can’t move as well. What’s going on?” Zi Ling stared at Chu Feng in shock.

“Don’t worry. Leave it all to me,” Chu Feng replied.

“Something is off. Are you hiding something from us?” Zi Ling asked with a frown.

“Yes. I didn’t want you to feel burdened, and I was worried you wouldn’t agree too.” Chu Feng proceeded to tell them the truth.

“You’re going to deal with the illusory formation all on your own?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“That’s right, but you don’t have to worry. I can do it myself,” Chu Feng replied.

“I don’t mind, but... Are you sure you’re fine on your own?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“Yes, I’m fine on my own,” Chu Feng promised.

Boom!

The earth shook, and countless silhouettes appeared in the distance. There were both humans and monstrous beasts, but most of them were Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen.

The humans and monstrous beasts were all familiar faces to Chu Feng and Zi Ling. Similarly, the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen were familiar faces to Sansheng Qiutian and Sansheng Xingyu.

“Why does this illusory formation look so lifelike?” Sansheng Qiutian asked with a pale face.

He knew that this was all fake, but it was so lifelike that it put him in a dilemma. He felt like there were two voices in his mind, one telling him that this was all fake, and the other telling him there was a chance that this might just be real.

These two voices confused him, making it hard for him to muster his determination, let alone kill these people. It was difficult for him just to see these people getting killed.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already charged straight into the army. He activated his formations, and countless formation swords manifested out of thin air and rained down on the enemies.

Fresh blood splattered all over the ground. Chu Feng had begun his massacre.

Sansheng Qiutian trembled.

It was one thing to see the foreigners getting killed, but it was another thing to see his fellow Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen being slaughtered, especially the ones on close terms with him!

Despite knowing it was fake, he still struggled to come to terms with it. He was glad that Chu Feng was the one making a move, for he wouldn’t have been able to do it himself.

“Are you all right?” Zi Ling asked, having noticed Sansheng Qiutian’s unusual condition. “You can choose not to watch. Chu Feng can deal with it on his own accord.”

“I’m not afraid of embarrassment.” Sansheng Qiutian realized that Zi Ling had seen through his cowardice.

“Have you never experienced slaughter?” Zi Ling asked.

“Not yet,” Sansheng Qiutian replied.

“You’ll eventually get used to it. Don’t worry about it.”

“Was that the case for you?”

“Indeed, but I think big brother Chu Feng adapted right away.”

“... “ Sansheng Qiutian was speechless. Is there such a huge gap between us?

“Are there people whom Brother Chu Feng knows in there?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“There are, but it’s not a problem. They are all fake,” Zi Ling replied.

Sansheng Qiutian’s eyes turned grim. Sansheng Xingyu looked conflicted.

The two of them knew that they couldn’t do it if they were in Chu Feng’s place. Despite knowing this was all fake, those were still lifelike copies of people whom they knew. They couldn’t bring themselves to kill someone who looked like their close friends and kin.

In contrast, Chu Feng was perfectly fine with it. He unhesitatingly massacred everyone in his path. It was one thing if he only targeted the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen, since those people were strangers to him.

However, those humans were his friends.

Many of them were even calling out his name, using intimate addresses like ‘big brother’, ‘little brother’, ‘Feng’er’, and so on. They were trying to stoke his emotions so that Chu Feng wouldn’t kill them, thus foiling his attempt to breach the formation.

However, it was futile. Anyone who got close to him was killed without mercy.

Sansheng Qiutian thought that Chu Feng resembled an emotionless beast who had no feelings and knew nothing but murder at this moment.
