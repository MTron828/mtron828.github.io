Chapter 5469: This Monster!

Even Long Chengyu was worried for Long Suqing after hearing her awful words. No one could stop Long Xu if he decided to teach Long Suqing a lesson here.

Much to everyone’s surprise, Long Xu didn’t lose his temper despite being clearly angered by Long Suqing’s words. He was holding himself back!

“Suqing, why did you become so unruly after leaving the Totem Dragon Clan? You should never forget that you are a Totem Dragon Clansman! Look at yourself! Can you honestly say that you have the clan’s best interests at heart now? Muxi is still young and doesn’t know how to get her priorities straight, but you should be more mature than that!” Long Xu said.

“All I know is that Muxi must return to our Totem Dragon Clan. That is also what my brother wishes for. It took us so much effort to convince Muxi to return here. If our efforts go down the dragon because of you, you can be sure that I’ll go after you regardless of how lofty or justified you are!” Long Suqing roared.

Long Xu’s face turned even more awful. It looked like he was going to blow his top.

“Lord Long Xu.”

Just then, an elder dressed in a special robe appeared from a hall behind Long Xu.

“Who allowed you in here? Get out!” Long Xu roared, causing the entire palace to shake.

The elder fell to the ground, but he quickly pushed himself up and kneeled on the ground. He sent a voice transmission to the raging Long Xu, and the content of his message brought about a subtle change to Long Xu’s expression.

“Speak,” Long Xu ordered.

The elder opened up his palm, releasing a wisp of light that flew toward Long Xu. Long Xu fused the wisp of light into his mind. Moments later, he widened his eyes in surprise.

He first dismissed the elder with a wave of his hand before turning to Long Suqing.

“Suqing, I know that you care deeply for Muxi. I have also watched Muxi grow up, and I have high hopes for her too. But neither our clan chief nor Chengyu did anything wrong for that matter. It was much more painful for them to come to that decision. Yet, Muxi refused to think rationally and blamed them. Outstanding prodigies are emerging from all of the galaxies, and the current balance of power is being shaken. Yet, Muxi is still throwing a tantrum right now.

“It’s not that I don’t understand the importance of getting on good terms with prodigies, but things are different this time around. Only one true ruler will emerge in our world of cultivation. It’ll be extremely dangerous if that one true ruler isn’t from our Totem Dragon Clan. If that ruler has a kind heart, it’s not out of the question for us to lower our heads and serve them. However, if that ruler has a vicious heart, all of the current powerhouses who might pose a threat could be erased from the face of the world,” Long Xu said.

Long Suqing and Long Chengyu’s faces turned grim.

“Lord Long Xu, are you saying that war is inevitable?” Long Kuitian asked.

“Yes, there will be a war among the galaxies, and the day is drawing close,” Long Xu said.

“This…”

Long Kuitian visibly panicked. Long Suqing also looked worried.

They knew that Long Xu wouldn’t crack such a joke. A war of such scale would surely unleash unprecedented devastation upon the entire world of cultivation. Many would die, including those from the Totem Dragon Clan.

“Lord Long Xu, that’s more reason for us to win Chu Feng over. A God Armament might be valuable, but it wouldn’t change the fate of our Totem Dragon Clan. In contrast, if Chu Feng becomes a powerhouse, he’ll be a trustworthy ally for our clan. I can guarantee his character. As long as we reach out to him with sincerity, he won’t turn his back on us,” Long Chengyu said.

“Eyy. Since that’s the case, I’ll gamble on it once,” Long Xu said.

Both Long Chengyu and Long Kuitian’s faces lit up in delight. They quickly bowed and thanked him. However, Long Suqing still looked a little reluctant to give in.

“Suqing, aren’t you going to apologize to Lord Long Xu?” Long Kuitian urged.

“Forget it. That’s how she is. There are no outsiders here, so I’ll just pretend to have not heard those words.” Long Xu then turned to Long Chengyu and said, “Chengyu, even though I have allowed Chu Feng to enter the Armory Hall, you mustn’t travel with him. You understand what I am saying, right?”

“I know. Father has specially picked out three God Armaments each for big sister and me. He placed them in the side hall of the Armory Hall, which is why we have devoted our resources toward activating the side hall’s formation this time around. In contrast, the main hall’s formation only plays an auxiliary role,” Long Chengyu said before suddenly changing his tone.

“But Lord Long Xu, there are six God Armaments inside the side hall anyway. It isn’t a big deal for Chu Feng to tag along with us.”

“Putting aside how valuable the six God Armaments are, the side hall can only house two people at once. Should a third person enter, the chances of taming a God Armament will be greatly reduced. Chengyu, you are the young master of our Totem Dragon Clan. You carry a heavy burden on your shoulders. You should know how much resources our Totem Dragon Clan has expended to open the Armory Hall…” Long Xu said.

“Enough, I get it. Let’s do that,” Long Chengyu interjected.

“If you don’t have anything up, you should head over to the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted. Chu Feng and Long Muxi are there. Long Yuhong and her mother are there too,” Long Xu said.

Upon hearing those words, Long Chengyu’s face turned cold. He quickly turned around and left the place. Long Suqing did the same as well.

In the blink of an eye, Long Xu and Long Kuitian were the only ones left in the palace.

“You should take a look too,” Long Xu said.

“Lord Long Xu, I'll stay out of this matter. Long Yuhong and her mother won’t be able to take advantage of Miss Muxi anyway with young master Chengyu and Suqing around,” Long Kuitian said.

“Who says that I’m worried about Muxi getting taken advantage of? Do you still not know Chengyu and Suqing’s tempers? It’s one thing if Long Yuhong and her mother rein themselves in, but I fear that they won’t live past today if they dare to disrespect Muxi,” Long Xu said.

Long Kuitian’s face turned pale as it dawned on him that there was a huge possibility of that happening.

“I’ll head over right now.”

Long Kuitian quickly took his leave, leaving Long Xu alone in the palace.

Long Xu waved his hand. The door behind him opened up, and the elder dressed in a special robe walked in once more.

“Are you certain that the formation to open the Armory Hall reacted after Chu Feng’s arrival?” Long Xu asked.

“Yes. There was previously a problem with the formation that prevented us from opening the Armory Hall, but that problem has suddenly been resolved. From the looks of it, we are highly confident that this has something to do with Chu Feng. Furthermore, the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted has opened its eyes for him and emanated a golden light,” the elder said.

Long Xu looked a little conflicted.

“Just what kind of monster has emerged from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” Long Xu remarked with a frown. He wasn’t sure whether this was a blessing or a disaster for them.
