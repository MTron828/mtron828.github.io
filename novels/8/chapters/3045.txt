Chapter 3045 - Special Power

The formation that Chu Youyuan was setting up was a grand unsealing formation.

Chu Youyuan was trying to open a gap so that they could enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground.

Unfortunately, after Chu Youyuan finished setting up his spirit formation, he was simply unable to open that incorporeal barrier.

However, he did not give up. He continued to set up multiple formations.

Unfortunately, no matter what sort of formation he set up, they were all unable to breach the Elf Clan’s Sacred Grounds’ barrier.

Faced with the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground, even a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist like Chu Youyuan was powerless.

Feeling helpless, Chu Youyuan turned to ask Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, “How did the two of you exit that Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground?”

“Senior, the two of us were originally at the valley floor. The valley floor was very large. Furthermore, we were unable to fly and our powers were restricted. Thus, we traveled for a very long time before crawling out from the valley floor.”

“After we crawled out of the valley floor, we began to proceed outward. We did not encounter any barrier or any special passage or tunnel.”

“Merely, as we continued to walk, our surroundings started to change. We found ourselves on this plain. When we turned around, we were unable to see that ravine anymore.”

“When we attempted to return to the ravine, we were also unable to do so,” Ying Mingchao said.

“The two of you really shouldn’t have come out,” Chu Youyuan sighed, and felt pity for Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi.

The reason for that was because he knew that it was truly too difficult to enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground. Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were so fortunate to have entered it. Yet, the two of them decided to come out on their own. This was truly a pity.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, Zi Xunyi passed through that mirror-like formation and began to walk toward the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground. Furthermore, she had managed to directly pass through that formless barrier. She had managed to enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground.

“Xunyi, how did you manage to do that?” Seeing this scene, Chu Youyuan’s expression changed greatly.

It was not only Chu Youyuan; both Ying Mingchao and Chu Feng were also very surprised.

All those formations Chu Youyuan had set up had been ineffective. Thus, how did Zi Xunyi manage to enter it?

“I simply walked in,” ZI Xunyi said.

“Simply walked in?” Hearing those words, Chu Youyuan and the others were surprised. They all felt this to be unbelievable. Then, they all revealed joyous expressions.

They thought to themselves, ‘Perhaps Chu Youyuan’s formations ended up being effective?’

“Senior, let me give it a try,” Ying Mingchao walked over. He wanted to test out whether Chu Youyuan’s formations had ended up being effective.

When he tried, he too managed to walk directly into the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground. He was not stopped by any power.

“Senior, it is effective! The formations you’ve set up are effective! You’ve managed to breach the barrier! We are able to enter now!”

“Senior, Chu Feng, quickly, come on in and enjoy how abundant the natural energies here are!” Ying Mingchao was extremely excited. He waved his hand at Chu Feng and Chu Youyuan to indicate to them to come in.

Seeing this, Chu Feng also revealed a joyous expression, and began to proceed toward Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi.

“Buzz~~~”

Chu Feng felt as if he had passed through a spirit formation gate. On one side of the spirit formation gate was the plain. On the other side of the spirit formation gate was the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground.

Chu Feng also managed to enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground.

“We’re actually really able to enter it?” Seeing this, a smile covered Chu Youyuan’s aged face. Not only was he happy, but he also had a slightly complacent expression on his face.

After all, the barrier that so many people had failed to breach was actually breached by him. With this, how could he not be proud of himself?

With the smile on his face, Chu Youyuan also began to walk toward the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground.

“Bang~~~”

However, when Chu Youyuan walked over, he reacted as if he had encountered a wall, and was knocked back.

“What is going on?” Seeing that Chu Youyuan was unable to enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground, Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were all very puzzled. Chu Youyuan himself was also very confused.

Chu Youyuan attempted to enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground again. However, like before, he was still unable to pass through that formless barrier.

The place that Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi had easily passed through was actually impenetratable to Chu Youyuan.

“Mingchao, come out for a bit,” Chu Youyuan said to Ying Mingchao.

Hearing that, Ying Mingchao immediately walked out.

“Try entering it again,” Chu Youyuan said.

Ying Mingchao immediately turned around and began to walk toward the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground. He managed to smoothly enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground again.

“This...”

At that moment, all four of them were stunned. Confusion filling their eyes.

“It would appear that only this old man is unable to enter it,” Chu Youyuan sighed.

“But... why would this be the case?”

“Even if the two seniors are able to enter, what about me? Why am I also able to enter?”

Chu Feng was very confused. Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were able to enter that place to begin with. Thus, it was reasonable for them to be able to pass through the barrier.

However, this was the first time that Chu Feng had ever been to that place. Yet, he was also able to pass through the barrier. This was truly puzzling.

“It would appear that it is related to that Stairway to Heaven’s vortexes.”

“It’s as I expected. Over the years, many people have encountered the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground, but were unable to enter it. Thus, how could you all be able to enter it so easily?” Chu Youyuan said with a faint smile on his face.

At that moment, Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi also understood what Chu Youyuan meant by that.

They were able to enter that place not because of Chu Youyuan’s formations. Chu Youyuan simply did not manage to breach the barrier. Else, he would not have been stopped by the barrier.

The reason why Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were able to enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground was because the three of them were special.

As for their special-ness, it was very likely because of the Stairway to Heaven’s vortexes. Those vortexes might have bestowed some sort of undetectable special power upon them. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

It was because of that special power that the three of them were able to enter the Elf Clan’s Sacred Ground.

“Should we attempt some other methods?” Chu Feng said.

“No, forget about it. Over the years, people have attempted all sorts of methods. Yet, they were all unable to enter it. No matter how much I try, it will be useless in the end.”

“Chu Feng, do not worry about this old man. Since you’ve entered it, go and check the place out.”

“However, remember to place safety before everything else. If you discover anything amiss, come out immediately,” Chu Youyuan said.

“Okay. Senior, please wait a moment. This junior will come out quickly,” Chu Feng said.

Afterwards, Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi began to wander around the ravine.

The natural energies in the ravine were truly abundant. The scenery there was also very beautiful.

However, it did not resemble a place that a powerful race had lived in before.

The reason for that was because there were no signs of constructions or previous habitation anywhere. It simply did not resemble a place where humans had resided before, much less a place where an extremely powerful race like the Abyss Elf Clan resided before.

That said, the natural energies there were very abundant. Even Chu Feng was amazed by how abundant the natural energies here there. Unfortunately, for someone like Chu Feng, pure natural energies no longer provided much assistance in making progress in his cultivation.
