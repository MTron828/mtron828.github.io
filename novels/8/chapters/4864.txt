Chapter 4864: Shengguang Jiahao

“Chu Feng, you succeeded?” Long Xiaoxiao asked excitedly, though she already knew the answer to the question.

Chu Feng nodded in response before saying, “Xiaoxiao, Shengguang Xuanye wanted you to marry a trash in the Holy Light Clan to humiliate you. Since he wants to be shameless, we’ll play along with him! But this time around, the one who is going to be humiliated isn’t you but Shengguang Xuanye and the entire Holy Light Clan!”

“Alright, let’s stir a pandemonium in the Holy Light Clan!” Long Xiaoxiao exclaimed excitedly.

Even Long Xiaoxiao’s mother also revealed a rare smile.

She knew that Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao were going to do something dangerous, but after all of the injustices they had suffered, nothing could placate their anger anymore other than the destruction of the Holy Light Clan.

So, she chose to give them their full support.

But all of a sudden, Chu Feng suddenly stared into the distance.

“Chu Feng, what are you looking at?”

Long Xiaoxiao walked over to Chu Feng’s side, knowing that something must have caught his eye. However, she wasn’t able to see anything at all.

“I see your future husband,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re referring to Shengguang Jiahao? The Holy Light Clan is here?”

Long Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but frown out of nervousness. Despite her high morale just a moment ago, she still felt an innate fear toward the Holy Light Clan. It looked like the latter had left a deep trauma on her.

“Follow me.”

Chu Feng concealed Long Xiaoxiao and her mother with a formation before approaching the group from the Holy Light Clan.

Those from the Holy Light Clan dressed differently from usual, donning auspicious red robes. No doubt, they were indeed the group who were here to fetch Long Xiaoxiao.

It was just that the group was different from what Long Xiaoxiao and her mother envisioned.

“The goddamned Holy Light Clan! They are clearly trying to humiliate our Xiaoxiao!”

Even someone as cultured as Long Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but cuss upon seeing the group dispatched by the Holy Light Clan.

Despite being the overseers of the Holy Light Clan, they only sent thirty or so people over to the Dragon Clan to fetch Long Xiaoxiao. One must know that someone of Long Xiaoxiao’s standing would have usually been welcomed by an army of ten thousand at the very least for her marriage!

This showed just how much the Holy Light Clan belittled her.

On top of that, there were no carriages or war chariots at all, just a mere simple sedan.

It was truly unseemly.

And what was the most infuriating was the person standing at the forefront of the group. There, a man was riding on a flying red horse. The flying red horse had a dashing appearance that ironically only served to contrast against the man’s hideous looks.

The man was horrifyingly ugly.

It was a fatty with a nose shaped like an onion. His eyes were slanted, and saliva was dripping out of his mouth. His skin was rough like sandpaper, and there were bumps all over it.

Even a fly wouldn’t want to land on his face out of fear of scraping its legs.

He couldn’t even maintain his balance on the horse, requiring another servant to hold him up.

But the servant just had to be a maid. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

It was hard to tell whether he was doing it intentionally or not, but his hands were moving around the maid’s body, touching her sensitive parts. The maid didn’t appear to be angered by his gesture either, possibly already used to it.

The others from the Holy Light Clan would direct contemptuous gazes at him from time to time. Even his own clan members couldn’t stand the sight of him.

From this, it could be seen just how low the standing of Long Xiaoxiao’s chosen groom was.

This man was no other than Shengguang Jiahao.

They had known that Shengguang Jiahao wouldn’t be a good groom, but they didn’t know that he was that bad.

Just how great of a humiliation it would be for Long Xiaoxiao if she were to marry someone like that?

“Chu Feng, you really have to bring me to the Holy Light Clan with you now. I want to watch with my own eyes as you destroy them,” Long Xiaoxiao spat with gritted teeth.

“Didn’t we already agree on that? Don’t worry, I’ll hold to the end of my promise. It’s just that you might lose your life if I fail to defeat Shengguang Xuanye. Don’t blame me for that, alright?’ Chu Feng replied.

“I won’t,” Long Xiaoxiao replied.

“Chu Feng, bring me along too,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother suddenly spoke up.

“Alright,” Chu Feng replied with a nod.

Chu Feng could sense just how angry the mother-daughter pair was, and he felt the same way too. He had known that the Holy Light Clan was doing this intentionally to humiliate Long Xiaoxiao, but this was still too much.

Not to mention, part of the reason why the Holy Light Clan was doing this was to get back at him too.

Had Long Xiaoxiao not rejected the Holy Light Clan due to Chu Feng, she wouldn’t have been insulted in such a manner.

Ultimately, it was still Chu Feng’s fault.

Now that he thought about it, the Holy Light Clan even went to the extent of inviting all of the powerhouses over to attend the wedding ceremony. This was clearly a move to ruin the Dragon Clan and Long Xiaoxiao’s reputation.

If the wedding ceremony had proceeded as decided, both Long Xiaoxiao and the Dragon Clan would be ruined.

This wedding ceremony was as good as telling the entire world just how the Holy Light Clan viewed the Dragon Clan. From there on, the Dragon Clan would only spiral into decline.

“Senior, Xiaoxiao, I need the two of you to cooperate with me,” Chu Feng said.

“Young friend Chu Feng, feel free to ask anything of us. I’d be willing to lay down my life if you give me the word!” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother replied.

She knew that the only one who could really deal with the Holy Light Clan amongst them was Chu Feng, so naturally she would have to heed his instructions.

“It’s quite simple. I just need you to disguise yourself as Shengguang Yunyue,” Chu Feng replied.

Long Xiaoxiao’s mother agreed to the request.

Chu Feng quickly set up a disguise formation to transform her appearance into that of Shengguang Yunyue. Following that, the three of them quickly made their way into the Dragon Clan.

Chu Feng’s plan was simple.

Didn’t the Holy Light Clan want to embarrass Long Xiaoxiao in front of the powerhouses of the Holy Light Galaxy?

Since that was the case, he would make use of this opportunity to embarrass them instead!
