Chapter 4172 - Terrifying Aura

Being whipped, the grandfather-grandson pair began to scream nonstop.

In merely the blink of an eye, Long Xiao and his grandfather were completely mutilated.

However, the people present took no pity on them.

“Go feed this to him,” Lord Tonghe handed the poisonous pellet to the Nine Priciples Dragon Sect’s young sectmaster, Long Shangsong.

“Thank you Milord,” Long Shangsong accepted the poisonous pellet with great excitement. Then, he soared into the sky and began to slowly walk towards Chu Feng.

Even though Long Shangsong put forth a thorough performance, everyone knew that he was the vile man in the situation.

Yet, no one dared to look down on him.

On the contrary, they were all envious of him.

If they could return to the Dragon Clan and receive Lord Tonghe’s backing, they would be more than willing to become vile and lowly men themselves.

Seeing Long Shangsong walking towards him, Chu Feng was filled with unreconciliation.

Yet, he was powerless to escape.

The reason for that was because there was a powerful oppressive might sealing him.

At that moment, Chu Feng began to focus all of his energy into calling for the mysterious deer within him.

If the deer was willing to lend him its powers, Chu Feng felt that he might be able to escape.

Unfortunately, no matter how he called for the deer, he did not receive any response from it.

Right at that moment, a voice transmission entered Chu Feng’s ears.

Chu Feng did not feel the slightest amount of joy upon hearing that voice. Instead, he became even more displeased.

The reason for that was because the voice belonged to Long Shangsong.

“I’ve heard that the Dragon Vein Source Stone was discovered by you.”

“You’re truly quite capable.”

“But so what if you’re capable? In the end, it’s still our Nine Principles Dragon Sect that has returned to the Dragon Clan.”

“As for you, you can only wait for death here.”

“Did you really think that you could do whatever you wanted in this martial cultivation world just because you have exceptional talent?”

“You’re truly naive. Let me tell you this: while talent is important, background is even more important.”

“If no one is backing you, no matter how talented you might be, you will not be able to grow.”

“Of course, the reason why you’re receiving this sort of ending is because you’ve chosen the wrong opponent.”

“You shouldn’t have toyed with me.”

Long Shangsong had arrived before Chu Feng.

His brows were narrowed into an angry look. Hatred and killing intent were clearly visible in his eyes.

He pinched Chu Feng’s mouth with one hand and planned to place the poisonous medicine into Chu Feng’s mouth.

“If you dare touch him, I will wipe out your entire clan!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.

Then, a beautiful woman landed beside Chu Feng.

The crowd’s eyes all shone upon seeing that person.

That woman was as beautiful as a celestial fairy. Her beauty was truly rare in the world. Even a young master like Long Shangsong who had experienced countless women was stunned by the woman’s beauty.

However, Chu Feng narrowed his brows after he saw her.

The person that had come to his rescue was Fumo Xin’er.

Chu Feng had come there together with her.

However, Chu Feng was afraid that an accident might occur. Thus, he had told her to remain hidden and not reveal herself.

Chu Feng had planned to meet up with her once he had finished dealing with matters there.

Never did he expect for Fumo Xin’er to actually reveal herself.

“This has nothing to do with you. Leave right now,” Chu Feng said in a hurry.

He was currently confronted with the Dragon Clan. Chu Feng did not wish to implicate Fumo Xin’er.

Yet, no matter how he urged her to leave, Fumo Xin’er refused to cower. She completely ignored him.

An ice-cold gaze was present in her beautiful eyes. They were like two sharp blades staring at Long Shangsong.

“Release your hand.”

While Fumo Xin’er’s voice was pleasant to hear, it was also extremely fierce and emitting extreme killing intent.

At the beginning, Long Shangsong was not afraid of Fumo Xin’er. But, after seeing her gaze, extreme fear emerged in his heart.

Subconsciously, he let go of the hand pinching Chu Feng’s mouth and involuntarily took a step back.

That said, his fears soon dissipated.

The reason for that was because he discovered that even though the beauty standing before him emitted an extraordinary air and looked at him with fierceness, her cultivation was not that strong.

Although rank one Utmost Exalted was already very remarkable, she was simply not someone to be feared with Lord Tonghe and the other experts from the Dragon Clan present.

Thus, Long Shangsong regained his confidence. He revealed a ridiculing smile and looked at Chu Feng.

“Is this your woman? She’s pretty good looking. Unfortunately, she followed the wrong man.”

“Since she’s with you, it means that she’s your accomplice. Neither of you will escape from here today.”

“Especially you.”

After saying those words, Long Shangsong pointed to Fumo Xin’er and shouted angrily, “You dare threaten our Dragon Clan?! Who do you think you are?!”

“Who do you think you are?” Suddenly, another woman’s voice was heard.

That voice was also pleasant to the ears. It was also extremely fierce and cold.

But, that voice did not come from Fumo Xin’er. Instead, it came from the direction of the Dragon Clan. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Looking over, the crowd were all surprised.

They discovered who it was that had spoken.

But, the person who had spoken was a youth.

Furthermore, it was Long Xiao.

Why would Long Xiao speak in a woman’s voice?

But, that was not important. What was important was the transformation that had occurred to him.

He was originally being whipped by the martial power whips and on the verge of death.

Yet, his body was actually recovering. It was even emitting a faint glimmer.

With the glimmer enveloping his body, the whips were no longer able to harm him.

Just like that, Long Xiao stood up before the crowd’s eyes.

Furthermore, it was not only him. His grandfather also stood up.

“Impudent!”

Seeing the two of them standing up, the people from the Dragon Clan immediately drew their weapons and rushed towards them.

“Who dares?!”

Long Xiao’s grandfather waved his sleeve. Immediately, the weather changed, and a massive storm surged forth.

Violent wind swept past as black clouds appeared in the sky. Rocks and sand were lifted from the ground. The entire area was covered in smoke and dust.

Most terrifying of all, an enormously powerful oppressive sensation arrived.

All the Dragon Clansmen that had rushed towards Long Xiao and his grandfather were sent flying.

Even the people below were affected by the change.

Everyone could sense a suffocating power enveloping the region.

Not even Lord Tonghe was an exception.

Long Xiao’s grandfather’s strength actually surpassed even Lord Tonghe’s.

His strength surpassed everyone present. Furthermore, he was not only slightly stronger.

While his power could not be ranked at the peak of the Holy Light Galaxy, it was a level of strength that no one present could touch.

With how terrifyingly powerful Long Xiao’s grandfather was, the crowd all turned pale with fright.

The people from the Dragon Clan, the people below and even Long Daozhi and the people from his Ancestral Martial Dragon City were terrified by that old man’s strength.

As for the people from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect, they were completely flabbergasted.

What had happened to the old man and youth?

Why would they suddenly possess such terrifying power?

During their moment of crisis, it was Lord Tonghe who managed to keep his composure.

“You’ve actually hidden your cultivations?”

“Exactly who are you? You dare make an enemy out of our Dragon Clan?”

Even though his opponent was stronger than him, Lord Tonghe was not afraid.

In fact, even the others from the Dragon Clan were not afraid.
