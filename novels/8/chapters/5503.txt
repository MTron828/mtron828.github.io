Chapter 5503: It’s a Tribute Formation?

“How do you feel, Chu Feng? Can you withstand it?” Eggy asked worriedly.

“No worries, I can take it,” Chu Feng replied.

He did experience excruciating pain when the black aura seeped into his body, but it was within the range of his tolerance. Rather, he was more perplexed by a mysterious feeling that suffused him.

Finally, the pedestal stopped releasing the black aura, and Chu Feng slowly opened his eyes.

The crowd could sense that the invisible barrier that sealed off the pedestal had vanished, so they quickly fled from it out of fear that a mishap would happen once more. Even the Totem Dragon Clansmen behaved the same as well.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, a few people, such as Long Chengyu and Long Muxi, remained on the pedestal. There were also a few who were at the bottom of the pedestal all this while, such as Long Shanshan, who flitted over to Chu Feng’s side.

They were worried for him.

“How are you feeling, Chu Feng?”

This group of people looked at Chu Feng with concerned eyes.

“I’m fine,” Chu Feng replied.

“Are you certain? Don’t lie to me.”

The skeptical Long Chengyu grabbed Chu Feng’s wrist to inspect his condition. After a quick examination, he was shocked to see that the latter was in a healthy state even though his pulse was a little unstable. It didn’t seem like anything had happened to Chu Feng at all.

“Do you believe me now?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“The hell… Chu Feng, are you a monster? I couldn’t even withstand a small bit of that black aura! How are you after absorbing so much of it?! Brother, you need to stop being overpowered! At this rate, I’d feel embarrassed for being called a prodigy!” Long Chengyu stared at Chu Feng with his mouth agape.

“It just so happens that I’m proficient in world spiritist techniques and saw through the tempering, so I was able to thoroughly prepare myself for this. That allowed me to better withstand the black aura,” Chu Feng replied.

“Well, that woman from the Totem Phoenix Clan is a world spiritist too, but she fared worse than me,” Long Chengyu pointed out.

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen’s complexions darkened. Even a fool could tell that Long Chengyu was referring to Feng Jiuyue. What frustrated them more was how they were unable to refute Long Chengyu’s words.

On the one hand, Long Chengyu was right to say that Feng Jiuyue had fared worse than him. On the other hand, they were also weaker than Long Chengyu, so they couldn’t afford to act arrogantly around him.

“Chu Feng, did you receive any benefit from that?” Long Shanshan asked.

The crowd pricked up their ears, wanting to know what Chu Feng had received from absorbing the black aura.

This was especially so for Feng Jiuyue, who stared intently at Chu Feng with a mysterious glow in her eyes. It was her special observation means. She wanted to know what kind of benefit Chu Feng had received.

The Demon Crane had been known to be amicable to world spiritists, in the sense that world spiritists who entered its premises had always been able to attain some kind of benefit. Considering the exceptional circumstances this time around, Chu Feng’s reward should have been much greater than usual.

“Would you believe me if I said I didn’t receive anything at all?” Chu Feng asked with a bitter smile.

“That can’t be possible!”

The crowd’s first response was disbelief.

“It’s the truth. I didn’t get anything. Why else do you think I gave up earlier?” Chu Feng asked.

Those words added some credibility to Chu Feng’s words. The words he had said thus far had all come true, which reflected his perceptive insight. He had indeed initially given up on the trial, and it was only to help Long Chengyu and the others that he returned to the pedestal.

All of these supported the fact that Chu Feng wasn’t lying.

“What in the world is going on? Why did we receive nothing despite all we have been through? Is Daoist Demon Crane plotting something?” Long Chengyu exclaimed in displeasure.

He felt that Daoist Demon Crane was trying to make a fool out of them.

“Is this a scheme by Daoist Demon Crane to kill us? Now that I think about it, the black aura was trying to assimilate me earlier. Heavens, is this a tribute formation? We were nearly killed as tributes!”

“Daoist Demon Crane is out for our lives?!”

Long Chengyu’s words led the crowd to think that they might have been taken for a ride.

In particular, the theory about it being a tribute formation sounded plausible. With how secretive Daoist Demon Crane was, it didn’t seem too far-fetched to say that he cultivated demonic skills. The latter might be sacrificing them to master his demonic skill.

Boom!

The palace suddenly shook. The walls started to crumble, followed by everything else. By the time everything collapsed, the crowd realized that they had been teleported out of the Demon Crane back to the outside world.

Beneath their feet were the remains of the Demon Crane. The Demon Crane had shattered into countless fragments scattered all over the ground. Despite being an unparalleled treasure, its remains had no value whatsoever.

“The Demon Crane broke apart?”

Chu Feng and the others were taken aback.

Even those waiting outside were dumbstruck too. They had been waiting for the juniors of their respective powers to return, only to see cracks suddenly appearing on the Demon Crane before it shattered. Following that, the juniors that had entered the Demon Crane appeared one after another.

“What happened? Why did the Demon Crane shatter?”

The perplexed elders rushed forward to ask their juniors what had happened inside the Demon Crane, thinking that they would know better.

“It’s better off shattered. We were nearly killed by Daoist Demon Crane!” many juniors exclaimed with resentment.

“What? You were nearly killed by Daoist Demon Crane? What do you mean by that?”

The crowd was confused to hear that. The juniors shared what they had been through.

“A tribute formation? Daoist Demon Crane actually constructed a tribute formation inside the Demon Crane to use you all as fodders for his demonic skill? That explains why he escaped. That despicable thing!”

The elders were infuriated to hear the story, especially those whose juniors had entered the Demon Crane.

“Where’s Chu Feng?”

Quite a few people in the crowd started looking around for Chu Feng. They had learned from their juniors that the Totem Phoenix Clan had made a reappearance, and the Totem Dragon Clan’s prodigies, such as Long Chengyu and Long Muxi, were here too.

However, the person who piqued their interest the most was Chu Feng, for the one who saved the juniors were neither the prodigies from the Totem Phoenix Clan nor the Totem Dragon Clan but him. Chu Feng had single-handedly saved all of the juniors inside the Demon Crane.

Yet, the juniors of the Totem Phoenix Clan, Totem Dragon Clan, and Chu Feng were nowhere to be seen.

That was because Chu Feng and the Totem Dragon Clansmen had immediately concealed themselves after escaping from the Demon Crane and slipped back onto the Totem Dragon Clan’s warship.

The Totem Phoenix Clansmen had done the same as well. They had probably returned to their clansmen by now.
