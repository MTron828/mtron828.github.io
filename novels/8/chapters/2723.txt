Chapter 2723 - Intense Confrontation

“Arrogant bastard! Today, I’ll beat you till you kneel and beg for forgiveness!”

Chu Xianshuo was furious. However, regardless of how furious he might be, his tone had changed.

Originally, he was planning to kill Chu Feng. However now, he was only planning to teach Chu Feng a lesson and humiliate him without actually killing him.

This behavioral change occurred because Chu Feng had revealed that he trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

Chu Xianshuo felt that since Chu Feng was capable of training in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, he most definitely possessed an extraordinary background.

There were no Heavenly Clans in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that were capable of grasping the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

Because of this, Chu Xianshuo determined that Chu Feng must be from another Upper Realm. Furthermore, it was very possible that the power behind Chu Feng was the ruler of another Upper Realm.

A power like that would be no small matter. Even if they were weaker than their Chu Heavenly Clan, they would still be a huge monster.

If he were to rashly kill Chu Feng, he would likely court a major disaster for himself.

Thus, Chu Xianshuo no longer dared to kill Chu Feng.

Although he did not plan to kill Chu Feng, Chu Xianshuo would absolutely not let go of the opportunity to teach Chu Feng a lesson.

After all, no matter what, Chu Feng was a genius who trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. If he was able to defeat Chu Feng, it would be an extremely honorable feat.

Thus, at that moment, Chu Xianshuo openly revealed his oppressive might. Everyone present was capable of seeing it.

His oppressive might was shining brightly with golden light. With a spectacular significance and an imposing might that not even an army of ten thousand could withstand, it moved toward Chu Feng to oppress him.

However, faced with this incoming oppressive might, Chu Feng was completely calm and composed. Absolute confidence was being emitted from his eyes.

“Break!!!”

Suddenly, Chu Feng shouted out loud. Then, an enormous golden-bright and dazzling sword appeared before him.

That sword was naturally the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

Once the Ancient Era’s War Sword appeared, the incoming oppressive might capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas immediately vanished like smoke in thin air. It was forcibly beaten back by the sword. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This!!!”

Seeing such a thing, the surrounding crowd and even Chu Xianshuo were greatly shocked.

After all, the aura of the Ancient Era’s War Sword was no small matter. As such, its appearance would inevitably bring shock to people.

“What is that?!”

The first reaction the crowd had upon seeing the Ancient Era’s War Sword was astonishment.

Not to mention the extraordinary ruler-like aura emitted by the enormous sword, merely the power emitted by the enormous golden sword was more than sufficient to astonish the crowd.

The enormous golden sword actually possessed a heaven-defying power to surmount an entire level of cultivation.

“It’s a secret skill. What a powerful secret skill. Even for me, this is the first time I’ve encountered such a powerful secret skill,” at that moment, even the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master revealed a change in expression.

The reason for that was because he had never seen such a powerful secret skill in the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

Chu Feng had actually revealed the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and such a powerful secret skill, two abilities that could be said to be legendary, from the very get-go.

From this, he became even more certain that Chu Feng possessed an extraordinary origin.

“This Chu Feng has truly broadened my horizons,” even the fiery red-haired old man was unable to remain calm and collected.

He finally realized why Chu Feng dared to accept the rank four True Immortal Chu Xianshuo’s challenge with a cultivation of rank two True Immortal.

“Indeed, that child is extraordinary,” the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master spoke faintly.

He said those words with a very soft voice. Only the people from the Immortal Armament Villa were able to hear those words.

It seemed that the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was very reluctant to publicly praise Chu Feng.

“Lord Villa Master, do you think that Chu Feng will be able to win against Chu Xianshuo?” The fiery red-haired old man asked.

He was already impatient to know the outcome of the confrontation.

“I am unable to determine that. Chu Xianshuo, as someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, is most definitely not weak in terms of martial skills and abilities.”

“Whether or not Chu Feng will be able to defeat Chu Xianshuo will depend on whether or not he can continue to pleasantly surprise us,” the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

Hearing what the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said, the fiery red-haired old man and the others from the Immortal Armament Villa turned their gazes toward Chu Feng and Chu Xianshuo’s battlefield again.

The battle between them had just started. It was still unknown as to which of them would win and which would lose.

At this moment, they all started to concentrate on the battle. None of them wanted to miss a single detail.

“Chu Feng, as matters stand, I must admit that you do have some tricks.”

“However, if you felt that you would be able to defeat me with only that, then you are most definitely delusional.”

“While you, Chu Feng, might be a genius in martial cultivation, I, Chu Xianshuo am not a nobody either. You are not the only one who has managed to unleash the power of your Heavenly Bloodline.”

As Chu Xianshuo spoke, lightning began to flicker in his eyes. Soon, a dazzling Lightning Mark gathered on his forehead.

Earth. On his forehead was the character ‘Earth.’

Earthen level Lightning Mark. Chu Xianshuo had trained in the Earthen Punishment Mysterious Technique.

The Earthen Punishment Mysterious Technique was quite impressive indeed. It was no wonder Chu Xianshuo was known to be a genius.

Moreover, Chu Xianshuo had managed to successfully unseal the power of his Heavenly Bloodline, the power of the Lightning Mark. This better verified that his reputation as a genius was fully justified.

Had it been before, people would definitely look at him with admiration and start praising him once he unleashed his Lightning Mark.

Unfortunately, his Earthen Punishment Mysterious Technique had completely lost its splendor compared to Chu Feng’s Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.

However, regardless, it remained that he had managed to form his Lightning Mark, an ability capable of increasing his battle power.

Furthermore, what Chu Xianshuo trained in was the Earthen Punishment Mysterious Technique. Thus, his battle power had increased enormously.

Even though he was unable to increase his cultivation, his battle power was much stronger than before.

“Receive my attack.”

As Chu Xianshuo spoke, his clothes fluttered about, and boundless oppressive might was once again emitted from his body.

This time around, both the momentum and power behind his oppressive might were much stronger than before.

“Buzz~~~”

However, when that oppressive might reached the Ancient Era’s War Sword, it was once again dissipated.

“This...”

Seeing that scene, Chu Xianshuo not only started to frown, but he even opened his mouth in shock.

Even though he had unleashed his Lightning Mark, he was actually still unable to shake that Ancient Era’s War Sword. This verified how powerful Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword was.

“I refuse to believe this!”

Chu Xianshuo flipped his wrist, and a silver blade appeared in his hand.

That blade was over three meters long. It was very well-crafted, and emitted an extraordinary aura. It was an Incomplete Immortal Armament.

Furthermore, it was a very high quality Incomplete Immortal Armament.

“I refuse to believe that you will be able to block the following attack!”

With the Incomplete Immortal Armament in hand, Chu Xianshuo’s battle power increased once more. He began to thrust his Incomplete Immortal Armament forth repeatedly. Blade rays started to shoot toward Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Sword continuously.

“Clank, clank, clank~~~”

Ear-piercing rumbles began to be heard repeatedly. The Ancient Era’s War Sword had started to waver.

However, Chu Xianshuo’s attacks were merely a test to probe things out. They were merely casual attacks.

Following that, he began to use martial skills.

When he unleashed Mortal Taboo Martial Skills to attack the Ancient Era’s War Sword, the Ancient Era’s War Sword was no longer capable of withstanding the attacks, and was pushed back repeatedly.

At that moment, Chu Xianshuo was finally able to see the dawn of victory.

“Buzz~~~”

However, with a thought from Chu Feng, the Ancient Era’s War Sword actually started to fly backwards.

When the Ancient Era’s War Sword arrived before Chu Feng, it started to emit a special light.

The next moment, the Ancient Era’s War Sword actually fused with Chu Feng. Chu Feng had entered the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

Chu Feng’s battle power did not decrease after he entered the Ancient Era’s War Sword, and the Ancient Era’s War Sword covered him like a defensive formation.

Faced with Chu Xianshuo’s aggressive attacks, Chu Feng, together with his Ancient Era’s War Sword, was beaten back nonstop.

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng remained calm and composed. Suddenly, Chu Feng flipped his wrist, and the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler appeared in his hand.
