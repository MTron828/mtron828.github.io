Chapter 4755: Utterly Shameless

“How did he manage to control the Tiger Serpent so easily? Am I seeing things?”

Everyone couldn’t believe what they were seeing. They had seen for themselves just how powerful the Tiger Serpent was, and yet, Chu Feng actually managed to place it under his control just like that.

They could clearly sense Chu Feng’s cultivation, and it was only at rank seven Utmost Exalted level.

Could a rank seven Utmost Exalted level cultivator really control a rank five Martial Exalted level beast with just six soul possession treasures? That didn’t make sense!

“You need not panic anymore. I’ve already placed this Tiger Serpent under my control,” Chu Feng said.

He then turned to the Tiger Serpent and murmured, “It’s lucky that I woke up on time, or else it would be a great deal of trouble if you continue evolving at this rate. You nearly foiled my plans. So, you have to die for that.”

Under Chu Feng’s control, the Tiger Serpent began to climb out of the sphere of wind, revealing its full body. The aura it emanated with its full presence was far stronger than before.

It flew a distance away before exploding with a loud boom. Despite the self-explosion, the beast wasn’t reduced to smithereens. All Chu Feng did was to explode its flesh and blood, choosing to leave its bone completely intact.

He knew that the bones of the beasts in the Vicious Beast Hellworld could be used for cultivation, which meant that the bones of the Tiger Serpent were likely to be true cultivation treasures.

“It looks like the beasts here are indeed created by a formation.”

However, upon seeing the Tiger Serpent’s carcass, Chu Feng felt a little disappointed. He was intending to collect the source energies of the beasts here and give them to Eggy and Yu Sha, but it turned out that the beasts here didn’t contain any source energies at all.

This verified Chu Feng’s conjecture that the beasts in this Vicious Beast Hellworld were artificial lifeforms. They were nurtured by a special formation using some sort of treasure, granting them the power to cultivate. However, just because they were able to grow stronger didn’t mean that they were real living beings, and the proof lay in how they lacked source energies and a soul.

“It looks like the sect founder is really a formidable individual.”

While the lack of source energies was disappointing, this also testified to the tremendous prowess the founder of the Hidden Dragon Formation Sect possessed. Chu Feng would have never imagined that it was possible to nurture such lifeforms using spirit power.

At the very least, it was impossible for him at the moment.

“Look, the storm is starting to dissipate!”

“The crisis is over! We’re saved!”

“Junior Chu Feng, you’re incredible! You stopped the Cleansing and resolved this catastrophe!”

The terrifying black tornado gradually dissipated and the Vicious Beast Hellworld reverted back to its original form. Knowing that the calamity was over, the disciples immediately cheered in excitement. Zhao Shi and Ma Yueyue even ran over to Chu Feng’s side excitedly.

Ma Yueyue leaped forth to hug Chu Feng, and Zhao Shi quickly did the same too. Admiration could see in the depths of their eyes.

There was also a change in how the other personal disciples looked at Chu Feng too. Compared to before, there was a hint of respect in their eyes.

With everything that had happened thus far, it was clear to them that Chu Feng’s feat of breaking Lord Dugu Lingtian’s record wasn’t just a fluke. He did have the strength and capability to back it up.

Faced with the crowd’s compliments, Chu Feng simply smiled in response, not saying a word at all.

“You’re thanking him? Was he the one who resolved this calamity?”

However, while everyone was still immersed in their joy and relief of having survived a desperate situation, a dissonant voice suddenly sounded in the air.

The crowd immediately fell silent upon hearing those words, for the one who had spoken was Zuoqiu Yanliang.

Everyone could sense Zuoqiu Yanliang’s displeasure.

The bootlicker, Duanmu Xiang, turned to Zuoqiu Yanliang and said, “The bones of the Hellking is a precious cultivation resource. Everyone has contributed to resolving the calamity here today, so Senior Zuoqiu, how should we distribute it?”

Zuoqiu Yanliang was currently seated on the ground with cross legs. With Song Qian’s help, he was able to heal up his injuries by a fair bit. However, he didn’t rise to his feet right away. He continued recuperating for a moment longer before finally opening his eyes to look at the crowd.

“Do you think that I should be the one to distribute the bones of the Hellking?”

His words carried a deeper meaning behind them. It was as if he was asking if ‘Do you still recognize me to be the strongest one amongst you all?’.

“Senior Zuoqiu, you carry the greatest strength and highest prestige amongst us all. It’s only right for you to determine the distribution of the Hellking’s bones. You’re the one who has contributed the most to stopping the Cleansing, so who else could be worthy aside from you?”

Under the Duanmu Brothers’ lead, the other personal disciples began chirping in too. Even before leaving the Vicious Beast Hellworld, they were already starting to snatch the credit here.

“Since everyone thinks so, I shall determine the distribution then.”

Zuoqiu Yanliang was pleased with everyone’s response. He even directed a provocative look in Chu Feng’s direction, as if saying ‘So what if you’re the one who defeated the Tiger Serpent? The credit is still going to me anyway’.

Zuoqiu Yanliang’s shameless action greatly displeased Li Muzhi and the others, but Chu Feng thought nothing about it. He simply watched this farce with a smile on his lips.

Zuoqiu Yanliang really didn’t put on airs and started distributing the Tiger Serpent. All of the disciples present got a share of it, except for a few, namely Chu Feng, Li Muzhi, Ma Yueyue, Zhao Shi, and the others. Basically, all of the disciples who handed their soul possession treasures to Chu Feng were excluded here. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Senior Zuoqiu, isn’t it unfair for you to distribute the bones in such a manner?” Li Muzhi questioned.

“Unfair? How am I unfair?” Zuoqiu Yanliang asked.

“Everyone has come here with the intent to stop this calamity, and I don’t deny that everyone ought to get a share here. However, it was Junior Chu Feng who contributed the most to killing the Hellking here. If anyone has the right to distribute the bones here, it should be Junior Chu Feng. Yet, you didn’t even give Junior Chu Feng a share at all!” Li Muzhi remarked grimly.

He was afraid of Zuoqiu Yanliang, but he couldn’t stand how shameless Zuoqiu Yanliang was being over here.

“Li Muzhi, do you know why neither Chu Feng nor the other six of you aren’t given anything at all?” Zuoqiu Yanliang asked.

“It’s precisely because I can’t understand the rationale behind this decision that I’m asking about it,” Li Muzhi replied.

“Do you really think that it’s Chu Feng who defeated the Hellking? Did you think that you have made a huge contribution just by handing the soul possession treasures to Chu Feng, allowing him to control the Hellking?

“Let me tell you this, you have done nothing that helped in killing the Hellking! It was my Hidden Dragon Sword Formation that severely injured it in the first place! Putting Chu Feng aside, anyone else could have easily used the soul possession treasure to control the Hellking. It was already severely injured by that point in time, having hardly any consciousness at all.

“It was I, Zuoqiu Yanliang, who severely injured the Hellking. Chu Feng is merely enjoying the fruits of my effort!” Zuoqiu Yanliang said.

“Zuoqiu Yanliang, you...”

Li Muzhi was so angry that his veins were on the verge of popping out.

He would have never imagined that Zuoqiu Yanliang would be this shameless. Everyone could tell that his attacks were useless earlier on, and it even led to a catastrophe for them. It was Chu Feng who single-handedly turned things around and saved them all.

Yet, Zuoqiu Yanliang twisted the story to make it sound as if Chu Feng was enjoying the gains of his hard work.

In truth, everyone was also rendered speechless by Zuoqiu Yanliang’s speech. For the first time, everyone got a glimpse of just what kind of person Zuoqiu Yanliang was.

Before this, no one thought that Zuoqiu Yanliang would actually be so shameless. Even if he wanted to steal some credit, his reason was still a little too forced that it was practically an outright lie.
