Chapter 1960 - The Unavoidable Battle

“But, little friend Chu Feng, even if we manage to prevent it this once, it will be difficult to prevent it again. As long as the Moon Demon is still in the Moonlight Maze, the Dark Hall can use other methods to awaken its demonic nature.”

“Thus...”

“Thus, you all want to use the Fire and Ice Pearls to turn the Moon Demon into the Moon Immortal, and then have the Moon Immortal work for you all, is that right?” Chu Feng said.

“That is indeed what we have in mind. It is also the best option. After all, the Dark Hall, that dangerous and troubling power, should be eliminated as quickly as possible. Otherwise, there will be no peace in the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“You also know that the Dark Hall has captured all of the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts from the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. However, they have not released those Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts upon the world. We do not know exactly what they’re planning to do, exactly what sort of conspiracy they have in mind. However, one thing is certain: the Dark Hall is extremely dangerous,” Lord Luokong said.

At that moment, Chu Feng grew silent. It was true that the Dark Hall was very dangerous. Not only did they know about a lot of the Holy Land of Martialism’s secrets, they might even know things that the other residents of the Holy Land of Martialism did not.

No one knew exactly what the Dark Hall was planning to do. However, whatever it was they planned to do would definitely be extremely dangerous and detrimental to the lives of those in the Holy Land of Martialism.

“Big brother Chu Feng, we already know about the matters concerning you and the Dark Hall. Allow us to help you out. If we could save the people of the world by giving up our cultivation, if we could help you, it would truly be worth it,” Su Mei said with a beaming smile.

“Chu Feng, think of the greater good,” Su Rou also spoke.

In fact, Chu Feng was unable to find any reason to refuse them either.

Merely... as he saw his two beloved women willing to sacrifice their cultivations and bring harm to their own bodies to help him, Chu Feng felt enormous pain.

In the end, it was because he was not strong enough. Else, there would be no need for them to go to such means.

“In that case, what’s the plan?” Chu Feng asked.

“According to our understanding of the Moonlight Maze, the map that the Dark Hall has spread will successfully lead the crowd to the Immortality Peach Tree,” Lord Luokong said. [1. Technically, Saturn Peach Tree. However, Saturn Peach are peaches of immortality kept by the Queen Mother of the West, a goddess in Chinese mythology.]

“Immortality Peach Tree?” Chu Feng’s eyes brightened.

“The Immortality Peach Tree is one of the most famous treasures in the Moonlight Maze. By eating an Immortality Peach, one can extend one’s lifespan by a hundred years,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.

“It’s actually that miraculous? Does that Immortality Peach Tree really exist?” Chu Feng asked.

If such a treasure really did exist, it would truly be a treasure to prolong one’s life. Many of the people that Chu Feng knew were already near the limits of their lifespan. If he could obtain Immortality Peaches, he would be able to assist those people.

“Actually, that’s a question I’d like to ask too,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal looked to Lord Luokong.

“There is indeed an Immortality Peach Tree. However, as for the people that have actually seen the Immortality Peach Tree, it is likely only we Ancient Era’s Elves and the Five Emperors who have seen it after the end of the Ancient Era,” Lord Luokong said.

“It really exists?” After hearing those words, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal revealed a smile of anticipation. He said, “It is no wonder that your Ancient Era’s Elves were able to live for so long.”

“Cough cough...” Lord Luokong coughed twice. Evidently, what the Weaponry Refinement said was correct. Thus, Lord Luokong blushed slightly in embarrassment.

“Actually, the harvest that our Ancient Era’s Elves obtained was not as much as you all might be thinking. Although the Immortality Peach Tree is very large, the time at which its fruits mature are all different. Thus, our Ancient Era’s Elves would only enter the Moonlight Maze once every five hundred years. Furthermore, we would only be able to harvest several hundred peaches each time,” Lord Luokong said.

“Several hundred? And you all still consider that to not be a lot?” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal revealed an expression of disdain. He added, “It is not good for you all to monopolize the Immortality Peach Tree.”

“Well, with the situation now, it would appear to be impossible for them to monopolize the Immortality Peach Tree anymore. After all, the destination of that map is the location of the Immortality Peach Tree,” Chu Feng said as he took out the map that had been spread by the Dark Hall.

“But, didn’t the Dark Hall want to kill people in the Moonlight Maze? Could it be... that they plan to set up an ambush there?” Chu Feng asked.

“No... the location where the Immortality Peach Tree is located is a killing formation to begin with. If that killing formation were to be activated, all of the people inside would be killed.”

“Furthermore, I believe that the people from the Dark Hall should know the method to activate the killing formation. That is why they spread the map to lead the crowd there,” Lord Luokong said.

“You mean to say that the location where the Immortality Peach Tree is located is a slaughterhouse? By entering it, people will be killed?” Chu Feng asked.

“Then, what about the Immortality Peach Tree? Wouldn’t that Immortality Peach Tree be destroyed?” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal seemed to care more about the Immortality Peach Tree. [2. Dude is old, give him a break.]

“No, that killing formation only kills people, and will not injure the Immortality Peach Tree.”

“Actually, there are a lot of killing formations in the Moonlight Maze. However, they all only kill people, and will not harm any of the treasures inside the Moonlight Maze,” Lord Luokong said.

“Then, how are we to prevent that from happening?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s the troubling aspect,” Lord Luokong sighed. He added, “I know where the core of the Immortality Peach Tree’s killing formation is located. As long as it is destroyed, the Immortality Peach Tree’s killing formation will also be destroyed.”

“Merely, due to our greed, we did not destroy that killing formation. And now, if we want to destroy the core, the people of the Dark Hall should have already made preparations for us. As such, it will be impossible to avoid a fierce battle,” Lord Luokong said.

“How did you all come to know about that formation’s core? Did Qing Xuantian tell you all?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng asked that question because he discovered that it was not the Ancient Era’s Elves that knew the most about the Moonlight Maze. Instead, Qing Xuantian knew about it more than them. As such, he felt that the location of that formation’s core should also have been told to the Ancient Era’s Elves by Qing Xuantian.

“We are truly ashamed to mention it. However, it was indeed Qing Xuantian who told us about it. After Qing Xuantian defeated our then Majesty and forced us to share our Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds, he also felt that he owed us. As such, he told us about the matter regarding the Immortality Peach Tree.”

“As for that formation’s core, it was also Qing Xuantian who discovered it. Merely, he was unable to destroy it back then. He would have needed to use a spirit formation to destroy the defenses of that formation’s core. However, to destroy those defenses would have taken at least a thousand years.”

“That’s why Qing Xuantian told us about that core. He wanted us to destroy that formation’s core and that killing formation after a thousand years passed,” Lord Luokong did not conceal this fact.

“However, due to selfishness, you all did not do as senior Qing Xuantian advised,” Su Mei said frankly and criticized the Ancient Era’s Elves.

“Indeed, it was because we were selfish.It truly is a shameful thing,” Lord Luokong smiled bitterly.

“Enough about that. We shouldn’t mention the things of the past anymore. Right now, our top priority is to prevent the Dark Hall from harming the innocent.”

“Lord Luokong, do you have a detailed plan in mind?” Chu Feng asked.

“I do,” Lord Luokong nodded.

Then, Lord Luokong spoke of his plan.

It turned out that the killing formation’s core was not located in the same place as the killing formation itself. As such, Lord Luokong planned to separate the people here into two groups.

He wanted Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to proceed for the Immortality Peach Tree with the ignorant masses and try to use their world spirit techniques to prevent the activation of the killing formation. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As for the Ancient Era’s Elves, they would lead their army to the location where the killing formation’s core was located. As long as they destroyed the core, the killing formation would be destroyed too. As such, there would no longer be any danger.

Merely, although this matter seemed to be easy to do, everyone knew that it would not be easy at all.

After all, based on what had happened earlier in the Blood Devouring Killing Formation, they knew that the Dark Hall’s strength could not be looked down upon. This time around, they had created such a major commotion. As such, they would most definitely be prepared.

The people from the Dark Hall would definitely guard that killing formation’s core. The reason for that was because the location to activate the killing formation was in the same location as the killing formation’s core.

In short... a fierce battle was unavoidable.
