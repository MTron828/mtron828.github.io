Chapter 4235 - Is There Anyone Else That Is Still Unconvinced?

“Young friend, could you introduce yourself?”

Old Man Compliance did not bother paying attention to the people that greeted him respectfully. Instead, he looked directly at Chu Feng.

“Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to senior.” Chu Feng immediately clasped his fist respectfully to greet Old Man Compliance.

“Chu Feng? Very good.” Old Man Compliance nodded. Then, with a flick of his wrist, a rectangular case appeared in his hand.

The case was two feet long and a foot wide. It appeared very simple and unadorned.

Although it looked slightly shabby, one could tell from a single glance that it was something extraordinary.

At that moment, many people used special observational methods to try to see through the case and see what was inside.

But none of them were able to see through it.

Because of that, the crowd began making guesses nonstop. They all felt what was inside the case was most certainly a priceless treasure.

After all, Old Man Compliance had taken out the case in such a serious manner. That in itself was enough to signify how valuable the case was.

Old Man compliance raised the case in his hand and said to the crowd, “Young friend Chu Feng has opened the Hidden Gate. This is his additional reward.”

“Reward? There’s a reward?”

The crowd were endlessly envious after hearing those words.

Such a priceless treasure was going to fall into the hands of that unknown fellow?

“Milord, exactly what is that reward?” Someone asked curiously.

“It is naturally an essential treasure to young world spiritists like yourselves,” said Old Man Compliance.

Once he said those words, the crowd that were already filled with envy became even more envious.

But, at that moment, Old Man Compliance spoke again.

“But according to the rules, if someone is unconvinced with this, they can issue a challenge.”

“If their world spirit techniques surpass the person who is to obtain this reward, they can obtain this treasure instead.”

“Of course, if they fail their challenge, they’ll have to pay a price too. That is, they will no longer be qualified to set foot into this Ancient Compliance Castle for the rest of their life,” said Old Man Compliance.

“This punishment!”

Hearing those words, hesitation appeared on the faces of many people.

This punishment was simply too severe.

The reason why the Ancient Compliance Castle held such appeal to them was because of the Compliance Mirror.

Although they could only use the Compliance Mirror once every time they were in the Ancient Compliance Castle, they could use it whenever they entered the Ancient Compliance Castle again.

In other words, as long as they were strong enough, they would be able to obtain a treasure that could immediately help them every time they set foot into the Ancient Compliance Castle.

To them, the value of the Ancient Compliance Castle was simply enormous.

It wouldn’t even be excessive to say that it was an endless treasure trove.

If they were unable to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle again, it would be an enormous price to pay.

Because they didn’t know exactly how powerful Chu Feng was, many people were hesitating.

Even though they were unconvinced by Chu Feng and did not approve of him getting the treasure, they still didn’t dare take on such a risk to challenge him.

They were afraid.

What if they ended up being defeated by him? The price they would have to pay was simply too much.

“I’ll challenge him.”

Right at that moment, a voice was heard.

It was Chen Guang.

Compared to the others, Chen Guang knew Chu Feng somewhat.

Although he was very surprised by Chu Feng’s opening of the Hidden Gate, the impression that Chu Feng had given him during their first encounter was simply too bad.

As such, Chen Guang had looked down on Chu Feng the entire time.

He felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than trash.

Even though Chu Feng had opened the Hidden Gate, he felt that it must’ve been because of luck.

Even if Chu Feng possessed true ability, Chen Guang still felt that Chu Feng would not match up to him.

“Introduce yourself before your challenge,” said Old Man Compliance.

He naturally knew who Chen Guang was, but he was strict with the rules.

Everyone knew Old Man Compliance’s personality. As such, Chen Guang did not take offense to it, and gave a self-introduction.

“I am the disciple of the North Star Heavenly Master, Chen Guang.”

“I am unconvinced with this Chu Feng.”

“Because of that, I will issue a challenge. I wonder if this brother dares accept my challenge?” Chen Guang asked with a stern, sonorous and powerful voice. Not only could his confidence be felt through his voice, one could also sense his desire to challenge Chu Feng.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you have no choice. If you refuse to accept the challenge, it’ll be equivalent to admitting defeat.”

“Should that happen, this treasure will belong to Chen Guang,” Old Man Compliance warned Chu Feng.

“Since I have no choice, I won’t have to make one.” Chu Feng revealed a faint smile.

Then, he turned to Chen Guang and said, “Brother Chen Guang, due to my personal issues last time, we were unable to spar. This will serve to make up for the regret from last time.”

“Chen Guang, step onto the stage.”

As Old Man Compliance spoke, he waved his sleeve, and a spirit formation gate appeared before Chen Guang.

Chen Guang stepped into the spirit formation gate and entered the sealed region.

Chen Guang did not directly begin the battle. Instead, he turned to Old Man Compliance and asked respectfully, “Milord, are there any rules?”

“The two of you can decide the rules for yourselves.”

As Old Man Compliance spoke, he formed a rocking chair with his spirit formation and sat on it with his eyes closed.

He appeared to be unconcerned about the outcome of the spar between Chu Feng and Chen Guang.

“Since that’s the case, let’s decide the rules then.”

Right after Chen Guang spoke, Chu Feng said, “We’re all in a rush for time here. Let’s finish this quickly. We can directly use our world spirit techniques to determine a victor.”

“You mean to say, you want us to fight directly using world spirit techniques?” Chen Guang asked. He was slightly surprised by Chu Feng’s proposal.

“That’s right. That’s my intention.” Chu Feng nodded.

“Very well. Since that’s the case, I won’t hold back.”

As Chen Guang spoke, he began setting up a spirit formation.

He wanted to seize the decisive opportunity.

“Woosh---”

But, to his surprise, Chu Feng didn’t bother to make any preparations at all. He directly raised his hand and sent forth a palm strike. His spirit power was shot forth from the cuff of his sleeve.

His released spirit power immediately began to transform. It turned into a golden rhinoceros measuring over ten meters long that rushed straight toward Chen Guang.

“This guy!”

Chen Guang hadn’t thought that Chu Feng would launch a direct attack at him.

Such an attack was simply too imperious.

It simply resembled a martial cultivator attacking using martial power without using any martial skills.

It did not befit the glamor of a world spiritist battle.

What surprised Chen Guang the most was that Chu Feng’s golden rhinoceros that he’d sent forth so casually was extremely fast. By the time he managed to react to it, he was unable to avoid it.

But, Chen Guang did not panic. The spirit formation he was setting up was one that could be used both offensively and defensively. Furthermore, it was a spirit formation whose power was determined by how long he took to set it up.

He was totally capable of releasing it immediately.

Moreover, he felt that it would be an effortless task for him to block Chu Feng’s attack.

As such, Chen Guang didn’t panic, he was instead immensely pleased with himself. Just like that, he stopped setting up his spirit formation and used it to block the incoming rhinoceros.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s golden rhinoceros arrived before Chen Guang.

The golden rhinoceros showed no fear when facing Chen Guang’s bastion-like spirit formation. It lowered its head and charged forth with its horn.

“Boom---”

In the next instant, a loud explosion was heard, and energy ripples scattered in all directions.

What followed stunned everyone.

The golden rhinoceros had not only effortlessly crushed Chen Guang’s spirit formation to pieces, even Chen Guang had been sent flying by the charge.

Most importantly, Chen Guang was completely bloodied when he landed on the ground. He had grown extremely weak.

He was no longer capable of fighting. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although they all knew that an outcome would be determined by the match, that was Chen Guang of all people, one of the most outstanding geniuses of the younger generation.

Whilst everyone was still immersed in shock, Chu Feng suddenly spoke, “Is there anyone else that’s still unconvinced?”
