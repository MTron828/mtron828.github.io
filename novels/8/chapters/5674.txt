Chapter 5674: The Right Owner

The Asura King, Kui Ting, and the top experts of the Asura World Spirit Army, such as Yunliang and Xiangji, all appeared before Chu Feng’s eyes.

However, their cultivation was stronger than before, and it was a significant growth.

Xiangji, Yunliang, and the others were previously at rank six Half-God level, and their cultivation plummeted to rank three Half-God level after contracting with Chu Feng. However, they were now at rank eight Half-God level.

As for the Asura King, he was previously at rank seven Half-God level, and his cultivation regressed to rank four Half-God level after contracting with Chu Feng. However, he was now a rank nine Half-God level expert, just a step away from reaching True God level.

This was a height they had never reached, and it had happened in an instant. The Asura King and the other Asura World Spirits were confused, unable to comprehend what had just happened.

“It’s been a long time, elders,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

The Asura King and the others saw Chu Feng, and they noticed that he didn’t look surprised by the turn of events at all. This made them realize that he knew what was going on.

“Paying respect to Lord Chu Feng,” the Asura King first kneeled down with his army to pay respect to Chu Feng.

“Spare with the ceremony,” Chu Feng replied as he stepped across the door to support the Asura King up to his feet.

“Lord Chu Feng, do you know what’s going on with our cultivation?”

“It’s related to this door,” Chu Feng said before explaining the situation to them.

“Lord Chu Feng… is this really not a dream? Did our cultivation really grow by so much?” the Asura World Spirits nervously asked.

“Of course, this is all real. Your cultivation won’t regress anymore,” Chu Feng replied.

Waa!

The Asura World Spirit Army was overjoyed to hear that. It was not just the Asura King, Yunliang, Xiangji, and the others who had enjoyed an increase in their cultivation but all of them.

Previously, most of the Asura World Spirits were at Martial Exalted level. A million of them were at pinnacle Martial Exalted level, and only ten thousand had reached Half-God level.

However, the recent breakthrough from the release of the gate’s second and third seal had boosted millions of them up to Half-God level. Even the weakest of them was at pinnacle Martial Exalted level.

They were now much stronger than before.

“Lord Chu Feng,” Lord Xiangji suddenly kneeled down before Chu Feng with tears of regret. The crowd was perplexed by his actions till he spoke up, “I have cultivated for so many years, only to raise my cultivation from rank three Half-God level to rank six. Yet, within a year of following Lord Chu Feng, my cultivation was bumped up to rank eight Half-God level. How could I have been so foolish as to doubt Lord Chu Feng before? I deserve to die!”

The other Asura World Spirits also kneeled down in guilt after hearing those words.

Many of them had been opposed to following Chu Feng back then, as they had to contract with him and suffer a decline in their cultivation. If not for the Asura King taking the lead, a lot of them would have turned down the offer.

Ultimately, Chu Feng was too weak to win their trust back then.

It was only now that they realized what kind of incredible potential Chu Feng harnessed. If not for the Asura King and Lord Yunliang’s wisdom, they would have missed this opportunity of their lifetime.

“Elders, please get up,” Chu Feng said.

However, the kneeling Asura World Spirits refused to get up. They were ashamed of themselves.

“Are you disregarding my orders right now?” Chu Feng frowned.

The Asura World Spirits quickly rose to their feet and explained, “Lord Chu Feng, we have no such intention. We are just…”

Chu Feng knew what they wanted to say. He waved his hand to gesture for them not to explain and said, “Many of you were stronger than me when we sealed the contract, but you were still willing to serve me. I remember the trust you have put in me. I told you back then I’ll help you regain your cultivation and go further than that. I’m only doing what I have promised.”

“Yes, Lord Chu Feng said that he’ll help us regain our cultivation within a hundred years, but it has only been a year and we have already surpassed our previous height. We’re humbled,” Yunliang said with a chuckle.

“Long live Lord Chu Feng!” The other Asura World Spirits cheered.

“You need not thank me. I did not do much. The true credit lies with the Heavenly King of Massacre,” Chu Feng said as he glanced at the gate.

The gate was both a treasure and a part of God’s Contract with the Asura World Spirit Army. Chu Feng had a feeling that the Asura World Spirit Army had previously failed to make much progress in their cultivation because their progress had been devoured by God’s Contract.

They were just getting the results of their cultivation back now.

Chu Feng had no idea why the Heavenly King of Massacre did that, but in any case, he had benefited from it.

The Asura World Spirit Army also fell silent looking at the gate. How could they forget their past master, the Heavenly King of Massacre?

“Regardless, Lord Chu Feng, my cultivation rose after I came to serve you. You’re the one I am grateful to,” Xiangji said.

The other Asura World Spirits also expressed a similar stance. They were in a high mood due to the rise in their cultivation.

All of a sudden, the Asura King asked, “Lord Chu Feng, is there still a limit to how many times you can summon us?”

“There is still a limit, but I’d only know the exact details after I summon you. There’s a silver lining though. While I won’t be able to tap into your strength when the gate closes once more, that’d be a chance for me to raise your cultivation,” Chu Feng said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Lord Chu Feng, you’re saying that our cultivation will be further raised the next time you unseal the gate?” the Asura King asked.

“That’s right, but it won’t be that easy. I unsealed three seals this time around, but I have a feeling the fourth one won’t be as easy. I’ll need some time to comprehend it,” Chu Feng said.

“Doesn’t that mean there’s no limit to how far we can raise our cultivation as long as Lord Chu Feng is around?” the Asura World Spirit Army asked in excitement.

“There’s bound to be a limit to how far the formation can raise your cultivation, but please be assured that you won’t be limited by that. As long as I’m around, I’ll make sure that there’s no ceiling to your cultivation,” Chu Feng spoke with absolute confidence.

“Long live Lord Chu Feng! May Lord Chu Feng live for ten thousand years!”

The Asura World Spirit Army threw their hands into the sky, showing no doubt for Chu Feng’s words at all.

“Don’t talk nonsense. There’s no way Lord Chu Feng would only live for ten thousand years. His lifespan will be as long as the world itself,” the Asura King corrected them with a smile. He was as excited as the other Asura World Spirits too, though he wasn’t visibly showing it.

He was certain that his decision to follow Chu Feng back then was the right one now.
