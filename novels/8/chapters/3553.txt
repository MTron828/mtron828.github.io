Chapter 3553 - Terrifying Goal

After a series of inquiries, Chu Feng learned that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s peak experts were practically all killed in the battle back then.

The bunch of Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen that they’d encountered could not be considered to belong to the actual Blood-devouring Demon Clan. At most, they could only be considered a very small branch clan. That was also the reason why they were able to survive without being discovered.

That said, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan still possessed very abundant resources. By relying on the cultivation methods left behind by their forefathers and secretly recuperating their strength for thousands of years, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan now numbered over a hundred thousand clansmen. Furthermore, they had managed to nurture many experts.

The current Blood-devouring Demon Clan was most definitely not an existence the powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm could contend against. They were so powerful that they could play a role in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

The number of Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen that had arrived at the Void Sacred Tree was not a lot, only three thousand. However, those three thousand were all the elites of the current Blood-devouring Demon Clan.

They had travelled there following their clan chief. As for their purpose, it was precisely to revitalize their Blood-devouring Demon Clan.

The Void Sacred Tree had an inseparable connection with their Blood-devouring Demon Clan. That said, as to what exactly that inseparable connection was, clansmen of their level had no idea at all.

That said, this Blood-devouring Demon Clansman also revealed why they were trying to capture people from the Starfall Holy Land and Ghost Sect Hall.

Actually, they were not only targeting people from the Starfall Holy Land and Ghost Sect Hall. Instead, they wanted to capture all of the people that entered the Void Sacred Tree.

They intended to refine the souls of the people that they’d captured. Using the living souls, they planned to open a gate.

They did not know what was inside that gate. However, it was likely related to the revitalization of their Blood-devouring Demon Clan.

Chu Feng forced several other Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen to answer his questions. However, their responses were all the same.

According to Chu Feng’s observations, they were likely not lying. That was likely all that they knew.

After obtaining the information, Chu Feng no longer continued with the torture of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen. He also did not kill them. Instead, he imprisoned all of them using his world spirit techniques.

Then, he put away the spirit formation cage that he imprisoned them in.

“Young friend Chu Feng, it is truly thanks to you this time around.”

“No, it should be young master Chu Feng. I have misspoken, I have misspoken.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master, who had watched everything unfold, finally walked over to talk to Chu Feng after seeing that he had finished settling things.

“Senior Hall Master, you can address me whichever way you prefer. There is no need to be so restrained. Besides, I am a junior, whereas you are my senior,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“I am the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master. My name is Nangong Lingwen. I pay my respects to young master Chu Feng.”

The Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master brought the elders of the Starfall Holy Land with him and walked over to Chu Feng. He lowered his back and bent his knees to pay enormous respect to Chu Feng.

“Senior Holy Master, you must not do this. You are my senior, this is unsuitable for one of your seniority. This junior cannot accept it,” Chu Feng said.

“If it’s in accordance with seniority, then it is true that I should not have paid such respect to a person of the younger generation, even if it’s a younger generation from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“However, it is different for young master Chu Feng. Earlier, the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen themselves admitted it. They were planning to capture us so that they could refine our souls.”

“Had it not been for young master Chu Feng saving us, we would all be unable to escape from this calamity. Thus, paying respects to young master Chu Feng would still not be enough to express how grateful I am,” said the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master.

After a short exchange of pleasantries, Chu Feng and the others chatted for a bit. After all, the crowd were all very interested in knowing how Chu Feng had grown to become so powerful.

Seeing that their own paramount Lord Holy Master was actually chatting with Chu Feng with such a respectful look on his face, Song Yunfei felt extremely displeased, whereas Xia Yun’er and the other people of the younger generation were all extremely astonished.

After all, back then, Chu Feng was merely a nameless nobody to them.

They had all deeply looked down on him in the past.

Yet, even their Lord Holy Master was acting so respectfully toward him. As for them... they could only look on from the sidelines, and were unqualified to even interrupt their conversation.

Such an enormous disparity made them feel very uncomfortable and unfamiliar.

As for Chu Feng, he did not continue to chat with the seniors for too long.

He had learned about the terrifying goal of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan, and was very worried about his clansmen.

Thus, after a short conversation, Chu Feng spoke his intentions.

Chu Feng told the people from the Starfall Holy Land and the Ghost Sect Hall to return to the Starfall Holy Stone.

He said that he would set up a spirit formation that would conceal the Starfall Holy Stone so that they could remain safe inside it.

If it was when they had just entered the Void Sacred Tree, the Starfall Holy Land would definitely not agree to hide like that. After all, they would miss out on a rare opportunity.

However, after experiencing what had just happened and learning about the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s terrifying goal, they learned that the Void Sacred Tree was extremely dangerous.

Thus, they gladly accepted Chu Feng’s proposal.

Seeing that he was about to leave, Xia Yun’er’s heart was burning with anxiety. She had finally managed to see Chu Feng again, and deeply wished to speak with him. Yet, she did not know how to start a conversation.

It was instead Chu Feng who noticed her behavior, and looked to her. “Girl, are you free?”

“Ah?” Xia Yun’er was caught somewhat off-guard by Chu Feng suddenly speaking to her. However, once she reacted to what he had said, she immediately nodded repeatedly, “Free, I’m free.”

The Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, who had always acted very natural and unrestrained, had actually lost her composure.

This came as a surprise to all the people that knew her well. However, upon recalling that the person she was answering was a person of the younger generation that was stronger than even their Holy Master, they seemed to be able to understand why she would react like that.

To a greater or lesser degree, they were all able to tell what she thought of Chu Feng.

Besides, the Chu Feng before them was so outstanding.

“Senior Holy Master, if you don’t mind, this junior wishes to bring your Holy Daughter with me for a bit. That said, it will not be too long. Furthermore, I guarantee that she will return safely,” Chu Feng said to the Holy Master.

“Not at all, I don’t mind at all,” the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master not only did not mind in the slightest, but he was even smiling brilliantly. His expression seemed to be stating ‘You’d best bring our Holy Daughter away with you and take her as your wife.’

Then, Chu Feng brought Xia Yun’er to a place that was far from the crowd, yet rather safe.

Chu Feng looked at the beauty beside him, the beauty who women would feel envious toward and men would be completely infatuated with, and sighed emotionally.

Xia Yun’er was truly very beautiful. She possessed both looks, charm and temperament.

However, the reason why Chu Feng sighed emotionally was not due to her beauty. Instead, it was because he was recalling all that had happened between them back then.

“Never would I have expected that you’d be this attentive,” said Xia Yun’er.

“Oh? What do you mean by that?” Chu Feng pretended to be stupid.

“You should’ve detected that it was I who wanted to say something to you. However, I found it embarrassing to open my mouth, so that’s why you deliberately brought me here, isn’t it?” said Xia Yun’er.

“No, that’s not it. It is I who wants to say something to you,” said Chu Feng.

“Is that so? What do you want to say?” A slight look of anticipation appeared in Xia Yun’er’s eyes.

“Thank you for taking care of me back then,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Pfff...” Xia Yun’er mouth widened, and she nearly laughed out loud. Then, she looked at Chu Feng, “Are you certain that I was taking care of you back then and not bullying you?”

“I feel that what you did back then was pretty good. After all, they’ve become my beautiful memories,” Chu Feng smiled as if he was truly reminiscing about the past.

Seeing Chu Feng like that, Xia Yun’er felt very relieved and joyous.

Actually, Xia Yun’er had thought about what Chu Feng would be like when she met him again a lot of times. She had thought about how he would react to her.

She was not afraid that he would become weak, and even less afraid that he would become strong. What she feared was that Chu Feng would become cold and detached toward her.

That was the reason why she felt so relieved and joyous. What she was most worried about did not occur. Chu Feng was still as affable toward her as before. In fact, he was even more friendly to her than before. It was like they were old friends.

“You are truly different from the others,” Xia Yun’er blurted out.
