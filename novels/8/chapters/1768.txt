MGA: Chapter 1768 - Loyal To One’s Friends

At this moment, quietness filled the region. At the moment when the crowd saw with their own eyes that Chu Feng had killed Zhan Qiankun, they all became speechless.

Even though Zhan Qiankun was someone who deserved to die, how many people would actually dare to kill him?

No matter how much others wanted to kill Zhan Qiankun, they only wanted to do it. However, Chu Feng had actually accomplished it. Furthermore, he had killed Zhan Qiankun without any hesitation at all.

“Earlier, there seemed to be a lot of people who wished to kill me. Now that I, Chu Feng, am here, those who wished to attack me do not have to hide anymore. Come, go ahead, attack me,” Chu Feng spread open his arms and ran his gaze over the people below. He had the appearance of telling them to come and attack him.

At this moment, the crowd all lowered their heads in silence. Even those people who had not thought of killing Chu Feng did not dare to look Chu Feng in the face.

While Chu Feng’s gaze was emitting a gentle smile, the chilliness contained within that smile was capable of piercing through their souls.

They were afraid that Chu Feng might misunderstand them. They feared that Chu Feng would think that they had the intention to kill him. To put it simply, they feared that Chu Feng would kill them.

............

All of a sudden, this place that was already silent became eerily quiet. Other than the sound of wind blowing on the grass, only the sounds of heartbeats could be heard.

“If you all do not dare to do anything, then do not speak ill of others behind their backs. You will only ruin your own reputation by doing so,” Chu Feng said. His words were filled with mockery.

Hearing those words, the hearts of the crowd from the Heavenly Law Palace tightened, and their bodies trembled. Chu Feng’s words were aimed at them.

In fact, the people from the Heavenly Law Palace had really planned to take care of Chu Feng. However, that was before. Upon seeing Chu Feng for themselves, they had already given up on that thought completely.

Naturally, there were a lot of people in the Heavenly Law Palace capable of taking care of Chu Feng. However, at the very least, those who were present were not qualified to do so.

“You, elder from the Heavenly Law Palace, say, am I correct or not?” Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly looked to that elder from the Heavenly Law Palace.

Faced with Chu Feng’s question, that Heavenly Law Palace’s elder immediately started to frown. He didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry.

“What little friend Chu Feng said is extremely correct, extremely correct,” Feeling helpless, that Heavenly Law Palace’s elder could only smile uncomfortably.

Not only did he have to smile, he also had to clasp his fist and bow toward Chu Feng very respectfully. He was secretly begging Chu Feng for forgiveness.

The reason why he was acting this way was because he was afraid. He was afraid of Chu Feng. As for why he was afraid, it was because Chu Feng could easily kill him.

Furthermore, he knew that not only did Chu Feng possess the strength to kill him, he also possessed the courage to act upon it.

Faced with such a Chu Feng, he had no choice but to be afraid.

............

Seeing this scene, the crowd all sucked in a mouthful of cold air.

With a single sentence, that Chu Feng had forced that Heavenly Law Palace’s elder into such a state. This sort of situation could be described with a single word -- tyrannical.

“Heh...” Seeing that Heavenly Law Palace’s elder acting this petty and low, Chu Feng laughed disdainfully. Then, his body shifted and he arrived before Jin Wei’e, Yin Wei’e and Tong Wei’e.

“Chu Feng, please don’t misunderstand. We were truly ignorant and inexperienced. We had never heard of your distinguished name. If we had known that you were this powerful, even if we were given ten lives, we would not dare to speak ill of you,” Jin Wei’e, Yin Wei’e and Tong Wei’e who were all seriously injured began to beg Chu Feng for forgiveness repeatedly.

“While it is fine for you all to insult me, I will not tolerate insults toward my friends,” As Chu Feng said those words, he shot forth three palm strikes in succession. “Bang, bang, bang.” Three explosions were heard, and Jin Wei’e, Yin Wei’e and Tong Wei’e all died at Chu Feng’s hands.

Seeing this scene, the crowd gasped in admiration once again. Not only was Chu Feng very powerful, he was also an extremely decisive killer. Furthermore, he was very loyal to his friends. Someone like Chu Feng was extremely rare to come by.

While the people from the Heavenly Law Palace had insulted him, Chu Feng did not kill them. This meant that Chu Feng did not mind others insulting him much.

However, Chu Feng had directly killed Zhan Qiankun, Jin Wei’e, Yin Wei’e and Tong Wei’e. As for the reason why he had done so, it was because they insulted his friends.

“Brother Yan Xie, never would I have thought that we’d see each other again so soon,” After taking care of Jin Wei’e, Yin We’e and Tong Wei’e, Chu Feng arrived before Yan Xie.

“I journeyed far and long to get here for the sake of battling you. However, it would seem... that I have come for nothing,” Yan Xie shook his head while smiling wryly.

After Yan Xie was defeated by Chu Feng, he and Chu Feng had agreed to fight one another again in the future. For the sake of fighting Chu Feng again, Yan Xie had used the Yan Clan’s precious cultivation treasures and cultivation resources, and bore the danger of becoming possessed by the devil to painstakingly train for an entire year. During this period of time, his cultivation had increased by a total of four levels. Originally, he had thought that even if he could not defeat Chu Feng, he would be able to fight against Chu Feng.

However, never had he expected that Chu Feng would have already become a rank seven Half Martial Emperor. There was already no need for him to fight his promised battle with Chu Feng.

“Isn’t it also fine to just see me again?” Chu Feng said with a smile. He was truly very joyous to encounter Yan Xie again here.

“Naturally. However... if I can see you defeat everyone and obtain the title of the ‘Strongest of the Younger Generation,’ it would be even better,” Yan Xie smiled a rare smile.

“Never would I have expected that even you would learn to joke around,” Chu Feng said.

“I’m not joking. Instead, I feel that only you in the current Holy Land of Martialism is fitting of that title,” Although Yan Xie had a smile on his face the entire time, his gaze was extremely serious.

“Come, let me introduce you to my three newly-acquainted friends,” Chu Feng brought Yan Xie with him to Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish.

“This is Yan Xie, the successor of the Flame Emperor. I presume there is no need for me to introduce him anymore,” Chu Feng said to Chili Pepper and the others.

Then, he looked to Yan Xie and pointed at Big Radish and Little Radish, “They are Big Radish and Little Radish. They’re blood brothers.”

Then, Chu Feng pointed to Chili Pepper, “As for this person here, she’s Chili Pepper.”

“I have already experienced Miss Chili Pepper’s abilities. She is extremely brave,” Yan Xie said.

At this moment, Chili Pepper’s face grew red. She lowered her head and grew silent. She was unable to even say anything.

“Yoh, never would I have thought that even Chili Pepper could become embarrassed. Brother Yan Xie, for you to be able to make this girl embarrassed, you’re truly amazing,” Chu Feng teased.

“Chu Feng, she’s not embarrassed because of Yan Xie. Rather, it’s because of you,” Big Radish said with a laugh.

“Big Radish, do you have a deathwish?” Chili Pepper ruthlessly kicked Big Radish. Then, she ran into the spirit formation building she had set up.

Although Chili Pepper had run into the spirit formation building, Chu Feng discovered that Chili Pepper had already removed the spirit formations capable of isolating sight and sound from the outside. Thus, he was able to see that she was stealthily gazing at him while hiding in the building. Furthermore, she had a very satisfied smile on her face.

“Haha, big brother Chu Feng, never would I have expected you to really be Chu Feng. I truly feel extremely lucky to be able to get to know you,” Little Radish said extremely excitedly.

“To become acquainted with me might not necessarily be a good thing for you all,” Chu Feng said those words with a joking tone. However, he was really a bit worried. Naturally, what he was worried about was the Four Great Imperial Clans.

The Four Great Imperial Clans were frantically trying to eliminate Chu Feng. Likely, they would use any means at their disposal in order to capture him.

Chu Feng’s friends would also become their targets. This was the reason why the Cyanwood Mountain had had to sever their relationship with him.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you do not have to be worried about them. The disciples of our Underworld Palace are not people that just anyone can touch.”

“I dare guarantee to you here that our Underworld Palace will ensure their safety,” Right at this moment, that Underworld Palace’s elder who lead the people from the Underworld Palace walked over with a smile across his face.
