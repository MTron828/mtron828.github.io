Chapter 2979 - A Breakthrough Right Now

"Brothers and sisters, as long as there’s someone who is capable of awakening this Flame Extinguishing Pearl for me, I am willing to agree to any condition."

"Even if it’s something that I, Chu Yue, will not be able to accomplish today, I vow to the heavens that I will definitely compensate you for your assistance in the future."

Seeing that no one responded to her cry for help, Chu Yue spoke once again. This time around, she lowered herself even more. In fact, she even spoke of vowing to the heavens that she would compensate them.

It could be seen that she really cared about the opportunity and really wanted to seize it.

Unfortunately, even though she lowered herself like that, no one replied to her, no one answered her.

It was only natural that no one would reply or answer her.

After all, Chu Haoyan was standing there, and Chu Haoyan’s grandfather was also standing there.

If anyone dared to help Chu Yue, wouldn’t they be courting death?

With the situation being like this, Chu Yue became so anxious that the sockets of her eyes started to moisten. She truly did not wish to miss such a grand opportunity.

Seeing Chu Yue so helpless, Chu Feng felt it somewhat unbearable. Unable to contain himself, he said to the crowd, "If anyone is willing to help Chu Yue today, you can make any sort of request. If Chu Yue is unable to honor your request, I, Chu Feng, will honor your request on her behalf."

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd immediately turned restless.

After all, Chu Feng and Chu Yue were completely different. Ever since Chu Feng returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, he immediately revealed his astonishing talent.

Not only had he ascended to the Heavenly Lightning Steps’ legendary tenth step, but he had also revealed his identity as an Asura World Spiritist. Even Chu Haoyan, one of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s strongest geniuses of the younger generation, was completely powerless to retaliate against Chu Feng’s Asura World Spirit.

Chu Feng was simply someone with unbounded potential. Even though he was Chu Xuanyuan’s son, their Chu Heavenly Clan would definitely still place great importance upon his nurture. As such, many people wanted to bring themselves into a relationship with Chu Feng.

“Chu Yue, your interpersonal relationships are truly lacking. There’s actually not a single person in the clan that’s willing to help you. Oh, my mistake, there’s that fellow,” Chu Haoyan looked to Chu Huai, “If I’m not mistaken, you’re called Chu Huai, no?”

“I remember you being quite talented. Why would your cultivation still be so low? Furthermore, you’re incapable of even awakening the Flame Extinguishing Pearl?”

After saying those words, Chu Haoyan looked to Chu Yue again, “Chu Yue, could this be because of you? It seems that those that are close to you will all end up suffering from miserable luck.”

After saying those words, a sneer appeared on Chu Haoyan’s face. It was a sneer filled with malicious intentions, an extremely threatening sneer.

Upon seeing that sneer, the people that were originally thinking about braving the risk to help Chu Yue for Chu Feng all gave up on the thought.

They had weighed the pros and cons. Although they wanted to deepen their relationship with Chu Feng, they still did not want to make an enemy of Chu Haoyan.

After all, Chu Haoyan’s grandfather was their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder, one of the people with the most power and authority in their Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Chuy Haoyan, do you not feel ashamed threatening others like this?” Chu Feng said to Chu Haoyan.

“Threatening? How am I threatening anyone? Don’t you wrongly accuse me of things.”

“Furthermore, even if I am threatening, what can you do about it?” Chu Haoyan looked to Chu Feng with a provocative gaze.

No, it was not only a provocative gaze. His gaze was also filled with deep hatred and grievance.

The hatred Chu Haoyan had toward Chu Feng was already bone-deep. After all, Chu Feng had publicly ruined his reputation.

Chu Feng did not bother to pay attention to Chu Haoyan. He instead turned his eyes to the crowd, “Is there really no one willing to help Chu Yue awaken her Flame Extinguishing Pearl?”

At that moment, the great majority of people lowered their heads. Whilst they did not wish to offend Chu Haoyan, they also did not wish to offend Chu Feng.

“Very well, I’ll do it then,” after Chu Feng said those words, he grabbed the Flame Extinguishing Pearl from Chu Yue’s hand.

“Chu Feng, have you not heard what Lord Youyuan said? A single person is only capable of awakening a single Flame Extinguishing Pearl,” Chu Haoyan said.

Right at that moment, Lord Youyuan said, “Actually, that’s not absolutely the case.”

“Senior, could it be that there are other ways to awaken the Flame Extinguishing Pearl?” At that moment, Chu Feng reacted as if he had seen hope. Humbly, he asked for guidance.

“When we were developing the Flame Extinguishing Pearls, there was someone who managed to awaken two Flame Extinguishing Pearls. The reason why he was capable of doing that is because he managed to reach a breakthrough in cultivation before awakening the second Flame Extinguishing Pearl.”

“Because of that, we did some experiments, and we discovered that one could indeed awaken another Flame Extinguishing Pearl after making a breakthrough in cultivation,” Lord Youyuan said.

“So that’s the case. Thank you for your guidance, senior,” Chu Feng revealed a joyous expression on his face upon hearing those words.

Then, he held the Flame Extinguishing Pearl in hand and said to Chu Yue with a smile on his face, “Big sis Chu Yue, do not worry, I will help you awaken your Flame Extinguishing Pearl.”

“Ah?” Hearing those words, Chu Yue was surprised. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Haha, Chu Feng, did you not hear what Lord Youyuan said?” Right at that moment, Chu Haoyan started to laugh mockingly.

“One can awaken another Flame Extinguishing Pearl after reaching a breakthrough in cultivation, am I wrong?” Chu Feng asked instead of answering.

Hearing those words, the smile on Chu Haoyan’s face froze. Then, he asked, “Could it be that you’re thinking you can reach a breakthrough in cultivation before the Nine Moons Sacred Domain opens?”

“Why can’t I?” Chu Feng asked disapprovingly.

“Humph, you will not be able to accomplish that. Even if you were able to, I can tell you with certainty that you will definitely fail. After all, one must still fuse with the Yin Yang Fate Pearl for the Yin Yang Gate.”

“As for fusing with the Yin Yang Fate Pearl, it’s most definitely not a simple task. One will need at least two days’ worth of time to accomplish that. As such, there would not be enough time.”

Chu Haoyan said those words with a judging tone. It was as if he were announcing to the crowd that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to succeed.

“I understand what you mean. You’re saying that I won’t have enough time to make my breakthrough. In that case, do you think it would be feasible for me to make a breakthrough in cultivation right now?” Chu Feng asked.
