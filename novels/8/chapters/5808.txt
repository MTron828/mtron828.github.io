Chapter 5808: Met With Trouble

Chapter 5808: Met With Trouble

Back then, Sima Xiangtu was able to rob power from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan because he had the backing of a powerful figure in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect named Jiang Jingyu.

Jiang Jingyu never showed his face from the start to the end, but he sent his sons and his subordinates to the Nine Souls Galaxy. It was not a particularly strong line-up, but it was more than enough to cause a huge storm in the Eastern Region.

Jiang Jingyu’s sons were none other than Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai.

Chu Feng had previously defeated Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai.

He was only at Martial Exalted level when he first met Jiang Taibai; the latter had looked so imposing and lofty to him. In particular, he had been awed when Jiang Taibai clashed with the Netherworld Envoy—that was his first time witnessing the strength of a Half-God level cultivator.

Later, he gained control of the Asura World Spirit Army and turned the tables on the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. The person whom he had wanted to kill the most back then was Sima Xiangtu, so he made peace with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, though it was on Jiang Kongping’s account.

He never thought he would meet them here today, though this was probably not just a coincidence. Thus, he showed himself before Jiang Kongping and the others.

Jiang Kongping and the others were already in a flustered state, and it further terrified them when a person dressed in a gray cloak suddenly blocked their path. Jiang Taibai immediately rushed forward to protect Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai.

Jiang Taibai was now at rank three Half-God level; he had advanced his cultivation by a rank since they last met at Nine Souls Galaxy.

Chu Feng couldn’t help but think how the tides had changed. Jiang Taibai, who had been such a huge threat to him back then, was no more than a paper tiger to him now.

He could also clearly perceive the cultivation of the others.

The strongest of the trio was Jiang Taibai, though Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai had grown stronger as well. Both Jiang Kongping and Jiang Yuantai were now at rank one Half-God level, even though Jiang Yuantai was much stronger back then. This showed that Jiang Kongping was indeed the more talented one of the two.

“Who are you?” Jiang Taibai asked with a frown, as he got into an aggressive posture.

Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng took off his cloak and revealed his true face.

“Chu Feng?”

Jiang Taibai and the others immediately recognized Chu Feng. Jiang Kongping was overjoyed, as he began making his way up to Chu Feng. However, the other two immediately stopped him.

While they had made peace in the end, Jiang Taibai and Jiang Yuantai still saw Chu Feng as an enemy. In fact, they had intended to exact vengeance on Chu Feng, and they would have done so if not for Jiang Kongping adamantly dissuading them from doing so.

Naturally, they were guarded against Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing here?” Jiang Taibai grimly asked.

Someone who could suddenly appear in their path without them noticing beforehand had to be an expert, but he didn’t think that Chu Feng could grow that much within such a short period of time. Thus, he discreetly surveyed the surroundings as he thought Chu Feng had a helper.

“Calm down. Our conflict is over,” Chu Feng said as he walked up to them.

Just then, Jiang Yuantai’s aura surged to rank two Half-God level, and he exerted his oppressive might on Chu Feng. He didn’t hurt Chu Feng, but he was threatening Chu Feng to keep his distance.

“Stay there and don’t move, Chu Feng. We aren’t the same as before,” Jiang Yuantai said.

However, Chu Feng persistently approached a step at a time despite Jiang Yuantai’s oppressive might, as if he wasn’t affected by it at all. “Calm down.”

Boom!

Just then, there was another burst of oppressive might. A figure flitted in front of Jiang Yuantai. It was Jiang Taibai.

“Chu Feng, Lord Jingyu is in the vicinity. You’ll be in trouble if you dare to disrespect our young master,” Jiang Taibai sneered.

However, Chu Feng keenly noticed his fear and unease. He shook his head and sighed. “Is there something wrong with your head? Do you not understand human speech anymore?”

Boom!

A tremendous pressure suddenly crushed down on Jiang Taibai and the others, threatening to pop their souls. This oppressive might was from none other than Chu Feng. If he willed so, he could easily obliterate them from the face of the world.

“You... You have reached rank five Half-God level? No... That’s impossible! Is that your world spirit?” Jiang Taibai stared at Chu Feng in disbelief. He found it terrifying that Chu Feng could reach this level of strength, even through his world spirit.

Chu Feng glanced at the others and saw Jiang Taibai and the others staring at him with shocked and horrified eyes. He asked, “Have you been in closed-door isolation in recent days?”

Clearly, Jiang Taibai and the others hadn’t been in touch with the outside world after leaving the Nine Souls Galaxy, or else there was no way they wouldn’t have heard about his affairs. He was the culprit who had caused a mess in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and was proven to be Jie Ranqing’s son, after all!

“Chu Feng, do you know them?” a voice echoed from afar.

Nothing could be seen at the start, but soon...

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Several figures landed behind Chu Feng. It was Little Fishy, Xianhai Shaoyu, Xian Miaomiao, and others. They noticed that Jiang Taibai and the others were from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, but they chose to let Chu Feng deal with it since the latter appeared to be acquainted with them.

While Little Fishy and the others had concealed their appearances with Master Nine Zenith’s gray cloak, it was clear they were no ordinary cultivators judging by the speed of their travel and the impact of their landing.

Jiang Taibai and the others turned pale, as they realized that Chu Feng had helpers. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

All of a sudden, Jiang Kongping broke free of Jiang Taibai’s protection, rushed up to Chu Feng, and grabbed his arm, asking, “Chu Feng, what’s your current cultivation level? How strong are these elders?”

“What’s wrong? Did you meet with trouble?” Chu Feng asked.
