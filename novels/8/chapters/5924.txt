Chapter 5925: Chief World Spiritist Long Moxiao

Chu Feng and Zi Ling had communicated via voice transmission, so Tan Yu couldn’t hear a thing at all. The entity from the Dragon Breath Clan had not yet returned either.

So, Chu Feng turned his attention to the barrier. He found that he could enter the barrier if he utilized some means. Furthermore, he found the barrier oddly familiar too.

“Young friend Chu Feng, I’ve kept you waiting. You are formidable to have restored Tan Yu’s cultivation so quickly. Ah, let Tan Yu excuse himself for a while.” The Dragon Breath Clansmen had finally returned.

“Elder, can you tell me what it is now?” Chu Feng asked.

Unexpectedly, the elder asked, “Chu Feng, you should be able to enter the barrier, right?”

“I have observed the barrier... it should be possible,” Chu Feng replied.

“Come in. Bring your girlfriend with you. It’s a long story, and it’ll be a long talk,” the Dragon Breath Clansmen replied.

“All right. Give me a moment, elder.”

Chu Feng constructed a formation and confirmed that it was possible to enter the barrier via it. Then, he told Tan Yu that he might have to stay here for a while, and the latter could return to the forest first if he didn’t want to wait.

Tan Yu decided to wait for Chu Feng.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling passed through the barrier and entered a formation space.

This formation space exerted a fair bit of pressure on them.

At the entrance of this formation space was a powerful formation. This was the formation that cracked the barrier. If not for this formation, Chu Feng wouldn’t have been able to enter this formation space even if there was a crack in the barrier.

This formation made Chu Feng even more certain that the other party was a powerful world spiritist. At the same time, he noticed that this was no ordinary formation space; they seemed to be inside a protective formation.

To form a formation space within a protective formation, the true master of this place must have been a formidable world spiritist.

“Young friend Chu Feng, we have finally met. What an outstanding youth you are!” an old voice echoed.

Chu Feng looked over and saw a diminutive old man standing in the far distance. The latter was so far away that Zi Ling couldn’t see him. The two of them traveled for some time before Zi Ling finally saw him.

“Why is that elder standing so far away from us?” Zi Ling was confused.

“He’s restricted by a formation. That’s probably the limit of how far he can get to the entrance,” Chu Feng replied.

“Someone that powerful has such restrictions imposed on him? The master of this place must be truly formidable.”

“Yes, he’s likely to be stronger beyond our imagination.”

Amid their chatter, the two of them had already arrived before the old man.

“Young friend Chu Feng, how should I address this young miss?” the old man asked amicably.

“I’m Zi Ling,” Zi Ling replied as she removed her disguise too.

She thought that she should show her true face since Chu Feng had already done so. On the one hand, it was a show of respect for the old man. On the other hand, it was a sign that she would brave any danger with Chu Feng.

Chu Feng understood Zi Ling’s intention, but he didn’t stop her out of respect for her will.

“Aiyo, Miss Zi Ling is gorgeous! Young friend Chu Feng, you sure are fortunate. I have lived for tens of thousands of years, but I have never met such a beautiful lady,” the old man exclaimed with an exaggerated expression.

His exaggerated expression didn’t seem out of place to Chu Feng as he thought that Zi Ling was worthy of it.

“Elder, how should I address you?” Chu Feng asked.

“Call me Long Moxiao. I am the Dragon Breath Clan’s chief world spiritist. I am at rank eight True Dragon,” Long Moxiao replied gleefully.

“Rank eight True Dragon?”

Long Moxiao did have the right to be gleeful, as a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist was comparable to a rank eight True God level cultivator. He was easily one of the most powerful individuals in the world of cultivation.

“Elder, are you trying to leave this barrier through this teleportation formation?” Chu Feng asked.

There was a teleportation passageway forged out of spirit power behind the old man. The teleportation passageway was nearly completed; it just had to be locked in place and activated.

“That’s right.” Long Moxiao nodded.

“Is it feasible?” Chu Feng asked.

“There are risks, but our Dragon Breath Clan wants to leave this place, so we need to give everything a try. In truth, I have been trying to advise my clansmen against this, but my words are falling on deaf ears...

“Our clan follows the majority opinion. Our clansmen don’t want to be trapped here, so they are willing to take risks as long as there’s a chance to escape,” Long Moxiao remarked with a sigh.

Chu Feng understood Long Moxiao’s frustrations. There were significant risks involved here.

“Come come, my two young friends. Follow me.”

Long Moxiao turned around and walked off.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling followed him, only to realize that every step Long Moxiao took was arduous to him in this formation space. This was likely due to the restriction formation on him, or else Chu Feng and Zi Ling would have struggled as well.

However, Long Moxiao seemed to be accustomed to it.

“I wonder who’s behind this,” Zi Ling murmured.

She couldn’t believe that someone could place a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist in such a helpless position.

“The person behind this is formidable. If not for someone once wreaking havoc in this place and leaving behind a crack on the barrier, I wouldn’t have been able to further build on it and transfer my consciousness and items out,” Long Moxiao bitterly replied. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“He’s that incredible?” Zi Ling’s curiosity was further stoked.

“Of course. Young friends, have you heard about the World Spiritist Emperor?” Long Moxiao asked.

“I have,” Chu Feng replied.

“This is one of the World Spiritist Emperor’s domains.”

“No wonder.”

Chu Feng finally understood why this place looked so familiar. This was obviously Qin Jiu’s formation, just that the formation structure was discreet so it took him a while to figure it out.

Zi Ling looked at Chu Feng. The two of them had talked a fair bit since their reunion, so she knew that Chu Feng had obtained the World Spiritist Emperor Qin Jiu’s legacy.
