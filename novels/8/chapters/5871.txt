Chapter 5872: Debt

Chapter 5872: Debt

Chu Feng had depleted his pysche fighting with Jie Tianran that he fainted as soon as he reached the teleportation passageway. In his grogginess, he couldn’t feel anything other than pain. It felt like his head was being shredded, and his body was being pierced by countless needles.

It was a torture even to him.

Some time later, Chu Feng felt a gentle energy enveloping him. His pain swiftly dissipated, and he slowly began to regain his consciousness.

Shortly after, he woke up in a room.

There was a recovery formation around him, and he was lying at its center. However, this recovery formation merely played a supporting role. The energy that healed him came from a skinny figure.

“Wen Xue?” Chu Feng stared at Wen Xue in astonishment.

She had infused her energy into the recovery formation to treat Chu Feng. Her face looked much paler than before, to an extremely sickly degree.

Chu Feng felt conscience-stricken. “Wen Xue, you...”

He never thought that Wen Xue would sacrifice herself to treat him.

“Don’t speak a word,” Wen Xue bellowed ferociously.

She realized that her tone might have been too severe, so she mellowed down her voice and said, “You’re in a weakened state, so don’t speak yet. Just listen. You’re in my master’s sleeping chamber. Zi Ling and my master are outside. I’m only healing you because my master told me to. You need to quickly heal up and head out. That despicable grandfather of yours is preparing to enter the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect again.”

“How long have I been out for?” Chu Feng asked.

“Two hours,” Wen Xue replied.

“Two hours?” Chu Feng was surprised.

The depletion of his psyche had put him in such a terrible condition that it wouldn’t have been surprising for him to be out for months, and that was considering his abnormally fast recovery speed. Others could have easily taken years, decades, or even not made a full recovery in their entire life.

It shouldn’t have been possible for him to regain consciousness in two hours.

It was thanks to Wen Xue that he made such a fast recovery. Wen Xue’s recovery energy was unique. No treasure or natural oddity could emulate the same effect.

Jie Tianran had also depleted his psyche and should have been in a terrible state, but the fact that he was going to attempt to enter the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main gate once more meant that he had a means that allowed him to swiftly recover his strength.

“Of course, you can also back out if you don’t want to go or are not in a good condition to go,” Wen Xue replied.

“Jie Tianran used another observation treasure?” Chu Feng asked.

“Not yet, but he’s likely going to use one. He constructed a sealing formation around the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city. My master deduces that he did that because he figured out that you were previously peeping on him,” Wen Xue said.

“He’s guarding against me. Both our consciousness successfully entered the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city. We ended up pitting our psyche against each other, and that was how I ended up in my current state,” Chu Feng replied.

“I see. No wonder he stopped observing the gates at the same time as you did. Are you going to give it a second try?” Wen Xue asked.

“Are you able to hold on?” Chu Feng asked.

Wen Xue was paying a heavy price for treating him. While he had regained his consciousness, he was still a long way off from returning to his peak. If he wanted to be in his ideal state, Wen Xue would have to fork out a much heavier price.

“Junior Chu Feng, I’ll be frank. I’m treating you with the energy I have accumulated from devouring the bloodlines of others. I’m expending my foundation to help you. Even brothers count their debt. You have repaid me for treating Zi Ling by returning my Life Soul, but this is a fresh debt. How do you intend to repay me for this? It’s going to be an exorbitant debt, and I’ll be the one to call the shots for this,” Wen Xue said.

“I’ll do what you want as long as it doesn’t go against my principles,” Chu Feng said.

“Oh? You’re claiming to be a good person now?” Wen Xue asked.

“I don’t claim to be a good person, but I don’t think I’m a villain either,” Chu Feng replied.

“This means you’re planning to challenge the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city again?” Wen Xue asked.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng replied.

“Do you need to be in your best state?” Wen Xue asked.

“That’s right.”

“Got it. Shut your mouth and rest up. Leave the rest to me, your senior.” Wen Xue formed a hand seal and began infusing a huge amount of psyche into Chu Feng’s body.

This psyche was unique, in the sense that it didn’t belong to Wen Xue but many other people. This was the psyche she had plundered from others.

Individually, their psyche couldn’t compare with Chu Feng’s, but there were so many of them, and Wen Xue had also processed them through a special method, such that they swiftly healed Chu Feng’s depleted psyche.

Chu Feng sat up and formed a hand seal too. He actively accepted the influx of psyche and channeled it around so as to hasten his recovery.

In just a short fifteen minutes, Chu Feng had already healed up by more than half.

However, he wasn’t able to heal to his ideal state, as Wen Xue had reached her limit. She was gasping for air, and she looked as if she was sweating so much that it looked as if she had been soaked under heavy rain. She also looked much thinner than before.

Her head was lowered in exhaustion, and she had to support herself with her hands.

Yet, when she saw Chu Feng getting up, she grabbed him and said, “Get back. I can hold on.”

Chu Feng pried open her hand and placed an invaluable pill onto her palm. “This is enough. Have a good rest. I owe you one.”

With that, Chu Feng walked out of the room. The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and Zi Ling were waiting for him outside.

“Big brother Chu Feng, are you fine now?” Zi Ling rushed forward and asked concernedly.

However, Chu Feng’s face turned awful. He had been planning on returning to the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, but what he saw made him hesitate.

He saw a formidable recovery formation powered by many invaluable treasures, and lying at the center of the formation was the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

The sectmaster was in a terrible state too.

It was only then that Chu Feng finally understood why the sectmaster told him that there was a time limit of two hours. Anything beyond that would put too much of a toll on her.

Zi Ling was not in a good condition either. She must have paid a heavy price to heal her. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Chu Feng, this is a rare opportunity. Hurry up and enter the teleportation formation,” the sectmaster said. Knowing what he was worried about, she added, “I’ll survive. I’m not doing this for you but the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s legacy belongs to our Ancestral Martial Galaxy. It shouldn’t fall in the hands of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. I’m ordering you in my capacity as the sectmaster to head there and claim that legacy!”

“Big brother Chu Feng, enter the teleportation formation. I’ll keep an eye on my master. I won’t let anything happen to her,” Zi Ling urged.

“You mustn’t let anything happen to the sectmaster,” Chu Feng told Zi Ling via voice transmission before entering the teleportation formation.

Chu Feng felt a heavy burden on his shoulders, but that only fueled his fighting will.

He owed a debt to Wen Xue and sectmaster now. He was determined to repay their favors, but above that, he wasn’t planning to disappoint them either.
