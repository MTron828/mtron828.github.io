Chapter 3403 - Destroying An Utmost Exalted With A Single Punch

“Ah?” Hearing that, Wuming Xingyun and the other three immediately became dejected.

Linghu Hongfei had only obtained two spirit formation swords. Furthemore, he no longer had any chance to obtain the remaining three spirit formation swords.

If the number of spirit formation swords one obtained represented one’s chances of success, then with only two spirit formation swords, Ling Hongfei’s chances of success naturally did not appear to be very optimistic at all.

“Don’t be so worried. This time around, the heavens are showing us grace, and have presented with us an unexpected surprise,” as Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke, he turned his eyes to the entrance of the rat zodiac.

Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others also took a glance at the rat zodiac’s entrance following him. However, they still did not understand what Grandmaster Liangqiu meant, and why he was so confident.

However, for some unknown reason, after they saw Grandmaster Liangqiu’s confident and scheming look, the unease in their hearts started to fade away.

As matters stood, they had no choice but to believe in Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Meanwhile, different from the people outside, the geniuses within the grand formation started to panic even more.

Faced with an Utmost Exalted-level monster, even Linghu Hongfei would be defeated instantly. There was simply no hope for victory.

“Big brother Hongfei, what’s wrong?” Linghu Yueyue asked quietly. She who had always been confident and arrogant did not even dare to speak loudly at that moment.

“Everyone, don’t act blindly without thinking. That monster seems to not have noticed us yet. We must not provoke it,” Linghu Hongfei warned the crowd using a voice transmission.

From this, one could tell how alert he was against that thirty thousand-meter-tall colossal monster that pierced through the sky.

That said, the crowd were capable of understanding his alertness.

In actuality, the people of the younger generation within the grand formation were much more panic-stricken compared to Linghu Hongfei.

An Utmost Exalted-level existence was something that could annihilate them with merely a sneeze.

“Big brother Hongfei, something’s amiss with that monster’s foot.”

Suddenly, someone pointed to the colossal monster’s foot.

At that moment, everyone noticed that the space above that monster’s foot was being distorted. Furthermore, spirit power was overflowing from that distorted space. It was a spirit formation gate.

After that spirit formation gate finished taking form, the crowd’s expressions all changed enormously.

The reason for that was because a figure had shot out from the spirit formation gate and smashed into the colossal monster’s foot.

Most importantly, apart from Linghu Hongfei, everyone else present had met that person before.

“Chu Feng, he... why would he suddenly appear here?”

The person who had appeared was none other than Chu Feng.

Upon seeing Chu Feng, not to mention the younger generations within and outside the grand formation, even Liangqiu Chengfeng and the three other Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists were extremely surprised.

The twelve zodiac entrances were clearly the only entrances to the grand formation, so how could Chu Feng appear in the grand formation?

Furthermore, Chu Feng had appeared in the grand formation by opening a spirit formation gate out of thin air.

His appearance was simply too... unreasonable.

At that moment, Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others subconsciously turned their eyes to Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“Continue watching. You’ll understand,” Grandmaster Liangqiu said.

Hearing those words, the four turned their eyes back to Chu Feng.

They had a faint feeling that perhaps Grandmaster Liangqiu’s trump card was the suddenly-appeared Chu Feng.

“What’s going on with that Chu Feng? Why he is covered in injuries?”

Soon, someone discovered that Chu Feng appeared to be in a very bad physical state.

Not only was he covered in injuries, but he was also unconscious.

However, Chu Feng’s injuries were rapidly healing, and he soon regained consciousness.

“Brother, don’t make any sudden movements.”

An impatient voice transmission entered Chu Feng’s ears. It was Linghu Hongfei.

However, even though Linghu Hongfei had warned Chu Feng, Chu Feng reacted as if he had not heard Linghu Hongfei at all. He stood up. However, perhaps because his body was weak and his legs were a bit soft, he immediately fell down on his butt.

Although that colossal monster was extremely large, and its foot was a large as a hill, even though an existence like Chu Feng was akin to a speck of dust before it, and his movements on its foot should not cause the slightest bit of pain to it, the monster actually let out a light roar of pain when Chu Feng’s butt fell on its foot.

Although it was only a light roar, it was louder than the explosions of ten million lightning bolts. The people of the younger generation all felt an ear-piercing sensation from the roar.

Seeing that, the younger generations were all panic-stricken. They all began to send voice transmissions to warn Chu Feng to not make any sudden movements anymore, because they were all afraid that he might end up provoking that monster; causing them to lose their lives.

However, to their surprise, Chu Feng ignored them completely.

However, one could not blame Chu Feng for that.

He had suffered through all kinds of torment in the hidden path. Although he had regained his consciousness, his state of mind was still very hazy. The voice transmissions from the younger generations resembled the buzzing of a bunch of flies.

Besides, there was a special sensation spreading throughout Chu Feng’s body. Chu Feng felt as if his body had undergone some sort of transformation.

Finally, Chu Feng revealed a joyous look in his eyes. Then, he raised his fist, and began to carefully inspect his surroundings.

Linghu Yueyue, Wuming Shengjie, the Liangqiu Sisters, Tantai Xing’er and even Linghu Hongfei. Chu Feng noticed all of them.

Naturally, he also noticed the Utmost Exalted-level colossal monster.

“So that’s the case.”

At that moment, the smile on Chu Feng’s face grew even more intense. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Chu Feng had suffered through torment after torment in the hidden path. At that moment, he finally understood why he had to suffer through all those torments.

Because he had learned the reason, Chu Feng’s body shifted. He actually leaped into the sky, reaching thirty thousand meters into the air and landing on top of the colossal monster.

“This guy, has he gone mad?”

“What the hell is he doing? Can he not hear us?”

The crowd were all panic-stricken upon seeing this scene. The younger generations within the grand formation all turned deathly pale with fear.

That was an Utmost Exalted-level monster. Right now, the only thing on their minds was how to not provoke it.

Yet, Chu Feng’s action was evidently the opposite of what they were considering. He was planning to provoke that monster.

“Chu Feng, quickly, get down. That is an Utmost Exalted-level monster. If you are to provoke it, we will all suffer.”

“Brother Chu Feng, you must not act blindly without thinking. The consequences of your actions will be unthinkable.”

“Chu Feng, what are you doing? Get down here! Otherwise, we sisters will be killed by you.”

With the situation being like that, the crowd had no choice but to continue with their voice transmissions, urging Chu Feng to get down from the colossal monster. Even Linghu Hongfei and the Liangqiu Sisters were urging Chu Feng nonstop.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s awareness had returned to normal. Thus, he was able to clearly hear the crowd’s voice transmissions.

From their voice transmissions, Chu Feng was able to clearly sense the fear of the crowd.

Thus, Chu Feng stood on top of the colossal monster and smiled gently at the crowd. Then, he raised his fist, and made a movement that completely stupefied the crowd.

“Woosh~~~”

Chu Feng’s fist struck down abruptly. Then, a loud ‘bang’ was heard as his fist struck ruthlessly onto the monster.

At that moment, the younger generations within the grand formation were all scared witless. Their faces all turned ashen as despair filled their eyes.

It was not at all an exaggeration to say that they all prepared for death the moment Chu Feng struck the colossal monster.

A bunch of Heavenly Immortals and Martial Immortals provoking an Utmost Exalted-level monster. If this was not courting death, what else could it be?

“Rumble~~~”

However, in the next moment, ear-piercing rumbles could be heard. The colossal monster’s body was actually shattering.

Golden light filled the sky, sprinkling down like torrential rain.

“This... is this for real?!”

witnessing that scene, no one dared to believe their eyes.

The reason for that was because, no matter how one looked at it...

That Utmost Exalted-level monster was... completely annihilated by a single fist strike from Chu Feng!!!
