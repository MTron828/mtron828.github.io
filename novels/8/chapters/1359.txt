MGA: Chapter 1360 - Ailing Matter

“Everyone. I, Ma, am willing to vouch with my entire reputation that this little friend Chu Feng and that little friend Wang Qiang have indeed used the Interference Stones to cheat.”

“Merely, the power of their Interference Stones were limited, and could only be used once. They were only able to be used that one time when the two of them set their impossible records.”

“Thus, when little friend Chu Feng held the Interference Stone and entered the formation to demonstrate to everyone, the Interference Stone had already lost its effect.”

“That was because, during the time of his demonstration, the Interference Stone no longer possessed the power to interfere with the formation,” The Old Village Chief vowed.

“You, you, you’re bull, bullshitting. Do, do you da, dare to allow me to go th, through the formation again? Your da, daddy will strip nu, nude and en, enter without bringing any, anything. I wi, will sti, still only require a sin, single minute to pass through your cr, cra, crappy formation.”

Wang Qiang spoke in anger. As he spoke, he actually started to pull off his large flowery underpants. He was truly planning to strip naked without the slightest hesitation.

“No need, I will not allow you all another opportunity to sully my ancestor’s formation.”

“Men, see the visitors off,” The Lord Village Chief spoke.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh.” After he said those words, the elders who were already beside Chu Feng and Wang Qiang immediately started to act and grabbed Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.

“Re, release me. You bu, bunch of old t, trash wh, who re, refuse to acc, accept your defeat. A po, power that has been in ex, exist, existence for ten th, thousand years? Bu, bullshit! You all ha, ha, have truly dis, disgraced your ancestors,” Wang Qiang began to violently struggle. However, being suppressed by many Half Martial Emperors, there was nothing he could do.

After all, at this time, the people who had captured Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were not limited to only rank one Half Martial Emperors; there were also rank two Half Martial Emperors. The combined strength of the many Half Martial Emperors was extremely frightening. Even though Chu Feng and Wang Qiang possessed heaven-defying battle power, they were still unable to free themselves from the Half Martial Emperors.

“Lord Village Chief,” At this time, Grandpa Song and Granny Lin spoke out together. The two of them wanted to help plead for Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.

The Old Village Chief knew what Grandpa Song and Granny Lin intended to do and so said with a cold voice, “If anyone dares to plead for them, they shall be declared to be accomplices,”

Hearing those words, Grandpa Song and Granny Lin immediately closed their mouths. That was because they knew that this Old Village Chief of theirs was incomparable to Zhou Sitian. Although he was generally very good-natured toward others, when he decided to be ruthless, he would be much more frightening than Zhou Sitian.

“Hahaha...” Right at this time, Chu Feng started to laugh crazily. His laughter was extremely loud, extremely resounding. Like thunder, his intimidating laughter exploded throughout the entire place. Hearing his laughter, even the Half Martial Emperors who had seized him felt scared.

“Wh, what is he laughing about?” At this time, many people from the Sealing Ancient Village started to panic.

As matters stood, even they were uncertain whether Chu Feng had cheated or not. After all, the Old Village Chief refused to present Chu Feng and Wang Qiang the opportunity to prove themselves. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, if they were to truly wrongly accuse Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, then it was likely that the power behind them would not leave matters at that.

Especially with Chu Feng’s laughter that contained a deep sense of anger, it made them feel even more certain that Chu Feng would likely not leave matters at that.

Even though their Sealing Ancient Village had existed for a very long time and was very powerful, with how powerful Chu Feng was, they were certain that the power standing behind Chu Feng was definitely extremely powerful too.

Thus, at this time, the people from the Sealing Ancient Village began to feel an indescribable sense of unease. They feared that Chu Feng would retaliate against them.

“What a Sealing Ancient Village. Today, I finally experienced what it is.”

“Village chief, as the saying goes, the wise man knows he knows nothing, the fool thinks he knows all. I, Chu Feng, did not cheat. We all know in our hearts whether you have wrongly accused us or not.”

“This place is your territory, you possess absolute authority here. However, while you can force us out, you cannot force everyone to believe you to be correct.”

“I, Chu Feng, am not someone who cannot be wrongly accused. However, I am not someone who will accept being wrongly accused. The future is long. This debt today, I will slowly pay back in the future,” Sure enough, Chu Feng spoke. The tone in with which he spoke was filled with anger. He even implied that he would come for revenge in the future.

Chu Feng was really angered. That was because the Sealing Ancient Village had truly disappointed him. Never did he imagine that even the Old Village Chief who possessed a superb reputation would wrongly accuse him.

He knew that it would be extremely difficult for him to remain in the Sealing Ancient Village, that it would be extremely difficult for him to obtain the opportunity to steal the Sealing Glacier.

However, since this was already the case, Chu Feng no longer had dany fear of offending them. And, since he planned to offend them, he decided to completely offend them.

After all, with all these people present, Chu Feng refused to believe that the Sealing Ancient Village would send people to assassinate him after he left.

Chu Feng was certain that the Sealing Ancient Village would not dare to do that. Thus, he dared to say those words. He was saying those words so that everyone would know that he, Chu Feng, had been wrongly accused.

However, he would not just accept it. Sooner or later, he would make the Sealing Ancient Village pay the price for their conduct and deeds today.

In fact, Chu Feng’s words really did manage to possess some deterring power. He had managed to scare a lot of the people from the Sealing Ancient Village.

Although Chu Feng was very young, and his cultivation was only that of a rank five Martial King, anyone with the slightest bit of intelligence would know that Chu Feng possessed an enormous origin and an extraordinary background.

This time around, the Sealing Ancient Village had decided to wrongly accuse Chu Feng and Wang Qiang for the sake of their glory. Their decision was not necessarily wise, because they might have ended up creating two major enemies because of that.

“There’s no need for you to drive me out, I, Chu Feng, will leave myself,” After saying those words, Chu Feng waved his sleeve. He was planning to shake loose the many Half Martial Emperors that had seized him.

However, those elders refused firmly held onto him and refused to give Chu Feng the opportunity to break free.

Right at this time, that Old Village Chief spoke, “Release him, let him leave by himself,”

“Humph,” Merely, Chu Feng did not feel grateful toward the order from the Old Village Chief at all. Instead, he coldly snorted and began to walk to leave.

“Little friend Chu Feng, I am truly sorry. This old man shouldn’t’ have wrongly accused you.”

However, right at this time, a voice transmission entered Chu Feng’s ears. This stunned the extremely angry Chu Feng. That was because this voice was from that Old Village Chief.

At this time, Chu Feng stopped his footsteps. He turned around and looked to that village chief and discovered that the village chief was also looking at him. Furthermore, there was really a trace of faintly discernible apology in his eyes.

“Little friend Chu Feng, although Zhou Sitian is in the wrong, he is the only person in our Sealing Ancient Village other than myself capable of taking on the position of the village chief.”

“I currently have an ailing matter that makes it so that I need to enter closed-door training immediately. As the Sealing Ancient Village is a place that receives guests all year round, we cannot not have an absent person managing it.”

“I know that Zhou Sitian is in the wrong to wrongly accuse you, and that I am even more in the wrong to help him wrongly accuse you. However, I really do not have any other choice.”

“If the truth about what happened today were to be revealed, Zhou Sitian’s reputation would fall to ruin. At that time, it would be impossible for me to pass on the position of the village chief to him. At that time, there will not be anyone managing the Sealing Ancient Village.”

“Thus, for the sake of him being able to smoothly inherit the position of the village chief so that I can enter closed-door training with my mind at rest, I have no choice but to help him wrongly accuse you.”

“However, little friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. I will not make you receive grievances in vain. I will double the prize of the spirit power competition’s first place for you.” Although the Old Village Chief’s mouth did not move, sentence upon sentence of voice transmission entered Chu Feng’s ears.

Those were indeed words from the Old Village Chief. Having reached his level of cultivation, there was simply no need for him to move his mouth to send a voice transmission.

However, this was not the important aspect. The important aspect was that his words were filled with apology.

From those words, Chu Feng was able to tell that while it was true that he had wrongly accused him, he seemed to be different from Zhou Sitian; it seemed that he really had an ailing matter that forced him to do this.
