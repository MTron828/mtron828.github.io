Chapter 4976: Those Who Explored Into the Depths of the Ancient Remnant

The ancient remnant was hidden by a concealment formation.&nbsp;

It was yet another grass field on the other side of the spirit formation gate, looking no different from the scenery outside. The only difference was that there was an entrance made up of old rocks stacked on top of each other that appeared to lead into the underground.&nbsp;

That was likely to be the entrance to the ancient remnant.

“Young hero Chu Feng, hold on for a moment first,” Shengguang Baimei said.

Those words verified Chu Feng’s deduction that he was indeed standing before the entrance into the ancient remnant.&nbsp;

Shengguang Baimei took out two formation keys and undid another two more formations. These two formations were extremely obscure, hinting that the previously Holy Monarch was a formidable world spiritist who had minimally reached God-cloak.&nbsp;

In fact, Chu Feng doubted if an ordinary God-cloak World Spiritist could construct such powerful formations.&nbsp;

If Shengguang Baimei hadn’t dealt with those formations with his formation keys, Chu Feng would have likely fallen prey to them.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I’ve released all of the defensive formations left by our Holy Valley. The entrance isn’t a spirit formation gate, but it has the effect of isolating the place. We aren’t able to get in. You can only rely on yourself from this point onward.&nbsp;

“Remember, don’t push yourself too hard once you’re in there. If you encounter a trial that you aren’t confident of dealing with, you can always turn around and leave. You’re still young and possess great talent; there’ll be plenty of chances ahead of you. This ancient remnant is nonconsequential for you in the long term. It won’t affect your future growth by much,” Shengguang Baimei said.

“Thanks for your advice, elder. I’ll be careful.”

Chu Feng bade Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian farewell before heading into the ancient remnant.&nbsp;

He initially chose to advance carefully, but he soon realized that there were the formation barriers along the way posed little threat. He was able to overcome them with ease.&nbsp;

He initially thought that the later trials would be harder, but he quickly noticed corpses along the underground passageway. They had already been reduced to skeletons, revealing that they had already died for many years.

The items they left behind proved that they were from the Holy Valley.

It was just that there was nothing valuable on them. There wasn’t even a Cosmos Sack on them. Most likely, the others who entered the ancient remnant after him had taken them.&nbsp;

As Chu Feng advanced, the number of corpses swiftly increased. They were all from the Holy Valley. Some of them even had Cosmos Sacks filled with valuable weapons.&nbsp;

Chu Feng stowed away those Cosmos Sacks, but he wasn’t planning to take them for his own. He was intending to return them to the Holy Valley.

After all, these were the possessions of the ancestors of the Holy Valley.

They might have been juniors when they first entered the ancient remnant, but in terms of age, some of them might even be older than the oldest generation of the current Holy Valley.&nbsp;

“It looks like the ancestors of the Holy Valley aren’t too skilled when it comes to world spiritist techniques,” Chu Feng evaluated.

Every single trial of the ancient remnant tested one’s proficiency of world spiritist techniques, be it through concealed formations or clear blockades. All of these posed no challenge to Chu Feng, to the point where he was able to progress smoothly all the way in.&nbsp;

The further he advanced, the more unconfident he felt. It came to a point where he couldn’t see the corpses of the Holy Valley’s ancestors anymore, but he clearly sensed that these formations weren’t being activated for the first time even though they remained completely unblemished.&nbsp;

Someone had triggered these formations before him.&nbsp;

There were only two possibilities.

There was an outstanding ancestor from the Holy Valley that managed to overcome many of the trials. Other than that, it was also possible that someone else other than a member of the Holy Valley had challenged this ancient remnant.

It was one thing if these formations were challenged by an ancestor of the Holy Valley, but if it was someone else, there was a good chance that the heritage might not be there anymore.

The formations in the ancient remnant would automatically reactivate shortly after being cleared, and they would remain active even after someone took away the heritage.

It would be a huge tragedy if someone had taken away the heritage, not just for Chu Feng but the ancestors of the Holy Valley. It would mean that they had died in vain.

Of course, this was just a conjecture on Chu Feng’s part.&nbsp;

Even if the one who cleared the formations wasn’t from the Holy Valley, there was no guarantee that he had reached the end of the trial. There was only one way to find out the truth, and that was for Chu Feng to clear the entire ancient remnant himself.&nbsp;

Around two hours after entering the underground passageway, Chu Feng’s footsteps suddenly screeched to a halt. A slight furrow formed on his forehead.&nbsp;

He was feeling a little frustrated

There was a pair of massive stone gates in front of him, and both of them had formations constructed on them. It would take a great deal of effort to open the gates.&nbsp;

“Things don’t look good.”

The more Chu Feng examined the gates, the deeper his frown became.&nbsp;

“What’s wrong?” Yu Sha asked.&nbsp;

“It’s nothing.”

Chu Feng decided not to say anything for the time being and focus his effort on deciphering the formation. However, his heart was already feeling incredibly heavy.

He could tell that the formations constructed on the gates were different from the ones he had cleared before. They were at least several times harder.&nbsp;

Under normal circumstances, this pair of gates should be the final trial, meaning that the heritage was waiting behind the gates.&nbsp;

Yet, he hadn’t discovered the corpse of the person who cleared all of the formations before.&nbsp;

There were only two possibilities here.

One, that person had died behind this pair of gates.&nbsp;

Two, that person had successfully obtained the heritage and left the ancient remnant.

It would be a huge tragedy if it was the latter.&nbsp;

Chu Feng wasn’t too concerned about making a wasted trip since these formations didn’t pose much of a challenge to him. He hadn’t lost much by challenging this trial.&nbsp;

What he was more concerned about were the ancestors who had died in vain here.&nbsp;

He thought about the countless corpses he had encountered along the way, and he couldn’t help but lament how so many talents of the Holy Valley had lost their lives for a heritage that didn’t even exist. He felt that it was a huge pity even though he wasn’t a member of the Holy Valley.&nbsp; ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He couldn’t imagine how Shengguang Baimei and the others would feel when they learned about this.&nbsp;

In any case, Chu Feng would have to decipher the formations and open the gates to uncover the truth. He started working on the formations, and the stone gates started to tremble violently.&nbsp;

He eventually managed to decipher the formation, and the tightly shut stone doors slowly opened.&nbsp;

“That is…”

As the crack in the stone doors widened, Chu Feng froze in place. He noticed a silhouette standing behind the stone gates.&nbsp;

While he was looking at the other party, the other party was looking at him too.

It wasn’t a corpse but a real living being.
