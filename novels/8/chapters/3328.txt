Chapter 3328 - Refusal

Once Liangqiu Chengfeng said those words, the crowd’s expressions all changed. Then, they smiled at ease.

It turned out that the crowd were not at all surprised by Liangqiu Chengfeng’s desire to take Chu Feng as his disciple.

After all, he had revealed his fondness and appreciation of Chu Feng’s talent over the entire journey.

That said, the crowd still felt joyous and excited for Chu Feng after hearing those words coming from Liangqiu Chengfeng’s mouth.

With the status that Liangqiu Chengfeng possessed, if Chu Feng were to become his disciple, who would possibly dare to make things difficult for the Chu Heavenly Clan in the future?

Most importantly, Liangqiu Chengfeng had never accepted a disciple.

If Chu Feng was willing, he would become Liangqiu Chengfeng’s first and possibly only disciple. That honor was something yearned for by countless numbers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations day and night.

"Senior, thank you for your fondness of this Chu Feng. Merely, I am truly apologetic.”

“This junior has once pledged before that I will never respect another person as my master. For that oath, this Chu Feng has refused many seniors. Thus, today, I can only refuse senior’s kind intentions,” Chu Feng bowed to Liangqiu Chengfeng with an apologetic expression on his face.

“This...” The crowd present were all extremely surprised by Chu Feng’s response.

While they had anticipated the possibility that Liangqiu Chengfeng might accept Chu Feng as his disciple, they had never imagined that Chu Feng would actually reject Liangqiu Chengfeng.

Chu Feng’s response was truly unexpected.

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief felt even greater astonishment. He had thought that Chu Feng would definitely agree to become Liangqiu Chengfeng’s disciple.

After all, he knew the Chu Heavenly Clan better than others, and knew how much the current Chu Heavenly Clan needed Liangqiu Chengfeng’s backing.

Thus, he was truly surprised by Chu Feng’s refusal.

“Haha. Very well. It would appear that young friend Chu Feng is a man of principle.”

“Since that’s the case, this old man will not force you to do something you’re unwilling to,” surprisingly, Liangqiu Chengfeng did not show too much surprise at Chu Feng’s refusal. Instead, he laughed in an undisturbed manner.

That said, there was still a trace of disappointment in his eyes.

The crowd were also all able to sense Liangqiu Chengfeng’s disappointment.

Liangqiu Chengfeng had never taken a disciple in his entire life. The reason for that was because he had an extremely high demand for the talent of his disciple.

He’d taken the initiative to ask Chu Feng to become his disciple. That was sufficient to prove how much he had acknowledged Chu Feng’s talent.

Unfortunately, no one expected that Liangqiu Chengfeng would actually be refused the first time he asked someone to become his disciple.

If the person who had refused Liangqiu Chengfeng were someone else, they would definitely curse that person out for being unable to determine what was good for them.

However, as it was Chu Feng, the crowd, while surprised, were able to accept it.

After all, Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan’s son. With such a father behind his back, there was indeed no need for him to become the disciple of anyone else.

Besides, the crowd did not know Chu Feng very well either. For example, there were those two demonesses from earlier, two Utmost Exalted-level existences.

Although Chu Feng was filled with hostility toward them, they were willing to protect him. This sort of confusing relationship caused the crowd to realize that Chu Feng possessed some sort of extraordinary experience.

As such, Chu Feng possessed the qualifications to refuse Liangqiu Chengfeng.

Afterwards, the crowd did not linger on the topic excessively. Instead, they returned to how they were before.

After chatting for some time, the people from the various powers all left in succession. Liangqiu Chengfeng also left with the Liangqiu Sisters. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had not left with Chu Feng. He seemed to have something that he wished to discuss with the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

At that moment, Chu Feng and the others were still outside the Ancient Era’s remnant. However, Chu Feng was arranged to stay in an isolated palace.

Chu Feng did not rest. Instead, he stood on top of the palace with a serious expression, grief-filled eyes and a downcast posture.

He was feeling depressed about the matter regarding the Moon Immortal.

Back when the Moon Immortal was in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, she was indeed a peak-level expert. However, it remained that that was in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

As for the place that they were in presently, it was the Ancestral Martial Starfield. The experts there were not existences that the people from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm could compare to.

That was especially true for the power of the spirit formation that Chu Feng had grasped back then. It was so strong that it could obliterate everyone, including even Liangqiu Chengfeng.

Chu Feng had felt overjoyed when he saw the Moon Immortal. He had thought the heavens were helping him.

After all, the Moon Immortal had just so happened to appear at the location where the spirit formation’s power he had grasped could be used. With the power of the spirit formation, he would be able to retrieve Su Rou and Su Mei.

At that moment, he had truly thought that it was the will of the heavens.

However, never did Chu Feng imagine that the power of the spirit formation, although extremely mighty, was unable to withstand a single attack from the Moon Immortal.

Chu Feng had failed. His failure made him realize that the Moon Immortal was much stronger than he had anticipated.

Utmost Exalted realm. Although Chu Feng had no idea how the Moon Immortal had gained such strength, it remains that she possessed the cultivation of an Utmost Exalted expert, and had left Chu Feng far behind her.

How was Chu Feng supposed to chase after such a Moon Immortal? What must he do in order to retrieve Su Rou and Su Mei?

The feeling of being weak and powerless was spiraling through every nook and corner of Chu Feng’s body, bringing him enormous pain.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, an enormous power covered Chu Feng’s surroundings and sealed him off like a spirit formation barrier.

“Who is it?!”

Sensing that power, Chu Feng became nervous.

Chu Feng knew that what had sealed him was not spirit power. Instead, it was the power of a powerful cultivator.

Being isolated by that power, no one knew that Chu Feng was here, or that he had been sealed off.

Most importantly, for that person to possess such overwhelming power, it meant that that person also possessed the strength to obliterate Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had been caught in deep danger.

However, right after Chu Feng became nervous, joy immediately covered his face.

The reason for that was because two figures had appeared before him. Basked by moonlight, those two individuals appeared exceptionally beautiful, exceedingly extraordinary and refined. They truly resembled celestial faeries that had descended upon the mortal world.

As for those two individuals, they were none other than Su Rou and Su Mei.

“You didn’t leave?” Chu Feng analyzed in a joyous manner. Even though he knew that it was the Moon Immortal that he was confronting, he was still feeling very joyous.

After all... this meant that he, at the very least, still had a chance to talk with the Moon Immortal and potentially gain an understanding of what she planned to do. He would be able to inquire about the safety of Su Rou and Su Mei, and learn things that he didn’t know.

“I naturally would not leave. After all, I will have to provide you with a proper explanation.”

The Moon Immortal’s voice was heard. However, the moment her voice left her mouth, Chu Feng’s body grew stiff. He was overwhelmed with emotions.

Even his body was trembling.

He had discovered that Su Rou and Su Mei’s gaze had changed.

At that moment, the two people standing before him were no longer occupied by the Moon Immortal.

Instead, they were his two beloved, the familiar Su Rou and Su Mei.
