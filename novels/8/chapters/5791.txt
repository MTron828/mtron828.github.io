Chapter 5791: The Side Effect of the Bloodline Skill

“Wuu!”

A voice drew away the crowd’s attention from the scenery outside. It was from Chu Feng.

“Big brother, you’re awake.”

“Chu Feng, how are you feeling? Any discomfort?”

Little Fishy, Xian Miaomiao, and the others rushed forward. Chu Feng opened his eyes upon hearing their voices, but he was in a terribly weakened state.

“I’m fine. I’m just feeling very weak at the moment. I’ll need some time to recover,” Chu Feng replied.

By now, he had already confirmed the side effect of Bloodline Skill: Lightning God Bestowment. It was similar to the bloodline power he had grasped when he lost control of his emotions after nearly losing Eggy, in the sense that it raised his fighting prowess by a cultivation rank, but this increment couldn’t be felt by others.

Chu Feng, with his base cultivation of rank five Half-God level, could rival rank eight Half-God level cultivators after unleashing the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings. With the enhancement of his bloodline power, he could match a rank nine Half-God level cultivator.

With the Lightning God Bestowment, he could further raise his fighting prowess by another rank.

If he unleashed Lightning God Bestowment, that would further raise his fighting prowess by a rank.

His increment was different from the others.

For instance, Xianhai Shaoyu was a rank seven Half-God level cultivator who could raise his cultivation rank three times, so he was stronger than rank nine Half-God level cultivators, though it was nowhere near a True God level cultivator yet.

Under the same logic, Chu Feng, who was at rank five Half-God level and could raise his cultivation five times, should have been the same as Xianhai Shaoyu, in the sense that he would be stronger than rank nine Half-God level cultivators but nowhere near True God level.

Yet, that wasn’t the case at all.

The God Lightning Bestowment actually allowed him to overcome his bottleneck. If he activated God Lightning Bestowment when his fighting prowess was at rank nine Half-God level, he could overcome his limitations and reach rank one True God level.

That was why he could defeat Huangfu Shengyu, whose fighting prowess was at rank one True God level.

However, there was a price to be paid for utilizing such terrifying power—he would experience extreme weakness and even temporarily pass out. Even so, this was a price he could accept.

“What are those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion doing?” Chu Feng asked. Even though he was lying on the ground, he could still see what was going on outside through the spirit formation gate.

“My big brother says that those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion are trying to conquer the Genesis Bloodline,” Little Fishy replied.

“Oh?” Chu Feng chuckled.

“Brother Chu Feng, are you able to pass through the spirit formation gate and conquer the Genesis Bloodline?” Long Chengyu asked.

“I can do that,” Chu Feng replied.

“You should quickly make a move then. Don’t let the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion beat you to it,” Long Chengyu replied.

“No rush.” Chu Feng chuckled. “I wouldn’t want to miss watching the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion making a joke out of themselves, and I need some time to recover too.”

“Making a joke out of themselves?” The crowd was taken aback.

“There’s no way they could conquer the Genesis Bloodline. They’re just going to embarrass themselves with this attempt,” Chu Feng remarked. He sat upward and took two pills before closing his eyes to condition his state.

“…”

The crowd turned to Ling Xiao and Jie Baobao, feeling worried about how they would respond since they were from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. However, the two of them showed no reaction at all.

Chu Feng healed quickly. Soon, he opened his eyes and looked outside, where he saw the formation constructed by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion nearing completion.

“They still aren’t done yet? How slow,” Chu Feng remarked.

He could tell that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had prepared the formation beforehand, such that the foundation was in place by the time they displayed it to the crowd. Even so, they were still taking a long time to complete the formation.

“Where’s Huangfu Jiangyao and the others?” Chu Feng asked.

“I killed them. I took their treasures too since I was the one who dealt with them. I hope you don’t mind,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“Of course I don’t mind,” Chu Feng replied. He understood Xianhai Shaoyu’s drift.

Those present here appeared to be on the same front, but this alliance was only temporary. Ultimately, they had different loyalties. There was no guarantee that someone wouldn’t spread the word about this matter in the future. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

There was no question that Xianhai Shaoyu deserved those treasures since he was the one who dealt with those two, but more than that, he took them because he wanted to shoulder the burden too. He didn’t kill the other two Huangfus on Chu Feng’s behalf; he did it because he wanted to.

This meant that Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu bear equal responsibility. If the Huangfu Heavenly Clan wanted vengeance, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan would stand on Chu Feng’s side.

Chu Feng took all of Huangfu Shengyu’s treasures into his Cosmos Sack, including his God Armament.

“Brother Chu Feng, what did you do earlier? How were you able to deal with the rank one True God level Huangfu Shengyu when your cultivation was only at rank eight Half-God level?” Long Chengyu was burning with curiosity.

The crowd turned their attention to Chu Feng. They had their guesses, but they wanted to hear Chu Feng’s answer.

“That is a secret. It’s my trump card,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle. “Please keep it a secret for my sake. I also hope that you can keep Huangfu Shengyu and the other Huangfus’ death and Miaomiao’s powers confidential. If anyone reveals information here that brings trouble to me or my friends, I’ll definitely root you out and deal with you. Don’t blame me for being vicious.”

Chu Feng specifically eyed Qin Xuan, Ling Xiao, Jie Baobao, and the others from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion when he said those words. He had a favorable impression of most of them after the earlier events, but all of them had different loyalties, after all.

“Chu Feng, I, Qin Xuan, would have been dead if not for you. Rest assured. I’ll definitely keep it a secret,” Qin Xuan replied.

“I’ll also keep it a secret,” Yuwen Yanri said, followed by the others from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion.

Boom!

There was suddenly a deafening explosion outside. The colossal formation had finally been completed, and it was emanating a tremendous amount of power that converged on a single individual.

The crowd was stunned, for that individual was none other than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master. He was seeking to channel the formation’s power to conquer the Genesis Bloodline.

The crowd subconsciously turned to Chu Feng, thinking that the latter would lose control of his emotions. To their surprise, Chu Feng remained composed, even more so than any of them.
