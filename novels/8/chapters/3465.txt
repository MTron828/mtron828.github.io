Chapter 3465 - Focused ous Crowd Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At that moment, the great majority of the crowd were feeling very excited and emotional.

That said, there was also a small portion of them that were feeling nervous.

The ones feeling nervous were not only the people of the younger generation with status and fame. The seniors and elders of those younger generations were also nervous.

After all, if they were able to inscribe their names onto that Apex Pillar, it would not only be a great honor to the younger generations themselves, but it would also bring honor to their entire clan.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Finally, that old man raised his writing brush.

The enormous writing brush moved back and forth rapidly in his hand. Soon... two large characters were inscribed onto the Apex Pillar.

When those two large characters appeared, everyone present was stunned.

The previously noisy surroundings became incomparably quiet, strangely quiet.

“Clamor~~~”

After a moment of utter silence, the crowd all burst into an uproar.

Confusion, astonishment, surprise and all kinds of complicated emotions filled the crowd.

The crowd were unable to understand, because the two characters that were inscribed onto the Apex Pillar, the name that was inscribed onto the Apex Pillar... was not a name that they were expecting. Instead, it was a name that they had never thought of.

Chu Feng!!!

The name that replaced Linghu Hongfei on that Apex Pillar was Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng?”

“Who’s Chu Feng?”

“Never have I heard of such a person, how could that person replace Linghu Hongfei?”

“Am I ignorant and ill-informed, what the heck is going on?”

..........

......

....

The crowd all felt strong feelings of dissatisfaction toward the name Chu Feng. Although they did not dare to call the Starfield Master Realm’s decision into question, they reacted in a confused manner, and called Chu Feng’s capability into question.

Compared to the astonished crowd, Chu Feng reacted in a very calm manner. He was extremely calm the moment he saw his name inscribed onto the Apex Pillar. The reason for that was because he still had yet to associate the name with himself.

“Congratulations, young master Chu Feng,” suddenly, Tantai Xing’er, who stood beside Chu Feng, congratulated him.

“Ah?” Chu Feng only managed to react upon hearing those words. Turned out, that Chu Feng was him?

Upon reacting to what had happened, Chu Feng immediately looked towards Wuming Xingyun.

Chu Feng did not have many dealings with the Starfield Master Realm. In fact, the only people from the Starfield Master Realm that Chu Feng knew so far were Wuming Xingyun and Wuming Fenghuo.

Thus, Chu Feng felt that it was very likely because of Wuming Xingyun, that his name was inscribed onto the Apex Pillar.

“Young friend Chu Feng is also qualified to take on this honor,” sensing Chu Feng’s gaze, Wuming Xingyun looked back at him with a beaming smile.

At that moment, Chu Feng was certain that the present situation was related to Wuming Xingyun.

In fact, such an outcome was indeed brought about by Wuming Xingyun. When they were still in the Tantai Heavenly Clan, Wuming Xingyun wrote a secret letter to his clansmen in charge of the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars. That letter recommended Chu Feng as the replacement for Linghu Hongfei, to take his place on the first ranked Apex Pillar.

At that moment, the people on the Tantai Heavenly Clan warship had verified that the Chu Feng inscribed onto the Apex Pillar was the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Feng.

Actually, they were all able to understand it. After all, Wuming Xingyun had stated earlier that Chu Feng would be unrivaled in the upcoming selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

Based on Wuming Xingyun’s status within the Starfield Master Realm, if he wanted to replace Linghu Hongfei’s name with Chu Feng’s name, it could naturally be done very easily.

However, the vast crowd outside were still filled with great suspicions toward Chu Feng’s name.

They had naturally linked the name Chu Feng with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Feng, the son of Chu Xuanyuan. However, their association only lasted but an instant.

After all, for the great majority of the people, still believed the rumor that Chu Feng had died.

Furthermore, they also knew that Chu Feng was trash with no talent for martial cultivation.

As such, they would naturally not associate the person who had replaced Linghu Hongfei with that trash.

In fact, even the people that knew Chu Feng was still alive couldn’t be certain whether or not that Chu Feng was the Chu Feng that they knew.

For example, there was the Gong Heavenly Clansmen.

Amongst the Gong Heavenly Clan, the person feeling the most complicated would be none other than Gong Mingyue.

After seeing the name Chu Feng, waves started to surge in her heart, making her restless.

“Big sister, say, do you think that Chu Feng might be my future brother-in-law?” Gong Qing, who stood beside Gong Mingyue, asked.

Gong Qing naturally knew that there was a deep conflict between Chu Feng and Gong Mingyue.

However, Gong Qing felt that Chu Feng was a very decent person, and that her big sister only had some sort of misunderstanding with him. Thus, she had been trying her best to persuade Gong Mingyue, as she really wanted Chu Feng to become her brother-in-law.

“That’s impossible. It couldn’t possibly be him. With how weak he is, how could his name be inscribed onto the Apex Pillar? Not to mention replacing Linghu Hongfei on top of that?”

The people of the younger generation beside them immediately refuted Gong Qing.

However, Gong Mingyue did not say anything. She had started to ponder deeply about the matter.

‘Could it really be him? Is his background truly so powerful that even the Starfield Master Realm will give him face?’

‘But, wasn’t the Chu Heavenly Clan a Heavenly Clan that had fallen from power?’

Questions filled Gong Mingyue’s heart. At the same time, she felt very uneasy.

Being intelligent, she felt that since Tantai Xing’er had valued Chu Feng so greatly, the Starfield Master Realm might also end up valuing Chu Feng greatly too.

However, the more she knew of the possibility of such a thing happening, the more upset she felt.

She had actually looked down on someone that even Tantai Xing’er and the Starfield Master Realm valued. That was simply too laughable.

“The selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars will soon begin. Those whose names are on the Apex Pillars, please ascend the pillars!!!”

Right at that moment, the old man holding the enormous writing brush suddenly spoke out loudly.

After his voice sounded, many figures began to fly towards the Apex Pillars.

Linghu Yueyue, Linghu Tiemian, Tantai Xing’er and the others ascended their Apex Pillars in succession. Even Wuma Shengjie, under the crowd’s cheers, ascended onto her Apex Pillar.

However, when Chu Feng appeared, the cheers that had filled heaven and earth came to an abrupt stop.

“Who the heck is that? That’s Chu Feng?”

“How come I’ve never seen him before?”

The people that did not know Chu Feng all felt completely lost.

As for the people that knew Chu Feng, their reactions were even more intense.

“It really is him?!”

Even though Gong Mingyue had prepared for it, she was still completely astonished upon verifying it to be true. A complicated expression filled her beautiful eyes.

At that moment, the fiance that she looked down on was standing atop the first ranked Apex Pillar, and was the focus of an enormous crowd of hundreds of millions.

As for her, she could only remain in the sea of people, and be of no interest to anyone.
