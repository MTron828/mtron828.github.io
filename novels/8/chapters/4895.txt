Chapter 4895: Settling the Scores

Shengguang Xintian was conflicted, but she eventually decided to back down silently.

She had chosen to compromise here, but it was not because Chu Feng was a dangerous person whom she couldn’t hope to control. Those traits were actually the reason why she had become interested in Chu Feng. She wouldn’t have had such a high opinion of him if that was not the case.

She was compromising not over what kind of person Chu Feng was but what kind of person she was.

She was a member of the Holy Valley.

Despite her admiration for Chu Feng, she couldn’t possibly do something detrimental to the Holy Valley over someone she had just met. Even if it was wrong and immoral, she wouldn’t go against the Holy Valley’s decision, not to mention that this decision was made by her grandfather.

Shengguang Xintian descended to the ground, crossed her legs, and continued cultivating.

The other juniors also followed suit.

It was only till they couldn’t feel any fortune in the air anymore did they finally open their eyes. This was a sign that their cultivation had come to an end.

They rose to their feet with joyful looks on their faces. Some of them even began discussing excitedly with one another.

None of them managed to make a breakthrough in their cultivation, but they had managed to comprehend something that was related to martial cultivation. While this comprehension wouldn’t grant them an epiphany right away, it would pave the way for their future cultivation.

To put it in another way, the invisible ceiling capping their future accomplishment had been released. Some of them might have reached their limits at rank six Martial Exalted level in their lifetime, but the cleansing, trial, and fortune had elevated their soul to a new level, opening new windows to them.

Even if they couldn’t reach pinnacle Martial Exalted level in the future, it shouldn’t be too difficult for them to reach rank seven or rank eight Martial Exalted level.

They were satisfied with the results.

“A full bloom does make a huge difference. It wasn’t a wasted trip,” Shengguang Chuyao remarked.

He wasn’t able to make a breakthrough, but he knew just how valuable the gains he had made today were.

However, there were two people with grim looks on their faces. One was Shengguang Xintian and the other was Shengguang Menglai.

Shengguang Xintian had an awful complexion due to Chu Feng. Even the huge gains she had made here weren’t enough to lift her spirits.

On the other hand, Shengguang Menglai’s attitude was really perplexing.

“Menglai, what’s wrong?” Shengguang Chuyao asked.

“Is Chu Feng dead by now?” Shengguang Menglai asked.

“Did Chu Feng really lose his energy in the cultivation realm? Is it possible that there are other fortuitous encounters inside the spirit formation gate?” Shengguang Chuyao asked. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I grasped that energy earlier on too, so I have some understanding of this cultivation realm too. Behind the spirit formation gate is an ordinary cavern with no fortuitous encounter,” Shengguang Menglai said.

“If that’s the case, Brother Chu Feng... is unlikely to survive this ordeal. Haoxuan wouldn’t spare him.”

Shengguang Chuyao’s voice sounded a little regretful, but he wasn’t too upset about it. He had principles, but above that, he was also a member of the Holy Valley too.

If a junior of the Holy Valley had gone after Chu Feng for no good reason, he would have sided with Chu Feng. However, if the Holy Valley had deemed Chu Feng to be a threat and decided to get rid of him, he would back the Holy Valley’s decision.

“If not for Chu Feng, we wouldn’t have been able to enter the Holy Lotus Tree. Be it in terms of talent, discernment, judgment, decisiveness, or means, none of us is a match for him at all. He’s truly a formidable individual,” Shengguang Menglai remarked.

She wasn’t feeling upset over Chu Feng’s death. She just thought that it was a pity.

Everyone would have been shocked by Shengguang Menglai’s evaluation had she said such words prior to entering the Holy Lotus Tree. They saw Shengguang Menglai as someone chosen by heaven, destined to rise to the top. They couldn’t imagine anyone to be even more talented than Shengguang Menglai.

But none of them were disagreeing with Shengguang Menglai’s evaluation now.

It was just that the evaluation was meaningless now.

Chu Feng had indeed crushed them to the point that they couldn’t even lift their heads earlier on. In fact, had he not gotten soft-hearted and spared their lives, he could have just massacred them earlier on. If so, he wouldn’t have ended up getting killed by Shengguang Haoxuan.

“He’s already dead. What’s the point of lamenting over this? Chu Feng doesn’t look like a bad person. Even if it’s my grandfather’s order, I have to clarify with him why he wants to kill Chu Feng,” Shengguang Xintian bellowed furiously.

She leaped to her feet and thrust her fist forth.

Boom!

The golden barrier surrounding the spirit formation gate shattered into pieces.

It was not that she couldn’t break this golden barrier earlier. It was just that she chose to step down. She was only breaking this barrier now because she thought that it was unlikely for Chu Feng to survive the ordeal. If so, she wouldn’t want to stay here any longer...

After breaking the barrier, she leaped into the spirit formation gate.

The crowd turned to look at Shengguang Menglai.

“Let’s go. I also want to know why our Holy Valley wishes to get rid of Chu Feng, as well as what his background is.”

Shengguang Menglai leaped into the spirit formation gate, and the other juniors quickly followed suit. Soon, they found themselves arriving in a cavern.

The cavern wasn’t too huge. At the end of the cavern was another spirit formation gate, just that this gate was in a closed state.

However, the moment they arrived at the cavern, Shengguang Menglai and the others froze up in shock.

They saw a person sitting in front of the closed spirit formation gate—Chu Feng.

Chu Feng wasn’t dead yet. To be more exact, he was unharmed.

However, what was more shocking was that he was sitting on top of a person.

That person was in a tragic state. His limbs were severed, and his body was filled with bloodied holes. His face was disfigured, and his eyes had been clawed out. He was still alive, but there was no doubt that he was already on his last breath.

He was still conscious, evidenced by his miserable groans. It was just that he was too weakened that his voice could hardly be heard.

Despite his disfigured appearance, the crowd was still able to recognize him by his clothes. That person was none other than Shengguang Haoxuan.

“You all sure kept me waiting. It’s about time to settle our scores.”

Chu Feng looked at the juniors of the Holy Valley with a terrifying smile. His eyes were so cold that the crowd felt their hearts lurching. A chilling sensation was slowly gripping their hearts.
