Chapter 3514 - Honor

“Ruochu, you’re beating around the bush here. We’re asking about Chu Feng, not... wait, what did you just say? Who? Who did you say Chu Feng had the same ranking as?”

“Linghu Hongfei, of course,” said Li Ruochu.

“You’re saying that Chu Feng also obtained the first ranked place of the Ancestral Martial Decastars like Linghu Hongfei? How could that be possible?” The Li Heavenly Clansmen felt disbelief.

Their reaction was understandable. Whilst they would most definitely believe it had Li Ruochu said that Chu Feng had defeated someone else, for her to say that it was Linghu Hongfei, they found it too exaggerated.

This was especially true for Li Anzhi and the others. Not long ago, they were able to contend against Chu Feng. Yet now, he was already able to stand on equal footing with Linghu Hongfei. How could they possibly believe this to be true?

Exactly what sort of growth must one have to achieve such rapid progress?

Most importantly, in the history of the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, there had never been an instance where two people simultaneously held the first ranked spot.

Everything was simply too unbelievable and fantastic. That said, their reactions of disbelief was understandable. Anyone would feel disbelief in their shoes.

“The match lasted for ten days and ten nights without an outcome. Furthermore, since no one else dared to challenge the two of them, the two of them are naturally both ranked first.”

Seemingly knowing that the crowd were confused, Li Ruochu not only explained what had happened, but she even deliberately emphasized, “The selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars has concluded. Soon, news regarding it will spread. At that time, everyone will know what happened even without me telling you.”

Hearing that, although the crowd still found it extremely unbelievable, they had no choice but to believe her. It was as she had said, she could not deceive them in something like this.

Even if she could deceive them momentarily, they would find out the truth eventually. Besides, they were unable to find any reason as to why she would deceive them.

That said, after they found themselves having no choice but to accept her words, their feelings grew even more complicated.

It turned out that the person who was helping their Li Heavenly Clan right now was not only a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, but he was also the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generation with the strongest talent, the first ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

But, wasn’t Chu Feng someone who was nearly defeated by Li Anzhi back then?

How could he grow to being capable of drawing against a terrifying person of the younger generation like Linghu Hongfei in such a short period of time?

Compared to the others, the impact of this news was greater for the Li Heavenly Clan.

At that moment, they were simply unable to stabilize their shaken hearts.

After all, they had nearly waged war against the clan that possessed such a genius!!!

Li Ruochu looked to Li Taiyi. “That’s why, Elder Taiyi, you really shouldn’t have spoken to Chu Feng in such a manner earlier. After all, he’s someone that everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield wants to entice. Even Lord Wuming Xingyun shows great favor toward him. Even Tantai Xiangnan is very respectful toward him.”

What? Even Tantai Xiangnan was respectful toward Chu Feng?

The Li Heavenly Clansmen felt even more astonished. They reacted as if they were mind-blown, and stood there somewhat absent-mindedly.

Wuming Xingyun was one thing. However, who was Tantai Xiangnan? He was the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and an Utmost Exalted-level expert.

At this moment, the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and several Supreme Elders all involuntarily looked to Li Anzhi. They all had an expression of blame in their eyes.

It was only at that moment that they realized that Chu Feng was actually already someone that their Li Heavenly Clan could not afford to offend.

“Ruochu, why... why didn’t you mention these things sooner?” Li Taiyi looked to Li Ruochu with complaint-filled eyes. Not to mention the others, even he himself regretted his actions.

He was afraid. Had he known that Chu Feng had matured to such a state, no matter how much hatred he held for him, he would still not dare to speak to him in such a manner.

“Even if I mentioned these things then, would you have believed me?” Li Ruochu shrugged helplessly.

“Why wouldn’t I believe you? Since when do I not trust you? Girl, you nearly killed this old man,” Li Taiyi cast a side eye at Li Ruochu.

At that moment, he no longer felt that kneeling to Chu Feng was a shameful act. Instead, he felt that he had saved himself by kneeling.

Li Taiyi’s reaction was not only seen by those from the older generation, but it was also captured by those of the younger generation. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Seeing the change in attitude toward Chu Feng in their clan’s respected elders, the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations began to feel even more complicated.

Chu Feng was able to change their Supreme Elder’s hostility to fear in such a short period of time all through his own ability. Someone like him was worthy of their reverence. However... when that person was someone of the same generation as them, someone even younger than them, the feeling that they had in their heart was no longer only that of simple reverence.

“Tianyou, are you still unconvinced by your defeat now?” With a smile on his face, Li Anzhi looked to Li Tianyou, who stood beside him.

Li Tianyou revealed a wry smile. He did not answer. Instead, he looked beside him to Li Yan, who had also been defeated by Chu Feng.

“Even if we’re unwilling to accept it, we have no choice but to do so. After all, that guy is simply too abnormal,” Li Yan was also smiling wryly. Then, he looked to Li Anzhi. “After all, Anzhi, even you have begun to recognize him.”

“Not just anyone can obtain my acknowledgement.”

“Actually, when I was defeated by him, I also felt humiliated. I thought that as long as I put forth greater effort, I would one day be able to get revenge for my defeat.”

“However, when I encountered him again in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, I realized that I would likely not be able to catch up to him for the rest of my life. I will not be able to get my revenge.”

“However, looking back at it now, I realize that the battle against him that day, the defeat that day, was not one of humiliation. Instead, it is more of an honor.”

“After all, I had fought completely unrestrained with such a powerful fellow. Furthermore, I was nearly able to win against him,” Li Anzhi smiled in a very contented manner.

Seeing Li Anzhi like that, the complicated expressions that Li Tianyou and the other younger generations had were also changed to smiles of relief.

If Li Anzhi’s battle against Chu Feng back then was truly an honor, then it would mean that they too... had obtained this honor.

At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations that had once held enormous hatred for Chu Feng were no longer looking at him with the contempt and hostility of the past.

Instead, they were looking at him with reverence, admiration and even slight adoration in their eyes.
