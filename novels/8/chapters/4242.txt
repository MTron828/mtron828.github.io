Chapter 4242 - What Makes You Think You’re Qualified?

Inside the Ancient Compliance Castle. Chu Feng continued to stand atop the Talent Steps’ third step. No matter how the flames raged, the look of pain on his face did not increase. Instead, his expression was easing.

The already-minimal look of pain was actually disappearing from Chu Feng’s face.

Chu Feng was actually growing accustomed to the power of the Talent Steps.

This astonished the people of the younger generation present so much, that they didn’t know how to react.

To them, Chu Feng’s appearance was like a giant mountain reminding them of how small they were.

“Kid, you can step down. You’ve already conquered the Talent Steps,” Old Man Compliance said to Chu Feng. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He tossed a title plate to Chu Feng as he said those words.

Many people revealed looks of curiosity when they saw the title plate.

That title plate looked very simple. It was only a wooden title plate.

But, the title plate not only emitted an Ancient Era’s aura, but the words ‘Ancient Compliance Castle’ were also engraved onto it.

It was the first time that anyone had seen a title plate like that. Thus, they were all very curious as to what use it had.

“This is your reward for successfully challenging the Talent Steps’ third step.”

“From today on, you can enter the Ancient Compliance Castle whenever you like.”

Old Man Compliance gave an answer to the confused crowd.

After hearing those words, the crowd realized the use of the title plate.

It was a passing plate. With that title plate, Chu Feng would likely be able to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle even if Old Man Compliance did not open it.

The Ancient Compliance Castle was a treasure trove. The treasures brought forth by the Compliance Mirror would at times surpass one’s imagination.

Being able to receive such treatment, Chu Feng was truly one to be envied.

The people of the younger generation knew very well that Chu Feng was qualified to receive such treatment.

After all, he had accomplished what had been impossible for everyone else. As such, it was only natural for him to enjoy a treatment that others could not.

At that moment, many people stepped forward to greet Chu Feng. They wanted to befriend him.

Chu Feng did not put on airs, and responded to them one by one.

Of course, he did not answer those people when they asked where Chu Feng came from, or who his master was.

Truth was, the only reason why Chu Feng was willing to bother with those people was because he was waiting for Yu Ting and Yuan Shu.

Whilst Chu Feng had challenged the Compliance Mirror and had received his reward, Yu Ting and Yuan Shu still hadn’t.

Finally, Yu Ting and Yuan Shu also walked over to the Compliance Mirror in succession.

Furthermore, the two of them managed to challenge the Compliance Mirror successfully, and received its treasures.

After the three of them received their treasures, they decided to leave the Ancient Compliance Castle.

Chu Feng had planned to bid his farewell to Old Man Compliance. But, he discovered that Old Man Compliance had already disappeared.

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng, Yu Ting and Yuan Shu decided to leave the Ancient Compliance Castle directly.

Once Chu Feng exited the Ancient Compliance Castle, he was immediately surrounded by the crowd outside.

Among them were people that pointed at the three of them and began to shout loudly.

“They’re out! They’ve come out!”

“The young woman beside Yuan Shu is Yu Ting. She successfully challenged the Talent Steps’ first step.”

“The young man beside Yuan Shu is that Chu Feng.”

“He not only successfully exited the Hidden Gate, but he also easily challenged the Talent Steps’ second and third steps.”

“Grandmaster Shao Dong’s grandson, Shao Yu, was seriously injured right after stepping onto the Talent Steps’ second step, and nearly died.”

“Yet, Chu Feng was completely unphased as he stood on the Talent Steps’ second step.”

“Even the Talent Steps’ third step did not affect him at all.”

“A demon-level genius. Never have I seen a demon-level genius like him. But... he’s standing right before us.”

It turned out that there were people of the younger generation that had exited the Ancient Compliance Castle before Chu Feng, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting.

Thus, the moment the three of them exited the Ancient Compliance Castle, they were immediately identified by the crowd.

“He was really unaffected when standing atop the Talent Steps?”

“His talent has actually reached such a level?”

Not to mention the people of the younger generation or those under a hundred years of age, even the people of the older generation, the renowned world spiritists of the Holy Light Galaxy, began to carefully examine Chu Feng and Yu Ting.

They were all very curious as to exactly what powers those two unknown geniuses belonged to, or which grand world spiritist’s brilliant students they might be.

There were even people that suspected that Chu Feng and Yu Ting might be fellow disciples from the same sect or master.

Suddenly, a voice sounded from the crowd, “You really challenged the Talent Steps’ second and third steps?”

When the crowd looked in the direction of the voice, their expressions all changed.

The person who had spoken had an elegant demeanor. Even though he was standing amongst all those powerful world spiritists, he was still very eye-catching.

He was a true dragon amongst men.

He... was the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s disciple Lu Jie.

“Does this brother need something from me?” Chu Feng asked with a stern voice.

He saw hostility in Lu Jie’s gaze. As such, he did not respond with a kind tone.

“I am Lu Jie. I’ve heard that brother Chu Feng possesses exceptional talent. Merely, I wonder if the rumors are real or not. As such, I wish to spar with brother Chu Feng with world spirit techniques.”

Once Lu Jie said those words, the expressions of the crowd grew even more marvelous.

Lu Jie had always been a proud and arrogant person. He had never taken the initiative to issue a challenge to anyone of the younger generation.

However, he had made an exception.

Everyone knew that Chu Feng had left an enormous shock on Lu Jie in his successful challenge of the Talent Steps’ second and third steps.

Being deemed as the most outstanding world spiritist of the younger generation in the Holy Light Galaxy, it was only natural that Lu Jie wouldn’t allow another to take his spot.

This was a battle of dignity, a battle of honor.

But, after Lu Jie spoke, Chu Feng looked to Lu Jie with narrowed eyes. He did not give Lu Jie an answer.

“Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you afraid?”

“Could it be that your talent is fake?” Lu Jie pressed after seeing that Chu Feng wasn’t responding. His voice had grown even more unpleasant.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng chuckled. As he was planning to say something, someone stepped before him and spoke first.

It was Yuan Shu.

“Brother Lu Jie, brother Chu Feng is still only a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age. You’ve trained in world spirit techniques much longer than him. It’s not very appropriate for you to issue a challenge to him, no?”

Yuan Shu knew very well how powerful Lu Jie was. Even though Chu Feng possessed exceptional talent, he would still be at an enormous disadvantage should he fight Lu Jie presently.

Because of that, Yuan Shu did not wish for the showdown to happen. Mainly, he feared that Chu Feng would be at a major disadvantage.

After Yuan Shu spoke, Lu Jie’s complexion turned gloomy. With a cold voice, he said, “Who the hell do you think you are? I’m speaking to Chu Feng here. What makes you think you’re qualified to interrupt?”

“......”

Hearing those words, Yuan Shu’s expression also turned ugly.

Back then, he had been equally as famous as Lu Jie. Never would he have imagined that there would be such a great disparity between the two of them now.

Perhaps Yuan Shu was still Grandmaster Tang Chen’s brilliant student, an outstanding young world spiritist and even a rare genius in the eyes of others.

But, in Lu Jie’s eyes, Yuan Shu has been reduced to a third-rate existence.

“Never would I have imagined that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s disciple would be so lacking in manners that he would refuse to even allow others to speak.”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng stood before Yuan Shu. He stared at Lu Jie and said, “Since that’s the case, I would like to ask you something.”

“What do you want to ask? Speak away,” said Lu Jie.

Chu Feng smiled mockingly before saying, “You never even challenged the Talent Steps’ second step. You failed to even stabilize your name on the first step. Who gave you the courage to challenge me?”

“Did you actually think that you were qualified to challenge me?”
