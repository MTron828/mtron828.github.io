MGA: Chapter 1635 - Water Immortal Profound Technique

At the time when the splendid sun illuminated the earth, a Martial Emperor-level expert had also arrived at Chu Feng’s residence. It was a man, a person Chu Feng had seen before.

Last night, when Chu Feng first caused that abnormal sign, that man had come to his residence. Even though he did not enter, and left after a single glance at Chu Feng’s residence, he had still left a very deep impression on Chu Feng. The reason for that was because when he glanced at Chu Feng’s residence, his gaze was filled with killing intent.

At this moment, that man was talking with Aunt Lian. From the dialogue between the two, Chu Feng came to know that man’s name was Nangong Huayi.

As for the content of their conversation, he wanted Chu Feng to go and participate in the Secret Skill Inheritance Assembly.

“Chu Feng, let’s go,” Aunt Lian entered to find Chu Feng.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded. He also wished to see exactly what sort of secret skill that so-called Water Immortal Profound Technique was. He wanted to know whether it, or the Four Great Secret Skills that he possessed, were stronger.

Being guided by Aunt Lian, Chu Feng arrived at a very vast underground palace. It was not only Chu Feng and Aunt Lian who had arrived; Nangong Baihe, Nangong Moli and Nangong Ya had also come.

When they reached the depths of the underground palace, Chu Feng discovered that there were a lot of people gathered there, over a thousand people at the very minimum. The older ones were close to a hundred years old, whereas the younger ones were not even ten years old.

However, regardless what the cultivations of those people were currently, they all possessed very decent talent. Otherwise, they would not have been brought to this place and given this chance to obtain a secret skill.

Most importantly, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s three Princes and one Princess were also present. It was not only them, that disciple of the White-browed Immortal called Meng Xiaoyan was also present.

“That guy, why is he here?”

After Chu Feng appeared, the Eldest Prince Nangong Tianlong and the others all started to frown. Evidently, they had not expected that Chu Feng would appear in this place.

At this moment, Nangong Tianlong and the others had very hostile gazes as they looked to Chu Feng. This was especially true for Nangong Tianshi. He simply had the appearance of wanting to hack Chu Feng into eight pieces.

After all, he had been properly displaying his soaring golden dragon last night. He had thought that he would be able to obtain his father’s good graces.

However, unexpectedly, Chu Feng also revealed his abnormal sign. Not only had he revealed his abnormal sign, his abnormal sign had even scared away the golden dragon. This caused Nangong Tianshi to be utterly humiliated. Thus, he bitterly hated Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, why are you here? Get the hell out of here!” In anger, Nangong Tianshi cursed loudly.

“Impudent! Is Chu Feng someone who you can drive out?!” Aunt Lian stared fiercely at Nangong Tianshi.

“Aunt Lian, he is an outsider. What makes him qualified to participate in our Nangong Imperial Clan’s Secret Skill Inheritance Assembly?” Nangong Tianshi asked.

“Outsider? It seems to me that Chu Feng is not the only outsider here, no?” Nangong Ya asked. As he spoke, he took a glance at Meng Xiaoyan, who was standing beside Nangong Tianlong.

“My master has already joined the Nangong Imperial Clan. Precisely speaking, I am not an outsider,” Meng Xiaoyan said with a beaming smile.

“Chu Feng has come here under the personal permission from Lord Clan Chief. If you all possess any objections, you can go and question the Lord Clan Chief yourselves.”

Aunt Lian had lost her patience. As she spoke, she waved her sleeve and caused a strong breeze to sweep forth. The strong breeze pushed all of the bystanders away. Even Nangong Tianlong and the others, although they were princes and princess, were no exception.

Afterward, Aunt Lian brought Chu Feng with her and walked further in. They walked all the way into the deepest region of the underground palace.

“Damn it! She dared to attack us! I am going to find Imperial Father to complain!” Seeing this scene, Nangong Tianshi was so enraged that he started to gnash his teeth in anger. He turned around and planned to go find his Imperial Father.

“Third brother, let it pass. Since Nangong Lian said it like this, I believe it should be true,” Nangong Tianlong said.

“What? True? Why would Imperial Father have that guy participate in our competition?” Nangong Tianshi was extremely confused.

“Imperial Father most definitely possesses his own reasonings,” Nangong Tianlong said.

“Forget about it, since he is already here, we’ll let him stay. He’s merely a rank one Half Martial Emperor. In this place, he cannot be considered to be anything. How could the secret skill possibly choose him?” Nangong Tianhu said. Even though he disliked Chu Feng enormously, he did not consider Chu Feng to be a rival. Instead, he looked down on Chu Feng from the bottom of his heart.

Chu Feng completely ignored the comments from the others. After he reached the deepest area, he began to carefully inspect his surroundings.

There was a world spirit formation in the deepest region. This world spirit formation was very powerful. It was the doing of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.

However, that world spirit technique was not there to guard against foreign attacks. Rather, it was there to guard against internal attacks. In other words, it was not a defensive barrier, but rather a cage used to hold something in captivity.

Using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to see through the world spirit formation. He discovered that there was a blue stele located in the center of that world spirit formation. That stele contained a special power. Likely, sealed within that stele was the secret skill, the Water Immortal Profound Technique.

“Little friends, I’ve made you all wait,” Right at this moment, White-browed Immortal appeared.

“That person’s a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Could he be the White-browed Immortal? The White-browed Immortal has really joined our Nangong Imperial Clan?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Many people were excited to see the White-browed Immortal. In the past couple days, they had all heard rumors of the White-browed Immortal joining their Nangong Imperial Clan as a nominal elder. Upon seeing him today, it would appear that those rumors were true.

Their Nangong Imperial Clan was a clan with overflowing battle power. However, their world spirit techniques could not be considered top quality at all. Yet, if the White-browed Immortal were to provide them with guidance, their world spirit techniques would likely be able to advance by leaps and bounds.

Most importantly, there were only ten Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the entire Holy Land of Martialism. And now, their Nangong Imperial Clan possessed a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Just thinking about it caused the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan to feel pride.

“Little friends, this old man and his disciple have indeed joined the Nangong Imperial Clan. As of yesterday, I have become a nominal elder of the Nangong Imperial Clan,” White-browed Immortal spoke with a smile.

He was rather courteous toward these members of the younger generation. After all, he knew that the people here were all of the most excellent members of the younger generation from the Nangong Imperial Clan. Many years later, they would be the ones to support the Nangong Imperial Clan.

“Haha, Immortal has really joined our Nangong Imperial Clan. This is truly great!” Seeing that the White-browed Immortal had really joined their Nangong Imperial Clan, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s younger generation were endlessly excited.

“Little friends, you are all the Nangong Imperial Clan’s outstanding talents. In the future, the Nangong Imperial Clan must be propped up by you all.”

“Today, we have gathered you all here for a good deed.”

“I believe, little friends, that you all have heard about secret skills before, that there are a total of five of the most powerful secret skills in the Holy Land of Martialism.”

“The five of them are, respectively, the Gold Immortal Profound Technique, the Wood Immortal Profound Technique, the Water Immortal Profound Technique, the Fire Immortal Profound Technique and the Earth Immortal Profound Technique.”

[1. Named after the five elements; gold/metal, wood, water, fire and earth]

“These five secret skills have existed since the Ancient Era. They were created by an enormously powerful expert who traveled about the Ancient Era unhindered. All of them possess extremely dreadful might.”

“Furthermore, legend has it that as long as one is able to obtain all five secret skills, one will be able to obtain a secret to open a treasure deposit.”

“Unfortunately, it has been several tens of thousands of years since the Ancient Era. Even though the five secret skills have been in circulation the entire time, there has never been anyone capable of obtaining all five of them.”

“Even now, the Gold Immortal Profound Technique is in the hands of the Mortal King Palace, the Wood Immortal Profound Technique is in the hands of the Heavenly Law Palace, and the Earth Immortal Profound Technique is in the hands of the Underworld Palace.”

[2. Don’t know if I mentioned this before, the three palaces are respectively named after man, heaven and earth. ‘Underworld’ in chinese is literally ‘earth prison’.]

“As for the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique, they had been lost for many years, and were on the verge of extinction.”

“However, I have a piece of good news today. The long-lost Water Immortal Profound Technique has come to our Nangong Imperial Clan.”

“Not only was our Nangong Imperial Clan able to obtain the Water Immortal Profound Technique, Lord Clan Chief is also going to impart the Water Immortal Profound Technique to the Nangong Imperial Clan’s younger generation.”

“Little friends, all of you possess the chance to obtain the legendary strongest secret skill, the Water Immortal Profound Technique,” White-browed Immortal said.

“Woooahhh~~~~”

Hearing those words, the crowd became extremely excited, and actually began to cheer in unison. After all, they had all heard about the legend of the Water Immortal Profound Technique. To actually possess the opportunity to obtain the legendary secret skill, they would naturally be filled with incomparable excitement.
