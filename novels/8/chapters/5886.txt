Chapter 5887: You Cleared My Trial

After blocking Chu Feng’s attack, Sansheng Xingyu’s eyebrows shot up. He didn’t say a word, but he glared at Chu Feng with eyes filled with animosity. He was displeased about Chu Feng attacking him without any warning, but even so, he didn’t further raise his fighting prowess.

Instead, he pointed his hand toward Chu Feng and opened his palm. A burst of martial power rushed at Chu Feng like an invisible net, seeking to trap him.

Chu Feng quickly formed a hand seal and pointed his right hand at the sky.

Boom!

A formation sword pierced through space and shattered the martial power net.

Just as Sansheng Xingyu wasn’t using his full power, Chu Feng wasn’t exerting his true strength either.

Spirit power was not as strong as martial power; the true strength of a world spiritist lay in their formations. A powerful formation could amplify spirit power by more than a thousand times. If a world spiritist’s formation was formidable, they could suppress cultivators of equivalent strength.

In gist, martial power had more potential than spirit power, but world spiritist techniques had more potential than martial skills.

Of course, this was dependent on the world spiritist’s ability to construct and control formations. Most world spiritists were lacking in their ability to do this, resulting in them being weaker than cultivators of the same rank.

Chu Feng didn’t have any exceptionally powerful formation on hand, but his spirit power was strong because of his bloodline and superior world spiritist techniques. Thanks to that, he was able to easily pierce Sansheng Xingyu’s martial power.

Faced with Chu Feng’s formation sword, Sansheng Xingyu knew that he couldn’t deal with it with just his martial power. So, he flicked his arm and released a powerful burst of martial power shaped like a palm.

Sansheng Xingyu had used a martial skill, and it was a rank nine Taboo Exalted. He knew that he couldn’t deal with this attack with ordinary martial skills.

Yet, Chu Feng’s formation sword still pierced through his martial power palm.

Not even a rank nine Exalted Taboo could stop Chu Feng’s formation sword.

Clang!

Sansheng Xingyu flicked his wrist and took out a silver spear. It was an Exalted Armament. Someone of his standing should have a God Armament in possession, but he chose to use an Exalted Armament instead.

It was hard to tell whether he was arrogant or trying to probe him, but Sansheng Xingyu still wasn’t using his full strength yet.

Nevertheless, the Exalted Armament raised his fighting prowess. He pointed his finger at the sky, and a surge of martial power light whizzed forth.

With that, Chu Feng’s formation sword finally crumbled.

The martial power light didn’t just stop there and instead continued rushing toward Chu Feng. However, the latter stood still on the spot, as if he had lost his nerves. Even when the martial power light was on the verge of reaching him, he did not attempt to dodge.

Eventually, the martial power light engulfed Chu Feng whole.

Sansheng Xingyu widened his eyes in astonishment. He hadn’t expected to obliterate Chu Feng with that move.

Chu Feng’s aura vanished into thin air after being engulfed by the martial power light.

“No, this isn’t right.” Sansheng Xingyu narrowed his eyes.

Sensing that something was amiss, anxiety showed on his face. There was only spirit power and no blood where the martial power light had engulfed.

All of a sudden, Chu Feng’s aura appeared behind him.

What the martial power light engulfed was just a clone. The real Chu Feng had unknowingly snuck up behind him. By the time Sansheng Xingyu realized that Chu Feng’s palm was already rushing at him.

Chu Feng’s palm was directed at Sansheng Xingyu’s back, but the latter tried to turn around to look at him, which resulted in the palm strike landing on the other party’s chest.

This shouldn’t have been anything much, as Chu Feng had hidden a formation in his palm to restrict Sansheng Xingyu’s martial power and freedom. He wouldn’t be able to move or channel his martial power to raise his cultivation any further.

He was planning to claim victory with this one move.

Yet, when the palm harnessing the formation struck Sansheng Xingyu, Chu Feng’s cold eyes widened in astonishment.

Chu Feng wasn’t planning to kill Sansheng Xingyu, but that didn’t mean that he wouldn’t make the latter suffer. After all, Sansheng Xingyu arrogantly declared that he would take Zi Ling as his concubine.

He was already showing plenty of respect to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan by sparing Sansheng Xingyu’s life.

Yet, the first thing he felt with his palm was a soft sensation, which made him instantaneously realize that something was amiss. A man’s pectoral muscles couldn’t have been this soft.

Thus, he hurriedly tried to retract his strength, but it was already too late.

Sansheng Xingyu was sent flying a distance away. Due to the powerful force behind the palm strike, he even retched and spurted a mouthful of blood.

“You... are a woman?” Chu Feng asked.

“You can’t tell?”

Sansheng Xingyu glared at Chu Feng grudgingly, though it was hard to tell whether her grudge was due to his inability to discern her gender or him hitting somewhere inappropriate earlier.

Now that Chu Feng was taking a closer look, Sansheng Xingyu, despite her slightly masculine facial features, did have a fair complexion and resembled a woman more.

“How am I supposed to know whether you’re a man or a woman when you’re dressed like that? Besides, didn’t you arrogantly declare that you’d take Zi Ling as your concubine? I didn’t think a woman would do that,” Chu Feng said.

Sansheng Xingyu was baffled. “Take Zi Ling as my concubine? Where did you hear that from?”

Chu Feng realized from her reaction that there was a misunderstanding. “Sansheng Qiutian said so.”

“He’s spouting rubbish!” Sansheng Xingyu roared.

“I was duped by him?”

“What else do you think?”

“Why didn’t you stop me then?”

“I said that you need to overcome my trial, but I didn’t say that you have to cross blows with me. All you have to do is to decipher an object. You were the one who attacked me out of the blue,” Sansheng Xingyu said.

“Ah... What is the object then?” Chu Feng asked.

“Let me go first,” Sansheng Xingyu said. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Chu Feng formed a hand seal, and the spirit power chain binding Sansheng Xingyu dissipated as spirit power.

“When did you do it?” Sansheng Xingyu asked.

“What do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“When did you construct the clone formation and sneak behind me?”

“I did it while my formation sword was clashing with your rank nine Taboo Exalted.”

“Let’s go,” Sansheng Xingyu said as she led him deeper into the city.

“You didn’t bring the item I have to decipher?” Chu Feng asked as he followed her.

“You have proven yourself qualified by constructing an ingenious formation within such a short time. There’s no need to go through the additional hassle of deciphering my object. You have cleared my trial.”
