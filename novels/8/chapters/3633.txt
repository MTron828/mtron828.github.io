Chapter 3633 - Chess Power Formation

Apart from the people that ascended into the second and third worlds, the people that remained seemed to have made plans beforehand.

They all sat down cross-legged in an orderly manner to train and absorb the surrounding chess power.

After absorbing the chess power for some time, they stood up nearly simultaneously.

Standing there, they seemed like warriors that had prepared for a long time. Each and every one of them was bursting with life, and appeared very aggressive.

That said, there was an exception -- Chu Feng.

Compared to the others that were already prepared for battle, Chu Feng was still sitting cross-legged with his eyes shut.

“Chu Feng, you should be done, no?”

“If we are to continue waiting, our opponents would’ve occupied all eight treasured grounds,” someone said to Chu Feng.

“Forget him. He has just entered this place. Likely, he doesn’t even know how to properly absorb the chess power.”

“What are we to do then? Are we to waste a spot just like this?”

“Forget it. He wouldn’t make any difference anyway.”

“Fine. It’s all because he’s Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” someone sighed. “Even Miss Xian Yun had to give him face.”

The crowd were discussing him spiritedly. Although their voices were not loud, they were filled with discontent toward Chu Feng.

Suddenly, someone pointed to the distant mountain range and shouted, “Look! Those guys from the All-heaven Starfield have already occupied the treasured grounds!”

Sure enough, upon looking over, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations had appeared around the mountain peak’s eight treasured grounds.

That said, they did not immediately occupy those treasured grounds. Instead, their gazes were fixed onto the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations.

Some among them were even gesturing with their hands for the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations to quickly come up to them.

“They’re actually just standing there. They are simply provoking us. We must properly teach them a lesson,” a man from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City spoke with great displeasure.

He was not the only one. Many other people of the younger generation present were also feeling very displeased.

Right at that moment, a man from Monstrous Holy City said, “Don’t be in such a rush.”

After he spoke, the crowd that were feeling very restless and wanted to rush up the mountain peak to have a showdown against the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations all calmed down.

The reason for that was because that man from Monstrous Holy City was holding a banner in his hand. The banner signified that he was not an ordinary person. At the very least, he was someone with status within the chess formation.

He was a head flag-bearer. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the chess formation, each party had a commander, three head flag-bearers, and nine small flag-bearers.

Those people were tasked with commanding everyone in setting up formations.

Xian Yun was the commander. She would boss around the three head flag-bearers. As for the head flag-bearers, they would in turn give orders to the small flag-bearers.

They were capable of transmitting the situation of the battle to other flag-bearers in the form of messages using their flags. Although they were unable to send voice transmissions, it was sufficient to set up formations.

Most importantly, if a commander was powerful enough, they would be able to use the flags and their own chess power to assist the head flag-bearers.

Because of that, the commander, head flag-bearers and small flag-bearers were extremely important in Ancient Era’s Cultivator Chess.

“Charge!”

Suddenly, that head flag-bearer shouted loudly. Following that, he soared into the sky. The others followed closely behind him. They were all rushing to the mountain range.

“Hey, what’s going on with you all? Why is someone sleeping over there?”

A loud voice sounded from the mountain range. It was from the people of the All-heaven Starfield.

The person that they spoke of was none other than Chu Feng, who was still absorbing chess power.

“Humph, even if we give you all a one-man handicap, we’ll still be able to win,” the head flag-bearer from Monstrous Holy City said.

“Yoh? You guys actually left sixty people in this first level world? You’re planning to bully us with numbers?”

“It’s not that they’re trying to outnumber us, it’s simply that there are too many mediocre people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield. They’re unable to enter the second world, and thus had no choice but to stay in the first world. They can’t help it.”

“Hahaha...”

Cutting and mocking remarks sounded from the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations nonstop.

Their cutting remarks were actually not without basis. Adding on Chu Feng, the Ancestral Martial Starfield had left a total of sixty people in the first world.

As for the All-heaven Starfield, they only had forty-three people.

Judging from the number of people in the first world, it was indeed the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s side that possessed an advantage.

However, since each side only had a hundred and eight participants, gaining an advantage in number in the first world meant that they would be disadvantaged in the second and third level.

“Humph. You’ll soon realize how powerful we are.”

In the blink of an eye, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations descended on the mountain peak.

They were prepared to battle for the treasured grounds.

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations had obtained better positioning from their earlier maneuver. They were planning to defend as their offense.

However, they had underestimated the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations. Even though they had superior numbers, they did not choose to attack head-on.

Instead, they began to set up a formation to begin a battle of attrition from afar.

They stood in midair. The formation that they set up turned their boundless chess power into arrows that filled the sky. Those arrows shot down upon the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations defending the treasured grounds repeatedly.

“Damn it! Those bastards actually set up such a formation?!”

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations had always fought the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations head-on.

They had never encountered a situation like this. Originally, they had thought that they had gained a better position, and were waiting for the arrival of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations with confidence.

However, they were now being shot by a rain of arrows. Like targets, they were being bombarded by the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generation’s arrow formation.

The rain of arrows were extremely powerful. In the beginning, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were capable of resisting it. However, gradually, their stamina was being worn out and some people were being injured. Some were even seriously injured, and eliminated from the match.

With no other choice, they decided to escape from the treasured grounds.

After they fled, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations immediately occupied the treasured grounds and set up another formation.

They set up a defensive formation that not only covered the eight treasured grounds, but also covered the people that set up the formations, protecting them.

Seeing that the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations had decided to defend their position, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations decided to unleash a counterattack.

However, they discovered that the protective formation composed of chess power was actually impregnable.

“Damn it! We were too careless! Never would I have expected them to have prepared that.”

“That bunch of trash clearly possess limited chess power. How could they cooperate so perfectly to set up such a powerful chess power formation?”

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were all at a complete loss as to what to do.

“What’s this? Helpless?”

“Your commander should be Nangong Yifan, right? Even he is helpless against this?”

“Turns out, Nangong Yifan isn’t much either.”

At that moment, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations began to mock the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations.

They had always suffered losses in every match of Ancient Era’s Cultivator Chess.

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were not honest and good individuals. Thus, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations had suffered an enormous amount of ridicule and mockery from them.

At that moment, they were finally able to properly humiliate the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations. Naturally, they would not let the opportunity slip by.

“Not bad, not bad. It would appear that you all have put forth quite a lot of effort for today’s battle,” said the All-heaven Starfield’s head flag-bearer.

“You’re right. For today’s battle, we have put forth more effort than you can imagine. Thus, we are destined to win today’s battle,” the Monstrous Holy City’s head flag-bearer said loudly.

“Oh? That’s not for certain,” after that head flag-bearer finished saying those words, he snapped the flag he held in his hand.

“You...” Seeing that, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were all confused.

That flag was not only capable of communicating with the small flag-bearers, but it was also able to communicate with the commander. That flag would even be able to gain assistance from the commander.

If one were to destroy that flag, it would mean that they would lose an extremely essential aspect to victory.

Thus, to win, the two parties would generally think of ways to attack the head flag-bearers to destroy their flags.

Those younger generations from the All-heaven Starfield had evidently been caught in a state of absolute passivity. Logically, it was time for them to use the flag to seek assistance from their commander.

Yet, their head flag-bearer had decided to personally destroy the flag. This was simply something that the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield could not comprehend.

Most importantly, after destroying the flag, that All-heaven Starfield’s head flag-bearer’s face was brimming with smiles.

That smile of his was very strange. Seeing that smile, one would feel very uneasy.
