Chapter 3358 - The Truth Revealed

‘This guy, what is he planning to do?’

Chu Hanqing and his accomplices were in utter panic. Upon seeing the imposter, they immediately started to send voice transmissions to him, telling him to quickly get out of this place and not create trouble for them.

Unfortunately, the imposter reacted as if he did not hear them at all, and did not even bother glancing at them. He continued to step on air as he walked toward the plaza, arriving at the center of the plaza.

At that moment, Chu Hanqing’s legs were shivering.

Whilst their Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief could not see through that imposter, how could Wuming Gangxiong not be able to see through him? Even if he were unable to see through the imposter, Wuming Fenghuo must be able to see through him.

Chu Hanqing knew that, regardless of how good of a disguise that imposter had, he was still only an imposter.

“Who are you?” With a serious expression, Wuming Fenghuo began to size up the imposter.

Perhaps not even Chu Hanqing would’ve imagined that someone of Wuming Fenghuo’s caliber would fail to see through the disguise of the imposter.

“Who I am is not important. What’s important is... that I can prove that Chu Feng is being wrongly accused,” The imposter said.

“How are you to prove that?” Wuming Fenghuo asked.

“I can because the person who disguised himself as Chu Feng and poisoned the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief that day was me,” The imposter Chu Feng said.

“Putt~~~”

Once the imposter Chu Feng said those words, many people fell paralyzed to the ground.

Their complexions turned deathly pale, and their bodies were soaked with cold sweat. Everyone could tell that those people were scared unconscious.

Indeed, they were frightened into fits. Those were all Chu Hanqing’s co-conspirators, people that had plotted to frame Chu Feng. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

They had originally thought their plot to be invulnerable. Never did they imagine that the most important person in their plot, the person who had repeated over and over again that he wanted Chu Feng to suffer a miserable death, would actually stand up and confess to everything.

Unable to withstand what had just happened, they ended up fainting from fear.

Seeing the people that were frightened unconscious, everyone could tell that they were related to the framing of Chu Feng.

However, apart from the people from the Law Enforcement Hall that were secretly approaching them to prevent them from escaping, no one else bothered to pay attention to them.

“Why did you disguise yourself as Chu Feng to poison the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief? Could it be that there’s some sort of hatred between you and him?” Wuming Fenghuo asked.

“I do not have any hatred for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. I was merely asked to poison him,” The imposter Chu Feng said.

Once he said those words, ignoring the minor schemers that were scared witless or even fainted, even Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou felt their legs grow soft. They nearly even lost their footing.

“It’s them.”

Sure enough, the imposter Chu Feng pointed to Chu Hanqing, Chu Hanyouyou and the other co-conspirators.

All of the people that had planned to frame Chu Feng were pointed out by the imposter Chu Feng one after another.

“This!!!”

At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan had burst into a complete uproar.

Including even Chu Hanpeng and Chu Xuanzhengfa, none of them had imagined that there were so many people that wanted to frame Chu Feng.

“You... you’re making false accusations!” Chu Hanqing shouted furiously.

The imposter Chu Feng laughed mockingly at Chu Hanqing’s counter-accusation. Then, he pointed to the people of the younger generation that had gone to pay Chu Feng a visit that day, and looked to Wuming Fenghuo, “Those people of the younger generation indeed all went to pay Chu Feng a visit that day. They can bear witness to the fact that Chu Feng was not present that day.”

“Merely, they were lying. Chu Hanqing has given them poison, and forced them to lie. Furthermore, he fed them medicinal pellets that could stabilize their emotions, allowing them to lie through their teeth.”

“Milord, you will know if what I’ve said is true or not once you examine them.”

Once the imposter Chu Feng said those words, everyone turned their eyes to the people of the younger generation. Suspicion filled their gazes.

The reason for that was because what the imposter Chu Feng had said sounded so very real. Besides, if the imposter Chu Feng was lying, Wuming Fenghuo would immediately find that out once he examined those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.

There could only be a single explanation as to why the imposter Chu Feng was so confident. That is, what he said was the truth.

“Milord, we know our wrongs. Milord, please spare us, please spare us.”

“We were all forced to do this. It’s because of Supreme Elders Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou, they forced us to do this.”

Faced with the suspecting gazes, those people of the younger generation were finally unable to contain themselves anymore. One by one, they knelt on the ground and began to weep with bitter tears as they begged Wuming Fenghuo for forgiveness.

At that moment, the crowd were all astonished.

As matters stood, there was sufficient proof to verify the claims of that imposter Chu Feng.

So many clansmen of the Chu Heavenly Clan, including even two Supreme Elders, had actually acted together to plot against Chu Feng. For the sake of killing Chu Feng, they went as far as to poison their Lord Clan Chief.

Oh how ruthless that was!!!

They were simply the absolute worst scum!!!

“Woosh, woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, two figures soared into the sky.

They were Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou.

Seeing that their scheme had been exposed and that there was no way for them to quibble about this matter, the only thing they could do was escape.

Otherwise... only death would await them.

However, right after they soared into the sky, they immediately fell back down like loose kites, ruthlessly crashing into the ground.

Wuming Fenghuo retrieved his hand. With a beaming smile, he looked to Chu Hanqing and his accomplices, “It would appear that the whole truth is revealed now. That said, the course of events is much more surprising than I’ve imagined.”

It was actually because of Wuming Fenghuo that Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou suddenly fell down from the sky.

With someone like Wuming Fenghuo present, Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou would naturally not be able to escape.
