Chapter 3750 - Divine Body Vs. Demon Body

“What? Divine Power?”

“Heavens! That’s Divine Power?!”

“Never have I witnessed such a powerful Divine Power!”

The crowd felt utter disbelief upon learning that Chu Feng’s power was Divine Power. It was all because his Divine Power was simply too imposing.

However, Grandmaster Liangqiu was someone with great prestige in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Thus, when he declared it to be Divine Power, the crowd had no choice but to believe it, even if they were unwilling to do so.

“Divine Power?”

Upon hearing Grandmaster Liangqiu’s words, the expressions of the mother and daughter Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi changed greatly. Subconsciously, they looked to each other.

At that moment, the two of them discovered that they had the same sort of expression in their eyes.

After Grandmaster Liangqiu declared it to be Divine Power, they came to a realization.

It would appear that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not lie. He seemed to truly possess the means to help others fuse with Divine Power.

Otherwise, how could Chu Feng possibly possess Divine Power? After all, he was a Heavenly Bloodline possessor.

“Who’s Divine Power is that? Is it Chu Feng’s Divine Power?”

“But, that shouldn’t be possible. He is clearly a Heavenly Bloodline possessor. How could he possess Divine Power? That is simply unheard of.”

The crowd felt utter disbelief. In fact, they felt it to be impossible.

There were people that began to survey their surroundings in hopes of seeing if there were any hidden experts that had released such a mighty Divine Power.

It wasn’t that the crowd did not believe that Chu Feng was capable of possessing such a powerful Divine Power, how could they not?

They knew very well how talented Chu Feng was.

Merely, it was simply impossible for a cultivator to possess both a Heavenly Bloodline and Divine Power.

This had nothing to do with one’s talent. It was simply impossible in and of itself.

Regardless of whether it might be Heavenly Bloodlines or Divine Power, if one were to possess either of them, it would mean that one was loved by the heavens, and was much more fortunate than ordinary people.

For a person to possess both Divine Power and a Heavenly Bloodline, how enormously fortunate must they be?

At the very least, up until that point, they had simply never heard of such a thing.

Keep in mind that they’d never heard of it, and never seen it.

“Huu~~~”

Suddenly, the golden light and enormous might that filled the sky turned into a ray of golden light and descended, entering Chu Feng’s body.

At the same time, the crowd were able to clearly sense his aura.

Chu Feng’s aura had increased again. From rank eight Exalted, he had become a rank nine Exalted!!!

“This...”

At that moment, the crowd were all dumbstruck. Even the elders that had witnessed a lot of things opened their mouths wide in shock.

In fact, even the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Linghu Zhishi, had a look of shock.

“How could this be... he... actually really possesses Divine Power?” Linghu Zhishi muttered in a low voice. His voice was also filled with astonishment.

As for the others, they were not only stunned; they were simply terrified.

At that moment, the previously clamorous surroundings had become absolutely quiet again...

“Boom~~~”

In the following instant, the crowd exploded in an uproar.

“Heavens! Chu Feng... he actually managed to possess both Divine Power and a Heavenly Bloodline at the same time.”

“A child beloved by the heavens, that is truly a child beloved by the heavens!!!”

Many people were crying out in alarm. They were no longer considering what the Linghu Heavenly Clan might think. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

They were truly incapable of containing their emotions.

Even though the matter was unrelated to them, they felt extremely honored to be able to witness such a scene.

“Drop dead!!!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.

It was Linghu Hongfei. An enormous white mirror had appeared before him.

It was the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens.

Not only did Linghu Hongfei unleash his Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens, but that Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens had also sent forth a beam of white light straight towards Chu Feng.

Although the beam white of light was headed towards him, Chu Feng did not attempt to dodge or avoid it. He allowed that terrifying white light to devour his body.

Most shocking of all, even though the power of that white beam of light was clearly so powerful, Chu Feng was completely unharmed after it passed by him!!!

“How could this be?”

The crowd looked towards each other. They were unable to comprehend what had just happened.

No matter how powerful Chu Feng might be, how could he not be injured after withstanding the white beam of light with his body?

After all, that white beam of light was the attack of an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, the strongest martial skill of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

“It should be my turn now, no?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng spoke. After saying those words, Chu Feng directly unleashed his attack and shot forth a punch.

“Boom~~~”

With his punch, martial power visible to the naked eye soared into the sky. Not only did it strike Linghu Hongfei, but it even pierced through his body, and left an enormous hole in his giant body.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

Linghu Hongfei let out a scream, and his body began to change. He returned to his original appearance and lost the ability to fly. Like a loose kite, he spun around and started falling downwards. Ultimately, he crashed ferociously into the ground.

After crashing, Linghu Hongfei continued to scream painfully. He was grabbing his chest with a look of suffering.

“He not only blocked an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, but he even defeated Linghu Hongfei with a single punch?”

“That’s simply too powerful. What exactly is going on?”

Seeing that Chu Feng had actually managed to defeat Linghu Hongfei with a single punch, the crowd simply did not dare to believe their eyes.

“That’s the disparity in strength.”

At the moment when the crowd were all confused, Gu Mingyuan, who had been quiet the entire time, suddenly spoke.

“Disparity in strength? But aren’t the two of them clearly both rank nine Exalted?” the crowd asked.

“Although the two of them both increased their cultivations to rank nine Exalted using their respective methods, it remains that strength differs enormously, even among those with the same cultivation.”

“Although Linghu Hongfei’s cultivation had also increased, his power was extremely unstable. Because of that, his battle power was extremely weak.”

“However, it is different for Chu Feng. His Divine Power is extremely strong to begin with. It far surpasses other people’s Divine Power.”

“With the circumstances like that, his battle power did not decrease, it instead increased greatly.”

“That is disparity,” said Gu Mingyuan.

Hearing those words, the crowd came to a sudden realization.

They were, after all, also cultivators themselves. Thus, it was actually not difficult for them to understand such a disparity.

It was just that they were uncertain earlier. They’d thought about such a disparity being the case, but they did not dare to be certain of their guesses.

However, now they’d ascertained it to be the case. After all, Gu Mingyuan was qualified to make such a judgement.

“Exalted Heavenly Fate, can the Life and Death Contract take effect now?”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s voice was heard.

After Chu Feng’s voice was heard, the crowd realized that he had already descended, and was standing before Linghu Hongfei.

Chu Feng was planning to dig out his eyes.

“This... I...”

Exalted Heavenly Fate was holding the Life and Death Contract in his hand. However, he had become speechless.

Exalted Heavenly Fate was standing there in a stupefied manner. He was enormously shocked by the failure of his prophecy.

“Linghu Hongfei, are you prepared?” At that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Linghu Hongfei.

Hearing those words, Linghu Hongfei’s heart tensed up. The others present also grew tense.

Could Chu Feng really be planning to dig out Linghu Hongfei’s eyes?

But, Linghu Hongfei was not the only person present. The Linghu Heavenly Clan and even Linghu Zhishi were all there.

Would Chu Feng really dare to dig out Linghu Hongfei’s eyes in such circumstances?

However, at the moment when the great majority of the crowd felt that he would not dare, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Linghu Hongfei.

Regardless of what the crowd might think, Chu Feng simply did not seem like he was planning to stop.

“Chu Feng, I’d urge you to stop immediately!”

Suddenly, a voice exploded in the sky.

It was Linghu Zhishi. Not only was his voice very deep and powerful, but it was also filled with displeasure.

Linghu Hongfei’s defeat had brought great displeasure to Linghu Zhishi.

Sensing the displeasure in Linghu Zhishi’s voice, the crowd immediately shut their mouths.

They actually did not even have the courage to speak.

After all, regardless of how heaven-defying Chu Feng’s talent might be, the strongest person in the Ancestral Martial Starfield was none other than Linghu Zhishi.

No one was willing to offend him.

However, even though everyone was afraid of him, Chu Feng was not.

“And what if I refuse to stop?” Chu Feng asked.

“In that case, everyone related to you shall be buried here today,” Linghu Zhishi said coldly.

“Are you threatening me?” asked Chu Feng.

“It is not a threat. Rather, it’s a warning,” Linghu Zhishi’s voice turned even colder. It seemed like he did not even have the patience to speak with Chu Feng.

“Oh,” Chu Feng nodded.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng moved his arm, and a splash of blood splattered forth.

That blood had come from Linghu Hongfei’s face.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

Following that, a miserable scream was heard.

Due to the fact that the region was particularly quiet, the scream sounded particularly miserable.

Looking over to Linghu Hongfei, the crowd discovered that he was covering his eyes with his hands. A great amount of blood was flowing from his face and his hands.

“Clan Chief Linghu, look carefully.”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng raised his right hand and opened his fist.

The crowd was able to see that Chu Feng’s palm was covered in blood.

In the center of that blood-covered palm were Linghu Hongfei’s eyes.

Seeing his eyes, the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s eyes turned crimson with anger, and his veins bulged explosively.

However, to everyone’s surprise, Chu Feng actually made another motion.

Chu Feng suddenly clenched his palm, and with a ‘puu,’ the eyes in his hands were crushed.

“Eeeaahhhh~~~”

At that moment, Linghu Hongfei’s scream became even more miserable.
