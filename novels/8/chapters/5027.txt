Chapter 5027: Entering the City

Chu Feng had met many wealthy young masters who acted like beasts. Judging from the reactions of the populace living near Lush Immortal City, he reckoned that such events didn’t occur frequently in the past.

Otherwise, they wouldn’t have continued living there.

There must be some kind of trigger that caused such tragedies to happen all of a sudden, and Chu Feng couldn’t help but relate it to the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

He soon arrived outside Lush Immortal City, which was a city floating amidst the clouds. It didn’t seem like a heavenly palace despite its size due to its tattered appearance. The walls and buildings inside were also made out of soil.

In fact, many of the walls had cracks on them, and some of the infrastructures within the city appeared to be on the verge of collapse. Nevertheless, there was still a huge crowd moving to and fro this tattered city.

Just by standing there, Chu Feng could spot an endless stream of cultivators entering and leaving the city. All of them were juniors.

Chu Feng was currently scanning the perimeter of Lush Immortal City to see if there were anyone from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect in the vicinity. Under normal circumstances, it would be safe to assume that a young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had people protecting him.

After a quick look around, Chu Feng began making his way toward the city. Before he could step in, he felt some kind of mysterious energy in front of him coming from a formation.

To be clear, there was an ancient formation around the city that emanated the aura of the Ancient Era, but the one that Chu Feng had passed through wasn’t it. He could tell that the formation was constructed in recent days.

As a world spiritist himself, Chu Feng could tell that it was a formation that scanned one’s martial power. Most likely, his cultivation level had already been exposed.

“There’s indeed something going on.”

Chu Feng proceeded deeper into the city as if nothing had happened, but he already had an idea of what was going on.

The formation was actually rather discreet even though Chu Feng was able to detect it. It proved that the world spiritist behind the formation was fairly powerful. It was hard to believe that a world spiritist of that caliber would be so bored as to construct a formation around Lush Immortal City for no good reason.

Thus, he guessed that the formation around Lush Immortal City was constructed by those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect in order to surveil the people entering the city.

Chu Feng was right.

There was a floating warship hidden from sight outside Lush Immortal City, and there were quite a few people gathered at its bow. They were from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

Most of them stood at attention, indicating that they were guards, but there were two of them who were clearly of high standing.

One of them was a black-haired elder with his long hair pinned above his head. He was advanced in age, but his cheeks retained a healthy glow that made him look youthful.

Beside him was a white-haired elder. He had his hair scattered all around like a ferocious lion. His eyes were closed, but his sharp snowy eyebrows gave off an intimidating appearance. He appeared to be taking a brief rest instead of cultivating.

From the moment Chu Feng stepped into Lush Immortal City, the white-haired elder opened his eyes and stared at him.

“Milord, what’s wrong?” the black-haired elder asked.

“A rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator has just entered Lush Immortal City,” the white-haired elder replied.

“A rank four Martial Exalted level junior? Does the eastern junior even have a prodigy of such caliber? Could he be from the other galaxies?” the black-haired elder asked.

“There is such a possibility… The question is what is he doing here?” the white-haired elder said contemplatively.

“Is he here for young master Kongping?” the black-haired elder asked worriedly.

“Hahaha!”

The white-haired elder burst into laughter upon hearing those words.

“Even though young master Kongping is playful, his talent is top-notch in our Pill Dao Immortal Sect. No matter how indolent he is, he’s not someone whom a mere rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator could deal with. You need not worry about that.

“Putting aside a rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator, even a rank five couldn’t hope to injure young master Kongping!” the white-haired elder said confidently.

“That’s true. There’s no need for us to worry given young master Kongping’s strength. I must have really gotten foolish to actually worry about young master Kongping over a mere rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator,” the black-haired elder said.

The white-haired elder closed his eyes once more.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had entered Lush Immortal City, and he found that it was much larger than he had thought. There were many entertainment avenues and cultivation spots inside it.

Out of fear of alarming the enemy, he didn’t take out Jiang Kongping’s painting and go around asking the crowd on the street for his whereabouts. Instead, he spread his spirit power out thin to listen into the crowd’s conversation so as to gather intelligence.

There were many people in the city, so there was a lot of noise. Fortunately, Chu Feng’s mind was strong enough to filter out the useless ones.

Anyone else in the same position would have gone berserk attempting the same method.

It was just that there was no information about Jiang Kongping. While he was listening in to the conversations of others, he arrived at the corner of the street.

There, he found a bunch of people gathered around a tall chair. The chair was ten meters tall, such that it was possible to see it from a distance away despite the crowd around it.

A lady was sitting on the chair. She had an ordinary appearance and was dressed like a little beggar. She held a crystal ball between her hands.

The crystal ball was around the size of a palm, and a peculiar surge of energy was flowing through it.

Chu Feng widened his eyes in astonishment. He sensed that the energy inside the crystal ball had the power to peer through fate. It was not by luck that he had made his way here. Rather, he had overheard from information that had piqued his curiosity, and that led his feet here.

The woman on the chair was prophesying the future of the Nine Souls Galaxy. Thus far, she had already proclaimed that a calamity would soon befall it, and the next thing she was going to prophesy was whether the calamity could be resolved.

The crowd was gathered around her not because they believed her words. They were simply joining in the commotion. After all, one would have to be really naive to believe the words of a random self-proclaimed seer foretelling an imminent apocalypse.

Weng!

The crystal ball suddenly glowed brilliantly. The woman took in a deep breath, and the light drifted into her mouth in a whiff of smoke.

Then, she opened her eyes.

Despite the woman’s ordinary appearance, her eyes were incredibly beautiful. She had long eyelashes, and her pupils were filled with spirit. On top of that, she had heterochromatic eyes. Her left eye was black but her right eye was white.
