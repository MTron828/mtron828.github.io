Chapter 4470: Chu Feng’s Grandfather

Chu Feng was no longer alone in the hall anymore. There was a figure standing right in front of the chair inside the hall.

This figure was an old man with snowy hair. He wore a set of robe that was whiter than pure snow, giving him a distinguished and tidy appearance. He commanded a transcendental aura that seemed untouched by the mortal world, making him reminiscent of an immortal.

Even if one were to just look at this appearance, it was already apparent that this old man was no ordinary person.

It was just that his entire figure was translucent, indicating that he was not a complete lifeform. It was likely that he was a soul, but he was no ordinary soul either. To be more exact, he was an existence whom Chu Feng was unable to accurately discern.

From this old man, Chu Feng sensed something deeply formidable coming from his aura, and that was the scent of the Ancient Era.

The scent was very strong, which hinted that he was not just a descendant of someone who had lived in the Ancient Era. Most likely, he was an existence who had survived from the Ancient Era to this day.

“Junior Chu Feng pays respect to elder!”

Chu Feng knew nothing about the old man before him, but he dared not to show any disrespect. He quickly stepped forward and bowed to the old man.

He felt that it was very likely that the old man knew something about his grandfather.

“Don’t. This old man is unworthy of your bow. If we were to go by strict hierarchies, you are my young master. How can I have my young master bowing to me?”

As soon as Chu Feng lowered his back, the old man instantaneously appeared before Chu Feng and held him up.

Even though the old man was in the state of a soul, his strength was unfathomable great.

“Elder, do you know my grandfather?” Chu Feng asked.

While Chu Feng had his guesses, he wanted to clarify the matter so as to be certain.

“We didn’t just know one another.”

There was a faint yet wistful smile on the lips of the old man as he said those words calmly.

When Chu Feng heard those words, he couldn’t maintain his composure anymore. The old man’s answer had ascertained his guesses.

This place was really related to his grandfather, and the Chu Hanxian mentioned on the map was indubitably his grandfather.

“Elder, do you know where my grandfather is at the moment?” Chu Feng grabbed the arms of the old man out of agitation and asked.

“Take a deep breath and calm down first,” the old man told Chu Feng with a light smile.

It was not for no reason that he said that. Chu Feng’s body had started to tremble, and his eyes were extremely intense. He seemed to have lost control of his emotions.

Those who knew Chu Feng would surely be surprised to see him in his current state.

He had always been able to keep his cool regardless of the situation he was in, and it was rare for him to lose himself like that.

On the other hand, Chu Feng also realized that he had gotten a little too agitated after hearing what the old man said. He quickly released his grip on the old man’s arm.

“Pardon me, elder. I was a little too brash. It’s just that I’m simply too anxious to know about my grandfather’s affairs. Elder, can you tell me if my grandfather is still here at the moment?” Chu Feng asked.

“I believe that you should already have an answer in your mind when you asked that question,” the old man replied.

“So, my grandfather is not here?”

Indeed, Chu Feng did think that it was unlikely for his grandfather to be here. Otherwise, the one who was meeting him at the moment wouldn’t have just been this old man.

Since his grandfather was nowhere to be seen at the moment, it was likely that he was no longer here.

Despite have such guesses in his mind, Chu Feng still bore a sliver of hope in his mind, hoping that he might have deduced wrongly.

However, as fate would have it, he was doomed to be disappointed. It seemed like he was not destined to meet his grandfather, Chu Hanxian, today.

“It has been almost a thousand years since he left this place,” the old man said.

“Almost a thousand years? Elder, do you remember exactly how many years has it been since my grandfather left here?” Chu Feng asked on.

“I can’t remember it clearly anymore, but it should be slightly less than a thousand years,” the old man replied.

“I see. Elder, you should know some of the affairs surrounding my grandfather, right? Can you tell me what you know about him?” Chu Feng asked.

“It looks like you’re really concerned about your grandfather. To be frank, I was really surprised to see you. I didn’t think that Chu Hanxian would actually be a grandfather. When I sensed you coming near to this area, I thought that you were his son. Time sure passes swiftly. Back when I knew him, he was still a junior,” the old man remarked deeply with a smile.

“A junior? You’re saying that my grandfather was still a junior when you first met him?”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s curiosity was piqued.

While he still had some information regarding his father, he knew close to nothing about his grandfather. Yet, this old man was saying that he knew his grandfather when his grandfather was still young.

Judging from what the old man said, it had been a thousand years since his grandfather left this area.

But based on what Chu Feng knew, his grandfather was a cultivator in the same generation as Supreme Elder Chu Hanpeng, which meant that his grandfather should be over ten thousand years old in age by now.

This would mean that this old man had known his grandfather for a good 9000 years before they lost touch a thousand years ago! This was more than enough to highlight their close ties with one another!

Surely the old man would know a lot of things about his grandfather if that was the case!

Even if his grandfather was no longer here, it would still have been a fruitful trip here if he could learn more about his grandfather from this old man over here.

“Indeed. The first time I saw your grandfather, he was still a junior around your age. A brat of his cultivation level was actually able to get into this hidden place; I was really surprised then!”

There was a distant look in the eyes of the old man as he spoke, and he stroked his beard reminiscently. It seemed like memories of the past were gushing into his head.

On the other hand, Chu Feng was finding it hard to hold himself back anymore.

“Elder, can you tell me what you know about my grandfather?” Chu Feng asked.

His tone carried a hint of a plea in it. He was simply too curious to know about his grandfather.

“Why are you so curious about your grandfather’s affair? Has your grandfather never mentioned anything about his past to you?” the old man asked in bewilderment.

“To be honest with you, elder, I have never met my grandfather before. He has gone missing for many years, and I have no idea what his current state is. What I know about him is very limited,” Chu Feng said.

“Oh? You have never met your grandfather before?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Hearing those words, the old man reined in his smile, and a deep crease formed on his forehead. Complicated emotions rippled in the depths of his eyes.

There were hints of sorrow and worry.

He seemed to have recalled something.

“Haa, I had advised him not to do it. Did something really happen to him?” the old man murmured with a deep sigh.
