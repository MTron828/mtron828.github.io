Chapter 2471 - Encountering An Old Friend

“This group of people should be from the same power. This is a perfect opportunity, I can ask them about the situation in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

As Chu Feng wanted to ask them about the situation in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he decided to stop and wait for them to arrive.

Then, as he was bored, he began to read their lips to see what they were talking about.

It was as Chu Feng had guessed: those people were from the same power. They were from a place called the Jade Mountain Sect.

The Sect Master of the Jade Mountain Sect was an old man with a cultivation of rank four Martial Ancestor.

At that moment, the Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master had gathered practically all of their elites. With him personally leading them, they were moving to suppress a hostile power.

When they mentioned that hostile power, they mentioned a person’s name.

Chu Feng was surprised to see that name.

“Liu Xiaoli?”

Chu Feng was extremely familiar with that name. The reason for that was because the Society Master of the Red Butterfly Society was named Liu Xiaoli.

Furthermore, from the conversations of the Jade Mountain Sect members, Chu Feng found out that the Liu Xiaoli they were talking about was also a woman.

Furthermore, she possessed the cultivation of a rank two Martial Ancestor, a cultivation very close to that of the Liu Xiaoli Chu Feng knew.

When Chu Feng had left Liu Xiaoli back then, she had only been a rank one Martial Ancestor. However, she possessed outstanding talent. Thus, it was very possible for her to be a rank two Martial Ancestor at the moment.

“Perhaps it might just be a coincidence. There are countless people in the world with the same name and surname.”

“Furthermore, no matter where the Red Butterfly Society’s bunch move to, they couldn’t possibly have moved to here, no?” Her Lady Queen said.

“Perhaps it is a coincidence, but might also not be a coincidence. After all, their descriptions of Liu Xiaoli resemble the Liu Xiaoli that we know too much. Since I’ve encountered this matter, I will go and have a look,” After Chu Feng finished saying these words, he entered the void and concealed himself.

With Chu Feng’s current level of cultivation, if he wanted to conceal himself, it would be very difficult for anyone below the True Immortal level of cultivation to discover him.

Soon, the group of people from the Jade Mountain Sect moved past Chu Feng and continued onward.

They had not discovered in the slightest that someone had been hiding in the void and then snuck into their ranks, following them.

Following that group of people, Chu Feng soon passed through the vast plain and arrived at a great mountain.

Through observing with his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng discovered that there was a sect inside the mountain.

That sect did not possess many people, and also contained very few palaces. Furthermore, everything was very new. Likely, it had all been recently constructed.

At that moment, the sect was surrounded by five different powers.

Thus, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Jade Mountain Sect that he had followed should have come to besiege and attack that sect.

Adding them all up, there were a total of six powers besieging and attacking that sect.

Fortunately, the two sides were only standing in confrontation at that moment. and had yet to actually start battling.

However, as that sect was currently facing enemies on all sides by itself, it did appear that it was facing imminent danger.

That said, that sect master’s expression actually remained unchanged even though they were besieged by five powers and five rank three Martial Ancestors.

Most importantly, that sect’s master only possessed the cultivation of a rank two Martial Ancestor.

Compared to the masters of the five powers, that sect’s master was a level of cultivation weaker.

Most importantly, that sect master was a female.

While her appearance was different from Liu Xiaoli, Chu Feng was able to recognize with a single glance that she was Liu Xiaoli. She had merely altered her appearance. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Not only had Liu Xiaoli altered her appearance, but the elders standing beside her were actually also the Red Butterfly Society’s elders. Merely, they too altered their appearances like Liu Xiaoli.

“It really is them,” After ascertaining that it was Liu Xiaoli, Chu Feng was overjoyed.

After all, it could be said that he had experienced life and death with Liu Xiaoli and the others. How could Chu Feng not be overjoyed to run into them again?

“What a coincidence, it really is them.” At that moment, Her Lady Queen was also very surprised. As she spoke, one could actually feel excitement in her tone.

After all, back then, Chu Feng had only just arrived in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. His cultivation was still very weak back then. Furthermore, things were made difficult for him by Luyang’s Pavilion. Yet, at such a time, the Red Butterfly Society had offered him a helping hand.

That said, while she was happy, Her Lady Queen also started to ponder. She looked to the banner floating above Liu Xiaoli’s sect, the banner with the name of ‘De-cocoon Sect’ and said, “Why would they change their name from Red Butterfly Society to De-cocoon Sect? Could it be that their strength has suffered greatly after what happened last time, and they are thus planning to break free from their cocoons for a rebirth?”

“Wouldn’t we know when we ask them about it?” As Chu Feng spoke, he suddenly accelerated. In a blink of an eye, he entered the mountain and arrived before Liu Xiaoli and the others.

However, Chu Feng did not immediately reveal himself. Rather, he stood beside his old friend.

He wanted to see exactly what the group of powers that surrounded Liu Xiaoli and the others wanted to do. He also wanted to make sure of what was going on first.

“Liu Xiaoli, bring your De-cocoon Sect and leave Mount Modang immediately. Do that, and we will consider nothing to have happened.”

“Otherwise, do not blame us for being impolite,” The masters of the five powers said to Liu Xiaoli.

“Impolite? I wish to see how you all plan to be impolite toward me.”

As Liu Xiaoli spoke, a majestic aura swept forth from her body. The next moment, the sky changed color.

It was Divine Power. After Liu Xiaoli unleashed her Divine Power, her cultivation increased from rank two Martial Ancestor to rank three Martial Ancestor.

She had reached the same level of cultivation as the masters of those five powers.

However, most importantly, Liu Xiaoli’s aura was not only limited to that of a rank three Martial Ancestor.

Apart from her cultivation of rank three Martial Ancestor, Liu Xiaoli was also emitting heaven-defying battle power. Although her heaven-defying battle power was only capable of surmounting one level of cultivation, when added to her current cultivation of rank three Martial Ancestor, her actual battle power was on par with ordinary rank four Martial Ancestors.

“Sure enough, that girl was concealing her strength.”

Upon sensing Liu Xiaoli’s cultivation, not to mention the others that were besieging her sect, even the masters of the five powers involuntarily moved backwards and revealed fear on their faces.

“Are you all still planning to drive me out now?” Liu Xiaoli asked coldly.

However, her question was not met with a single answer from the five powers.

“Everyone, our De-cocoon Sect has decided to establish ourselves here because we discovered that Mount Modang was uninhabited.”

“Furthermore, the world of martial cultivation is a world where the weak are prey to the strong. Our De-cocoon Sect has merely expanded our territory slightly, and did not attempt to devour you all, our neighboring powers. As such, we were already being extremely benevolent and attentive.”

“Thus, it is best that you all not continue to be so aggressive. Else... it will not be you who will be impolite toward our De-cocoon Sect, but rather us who will be impolite towards you,” Liu Xiaoli said to the crowd.

After hearing those words, Chu Feng finally realized why those powers had joined hands to besiege Liu Xiaoli and the others.

As it turned out, it was due to a territorial conflict.

Evidently, Liu Xiaoli had only arrived recently, whereas those powers that were besieging her were most likely old and well-known powers in the vicinity.

They felt that the appearance of Liu Xiaoli and her sect served as a threat to their status. Thus, they had decided to besiege Liu Xiaoli and the others.

However, after Liu Xiaoli revealed her strength, those five powers all revealed fear.

Although they possessed very great numbers, they knew very well that the world of martial cultivation was one where not just numbers could determine the outcome of a battle.

Merely Liu Xiaoli by herself would be able to exterminate all of the elites of their five powers.

However, even with that being the case, they did not leave immediately. Rather, they seemed to be waiting for something.
