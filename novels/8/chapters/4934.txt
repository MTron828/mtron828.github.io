Chapter 4934: The Way to Save Them

“The vast world of cultivation does have many hidden experts. I am still too weak,” Chu Feng lamented.

Putting aside the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, even these red-cloaked figures and the Netherworld Sect were enough to squeeze the life out of him. He still had a long way to go!

Since it was impossible for him to deal with the red-cloaked figures anytime soon, he decided not to pay this matter any heed.&nbsp;

He took out the Ancient Era Realm Soulstone, but he gave it to Daoist Niantian instead of Master Yin Ren.

“Daoist Niantian, please have a look at this stone. According to what I’ve heard, Master Yin Ren is intending to use this stone to replace the formation inside Princess Xiaoxiao’s body. I sense that there are other uses to this stone other than that, but I’m unable to fully discern it. I’d like to ask elder to help me take a look at it.”

Daoist Niantian took the stone and examined it.

In the meantime, Chu Feng turned to Master Yin Ren and asked, “I heard that you know the way to extract Miaomiao’s soul safely from Princess Xiaoxiao’s body?”

He had noticed that Master Yin Ren had used a special method to fuse Xian Miaomiao’s soul into Princess Xiaoxiao’s body, such that it would require a counterpart skill in order to extract it too. Otherwise, it would be extremely dangerous for both Xian Miaomiao and Princess Xiaoxiao.

That was why he needed to seek Master Yin Ren’s help for this matter. Not even Daoist Niantian would be able to help him with this.&nbsp;

“Young friend Chu Feng, Princess Xiaoxiao has no intention of assimilating Princess Miaomiao’s soul. She’s just using Princess Miaomiao’s soul to extend her lifespan for the time being so as to…” Master Yin Ren began to explain the matter.

However, Princess Xiaoxiao suddenly interjected, “Master Yin Ren, do as Chu Feng says.”

Master Yin Ren’s expression visibly stiffened, but he quickly accepted the matter and turned to look at Chu Feng.

“Young friend Chu Feng, just to clarify, your intention is to disregard Princess Xiaoxiao’s safety and return Princess Miaomiao’s freedom as soon as possible?”

Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, and Daoist Niantian also turned their gazes toward Chu Feng.

They had heard Master Yin Ren’s words before Chu Feng entered the hidden realm to look for Princess Xiaoxiao, so they were aware that Chu Feng was acquainted with Princess Xiaoxiao.

Given that he had ties with the two of them, it would be difficult for him to choose between them.&nbsp;

However, Chu Feng’s decision clearly showed who was more important to him.

“I would have nothing to say if Miaomiao has voluntarily offered her help, but she was forced into this. I wish to return her freedom right now,” Chu Feng said.

Princess Xiaoxiao was mentally prepared for that, but she couldn’t stop her heart from sinking when she heard those words.&nbsp;

“Young friend Chu Feng, I understand your intention now. However, I’d like to clarify that I can only take an auxiliary role when extracting Princess Miaomiao’s soul from Princess Xiaoxiao’s body. I require the help of another person in order to make it happen.

“Is young friend Chu Feng acquainted with any junior world spiritist who has reached rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation?” Master Yin Ren asked.

“You’re saying that we’ll need a junior world spiritist who has reached rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation in order to extract Miaomiao’s soul from Princess Xiaoxiao’s body?” Chu Feng asked with a frown.

“That’s indeed the case,” Master Yin Ren replied.

Boom!

A powerful oppressive might crushed down on Master Yin Ren’s body the next moment.

It was Shengguang Baimei.

At the same time, he pulled Daoist Zhang and the elder from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan out of his Cosmos Sack. They were still in a pitiful state at the moment.

They thought that Shengguang Baimei was going to continue torturing them, so they kneeled to the ground and pleaded for mercy.

Princess Xiaoxiao widened her eyes in horror upon seeing their pitiful plight.&nbsp;

She had just returned from the hidden realm, so she was unaware of the conditions Daoist Zhang and the elder from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan were in. She had no idea the threat Shengguang Baimei posed to them.&nbsp;

It was only at this moment that she realized that both she and Master Yin Ren were as good as prisoners. They had no choice but to obey Chu Feng’s orders.&nbsp;

“Haven’t we been respectful to you thus far? Do we have to do this to you before you’re willing to heed our words?”&nbsp;

Shengguang Baimei glared at Master Yin Ren coldly.

He thought that Master Yin Ren was lying because he didn’t want to extract Xian Miaomiao’s soul from Princess Miaomiao’s body. In the entire Holy Light Galaxy, the only one who had reached rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation was Daoist Niantian.&nbsp;

It was practically impossible to find a junior world spiritist who had reached rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation!

Even in the Nine Souls Galaxy, which had more talented world spiritists than the Holy Light Galaxy, it would be nigh impossible to find a junior world spiritist who had reached rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation too.

Wasn’t Master Yin Ren simply asking the impossible out of Chu Feng?”

“Milord, I’m being perfectly honest here. This is the blueprint for my formation. Young friend Chu Feng and Daoist Niantian are free to have a look at it and verify if there’s any falsehood in my words.”

Master Yin Ren was a person with spunk. Despite Shengguang Baimei’s threat, he was still able to remain unfazed. He took out an ancient scroll and passed it over to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng unfurled the scroll and saw the blueprint to an ancient formation. Daoist Niantian also walked over to take a look.&nbsp;

The blueprint did detail a formation that allowed one to use a person’s soul to preserve the life of another.&nbsp;

What Master Yin Ren mentioned was the truth.&nbsp;

He could fuse the two souls together by himself, but extracting them was a far more complicated process with stricter restrictions. It had to be done by a rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation junior, and that was already the minimum requirement.&nbsp;

“Lord Baimei, you may retract your oppressive might,” Daoist Niantian said.

Those words meant that Master Yin Ren was telling the truth, so there was no need to exert force on him.

“Hmph!”

However, Shengguang Baimei didn’t do as he was told. He glared at Master Yin Ren with increasingly hostile eyes.&nbsp;
