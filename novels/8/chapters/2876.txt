Chapter 2876 - Chu Feng’s Attack

“Chu Feng, have you gone deaf? Have you not heard the identity of those two young ladies?”

“The two of them are Grandmaster Liangqiu’s last disciples!”

“Do you not know the distinguished Grandmaster Liangqiu?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s alright if that’s the case. I will explain it to you. Grandmaster Liangqiu is the strongest world spiritist in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Listen carefully: he’s the strongest world spiritist in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. It is the Ancestral Martial Starfield that I’m talking about here, not the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

“Do you understand what this means? Do you know what this represents?”

One of the Starfall Holy Land’s male disciples said to Chu Feng.

“I understand,” Chu Feng said.

“If you understand, then why aren’t you getting back here? Could it be that you want to seek humiliation?” That male disciple asked.

“Who told you that I’m definitely going to lose?” Chu Feng asked.

“What?”

Once Chu Feng said those words, not only did the two Starfall Holy Land’s disciples reveal an expression of shock, but even Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciples revealed a change in their expressions.

Evidently, they, like everyone else present, did not anticipate Chu Feng saying this sort of thing.

“Impudent! How could Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciples be allowed to be insulted by you?!”

“Xingyi, look at what kind of helper you’ve brought back!”

“Scram! Get the hell out of here immediately!”

Elder Tuoba shouted furiously.

Those two women possessed truly extraordinary statuses. Not even their Starfall Holy Land would dare to offend them.

Yet Chu Feng, while fully knowing who they were, actually dared to still make such a declaration.

Elder Tuoba felt what Chu Feng said was simply an act of disgrace, simply going to court a major disaster.

“You want me to scram? I’m sorry, but I was not invited here by you. Thus, you do not have the qualifications to tell me to scram,” Chu Feng replied in a disapproving manner.

“What did you say?! You dare to speak to me in such a manner?!” Hearing those words, Elder Tuoba was immediately furious.

“Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, please quell your anger, please quell your anger.”

Seeing that the situation was turning bad, Elder Xingyi hurriedly flew over to Chu Feng’s side and shielded Chu Feng behind him. He was extremely worried that his Utmost Exalted Elder would smash Chu Feng to death.

At that moment, Xia Yun’er also walked over to Chu Feng’s side.

“Chu Feng, just forget about it.”

“You’ve come here to help me obtain the inheritance, there is no need for you to set yourself against everyone for a spar,” Xia Yun’er urged Chu Feng with a low voice.

“Obtain the inheritance?” Chu Feng chuckled. Then, he said, “Right now, your Utmost Exalted Elder is already scared. He wouldn’t even dare to speak properly in fear of offending them. Yet, you still want to obtain the inheritance?”

“At that time, if they were to give you all an eye, would any of you dare to compete with them in obtaining the inheritance?”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng turned to the two Starfall Holy Land’s male disciples. He pointed at them and asked, “You two, do you dare to compete against them?”

The two men wanted to say something. However, in the end, they lowered their heads silently.

They indeed did not dare.

“Asura World Spiritist, what about you? Do you dare to compete against them?” Chu Feng pointed to Asura Zhao Kun and asked.

“Humph,” Asura Zhao Kun snorted coldly. However, he did not answer Chu Feng.

His behavior was one of evasion. This meant that he did not dare to go against Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciples for a mere inheritance.

“Did you see that? They do not even dare to attempt to compete. Thus, why bother going in?”

“You might as well just hand it over to the Nine Profound Sect directly.”

Chu Feng turned his gaze back to Xia Yun’er.

At that moment, Xia Yun’er did not know how to answer Chu Feng.

No one would’ve expected the Nine Profound Sect to be able to actually request the assistance of Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciples.

Not to mention people like Xia Yun’er and the others, it was likely not even their Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Ruler would dare to offend Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciples.

“Impudent! Truly impudent! Xingyi, Xia Yun’er, look at what sort of person you two have invited!”

“Men! Drive him out! Kick him out immediately!”

Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was Elder Tuoba.

Right after Elder Tuoba finished saying those words, many elders flew over to Chu Feng and surrounded him. They had an attitude of planning to drive Chu Feng out by force.

“Wait,” right at that moment, that blue-haired woman suddenly spoke.

Her words were like an order. The Starfall Holy Land’s elders that were planning to drive Chu Feng out all stood there stunned.

At that moment, the blue-haired woman walked over to Chu Feng and inspected him carefully. Then, she said, “You wish to compete against me in terms of world spirit techniques?”

“No, it is not that I want to compete against you in terms of world spirit techniques,” Chu Feng answered.

Once Chu Feng said those words, Elder Tuoba was so enraged that his face started twitching. Even the Starfall Holy Land’s two male disciples were gnashing their teeth furiously.

If Chu Feng was not planning to compete with her, then why bother speaking? Was this not deliberately causing trouble?

“Then what do you want?” The blue-haired woman asked.

“I was asked to come here. Thus, I possess an obligation to stick up for my employer. You’ve defeated my employer, thus, I must retrieve justice for her,” as Chu Feng spoke, he took a glance at Xia Yun’er.

Hearing those words, Xia Yun’er’s eyes actually shone. A complicated expression emerged on her exceptionally beautiful face.

It turned out that Chu Feng had braved such enormous risk not to show off, but rather to retrieve justice for her.

“You’re quite interesting. Very well, I will satisfy you this once. You attack and I defend. Go ahead.”

As the woman spoke, she took a leap back and landed across from Chu Feng.

Seeing this, the people that had surrounded Chu Feng turned their gazes to Elder Tuoba.

“Miss Liangqiu is planning to take on that fool, why are you all not moving aside?” Elder Tuoba said.

It was only after Elder Tuoba said those words that Elder Xingyi and the others left Chu Feng’s side, leaving sufficient room for Chu Feng and that blue-haired woman to spar.

“Humph, overestimating one’s capabilities.”

“I will see how you humiliate yourself.”

Asura Zhao Kun was looking at Chu Feng as if he were looking at a clown.

In fact, it was not only him. With the exception of Xia Yun’er and Elder Xingyi, practically everyone else was looking at Chu Feng with that sort of gaze.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, that blue-haired woman waved her sleeve, and that same defensive formation once again appeared and enveloped her within it.

It was the same defensive formation that had blocked Asura Zhao Kun and Xia Yun’er’s offensive formations.

“You have an incense stick’s worth of time. You can begin,” that blue-haired woman said.

“There’s no need for that.”

Chu Feng smiled. As he spoke, he pinched his thumb and index finger together. Immediately, spirit power started to surge between his two fingers.

Soon, a pea-sized golden sphere appeared between Chu Feng’s two fingers.

“This would do,” Chu Feng said.

“What? What is that?”

“Is he playing a joke here? He’s actually planning to use such a lousy spirit formation to attack Miss Liangqiu’s defensive formation?”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the people of the younger generation present all felt disbelief, and then burst out in laughter.

In fact, even that blue-haired woman asked Chu Feng, “Are you certain?”

“I am,” Chu Feng replied.

“Hahaha,” right at that moment, a sweet-sounding laugh was suddenly heard. It was from the red-haired woman, who had been silent the entire time.

“Big sister, you are being looked down upon,” that red-haired woman said with a teasing tone.

As for the blue-haired woman, she was angered by how Chu Feng had looked down on her. Thus, with an ill-intended tone, she said, “You will pay for this.”

“Am I allowed to attack now?” Chu Feng asked.

“You are. You can attack right now,” that blue-haired woman spoke with displeasure.

“That fool, he’s truly here to humiliate our Starfall Holy Land!”

At that moment, the Starfall Holy Land’s two male disciples started to shake their heads and sigh. They both felt that Chu Feng was deliberately toying with them.

“Brother Tuoba, excuse my honesty. Requesting such trash is only going to ruin your Starfall Holy Land’s reputation,” Zhao Kuangfengyi said to Elder Tuoba.

Hearing those words, Elder Tuoba, who was furious to begin with, grew even more furious.

He took a fierce glance at Elder Xingyi and Xia Yun’er. Grievances filled his eyes.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Chu Feng flicked his finger, and a golden light shot forth. Soon, that golden light arrived before the blue-haired woman’s defensive formation.

“Bang!” A loud explosion was heard, and then a violent wind emerged. That blue-haired woman actually took several steps back.

At that moment, apart from Chu Feng, the expressions of everyone present changed enormously.

The reason for that was because that blue-haired woman’s defensive formation had been shattered!!!
