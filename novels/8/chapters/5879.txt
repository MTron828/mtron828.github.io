Chapter 5880: Protect Yourself Well

“Elder Sheng, what do you mean?” The middle-aged man finally sensed that something was amiss.

“I’m worried that Chu Feng will beat Fengliu to death,” the colossal being replied.

“Surely not. There’s no way Chu Feng can match Fengliu. Taking a thousand steps back, even if Chu Feng overpowers Fengliu, does he dare to kill him? He should be able to tell by now that we’re testing him. It will take a lot of guts for him to kill our junior despite knowing that,” the middle-aged man said.

“Just because he knows courtesy doesn’t mean that he’s a coward. Chu Feng is known to be very bold,” the colossal being replied.

“Bold? I don’t believe he’d be this bold! In the first place, I don’t think that Fengliu will lose. Elder Sheng, you should have more confidence in our Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s juniors!” the middle-aged man said.

The colossal being fell silent.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was deciphering a formation.

After leaving behind Zi Ling and entering the spirit formation gate, he found himself inside a cavern. He ventured deeper into the cavern and encountered many similar formations that could be breached by both martial power and spirit power.

Chu Feng thought that it was too easy to breach those formations with his spirit power, so he used his martial power instead.

He had a strong understanding of formations as a world spiritist, so it wasn’t too hard for him to achieve the same results with martial power. It didn’t take him long to unravel the formation.

Once the formation was unraveled, the spirit power contained within it manifested into a spirit formation gate. Unfortunately, the stone gate blocking him from venturing deeper into the cavern remained sealed.

He had to enter the spirit formation gate and clear its trial to venture further into the cavern.

Thus, he stepped into the spirit formation gate and found himself entering a cavern. This cavern was incredibly broad, and it looked like it had been sculpted before. It resembled an underground hall crudely built by barbarians.

Chu Feng noticed two spirit formation gates. One was located deeper inside the cavern and was closed. The other one was located on his left and was open.

At the center of this cavern was a platform with a box on it. The platform was sealed by a formation, so Chu Feng couldn’t tell what was inside the box.

A three–meter–tall, white-haired man with a slender frame was standing in front of the box.

This white-haired man breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing Chu Feng. “It took you so long to reach here. Is this the arrogance of the present-era cultivator?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Those words were spoken in a murmur as if he was talking to himself.

“Who are you?” Chu Feng asked.

He sensed the hostility in the other party’s words, so he didn’t show any respect either. That was how he had always been. No matter who the other party was, he would only show respect to the other party if they were respectful to him too.

“Hoh! Look at your tone. You must have been a truly arrogant one. Stop pulling your weight in front of me. I don’t have the time to deal with your antics. This treasure will be mine as long as I defeat you!” the white-haired man sneered.

Without any hesitation, he conjured a formation sword with a bright flash of light and charged at Chu Feng.

The white-haired man was at Exalted Dragon God-cloak, but his spirit power was comparable to a Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist!

Chu Feng raised his hand and unleashed a torrent of spirit power too. His spirit power manifested into countless swords that charged at the white-haired man’s formation sword.

“Immortal Dragon God-cloak?” The white-haired man was taken aback.

He hadn’t held back at all as he knew his opponent was likely to be powerful, so he was surprised to learn that the latter was only at Immortal Dragon God-cloak.

Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists were comparable to rank seven Half-God level cultivators, whereas his spirit power was on par with rank nine Half-God level cultivators. This meant that his enemy was weaker than the ones he had previously faced.

Do the present-era cultivators only amount to this much? The white-haired man wondered.

Weng!

Chu Feng’s rain of swords clashed with the white-haired man’s massive formation sword. The rain of swords twirled around the massive sword like a snake coiling around a tree, holding it in place.

But it only took half of the sword rain to control the massive formation sword. The remaining half charged straight at the white-haired man.

The white-haired man was excited to see that.

“I see. You’re hiding your true strength. Very well. This makes things more exciting! This trial is indeed different from before,” the white-haired man remarked.

With a wave of his sleeves, he constructed a protective formation in front of him. He was confident that this formation was enough to block the rain of swords.

Soon, the rain of swords struck the protective formation.

The swords either shattered or fell to the ground. They were powerless against the protective formation, almost like slabs of tofu being hurled against a rock.

The white-haired man wasn’t surprised; he had expected this to happen.

Suddenly, the remaining swords that hadn’t clashed with the protective barrier became much faster and stronger, piercing through the protective barrier and going straight at the white-haired man.

The white-haired man was caught off guard. By the time he understood what was going on, the swords were already too close for him to fight back.

Most of the swords passed by him, but there were still a dozen that plunged into him. The sheer momentum of those words pushed his figure backward. In the blink of an eye, he was bloodied all over.

“You bastard!” the white-haired man roared after regaining his balance.

Not only did he not attempt to heal up, but he even unleashed his killing intent too. Just then, the open spirit formation gate unleashed a powerful suction force that dragged the white-haired man away.

At the same time, the formation protecting the platform vanished.

...

The black-haired man was waiting outside the spirit formation gate.

All of a sudden, the spirit formation gate rippled, and the white-haired man was hurled out.

“What happened? Why are you so severely injured? Are you fine? Are you going to die?” The black-haired man anxiously rushed over to support the white-haired man.

“I’m fine. I got careless,” the white-haired man replied.

“Careless?” The black-haired man frowned. He sensed that things weren’t that simple.

The white-haired man had been through many of such trials, but this was the first time he had sustained such severe injuries. Even if he had gotten careless, there was no doubt that this trial was harder than those before.

...

Meanwhile, the middle-aged man and the colossal being saw the white-haired man’s plight through a pair of unique eyes.

The middle-aged man frowned. He wasn’t saying a word, but his expression showed that countless words lingered at the tip of his tongue.

“What do you think?” the colossal being asked.

“He was too harsh. Chu Xuanyuan’s son is indeed too much! How dare he act so arrogantly in my turf? He must be tired of living!” the middle-aged man roared in anger.

“He has already shown mercy by avoiding a fatal attack. Why don’t we just call it quits? There’s no point sending Hongliang in just to get beaten,” the colossal being said.

“I don’t believe that Hongliang will lose too. Fengliu is from our Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s bloodline; it’s only normal for his world spiritist bloodline to be lacking compared to a human. Hongliang won’t let us down too.”

The middle-aged man first formed a hand seal before saying, “Hongliang, it’s your turn to enter. Remember not to get careless. Try to fight near the spirit formation gate. If things go wrong, retreat right away. There’s no need to fight to your death. Your survival comes first.”

At the same time, the spirit formation gate rippled once more.
