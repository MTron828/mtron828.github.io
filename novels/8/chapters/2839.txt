Chapter 2839 - No Going Back

“Brother Xiaoyao, brother Chu Feng has yet to even say anything, how could you know that he is going to refuse you?”

“For you to speak ill of brother Chu Feng so arbitrarily, it is a bit excessive, no?

Before Chu Feng could say anything, that Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Son, Song Yunfei, spoke out against Ren Xiaoyao.

He was actually speaking for Chu Feng. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Brother Song, I was merely joking around too. It’s nothing serious.”

After Song Yunxi spoke, Ren Xiaoyao immediately started smiling apologetically. It would appear that he was extremely afraid of Song Yunxi.

“Brother Chu Feng, in that case, are you willing to play a round with us? It is merely for entertainment purposes, and thus losing will not matter. You won’t have to worry about losing face either.”

Ren Xiaoyao looked at Chu Feng again. Merely, his words were still thorny, and contained a trace of mockery, ridicule and insult.

“Chu Feng, it should be the first time that you’ve met him, no? Why is he so against you?” Her Lady Queen asked.

She was puzzled, and also slightly angry.

It was clearly the first time that they had met, and there were clearly no grievances between them. Thus, Her Lady Queen was unable to understand why Ren Xiaoyao would deliberately make things difficult for Chu Feng right after meeting him.

“I believe this is what is called femme fatale. He must’ve heard about the thing between Xia Yun’er and me, and it just so happened that he was interested in Xia Yun’er.”

“Furthermore, my cultivation is inferior to his own. Thus, he does not place me in his eyes. As such, he would automatically want to crush me before Xia Yun’er so as to demonstrate how much more powerful he is. It is much like how Han Yu was,” Chu Feng said.

“I have underestimated that girl Xia Yun’er’s charm. Since that’s the case, Chu Feng, you should play with him and properly teach this guy who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth a lesson,” Her Lady Queen said in an aggrieved manner.

She naturally wished for Chu Feng to teach Ren Xiaoyao a lesson. She wanted him to suffer the same fate as Han Yu.

The reason for that was because Her Lady Queen refused to allow anyone to look down on or humiliate Chu Feng.

At that moment, everyone present turned their eyes to Chu Feng. They were all waiting for Chu Feng’s answer.

“Since it’s a game, there’s no harm in participating,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well. In that case, brother Chu Feng, let us play this game.”

As Ren Xiaoyao spoke, he stood to one corner of the table and picked up one of the treasures.

Chu Feng walked over to the corner across from Ren Xiaoyao and also picked up a treasure.

“We’re missing two. Is anyone else willing to participate in the game?” Ren Xiaoyao looked to the crowd with a jokingly ridiculing gaze.

At that moment, the crowd started smiling in silence. No one dared to step forward.

From the reaction of the crowd, Chu Feng was able to tell that Ren Xiaoyao must’ve won against many of the people present. As such, no one was willing to play with him.

“It’s merely a game, look at you all,” Ren Xiaoyao’s jokingly ridiculing gaze had turned to one of actual ridicule. However, he did not force the others. Instead, he said to Chu Feng, “Brother Chu Feng, it would appear that it will be only you and I.”

“Let me explain the rules to you first. By shaking this Seven-colored Goblet of mine, it will give form to Seven-colored Pearls. When you stop shaking it, the Seven-colored Pearls will roll out of the Seven-colored Goblet.”

“The amount of Seven-colored Pearls will be different every time. Let us compare who will be able to create more Seven-colored Pearls. The one with more Seven-colored Pearls will be the victor,” Ren Xiaoyao said to Chu Feng.

‘And here I thought what sort of game it might be, turns out that it’s just shaking dice,’ Chu Feng thought to himself. At the same time, he also felt a bit speechless.

Shaking dice was a very common form of gambling known by many people in the world of ordinary people. It was also a very simple and cruel method of gambling.

For ordinary people, they would rely on luck. For experts, they would rely on their skill and techniques.

Chu Feng had never expected the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, this place with a great amount of martial cultivation experts, to also have this sort of thing. Furthermore, judging from it, it had become a very common game.

Even though there were essential differences, the method of playing with the Seven-colored Goblet was indeed very similar to the game Chu Feng knew in his childhood, the dice shaking.

When Chu Feng was young, he’d had no idea how to play the game, and was merely relying on luck.

However, after Chu Feng became a world spiritist, he became a master of multiple things. Among them was dice shaking. It could be said that Chu Feng became an expert that relied on techniques later on.

Even though Chu Feng had never played dice against others, he had still grasped the technique.

“Might it be possible for me to try it out first?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course,” Ren Xiaoyao waved his arm in a very magnanimous manner.

Chu Feng did not hesitate. He immediately started shaking the Seven-colored Goblet in his hand. Upon doing so, he began to hear sounds of collisions from the Seven-colored Goblet.

Originally, the sounds were collisions of gaseous substances. Then, it became actual substance. Chu Feng knew that the Seven-colored Goblet should be producing the so-called Seven-colored Pearls.

When Chu Feng stopped shaking his Seven-colored Goblet, three fingernail-sized pearls shining with seven different colors rolled out from the bottom of the Seven-colored Goblet.

Those pearls only lasted for a short moment before turning into gases that dissipated into the air.

“Chu Feng, how was it?” Her Lady Queen immediately asked.

“This Seven-colored Goblet is indeed a treasure. I am unable to see through it using world spirit techniques. I am also unable to sense anything with martial techniques.”

“However, if I do not use my spirit power and martial power and focus solely on the feeling in my hand, then I am able to deduce how many pearls have formed inside the Seven-colored Goblet. Merely... I would have to grasp a certain sort of pattern pertaining to the Seven-colored Goblet,” Chu Feng said to Her Lady Queen.

“In that case, how much certainty do you possess?” Her Lady Queen asked. Although this was merely a game, she still naturally wished for Chu Feng to win.

“It’s hard to say. If the rules are similar to that of ordinary dice shaking, it means that one will not get more Seven-colored Pearls by shaking for a longer period of time.”

“If one wanted to shake out more Seven-colored Pearls, one would have to grasp the pattern. I will need multiple attempts at it in order to figure out whether or not I will be able to grasp the pattern,’ Chu Feng said to Her Lady Queen.

“If there’s a pattern to it, then that Ren Xiaoyao must’ve already grasped the pattern. Do you still wish to continue playing this game with him?” Her Lady Queen asked.

She was worried that Chu Feng would lose. After all, he didn’t have any certainty in being able to win against Ren Xiaoyao, whereas Ren Xiaoyao was absolutely certain that he would be able to win against Chu Feng.

“Once you’ve started something, there’s no going back. Since I’ve already agreed to it, I cannot cower now. I can only give it a try,” Chu Feng said to Her Lady Queen.

“Brother Chu Feng, can we start now?” At that moment, Ren Xiaoyao started to urge Chu Feng maliciously.

“Of course,” Chu Feng answered.

“If that’s the case, let us begin. However, I don’t think it would be fun for us to just play the game as it is. I’ve heard that when you were playing chess against Han Yu and the others, you were each betting with one another. How about the two of us also put forth a bet?” Ren Xiaoyao looked to Chu Feng and smiled maliciously.

Hearing those words, the expressions of many people present changed.

Although they had also attempted the Seven-colored Goblets before, they were purely doing it for fun. There had never been any sort of bet in their games.

Yet, when Ren Xiaoyao wished to play against Chu Feng, he actually put forth a bet. This was clearly bullying Chu Feng.

Although they were already able to tell that Ren Xiaoyao was deliberately planning to bully Chu Feng, no one said anything.

Only Jian Wuqing swept a gaze of contempt at Ren Xiaoyao.

It could be seen that he deeply detested someone like Ren Xiaoyao.

When even the bystanders were able to tell, how would Chu Feng not be able to tell what Ren Xiaoyao had in mind? Actually, Chu Feng knew that Ren Xiaoyao had not come at him with good intentions from the very start.

Thus, Chu Feng reacted very calmly.

“How do you wish to gamble?” Chu Feng asked.

“Anything casual would be fine,” Ren Xiaoyao took out a silver gem. It was a treasure, a treasure that could be used in weaponry refinement.

Chu Feng was confident and at ease. He immediately took out a black gem from his Cosmos Sack. It was also a weaponry refinement treasure.

However, everyone was able to tell that, in terms of quality and value, Chu Feng’s black gem was a cut above Ren Xiaoyao’s silver gem.

Seeing how Chu Feng actually took out that black gem without the slightest hesitation, Ren Xiaoyao’s expression changed. He was surprised.

Although that black gem could not be considered an invaluable treasure, it was still something of considerable value. With how easily Chu Feng took it out, it illustrated how abundant Chu Feng was in wealth.

However, soon, a smile of his plot succeeding emerged in his eyes. Ren Xiaoyao said, “Let’s begin.”

After he finished saying those words, Ren Xiaoyao began to shake the Seven-colored Goblet in his hand. Chu Feng did not hesitate either. He too began to shake his Seven-colored Goblet.

“Paa~~~”

After a short moment, Ren Xiaoyao’s Seven-colored Goblet landed on the table.

“Paa~~~”

Immediately afterward, Chu Feng’s Seven-colored Goblet also landed on the table.

Although Chu Feng was slightly slower, Chu Feng’s hand-shaking motion while shaking the Seven-colored Goblet and the time he shook it for were all the same as Ren Xiaoyao’s.

“That Chu Feng is truly smart.”

At that moment, many people began to praise Chu Feng in their hearts.

Chu Feng had copied Ren Xiaoyao and used the same method to shake the Seven-colored Goblet. Furthermore, he also shook it for an identical time and slammed it onto the table in the same manner.

With this being the case, there would only be one possibility. That is, regardless of how many Seven-colored Pearls Ren Xiaoyao might be able to shake out, Chu Feng would be able to shake out an equal amount.

Although Chu Feng would not be able to win like this, he would, at the very least, not lose.

Seemingly understanding what Chu Feng and the others were thinking, the corners of Ren Xiaoyao’s mouth lifted into a cold sneer.

“Woosh~~~”

Afterwards, Ren Xiaoyao lifted up the Seven-colored Goblet in his hand.

At the same time, Chu Feng also lifted his Seven-colored Goblet.

At that moment, the gazes of everyone present were focused on the table.

“This...”

However, upon seeing the Seven-colored Pearls on the table, the expressions of the crowd all changed.

The reason for that was because the amount of Seven-colored Pearls the two contenders were able to produce were different. Chu Feng managed to produce six pearls, whereas Ren Xiaoyao produced eight pearls.

They were using the same method, the same technique and the same timing. Yet, the results were different.

This could only mean one thing: the techniques that Ren Xiaoyao had grasped were far superior to what the crowd had imagined.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’ve lost. I’ll be accepting that treasure of yours,” Ren Xiaoyao put Chu Feng’s black gem away with a beaming and slightly ridiculing smile on his face.

As for Chu Feng, there was no trace of anger or unwillingness on his face. On the contrary, he had a faint smile on his face.

Then, Chu Feng’s hand streaked across his Cosmos Sack. “Paa~~~” A glimmering palm-sized plant landed on the table.

It was also a treasure, a treasure for medicine conconcting. It was even more valuable than that black gem.

“Again,” Chu Feng said.
