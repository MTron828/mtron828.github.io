Chapter 4276 - Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound

“Oh no!!!”

“That vortex is about to suck the Ancient Compliance Castle into it!”

Seeing the Ancient Compliance Castle moving toward the vortex, Grandmaster Tang Chen and Celestial Fairy Muzhi immediately thought the Ancient Compliance Castle was about to be sucked into the vortex.

At practically the same time, the two of them rushed forth. Using their abilities, they tried to pull back the Ancient Compliance Castle.

But, to their helplessness... even though they were joining hands, they were unable to move he Ancient Compliance Castle in the slightest.

The two of them were simply unable to stop or even slow down the Ancient Compliance Castle. Even though they were joining hands, the speed at which the Ancient Compliance Castle was approaching the vortex did not decrease in the slightest.

Seeing this, Grandmaster Tang Chen and Celestial Fairy Muzhi became even more panicky.

At this moment, they realized the disparity between their strength.

Even though it was the two of them, there still exist an enormous difference between their power and that of the vortex.

“Old thing, why aren’t you coming to help us?”

In a panic, Grandmaster Tang Chen shouted at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

After all, Chu Feng was inside the Ancient Compliance Castle. As for Chu Feng, he’s not the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple.

Even Celestial Fairy Muzhi was so worried about Chu Feng’s safety. Yet, Ox-nosed Old Daoist was just standing there like he was watching a show.

This made Grandmaster Tang Chen slightly furious.

“What are the two of you doing? Come on down.”

Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not only not planning to help, he even told Grandmaster Tang Chen and Celestial Fairy Muzhi to stop.

“What are we doing?!”

“We’re naturally trying to save Chu Feng! What nonsense are you spouting?!”

“Old thing, this is no time to act crazy! Can you not see how dangerous that vortex is?!”

Grandmaster Tang Chen began to fume with rage between gritted teeth. He shouted angrily at Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

However, right at this moment, Old Man Compliance’s voice sounded from the Ancient Compliance Castle.

“Everyone, please don’t worry. This old man is bringing Chu Feng to do something. We will soon return.”

Hearing that voice, the crowd all came to a sudden and shocking realization.

“This... what is this situation?!”

“Could it be that vortex is caused by Old Man Compliance?!”

Celestial Fairy Muzhi watched as the Ancient Compliance Castle entered the vortex. Shock filled her eyes.

Even Grandmaster Tang Chen was completely stupefied.

“That’s a question? It’s obviously done by him,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Heavens, it really was done by Old Man Compliance?!”

“Old Man Compliance actually possesses such power?”

“We’ve underestimated him. He’s actually such a powerful existence.”

Even though the crowd were already guessing this possibility, it was confirmed by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

To the crowd, this was truly a shocking news.

Evidently, they didn’t know about Old Man Compliance enough before. Old Man Compliance’s strength had reached an unimaginably powerful level.

He was a well-concealed expert.

“Old thing, you already knew that was caused by that old thing Compliance?”

Grandmaster Tang Chen descended from the sky and asked Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Of course. Besides him, who else here could possibly accomplish such a thing? After all, he’s the person who inherited the Ancient Compliance Castle,” said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“You’ve realized that old thing Compliance has been concealing his strength?” asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“He had never bothered to conceal his strength. It’s just that he had never revealed it fully,” said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“This...” Grandmaster Tang Chen came to a sudden realization. It seemed like his understanding of Old Man Compliance was simply too shallow.

It was not only him. Truth is, besides the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, practically no one else in the Holy Light Galaxy discovered Old Man Compliance to be such a terrifying existence.

Before the crowd’s astonished eyes, Ancient Compliance Castle completely disappeared into the gigantic vortex.

“So it’s actually that Old Man Compliance.”

“It would appear that the expert that was concealing his strength was him,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“No, it’s not him,” said Lady Gusu.

“Lady Gusu, it’s not that old man?” Fumo Xin’er was surprised.

“Indeed, it’s not him. That person’s aura is still here. This meant that person didn’t leave this place yet,” said Lady Gusu.

“Ah? Wouldn’t that mean that there’s another expert beside that Old Man Compliance?”

“Is it the master of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain, that person who gave the inheritance to Chu Feng?” asked Fumo Xin’er.

“Say, Xin’er, how are you this slow-witted?”

“Couldn’t you tell that there’s simply no master to the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain?”

“Everything was done by that hidden expert.”

“Furthermore, I am certain that person is a modern era cultivator and not someone from the Ancient Era,” said Lady Gusu.

“A cultivator from the modern era?”

“You mean to say that someone had already grasped the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain but did not take away the inheritance so that they could deliberately set up this arrangement?”

“What is that person’s purpose in doing all this?”

Shock filled Fumo Xin’er’s face. All of this had surpassed her expectations.

“It would appear that we’ve been underestimating this Holy Light Galaxy.”

“While the ruler of this Holy Light Galaxy, the Holy Light Clan, is not much, there’s quite a lot of hidden experts in this Holy Light Galaxy,” said Fumo Shaoyu with a smile.

“Young master, could they be our enemies?” asked Fumo Xin’er worriedly.

She felt that a place as desolate as the Holy Light Galaxy couldn’t possibly have such powerful experts. Thus, she felt that those experts must be from other galaxies.

She doesn’t know what purpose those experts might have in being in the Holy Light Galaxy. But, she does not wish for their target to be them.

“Most likely not.”

“I’ve always felt like their target is Chu Feng instead,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“Chu Feng?”

Hearing those words, the worried look on Fumo Xin’er’s face did not decrease. Instead, it increased.

If those hidden experts’ target was them, they were at least able to fight them.

After all, both Lady Gusu and her young master were extremely powerful.

But, that was not the case for Chu Feng.

While Chu Feng’s talent was undoubtedly powerful, the desolate Holy Light Galaxy lacked powerful cultivation resources. Because of that, the speed at which Chu Feng progressed was relatively slow. Compared to the experts in the vast martial cultivation world, he’s simply too weak.

If that person that not even Lady Gusu was confident in defeating was aiming for Chu Feng, it would be truly dangerous for Chu Feng.

“Young master, what should we do now?” asked Fumo Xin’er. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s go find Chu Feng first.”

As Fumo Shaoyu spoke, he began to fly toward the vortex.

Seeing that, Lady Gusu grabbed Fumo Xin’er and flew after Fumo Shaoyu.

That vortex was very powerful. Even with Fumo Xin’er’s cultivation, she was unable to charge into the vortex on her own.

Only with the help from Lady Gusu was she able to enter the vortex.

......

Passing through the enormous spirit formation gate, the Ancient Compliance Castle arrived above the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.

Chu Feng felt a great amount of emotions upon his return to the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.

Back then, he came here for the sake of being ranked among the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

At that time, his cultivation was rather weak. He was simply unable to defeat Linghu Hongfei on his own. In the end, he had relied on Yu Sha.

It was Yu Sha who managed to tie with Linghu Hongfei and won Chu Feng the opportunity to enjoy the Ancestral Martial Decastars’ first ranker place alongside Longhu Hongfei.

Truth is, judging from the time, it has not been a long time since then.

But, the current Chu Feng was completely incomparable to then.

Chu Feng had leaped out of the Ancestral Martial Starfield now. The geniuses of the Ancestral Martial Starfield were no longer able to be on par with Chu Feng.

Likely, only the geniuses of the younger generation from the Upper Starfields were able to match him now.

After all, even Lu Jie, the person deemed to be the Holy Light Galaxy’s strongest world spiritist of the younger generation was defeated by Chu Feng.

“Exactly what does that existence want me to do?”

“The answer should be disclosed soon.”

“Come, let me witness your true colors.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng flew down and straight into the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.

Entering the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was not an easy task.

But, the current Chu Feng was someone with an Utmost Exalted level cultivation and rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation.

To him, the things here were simply no difficulty.

The only threat to Chu Feng was that mysterious existence.
