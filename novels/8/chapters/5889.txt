Chapter 5890: The Strongest Title, Monstrous Saint Human Emperor

“Is your Three Saints Monstrous Clan made out of two different clans?” Chu Feng asked.

After what he had seen thus far, he was getting a feeling that the Three Saints Monstrous Clan was more formidable than he had thought, so he wanted to gain a deeper understanding of it. That might prove to be useful when entering the sacred mountain.

“We were an alliance comprising 89 monstrous beast clans back in the Ancient Era, but we became collectively known as the Three Saints Monstrous Clan. Our name comes from the three Monstrous Saints who appeared in our clan at the same time,” Sansheng Qiutian proudly replied.

“I see. What is a Monstrous Saint?” Chu Feng asked.

“What? You don’t know what a Monstrous Saint is?” Sansheng Qiutian was stunned.

“Our present-era cultivators only know bits and pieces about the Ancient Era from the information we dig up from ancient remnants, so our knowledge is severely lacking. Why don’t you enlighten me?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s true. You wouldn’t be a present-era cultivator if you knew everything. Let me broaden your horizons then. The world of cultivation reached a peak in the Ancient Era, with many experts emerging from the humans and monstrous beast clans. The strongest monstrous beasts are known as saints, whereas the strongest humans are dubbed as emperors.

“Strength was of absolute importance for one to be dubbed as a saint or an emperor. They have to stand at the peak of the world of cultivation, towering over everyone else. Aside from that, they had to accomplish something huge too so that the entire world knew about them.

“It was no easy feat to be titled a saint. There are many powerful monstrous clans with a long lineage that failed to produce even a single Monstrous Saint over the generations. Yet, our Three Saints Monstrous Clan had three Monstrous Saints at the same time. Do you know just how formidable a feat that is?” Sansheng Qiutian asked.

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded. “The Three Saints Monstrous Clan must have been very powerful at its peak.”

“Very powerful is an understatement. We were one of the top ten monstrous beast clans in the Ancient Era, but you have to know this top ten includes the Dragon Clans, the Phoenix Clans, the Qilin Clans, and powerful monstrous beasts clans that have inherited divine bloodlines. This top ten carries a lot of weight,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“I see.” Chu Feng nodded.

“Do you know how formidable our Three Saints Monstrous Clan is now?”

“It’s stronger than I expected. Even if you see yourselves as one entity, it is still a clan comprising many monstrous beast clans, but why are there only two left?”

“I’m not sure about that either. According to our predecessors, our clansmen lost some of their memories after the Ancient Era. What we know is based on records from the Ancient Era, which state that our Three Saints Monstrous Clan consists of 89 monstrous beast clans,” Sansheng Qiutian replied.

“So you don’t know what happened in the later years of the Ancient Era too? Are there no records whatsoever?” Chu Feng asked.

“None at all.” Sansheng Qiutian shook his head. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zi Ling and Chu Feng fell into deep thoughts.

“Chu Feng, is it convenient for me to have a chat with Miss Zi Ling? Don’t worry, I won’t take advantage of her. I, Sansheng Qiutian, am a gentleman, after all,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“Go ahead,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re so generous.” Sansheng Qiutian turned to Zi Ling and asked, “Miss Zi Ling, do you have sisters in your family whom you can introduce to me?”

“You want me to introduce you to a partner?” Zi Ling asked.

“Yes yes! Miss Zi Ling is smart to get it straight at once,” Sansheng Qiutian replied with a grin.

“You should look for Chu Feng instead. He knows way more women than me,” Zi Ling scoffed.

“You should have said so earlier!” Sansheng Qiutian turned to Chu Feng. He didn’t say a word, but the way he rubbed his hands together and his gleaming eyes said it all.

Sansheng Xingyu looked at Chu Feng with curious eyes too.

“...” Chu Feng was rendered speechless. “Zi Ling is uttering nonsense. How would I know so many ladies?”

“Really? How many women are you close with? Let me take a quick count...” Zi Ling stretched her hand forth and slowly unfurled her fingers one by one. In the end, she gave up and snorted, “Forget it, I shan’t count anymore.”

“Why did you stop?” Sansheng Qiutian was perplexed.

Even Sansheng Xingyu looked at Zi Ling too.

“It’s too many to count,” Zi Ling replied.

“Woah!” Sansheng Qiutian looked at Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you’re being too much? Our fathers are close friends who have braved death together, and Elder Chu Xuanyuan is at least half a master of mine too. With our ties, the least you can do is introduce someone to me. Brother, I like human women. I’m begging you here. Why don’t you introduce one or two women who don't catch your fancy to me?”

“They are just my friends, but if you’re sincere about it, I can introduce someone to you. However, such things require mutual feelings. Don’t blame me if it doesn’t work out,” Chu Feng said.

“I won’t blame you. It’ll work out. I, Sansheng Qiutian, am the most talented prodigy ever in the history of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan. I doubt anyone will turn me down,” Sansheng Qiutian said proudly.

“You’re going overboard with your bragging. Sansheng Xingyu is right here,” Chu Feng said.

Sansheng Xingyu didn’t say a word. She couldn’t be bothered to argue about this.

“You shouldn’t look at things from the surface. I’m not saying that Sansheng Xingyu isn’t good enough, but I, Sansheng Qiutian, am simply too outstanding. Chu Feng, you mustn’t look down on me. Back then, my father defeated your father in the sacred mountain. Today, I’ll do the same as well,” Sansheng Qiutian boasted.

Chu Feng and Zi Ling were taken aback.

“My father...”

“My master...”

“Lost to your father?” Chu Feng and Zi Ling voiced their doubts at the same time.

“You didn’t know? Well, I guess there’s no reason for your father to talk about his dark history,” Sansheng Qiutiain said.

“Our fathers crossed blows?” Chu Feng asked.

“They didn’t, but the two of them often ventured into the sacred mountain together to decipher formations. They’d usually cooperate, but there is one formation that allows people to compete against each other, and there would be a record left behind. My father was one step faster than yours,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“I see.” Zi Ling breathed a sigh of relief.

However, Chu Feng asked, “Which formation is it? Can we enter?”

“It won’t be easy to access that formation. It’ll only be triggered under specific circumstances,” Sansheng Qiutian said.
