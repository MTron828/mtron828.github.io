Chapter 3436 - Chu Feng’s Fiancee

The people that suddenly appeared caught everyone’s attention. Especially Chu Feng, who immediately turned around.

Upon turning to look, Chu Feng couldn’t help but frown slightly and sigh in his heart, ‘This is truly what it means to encounter precisely what one doesn’t wish to encounter.’

It turned out that the people that came were the people that Chu Feng did not wish to see the most, people from the Gong Heavenly Clan.

Furthermore, there were a lot of them.

Apart from the people of the younger generation that he had encountered at the gate of the teleportation formation, there were also some older people. Of course, that Gong Mingyue who had a wedding engagement with him was also present. They were all led by the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Gong Chende. The person who had spoken earlier was also Gong Chende.

However, it should be mentioned that Gong Qing was not present.

Likely, Gong Qing was still by the lakeside.

Although Gong Qing was not present, all of the Gong Heavenly Clansmen present were focused on Chu Feng.

The gazes that they looked to Chu Feng with were rather complicated.

For the great majority of the Gong Heavenly Clansmen, they were looking at Chu Feng with skepticism. Some among them even possessed hostility. This was especially true for the men. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The insufferably arrogant Gong Mingyue was also staring at Chu Feng. She began to size him up. Complicated emotions were flowing through her beautiful eyes.

That said, there was also a well-intended gaze. It was from the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. At that moment, the number one individual of the Gong Heavenly Clan was looking at Chu Feng with a very passionate gaze. A single word could be seen all over him -- excitement.

“Young friend, I’ve heard that... you’re Chu Xuanyuan’s son?”

The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief arrived before Chu Feng, his gaze becoming even more passionate. At the same time, his behavior had even become tense.

Truth be told, Chu Feng really did not wish to admit it.

However, as things had reached this stage, he had no choice but to admit to it.

“Senior, my father is indeed Chu Xuanyuan,” Chu Feng replied with a clasped fist.

“Young friend, truly never would I have imagined that you were actually still alive.”

“This old man is truly ashamed to not have recognized you when I met you earlier, even though you resembled Xuanyuan so much.”

The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief grabbed Chu Feng’s shoulders. His hands were shivering. He was so excited that it was like he had found his long-lost grandson.

“Why is the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief acting so excited upon seeing Chu Feng?”

“I have no idea. They shouldn’t know one another. I’ve also never heard of the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief having any sort of relationship with Chu Xuanyuan.”

The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s excitement had completely baffled the bystanders.

“Perhaps everyone might not know about it. However, back then, I had made a marriage arrangement with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief,” The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said to the crowd with a smile on his face.

“What? A marriage arrangement?” The crowd’s expressions changed upon hearing those words. Then, they turned their eyes to Chu Feng and Gong Mingyue.

The crowd weren’t fools. They knew that the so-called marriage arrangement must have been made between Chu Feng and Gong Mingyue.

“Grandfather,” At that moment, Gong Mingyue arrived behind the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and pulled at his clothes.

Judging from her behavior, it seemed that Gong Mingyue did not wish for the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to announce the matter publicly.

However, the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief acted as if he did not notice her movements, and began to publicly announce what had happened back then.

However, according to the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, that marriage arrangement was clearly made as a joke.

After all, the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was not the only person that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had made a marriage arrangement with. Instead, he had made wedding arrangements with many other people.

However, the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief described what had happened back then in an extremely earnest manner. It was as if the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had only made a marriage arrangement with his Gong Heavenly Clan, that Chu Feng must officially marry his granddaughter.

“Heavens, never would I have imagined that there was such a wedding arrangement between the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Gong Heavenly Clan.”

“This Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief is quite bold and resolute. Back then, Chu Xuanyuan had offended the Starfield Master Realm, and now that the Chu Heavenly Clan has fallen to such a state, I had thought that no one would try to walk too close to the Chu Heavenly Clan anymore.”

“Even if there are relationships between them, they would’ve voided it at the first opportunity. Yet, the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief actually dared to admit to it. Furthermore, he was the one to publicly announce the wedding arrangement. It would appear... that he was determined to marry his granddaughter to Chu Feng.”

Hearing the story from the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the crowd all felt rather surprised.

“Senior, I have never heard about this matter from my Lord Clan Chief,” Chu Feng said.

“Never heard of it? Chu Feng, what are you trying to imply? Could it be that you don’t want to take our young miss as your wife?”

Once Chu Feng said those words, he was immediately met with displeased rebukes from the Gong Heavenly Clansmen.

Even Gong Mingyue revealed a flabbergasted expression as she looked at Chu Feng.

Evidently, she had not expected Chu Feng to say that sort of thing.

In her entire life, it had only been her who rejected others, and never others rejecting her.

Thus, she was extremely confident in herself, and had very high requirements for her potential spouse.

As such, she naturally did not wish to fulfill the marriage arrangement with Chu Feng. She felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than a toad that could not match a swan like herself.

However, the toad in her eyes now actually revealed an attitude of indifference toward her. This greatly surprised her. Yet, at the same time, it made her feel extremely displeased.

“Impudent! Who allowed you all to shout at young friend Chu Feng?” Suddenly, a furious shout sounded from the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

The Gong Heavenly Clansmen immediately shut up. Although they felt very displeased, they could only glare at Chu Feng, and did not dare to say anything anymore.

“Young friend Chu Feng, your father... how is he now?” The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

Once he asked that question, all of the crowd present immediately perked up their ears with expressions of anticipation as they looked to Chu Feng.

Everyone wanted to know exactly how Chu Xuanyuan was doing.
