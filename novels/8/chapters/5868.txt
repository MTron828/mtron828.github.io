Chapter 5869: Grandson vs. Maternal Grandfather

Chapter 5869: Grandson vs. Maternal Grandfather

There were many immemorial treasures in the world, but Jie Tianran’s copper mirror had a special imprint on it. Treasures bearing this imprint had two unique traits.

One, they had to be tamed and could only be used once.

Two, they harnessed powers that were either overwhelmingly strong or unique.

Song Changsheng was able to reach his current level not just due to his talent but also his fortuitous encounters. He had found many remnants others had overlooked and benefited from them.

On two different occasions, in different remnants, he had encountered treasures bearing such an imprint. However, he failed to take it away with them because he couldn’t tame it.

The first time was in his younger years. The second time was not too long ago.

If he could still justify his first failure with his young age and lack of experience, the second failure symbolized the limits of his abilities. It made him realize that it took more than a high cultivation level to obtain such a treasure; one had to be very talented and intelligent too.

He doubted if the Ox-nosed Old Daoist could have tamed such imprinted treasures. The only ones who stood a chance, other than the powerful existences in the early years of the present era who pushed the world of cultivation to a formidable height, were Chu Feng and his father.

Even so, that was only a possibility. He knew how terrifyingly talented Chu Feng and his father were, but he wasn’t certain whether they had the ability to tame such imprinted treasures. After all, he had tried taming such a treasure himself and knew just how difficult it was.

The fact that Jie Tianran could tame such a treasure meant that he was incredibly talented. What he had revealed thus far might not necessarily be the limits of what he was capable of. At the very least, he was a force to be reckoned with.

...

As time passed, the imprint on the copper mirror started to fade. Chu Feng could tell that the copper mirror would lose its effect once the imprint faded.

“Lord Sectmaster, I need more time,” Chu Feng told the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster via the formation.

“How much longer do you need?” the sectmaster asked.

“I have to stay here till Jie Tianran’s treasure loses its effectiveness. At the current rate, I don’t think the treasure will last more than four hours. Lord Sectmaster, you don’t have to worry about me. Even if the formation fails, I have a way to return to the sect,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, I can extend the duration. You don’t have to worry about the formation. I know this is a rare opportunity for you, so give it your best,” the sectmaster replied.

Chu Feng had liaised with the sectmaster to allay her worry and assure her that he could protect himself even if the formation lost its effectiveness. He didn’t expect the sectmaster to be able to extend the formation’s duration.

Delighted, he replied, “I’ll be counting on you then, Lord Sectmaster.”

He put his full attention into deciphering the gates.

Two hours later, Chu Feng finally found the crucial runes amidst the ocean of runes, and he quickly arranged them in order. A powerful suction force suddenly gripped him and dragged him through the gates of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city.

Chu Feng hadn’t used his psyche and spirit power; he had only observed the gates from afar and arranged the runes in his mind. Yet, his consciousness was dragged into the main city as soon as he deciphered it in his mind.

He found himself in an empty, pitch-black realm, with only a humongous gate to be seen.

“Congratulations on reaching here, young friend. You’ll be undergoing a trial. If you clear the trial, there’s a chance you may receive our Ancestral Martial Sect Realm’s key,” a deep voice echoed.

The surrounding space shook as the humongous gate began to open. A beam of light shone through the cracks of the gate and fell on Chu Feng, blinding him. Nevertheless, he could sense tremendous energy from the gate.

The real trial was about to begin.

Creak!

Just then, the gate suddenly closed.

Chu Feng was confused.

Just then, the deep voice echoed once more, “Only one person can take the trial at a time. Whoever fails will have to re-enter this space.”

Chu Feng immediately turned around and saw another figure standing not too far away. It was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, Jie Tianran. His consciousness had been transported into this space too.

“Chu Feng, how did you get in here?” Jie Tianran had just arrived here and was shocked to see Chu Feng.

“Why can’t I be here?” Chu Feng retorted.

“This isn’t a place for someone like you. Get lost!”

Jie Tianran sent a gush of psyche reminiscent of a tsunami at Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng wasn’t intimidated. He retaliated by sending a gush of psyche, and his psyche was even stronger than Jie Tianran’s.

As only their consciousness had been transported here, they had neither their cultivation nor their spirit power. As a result, they were only able to battle with their psyche.

As soon as their psyches collided, Chu Feng’s psyche immediately suppressed Jie Tianran’s. The latter clenched his jaws and growled at Chu Feng, but it did nothing to change the outcome. With his psyche fully suppressed, it didn’t take long for his knees to shake.

At this rate, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master was going to kneel to Chu Feng!

But more important than that, if his psyche was devoured by Chu Feng’s, he would be driven out of this space and lose his chance at obtaining the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasure.

“That’s all you amount to, Jie Tianran,” Chu Feng sneered.

“Don’t get smug, you little bastard. You merely inherited Ranqing’s talent, but you should remember that Ranqing’s talent comes from me. You’re nothing at all before me!” Jie Tianran roared.

He was just about to kneel, but he suddenly shot back to his feet and released a burst of an even stronger psyche. In the blink of an eye, the tables were turned on Chu Feng.

The two psyches were so powerful that they distorted their surroundings.

“He has a secret hand! Was he waiting for me to get careless so that he could take me down in a single move? No, I can’t lose to him here!” Chu Feng frowned.

He clenched his jaws and focused his attention on channeling his psyche. His cultivation and spirit power weren’t a match for Jie Tianran's yet, so this was the only stage where he had a chance to defeat Jie Tianran.

If he couldn’t even defeat Jie Tianran here, what rights would he have to challenge the latter?

To put it bluntly, they were pitting their foundations as world spiritists against each other right now. If Chu Feng couldn’t beat Jie Tianran in terms of psyche, it was unlikely he would be able to beat the latter even if he caught up to him in the future.
