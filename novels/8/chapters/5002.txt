Chapter 5002: Meeting the Netherworld Envoy

“We won’t be able to interfere in his business, so let’s not pay it any heed for now,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

Her intention was to overlook whatever the Netherworld Sect was trying to achieve and prioritize saving Song Yun first. After all, they didn’t have the strength to interfere in the Netherworld Sect’s affairs anyway.

The Godwish Grandmother took out another talisman and crushed it, causing a surge of energy to ripple outward. It was a communication means intended to inform the Netherworld Envoy of the Godwish Grandmother’s visit. All they had to do right now was to wait on the spot.

Roughly four hours later…

“Is he here?”

Chu Feng suddenly raised his head to look toward the south.

“Hm?”

Doubt filled Chu Feng’s eyes.

“What’s wrong, Junior Chu Feng?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“I feel like someone is looking at us, but… It might just be my imagination.”

Chu Feng shook his head. He didn’t want to give out a conjecture he wasn’t certain about.

“Are those from the Netherworld Sect here? Why not show yourself?” Shengguang Baimei shouted loudly.

He was the kind of person who liked to maintain a brave front no matter how afraid he was of the other party. His insolent attitude induced a glare from the Godwish Grandmother, who didn’t want to turn the Netherworld Sect against her.

Fortunately, there was no response to his words.

So, they continued waiting.

However, Chu Feng still felt a stare on him from time to time, but the feeling would vanish the moment he turned to look in the direction. He thought that it was just his imagination at the start, but he soon became certain that someone was indeed staring at him.

He thought that it was likely that it was the Netherworld Envoy, but he couldn’t understand why the latter refused to show himself.

It was only on the sixth hour after the Godwish Grandmother sent out the signal that a massive tornado started approaching from the north. Despite the terrifying appearance of the disaster, it was actually induced by a single beast.

A humongous bat monstrous beast.

Its cultivation was at early Martial Exalted level, but it had a massive physique. Most notably, its wingspan stretched on for over thirty thousand meters. It was due to those wings that it was able to stir such a huge tornado.

“Is the Godwish Grandmother there?”

The bat monstrous beast didn’t recognize the Godwish Grandmother, but it knew that one of them was her.

“I am. May I know if your lord is there?”

The bat monstrous beast was nothing but a small fry to the Godwish Grandmother, but she knew that it had ties with the Netherworld Envoy, so she maintained a polite attitude when addressing it. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Climb onto my back.”

In contrast, the bat monstrous beast’s attitude was a little cold.

However, Chu Feng and the others didn’t think much of it. They heeded his instructions and climbed onto his back.

“Pardon me, but I have urgent matters that I need your lord’s help on. Could you point a direction out for us and I’ll head over first?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“Heh…”

Those words brought about a sneer from the bat monstrous beast.

Weng!

Rays of blue light suddenly shone from the bat monstrous beast. Upon closer examination, Chu Feng realized that each ray was a rune in itself. After the surfacing of the runes, the bat monstrous beast beat its wings once more, and it suddenly started moving at a breakneck speed.

Chu Feng and the others had traveled with the Godwish Grandmother thus far, so they could tell that the bat monstrous beast was actually moving at a speed faster than the Godwish Grandmother. It was particularly shocking because they could tell that the bat monstrous beast was only at early Martial Exalted level.

They knew that it must be the doing of the blue runes. It must be some kind of special formation that granted the bat monstrous beast speed far beyond its own means.

“It’s still there?”

Along the way, Chu Feng would still turn around from time to time. He could still feel the gaze persistently lingering on him even though they were traveling at such great speed. That suggested that the owner of the gaze was a formidable expert too.

Soon, under the bat monstrous beast’s lead, Chu Feng arrived at a humongous formation that rose from the earth to heaven, connecting with the barrier that sealed off the Ordinary Realm. As the formation was black in color, the energy pulsations from it resembled dark clouds, bringing about a stifling atmosphere.

A man dressed in a red robe and white veil was currently channeling the formation. The words ‘Netherworld Envoy’ were embroidered in black on his red robe, leaving no room to misinterpret his identity.

“Milord, I’ve brought over the people you have ordered me to fetch.”

As the bat monstrous beast approached the Netherworld Envoy, he morphed into a human, dropped to his knees, and bowed deeply to the latter. That was a huge difference from how he treated Chu Feng and the others.

But again, that was only to be expected, The Netherworld Envoy hadn’t revealed his true prowess yet, but one could already feel the incredible presence he commanded. Anyone looking at him could easily tell that he was a top-notch expert.

The Netherworld Envoy turned around, but they were unable to see his appearance due to his veil. However, his hands were ghastly pale and his fingernails were exceptionally long, which made him appear more like a zombie than a human.

The Netherworld Envoy walked his hand, and the bat monstrous beast quickly took its leave.

“Milord, please save Yun’er!”

The Godwish Grandmother carried Yun’er forward and kneeled onto the ground.

“It looks like Song Yun is in a bad condition,” the Netherworld Envoy spoke with an eerie, hoarse voice.

“Milord, are you able to save Yun’er?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“Given her condition, the only way to save her is to plant another one in her. However, very few people are able to withstand two of them at once, and she might lose her life if she fails to hold on. I’ll leave the decision up to you,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

“Milord, is there any other solution?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“This is the only way out. You need to quickly make your decision. Song Yun’s condition is deteriorating with each passing moment. The longer you wait, the lower the chances of success,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

“… I’ll accept your offer, milord. Please save my Yun’er,” the Godwish Grandmother quickly made her decision.

“Alright. I’ll be starting the procedure now.”

The Netherworld Envoy took out a being from his robe. The moment the being appeared, Chu Feng and the others felt chills running through their bodies.
