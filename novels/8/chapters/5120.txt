Chapter 5120: I’m Here to Help

There were words written on the tombstone, but Chu Feng frowned at the sight. The content basically stated that this was the domain of an existence whose origins could be traced back to the Ancient Era, and those who entered the spirit formation gate would obtain unprecedented honor. The honor was to become the existence’s subordinate.

There were two types of subordinates.

One was a simple servant and the other was to serve as his guard.

There was a difference between the two. Servants were able to preserve their souls, but they had to cultivate a unique plant known as the Demonsoul Grass and tribute a fixed amount of it in the Soultribute Hall every day.

Otherwise, a force would shroud the entire land, punishing every single person here.

As for those who chose to serve as guards, they had to offer their souls up to that existence. In exchange for their loyalty, they would obtain greater power. However, there was no further elaboration as to what those who had chosen to become guards would do.

The tombstone simply stated that those who wished to become guards only had to step into the spirit formation gate beneath the tombstone.

Those who refused to become guards would naturally become servants, which meant that Lord Yuwei, Lord Bai, and everyone else in the city had chosen to become servants.

“Does it mean that everyone in the city has chosen to become servants?” Chu Feng asked for clarification.

“Yes, young master. Even though we’re trapped here, we still wish to retain our freedom of will. Of course, we’re also praying for the slim hope that someone would eventually lead us out of this place. If we offer our souls away, there’s no way we’ll be able to escape anymore,” Lord Bai said.

“All you have to do here is to plant the Demonsoul Grass? Are there any benefits to doing so?’ Chu Feng asked.

“Benefits? How could there be any benefits? We’re mere servants!” Lord Bai replied.

“But what’s with the cultivation of those living here? Aren’t they from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm? How is it possible that some of them have already reached Martial Exalted level?” Chu Feng asked.

“No no no, you’re misunderstanding something. The Darknight Sacred River doesn’t just exist in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm; it appears in the other galaxies too. Many of the people you see in the city are from other galaxies. Cultivators from our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm only make up a minority of them.

“It’s just that the other exits appeared to have closed with time, leaving just the one from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. However, as the river only opens for a short period of time, we don’t really get many newcomers anymore. The last time it opened was when Lord Yuwei came in. She was the only one in her group,” Lord Bai explained.

“I see.”

Chu Feng finally understood the reason behind the huge disparity in cultivation among those living here. It turned out that the Darknight Sacred River was linked to the other galaxies too. It was just that the entrances from the other galaxies closed at some point in time.

“Who is the master of this place? Have you seen him before?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’m afraid not,” Lord Bai replied. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What about the guards who have given away their souls? Where did they go?” Chu Feng asked.

“They went to another area. The two areas are divided by a barrier, but every decade, the barrier would deactivate. The guards would stomp into our area to demand huge quantities of Demonsoul Grass. They would take 10,000 beautiful young women and 20,000 young men away with them.”

Fury and killing intent flared in Lord Bai’s eyes as he spoke.

“10,000 beautiful women and 20,000 young men?”

It was clear as day that those guards weren’t up to anything good abducting those people, but Chu Feng wanted to confirm his guess, so he asked, “Why do they abduct them?”

“I don’t know, but those who went to the other area never came back. I reckon that something bad has happened to them,” Lord Bai said with a deep sigh.

“What if you refuse to accede to the guards’ demands?” Chu Feng asked.

“Refuse? How can we refuse? Those guards have gained great power by offering their souls to the master of this place! That’s why we have traitors who would convert into guards every year! There’s no way we could put up a fight against those guards,” Lord Bai exclaimed.

“Do you know what’s the cultivation of their strongest cultivator?” Chu Feng asked.

“There are many Martial Exalted level and Utmost Exalted level cultivators amongst them. The strongest one has already reached Half-God level,” Lord Bai replied.

“Do you know the exact cultivation rank?” Chu Feng asked.

“There’s a huge disparity in my cultivation and his. That bastard would exert his oppressive might to intimidate us each time we meet, but we’re unable to gauge his exact cultivation. According to Lord Yuwei though, he should be at rank two Half-God level,” Lord Bai replied.

“How strong is Lord Yuwei?”

Chu Feng guessed that Lord Yuwei’s cultivation should be lower than rank two Half-God level, or else those guards wouldn’t have been able to do as they pleased. At the same time, she was likely to be fairly strong in order to be able to discern the strongest enemy’s cultivation.

As for why Chu Feng was unable to sense Lord Yuwei’s cultivation earlier, it must be due to her carrying some sort of treasure that masked her aura. It wasn’t too surprising that Lord Yuwei would have something as valuable as that since she was on close terms with his grandmother.

“Lord Yuwei is a formidable person. Her cultivation was previously at rank nine Martial Exalted level, but not too long ago, she managed to make a breakthrough to rank one Half-God level. She was trying to reinforce her cultivation earlier on during her closed-door training.

“She said that she wouldn’t allow those guards to take away any of us anymore now that she has reached rank one Half-God level,” Lord Bai said.

“You’re saying that Lord Yuwei and the others have left to meet with those guards?” Chu Feng asked.

“Ah! No no no, I’m talking about the future,” Lord Bai quickly corrected himself.

However, his smile was so strained that Chu Feng could tell right away that he was lying.

“Lord Bai, tell me where Lord Yuwei is meeting with those guards,” Chu Feng said.

Those guards were no kind souls, and Lord Yuwei’s opposition toward them taking away their men and women would surely escalate into a conflict. While Lord Yuwei had managed to make a breakthrough to rank one Half-God level, she was still a rank off from matching the strongest guard. This put her in a disadvantageous position.

There was no way Chu Feng could turn a blind eye to this, especially when he had the strength to interfere in this matter.

“Ah, I suddenly remembered! The meeting is actually a few days later. Lord Yuwei and the others must be doing something else right now,” Lord Bai lied.

“I’ll just have to chase after them if you refuse to speak,” Chu Feng said.

“Haaa, you are really… Chu Feng, I’ll be honest with you. Lord Yuwei secretly sent me a voice transmission to stop you from learning about what they are going to do. I’d be letting Lord Yuwei down if you head there right now,” Lord Bai said.

“Elder, I’m here to help you out. Shouldn’t you know better than anyone else that Lord Yuwei is potentially in danger right now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course I do! That’s why I can’t let you go. What can a junior like you possibly do to help? Just listen to me,” Lord Bai insisted.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng revealed a smile. He released his oppressive might as a rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivator.

“You… you… you!!!”

Lord Bai was dumbstruck by Chu Feng’s cultivation.

“Lord Bai, don’t you think I’ll be able to offer some help now?” Chu Feng asked.
