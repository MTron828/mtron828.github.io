Chapter 3324 - Grasping Power

Liangqiu Chengfeng’s shout for Chu Feng to get back caught the attention of everyone present

At that moment, everyone subconsciously turned their eyes to Liangqiu Chengfeng. This included Chu Feng, who was before the grand defensive formation.

“Young friend Chu Feng, this old man had miscalculated. That defensive formation actually possesses two essential formation-breaching points. If those two points are not taken care of, it will be very difficult to breach it.”

“You must stop right now, or else you will end up suffering a backlash.”

Fearing that Chu Feng would not understand, Liangqiu Chengfeng explained why he shouted for Chu Feng to get back.

Chu Feng was not too nervous after hearing what Liangqiu Chengfeng said. However, the others present, those grand characters from the various powers, immediately revealed very worried expressions on their faces.

Liangqiu Chengfeng had miscalculated?

Chu Feng needed to immediately abort the breaching process?

Wouldn’t that mean that Chu Feng would end up failing in his attempt to breach the defensive formation?

Wouldn’t that mean that they would really have no way to obtain the treasure within that spirit formation?

However, at the moment when the crowd were all worried, Chu Feng said to Liangqiu Chengfeng, “Senior, please don’t worry. Junior has already prepared for this.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, his hand streaked across his Cosmos Sack. Then, an item appeared in his hand.

“That is?”

Seeing the item in Chu Feng’s hand, Liangqiu Chengfeng, who was originally worried for Chu Feng immediately revealed a change in his gaze. The worry that filled his eyes was replaced with an expression of pleasant surprise.

The reason for that was because what Chu Feng held in his hand was a piece of rock.

That rock greatly resembled the rock that Liangqiu Chengfeng had discovered at the spirit formation gate.

“Could it be... that is?”

When he saw the rock in Chu Feng’s hand, a thought came to Liangqiu Chengfeng’s mind. He felt that it was very likely that Chu Feng had also discovered a crucial object to breach the defensive formation at the spirit formation gate. As for that crucial object, it was that piece of rock.

While that thought came to Liangqiu Chengfeng’s mind, Chu Feng placed the rock into the recess.

“Buzz~~~”

In an instant, light started to shine brightly. A vast expanse of white filled the crowd’s field of view. They were unable to see anything.

They were only able to hear repeated explosive shattering sounds coming from Chu Feng’s direction.

The shattering sounds were explosively loud, and continued for a very long time.

The crowd all subconsciously felt that Chu Feng might’ve succeeded, and that defensive formation might have been destroyed by him.

They all wanted to rush past Chu Feng at the first moment, and be the first to obtain the treasure within the spirit formation.

However, even though that was what they wanted to do, they were powerless to do so.

It turned out that the vast expanse of whiteness was not merely a simple bright white light. That whiteness also possessed an extremely powerful restrictive ability. At that moment... all the people present had their movements restricted by it, and were unable to budge in the slightest.

There was only a single exception to the case. As for that person, he was Chu Feng.

Not only was Chu Feng not restricted, but the sight before his eyes was also not that vast expanse of whiteness.

That restrictive power did not restrict him, and the white light also did not cover his sight.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng was standing inside the formation core.

At that moment, Chu Feng was surrounded by flowing spirit power, extremely powerful spirit power on top of that. It was so powerful that it could obliterate every single one of the people present.

Furthermore, the spirit power was gathering toward Chu Feng, waiting to be utilized by him.

The reason for that was because of the two rocks that Chu Feng held in his hands.

Those two rocks were precisely the rocks Chu Feng had used to breach the defensive formation. However, those two rocks had changed enormously.

While their color remained the same, they had turned into energy, and had assimilated into Chu Feng’s palms.

In the end, the two energies had turned into two symbols, and imprinted onto Chu Feng’s palms.

The surrounding power was also under Chu Feng’s complete control.

If Chu Feng desired it, he could very well utilize the power of the spirit formation to obliterate everyone present, and hog all the treasures to himself.

However, Chu Feng did not do that. Instead, he activated the spirit formation and concealed the enormous power. After he did that, the power restricting the crowd’s movement also disappeared.

The white light that had blinded the crowd’s sight also disappeared alongside that restrictive power.

“Breached. Young friend Chu Feng, you’ve actually managed to accomplish it.”

“Young friend Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. If your grandfather and father were able to see this, they would definitely be proud of you.”

At that moment, the joyous crowd actually began to openly praise Chu Feng.

After they had personally witnessed the defensive formation disappearing and the treasure appearing before their eyes, they gained a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng. Even the anger that they felt toward him had subsequently disappeared.

That said, the crowd still rushed toward the treasure at the first opportunity, and began to use their respective sensing abilities to sense the power of that treasure.

“Young friend Chu Feng, never did I imagine that you’d also discover that there was a crucial item needed for the final formation inside your spirit formation gate. This old man had underestimated you.”

Liangqiu Chengfeng stood up. Supported by Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue, he arrived before Chu Feng.

He was still extremely weak, and looked like a person on the verge of death. However, he had a joyous smile on his face.

Even though he had already realized that Chu Feng possessed exceptional talent, he still managed to pleasantly surprise him.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you’ve failed in your formation breaching and ended up damaging the treasure. You will have to provide an explanation for that,” right at that moment, a voice filled with anger sounded from the direction of the treasure. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It was Song Boqiu. Song Boqiu was looking at Chu Feng with an angry expression.

“Senior, why do you say such a thing?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am unable to sense the slightest bit of martial comprehension from that treasure. You have ruined the treasure,” Song Boqiu said.

“Brother Song, ease your anger. It was difficult for young friend Chu Feng to do all this.”

“That’s right.”

After Song Boqiu finished saying those words, some of the grand characters that were sensing and comprehending the treasure with Song Boqiu began to dissuade him.

Comprehending the treasure at the same time as Song Boqiu, they’d managed to gain enormous profit in an extremely short period of time.

As such, they knew that Liangqiu Chengfeng had not deceived them, and that it was truly a rare cultivation resource. That treasure was so precious that it could lead to a bloody battle in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Yet, Song Boqiu actually said that he was unable to gain any martial comprehension from it? Wouldn’t he be simply spouting nonsense?

Song Boqiu was simply picking a quarrel and deliberately creating trouble for Chu Feng.

That was why those people tried to dissuade Song Boqiu.

After all, that cultivation resource was simply too precious. Even though they had planned to create trouble for Chu Feng in the beginning, they had changed their intention.

They felt that Chu Feng’s contribution was truly worthy of those cultivation resources that he had demanded from them.

“Shut up! This matter is unrelated to you all. If any of you dare to shoot your mouth off again, do not blame this old man for being impolite,” Song Boqiu looked at the people that attempted to dissuade him with a furious glare.

At that moment, those people that had attempted to dissuade him all lowered their heads, and said no more.

They understood that Song Boqiu was determined to take care of Chu Feng.

If they attempted to dissuade him again, they would also end up suffering his calamity. After all, Song Boqiu dared to even attack and injure Li Taiyi. Thus, how could he possibly be afraid of attacking them?

“Song Boqiu, this treasure is so exceptional, and simply something that this old man has never seen before. Even though it’s a cultivation resource that contains such an enormous amount of martial comprehension, you’re saying that you’re unable to gain any?”

“Does your conscience not feel pain for you to spout that sort of nonsense?” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke with a cold voice.

Earlier, he had been treating the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s injury the entire time, and was thus not the first one to arrive before the treasure. It was only after Song Boqiu decided to deliberately make things difficult for Chu Feng that he arrived before the treasure to check things out.

As for the result of his inspection, it made him certain that Song Boqiu was deliberately creating trouble for Chu Feng.
