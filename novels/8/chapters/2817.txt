Chapter 2817 - The Sacred Tree’s Unforeseen Event

“It was something that happened right after the Purple Sun Sacred Palace finished opening. As the twelve day limit arrived, all of us walked out of the Purple Sun Sacred Palace.”

“However, we had a special sort of habit. That is, we would always stay to witness the Purple Sun Sacred Palace closing its gates before leaving. Thus, there were quite a lot of people present that day.”

“That said, none of us would’ve ever expected an enormous hand to split through the void and emerge from the sky after the Purple Sun Sacred Palace closed its gates. That enormous hand actually forcibly uprooted the unshakeable Purple Sun Sacred Palace from the ocean.”

“The instant when the Purple Sun Sacred Palace was uprooted, a tsunami immediately started surging in all directions. The waves were so enormous that they even reached the sky itself.”

“Perhaps it was because of some sort of oppressive might, but those waves were extremely violent and powerful.”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief was present to forcibly block the incoming waves, I fear that over half of the people present back then would’ve died.”

“However, even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief could only look on helplessly as the Purple Sun Sacred Palace was taken away by that enormous hand,” Elder Ma Changchun said.

“So the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief was also present that day?!” Li Xiang became very spirited. It could be seen that he had not known that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was present.

That said, Li Xiang was also brimming with questions. He asked, “But, if the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief was present, why didn’t he stop that person? Why would he allow the Purple Sun Sacred Palace to be taken away before his eyes?”

“The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief is the strongest expert in our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. That is undisputable.”

“However, even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief is generally powerless before the Six Great Sacred Vestiges.”

“Yet, that enormous hand from the sky managed to forcibly uproot the Purple Sun Sacred Palace. It goes without saying how powerful that existence was.”

“The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief knew very well that he was no match for that existence. Thus, he would naturally not attack rashly. After all, if he were to do so, he would only court disaster for himself,” Elder Ma Changchun said.

“So that’s the case. I was foolish,” Li Xiang scratched his head awkwardly. He had come to a realization, and felt what Elder Ma Changchun said to be very reasonable.

To rashly fight when faced with an undefeatable opponent was indeed very irrational.

As the ruler of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would naturally not make such a rudimentary mistake.

“Senior, in that case, do you know who took away the Purple Sun Sacred Palace?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t. That person only revealed that enormous hand from the sky, and not his or her face.”

“In fact, we do not even know whether that person was a human. We merely determined that person to most likely be a human from the appearance of that hand.”

“Furthermore, this matter alarmed the people from the Starfield Master Realm. The Starfield Master Realm immediately dispatched people to investigate. However, in the end, they were unable to determine who took the Purple Sun Sacred Palace,” Ma Changchun said.

“The Starfield Master Realm is?” Chu Feng asked.

“Oh, I forgot to mention that to you. The Starfield Master Realm is the world where the ruler of our Starfield is located. They rule over countless Upper Realms. They control everything, like gods.”

“To put it rudely, even the ruler of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, has no authority to speak in the Starfield Master Realm,” Ma Changchun spoke softly.

“In that case, it would mean that the person who took the Purple Sun Sacred Palace was truly a powerful being,” Chu Feng was extremely curious as to exactly who it was that took away the Purple Sun Sacred Palace.

“Chu Feng, could the hand that took away the Purple Sun Sacred Palace be the same hand that ripped apart the sky in the Eastern Sea Region that day?” Her Lady Queen asked.

“Let me ask about it,” Chu Feng turned to ask Elder Ma Changchun.

However, from the description of the hand given by Elder Ma Changchun, Chu Feng discovered that the hand that took away the Purple Sun Sacred Palace seemed to be different from the hand that tore apart the sky in the Eastern Sea Region.

This most likely meant that the two individuals were not the same. If one wanted to find something identical regarding them, then one could only say that they were extremely frighteningly powerful existences.

They were beings like gods that were capable of dominating everything.

“Chu Feng, say, could it be caused by the Starfield Master Realm?” Her Lady Queen asked.

It could be seen that Her Lady Queen was even more curious about this matter than Chu Feng.

“It’s hard to tell. It’s not like there’s not such a possibility,” Chu Feng said in his mind.

“Senior, in that case, what sort of miraculous place is the Void Sacred Tree?” Chu Feng continued to ask.

The Void Sacred Tree was actually what Chu Feng wanted to know about the most. After all, the unforeseen event had occurred at the Void Sacred Tree. Chu Feng was very curious as to what that unforeseen event was.

“The Void Sacred Tree is a great tree growing within the void itself. It is enormous, and capable of covering an entire region. It is a truly spectacular tree.”

“The Void Sacred Tree contains an extremely dense amount of natural energies. Furthermore, it is great place for one to train and attempt a breakthrough.”

“Merely, there is a spirit formation around the Void Sacred Tree. That spirit formation will only disappear once every hundred years. When it disappears, one will be able to enter the Void Sacred Tree to train. However, after some time passes, that spirit formation will reemerge.”

“That spirit formation will emerge from the depths of the Void Sacred Tree and extend outward. As it extends, it will push out all of the martial cultivators in the Void Sacred Tree.”

“While that spirit formation will not cause any harm, it is extremely powerful and simply impossible to breach. Thus, if one wants to train in the Void Sacred Tree, one must wait for the spirit formation to disappear by itself.”

“Generally, that spirit formation will disappear once every hundred years. However, it is difficult to tell when it will reappear. Generally, it will reappear within a period of ten to thirty days. It is very irregular.”

“Furthermore, it has only been fifty years since the last time the Void Sacred Tree opened. Yet, an unforeseen event has actually occurred.”

“After the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain’s natural energies weakened greatly, with the Purple Sun Sacred Palace having been taken away by that mysterious expert and the Nine Moons Sacred Domain being monopolized by the Chu Heavenly Clan, and with the Ethereal Sacred Gate and the Darknight Sacred River being evermoving, the Void Sacred Tree is the only one of the Six Great Sacred Vestiges that the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm can train in.”

“And now, an unforeseen event has occurred in the Void Sacred Tree. Naturally, it would alarm all of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s powers.”

“I feel that even the Chu Heavenly Clan will proceed to the Void Sacred Tree to investigate things.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“As for us, once we return to the Sacred Pellet Villa, we will immediately proceed for the Void Sacred Tree with our Lord Villa Master,” Elder Ma Changchun said.

“Senior, exactly what is this unforeseen event?” Chu Feng realized that an unforeseen event at the Void Sacred Tree was indeed something that could shake the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Experts from various powers would all be dispatched there.

Because of this, Chu Feng wanted to know what had happened even more.

“No one is capable of breaching the spirit formation around the Void Sacred Tree. Not even the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief is capable of breaching it. We can only wait for the spirit formation to disappear by itself. Only then will we be able to enter the Void Sacred Tree.”

“However, in recent days, someone has managed to see someone in the Void Sacred Tree. That person was moving about within the Void Sacred Tree’s spirit formation,” Elder Ma Changchun said.

“In other words, someone has managed to successfully breach the spirit formation and enter the Void Sacred Tree?” Chu Feng was also very surprised.
