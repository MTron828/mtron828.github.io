Chapter 4915: Xian Miaomiao’s Death

Chu Feng shot a glance at Shengguang Baimei and the others.

The latter immediately caught Chu Feng’s drift and quickly concealed their presence. However, they remained on their guard, ready to jump in to protect Chu Feng if the need arose.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng walked up to Xian Miaomiao’s mother and asked, “Elder, where did Miaomiao go?”

Xian Miaomiao’s mother was so out of it that she didn’t even notice Chu Feng’s approach. However, the moment she heard the name ‘Miaomiao’, her body shuddered and she slowly rose her head.

Her eyes widened the moment she saw Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng?!”

Even though the two of them had never met before, it was still clear from her expression that she recognized Chu Feng.

“Elder, I am Miaomiao’s friend, Chu Feng. I heard that a mishap has occurred to Miaomiao. Rumor has it that you were the one who killed Miaomiao. However, it appears from the circumstances that you’re framed. Elder… what really happened here? Can you tell me where Miaomiao is right now?” Chu Feng asked.

“Miaomiao, I have let you down! I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”

Xian Miaomiao’s mother lost control of her emotions the moment they started talking about Miaomiao.

Shoosh!

A white pearl flew toward Chu Feng. Daoist Niantian had thrown it over.

“Chu Feng, she’s in a poor condition physically and mentally wise. Place this pearl on her forehead,” Daoist Niantian said via voice transmission.

“My apologies, elder.”

Chu Feng placed the white pearl on the forehead of Xian Miaomiao’s mother, and under Daoist Niantian’s activation, it morphed into a wisp of white smoke that seeped into her head.

A moment later, the emotional state of Xian Miaomiao’s mother appeared to have stabilized.

“Chu Feng, I know that you’re here for Miaomiao, but it’s all too late. Miaomiao… is no longer around.”

Despite having regained her mental stability, Xian Miaomiao’s mother wouldn’t stop crying.

Chu Feng’s heart turned heavy seeing her state. He was unwilling to accept Xian Miaomiao’s death, but it was hard for him to turn his eyes away from reality when even Xian Miaomiao’s mother was giving him such a reply.

However, he knew that this wasn’t the time to be wallowing in grief. Sorrow wouldn’t solve anything.

“Elder, I’m here for Miaomiao. Can you tell me what happened? How did Miaomiao die? Even if she’s truly dead, I want to know who is the one who landed her in this plight,” Chu Feng said.

“The culprit is my older brother, the Nine Soul Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief. It’s all my fault. It’s my foolishness that landed Miaomiao in this plight.”

Xian Miaomiao’s mother began telling Chu Feng about her story.

Xian Miaomiao’s mother had long wanted to bring Xian Miaomiao into the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but she dared not to look for Xian Miaomiao without obtaining her older brother’s approval. She was afraid that her older brother would kill Xian Miaomiao for her impure bloodline.

Her older brother was aware of Xian Miaomiao’s existence, but he disapproved of bringing Xian Miaomiao into the clan.&nbsp;

It was just that her older brother suddenly changed her mind one day. He promised to confer Xian Miaomiao with the title of a princess once she returned to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

Xian Miaomiao’s mother was initially filled with skepticism regarding this. She sought confirmation on multiple occasions, but it would appear that her older brother was serious about this.&nbsp;

That was also when she finally made a move and brought Xian Miaomiao into the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

The Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief also fulfilled the end of his promise and conferred Xian Miaomiao as a princess. He treated Xian Miaomiao kindly, as if she was his own daughter. He even allowed his own daughter, Princess Qiu, to interact with Xian Miaomiao.

It was just that…&nbsp;

“It’s all my fault! I was the one who landed Miaomiao in her current plight!”

Xian Miaomiao’s mother burst into tears. Tears wouldn’t stop trickling from her face out of utmost sorrow. Regret and guilt could be seen on her face.

“Elder, what happened?” Chu Feng asked.

It was already clear to him that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief had a hand in Miaomiao’s death, but he still wanted to get to the bottom of things.&nbsp;

“It was all a scheme. The Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief had another daughter aside from Princess Qiu, which is his youngest daughter, Princess Xiaoxiao.

“Princess Xiaoxiao is afflicted with a deadly disease that threatens to claim her life. There is only one way to treat her, and that’s to trade another person’s life for hers,” Xian Miaomiao’s mother said.

The problem was that there were four criteria that needed to be fulfilled if they wanted to use someone to trade for Princess Xiaoxiao’s life.&nbsp;

Firstly, that person must be a woman.

Secondly, that person must be a junior.

Thirdly, that person must be a member of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

Fourthly, that person’s Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s bloodline must sufficiently strong.

Close kin fulfilled these criteria better than those from the side family.

“So, Xian Miaomiao became the medicine to treat Princess Xiaoxiao?” Chu Feng asked with inconcealable rage.

“Yes. I wanted to take Miaomiao away with me when I learned of that matter, but it was already all too late. I could only watch with my own eyes as Miaomiao was captured by them. Right before my eyes, they took Miaomiao’s life away,” Xian Miaomiao’s mother sobbed.

“That’s not right, Chu Feng. Most people saw with their own eyes how Princess Miaomiao’s mother took away her own daughter’s life,” Shengguang Buyu told Chu Feng through voice transmission.

He wanted Chu Feng to continue investigating the matter to understand the full situation.

It was just that Chu Feng wasn’t in any mood to continue pursuing this matter anymore. Instead, he asked the question that he was the most concerned about.

“Elder, is Miaomiao really dead? Can you confirm that?”

Xian Miaomiao’s mother cried even more sorrowfully upon hearing that question. Her response was the loudest answer.

Chu Feng closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. It took a long moment of silence before he finally calmed his feelings of anger and sorrow. He looked at Xian Miaomiao’s mother once more and said, “Elder, your older brother has killed your daughter. Are you still going to side with your older brother and Princess Xiaoxiao even now?”

“Side with them?”

The face of Xian Miaomiao’s mother changed upon hearing those words. A vicious glint flashed across her eyes as murderous intent seeped out from her body.&nbsp;

“As long as there’s a single breath left in me, I swear that I’ll take their life. I’ll slaughter them and avenge Miaomiao!”

Those words were spoken through gritted teeth. Chu Feng could sense her fury.

“Elder, tell me where are the people who have caused Miaomiao’s death,” Chu Feng asked.
