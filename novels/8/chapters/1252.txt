MGA: Chapter 1253 - A Battle Of Words

“It seems that the origins of these Monstrous Dragon Beasts are quite extraordinary?” Hearing the discussion of the crowd, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Monstrous Dragon Beasts seemed to be very remarkable.

“The Monstrous Dragon Beasts are indeed no ordinary monstrous beasts. They can be said to be a distant relative to the legendary divine beast, the Dragon. Even though they only possess a tiny bit of relation with the Dragon, it nevertheless causes them to have quite a powerful standing among the monstrous beasts,” Bai Ruochen said.

“The Monstrous Dragon Beasts are separated into many different kinds too. In the Holy Land of Martialism, the most powerful Monstrous Dragon Beasts are the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts.”

“Those King Monstrous Dragon Beasts are extremely powerful. It is said that their successive chiefs have always been Martial Emperor-level monstrous beasts.”

“Even this Cyanwood Mountain would not necessarily dare to casually provoke them.”

“Yet now, the Cyanwood Mountain wants to exterminate all of the Monstrous Dragon Beasts. It is likely that this group of Monstrous Dragon Beasts are not a pure breed. At the very least, they would likely be unrelated to the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. Otherwise, they would not be arrogant enough to say to exterminate them.”

Sima Ying immediately explained things to Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen. As a member of the World Spiritist Alliance, she knew a lot more about the matters of the Holy Land of Martialism than they did.

“A hundred thousand Achievement Points, that is no small number. As for the harvest and the investment, they are generally directly proportional to one another.”

“The greater the reward, the more difficult the mission will be. It can be seen that even if this group of Monstrous Dragon Beasts are not pure-blooded, they will still not be that easy to deal with,” Bai Ruochen said with a sigh.

As a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain, she deeply wished to participate in this mission, behead that Monstrous Dragon Beast’s chief’s head and exchange it for a hundred thousand Achievement Points. Unfortunately, she could not.

Even though she felt a large amount of regret, she still calmly said, “Chu Feng, let’s go. In a couple more days, my mother will come to pick us up. This dragon grade mission is destined to be unrelated with us.”

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded. After that, the three of them turned around and prepared to leave.

“You’ve already come, why rush to leave?” However, right at the moment when the three of them were planning to leave, an unkind voice sounded from the area where the disciples were gathering to receive the dragon grade mission.

As for this voice, it was Bai Yunxiao’s voice. Not only did Bai Yunxiao discover the three of them, he spoke with a voice that led the crowd to notice the three of them as well.

In an instant, the people surrounding Chu Feng began to rapidly spread aside. Everyone noticed that Chu Feng and the others were turning their backs toward the Mission Plaza and were planning to leave.

“We came and now felt like leaving. What does that have to do with you?” Sima Ying turned around and answered ruthlessly.

“My senior brother Bai is speaking, when did it become your time to interrupt? Did I not beat you enough or what?” Tao Xianyu shouted coldly.

“Sigh, junior sister Tao, that red-haired girl is nothing more than an outsider. There is no need for you to lower yourself to her level. Just consider her speech to be nothing more than the barks from a dog,” Qi Yanyu spoke. However, his tone was extremely eccentric, and he actually insulted Sima Ying as a dog.

“F*ck you, who the f*ck did you say is a dog?” How could Sima Ying possibly contain herself after being insulted in such a manner? After cursing in rage, she charged to attack.

“Sima Ying, do not act up, elders are present. If you are to take the initiative to attack, you’ll end up being in the wrong,” Seeing this, Bai Ruochen immediately grabbed Sima Ying’s arm and softly urged her against doing anything.

Although Sima Ying had a very violent temperament and impulsive behavior, she was not ignorant enough to not know about the greater situation. After hearing what Bai Ruochen said, she calmed herself down.

“Yoh, so it turns out that even a mad dog can be this obedient. Junior sister Ruochen, it seems that you’ve managed to tame this feral dog. I suppose you did not end up being ravaged by our junior sister Tao here for her in vain,” However, Qi Yanyu did not stop at only that. Not only did he continued to insult Sima Ying, he even turned to insult Bai Ruochen too.

“Dog? The person who’s loudly barking insults at two girls right now is you.”

“If you want to speak of dogs, then how could there be anyone more dog-like than you?” Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke.

Compared to Sima Ying and Bai Ruochen, who were resisting their anger with great difficulty, Chu Feng was much calmer. Even when he spoke to insult Qi Yanyu, he did so in a cultured, refined, calm and composed manner.

“Who did you insult to be a dog?” Being insulted by Chu Feng in such a manner, Qi Yanyu was immediately enraged. To someone like Qi Yanyu, their ego was extremely high. While they could insult others, they could not stand others insulting them.

“Insult? I think you’re mistaken, I was merely speaking of the truth. I wasn’t insulting you at all,” Chu Feng spread his arms wide and shrugged his shoulders as he shook his head. He appeared as if he were completely innocent.

“Bullshit!” Qi Yanyu cursed out loudly. Compared to earlier, he became even angrier. That was because Chu Feng was stating that he, Qi Yanyu, was a dog to begin with.

“Are you not a dog? Look, have the senior brothers and sisters here take a look at your face. They can be the ones to judge whether you, Qi Yanyu, look like a dog or not.”

“Look at his face[1.raw said eyebrows but dogs have no eyebrows...] and then look at his eyes. Doesn’t he appear just like a dog?” Chu Feng pointed at Qi Yanyu and spoke with a loud voice.

Originally, no one thought that Qi Yanyu looked like a dog. However, after being told so by Chu Feng, when they looked at Qi Yanyu again, they truly felt that his appearance resembled that of a dog.

Even though the crowd did not dare to agree with Chu feng’s viewpoint, some of them were unable to contain their intention to laugh, and began to cover their mouths.

“Sigh, Qi Yanyu, tell me honestly, are you a monstrous beast? Is your monstrous beast form that of a feral dog?” Seeing that his insult was effective, Chu Feng continued with his attacks and insults.

“Chu Feng, you’re courting death!” To be insulted as a dog by Chu Feng over and over again, Qi Yanyu was truly unable to contain his anger anymore. His eyebrows frowned, and a flash shone past his eyes. He actually released his powerful aura and was planning to attack Chu Feng.

“Stop.” However, right at this moment, Bai Yunxiao shouted loudly and angrily. Furthermore, as he spoke, he took a glance at the Punishment Department’s elders behind him.

At this time, Bai Yunxiao discovered that the expressions on the Punishment Department’s elders were rather ugly; they appeared to be angry. However, it was evident that they were not angry because of Chu Feng. Instead, they were angry because of him.

At such a time, the elders should have stepped in to stop this right away, and not allow disciples to insult each other before outsiders.

However, they did not do that. The reason why they had not was precisely because they wanted Qi Yanyu and those with him to obtain the upper hand and insult Chu Feng as they wished.

After all, they all greatly disliked Chu Feng. Even though they were elders, they still looked forward to Chu Feng being humiliated.

Yet, never would they have imagined that in merely several sentences, Qi Yanyu was unable to contain himself anymore and wanted to attack. This greatly disappointed the elders of the Punishment Department.

After all, if it was a battle of words, then it would be fine. However, if they were to attack for no reason at all, and in front of a management elder on top of that, it would be them who would be in the wrong.

In this sort of situation, the party that attacked first would be punished.

Thus, it must be said that the elders of the Punishment Department were truly disappointed in Qi Yanyu’s performance. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qi Yanyu was no fool. He was able to sense the displeasure of the elders. Thus, he did not dare to say anything, nor did he dare to attack. Instead, he forcibly contained the anger in his heart, lowered his head and spoke no more.
