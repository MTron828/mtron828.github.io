Chapter 5838: The Assault of the Ancient Era’s Clans

“What an incredible sight! I would have never expected the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s cultivators to be so determined.”

Powerful cultivators were shaken up by the prowess displayed by the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. This was not just due to the prowess of the protective formation but the unity of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s cultivators too.

Those who had previously looked down on the Ancestral Martial Galaxy looked at it in a different light. What they saw today was not a bunch of scattered sand but an army of valiant warriors.

All of a sudden, six massive spirit formation gates appeared outside the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Countless figures flew out neatly from the spirit formation gates. These spirit formation gates were huge, making humans look like dust in comparison. Even massive beasts of over tens of thousands of meters in height looked insignificant before the spirit formation gates.

It only looked inconspicuous as they were appearing in the middle of space. Had they descended in a realm instead, the scene would have surely been grand.

“They are here. They are all foreign faces, but their flags emanated the aura of the Ancient Era. The Ancient Era’s clans are really going to attack the Ancestral Martial Galaxy!”

“Their auras are formidable! They aren’t pushovers.”

The present-era cultivators retreated even further back upon seeing the Ancient Era’s clans. The Ancient Era’s clans were stronger than they had expected. Without a doubt, these must have been their elites. On the whole, the prowess of these six Ancient Era’s clans wouldn’t pale in comparison to any of the galaxy overlords.

Outer space tended to be peaceful, devoid of wind and oppressive might. However, the appearance of the powerful Ancient Era’s clans stirred a furious storm. The flags fluttered, allowing the crowd to identify their backgrounds.

The ones dressed in the world spiritist cloaks—the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion.

The ones possessing the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline—the Tuoba Heavenly Clan.

The ones shrouded in a black light—Myriad Night Ancient Sect.

The ones shrouded in nine-colored flames—Nine Regions Divine Hall.

The ones with blood-colored wings—Blood Phoenix Royal Clan.

The ones whose heights easily reached tens of thousand meters, with a body that had eight legs, a humanoid upper half, skin reminiscent of stone, and fists resembling hammers—the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan.

“How stubborn. The Ancestral Martial Galaxy intends to oppose us?” an old voice echoed.

The crowd turned their eyes toward an incomparably small silhouette. Unlike the six clans from the Ancient Era, he was dressed in a black cloak that covered his entire body.

“Is that Puppeteer Exalted? I heard he dresses up like that.”

“That’s probably him. I heard he’s the one who orchestrated this operation. Just who in the world is he to bring the Ancient Era’s clans together like that?”

The crowd eyes Puppeteer Exalted with curious eyes.

Seeing no response to his words, Puppeteer Exalted shook his head and casually waved his hand. “Let’s make a move.”

Shoosh!

An incomparably huge hammer smashed toward the Ancestral Martial Galaxy like a shooting star whizzing the pitch-black night sky. The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan had made the first move.

The other powers followed suit.

Some constructed powerful formations. Some executed formidable martial skills. All kinds of means were executed, emitting brilliant light that lit up the night sky like fireworks. However, these weren’t fireworks but powerful attacks that could easily obliterate countless lives.

Yet, the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation blocked off all of these attacks, including those from pinnacle True God level cultivators.

This formation was the real deal.

However, Puppeteer Exalted wasn’t worried in the least, as if he had expected such a situation. A small spirit formation gate appeared in front of him, and he calmly stepped in. It led him into a vast realm, where the experts of the six clans of the Ancient Era were gathered.

Six experts had reached the ranks of Heavenly God level or Heavenly Dragon. They were the six leaders of the Ancient Era’s clans.

There was also a massive formation inside the realm made out of countless treasures from the Ancient Era and Immemorial Era. This formation itself was already a priceless treasure.

It had nine formation cores, one located at the center and the other eight surrounding it.

“Everyone, I told you it won’t be that easy to breach that formation. Let’s go with my plan,” Puppeteer Exalted said as he leaped into the center formation core.

The six leaders of the Ancient Era’s clans could also tell that the formation wouldn’t be easily breached, so they raised their hands and their subordinates relayed their orders. Their members halted their attacks and returned to this realm.

Upon returning to this realm, they quickly made their way into six of the outer formation cores.

There were still two empty formation cores, so Puppeteer Exalted took out an ancient flag, planted it on the ground, and formed a hand seal.

Whoosh!

The space shook. Even those who had come to spectate but ended up retreating a far distance away could feel the tremors. They traced the source of the tremors and found that it was coming from the spot where Puppeteer Exalted had first appeared.

There was a brilliant burst of light, and a spirit formation gate appeared amid space.

This wasn’t any ordinary spirit formation gate. Spirit power quickly surged into it, as it emanated a light more brilliant than any realm.

“What a terrifying power. The energy harnessed inside the formation exceeds True God level.”

The spectators backed even further away out of fear.

Boom! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just then, a terrifying pillar of energy gushed out of the spirit formation gate. Even the experts standing a distance away found it hard to maintain their balance. The shockwaves were more than enough to cause their floating warships to wobble unstably.

This terrifying pillar of light was coming from the powerful formation channeled by the six Ancient Era’s clans.

It shot across space and rammed right into the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation. The shockwaves produced by the clash spanned the size of a starfield. If not for the protective formation, countless realms would have been destroyed by this blast, and those living in them would have died unknowingly.

This attack was on a different level than the earlier assault.

However, those channeling the formation, including the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clansmen, clenched their jaws in pain. Clearly, they had to pay a heavy price for this.
