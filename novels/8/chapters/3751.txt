Chapter 3751 - Defending One’s Honor With One’s Life

The surroundings grew absolutely silent.

However, the crowd’s hearts were surging like giant waves.

The crowd truly never expected that Chu Feng would really dig out Linghu Hongfei’s eyes.

Not only did he dig out Linghu Hongfei’s eyes, but he even completely destroyed them.

Furthermore, he did all of that before Linghu Zhishi and all the experts of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Could Chu Feng really be planning to challenge the authority of the Linghu Heavenly Clan?

What made him think he was qualified to challenge their authority?

Even the Wuming Clan that had ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield for tens of thousands of years was defeated by the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

How could Chu Feng possibly challenge them?

Although confused, the crowd still subconsciously turned their gazes to Linghu Zhishi.

They all wanted to know how the number one individual in the Ancestral Martial Starfield was going to take care of Chu Feng.

At that moment, Linghu Zhishi’s face had turned deep red with fury. His veins were bulging explosively.

The crowd even felt like they could hear the sound of Linghu Zhishi gnashing his teeth.

Needless to say, he was completely enraged by Chu Feng’s actions.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had not only destroyed Linghu Hongfei’s eyes, but his action was also an act of provocation to Linghu Zhishi. He was not placing him in his eyes.

“Chu Feng, you will pay for your actions,” said Linghu Zhishi.

Linghu Zhishi was truly worthy of being the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

He possessed outstanding tolerance. Even though he was completely enraged and surging with killing intent, he did not directly attack Chu Feng.

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, several figures appeared before Chu Feng and surrounded him from all directions.

They were Gu Mingyuan, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Xuanzhengfa.

They knew that Chu Feng had courted a disaster, and Linghu Zhishi could be planning to murder him at any moment.

With the situation being like that, they simply could not afford to do nothing. Thus, all of them rushed forward to protect him.

“Clan Chief Linghu, if you plan to kill Chu Feng, then you’ll have to first thread past this old man’s corpse,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said loudly.

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was not only very good-natured, but he was also very humble.

As the clan chief of the Chu Heavenly Clan, he had always considered the greater good of the clan.

Thus, when he encountered people or powers stronger than the Chu Heavenly Clan, he would always be very humble.

However, this time around, he was completely different. He showed no signs of servitude.

Even when faced with an existence like Linghu Zhishi, he did not back down in the slightest.

He seemed like he was prepared to face death.

“No need to fret, today, all of you will die.”

Linghu Zhishi let out a cold smile. Then, he shouted, “Where are my Linghu Heavenly Clansmen?!!”

“Milord, we are here!!!”

Once Linghu Zhishi spoke, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen inside the warships and outside the warships all stood up uniformly. They had all drawn their weapons.

From their appearance, as long as Linghu Zhishi gave the order, they would immediately unleash a massacre upon the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

“Where are my Chu Heavenly Clansmen?!”

To the crowd’s surprise, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief also let out a loud shout.

Even more unexpected was that after he gave the order, all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen also rushed out and stood behind him in an orderly manner.

They seemed like they were truly planning to fight the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen to death.

In fact, that was precisely the case.

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen already knew that this day would not end well.

Regardless of whether Chu Feng won or lost, their Chu Heavenly Clan was still destined to suffer a calamity.

Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had already had the great majority of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen leave ahead of time.

They’d all gone to Ancestral Martial Dragon City. After all, that place was the safest place to be.

The remaining Chu Heavenly Clansmen were people that were determined to face death. Even if they were to die, they would still defend their Chu Heavenly Clan’s honor.

“Striking a stone with an egg, this is simply striking a stone with an egg.”

“The Chu Heavenly Clan is truly overestimating their capabilities.”

Seeing the Chu Heavenly Clansmen looking like they were planning to confront the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, the crowd did not show them respect and honor. Instead, they were rolling their eyes and ridiculing them.

“Sure enough, your Chu Heavenly Clan is already prepared to have a falling-out with my Linghu Heavenly Clan.”

Seeing those Chu Heavenly Clansmen, Linghu Zhishi showed no sign of surprise. Instead, the corners of his mouth rose into a strange curve.

At the same time, he made another action.

“Paa~~~”

“Paa~~~”

He clapped his hands, and then an enormous warship started to rumble.

Then, under the crowd’s gazes, the enormous warship opened up. The inside of the warship could be seen clearly by the crowd.

“That is?!!!”

Once the warship opened, the crowd were all stunned.

They were all able to clearly see that there were hundreds of thousands of people inside the warship. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, those people were not from the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Instead, they were all Chu Heavenly Clansmen.

Furthermore, those people, regardless of whether they were old or young, men or women, even the newborn infants, were all tied up by black chains.

They were prisoners. The Chu Heavenly Clansmen had all been reduced to prisoners.

“Linghu Zhishi, you!!!”

Witnessing that scene, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others’ expressions all changed enormously.

It was impossible for them to not recognize their own clansmen. They knew very well that those clansmen of theirs were all people that had gone to seek shelter in Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

“You all appeared to be heroic, fearless and willing to die in battle.”

“However, you’d secretly transferred the great majority of your clansmen away.”

“Did you plan to have Ancestral Martial Dragon City nurture your younger generations?”

“Clan Chief Chu, you’re truly playing quite a hand.”

“Unfortunately, did you really think our Linghu Heavenly Clan to be fools?”

“Your each and every action was already within my grasp.”

The smile on Linghu Zhishi’s face became even more pleased.

At that moment, the crowd came to a realization...

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen that had departed for Ancestral Martial Dragon City were all captured by the Linghu Heavenly Clan enroute.

It turned out that Linghu Zhishi had planned to eliminate the Chu Heavenly Clan from the very start.

Even a fool could tell that he had no intentions to spare them.

Even if Chu Feng hadn’t dug out Linghu Hongfei’s eyes, the Chu Heavenly Clan would still not be able to escape the fate of extermination.

After all, Linghu Zhishi had planned this from the very start.

Having witnessed the truth at that moment, the crowd’s expressions became complicated.

The Linghu Heavenly Clan’s manner of conduct was simply too ruthless. They simply did not care what the crowd thought of them.

The crowd also knew why the Linghu Heavenly Clan had decided to do all this. Naturally, it was because of Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was a thorn in their eyes, a sting to their heart, and a threat to their position.

Thus, they must erase him.

But, even if that was the case, their manner of conduct was simply still too vicious. The crowd were capable of understanding the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s intention to eliminate Chu Feng. However, to eliminate the entire Chu Heavenly Clan because of Chu Feng was simply too excessive.

Thinking back, even though the Wuming Clan was also ruthless in their own way when they ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they still had a bottom line.

The Wuming Clan had most definitely defeated Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan.

Yet, they did not attempt to directly eliminate them. More than that, they never thought of eliminating the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.
