Chapter 4533 - Nearly Vomiting Blood In Rage

“Rank seven Utmost Exalted. Father, you’ve... you’ve made a breakthrough in cultivation?”

Seeing Long Daozhi’s current cultivation, the worried frown on Long Ning’s face disappeared. It was replaced with a look of utter shock.

It was not only her. The others from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were also overjoyed by this sudden turn of events.

They clearly remembered Long Daozhi’s cultivation to be rank six Utmost Exalted. Yet, the aura he was emitting was that of a rank seven Utmost Exalted!

“It is all thanks to young friend Chu Feng that I was able to make a breakthrough.

“If it wasn’t for young friend Chu Feng, Her Highness of the Dragon Clan wouldn’t have rewarded me with their Dragon Clan’s precious treasure, the Dragon Vein Source Stone.

“It is through using that Dragon Vein Source Stone that I was able to make this breakthrough so smoothly,” said Long Daozhi.

Hearing those words, Long Ning’s expression turned complicated as she looked at Chu Feng.

She seemed to realize why her father insisted on protecting Chu Feng, sparing no effort to use all their Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s treasures and resources to do so.

Once the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect heard what Long Daozhi said, they started to panic slightly.

“Her Highness of the Dragon Clan? That Chu Feng knew the Dragon Clan’s princess?”

Many elders and disciples revealed a slight amount of fear in their eyes as they looked at Chu Feng.

This was especially true for the female disciple that offended Chu Feng initially. She did not even dare to look at his face.

“Long Daozhi, never would I expect that you’ll dare to spout all kinds of nonsense for the sake of protecting that brat.

“Her Highness of the Dragon Clan? How could a brat like that know the Dragon Clan’s princess?

“What you’ve said is simply an insult toward the Dragon Clan,” said the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster. He did not believe Chu Feng knew the Dragon Clan’s princess.

“Sectmaster Dian, what I said is absolutely true. Young friend Chu Feng is a close friend of the Dragon Clan’s Princess Xiaoxiao.

“If you don’t believe me, you can very well go and investigate this matter,” said Long Daozhi loudly.

He deliberately mentioned Chu Feng’s relationship with Long Xiaoxiao. He wanted to push the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect to a difficult situation so that they would back off. In the end, he still didn’t wish to have a complete fall-out with the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.

“Long Daozhi, did you take us for fools?

“It is obvious to everyone that you possessed an extraordinary relationship with that Chu Feng. Had it not been for that, you wouldn’t have agreed to my demands.

“After all, while returning to the Dragon Clan is an important matter to you, you still pondered over the condition I spoke of for multiple days. Yet, for that brat’s life, you were willing to accept my condition doubled.

“With how extraordinary of a relationship the two of you have, if he’s close friends with High Highness, he would’ve most definitely helped you return to the Dragon Clan.

“There wouldn’t be any need for you all to come seek for our Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s help, seek for my younger brother’s help.

“There could only be a single explanation for this -- that brat simply doesn’t know the Dragon Clan’s princess at all. Even if he does, they would at most be acquaintances, strangers coming together by pure chance,” said the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s sectmaster.

The people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Clan felt their sectmaster’s words sounded very reasonable.

Because of that, the fear disappeared from their hearts and they once again became aggressive toward Chu Feng. Their hatred toward Chu Feng even grew stronger than before.

They all felt that they were deceived. The feeling of being deceived was extremely unpleasant to them.

“Big brother, that Long Daozhi had grown tired of living! He actually dared to injure me! Kill him for me!”

“Today, I will have the Ancestral Martial Dragon City disappear from this world!”

Dian Kuang arrived beside the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster.

“Little brother, you can rest assured. Big brother will definitely uphold justice for you.”

After saying those words, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster looked to Long Daozhi.

“Long Daozhi, you shouldn’t have done this. You should’ve never ruined your Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s future for the sake of a brat like that.

“As you’ve enraged my little brother, not even the celestial emperor himself would be able to save you.

“Now, you can only pay with your life.”

“Woosh---”

After he finished saying those words, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster unleashed his oppressive might.

The heaven and earth immediately grew dark. The surrounding palaces immediately shattered apart.

He... was actually also a rank seven Utmost Exalted level expert.

“Chu Feng, bring Long Ning and back away from here.”

As matters stood, Long Daozhi realized that there was no way out.

The person in the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect that cannot be afforded to provoke the most was not their sectmaster. Instead, it was the sectmaster’s younger brother Dian Kuang.

Now that Dian Kuang was determined to kill him, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster would definitely not show any leniency.

“Senior, you don’t have to hold back. You can kill them directly.”

“I will shoulder the responsibility of their deaths,” Chu Feng said to Long Daozhi.

But, Long Daozhi did not dare to respond to those words.

“Young friend Chu Feng, please don’t say anything anymore.”

The elders of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City began to dissuade Chu Feng.

They were simply unable to watch on any longer. Why was Chu Feng so determined to die today?

However, Chu Feng simply ignored them. Seeing that Long Daozhi was unresponsive, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster.

“Hey, why are you still standing there? C’mon, attack.”

“But, let me warn you ahead of time. If you are to attack us, I guarantee that you will not be able to leave this place alive,” Chu Feng pointed at the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster as he said those words.

Hearing those words, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster grew so furious that the corner of his mouth started twitching.

“Good, good, good. What an arrogant little brat. This old man had journeyed all over the martial cultivation world but never had I ever encountered someone who’s unafraid of death like the way you are.”

“Brat, remember carefully. Today, both you and the Ancestral Martial Dragon City shall perish from this world!”

“This is all your fault! It is all because you’ve offended people that you shouldn’t have!”

As the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster roared furiously, he soared into the sky.

His oppressive might was not only charging toward Long Daozhi, it was also aiming at Chu Feng and Long Ning.

But, his oppressive might failed to injure Chu Feng and Long Ning.

Turned out, his oppressive might was completely blocked by Long Daozhi.

“Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, I, Long Daozhi, had tolerated you all again and again!”

“But, you all continued to press on with your aggression. Since that’s the case, I, Long Daozhi, will have you all realize exactly what sort of person I am!” roared Long Daozhi.

Seeing that there was no way out, Loing Daozhi finally let the anger he suppressed in his heart explode.

The two rank seven Utmost Exalted both soared upward.

Then, explosions sounded from all directions and energy ripples began to wreak havoc.

Long Daozhi was locked in battle against the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster.

Even though the experts from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City and Flying Feather Heavenly Sect were all present at this place, they were all only standing to the side. None of them engaged in battle with the opposing party.

Instead, they all retreated further away from the battle.

After all, the two people fighting in the sky above were two rank seven Utmost Exalted level experts.

Rank seven Utmost Exalted was a cultivation far superior to all the people present. They simply do not dare to approach the battle. They were afraid that they would be implicated.

In a battle of experts that are powerful, a single oppressive might would be able to completely destroy their body and shatter their soul.

“Chu Feng, look at what you’ve done.”

“Our Ancestral Martial Dragon City is now ruined. This is all your fault. This is all your fault.”

Long Ning was furious. Tears were flowing down from her eyes nonstop. Standing next to Chu Feng, she continued to blame him without stopping.

“Miss Long, don’t cry. You’re crying in vain. You’re wasting your tears, understand?

“Rest assured. With me here, nothing will happen to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. At least, the Flying Feather Heavenly Clan will possess no threat to your Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

“While it is true that someone will end up suffering today, that someone will be the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Clan and not the people from your Ancestral Martial Dragon City,” Chu Feng comforted Long Ning.

“You... you... you...”

Hearing those words, Long Ning grew speechless from anger.

“Chu Feng, why did you become like this? Did you lose control over your mind from training?

“With the way Long Ning has been persuading you, telling you not to come here, why did you still insist on coming here?

“Look at the situation now? Is this what you wanted? The Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s years of continuation will be ruined by your hands.”

At this moment, even Kong Ci and Xian Yun arrived beside Chu Feng.

They knew what happened and felt sorry for Long Ning. Because of that, they also began to criticize Chu Feng.

“That’s right. This is exactly what I wanted. I wish to see exactly how strong senior Long Daozhi is now,” said Chu Feng.

“What, you...”

“Madness! You’ve most definitely gone mad!”

Chu Feng’s words left Kong Ci and Xian Yun speechless.

As for the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, they were all gnashing their teeth furiously.

But, Chu Feng did not bother to pay attention to them. His gaze remained focused on Long Daozhi and the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster’s battle. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

These two men both possess a cultivation of rank seven Utmost Exalted.

Furthermore, Chu Feng could tell that the two of them seemed to have both just become rank seven Utmost Exalteds. Because of that, neither of them had attained complete control of their rank seven Utmost Exalted level strength.

But, it was clear from their fight that Long Daozhi was a bit stronger.

Truth was, Chu Feng had already heard about Long Daozhi’s strength.

After all, when Long Daozhi fought against the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master, they both had the cultivation of rank six Utmost Exalted.

But, in that battle, Long Daozhi managed to defeat the Purple Star Hall’s Hall Master in a very short period of time.

From this, it could be seen that even though Long Daozhi does not possess the ability to increase his cultivation as an Utmost Exalted, his battle power and battle experience were very powerful.
