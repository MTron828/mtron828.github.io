Chapter 4488: Chu Feng Lies

“Then... should we still cultivate in the Whitesky Star River?” Yin Daifen asked.

It was true that there was something sinister about the Whitesky Star River right now, but it wasn’t easy for them to find a good cultivation spot either. No cultivator would like it if an opportunity were to slip past his fingers, and Yin Daifen was the same too.

“Cultivate? Even a powerful race of the Ancient Era had died in there, and you still want to enter the river to cultivate? If you want to die, go ahead! I won’t stop you!” the Supreme Elder of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect berated Yin Daifen in vexation.

He felt that Yin Daifen’s words were simply too ignorant.

“Miss Yin, we might not have seen anything in there earlier, but there’s a good chance that we might have just escaped death narrowly earlier. Remember these words, ‘there’s hope as long as you’re alive’. There are many cultivation spots in the world, there is no need for you to risk your life over just one of them,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief advised Yin Daifen.

The others also expressed their agreement to not return to the Whitesky Star River anymore.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you’re going to participate in the tournament that’s going to happen a few days from now, right?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster suddenly asked Chu Feng.

“Tournament? What is that?” Chu Feng asked.

“You don’t know about the tournament to determine the strongest junior?”

Everyone was astonished to hear that Chu Feng actually didn’t know about this matter.

“Can anyone fill me in on this matter?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

Based on the explanation from the crowd, Chu Feng found out what the so-called tournament was about.

To put it simply, it was a new initiative that the Holy Light Clan started in order to nurture the talented juniors of the Holy Light Galaxy. The tournament was going to be held for the first time a few days from now, and the Holy Light Clan was planning to organize it once every three years.

As long as one was a junior within the Holy Light Galaxy, one would be eligible to participate in the tournament.

According to the rumors, anyone who got into the top hundred within the tournament would be entitled to a reward, and the reward would be much more generous if one were to get into the top ten.

And as for the reward for the champion, it had been officially announced by the Holy Light Clan to be a very precious cultivation resource known as the Holy Light Bloodline Essence.

It was said that the Holy Light Bloodline Essence was concocted using a secret treasure that had been passed down through the lineage within the Holy Light Clan. It was said to bring about great benefits if a person of the younger generation consumed it.

“I didn’t know that there was such an event. It looks like we’ll be meeting one another again in the near future,” Chu Feng smiled at Long Xiaoxiao and the others as he spoke.

Long Xiaoxiao, Yin Daifen, Hong Yu, Hong Yin, and the others were the most outstanding juniors in the Holy Light Galaxy at the moment. This tournament was created for them, so it went without saying that they would have to make an appearance.

Putting aside the prizes, this was a good opportunity for them to make their name.

Take Long Xiaoxiao and the others for example, while their strength was considerably formidable amongst the younger generation, there were very few people who knew of their name.

If they could build up their reputation through the tournament, it would serve as an invaluable asset to them when they moved on to build their own influence in the future.

“The first place is indubitably Brother Chu Feng’s to take, but we’ll still be joining in the commotion,” the Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s Fu Feiyue remarked.

Fu Feiyue looked down on Chu Feng so much in the past, but at this moment, he was addressing Chu Feng as ‘brother’, as if they were close friends to one another.

But despite the smile on his face, he still couldn’t fully conceal the fear that was in his eyes. He wanted to get close to Chu Feng, but at the same time, he was deeply afraid of the latter too.

“Young friend Chu Feng, allow me to offer some words of advice to you,” Elder Gongsun of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect suddenly spoke up.

“Elder, please go ahead,” Chu Feng said.

“We have been through many difficult situations so far, and I earnestly view you as a friend and an ally, so I will speak very frankly to you.

“The Holy Light Clan might have organized this tournament with the intent to nurture those of the younger generation, but as the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy, do you think that they would tolerate the presence of any juniors who outshine those of their own clan?

“Young friend Chu Feng, if you were to reveal your true strength before them, there’s no saying what kind of attitude they would take toward you. It would be great news if they value your talent, but if they were to view you as a threat instead, that could lead to a catastrophic outcome,” Elder Gongsun voiced out his worries.

“Hahaha...”

But hearing those words, the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster burst into laughter.

“That elder over there, I must say that your worry is truly unfounded. The Holy Light Clan does wield great power in our Holy Light Galaxy, but our young friend Chu Feng is no pushover either. Putting aside his relationship with Princess Miaomiao of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, didn’t you mention that he’s also on good terms with the Lady of Dao Sea?

“If the Holy Light Clan were to know of young friend Chu Feng’s connections, they will surely be desperate to get on good terms with him. Unless they are out of their minds, they won’t dare to lay a single finger on young friend Chu Feng!”

The words spoken by the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster was incredibly arrogant, but no one amidst the crowd refuted his words. They also felt that there was nothing the Holy Light Clan could do about Chu Feng given the connections he had.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng simply smiled lightly in response.

He had never expected Xian Miaomiao to back him up, and he had no intention of relying on her either.

As for the Lady of Dao Sea, they were just temporary partners whose interests were aligned for a period of time. There was no way she would stand against the Holy Light Clan for him.

“Alright, everyone. Since this place isn’t safe, it would be best for us to leave this place first. We can talk along the way,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Farewell, elders,” Chu Feng clasped his fist toward and bade farewell to the crowd.

“Young friend Chu Feng, aren’t you going to return with us?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked Chu Feng concernedly.

The attitude that the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief took toward Chu Feng had changed greatly over time. At the very start, he was very reluctant to see how close Long Xiaoxiao was getting to Chu Feng. The only reason why he kept quiet on the matter all this while was because he didn’t want to risk fracturing his relationship with Long Xiaoxiao further.

But right now, if he could, he would like more than anything to bring Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao together through an engagement. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He felt that only the geniuses of the Holy Light Galaxy, only Chu Feng was worthy of his daughter, And if one were to look at it in terms of connections and character, Chu Feng was definitely the better choice of the two.

“I have a friend in the Nine Souls Galaxy. I’m intending to pay him a visit,” Chu Feng said.

“Little benefactor, allow me to accompany you,” Long Xiaoxiao immediately spoke up.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, this friend of mine has an eccentric personality. It would be best for me to meet him alone,” Chu Feng replied.

“Then I’ll wait elsewhere for you. We can head back to the Holy Light Galaxy together once you’re done,” Long Xiaoxiao said.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, that really won’t do.”

Chu Feng shook his head, expressing strongly that he couldn’t bring Long Xiaoxiao together with him this time around.

“Xiaoxiao, don’t trouble young friend Chu Feng too much,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief interjected.

Faced with Chu Feng’s objection, there was nothing else Long Xiaoxiao could do. Even though she felt a little disappointed due to this, she didn’t let it show on her face. Instead, she obediently told Chu Feng that she would be waiting for him in the Holy Light Galaxy.

The crowd then parted ways. The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the others began making their way back to the Holy Light Galaxy.

As for Chu Feng... he didn’t head away to meet the so-called friend he mentioned. He had no friends at all in the Nine Souls Galaxy other than Xian Miaomiao.

It was just that he was desperate to raise his cultivation quickly, so he didn’t want to miss the opportunity provided by the Whitesky Star River.

However, he also knew that if he were to tell the others that he intended to enter the Whitesky Star River, Long Xiaoxiao would adamantly insist on tagging along with him.

It was one thing if the place was safe, but if Long Xiaoxiao were to come to harm as a result of this matter, he would feel guilt-ridden.

As such, he lied to them, claiming that he was going to meet a friend.

After ensuring that everyone was gone, he turned around and headed back to the Whitesky Star River all alone.
