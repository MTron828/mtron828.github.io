Chapter 2452 - Life And Death Gamble

“Lord Father, this matter is unrelated to Chu Feng. We cannot let him die because of our Ancient Era’s War Clan.”

“That’s right. Father, please think of something.”

Seeing that Chu Feng was about to die, Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong both started to plead with their father.

As for the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief, he had a very complicated expression on his face. He wanted to say something, but then hesitated to do so. In the end, he did not say anything.

“Buzz~~~”

However, the very next moment, the Ancient Era’s War Sword suddenly moved. It turned into a dazzling golden ray that shot toward Chu Feng.

At that moment, everyone felt that Chu Feng was going to die. After all, the might of the Ancient Era’s War Sword was too frightening.

However, after the golden ray enveloped Chu Feng, they were shocked to discover that Chu Feng had not died, that they were still able to sense Chu Feng’s aura.

“What’s going on?” The Ancient Era’s War Clansmen all revealed puzzled expressions.

“It didn’t kill you, have you succeeded?” Her Lady Queen was pleasantly surprised.

“I’m afraid that I haven’t succeeded yet. The killing intent is still enveloping me,” Compared to Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng was much more calm. It was as if he had already seen through life and death.

In fact, it was not that he had seen through life and death. Rather, he knew very well that his life and death was not up to him to decide at the moment.

Besides, Chu Feng was quite confident in his guess. Even though the conclusion had not yet been reached, he still felt that he should be able to survive.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, the golden ray started to shrink and shrouded Chu Feng’s entire body.

It had covered Chu Feng like golden armor.

At that moment, Chu Feng was emitting light even more dazzling than that of the sun.

“That is?” The Ancient Era’s War Clansmen grew even more puzzled.

“Chu Feng, I am fond of someone loyal and affectionate like you.”

“Today, I will give you a chance. I will set up a formation. There are nine hundred million nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine swords in the formation.”

“Among them is a Life Sword and a Death Sword.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The Death Sword will continue to chase after you to kill you. Its speed will gradually increase. As long as it catches up to you, you will undoubtedly be killed.”

“Thus, you must capture the Life Sword before the Death Sword catches up to you,” The Ancient Era’s War Sword said.

“What the hell! To find a Life Sword among nine hundred million nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine swords?!”

“The chance for survival is simply too low, no?!” Her Lady Queen was furious.

As for the people from the Ancient Era’s War Clan, they too shook their heads in succession.

Although the Ancient Era’s War Sword had indeed given Chu Feng an opportunity to live, they all felt that his chance of survival was simply too small.

However, when the next sentence was spoken by the Ancient Era’s War Sword, everyone was greatly shocked.

“If you are capable of capturing the Life Sword, I will be yours to use,” The Ancient Era’s War Sword said.

“What?” Hearing those words, the expressions of the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen changed enormously.

The Ancient Era’s War Sword was their Ancient Era’s War Clan’s strongest secret skill.

Throughout the many years, there had never been anyone capable of awakening it. And now, Chu Feng actually managed to receive an opportunity to obtain it.

At that moment, many of the people from the Ancient Era’s War Clan no longer looked to Chu Feng with gazes of sympathy. Rather, their sympathy was replaced with slight admiration and jealousy.

Although the trial was extremely terrifying, Chu Feng would be able to obtain the Ancient Era’s War Sword, that extremely powerful secret skill, in addition to being able to survive if he passed the trial. When thinking about it, those Ancient Era’s War Clansmen felt the trial to be simply something that one could only wish for.

If it were them who were given that trial, they too might brave the risk to attempt it.

“Chu Feng, have you made your preparations?” The Ancient Era’s War Sword asked.

“Senior, I’m ready,” Chu Feng said.

“Buzz~~~”

The very next moment, Chu Feng felt that the scene before him was rapidly changing, and that his body was sinking nonstop. It was as if he was falling into a bottomless pit.

When everything returned to normal, Chu Feng discovered that he had arrived at a vast and boundless space.

In that space, his surroundings and the area above his head were pitch black. However, dazzling golden light shone from underneath Chu Feng’s feet.

Golden swords were standing below him. Each and every one of them was over three meters tall.

They were arranged below him in a densely packed manner. Their numbers were so numerous that they formed a sea of swords.

“This is quite difficult,” Chu Feng revealed a difficult expression.

He was surprised to discover that all of the golden swords looked the same as the Ancient Era’s War Sword.

In other words, the nine hundred million nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine swords all had the same appearance.

Most importantly, Chu Feng’s Heaven’s Eyes were ineffective here. In fact, he was unable to use even his spirit power, as well as his various perceptive abilities.

The only thing Chu Feng was capable of using were his most primitive perceptive abilities.

However, with this, how could he find the so-called Life Sword from all these swords?

“Clank~~~”

Right at that moment, a dazzling sound was heard from behind Chu Feng.

Chu Feng turned around, and discovered that a golden sword had appeared behind him. It was rushing toward him with an extremely fast speed.

It was also an Ancient Era’s War Sword. Merely, that Ancient Era’s War Sword emitted an absolute killing sensation and power capable of obliterating Chu Feng.

Without a doubt, Chu Feng’s body would explode on the spot, killing him, if he were to be struck by the sword.

“Zzzz~~~”

At that moment, how could Chu Feng dare to show any negligence? He immediately unleashed his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings as he started fleeing from the sword.

After Chu Feng’s cultivation reached its peak, he unleashed the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique to assist in his escape.

In fact, Chu Feng also took out his Magma Emperor Sword. He was borrowing the power of the Incomplete Ancestral Armament to increase his speed.

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng was surprised to discover that the Death Sword behind him was still rapidly gaining on him.

The difference in strength between them was too great. Chu Feng was simply unable to escape from the sword.

“Isn’t this utter nonsense?! With how fast that Death Sword is, how could you possibly escape it?”

“That Ancient Era’s War Sword simply never planned to give you the opportunity to search for the Life Sword. You will soon be caught up to and killed by the Death Sword.”

“This is simply a scam. It was simply toying you,” Her Lady Queen was both panicky and furious. She restlessly began to walk back and forth in the world spirit space. In fact, sparkling radiance actually emerged in her furious eyes.

Her Lady Queen felt that the speed of the Death Sword was simply too fast. Not to mention finding a Life Sword from nine hundred million nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine swords, she felt that the task would be impossible to accomplish even if there were only nine hundred swords because there simply wasn’t a sufficient amount of time.

“Chu Feng, what should we do? You can’t just die like this.”

“That’s right, the Evil God Sword! Quickly, use the Evil God Sword! You will have a chance of survival if you are to use the Evil God Sword!” Her Lady Queen shouted.

“Evil God Sword?” At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart moved.

Indeed, in a situation like this, his own strength was practically useless.

However, the power the Evil God Sword contained was inestimable. If he were to use the Evil God Sword, then perhaps he would really have the opportunity to survive.

“No, I can’t,” However, in the end, Chu Feng shook his head. He said, “Since this is a trial, I must rely on myself. If I am to use the Evil God Sword, even if I am to succeed, this trial will have lost all meaning.”

“Have you gone stupid? Look at the situation, is it still time to consider something like that?”

“Stop hesitating. Quickly, use the Evil God Sword. Although the Evil God Sword is very dangerous, you will still have a chance of survival if you are to use it,” Her Lady Queen said.

“No, I must rely on myself this time around,” However, Chu Feng was determined to not use the Evil God Sword.

“Step~~~”

Furthermore, as he spoke those words, Chu Feng actually released the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique under his feet and stopped in midair.

Chu Feng had actually stopped fleeing, and stood where he was without moving.
