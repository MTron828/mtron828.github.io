Chapter 2398 - Voice of the Guest Overwhelms That of the Host

“B-but, he c-clearly knows that you’re a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor, whereas he’s a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor. Isn’t his i-intention t-to bully you obvious?” Wang Qiang said.

“That is why he is someone who only dares to bully the weak and fears the strong. I have encountered a lot of people like him. It’s fine, we can have him act arrogant for a bit longer. I have my ways of taking care of him,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

At that moment, Wang Qiang was slightly startled.

Those members of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s younger generation had clearly come to look for trouble. The words they said were very rude and offensive. If it was someone else that was treated in such a manner, even if they managed to not become angry, their expressions would definitely turn ugly.

However, not only was Chu Feng not angry, he also had a smile on his face. He had an appearance as if he was a spectator watching a very good show.

This caused Wang Qiang to become curious too. He was very curious as to how Chu Feng, who clearly possessed a cultivation inferior to that Kong Ruozeng, planned to take care of Kong Ruozeng.

Thinking of it, Wang Qiang revealed a smile. Like a spectator, he looked outward.

“Brother Ruozeng, don’t bother shouting anymore. Chu Feng and Wang Qiang are our Kong Heavenly Clan’s honored guests. Even Lord Utmost Exalted Elder treated Chu Feng with respect. If you are to continue to act like this, you will anger Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, and will most likely suffer punishments,” Kong Zheng continued to urge Kong Ruozeng against it.

However, that Kong Ruozeng simply ignored Kong Zheng. He continued, “Chu Feng, do you fucking dare to accept my challenge or not?! Could it be that you are nothing more than a coward?!”

Seeing that Chu Feng had not been answering him the entire time, Kong Ruozeng grew more and more pleased with himself. He turned to Kong Zheng and said, “Kong Zheng, look at this. That Chu Feng is only someone that only dares to bully the weak and fears the strong. Is this your so-called genius? Grandmaster Kai Hong’s successor? The way I see it, he is nothing more than cowardly trash.”

“Hahahaha...” After he finished saying those words, he burst into loud laughter.

“Sure enough, what big brother Ruozeng said is correct, that Chu Feng is nothing more than a coward that only dares to bully the weak and fears the strong. Although he might appear to be very exceptional when bullying Kong Zheng, he turned into an utter coward before big brother Ruozeng. Hahahaha...”

At that moment, the people of the younger generation that had arrived with Kong Ruozeng all began to feel that Chu Feng would not dare to come out. One by one, they all burst into loud and mocking laughter.

“Who said that I, Chu Feng, does not dare accept the challenge?”

However, right at that moment, the tightly closed palace’s entrance gate suddenly opened.

At that moment, the group of Kong Heavenly Clan’s younger generation that were previously laughing mockingly all went silent.

Everyone turned their gazes to the entrance gate. In fact, some among them even grew afraid, and moved to hide behind Kong Ruozeng.

From this, it could be seen that not all of those fellows were courageous individuals; many of them were merely people that had come to take advantage of Kong Ruozeng’s strength to bully Chu Feng. Even though they were displeased with Chu Feng, they only dared to come humiliate him by borrowing the strength of another.

Before the fixed gazes of the crowd, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang walked out from the palace.

Chu Feng had not hidden his cultivation. Thus, when they sensed Chu Feng’s cultivation of rank seven Half Martial Ancestor, they revealed relaxed smiles. Those fellows were truly the epitome of bullying the weak and fearing the strong.

“Chu Feng, I had thought that you wouldn’t dare to come out,” Kong Ruozeng said to Chu Feng.

“Why wouldn’t I dare to come out?” Chu Feng asked.

“Very well. Since you’ve dared to come out, you must’ve made preparations to fight against me, right?” Kong Ruozeng asked.

“Of course. Let’s start now,” Chu Feng said.

Hearing what Chu Feng said, the people of the younger generation from the Kong Heavenly Clan all revealed surprised expressions. They did not expect that Chu Feng would actually really dare to accept the challenge.

However, at the same time, they revealed mocking smiles on their faces. At that moment, they felt as if they were able to see the scene of Chu Feng being trampled upon by Kong Ruozeng.

Furthermore, upon thinking about how such a scene would soon emerge before them, they became endlessly excited and itching to see that scene.

After all, the person that would be trampled upon was the renowned genius, Grandmaster Kai Hong’s successor.

The person that was the happiest at that moment was none other than Kong Ruozeng. He was so overjoyed by Chu Feng’s appearance that he was nearly blooming with delight. With a loud voice, he said, “Very well. Frank and straightforward, I like it. Since that’s the case, don’t blame me for being impolite.”

As Kong Ruozeng spoke, he pulled up his sleeves and revealed his rank nine Half Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might. He was prepared to ruthlessly trample on Chu Feng.

“Woosh~~~”

However, right at that moment, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and a layer of magnificent spirit power flew out from his sleeve. The spirit power overlaid itself in multiple layers which interweaved with one another. Soon, a spirit formation wall was formed. That wall stood right before Chu Feng.

“Ssss~~~”

Seeing this scene, even those people that were filled with hostility toward Chu Feng were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were extremely rare. Even they, children from a noble family, very rarely saw Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. And now, a fellow member of the younger generation was actually an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Although they greatly detested Chu Feng in their hearts, they still felt themselves to be inferior the moment they saw that Chu Feng was actually really an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

“What are you doing?” Upon seeing that spirit formation wall, Kong Ruozeng revealed a puzzled expression.

“Since you’ve come to find me to spar, you must’ve come to spar with me with world spirit techniques. As such, I naturally will have to satisfy your request. As per your desire, I have finished setting up my spirit formation. Go ahead and attempt to break it. As long as you are able to break my spirit formation wall using world spirit techniques, it would be considered your win,” Chu Feng said.

“What? Spar with world spirit techniques? W-who said I want...” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Kong Ruozeng’s expression changed enormously.

However, before he could finish his sentence, Chu Feng interrupted, “Oh, that’s right. Don’t say that I’m bullying you. Although I casually set up this spirit formation of mine, I will not put a restriction on how long it will take you to break it with world spirit techniques. Regardless of how much time you spend, it will be your victory as long as you can undo it. Even if you are to spend your entire life to undo my spirit formation, it will still be your win.”

“You!!!” Kong Ruozeng was so furious that his face turned pale.

In fact, it was not only Kong Ruozeng; the others from the Kong Heavenly Clan were all stunned as well. None of them expected Chu Feng to do something like this.

Although Kong Ruozeng was also a world spiritist, he did not possess any gifts in the realm of world spirit techniques. Thus, even though he had devoted many years to mastering world spirit techniques, he was still only a Gold-cloak World Spiritist right now.

When compared to other people of his same generation, his attainments of being a Gold-cloak World Spiritist was actually quite decent.

However, if compared to Chu Feng, a grand Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, they would simply be light-years apart.

If Chu Feng was the heavens, then he would be the earth.

Not to mention this life, with the attainments Kong Ruozeng had in world spirit techniques, even if he were to spend his next life and the life after that, he would likely still be unable to undo Chu Feng’s world spirit formation.

‘The voice o-of the guest o-overwhelms that of the h-host. G-great job!’ Wang Qiang praised Chu Feng in his heart.

Wang Qiang had already realized what Chu Feng’s intention was. Although Kong Ruozeng had come to provoke Chu Feng, he did not clearly state that he wanted to compete with Chu Feng through battle power.

And now, Chu Feng had used world spirit techniques first. Thus, this Kong Ruozeng would definitely be no match. With that, even if the two of them were to compete in terms of battle power, and Chu Feng was to lose to Kong Ruozeng, they would only end up in a tie.

However, Wang Qiang felt that Chu Feng would not give Kong Ruozeng the opportunity to win. Thus, he was looking forward to what Chu Feng would be doing next.

“Who said that I wanted to compete with you in terms of world spirit techniques?!” Sure enough, Kong Ruozeng shouted angrily. He immediately rejected Chu Feng’s intention to compete with world spirit techniques.

“Oh? So you didn’t come to compete with me in terms of world spirit techniques? Then, what did you want to compete in? You couldn’t possibly be planning to say that you want to compete with me in terms of battle power, right?”

“You’re a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor, whereas I am a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor. You have cultivated for over eighty years, decades more than me. If you were to demand to compete with me in terms of battle power, wouldn’t that be too shameless of an action? After all, that would clearly be the strong bullying the weak. If word of that matter were to spread, you would be looked down on by others. I think that you, a grand young master of the Kong Heavenly Clan, would not be that shameless, right?” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

“......”

At that moment, not to mention the others, even Kong Ruozeng was left speechless.

He was only thinking about the fact that he possessed stronger strength than Chu Feng, and could use his strength to teach Chu Feng a lesson.

Never had he thought that Chu Feng would say that he was shameless by bullying the weak. Thus, if he were to continue to force Chu Feng to compete in terms of battle power, he would have fallen into Chu Feng’s trap.

At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s younger generation looked at one another in dismay. They had no idea what to do.
