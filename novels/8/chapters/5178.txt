Chapter 5178: Chu Feng Makes a Move

The two masters didn’t feel the slightest twinge on their conscience toward the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster. Instead, their eyes turned colder.

“You’re too noisy. I’ll start off by severing your tongue.”

Shoosh!

One of the spirit formation swords surrounding the Nameless Sect flew down and swiped at the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster.

Psssh!

Fresh blood splattered everywhere. The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster howled in agony.

It wasn’t just his tongue that had been severed. His entire mouth had been sliced off from his face.

Chu Feng could have prevented that from happening, but he chose not to intervene. He thought that the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster was deserving of punishment.

But the following action of the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster made him shake his head.

The Nameless Sect’s sectmaster kneeled on the floor and kowtowed to young master Wolf, the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster, and the others.

“Young master Wolf, Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster, please spare me. I’ll write a contract right now to forfeit our rights to the ancient remnant’s Exalted Stones!”

As long as their souls remained intact, cultivators of his level were still capable of vocalizing even after their mouths had been sliced off.

His plea for mercy only invited derisory laughter from young master Wolf and the others. Some of them even guffawed.

How could they spare the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster after all that had happened?

“Continue,” young master Wolf said.

The two masters prepared their next move.

“W-wait a moment! Our Nameless Sect has a forbidden land that contains a huge secret! I can bring you in right now!” the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster exclaimed in a fluster.

“Stop.”

The Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster issued an order before turning his eyes to the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster.

“You’re saying that it’s possible to enter that forbidden land? How? If you dare lie to me, I’ll make sure that you die the most painful death ever,” the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster threatened.

“I-it’s her! She has a special constitution that allows her to enter the forbidden land!” the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster exclaimed as he pointed a finger at Yue Ling.

A look of disbelief showed on Yue Ling and her master’s face. They would have never imagined that the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster would be so despicable as to betray Yue Ling. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Nine Levels Pavilion knew about their forbidden land, and they would resort to all means to secure it. If they knew that Yue Ling was able to freely access it, they would surely do inhumane things to her in order to guarantee their access.

She would face a fate worse than death.

Chu Feng also understood the implications here. The gaze he directed at the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster turned cold.

“Her?”

The Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster looked at Yue Ling in skepticism. It was hard to believe that a young lady was able to enter the forbidden land when none of the Nameless Sect’s predecessors had been able to do so.

“I’m not lying to you! Just come with me to our Nameless Sect. I’ll show it to…”

Pu!

Blood gushed out from the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster before he could complete his sentence. A spirit formation sword had plunged into his head, crushing the soul of the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster. He wasn’t dead yet, but he had been rendered incapable of speech.

The sword came from none other than Chu Feng.

“Who allowed you to make a move?” the Nine Levels Pavilion’s sectmaster roared.

He was weaker than the two masters, but he had been emboldened by the backing of young master Wolf. He was also very curious to know about the forbidden land’s secret, so he couldn’t allow the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster to die yet.

“It isn’t us!” the two masters hurriedly explained.

“It isn’t you? Are you saying that it’s us?”

There was no way those from the Nine Levels Pavilion would believe their words. The encirclement of swords came from those two masters, and it was a sword that pierced the head of the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster. Who else could the culprit be other than them?

“It’s not them. I was the one who did it,” Chu Feng said.

“It’s you?”

The two masters immediately recognized the voice to be the helper Yue Ling brought over. Shock could be seen on their faces.

They thought that Chu Feng was a nobody unworthy of their time, but he was actually able to launch such an attack without them noticing. This showed that Chu Feng was no pushover.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

While they were still coming to terms with the situation, numerous more spirit formation swords flew straight for the two masters. By the time the crowd realized it, the two masters already had multiple swords plunged inside their bodies, reminiscent of a porcupine.

Gah!

The two of them screamed in agony just like the Nameless Sect’s sectmaster.

Both Yue Ling and her master widened their eyes. They thought that Chu Feng had already left, but he was still present at the scene and even curbed the two masters with ease.

In his strength, they saw a light of hope out of this despairing situation.

“Oh? There’s another expert hiding here? Are you intending to interfere in this matter too?” young master Wolf asked.

His voice remained perfectly composed despite having witnessed Chu Feng’s strength.

“I didn’t want to interfere in this matter, but I can’t turn a blind eye to this anymore after you have disrespected my friend. How about this? You slice off your little brother and apologize to my friend, and I’ll consider sparing your life,” Chu Feng said.

Young master Wolf’s complexion darkened.

“You’re courting death!”

He thrust his palm upward, manifesting a golden tiger with his martial power that charged straight at Chu Feng.

Whoosh!

Before the golden tiger manifested out of martial power could come close to Chu Feng, an identical one manifested and charged against it. The two golden tigers clashed head-on with each other, and the one manifested by young master Wolf immediately dissipated into thin air.

“This!”

Everyone was stunned by what they had seen.

Chu Feng’s golden tiger was manifested out of spirit power, but its might far surpassed that of ordinary rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivators.

“Shit!”

Young master Wolf activated his bloodline ability. His eyes turned blood-red and his body emanated a blue aura. At the same time, his cultivation went up by a rank.

Uwah!

Before the blue aura could reveal its true might, young master Wolf suddenly let out a pained cry. It was not that Chu Feng’s spirit power tiger had attacked him. On the contrary, it was prowling around him as if it had a life of its own.

What made young master Wolf cry out was Chu Feng’s spirit power binding his body.

That was how strong Chu Feng was.

His spirit power was at rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation, comparable to rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivators. With the further enhancements from the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and his world spiritist bloodline, he was able to rival enemies two cultivation ranks stronger than him.

It wasn’t enough to him to break into Half-God level, but ordinary rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivators wouldn’t stand a chance against him

Young master Wolf might have been able to put up a fight considering how he possessed the means to raise his fighting prowess too, but he got conceited and didn’t utilize them right away.

Naturally, Chu Feng wouldn’t give him a chance to do so.

As a result, this fight was already over before anything could happen.
