Chapter 3025 - Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector

“Lord Youyuan, exactly what sort of origin do the Bandit Beasts possess?” Overwhelmed with joy, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, and began to inquire as to the origin of the Bandit Beasts. After all, judging from Chu Youyuan’s tone, the Bandit Beasts seemed to be very remarkable.

“The Bandit Beasts could be said to be an unconventional race of monstrous beasts. They have been living in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for even longer than our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“The reason why I said they’re unconventional is because they’re not a benevolent race. What they are most fond of doing is not the pursuit of martial cultivation. Instead, it is robbery, pillaging and murder.”

“It is precisely because of their bandit-like behavior that they are known as the Bandit Beasts.”

Hearing till this point, Chu Feng finally realized why Chu Youyuan told him to kill them from the very start. It turned out that the Bandit Beasts possessed a very vile nature. For their own selfish desires, they would kill, pillage and commit all sorts of unimaginable crimes.

Their behavior was simply no different from demonic sects. Indeed, they should be killed and eliminated.

“That said, while the Bandit Beasts possess a very vile nature, they have accumulated a lot of treasures over the years. Reportedly, the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector that is capable of allowing Heavenly Immortal users to utilize Immortal Armaments is among the treasures they possess,” Chu Youyuan said.

“Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector?” Chu Feng’s expression changed.

“The Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector is said to be something created by a peak Exalted-level expert.”

“As everyone knows, Immortal Armaments are very powerful and hard to control. However, if one is to wear the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector, even Heavenly Immortal-level experts would be able to use Immortal Armaments,” Chu Youyuan said.

“In that case, that Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector is truly a treasure,” Chu Feng knew very well that the power of martial cultivators would always be restricted by their cultivation. Treasures capable of unlocking this sort of restriction could all be considered to be very valuable treasures.

As for that Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector, it was evidently one such highly valuable treasure.

“It is naturally a treasure. Immortal Armaments are extremely powerful. Even for Martial Immortals, Immortal Armaments are indispensable treasures for increasing their battle power. However, if a Heavenly Immortal is to be able to use Immortal Armaments, do you know how frightening the power of that Immortal Armament would be?” Chu Youyuan asked.

“Lord Youyuan, please educate me,” Chu Feng said.

“If a Heavenly Immortal expert is capable of using Immortal Armaments, the power of that Immortal Armament would not only increase that Heavenly Immortal’s battle power. Instead, the Immortal Armament would directly confer a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation,” Chu Youyuan said.

“Heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. However... that is only the case should a Heavenly Immortal-level expert use an Immortal Armament.”

“If a Martial Immortal-level expert were to use an Immortal Armament, they would not gain that heaven-defying battle power,” Chu Youyuan said.

Chu Feng was able to understand why that was the case.

It was due to the fact that Immortal Armaments were so powerful that Heavenly Immortals could not use them. However, should they be able to use one, it would be quite normal for the Immortal Armament to unleash a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation when used in the hands of a Heavenly Immortal.

After all, Immortal Armaments were originally things that didn’t belong to Heavenly Immortals. Immortal Armaments were normally weapons that only Martial Immortals could control.

Should a Martial Immortal’s weapon be used by a Heavenly Immortal, it would instead be unreasonable if it didn’t unleash some sort of power that far surpassed that of Incomplete Immortal Armaments.

“The Bandit Beasts have been in existence for so long, I’m afraid they’re not so easy to handle, no?” Chu Feng asked.

The reason Chu Feng asked that question was because he was already tempted by the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector. After all, Chu Feng was a Heavenly Immortal now, and also possessed Immortal Armaments that he was unable to use.

However, if he were to obtain the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector, he would solve the issue of being unable to use his Immortal Armaments. For Chu Feng, that would be akin to a tiger growing wings.

However, according to Chu Youyuan, the Bandit Beasts were evidently not so easy to handle. Even though the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector might be in their possession, it would likely be very difficult to obtain it.

“Reportedly, the Bandit Beasts are not very strong. Even their clan chief is only someone who has just stepped into the Heavenly Immortal realm. As such, they will generally only dare to bully and humiliate cultivators in the True Immortal realm or lower,” Chu Youyuan said.

“They’re actually so weak? In that case, Lord Youyuan, how have they been able to survive in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for so long?” Chu Feng was surprised. If the Bandit Beasts were so weak, they should’ve been eradicated by other powers long ago.

After all, if their chief was only at the early Heavenly Immortal realm, there would be a lot of people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that would be able to easily take care of them.

“The most amazing aspect of the Bandit Beasts would be their mobile base. Their base is capable of concealing itself. When it is concealed, not even ordinary Exalted-level experts will be able to find it.”

“Moreover, the Bandit Beasts do not possess a normal manner of activity. Thus, it is very difficult to find them,” Chu Youyuan said.

“They’ve worked their evil for so long, how could they not encounter people that are capable of taking care of them?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng felt that the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was a place with hidden dragons and crouching tigers. With the Bandit Beasts plundering people all these years, they should have encountered experts before.

With their strength, they would definitely end up suffering should they encounter an expert.

“That has naturally happened before. However, while the Bandit Beasts are very greedy, they are also very united. Even in death, they will not expose their hideout. Furthermore, they possess a sort of power within themselves capable of shattering their own souls. Thus, whenever they are captured by others, they will immediately commit suicide through self-detonation.”

“Thus, it is useless even if one were to capture them. After all, one would not even have the opportunity to torture them, much less interrogate them into giving out the location of their lair,” Chu Youyuan said.

“What about following them from the shadows?” Chu Feng asked.

“That is most likely the only feasible method. However, it’s not that simple either. The reason for that is because the Bandit Beasts are extremely prudent, possessing a special perceptive ability, and will immediately conceal themselves when they approach their lair.”

“In short, encountering them is a fortunate opportunity. However, the question of obtaining actual treasures will depend on whether or not one can actually reach their lair.”

“Thus, you must pretend to be weak later. You must allow yourself to be captured by them like a slave. Even if they beat you up, you must still endure it. The reason for that is because they will only let down their guard toward people that they’ve subdued,” Chu Youyuan said.

“This junior understands,” Chu Feng nodded. He understood Chu Youyuan’s intention.

Then, he looked to the middle-aged man before him. He asked, “Excuse me, how shall I address you?”

“Lord Benefactor, I am called Luo Dali. You can address me as Dali,” the middle-aged man answered with reverence.

“Actually, you’re not that much older than me. I’ll just address you as Brother Luo,” Chu Feng said.

“Eh... this... if Lord Benefactor is fond of that,” Luo Dali scratched his head awkwardly. Even though he had lived for over a thousand years, his wisdom resembled that of a child.

“Brother Luo, you said earlier that your family was captured by those monstrous beasts?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, Lord Benefactor. My entire family, old and young, were all captured by those monstrous beasts. I escaped by myself to find people to save them. Fortunately, I ran into Lord Benefactor. Otherwise, I truly would not know what to do.”

This man by the name of Luo Dali had a very grateful expression on his face as he spoke to Chu Feng. It would appear that he was someone who knew how to repay the kindness he had received.

“Brother Luo, remember this. I will definitely save your family. However, I need you to cooperate with me,” Chu Feng said. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Of course, of course. Lord Benefactor, please go ahead and tell me what you need me to do. I will definitely cooperate with you,” Luo Dali nodded his head repeatedly. It seemed that he will agree to whatever Chu Feng wanted him to do.

“Due to certain reasons, I cannot save them immediately. However, you can rest assured that I will definitely save them,” Chu Feng said.

“Ah? Lord Benefactor, could it be that you’ve got something that you need to take care of, and have to leave now?” Hearing those words, panic covered Luo Dali’s face.

He thought that Chu Feng was planning to leave, and not immediately save his family.
