Chapter 3738 - The Furious Gu Mingyuan

“Bastard! Fight back! Why are you dodging?!”

Seeing that her attacks were unable to cause any harm to Linghu Hongfei, Chu Lingxi became increasingly furious.

She felt that she was being humiliated by him.

She was debating whether she should increase her cultivation to defeat Linghu Hongfei or not.

That said, she was slightly hesitant. After all, Linghu Hongfei also possessed the ability to increase his cultivation.

“Clank~~~”

At the moment when she was still pondering, the Incomplete Exalted Armament in Chu Lingxi’s hand suddenly became unmovable.

Looking towards her Incomplete Exalted Armament, Chu Lingxi’s expression changed enormously.

She was astonished to discover that the Incomplete Exalted Armament in her hand had been fixed in place by Linghu Hongfei using two fingers.

Upon discovering this, an enormously powerful oppressive might was released from Linghu Hongfei’s body. Like a tsunami, it engulfed Chu Lingxi.

That was... the oppressive might of a rank five Exalted!!!

The rank five Exalted-level oppressive might engulfed Chu Lingxi the instant it was released.

“How could this be?”

“How could this guy’s oppressive might be so strange?”

At that moment, Chu Lingxi’s expression changed enormously.

She discovered that she was not only engulfed by Linghu Hongfei’s oppressive might, but she was completely sealed by that oppressive might, much akin to being trapped in a cage.

Not to mention her treasure capable of increasing her cultivation, Chu Lingxi was unable to even use her Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor.

Linghu Hongfei’s oppressive might was extremely strange, as it was capable of completely suppressing Chu Lingxi, making her unable to activate the other powers she possessed.

He was simply denying Chu Lingxi even the ability to turn the situation around.

As for what brought Chu Lingxi the greatest unease, it was how Linghu Hongfei had clearly increased his cultivation to rank five Exalted, but there was no trace of change on Linghu Hongfei’s body.

This meant that he had not used any special abilities to increase his cultivation.

Instead, his actual cultivation was that of a rank five Exalted.

“Bastard, you actually concealed your cultivation?!”

Fury was surging in Chu Lingxi’s eyes as she looked to the current Linghu Hongfei. She was feeling increasingly unwell.

She had realized that Linghu Hongfei had not been going all-out when she had fought him previously.

Merely, she did not anticipate that he had concealed his cultivation so much.

This made it so that Chu Lingxi had no choice but to recognize the disparity between herself and Linghu Hongfei.

Not only would she be defeated, but she was also destined to be defeated very miserably.

As for Linghu Hongfei, he was also thinking that victory was within his grasp.

He was so confident that he actually did not bother to even look at Chu Lingxi. Instead, he turned his gaze to the Chu Heavenly Clan. “Chu Feng, if you don’t come out, this girl’s eyes shall be destroyed again.”

“What? Linghu Hongfei is planning to dig out Chu Lingxi’s eyes again?”

Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen and even the bystanders all felt their hearts grow tense.

It was merely a challenge. His opponent had lost. With that, shouldn’t one stop? Why must one be so cruel as to dig out their opponent’s eyes?

However, Linghu Hongfei simply did not care about what the bystanders were thinking. He turned to the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan and shouted loudly, “Chu Feng, as a man, are you really planning to have a woman shield you twice?!”

“Your opponent is me!!!”

Chu Lingxi shouted furiously. At the same time, her body began to tremble as an overwhelming aura gathered within her.

Chu Lingxi was trying her hardest to activate her Lightning Mark or Lightning Armor to increase her cultivation.

Unfortunately, Linghu Hongfei’s oppressive might was simply too strange. Even though his oppressive might had only engulfed her, she was unable to utilize any of her powers.

All of them were sealed.

She was being completely suppressed.

“Chu Lingxi, it’s useless.”

“You are simply no match for me. No matter how much you struggle, you will not be able to change that fact.”

“Taking into consideration that you’re a woman, I will give you a chance today.”

“Kneel before me and admit your wrong and I, Linghu Hongfei, will spare you,” Linghu Hongfei said to Chu Lingxi.

“Someone is indeed going to kneel and beg for forgiveness today. However, that person is not Chu Lingxi. Instead, it’s you, Linghu Hongfei!”

Right at that moment, a furious shout exploded in the sky.

Following that, a figure walked out of the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Seeing that person, the expressions of the crowd all changed. Even the experts from the Linghu Heavenly Clan were alerted upon seeing that person.

The reason for that was because that person was someone that very few people in the Ancestral Martial Starfield would dare to look down on.

She was Chu Lingxi’s mother, the princess of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, Gu Mingyuan.

“I’d nearly forgotten that Chu Lingxi is no ordinary person of the younger generation. She is also someone who possesses an enormous background.”

After Gu Mingyuan appeared, a trace of expectation appeared in the eyes of the bystanders.

After all, Gu MIngyuan was a very influential person.

Reportedly, even the Starfield Master Realm of the past would have to give her face.

Because of this, they wanted to know if the situation would change now that Gu Mingyuan had appeared.

“Woosh~~~”

However, right after Gu Mingyuan appeared, two aged individuals immediately blocked her way.

After those two people appeared, the surrounding air became very complicated.

The reason for that was because those two individuals were both rank one Utmost Exalted.

They were the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders, Linghu Wentai and Linghu Boyuan.

“Gu Mingyuan, this is a sparring match between people of the younger generations, you shouldn’t interfere in this, no?” Linghu Boyuan said to Gu Mingyuan.

His attitude was very rude. His tone was filled with threat. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After hearing those words, the crowd realized that the Linghu Heavenly Clan was not planning to give Gu Mingyuan face.

With the situation being like that, the crowd began to sympathize with Gu Mingyuan.

After all, no matter how powerful she might be, she was still only a rank one Utmost Exalted.

Whilst her cultivation was extremely powerful and top-rated in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, there were plenty of people in the Linghu Heavenly Clan that could contend against her.

“Scram!”

To everyone’s surprise, Gu Mingyuan coldly shouted down Linghu Boyuan’s threat.

Gu Mingyuan’s reaction shocked both the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen and the bystanders.

To publicly shout at a Supreme Elder of the Linghu Heavenly Clan would not only be disrespectful towards that Supreme Elder, but it would also be disrespectful towards the entire Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Sure enough, the expression of Linghu Wentai who stood before Gu Mingyuan turned gloomy. He said to Gu Mingyuan, “Gu Mingyuan, watch yourself!”

“In the past, the Wuming Clan was cowardly and easily bullied. They allowed your disrespectful behavior.”

“However, the Ancestral Martial Starfield is now under our Linghu Heavenly Clan’s control. You’d best curb your temper, otherwise...”

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, before Linghu Wentai could finish his words, he let out a scream.

When the crowd reacted to what had happened, they were astonished to discover that Linghu Wentai was sent flying.

But, Linghu Wentai clearly possessed the same rank one Utmost Exalted cultivation as Gu Mingyuan!!!
