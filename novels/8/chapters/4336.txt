Chapter 4336: The Strength of the Divine Beast

“Master, what’s going on? Why did the energy inside the golden ocean suddenly flow into Princess Xiaoxiao’s body? Wouldn’t this mean that the poisonous medicinal fluid has flowed into Princess Xiaoxiao’s body too?” Chu Feng immediately asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist anxiously.

“What are you talking about? Who in the world told you that the fluid inside the black bottle is poisonous? What I told you is that I’m going to help her while protecting us both. Do you not trust your master at all?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

Chu Feng still had no idea what was going on at the moment, but he knew what kind of person the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was. It was unlikely for him to lie to him.

Besides, it looked like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist knew what he was doing.

Given that there was nothing he could do in this situation either, he could only trust his master.

He couldn’t say for sure whether his master would try to sabotage others or not, but he was certain that his master would never try to harm him. And that was enough for him.

“Master, what should I do next?”

Since the Dragon Vein Source had yet to be opened, Chu Feng felt that there were other tasks that he needed to fulfill.

“The only job you have to do right now is to wait for Long Xiaoxiao to finish absorbing the energy from the Dragon Source Vein and bring her out,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

“Master, is the golden ocean really all of the energy that the Dragon Vein Source contains?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why ask unnecessary questions when you’re able to see with your own eyes?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied with a snort.

“Then master, all I have to do right now is just watch Princess Xiaoxiao like this?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, that’s right,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

“Master, it can’t be that you’re thinking of giving all of the energy in the Dragon Vein Source to Princess Xiaoxiao, are you? Doesn’t that mean that the other members of the Dragon Clan won’t be able to reap the benefits of the Dragon Vein Source?” Chu Feng asked.

He could already see through the intentions of his master.

However, that would mean that they were contravening what the Dragon Clan had requested of them.

That being said, Chu Feng wasn’t that worried about that at all. On the contrary, he welcomed this situation with a gleeful heart.

If all of the energy of the Dragon Vein Source were to enter Long Xiaoxiao’s body, that would make her value to the Dragon Clan on par with that of the Dragon Vein Source.

Her standing within the Dragon Clan would rise to an unimaginable level.

“That’s the only way we can ensure our safety,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

His response verified Chu Feng’s conjecture.

“So master, what you told me to put inside the Dragon Source Vein isn’t poison, but something to help Long Xiaoxiao assimilate the energy of the Dragon Vein Source?” Chu Feng asked in delight.

“Of course. That’s not all there is to it though. It also serves as a chip for us to threaten them,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Threaten?”

The look on Chu Feng’s face changed a little.

“Did you see the skeleton of the dragon beneath the golden lake? That’s the carcass of a true dragon, the skeleton of a divine beast. The energy of the Dragon Vein Source is derived entirely from the powers of this divine beast,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“That skeleton was really the divine beast of the legends?”

Chu Feng was shocked.

While he had realized that the skeleton had wielded extraordinary strength during its lifetime, Chu Feng didn’t think that it would actually be a divine beast.

After all, what were divine beasts?

They were beings that only existed in the legends, existences that had reached the level of gods.

It was hard to estimate or even fathom just how powerful they were.

“It was a real dragon, and the energy within the Dragon Vein Source comes from it. I wasn’t sure what would happen if Long Xiaoxiao were to absorb all of the energy in it, so I told you to add the medicinal fluid in. Not only will it help her absorb the domineering Dragon Vein Source, but it will also serve as a card to guard against her.

“Take for example, if she is unable to control the energy of the Dragon Vein Source in the end, and turns into some kind of terrifying monstrous beast, the medicinal fluid would immediately suppress her.

“I know that she’s your friend, and I was worried that you would hesitate about this, so I hid this matter from you till now,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Master, if you were planning to have Long Xiaoxiao enter the Dragon Vein Source right from the start, why did you still agree to the request of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief to allow Long Mumu to enter at the start then? Was it to embarrass them?” Chu Feng asked.

“I wasn’t thinking too much about it at the start. Initially, I was planning to open the Dragon Vein Source normally and have all of them share its energy together. However, when you came back and informed me of Long Xiaoxiao and her mother’s plight, I realized that just holding the Dragon Vein Source hostage wouldn’t be enough to get the two of them out of their current quandary.

“If Long Xiaoxiao and her mother want to change their standing in the Dragon Clan, Long Xiaoxiao will have to become strong herself. It was with such considerations in mind that I came up with this plan.

“However, I have to say that this plan is quite risky. Even I don’t have absolute confidence that it will work out. The energy from the Dragon Vein Source is simply too frightening, such that I can’t say for certain whether Long Xiaoxiao will be able to endure it or not.

“Nevertheless, this is still a golden opportunity for her to turn her life around. If she can get through this crisis, not only will she become the most esteemed person in the Dragon Clan, but her potential will also be boundless! On the other hand, if she fails in the end, death will be the only fate awaiting her.

“But to her, even if she were to die from the Dragon Vein Source, it would still be liberation for her. Her father is a callous man, so it is very likely for her mother to die at his hands in the future. Rather than face such a tragic fate, she would be better off taking this gamble.

“What do you say, my dear disciple?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“I agree with your view, master. I believe that even if I were to tell Princess Xiaoxiao the truth and have her make a decision, she would still choose to assimilate with the Dragon Vein Source,” Chu Feng replied.

“Of course. Who would be willing to give up such a valuable fortuitous encounter? If she fails, the only fate that awaits her is an end to her miserable life, but if she succeeds, she will transcend her limits and rise to the top. So, my disciple, are you regretting it now?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

“Regret? What do I have to regret?” Chu Feng was confused by those words.

“If Long Xiaoxiao succeeds, she will become someone who has the powers of a divine beast flowing through her body. She will become an incredible existence in the future. I gave you an opportunity earlier to become intimate with her, but you’re simply a letdown,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist scoffed disdainfully.

“So that’s the reason why you tried to...”

It was only at this moment that Chu Feng truly understood the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s intentions.

That ‘trial’ that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist created wasn’t intended as a prank at all, and he didn’t do it on a whim either. Rather, he was really intending to help Chu Feng through it. It was just that the method he chose to go about it was unacceptable to Chu Feng.

But that being said, Chu Feng was really touched by how much his master cared about him. He felt a surge of warmth flowing into his heart.

As for regretting the fact that he didn’t manage to get intimate with Princess Xiaoxiao, that was impossible.

Even if Chu Feng knew the truth right from the start, he would still have made the same decision in the end.

He didn’t think of himself as an honest gentleman, but he couldn’t bring himself to take advantage of others during their moment of weakness

In any case, after learning the truth from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng was no longer that worried anymore.

He turned to look at Long Xiaoxiao once more.

The pained look on her face didn’t lessen, but at the same time, it didn’t worsen either. It would appear that she was starting to get used to the energy of the Dragon Vein Source.

At the very least, it didn’t seem like she was having any problems at the moment.

So, Chu Feng sat by the side and waited quietly for her to be done.

...

Meanwhile, outside the Dragon Vein Source, there was a storm that was slowly stirring. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Long Mumu and her mother had returned to the palace of Long Mumu’s mother.

Long Mumu’s face was reddened, and her teeth were gritted tightly. Her eyes were filled with killing intent.

Her current look was like a volcano on the verge of exploding.

In contrast, Long Mumu’s mother was exceptionally calm, seemingly pondering something.

“Mother, I can’t swallow this! How can we be bullied by two mere outsiders? That’s the Dragon Vein Source, a fortuitous encounter that belongs to me and me alone! How can I allow that damned Long Xiaoxiao to snatch it away from me?”

Long Mumu looked at her mother with a wronged look in her eyes.

“Mumu, don’t worry. I’ll redress your grievances for you! Not only shall I take Long Xiaoxiao and her mother’s life, but I’ll also get rid of those two busybodies. They need not dream of leaving our Dragon Clan alive!” Long Mumu’s mother sneered coldly.
