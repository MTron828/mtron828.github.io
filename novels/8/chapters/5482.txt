Chapter 5482: Two Ways of Deciphering Formations

It was completely silent inside the dark corridor.

Knowing that none of them could rival Chu Feng, the Totem Dragon Clan’s juniors lowered their heads in fear, but they were trembling with anger too. They couldn’t believe that an insignificant nobody like Chu Feng could suppress them.

They were Totem Dragon Clansmen! Few in the world of cultivation would dare to confront them, let alone injure them.

Should an opportunity arise, they would never let Chu Feng off.

“I understand that some of you don’t like this, but that’s none of my business. I'm not here to steal your credit. I am only here because of your clan chief, Long Muxi, and Long Chengyu. Since your clan chief has assigned me your leader, I expect you to listen to my commands. You can try to defy my orders, but you’ll have to face the consequences. Feel free to complain to your clan chief once we get out of here. We’ll see who he punishes,” Chu Feng said.

The juniors were indeed thinking of ratting on Chu Feng, but they thought that his words made sense too. For reasons unbeknownst to them, their clan chief had a high opinion of Chu Feng. Even the other elders wouldn’t dare to recklessly touch Chu Feng under such circumstances. Eventually, the final verdict would fall on the clan chief’s shoulder.

Would the clan chief really side with them?

Honestly, they weren’t confident of that.

“Follow me if you wish to obtain the God Taboo Martial Skill. You stay put too, but I’ll remember your faces and report it to your clan chief,” Chu Feng said.

He knew that the juniors were still reluctant to submit to him even though he had intimidated them with his strength. The best way to curb them was still to bring out the clan chief’s name.

As expected, the juniors followed Chu Feng’s footsteps, albeit grudgingly. Even Long Zhizhi did the same too. Other than being afraid of the clan chief, they also wanted to prove themselves by accruing some contribution to the Totem Dragon Clan.

They spent a while traveling in the dark passageway before a hint of light appeared in front of them.

They hastened their footsteps, and soon, they found themselves standing on top of a towering cliff. The cliff was so high that even the clouds were far beneath them, and it was impossible to see what was below the clouds due to a barrier amidst them.

It sparked the crowd’s curiosity as to what was beneath the clouds, but what they were more interested in at the moment was the huge stone monument in front of them. It detailed the way to clear the subsequent test. There was a thin formation constructed on it.

There were two ways to clear the test—one easy and one difficult.

The difficult test required them to decipher the formation around the stone monument. Failure to do so upon taking on this test would spell the end of their journey.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

On the other hand, the easy test required them to continue marching on until they stumbled upon an easier formation. As long as they deciphered the formation, they would be able to advance to the next stage. However, the reward they received would be a hundredth of the difficult test.

Furthermore, it was stated in the stone monument that this reward would determine whether they would be able to conquer the God Taboo Martial Skill later on.

“Don’t say that I am not giving you a choice here. Let’s take a vote to decide which test to take.”

Chu Feng waved his hand and manifested two smaller stone tablets with his spirit power. On these stone tablets were the words ‘easy’ and ‘difficult’.

“Infuse your aura into the stone tablet to make your choice. I should remind you that there’s no free lunch in the world. Choosing the difficult formation is bound to be risky, but deciphering the easy formation might prove to be meaningless. Your decision may determine whether the Totem Dragon Clan obtains the God Taboo Martial Skill or not, so please choose prudently,” Chu Feng said.

The crowd hesitantly looked at Long Zhizhi. They still saw Long Zhizhi as their leader as they were still reluctant to submit to Chu Feng.

Long Zhizhi chose not to go against Chu Feng. She released a wisp of aura and fused into the stone tablet, choosing the difficult formation. A moment later, she soon looked at Chu Feng in confusion and asked, “What’s with that?”

“Just do it. Surely the least you can do is to write your name when you have already made your choice?” Chu Feng asked.

Long Zhizhi rolled her eyes, but she channeled her aura into the stone tablet to form the words ‘Long Zhizhi’.

The others quickly did the same as well.

Nine out of ten juniors had chosen the difficult formation. Their reasoning was that they wanted to maximize their chances of obtaining the God Taboo Martial Skill.

The rest who chose the easy formation didn’t explain their decision, but there was no one who faulted them for it either. It would appear that they were still harmonious on the inside.

“They are gutsier than I thought. I didn’t expect so many of them to choose the difficult formation. If I’m not mistaken, you were planning to choose the difficult formation too, right?” Eggy asked.

“Of course. Choosing the easy formation is as good as forfeiting this trial,” Chu Feng said.

“What’s the point of holding this vote then? You could have just made the decision on your own. What if they chose the easy formation?” Eggy asked.

“I’ll just have to veto their decision then. I’m the one who calls the shot here,” Chu Feng replied.

“Hah, you rascal!” Eggy burst into laughter.

Chu Feng’s intent for holding this vote was to see if the Totem Dragon Clan’s juniors were willing to risk their lives for their clan’s interests, but the final decision was still up to him.

“Chu Feng, why haven’t you chosen yet?” Long Zhizhi asked.

The crowd looked at Chu Feng as well. They wanted to know his choice even though the dust had settled.

“I’ll make my choice now.” With a snap of his finger, Chu Feng’s name appeared on the top of the stone tablet for the difficult formation. “I have already made my choice right from the start. What a coincidence that most of you chose the same as me. At the very least, it’s clear that our goals coincide. To be honest, I’m impressed that you’re willing to put your life on the line for your clan.”

“Aren’t you talking nonsense? We’re willing to die for the Totem Dragon Clan!” Many of the Totem Dragon Clan’s juniors scoffed at Chu Feng’s words.

“Good. Let’s hope that your courage isn’t just for show.”

Chu Feng dissipated the two stone tablets with a wave of his sleeves before hurling his fist at the stone monument.

Hu!

To the crowd’s shock, the thin formation didn’t shatter right away. Instead, it swiftly grew into a humongous formation that sealed off the path ahead. To make things worse, its transformation wasn’t just in terms of size but resilience too. It had become so firm that no one in Chu Feng’s group could hope to shatter it.

At the same time, the clouds beneath them began to scatter, revealing what was hidden beneath.

“That is…”

The crowd was horrified by what they saw. Even Long Zhizhi was unable to retain her composure.
