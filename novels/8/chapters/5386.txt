Chapter 5386: Pick Up Your Own Strength

“What’s wrong?” Eggy asked worriedly.

“I can’t speak!”

Chu Feng had wanted to ask the other party about this place, only to realize that he couldn't speak at all. He could only communicate with Eggy in his current state.

“Ah… You aren’t able to speak?” Eggy’s heart was put at ease.

She had thought that Chu Feng had encountered danger, and she was relieved to hear that she was wrong. Nevertheless, she still asked, “Why are you unable to speak? Have you discovered the reason why yet?”

“Not yet,” Chu Feng replied.

The woman assessed Chu Feng, but when she saw that he was completely silent, she muttered to herself, “Did the formation give me this to offer me assistance?”

She nodded in satisfaction to herself. “I guess it has a conscience, after all.”

Chu Feng knew that there were other ways to communicate other than speech, so he tried to write a message on the ground to relay his current plight. Yet, his body suddenly stiffened up before he could write a single character.

“Some kind of force is preventing me from communicating with her,” Chu Feng said.

He felt like a force in this realm had intentionally held his body back after realizing his intention to communicate via writing. It controlled his body to erase whatever he had already written, and it was only then that it returned control of his body.

“This is unfair! Why is she able to speak then?” Eggy was angry.

The woman was here to find the legacy too, but there was a gap in how they were treated.

Weng!

Just then, a golden light surfaced in the sky and formed ten words: Compete with your rival, and the winner clears the formation!

“Compete? Did you get this thing here to serve as my rival? This blasted place! This trial is already tough enough as it is, and you even found me an opponent now. This is too much!” the woman grumbled.

She glanced at Chu Feng before rushing ahead.

Chu Feng didn’t know what was going on at all, so he had no choice but to follow the woman and see what she did.

“Oi! Stop following me! Find your own resources!” the woman roared.

Chu Feng’s physical prowess seemed to be on par with the woman’s, which was likely to be an intentional doing by the formation. Despite the latter’s attempt to shake him off, he was still able to catch up and even run alongside her.

It didn’t take long for Chu Feng to become exhausted from the high-intensity running due to the restrictions on his cultivation and spirit power. His legs slowly became heavier, and breathing grew increasingly difficult as he felt like his lungs were going to explode.

Soon, he noticed a bundle of golden light ahead of him.

The woman sped up, and Chu Feng did the same too. He couldn’t use any of his observation means here, but his instincts told him that the bundle of golden light was likely to be beneficial to him.

Right before he was about to reach the bundle of golden light, the woman suddenly performed a sweeping kick to floor him.

Even though Chu Feng had lost his cultivation, he still retained his fighting skills. There was no way such a straightforward attack could work on him. With an overhead flip, he dodged the attack while overtaking the woman, thus reaching the golden light ahead of her.

Weng!

The golden light flowed into Chu Feng’s body, rendering him motionless. However, he could feel that the golden light was transferring its power to him.

“A formidable formation indeed.”

The woman quickly changed her direction and headed in another direction.

It took time for Chu Feng to absorb the power of the golden light, and he was unable to move in the meantime. He was much stronger by the time he regained his freedom, but the woman had already vanished without a trace.

“What a pity she escaped. Otherwise, you could have easily defeated her,” Eggy lamented.

“It probably isn’t that simple,” Chu Feng replied.

“What do we do now? That woman headed in that direction earlier. Should we give chase?” Eggy asked.

“She appears to be a smart person. She might have laid a trap for us. Let’s continue heading this way first,” Chu Feng said as he continued moving forward.

Chu Feng soon encountered a bundle of red light. It was a hundred times larger than the earlier bundle of golden light, but it emanated a dangerous aura that left him not daring to approach.

He stumbled upon even more bundles of light along the way, and they came in a diverse range of colors. It didn’t take him long to figure out the effects of the different bundles of light.

The golden bundle of light could be absorbed to raise one’s cultivation.

The silver bundle of light contained a weapon.

The blue bundle of light contained a martial skill.

Soon, Chu Feng’s cultivation reached the eighth level of the Spirit Realm. He was nowhere close to his true cultivation level, but he was much stronger than before. He also obtained a few handy weapons.

That boosted his confidence considerably. He decided to find out what was contained inside the red bundle of light, so he grabbed a spear from his back and stabbed it.

Boom!

The red bundle of light scattered into a burst of red aura and a brilliant golden light. The brilliant golden light here was much stronger than the golden bundles of light he had encountered thus far, which meant that he could significantly raise his cultivation by absorbing it.

A furious roar shook the earth. A hundred-meters huge red lion emerged from the scattered red aura and charged at Chu Feng.

“I knew that it wouldn’t be that simple.”

Without any hesitation, Chu Feng turned around and fled, knowing that he wasn’t a match for the lion. Fortunately, he had already learned a movement skill that enhanced his speed.

After chasing him for some distance, the red lion turned around and returned to its original position. The scattered red aura gathered around it, and it reverted to its original state as a red bundle of light.

By now, Chu Feng had mostly figured out his current situation.

His cultivation and means had been sealed. If he wanted to raise his cultivation or obtain other means, he would have to absorb the bundles of light lying around. Of course, the enhancements from these bundles of light were temporary. He would lose them once he left the realm.

But right now, he needed these enhancements in order to defeat the woman!

The woman clearly knew about these beforehand, so she was probably running all around looking for bundles of light to raise her fighting prowess.

Boom boom boom!

A loud rumble suddenly echoed from the distance. Chu Feng heard terrifying voices reminiscent of ghostly wails approaching him.

“What with the rumbling?” Eggy asked.

“Danger seems to be approaching us. We’ll have to quickly raise our cultivation.”

Sensing that something was amiss, Chu Feng hurriedly looked for more bundles of light to raise his fighting prowess.

…

Meanwhile, Jie Zhou paid a visit to the black-haired woman who had brought Chu Feng into the Divine Inheritance Ground, Lord Shuang Yu.

“Young master Jie Zhou, are you certain you want to deal with Chu Feng?” Lord Shuang Yu asked.

“I have no other choice. He ruined my reputation. Lord Shuang Yu, you have to help me,” young master Jie Zhou said.
