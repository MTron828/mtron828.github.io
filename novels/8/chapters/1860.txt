MGA: Chapter 1860 - Monstrous Dragon Space Shattering Formation

Yaojiao Guang saw Duan Jidao. He stepped forward and asked, “Little friend Chu Feng, this senior is?” He naturally knew that Duan Jidao was that expert from the World’s Hidden Valley.

However, he had wanted to know exactly who it was that had occupied the World’s Hidden Valley, for him to be that overwhelmingly powerful.

“Senior Duan...” Chu Feng did not directly answer Yaojiao Guang. Instead, he looked to Duan Jidao. He was asking for Duan Jidao’s opinion, whether or not he was willing to tell Yaojiao Guang the truth.

“This old man’s name is Duan Jidao. Over the years, I have disturbed your King Monstrous Dragon Race. However, my actions were because I possessed some secret troubles. I hope that everyone from the King Monstrous Dragon Race will not mind this matter,” Duan Jidao clasped his hand at Yaojiao Guang and the two War Faction’s elders behind him. His tone was serious and extremely apologetic.

Actually, with Duan Jidao’s personality, he was not someone that would lower his head and apologize to the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. Merely, he was able to tell that the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts possessed an extremely significant relationship with Chu Feng. Else, how could they have dispatched such a grand disposition of forces to fight for him?

Thus, merely in this account, Duan Jidao had to give the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts face.

“Duan Jidao? Senior, might you be that Duan Dynasty’s Duan Jidao?” Yaojiao Guang asked in shock. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Precisely. However, Clan Chief Yaojiao, you shouldn’t address me as senior. In terms of age, this old man is much younger than you,” Duan Jidao said with a beaming smile.

“Heavens! It’s actually really the legendary Duan Jidao,” After Yaojiao Guang verified his identity, not to mention the other King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, even the two War Faction’s elders were endlessly shocked.

Duan Jidao’s reputation in the Holy Land of Martialism was truly enormous.

At this moment, after their moment of shock, they all felt regret for their previous actions of repeatedly trying to suppress the World’s Hidden Valley. If they knew that it was Duan Jidao that had occupied the World’s Hidden Valley, how would they possibly have doen something like that?

After all, Duan Jidao was a frightening existence that possessed the strength to be able to extinguish their King Monstrous Dragon Race by himself.

“I never would’ve expected that we would be able to fight alongside the renowned Duan Jidao. It would appear that our King Monstrous Dragon Race’s trip here has not been made in vain,” Yaojiao Guang said in a very excited manner. At this moment, he was feeling extremely happy.

Originally, he had been determined to face death by leading this grand army to the Ximen Imperial Clan to rescue Chu Feng’s friends. However, with Duan Jidao joining them, he was able to see the dawn of victory.

“The King Monstrous Dragon Race is a righteous and loyal race. I am also deeply honored to be able to fight alongside the King Monstrous Dragon Race.”

“Merely, this battle is no small matter. It could even be said that if we do not succeed, we will end up dying. I believe that everyone here does not wish for needless casualties.”

“Thus, we cannot proceed toward the Ximen Imperial Clan just like this. For the sake of the unexpected, we must make absolute preparations,” Duan Jidao said while looking at the King Monstrous Dragon Race’s army.

“Brother Duan, what do you have in mind?” Yaojiao Guang asked.

“I know of a formation by the name of Monstrous Dragon Space Shattering Formation. This formation is created by the combination of the Monstrous Race’s bloodline’s power. It just so happens to be suited to the King Monstrous Dragon Race’s army.”

“For example, the King Monstrous Dragon Race’s grand army of eight hundred thousand warriors here could evenly distribute their strength into eight smaller units. Then, each of them could set up a Monstrous Dragon Space Shattering Formation.”

“Furthermore, with the help of these Monstrous Dragon Banners here, your grand army of eight hundred thousand will no longer be Half Martial Emperors. Instead, they’ll become eight Martial Emperors.”

“While their offensive power might only be on par with rank one Martial Emperors, their defensive power will be on par with rank three Martial Emperors.”

“In other words, they will be able to easily defeat those with a cultivation below rank one Martial Emperor. However, even if a rank three Martial Emperor wished to harm them, they would not be able to do so,” Duan Jidao said.

“There’s actually such a miraculous formation?” Hearing those words, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts’ expressions all changed. Their King Monstrous Dragon Race had existed for many years, and also possessed many special formations. However, it was still the first time that they’d heard of a formation like the one Duan Jidao had just described.

“How could the formation created by Lord Emperor Huang be false?” Duan Jidao asked with a smile.

“Lord Emperor Huang? Could it be Emperor Huang, Huangfu Shou?” Yaojiao Guang and the two War Faction’s elders asked together.

“Precisely,” Duan Jidao nodded his head while smiling.

“In that case, brother Duan, we’ll have to trouble you,” Yaojiao Guang and the two elders of the War Faction nodded. While they might not trust a formation created by someone else, they would absolutely trust a formation left behind by Emperor Huang, Huangfu Shou. After all... he had been an era’s overlord.

Then, Yaojiao Guang separated the army of several hundred thousand into eight units of equal strength.

Then, Duan Jidao personally began to teach them the Monstrous Dragon Space Shattering Formation. Logically, the talent of the individuals among the King Monstrous Dragon Beast army would vary drastically. Thus, to have them all learn a single formation would be an extremely difficult task. For them to master it in a short period of time would be an even more impossible matter.

However, Duan Jidao’s teachings were extremely brilliant. He made it so that they were able to understand and comprehend his words immediately. With the use of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts’ special bloodline’s power and the precious treasures that were the Monstrous Dragon Banners, Duan Jidao managed to, in the short period of a single day, transform the King Monstrous Dragon Beast’s army of several hundred thousand into eight Monstrous Dragons that wreaked havoc through the sky.

Each of these eight Monstrous Dragons were close to ten thousand meters in length. As they galloped through the sky, they emitted truly earth-shattering might, and were extremely terrifying.

Furthermore, they were extremely imposing, as they were emitting the auras of rank three Martial Emperors. If those huge monsters were to attack the Four Great Imperial Clans’ army and charge around violently, who could possibly withstand them?

“Emperor Huang is truly Emperor Huang. He left behind many remarkable treasures.”

As Chu Feng looked at the eight enormous dragons in the sky, he was unable to contain himself from gasping in admiration. He knew that regardless of how strong the bloodline of the King Monstrous Dragon Beast’s army of eight hundred thousand might be, it would still be impossible for them to turn into those overwhelmingly powerful eight enormous dragons with their current cultivations.

The reason why they were capable of transforming into those eight enormous dragons was all because of the eight treasures that Duan Jidao had bestowed to them. In other words, it was all because of the eight Monstrous Dragon Banners.

In other words, it was not that the Monstrous Dragon Banners were assisting the King Monstrous Dragon Beast army successfully set up the Monstrous Dragon Space Shattering Formation. Rather, the King Monstrous Dragon Beast army had relied on the eight Monstrous Dragon Banners in order to turn into those eight enormous dragons.

Thus, Chu Feng felt those eight Monstrous Dragon Banners to be extremely precious treasures. Looking at it from a certain angle, they were even more precious than Imperial Armaments.

Imperial Armaments were things that only true experts could wield and unleash their true power. For ordinary people, other than being extremely precious, Imperial Armaments did not possess much actual practicality.

However, the eight Monstrous Dragon Banners were able to turn the King Monstrous Dragon Beast’s army of eight hundred thousand into eight incomparably powerful, strong and enormous dragons. Not only did this increase their battle power, this also allowed them to be safer. Those eight Monstrous Dragon Banners were the true treasures.

“Great, great, great. With this, how could the Four Great Imperial Clans possibly defeat us?”

“Likely, they will be scared witless and start pissing their pants in terror the moment they see us. Hahahaha!!!” Seeing that their clansmen had turned into eight enormous dragons, the one that was the most happy was none other than Yaojiao Guang.

This battle was no small matter. Even though the army of eight hundred thousand that he had brought with him were all elites, they would not be able to withstand a single blow before Martial Emperors. Even if they were to fight against the Four Great Imperial Clans’ army, there would inevitably be casualties among them.

As he was their Clan Chief, it would be impossible for him to not feel heartache from the casualties. To speak of it unpleasantly, they were his subordinates. However, it also remained that they were his clansmen.

Yet, at that moment, his army of eight hundred thousand had turned into eight enormous dragons that even rank three Martial Emperors could do nothing to. Not to mention the shrimp soldiers and crab generals, even if the Four Great Imperial Clan’s’ Martial Emperors were to encounter them, they would immediately turn around and flee. Unless there were rank four Martial Emperors that acted to attack them, his clansmen would, with absolute certainty, not face any fatal danger.
