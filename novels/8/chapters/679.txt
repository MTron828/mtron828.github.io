MGA: Chapter 680 - Splitting Fortune When It Exists

“It’s quite good for that Wuqing to have left. Actually, even if Junior Dong Xue didn’t drive him away, I would have thought of something too. After all, this Martial Marking Immortal Realm opens only once every six years. I don’t want to be delayed because of him.

“As for that girl Chun Wu, she is indeed too willful. However, she herself chose this road, so it can’t be blamed on others. Without our help, she simply cannot achieve much greatness.

“At the time when the Martial Marking Immortal Realm closes and she can only exchange some low-rank martial skills, let her regret then.” The kind smile on Xia Yu’s face was no more, and actually became the same face as Dong Xue’s; maybe even more sinister.

“But the Martial Marking Immortal Realm’s danger is unpredictable, and Junior Wuqing has had some conflicts with Ya Fei. If they meet the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, wouldn’t the two of them be...?” Qiu Zhu was still a bit worried.

“I say, Junior Qiu Zhu, you have too kind of a nature. You always consider others, but who will consider you? Don’t forget that the world of cultivation is a world where people eat people. If you go on like this, I’m afraid you wouldn’t even know if you were sold off to someone one day,” Dong Xue said a bit displeasedly.

“Okay, okay. Don’t be so noisy because of a Wuqing. Although we don’t have him dragging us behind, we must still conserve time. Qiu Zhu, you don’t want the number of Martial Markings you obtain this time to be lower than Ya Fei, right?” Xia Yu asked Qiu Zhu.

“I...” Qiu Zhu did not reply, but her appearance gave Xia Yu an answer.

“Then stop staring and let’s quickly move.” As Xia Yu spoke, she already flew towards the distant sky. As for Dong Xue, she too followed quickly after.

Seeing this, Qiu Zhu bit down on her lips and hesitated a short while. However, ultimately, she flew after the two of them.

At the same time, Chu Feng and Chun Wu had flown down from the low sky and arrived atop a bare hill...

“Junior Wuqing, why have you come down? Martial Markings cannot be found on this mountain range.” Seeing Chu Feng gazing at the bare little hill with a face full of happiness, Chun Wu felt very confused.

“Shh.” Chu Feng indicated for her to be quiet, then with a thought, opened a Sealing Spirit Formation. Shortly after, he started to lay an Opening Spirit Formation with extremely skilled techniques.

At first, Chun Wu blinked when looking at Chu Feng’s actions, her eyes full of surprise and became increasingly bewildered because she simply could not understand what Chu Feng was doing. If she were unacquainted with him, and saw some person doing that sort of thing on a bare hill, she would have definitely thought that person to be mentally ill.

However, after Chu Feng laid an Opening Spirit Formation with lightning quick methods and lightly yelled “Open”...

With a swish, a golden light shot out from that formation and with a bang, it crashed into the Sealing Spirit Formation.

“Heavens! Th-th-this is actually a Martial Marking! What’s going on? Where did it come from?” At that instant, Chun Wu was stupefied because she could see the object that had collided into the Spirit Formation was a Martial Marking.

But that place had already been sealed shut, so where did the Martial Marking come from? Thinking back and forth, Chun Wu’s eyes suddenly lit up, then shortly after, she cast her gaze towards the bare hill on which Chu Feng laid an Opening Spirit Formation, and asked with a face full of shock, “Junior Wuqing, you wouldn’t have forced this Martial Marking out from that hill, right?”

“Senior Chun Wu is truly smart. Truthfully, I can see things that others cannot, and this seemingly normal small hill is, in reality, a place that Martial Marking live in. That’s also why I had to fly low and sweep my gaze constantly at the mountain range below,” Chu Feng explained with a smile. At the same time, he willed the Sealing Spirit Formation to force the Martial Marking before Chun Wu, and added, “Senior Chun Wu, I already have a third Martial Marking. This one is yours.”

“Giving it to me... Really? But this is...” Seeing that Chu Feng actually planned to give the Martial Marking to her, Chun Wu was both surprised and joyed; however, she was a bit embarrassed.

“Senior Chun Wu, I’m guessing if you also had this ability, you would definitely do the same as me. Right now, you and I are journeying together, so reasonably, we share both fortune and difficulties when they arise.”

Seeing Chu Feng insist in such a manner, Chun Wu could not decline and could only open up her hand and crush the Martial Marking, sending it into her arm.

Seeing the third Martial Marking appearing on her snow-like arm, Chun Wu’s heart was very complicated. However, she could confirm that coming after Chu Feng was a very correct decision. She seemed to be able to see the result of her bountiful harvest as well as her three seniors’ endlessly shocked faces upon the completion of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.

Indeed, Chu Feng did not disappoint Chun Wu. As everyone was searching for and fighting over Martial Markings in the air, only Chu Feng and Chun Wu searched above the mountain ranges. Moreover, the harvest they got made Chun Wu pleasantly surprised, and ecstatic. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

On the eighth day of the opening of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, there appeared eighty Martial Markings on her arm. A harvest like this was something she did not even dare to imagine before. Prior to entering, the best harvest she anticipated was no more than fifty Martial Markings.

Yet, at present, the Martial Marking Immortal Realm event hadn’t even ended, yet she had already gained far more than she expected. Other than feeling excitement and happiness, what she felt more was admiration towards Chu Feng because he truly was very special. So special he nearly surpassed what she could think of.

“Senior Chun Wu, what are you thinking about? This Martial Marking is yours,” said Chu Feng as he pointed at the Martial Marking that was just forced out and was currently sealed by a Spirit Formation.

“Junior Wuqing, I don’t need it. In the past few days, it’s all because of you that I can obtain so many Martial Markings. To me, this is already enough.

“You don’t need to split the Martial Marking you get from now on with me. Use them yourself. With that, not only would you be able exchange them for a Forbidden martial skill, you even have a chance to break the record Murong Xun set,” Chun Wu advised.

“Ho...” However, Chu Feng only lightly smiled at Chun Wu’s words, then said, “It really isn’t easy to break his record, but that is not something I wish to do.

“Right now, I only want to do one thing. It’s to share evenly with you all the Martial Markings found within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. I’ve already said that we share both fortune and difficulties. You’ve done the ‘difficulties’ part, so I must also do the ‘fortune’ part.”

“Junior Wuqing, you...” After hearing Chu Feng’s words, though Chun Wu’s heart was warm, it ached at the same time. Her beautiful eyes were actually a bit wet as they glittered with sparking tears.

*hmm* Just at that moment, the Martial Marking was forced before Chun Wu, and Chu Feng said with a smile, “Senior Chun Wu, Forbidden martial skills are indeed my goal, but my goal is for both of us to obtain Forbidden martial skills. You must help me complete it!”

And when she looked at Chu Feng’s dazzling smile as well as his sincere gaze, Chun Wu really could not find any reason to refuse. She could only wipe away the tears from the corners of her eyes, curl her lips up to form a sweet smile, nod, and say, “Mm.”
