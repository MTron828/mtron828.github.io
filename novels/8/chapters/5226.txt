Chapter 5226: A Good Chance To Get Them in a Swoop

That being said, Chu Feng still hoped to personally deal with Yue Lian to exact vengeance for Yue Ling, especially when he thought about the atrocities committed by the latter.

“I’m sorry, benefactor,” Yue Ling suddenly said.

“What’s wrong, Yue Ling?” Chu Feng asked.

“I’ve brought you trouble. He’ll definitely try to exact vengeance on you,” the conscience-stricken Yue Ling replied.

“You don’t need to worry about that. Your problem is nothing compared to what I have on me. Yue Ling, you shouldn’t dwell too much on this matter. It’s not worth getting upset over a bastard. He’s not worth your time, you hear me?” Chu Feng said.

He honestly thought nothing about Yue Lian. So what if the latter was a guest elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?

Other than Old Cat and Song Yuwei, there was no one in the Totem Galaxy who knew his background. He didn’t even hesitate to turn the Situ World Spiritist Clan into his enemy, let alone a mere Yue Lian.

It was true that Yue Lian was stronger than him now, but it was not as if Chu Feng would forever remain where he was. It was only a matter of time before he became strong enough to stomp on Yue Lian.

What rights did he have to challenge the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion if he was afraid of even someone of Yue Lian’s caliber? He would never save his mother at this rate. He wouldn’t be worthy of being the son of Chu Xuanyuan and Jie Ranqing.

Chu Feng searched the bodies of Yue Hui and the vicious woman’s body. The former didn’t have anything valuable, but the latter had some useful pills, treasures, and formations. He then gave both of their origin energies to Eggy, but they weren’t of much help to her.

Unfortunately, the treasure that was used to stabilize the protective formation inside Yue Hui’s body had shattered when the formation was breached.

Chu Feng proceeded to erase the memories of the two scantily-dressed women before tossing them at the foot of the Nameless Sect’s mountain.

Once he was done, he turned his attention to Yue Ling and tried to heal her. He was able to fix her appearance, but he wasn’t able to recover her cultivation.

He first returned to the Nameless Sect together with Yue Ling to inform the others that they had offended a powerful transcendent. He advised them to quickly leave this realm and lie low for the time being so as to avoid trouble.

Even though Chu Feng and Yue Ling had brought them trouble, those from the Nameless Sect weren’t angry in the least. They knew that the Nine Levels Pavilion would have quelled them had it not been for Chu Feng standing up for them back then. Instead, they thanked Chu Feng and Yue Ling for their reminder before hurriedly taking their leave.

Yue Ling initially intended to leave with the members of the Nameless Sect. Her master had taken her in and raised her up, and she wanted to return the debt even though her cultivation was now crippled.

However, Chu Feng didn’t think that it was safe for her to stay with the Nameless Sect, especially after having witnessed how they had previously sold out Yue Ling. There was no guarantee that they wouldn’t do the same again.

So, he wanted to have Yue Ling follow Lord Yuwei.

To be honest, he was reluctant to bring Lord Yuwei together with him anymore after the previous incident. It would have been a huge help to have a Half-God level cultivator with him since he was still at Martial Exalted level himself and the Asura King was sealed off, but he was afraid that a situation similar to that before would happen once more.

He thought that it would be best for Lord Yuwei to go into hiding together with Yue Ling for the time being. Without having to worry about anyone, he would finally be able to go all out.

Thus, Chu Feng brought Yue Ling over to Bitter Remembrance, where they met with the fully-recovered Song Yuwei. With Yue Ling’s permission, he shared her story with Bitter Remembrance and Song Yuwei.

The two of them were infuriated to learn of the matter, and they felt deeply sympathetic for Yue Ling. In fact, the two of them even offered to take Yue Ling in as their disciple and help her rebuild her cultivation.

With the help of these two masters, Yue Ling should be able to exceed her previous limitation soon enough and rise to a greater height than before.

That being said, it wasn’t safe for them to remain in this realm anymore after all that had happened. Yue Ling’s father was an incredibly powerful world spiritist whom neither Bitter Remembrance nor Song Yuwei could rival.

It would be troublesome if they were caught by him, so they decided to leave this realm.

Bitter Remembrance had spent much of his time wandering around the world, so he knew about quite a few good hiding spots. It was just that there were so many options that they needed to give the matter some thought.

While Bitter Remembrance was contemplating the matter, Chu Feng returned to the Nameless Sect and searched the mountain range. He had a feeling that Lord Qin Jiu’s true legacy was hidden amidst the mountain range, but he wasn’t able to find it for some reason.

This baffled him.

If Lord Zhenlong and Yue Ling’s ancestors were able to find Lord Qin Jiu’s true legacy, there was no reason why he couldn’t do the same. Perplexed, he took out the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, but the latter didn’t offer him any help.

“What’s going on? Is it due to my lack of talent?”

Chu Feng was frustrated with the situation.

“Chu Feng, is it possible that the legacy is elsewhere?” Eggy asked.

“I don’t know where Yue Ling’s ancestor found the legacy, but the location Lord Zhenlong has pointed out to me is this mountain range,” Chu Feng replied. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Perhaps the legacy has run away?” Eggy asked.

“Milady Queen, you have a vivid imagination. How can a legacy run away when it doesn’t have any feet?”

Chu Feng was amused to hear those words.

“You never know. There are all sorts of oddities in the world. The legacy is the one that’s losing out by not showing itself to you. Our Chu Feng might not be a looker, but there’s no question about his talents,” Eggy said with a smile.

“What? Who says that I’m not a looker?”

Eggy was able to clear Chu Feng’s gloomy mood with just a few remarks. That was the charm she had.

“Forget it. It might be due to the limitations of my current strength. I’ll come back again after becoming a God-cloak World Spiritist.”

Chu Feng was frustrated, but he could only let things slip. What else could he do when he couldn’t find the true legacy after trying everything he could think of?

Thus, he left the mountain range and returned to Bitter Remembrance’s place.

By then, the group had already decided where they would head to. Bitter Remembrance was going to accompany Song Yuwei and Yue Ling too.

From a quick chat with Bitter Remembrance, Chu Feng learned that the location was an Ancient Era’s secret realm the latter had stumbled upon during one of his journeys. The secret realm wasn’t large and didn’t have any incredible effects like hastening one’s rate of cultivation, but it did have a powerful Ancient Era’s formation that only granted entry to those who knew about the proper way to enter the secret realm.

It just so happened that Bitter Remembrance knew what the proper way was.

It would be hard for Yue Lian to find them if they sought refuge in the secret realm. Even if Yue Lian somehow learned about their whereabouts, he wouldn’t be able to do anything without knowing the proper way of entering the secret realm.

Quoting Bitter Remembrance’s words, “Even a peak Half-God level cultivator would find it hard to breach the secret realm.”

While it hadn’t been long since Chu Feng became acquainted with Bitter Remembrance, his gut feeling told him that the latter was a trustworthy individual. Thus, he approved their plan too.

“Young master Chu Feng, are you not coming with us?” Song Yuwei asked Chu Feng in surprise.

He had asked Bitter Remembrance for a map on the secret realm where they were going to hide, but he showed no inclination to go with them.

As a matter of fact, Chu Feng was indeed not going to accompany them. He couldn’t wait to go after the SItu World Spiritist Clan.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan had been a thorn in his heart for far too long. He wouldn’t be able to rid the uncomfortable feeling in his chest until he finally erased them once and for all. He simply couldn’t forgive them for what they had done to his grandmother.

Admittedly, he still wasn’t strong enough to crush the Situ World Spiritist Clan yet, but there were other ways he could exact vengeance on them.

“Elder Yuwei, I have other matters to attend to. I’ll visit you once I’m done with my business,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

He had chosen not to speak the truth because he didn’t want to worry Song Yuwei.

“Young master Chu Feng, you’re going after the Situ World Spiritist Clan, right?”

Song Yuwei saw right through him.

Chu Feng had already shared his worries with Song Yuwei when he brought Yue Ling over earlier. He had suggested for her to take care of Yue Ling and to leave the Situ World Spiritist Clan to him.

Song Yuwei knew that she was nothing but a baggage to Chu Feng after the previous incident, so she reluctantly accepted his suggestion.

This was why she knew what Chu Feng was going to do.

Seeing that it was impossible for him to hide the matter from Song Yuwei, he said with a chuckle, “Elder Yuwei, you don’t have to worry about me. I know what I am doing.”

Song Yuwei lowered her head in shame. She hated how she was unable to be of any help to Chu Feng.

“Young master Chu Feng, you should accompany us to the secret realm. An event is going to be held there very soon,” Song Yuwei said.

“What event?” Chu Feng asked.

“Bitter Remembrance told me that the Situ World Spiritist Clan is going to host a junior hunting competition in that realm very soon. The most talented juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan would be participating in the event, and I heard that the hunting ground is only open to juniors,” Song Yuwei said.

“That’s great news!”

Chu Feng’s eyes shone upon hearing the news.

Wasn’t this a great opportunity for him to eliminate all of the talented juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan in a single swoop?
