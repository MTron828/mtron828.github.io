Chapter 5167: Chasing the Dashing Male Disciple

Chu Feng had said those words quietly, so the disciples of the nameless sect didn’t hear him. The dashing male disciple thought that Chu Feng was really afraid of him, and that made him even more gleeful.

“Junior, you don’t have to be afraid if you encounter such toads in the future. I’ll protect you,” he boasted.

“Senior, stop talking,” the beautiful woman replied.

She didn’t like how her senior was behaving.

“What are you afraid of? He’s just a coward!” the dashing male disciple continued speaking in a loud voice, oblivious to his junior’s displeasure.

Seeing that her words were not getting through, the beautiful woman decided to ignore him altogether.

“Young master, my senior has a foolhardy personality. I’d like to apologize to you on his behalf,” she sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.

“Young miss, you need not apologize. You didn’t do me any wrong,” Chu Feng replied.

Of the disciples of the nameless sect, the only one who had incurred his displeasure was the dashing male disciple. His impression of the others was fairly decent, especially the beautiful woman. Not only did she try to dissuade the dashing male disciple who was acting so arrogantly, but she also discreetly sent a voice transmission to apologize to him on her senior’s behalf.

City Lord Liang was angered by the dashing male disciple’s relentless taunts, but when he thought about the severe condition Song Yuwei was in, he swallowed his anger and swore to settle the scores with the dashing male disciple after purchasing the ingredients.

The disciples of the nameless sect soon bought their stuff and left, and it was Chu Feng and City Lord Liang’s turn next.

Unexpectedly, the monastery owner told City Lord Liang that the ingredients were a little complicated and he needed additional time to process them. It took an entire hour before the items were finally ready.

By then, the disciples of the nameless sect had already disappeared without a trace.

“How unlucky. We were the only ones who had to wait that long for our ingredients. That rascal must have already escaped far away by now!” City Lord Liang grumbled.

He was feeling incredibly exasperated despite having successfully acquired the ingredients because he was planning to teach that dashing male disciple a lesson, but it was already too late to catch up with him now.

“City Lord Liang, why don’t you return first? I still have matters to attend to,” Chu Feng said.

“Young master Chu Feng, are you planning to look for them?” City Lord Liang asked.

Chu Feng smiled upon hearing the question before replying, “I’m not particularly angered by that fellow’s words, but I happen to be a narrow-minded person. I won’t allow anyone to humiliate me as they please. No one, other than my parents and my masters, is allowed to insult me. Naturally… he isn’t worthy either. I didn’t pursue the matter earlier because I didn’t want to offend the monastery owner, but I have no intention of letting him off the hook just like that.”

“But they have already been gone for an hour now. It’ll take quite a bit of effort for you to find them,” City Lord Liang replied.

“I secretly left an imprint on that fellow. I know where they are heading to,” Chu Feng replied.

“You did? You’re much more thorough than I thought. I should have thought of that too.”

City Lord Liang was delighted to hear that. At the same time, he felt deep admiration for Chu Feng. He was so caught up in his anger that he failed to consider the details.

“Young master Chu Feng, may I accompany you?”

City Lord Liang wanted to watch Chu Feng teach that rascal a lesson. After all, he was still boiling with anger over what that fellow said earlier.

“Feel free to come along,” Chu Feng replied.

He was fine with making this detour because he had checked Lord Yuwei’s condition earlier, and it had mostly stabilized. Thus, they didn’t have to urgently deliver these ingredients back. Besides, it wouldn’t take them too long to teach that rascal a lesson.

They followed the imprint on that dashing male disciple and soon arrived at a jungle. Amazingly, there was an ancient city hidden inside the jungle. The city was massive, but for some reason, everyone was gathered in a majestic palace located in the city center.

There was a long queue outside the palace, indicating that it might be some kind of store. The disciples of the nameless sect were in the queue too, and it was going to be their turn soon.

Chu Feng first scanned the people inside the palace. The people inside the palace didn’t conceal their cultivation, so he was able to tell that the seller was only at early Utmost Exalted level. There were also others in the palace too, and the strongest of them was at peak Utmost Exalted level.

There was a period of time when cultivators of their caliber were an insurmountable peak to him, but to the current Chu Feng, they were no different from ants. Peak Utmost Exalted level cultivators were worth nothing in the Totem Galaxy.

Yet, everyone still chose to obediently stand in queue.

It led Chu Feng to think that the owner of this place was a formidable person.

“City Lord Liang, do you know who is the master of this land?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young master Chu Feng, I’m afraid that I don’t know much about this land,” City Lord Liang replied.

“It doesn’t matter. Let’s make a move on them after they leave this place.”

Not wanting to offend the master of this land, Chu Feng chose not to make a move right away. He planned to wait till the disciples of the nameless sect were done purchasing their ingredients before making a move.

There was only one person in front of them anyway, so it shouldn’t take long.

Soon, it was finally the disciples of the nameless sect’s turn to purchase their items.

Shoosh!

Just as they were about to enter, numerous silhouettes suddenly descended from the sky and formed a line in front of the palace. There were 37 people in total, and they were all men. Most of them were middle-aged, though there were two white-haired elders amongst them.

The one leading the group was a young man. He, too, was a junior.

“What a commotion. So many people are shopping here. What did you all buy? Is there anything nice to eat? Bring them out so that I can have a taste,” the young man asked with a chuckle.

Those words were directed toward those in the palace, but his eyes remained focused on the beautiful woman of the nameless sect.

“Who are you? How dare you cut our queue?”

The dashing male disciple of the nameless sect who insulted Chu Feng earlier immediately stood forward. His attitude toward these people who swooped in from nowhere was horrible as well, similar to how he had treated Chu Feng and City Lord Liang earlier.

“What about it? I have always been fond of cutting queues, though there’s something that I like more than that.”

The young man’s eyes drifted to the beautiful woman of the nameless sect once more. This time, he even raised his eyebrows at her.

The dashing male disciple had insulted Chu Feng earlier for eyeing the beautiful woman even though Chu Feng didn’t do anything overboard. This time around, the other party was explicitly flirting with the beautiful woman. How could the dashing male disciple possibly tolerate that?

The beautiful woman’s face reddened in anger, and the dashing male disciple clenched his hands in fury.

“How dare you act so insolently to my junior? You’re courting death!”

The dashing male disciple released his might as a rank three Utmost Exalted level and hurled his fist at the young man.

“Hmph!”

With a cold harrumph, the young man flung his sleeves and dispersed the dashing young man’s oppressive might. Then, he flung his sleeves once more.

Bam! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The dashing male disciple and everyone else standing in queue were immediately sent flying across the air. Even the ingredient seller in the palace was caught in the commotion.

The young man’s cultivation was at rank seven Utmost Exalted level.

“Trying to play the hero when that’s all you’re capable of?” the young man sneered.

The dashing male disciple coughed out blood. Even though everyone was sent flying, most of them only sustained light injuries. The only one who was internally injured was the dashing male disciple.

“Audacious! Who dares to cause a mess here?”

The peak Utmost Exalted level man inside the palace immediately flew out. He was the one responsible for guarding the palace and quelling any conflicts that occur here.
