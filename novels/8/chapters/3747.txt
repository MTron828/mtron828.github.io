Chapter 3747 - Chu Feng Entering The Battle Again

After the violent trembling stopped, the sky turned bright again as the black gaseous flames started to dissipate.

The crowd was able to see that even though Yu Sha was not greatly injured, she was half kneeling in midair. Her appearance was, to a greater or lesser degree, rather sorry.

However, when they looked at Linghu Hongfei, he was not only completely uninjured, but even the Vast Heavenly Lens was still floating before him.

At that moment, Yu Sha’s overwhelming black gaseous flames that had covered the sky had completely dissipated.

It was obvious which of the two of them was stronger.

“As expected of the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens’ mighty reputation is truly well justified.”

“So powerful. It actually managed to defeat such a mighty attack instantly. It is truly amazing.”

The crowd were all able to clearly sense how powerful Yu Sha’s previous attack was.

It was something that many people of the older generation present, even those peak Exalted-level experts, would feel fear toward.

Yet, such an attack was defeated by Linghu Hongfei’s Vast Heavenly Lens.

That had truly proved how powerful the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens was.

Hearing the praises from the crowd, not only was Linghu Hongfei pleased, but even the aloof and remote strongest expert of the Ancestral martial Starfield, Linghu Zhishi, revealed a proud smile.

After all, the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens not only represented Linghu Hongfei. It also represented the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

“I’ve said it already, it’s your loss.”

“Now do you believe me?”

Linghu Hongfei looked to the half kneeling Yu Sha and repeated what he had said previously.

“Damn it!”

Yu Sha was gnashing her teeth furiously and attempting to stand up.

However, even though she appeared to be uninjured, it took strenuous effort for her to stand up.

Seeing that, the crowd realized that Yu Sha was seriously injured. Merely, her injuries were not physical. More than physical injuries, it was her soul that had been injured.

Yu Sha’s injury was truly serious. Even though she had barely managed to stand up, she was unable to even stand firm after standing back up.

Seeing that Yu Sha was about to tumble, a powerful hand suddenly grabbed her arm and supported her.

It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng was at that moment, standing before Yu Sha.

Not only was he standing before her, but he also had a look of confidence on his face again.

“Let go of me. I’ll take care of him.”

Yu Sha struggled to break free. As Yu Sha struggled, Chu Feng was able to sense how furious she was.

“Girl, it’s enough.”

“Let me handle the rest." Chu Feng said to Yu Sha. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After hearing those words, Yu Sha finally calmed down.

For some unknown reason, when she looked to the current Chu Feng, the anger in her heart calmed down a lot.

Thus, she hesitated for a moment, and then took a glance at the world spirit gate Chu Feng had opened. In the end, being supported by Chu Feng, she slowly walked into the world spirit gate.

“Huuu~~~”

After Yu Sha entered the world spirit gate, Chu Feng let out a long sigh.

Dangerous. That was truly too dangerous.

Earlier, his bloodline power had decided to attack the Sacred Tree Seed, causing his cultivation to decrease.

Even though he had hidden the change to his cultivation and did not allow anyone to detect it, he himself knew very well that he would not have been able to continue to contend against Linghu Hongfei like that.

Fortunately, his bloodline power suddenly stopped attacking the Sacred Tree Seed. With that, Chu Feng had regained his cultivation.

If he hadn’t regained his cultivation, he would not have been able to contend against Linghu Hongfei.

Furthermore, with Yu Sha’s personality, even if she did not even have the strength to stand up, she would still insist on fighting Linghu Hongfei.

Should that be the case, Chu Feng knew very well what the outcome would be.

That animal Linghu Hongfei wouldn’t possibly hold back just because Yu Sha was a woman.

It might be possible for Yu Sha to be killed. Even if she didn’t get killed, her outcome would definitely be very miserable.

After all, even though Chu Feng was not present that day, Linghu Hongfei had still dug out Chu Lingxi’s eyes.

And now, Chu Feng was right before him. It was certain that Linghu Hongfei would be even more ruthless.

To Linghu Hongfei, being able to torture someone Chu Feng cared about before his eyes was something even more enjoyable.

“Linghu Hongfei, it’s about time to settle this." Chu Feng said to Linghu Hongfei.

Chu Feng was planning to unleash his hidden trump card.

The reason for that was because he could not be certain if his bloodline power would attempt to act out against the Sacred Tree Seed again.

If his bloodline power attacked the Sacred Tree Seed again, Chu Feng’s cultivation would once again be suppressed; would once again decrease.

Thus, he must quickly obtain victory and end the match.

“Very well. In that case, why don’t you show me what sort of abilities you possess?”

Linghu Hongfei only let out a cold sneer toward Chu Feng.

He was laughing very mockingly. The gaze that he looked to Chu Feng with resembled the gaze of someone looking at a clown.

At that moment, Linghu Hongfei was filled with confidence.

His confidence stemmed from his overwhelming strength.

Earlier, the attack Yu Sha had used was so powerful already. Even many of the older generation’s experts present were intimidated by it.

Yet, such an attack was dispersed by Linghu Hongfei’s Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens.

Because of that, Linghu Hongfei became even more confident in his Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens.

In fact, he felt that his Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens was the strongest technique in the entire world.

“Since you want to experience it, I’ll let you experience it.”

Chu Feng revealed a faint smile. Then, his expression turned serious.

Chu Feng began to form hand seals with his left hand, and placed his right palm onto his chest.

At the same time, Chu Feng closed his eyes.

However, right after he closed his eyes, he immediately opened them again.

“Buzz~~~”

At the moment Chu Feng opened his eyes, the people present, including Linghu Hongfei and Linghu Zhishi, all grew tense.

Judging from one’s naked eye, the current Chu Feng did not appear to be any different.

He did not give rise to any sort of imposing mighty power like that of Yu Sha. In fact, he did not even create a faint white light like Linghu Hongfei.

However, at that moment, the aura emitted by Chu Feng became extremely powerful.

It was like Chu Feng had a devastating and destructive power within him.

That power was not at all any weaker than the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens!!!

“What is going on? This sensation, it’s so powerful.”

“Exactly what sort of ability does Chu Feng possess?”

At that moment, the crowd were making all sorts of guesses. At the same time, they were filled with curiosity.

Chu Feng was most definitely going to unleash a very powerful attack. Merely, they did not know exactly what sort of technique he was going to use.

At the moment when the crowd were all puzzled, Gu Mingyuan said, “It’s an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill!!!”

“Exalted Taboo martial Skill?”

The crowd were once again stunned upon hearing those words.

“Chu Feng has also grasped an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill?”

“But, that shouldn’t be possible. Exalted Taboo Martial Skills are very precious; not to mention the Chu Heavenly Clan, not even the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan possesses an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.”

“Where did Chu Feng acquire that Exalted Taboo Martial Skill?”

At the same time as the crowd were feeling astonished, they were also feeling utter disbelief.

It wasn’t that they were looking down on Chu Feng. Instead, to the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Exalted Taboo Martial Skills were simply too precious.
