Chapter 3732 - The Same Person

“Earlier, you said that I’m not qualified to speak about your brother Zhu?”

“I might as well tell you this. In terms of being qualified to speak, I should be the most qualified to speak about that brother Zhu of yours.”

“Brother Liangqiu, am I correct?”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke again. However, when he said those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Chu Feng’s expressions both changed.

The reason for that was because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice had changed. That was no longer the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s voice. Instead, it had become identical to old man Zhu’s voice.

Furthermore, upon taking a closer look, both Grandmaster Liangqiu and Chu Feng were completely shocked.

They discovered that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s appearance had changed. His face had turned to that of old man Zhu’s.

It was not only his appearance; even his figure and aura had become completely the same as that of old man Zhu’s.

“Ox-nose, what the hell are you doing?!”

After a short moment of being stunned, Grandmaster Liangqiu became even more furious.

He felt that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was pretending to be his good friend, something that was extremely disrespectful toward his friend.

“Liangqiu, you actually failed to even recognize me? I’ve truly wasted my time being acquainted with you for so many years.”

“If you don’t recognize me... you should recognize this, no?”

As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he took out a writing brush.

The writing brush appeared to be very ordinary, even shabby. However, Chu Feng was able to tell that it was a world spiritist treasure. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You... why would you have...”

Compared to Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu reacted with a shocked expression.

Whilst others might not know that brush, he knew it.

That brush was something that he had given to old man Zhu.

Although that brush seemed to be very ordinary, it was completely unique!

At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu took two steps back, and began to size up the person before him.

After examining him for a bit, he came to a conclusion that the person before him was none other than his brother Zhu.

“Brother Zhu, so it was you... You’re actually still alive. You’re the one who brought Chu Feng out from the Mirror Core?”

“But, why did you decide to disguise yourself as that Ox-nose and play such a joke with me?”

“You clearly know that the person I hate the most is that Ox-nose.”

After coming to a realization, Grandmaster Liangqiu thought that old man Zhu had rescued Chu Feng and deliberately disguised himself as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to trick him.

However, to his surprise, old man Zhu let out a chuckle and said, “I am indeed your brother Zhu. However, I am also that Ox-nose that you detest the most.”

After he finished saying those words, old man Zhu’s appearance changed again. His appearance returned to that of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

He had an extremely gleeful smile on his face. However, that smile appeared rather vulgar. He was smiling mischievously, like a child that had managed to prank someone successfully.

“Senior, could it be that senior Zhu... is also you?” Chu Feng asked.

“Smart. Liangqiu, look at how dim-witted you are. You’re actually slower than a child," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he glanced at Grandmaster Liangqiu in a very mocking manner.

“Senior, since you’re senior Zhu, why did you want me to enter the Mirror Core?” Chu Feng asked with great confusion.

“Chu Feng, the seventy-nine-day appointment is actually a test that this old man had for you.”

“And now, you’ve successfully passed that test,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Chu Feng.

“You... you’re really brother Zhu???”

Compared to Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

He was still unable to accept the truth before him.

“Brother Liangqiu, do you still not understand?”

“The person who I really am is Ox-nose. As for that so-called brother Zhu, he was nothing more than a disguise of mine.”

“When I told you that I needed to enter the Mirror Core in order to save Chu Feng, that was a lie.”

“I did not enter the Mirror Core. Instead, I directly entered the Gate of Death and changed my appearance to that of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.”

“As for young friend Chu Feng, he would no longer be able to sense the terrifying power of the Gate of Death after being there for four hours. It’s actually not that I’ve helped him. Instead, the sound of the Death Bell will only resonate for four hours.”

“Should one be able to endure the Death Bell for four hours after entering the Gate of Death, the power of the Gate of Death will no longer affect them.”

“However, the great majority of people will have their souls explode and die within four hours.”

“However, not only did Chu Feng endure four hours of the bell, but he even helped Chu Xuanzhengfa endure for four hours as well.”

“Thus, it was actually all due to Chu Feng that they were able to survive. It’s not because I helped them,” said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“Senior, in that case, when you said that you’ve stayed in the Gate of Death for many years, that was also a lie?” asked Chu Feng.

“That wouldn’t be considered to be a lie. All these years, I’ve been staying in the Mirror Sea. Merely, I was not staying here as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Instead, I was staying here as the person you thought to be senior Zhu," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied with a smile.

“Brother Zhu, are you sure you’re not joking with me?” asked Grandmaster Liangqiu.

He still had a very complicated and even awkward expression.

He deeply detested the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He had even said malicious things about the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to his brother Zhu.

Never had he ever imagined that his brother Zhu was actually the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

Most importantly, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and his brother Zhu were simply people of two different worlds.

To suddenly discover that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and his brother Zhu were actually the same person, Grandmaster Liangqiu found himself momentarily incapable of accepting the truth.

“Haha. Brother Liangqiu, don’t blame me for deceiving you.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist patted Grandmaster Liangqiu’s shoulder and laughed heartily.

Although he was joking around, he was laughing in a very vile manner.

It seemed like he was taking deep joy in seeing the awkward appearance of Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“This...”

“This old man needs to calm himself.”

Grandmaster Liangqiu took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

After a long while, Grandmaster Liangqiu opened his eyes again and looked at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“So... you’re really able to help Chu Feng fuse with Divine Power?” Grandmaster Liangqiu asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

He was determined in his opinion that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was incapable of helping Chu Feng fuse with Divine Power.

The reason why he thought this way was because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had helped many people before. But, without exception, they had all failed.

On top of that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was a very boastful person, yet he had never accomplished anything that he had boasted about.

That was the reason why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was so infamous, and why even someone as upright as Grandmaster Liangqiu would feel such contempt for him.

However, upon finding out that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was actually his brother Zhu, his opinion of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist changed enormously.

After all, to his knowledge, his brother Zhu was someone that possessed unfathomable abilities.

If the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was truly his brother Zhu, it would mean that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was someone who possessed unfathomable abilities, and was most definitely not as simple as he appeared to be.

Because of that, Grandmaster Liangqiu felt that perhaps the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was truly capable of helping Chu Feng fuse with Divine Power.

“Of course. The reason why those people in the past failed is because their perseverance was insufficient, and their strength was lacking.”

“Chu Feng is different. He... will soon be able to fuse with his Divine Power, and become a Divine Body.”

“Brother Liangqiu, congratulations... you will become the person to witness Chu Feng becoming a Divine Body," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Grandmaster Liangqiu with a beaming smile.

“Brother Zhu, you’ve truly played an enormous prank on this old man.”

“No, I was wrong. I should address you as Ox-nose, no?”

Grandmaster Liangqiu finally smiled.

Chu Feng’s expression also changed. A faint amount of excitement and anticipation appeared in his eyes.

“Senior, you said that I’ll be able to fuse with my Divine Power soon?” Chu Feng asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.
