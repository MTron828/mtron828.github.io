Chapter 3538 - Scramble For The Fruit

“What am I to do about this?”

With his Heaven’s Eyes unable to detect anything, Chu Feng knew that he would have to rely on himself to escape from this illusion.

However, with even his Heaven’s Eyes being ineffective, how could it possibly be simple to escape from such an illusion?

Furthermore, even though Chu Feng was not caught up in the magma, that place was filled with scorching heat. The heat was extremely fierce. Regardless of whether it might be through his world spirit techniques or his martial power, Chu Feng was unable to withstand the heat.

Being scorched by the burning heat, Chu Feng felt enormous pressure upon even his soul.

While this would not cause any serious damage in the short term, if he continued to stay there, not only would Chu Feng’s body not be able to withstand the heat, but his soul and in turn his life would likely be melted by it too.

That said, Chu Feng did not panic because of this.

He knew very well that the more desperate of a situation he found himself in, the more he must maintain his calm. Otherwise... it would only make the situation worse.

......

Meanwhile, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others were all teleported to another region of the Void Sacred Tree. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Different from Chu Feng, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others were not isolated. There were tens of thousands of people gathered there, including many people from other powers.

Coincidentally, the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was also present.

Those people had all landed there. Furthermore, there was a golden fruit before them.

That said, that golden fruit was slightly different from the golden fruit Chu Feng had discovered.

The golden fruit Chu Feng had discovered resembled a little watermelon, whereas this golden fruit resembled a golden walnut.

It gave off a feeling of hardness. However, it did not possess the ruler’s aura emitted by the golden fruit Chu Feng had discovered.

Most coincidental of all, that golden fruit was closest to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Thus, according to the established rules, that golden fruit should belong to him.

However, this was a golden fruit, something that, according to legend, could allow one to enter the Sacred Palace Hall. Who would be willing to surrender such a rare opportunity to someone else?

“Truly, never would I have expected for the heavens to show such concern for me, for me to encounter the legendary golden fruit.”

After an old man saw the golden fruit, his eyes not only started to shine, but he even extended his hand and made a grabbing motion with the intention to suck the golden fruit over to him.

As for that old man, he was an elder from the Moyi Heavenly Clan named Moyi Qing.

That Moyi Qing was very powerful, and possessed the cultivation of a rank seven Exalted.

However, even with his cultivation, he was unable to move the golden fruit from a distance.

At the same time as that happened, a faint light that surrounded the golden fruit caught the crowd’s attention.

“There’s a defensive formation around that fruit. If we wish to take it away, we must breach that defensive formation first.”

“Merely, it seems that defensive formation is somewhat strange. We will need to carefully inspect it to determine how to breach it,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Brother Chu, that is not what’s important.”

Right at that moment, an extremely resounding and powerful voice was heard. The person who spoke was the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Dragon King Li.

At that moment, Dragon King Li had a very ugly look on his face. This was especially true when he looked to Moyi Qing; his gaze was filled with contempt.

“Elder Moyi, earlier, we had established the rule that the person who is closest to the fruit shall be the one to obtain it. Earlier, what did you just do? Were you trying to snatch away that fruit by force?”

It turned out that the reason why the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was so displeased was because Moyi Qing had tried to snatch away the golden fruit earlier.

“Humph, Dragon King Li, are you trying to show off here?” Moyi Qing cast a gaze of contempt back at Dragon King Li.

“I merely want to respect the rules of this place,” said the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“What are you going to do if I refuse to comply with the rules?”

As Moyi Qing spoke, he began to walk toward the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. At the same time, his rank seven Exalted aura became extremely ferocious.

With every step he took, the ground under his feet would tremble violently, causing many of the cultivators present to be unable to stand firm.

The current Moyi Qing was extremely impressive, like a god of war.

With Moyi Qing acting like that, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present all felt very uneasy.

They were all able to tell that Moyi Qing was unwilling to give in to their Lord Clan Chief. That was the reason why he planned to plunder the golden fruit by force.

Most importantly, ignoring the fact that Moyi Qing possessed the powerful Moyi Heavenly Clan behind him, his own cultivation of rank seven Exalted was already enough to intimidate the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.

“Wuuah~~~”

Suddenly, an oppressive might swept forth and beat back that Moyi Qing.

It was the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Not only was that oppressive might from him, but that oppressive might also possessed the cultivation of rank eight Exalted.

“Rank eight Exalted, you’ve actually become a rank eight Exalted?”

Sensing the aura of the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Moyi Qing felt extremely surprised.

He had known the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief for many years. At that time, he was already a rank seven Exalted, whereas the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was still only a rank six Exalted.

Although the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had also managed to become a rank seven Exalted later on, it took him many years to become one.

Because he had become a rank seven Exalted earlier than the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Moyi Qing had thought that he would not have to fear him should they end up fighting.

However, he had miscalculated. He had not expected the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to progress so quickly, and reach rank eight Exalted before him.

“Not everyone has a mediocre aptitude like you, unable to make any progress even after staying at the same cultivation for so many years,” The Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Moyi Qing with a mocking expression.

“Dragon King Li, don’t you have an exaggerated opinion of your own capabilities. You’re nothing more than a rank eight Exalted. You dare to make an enemy out of our Moyi Heavenly Clan with that cultivation?” Moyi Qing asked angrily.

“This old man has never said that I will make an enemy out of your Moyi Heavenly Clan. I am merely unable to tolerate your behavior.”

“If after your return to your Moyi Heavenly Clan, your clan is to find that your actions are in the right, and seeks to create trouble for me, there is nothing that I, Dragon King Li, will be afraid of.”

“As for now, I’d urge you to abide by the rules. Otherwise... this old man will definitely embarrass you,” the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

The Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief possessed a very tall stature, and a very resounding voice. Thus, with him standing there and staring sharply at Moyi Qing, Moyi Qing was unable to keep himself from cowering to the pressure.

This was especially true after he discovered that the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had a cultivation above his own. With that, he became extremely afraid.

Besides, he also knew very well that his decision to plunder the golden fruit was his own selfish desire. If the matter was reported to his clan, his Moyi Heavenly Clan might also punish him for it.
