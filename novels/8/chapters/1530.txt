MGA: Chapter 1531 - The Reappearance Of An Overlord

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, everything in Chu Feng’s surroundings disappeared. They were all shattered by the nine colored lightnings. At this moment, the frightening lights had also disappeared. As for those nine enormous beasts of lightning in the ninth heaven with unrivalled divine might, they too disappeared.

All around Chu Feng was endless darkness. It was as if he had entered an endless abyss. Terror and unease filled Chu Feng’s heart as he saw no way out of this predicament.

“Could it be that I’ve already died?”

“Is this what it feels like to die?” As Chu Feng looked at his surroundings, he began to mumble. He felt as if this was a dream. And yet, it was so life-like.

Right at this moment, a dazzling ray of light appeared before Chu Feng. Furthermore, that light was expanding. Soon, like the bright daylight of the sun, it covered Chu Feng.

Finally, the surrounding darkness around Chu Feng gradually started to be replaced with light.

At this time, Chu Feng discovered that he was still standing in that world spirit space, and that his hand was still on top of that oval shaped stone.

“So everything earlier was only an illusion. What a vivid and life-like illusion.”

Chu Feng came to a sudden realization that all the things that had happened earlier were fake. However, it had truly been too lifelike. Even he had not been able to discover that it was not real. Furthermore, upon touching his face, Chu Feng discovered that it was covered with ice-cold sweat.

“Crack~~~”

Right at this moment, a cracking sound suddenly sounded from underneath Chu Feng’s palm. Turning his gaze toward that location, Chu Feng was stunned. The oval shaped stone that he had had his hand on had actually shattered. Furthermore, it had shattered completely, and could not be recovered.

“What am I to do now?” Chu Feng was stunned. Chu Feng had known with the first glance that this stone was an extraordinary item. This stone contained a very ancient aura. Likely, it should be a very precious rare and priceless treasure. In fact, it might even be a unique item.

Else, there would be no reason for the Yan Clan to use a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist’s spirit formation to set off this stone.

However, Chu Feng had actually shattered this stone. What could he do now? How could he still have hopes that the Yan Clan’s Ancestor would help him? It would be great if that Yan Clan’s Ancestor did not get angry from his actions.

However, a stone this precious was something that Chu Feng could not afford to compensate!!!

Feeling helpless, Chu Feng began to carefully size up the stone. Even though he knew that it was likely hopeless, he still wanted to see whether or not he could restore it using his exceptional world spirit techniques.

Even if he were unable to completely restore it, it would still be better to restore a portion than to have it completely shattered. At least, that way, he would be able say that he had given his all to make up for his blunder.

......

At the same time. Outside of that world spirit space. The Yan Clan’s Ancestor and Dugu Xingfeng were still waiting.

“Senior, exactly why did you have Chu Feng enter that world spirit gate?” Dugu Xingfeng asked curiously.

“Don’t worry, there’s no danger to him. It’s merely a small test,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor said.

“Test? What sort of test is it?” Dugu Xingfeng asked. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“A test of potential,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor said.

“A test of potential? Senior, tests like that generally do not have a very high level of accuracy. Especially after having reached Chu Feng’s level, the result of a test of potential would be extremely imprecise.”

Dugu Xingfeng realized the Yan Clan’s Ancestor’s intention. He was planning to use this test to determine whether or not he would help Chu Feng.

It was very simple. If Chu Feng’s result from the test of potential was good, he would help him. If it was not good, he would not help him.

However, as Dugu Xingfeng was the Cyanwood Mountain’s headmaster, he also knew a lot of similar tests of potential. In fact, he knew very well what those sort of tests could do.

Generally, this sort of test would use a special sort of object to contact the person taking the test. Then, relying on the special power and reaction of the object, it would determine the person’s cultivation potential.

As for a test like that, could it be useful? It could. However, it was also dependent upon the person taking the test.

Generally, this sort of test would be more efficient for people who had just started on the path of cultivation. That was because those people still did not possess martial power in their bodies. After all, people who had just embarked on the path of cultivation would have to go through the spirit realm, the origin realm, the profound realm and the heaven realm. At that time, their bodies would not have any martial power. Without the interference of martial power, the accuracy of a potential test would be much higher.

However, once a person entered the Martial Lord realm and grasped martial power, it would be extremely difficult to test one’s potential. Generally, the result of such a test would have an enormous standard deviation.

The reason why Dugu Xingfeng said those things was because he feared that the test of potential the Yan Clan’s Ancestor was having Chu Feng take would give unreliable results.

“Rest assured, this testing method of mine is relatively special.”

“It is a testing method of the Ancient Era. It uses the Ancient Era’s Testing Stone as its foundation. Then, it is supplemented by a world spirit formation. The result of the test is very accurate.”

“That’s because it is not an ordinary test. Rather, one gets brought into an illusion. In that illusion, there are eighteen ominous beings that attack the person undergoing the test in succession.”

“The person undergoing the test will not be able to fight back. The only thing that can fight back is the power within the person undergoing the test. As for that power, it could either be an Inherited Bloodline, Divine Power or pure martial cultivation potential.”

“Either way, whatever the power the person undergoing the test might have, it will all take form at that time and exit the body of the person undergoing the test to fight against the eighteen ominous beings, one after another.”

“The greater the amount of ominous beings defeated, the greater the potential of the person undergoing the test,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor said.

“There’s actually such a testing method? However, since it’s an illusion, how would you know exactly how many of those ominous beings the person undergoing the trial has defeated?” Dugu Xingfeng asked.

“That’s the amazing aspect of the Ancient Era’s Testing Stone. The illusions are created and destroyed by it. The result will be recorded in the Ancient Era’s Testing Stone,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor said.

“In that case, has Yan Xie undergone that test?” Dugu Xingfeng asked.

“Of course. Did you think that I determined that Yan Xie was someone who possessed the potential to become an overlord based on my own guesses?” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor replied.

“Senior, might you be willing to tell this junior what the result of Yan Xie’s test of potential was?” Dugu Xingfeng asked curiously.

“There are eighteen ominous beings. In other words, there is a total of eighteen steps.”

“Truth be told, both I and Lord Flame Emperor also took this test of potential.”

“My result was ten steps. Those who reach ten steps will generally be able to become Martial Emperors. However, their talent is limited. Likely, they will linger around rank one Martial Emperor for the rest of their lives.”

“And the truth was indeed like this. It has been three thousand eight hundred and ninety-three years since I’ve become a Martial Emperor. However, to this date, I am still only a rank one Martial Emperor.”

“Likely, for the rest of my life, there will be no hope that I will be able to break through to become a rank two Martial Emperor,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor sighed. The result of that test of potential had practically determined the height that he could achieve in his life.

At the beginning, he had not trusted the result of the test. Thus, he had been training the entire time in the hopes of being able to break through. However, even after all these years, he was still unable to break through.

Even though he had not given up on training, he believed even more firmly that the result of that test was accurate.

“In that case, how many steps did Lord Flame Emperor manage to reach?” Dugu Xingfeng asked.

“Lord Flame Emperor reached fourteen steps. He had managed to become a peak expert of an era, but was unable to become an overlord.”

“As for Yan Xie, he reached sixteen steps,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor said.

“Sixteen steps, his result actually surpassed even that of Lord Flame Emperor? Furthermore, it was two steps above Lord Flame Emperor’s result?” Dugu Xingfeng was deeply shocked to hear those words. His expression became extremely grave.

If the accuracy of this Ancient Era’s Testing Stone was absolute, this meant that Yan Xie possessed extremely exceptional potential. As long as no accident were to occur, he would, sooner or later, be able to surpass the Flame Emperor.

At that time, the Yan Clan would reach the summit of the Holy Land of Martialism again. The Three Palaces, Four Clans and Nine Powers would all have to bow before it. As for this... it was no small matter. Instead, it was a major event that would smash apart the hierarchy of the human powers.

Back then, when the Yan Clan’s Ancestor mentioned that Yan Xie was a person with the potential to become an overlord, Dugu Xingfeng had only thought that to be what the Yan Clan’s Ancestor thought, and did not think that it would actually come to fruition.

However, it would appear that he had been mistaken. Likely, in the near future, an overlord would really appear in the Holy Land of Martialism.

After a separation of ten thousand years, the legendary overlord would once again reappear in the world.
