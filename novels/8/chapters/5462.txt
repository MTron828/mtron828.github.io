Chapter 5462: The World Spiritist Painter’s Identity

Chu Feng thought that it made sense for him to help out Long Chengyu in exchange for a God Armament. God Armaments were worth that price.

However, he couldn’t fathom what someone of Long Chengyu’s stature would need from him.

“Chu Feng, I knew that you’d accept my offer. Don’t worry about my request. It’s just a small matter. I’ll fill you in on the details later.” Long Chengyu first sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng before speaking out loud.

“Brother Chu Feng, our Armory Hall will be opening its gates soon. Our Totem Dragon Clan has been nurturing a few God Armaments, and once a year, our clansmen will have a chance to tame the God Armaments inside our Armory Hall. Since you don’t have a God Armament, why don’t you join me? There might just be a God Armament that is willing to pledge its loyalty to you.”

The others were stunned to hear those words, especially Long Kuitian.

“Young master, are you sure that you want to invite young friend Chu Feng to our Armory Hall?” Long Kuitian anxiously asked.

“Of course,” Long Chengyu replied.

“Young master, this…”

“I have the right to make the call on this.”

“But God Armaments are important assets of our Totem Dragon Clan. Outsiders aren’t allowed to take them away without the clan chief’s permission,” Long Kuitian said with a frown.

Eggy looked at Long Kuitian and sneered, “That old fellow chose to speak those words aloud when he could have discreetly reminded Long Chengyu. It’s obvious that he’s telling you that you aren’t welcome. He’s afraid that you’d take their God Armament away. How stingy!”

Chu Feng didn’t respond. He could understand where Long Kuitian was coming from, especially with how valuable God Armaments were.

“I doubt that anyone will dare to defy me on this matter,” Long Chengyu said.

“But young master…” Long Kuitian protested.

“Elder Tian.”

Long Chengyu’s tone suddenly turned sharp as he directed a severe glance at Long Kuitian. This was a sign that he was starting to lose his patience.

Long Kuitian hurriedly shut his mouth.

“Brother Chu Feng, it’s rare for me to extend an invitation to others. This is the first time I am inviting a junior. You wouldn’t snub my goodwill, right?” Long Chengyu turned to Chu Feng and spoke with an earnest smile.

“Is it truly fine for me to enter your clan’s Armory Hall?” Chu Feng asked.

“Brother Chu Feng, I’ll be frank with you because I don’t see you as an outsider. It’s true that God Armaments are extremely valuable. Powerhouses wouldn’t hesitate to put their lives on the line for a God Armament.

“I am extending this invitation to you not just because you have saved my life but because I trust your potential too. I strongly believe that your value will far surpass that of a God Armament in the near future. Consider this an investment on my part. Of course, you’ll have to work hard to make a God Armament submit to you too. If you don’t have that much in you, I’m afraid to say that you aren’t qualified to take possession of our God Armament. Ultimately, it still depends on you,” Long Chengyu said.

“I’ll humbly accept your offer then,” Chu Feng said.

He noticed Long Kuitian’s complexion turning even more awful upon hearing his words, and he knew that there would be many more Totem Dragon Clansmen who opposed his entry to their Armory Hall too. But why should he allow a precious opportunity to earn a God Armament slip past his fingers just because he was concerned with what others think?

He knew that Long Chengyu was doing him a favor, and he would make sure to repay it if he obtained a God Armament here. Even if he failed, he would have no regrets since he had at least given it a try.

Long Chengyu wasn’t surprised by Chu Feng’s acceptance. He turned to Long Muxi and asked, “Big sister, it’s a rare opportunity. Why don’t you come back as well?”

He looked a little nervous when he said those words. Long Suqing, Long Kuitian, and the World Spiritist Painter tensed up as well.

Long Muxi ignored Long Chengyu, instead choosing to turn to Long Suqing and say, “Aunt, let’s head back then.”

“All right.”

Long Suqing widened her eyes before a delighted smile formed on her face. It was the same for Long Chengyu too. Even Long Kuitian, who was previously displeased that Chu Feng would be entering the Totem Dragon Clan’s Armory Hall, also revealed a smile.

“Brother, I have to thank you for this.” Long Chengyu sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.

“What do you mean?” Chu Feng replied via voice transmission.

“You should have noticed by now that my big sister is estranged from our clan. She wouldn’t have willingly returned to our clan under normal circumstances. I can tell that she’s only coming along because she’s worried that you’d be bullied by the others,” Long Chengyu said.

“Oh? Could the matter you mentioned earlier be…” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, I needed your help to persuade my big sister to return to our clan. This year’s opening of the Armory Hall is different from those in previous years. It took us a lot of effort to make it happen, and it’s a rare opportunity for her too. It’s just that my big sister is an awfully obstinate person, as you probably can tell.

“I can tell that you have a special place in my big sister’s heart, so I thought that she might listen to your words. To be frank, I also didn’t expect things would work out so smoothly. I really have to thank you for this,” Long Chengyu said.

“May I ask what’s the conflict between Miss Muxi and your clan?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s really just a misunderstanding,” Long Chengyu replied with a sigh.

Chu Feng could tell that Long Chengyu was unwilling to broach this topic, so he tactfully chose not to probe any further.

“Chu Feng, doesn’t it sound like Miss Bai has feelings for you?” Eggy asked with a mischievous gleam in her eyes.

“It’s nothing like that. She’s the type of person who rarely opens her heart to others, and it just so happens that she sees me as a friend,” Chu Feng replied with a tinge of guilt.

Based on his past interactions with Long Muxi, he could tell that she was a reasonable person even though she often put on a cold exterior. She must have suffered a lot of grievances for her to decide to distance herself from the Totem Dragon Clan.

Her decision to return signified her intention to lower her head to them and reconcile, but it didn’t seem like she had forgiven the Totem Dragon Clan yet.

“Miss Muxi, did you choose to return to the Totem Dragon Clan because of me?” Chu Feng sent a voice transmission over to Long Muxi.

He would rather not visit the Totem Dragon Clan’s Armory Hall if that was the case. No matter how valuable God Armaments were, it was nowhere as important as his friends. It hadn’t been long since he was acquainted with Long Muxi, but he already saw the latter as his friend.

He didn’t want to put her in a spot for his sake.

“Don’t think too much into it, Chu Feng. I simply figured that it was about time for me to resolve my grudges against my clan. You have nothing to do with my decision to return. Besides, the opening of the Armory Hall is indeed a rare opportunity. You should tightly grasp it,” Long Muxi replied.

With all that had been said, Chu Feng nodded and replied, “All right. Let’s head to the Totem Dragon Clan together.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Long Kuitian first stepped out of the All Lives Are Equal Palace and announced to the crowd that this matter had been resolved. He grabbed Jia Lingyi with the intention of bringing her back to the Totem Dragon Clan to be questioned, though Long Chengyu promised Chu Feng that he would keep her alive.

Chu Feng followed the group to the Totem Dragon Clan.

Those outside the All Lives Are Equal Palace continued to linger in the area, as they continued to fervently discuss the earlier events.

As for the World Spiritist Painter, he returned to the All Lives Are Equal Palace and headed toward the hall where the monster was sealed. He first looked at the opened gate and smiled to himself before turning his eyes toward another painting.

It was Qing Xuantian’s painting.

As he walked up to the painting, his attitude visibly changed. He revealed deference that he didn’t even show to those from the Totem Dragon Clan.

“Lord Xuantian, I met a formidable junior from your galaxy. I have no doubt that he’ll accomplish great things in the future. He’s curious about you, but he doesn’t seem to be your descendant since he goes by the surname of ‘Chu’. I’m dying to know what kind of relationship exists between the two of you, but I obeyed your order and divulged nothing about you.

“I wonder if you’re still doing fine. Our Dragon Breath Clan has met with some trouble. If only you’re still around…”

The World Spiritist Painter’s voice slowly trailed off, knowing that the other party was unable to hear his words. Powerless to salvage the situation, he could only murmur under his breath.
