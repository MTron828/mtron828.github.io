Chapter 4466: The Summoning of Bloodline

“Little benefactor, allow me to accompany you. I’ll listen to your words and not cause you any trouble,” Long Xiaoxiao quickly stepped forward and said.

“You promise?” Chu Feng asked.

“I promise.”

Long Xiaoxiao raised her small hands as she put on a solemn expression. Her serious attitude looked rather adorable.

“Since that’s the case, I want you to head back to where your father is right now and wait for me out here. Don’t follow me. Otherwise, I’ll be getting angry,” Chu Feng said with a severe look on his face, almost as if a parent disciplining a child.

He rarely put on such a look before Long Xiaoxaio

Seeing such a severe Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao immediately cowered out, “Alright alright, I’ll return. Don’t get angry at me. I only came here with you out of worry. You mustn’t get angry at me over this!”

Long Xiaoxiao quickly turned around and returned back through the entrance.

Even as she left, she kept turning her head around to look at Chu Feng with eyes filled with reluctance.

Chu Feng noticed the little gazes that Long Xiaoxiao was shooting his way, and he couldn’t help but sigh deeply. How could he not know the reason why Long Xiaoxiao was insisting on tagging along with him?

Someone as smart as Long Xiaoxiao was bound to know how dangerous it was to enter the mountain range and get involved with the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

She was following him only because she was worried about him.

But similarly, Chu Feng was also worried about her too, so he had to make her leave.

This was a situation where even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief and the other powerhouses amongst them dared not to move easily. While Chu Feng had decided to make a move, he had no intention of implicating anyone else with him.

“Hurry up and go. Wait outside for me obediently!” Chu Feng waved to Long Xiaoxiao, who kept directing longing gazes toward him, and a slight smile finally broke out on his stern face.

Seeing that smile, the downcast look on Long Xiaoxiao’s face finally blossomed into a brilliant smile once more.

“You must return safely!”

Long Xiaoxiao said those words before she finally left the area with an ease of mind. Before long, she vanished from Chu Feng’s sight.

After ensuring that Long Xiaoxiao was gone, Chu Feng finally began making his way further into the mountain range. Instead of searching for that so-called spirit beast, he headed straight in a certain direction, as if he had already decided on where he wanted to go.

From the moment he entered the mountain range, he could already feel his blood bubbling in fervor. It felt as if something was resonating with his blood, trying to summon him.

Facing this peculiar situation, Chu Feng had a strong feeling that this resonation was coming from the hidden place. After all, that was the place that could possibly contain his grandfather’s trails.

Otherwise, he couldn’t think of any reason why he would experience a blood resonation at a place like this.

This made Chu Feng extremely excited. In truth, he wasn’t concerned about whether he could obtain anything good from the hidden place. Rather, he was more concerned about whether he was able to find clues concerning his grandfather form the hidden place.

In order to avoid stumbling into any unnecessary trouble in the midst of his search, Chu Feng used his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and spirit power simultaneously to conceal himself so that no one would be able to sense him.

In truth, this mountain range wasn’t too big either. The bubbling feeling in his bloodline grew stronger and stronger the further he proceeded into the mountain range, and when he finally stopped his footsteps, he was already standing in the midst of barren land.

This mountain range was generally lush with greenery, and there were all sorts of unique animals that inhabited this region. Yet, at the current area where Chu Feng was standing at, there were only weeds to be seen.

Not only so, but it was also harnessed very little natural energies too. Even animals wouldn’t be willing to rest at a place like this.

Due to this, there was hardly anyone from the Zhao Clan to be seen in this area. They thought that it was impossible for the spirit beast to hide at a place like this. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Nevertheless, Chu Feng still didn’t let his guard down. He carefully scanned his surroundings to ensure that no one was around before he finally proceeded further down to the foot of a mountain.

The weeds thriving at the foot of the mountain were exceptionally high, most of them towering at a height of tens of meters tall. It looks almost like a jungle.

Passing through this jungle of tall weeds, Chu Feng soon discovered a cavern.

At first glance, this cavern looked perfectly ordinary. There was nothing peculiar to be noted about it. However, as soon as Chu Feng entered the cavern, not only did his blood suddenly start running furiously, but even his goosebumps also rose up instinctively.

The blood resonance he felt was reaching its peak.

He quickly proceeded ahead, and soon, he arrived at the deepest area of the cavern.

All that could be seen in this deepest area were just stones. There was nothing special at all.

However, when Chu Feng approached the dead end of the cavern a little closer, a mystical glow suddenly imbued the surface of the wall at the very end. Runes began to appear

These runes were organized in neat rows, and they covered the entire wall at the end like murals.

It was a mystifying yet beautiful sight.

Seeing the runes, Chu Feng’s heart beat even more wildly in excitement.

He had seen similar looking runes on the map provided by the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief too. This convinced him that he had just found a clue leading to the hidden place.

So, he began to carefully examine the runes, hoping to decipher the way to enter the hidden place from it.

Weng!

But all of a sudden, the glowing light on the wall began to whirl together, converging to form a spirit formation gate on its own accord.

Seeing this, Chu Feng quickly entered the spirit formation gate without any hesitation.

What he saw on the other side of the spirit formation gate left him feeling so agitated inside that no words could describe his current emotions. It was a brand new world on the other side.

He found himself standing in the midst of a passageway of a humongous divine hall.

While it was called a passageway, its size was more like a palace in itself. It was thousands of meters wide, such that over ten thousand people could stand shoulder to shoulder along its width

Its height was even more astounding, its ceiling standing at a hundred thousand meters tall. If there were clouds inside this divine hall, they would have floated beneath the ceiling.

The walls and ground of this passageway were forged using copper bricks. Every single one of these copper bricks was elaborately designed that it could pass off as a work of art by itself. Yet, countless of them filled up this divine hall.

And last but not least, this place was overflowing with the aura of the Ancient Era.

Was this hidden place a remnant left behind from the Ancient Era too?

Weng!

But while Chu Feng was still marveling at this impressive passageway, a sound suddenly echoed from the spirit formation gate behind him.

Turning around, he saw two figures walking out of the spirit formation gate.

Boom!

Before he could even take a closer look, a formidable might had already gushed in his direction, forcing him down onto the ground.

It was the oppressive might coming from a Martial Exalted level cultivator whose prowess far surpassed that of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

In other words, the people who had just arrived were far beyond his means to deal with.

Even though Chu Feng’s body was pinned to the ground, he was still able to turn his head sideways to take a closer look at the two people who had just entered this place.

They were unfamiliar faces to him.

The two of them shared similar appearances, making them look deeply reminiscent of twins. Their appearances were extremely feral, especially since their faces were filled with sword scars. This showed that they were veterans who had been through numerous dangerous situations.

Through their wrinkled faces, Chu Feng was able to tell they were advanced in age.

However, their eyes were filled not with the amiableness of an elder but a streak of savagery that was even more terrifying than that of monstrous beasts. There was unconcealable air of malevolence in the depths of their eyes that only those who had taken the lives of many would have.

With just a look at them, Chu Feng could tell that they were definitely no easy foe to deal with!
