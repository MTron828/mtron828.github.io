Chapter 3710 - Battle God’s Halberd

“Liangqiu, you’re losing your head. Four hours still haven’t passed yet, why so anxious?” old man Zhu asked.

“Brother Zhu, this matter concerns two lives. You don’t have to be this harsh, no?” asked Grandmaster Liangqiu.

“I said four hours, so it’s going to be four hours.” Old man Zhu’s attitude was extremely firm.

“Then we’ll continue to wait. Chu Feng has managed to withstand it for so long, a short moment longer wouldn’t make much difference,” said Grandmaster Liangqiu.

Although he couldn’t see the conditions within the Gate of Death, he was focused on old man Zhu’s expression the entire time.

Because of that, Grandmaster Liangqiu knew that Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa were still alive.

“That boy is indeed very capable. However, don’t forget that he’s carrying a burden.”

“For the sake of protecting that burden, that boy has decided to simultaneously endure twice the amount of power.”

“Currently, he is on the verge of being unable to endure. If I do not go down, he will definitely not be able to survive,” said old man Zhu.

“Ah?” Hearing those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s expression changed greatly.

“Senior, I beg of you, please save them.” Gu Mingyuan’s voice was heard.

She was too worried about Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa. Thus, as she spoke, she was moving to kneel before old man Zhu.

“There’s no need for that.”

Before Gu Mingyuan could kneel, old man Zhu stopped her.

“Girl, do not be this overly courteous every time. This old man cannot accept such courtesy.” laughed old man Zhu.

After he finished saying those words, he looked to Grandmaster Liangqiu. “Liangqiu, what you said is correct. That boy is indeed a talent. I will give you face and help him this one time.”

“However, since the Gate of Death has already closed, I will not be able to enter it.”

“I can only enter the deepest place in the Mirror Sea, the Mirror Core. Through the power of the Mirror Core, I will be able to ease the power of the Gate of Death.”

Upon hearing those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu’s expression changed greatly. “Mirror Core? Must you enter that place?”

Grandmaster Liangqiu knew very well that there were multiple dangerous places in the Mirror Sea. The Gate of Death could be said to be one of them.

However, the most dangerous place among them would be the Mirror Core. The Mirror Core was a place that even he couldn’t reach.

“There’s nothing that I can do about that. After all, I’ve agreed that I’ll help that kid.”

“Although I will be able to decrease the power of the Gate of Death after entering the Mirror Core, I will have to pay a price for it.”

“The price is that I will be trapped in the Mirror Core. Of course, I will try my best to escape from it.”

“Thus, Liangqiu, if I am able to return alive within seventy-nine days, that would be for the best.”

“However, if I do not return alive within seventy-nine days, have that boy search for me.”

“If it’s that boy, he might actually be able to save me.”

“Remember, seventy-nine days shall be the time limit. Do not attempt to search for me before seventy-nine days have passed.”

“After seventy-nine days,” he coughed, “if you have a conscience, tell that boy to come save me.”

After he finished saying those words, water splashed into the sky. Old man Zhu had entered the Mirror Sea, and made a straight line downward for the depths of the Mirror Sea.

At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu had a very ashamed and guilt-ridden look on his face.

It would be one thing if Old Man Zhu were to enter other places. However, if it was the Mirror Core, he might actually end up dying. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although he did not hope for Chu Feng to die, he also did not wish for his old friend to die because of him.

Because of that, he firmly remembered the number seventy-nine.

......

Chu Feng did not know what had happened outside.

He had lost consciousness from the torment brought on by the power of the undercurrent. He no longer knew the passage of time.

After an unknown period of time had passed, Chu Feng’s consciousness began to recover. He was able to sense that the power tormenting him had disappeared.

Furthermore, it had completely disappeared.

Chu Feng opened his eyes and discovered that he was still in the Mirror Sea. Indestructible rocks still covered both the area above and the area below him.

Chu Xuanzhengfa was beside him. His hand was tightly gripping Chu Xuanzhengfa’s left arm. Chu Feng was still imbuing power into Chu Xuanzhengfa’s body nonstop. He seemed to have not stopped protecting Chu Xuanzhengfa even when he was unconscious.

That said, although everything had returned to normal now, the Mirror Sea was acting very abnormally.

Not only had the undercurrent that was torturing them disappeared, but the surging waves had also disappeared.

The current Mirror Sea was as tranquil as its surface. It was so tranquil that it felt strange.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, an aura appeared in the Mirror Sea.

That aura felt very divine. Sensing that divine aura, Chu Feng’s heartbeat accelerated.

Even though the undercurrent that had brought harm to Chu Feng had disappeared from the Mirror Sea, his Heaven’s Eyes were still ineffective there.

Due to that, Chu Feng was unable to search for the source of that aura. If he wanted to find the source, he would have to slowly move onward.

After proceeding for some distance, Chu Feng was surprised to discover that a large piece of rock from the rocks that blocked the path below had disappeared.

Below was still seawater, pitch-black and bottomless seawater.

However, Chu Feng clearly remembered that he had passed by this region while searching for an exit earlier.

At that time, the rocks there were still completely intact. There was no bottomless seawater at all.

Chu Feng had a faint feeling that things were very abnormal, that something was definitely fishy.

However, that aura was simply too divine. It seemed to be summoning him. Chu Feng was unable to resist that power at all.

“Senior, I don’t know if this journey onward will be good or bad. I cannot bring you with me.”

Chu Feng placed Chu Xuanzhengfa on the rock and left a brief note telling him to not move around and wait for him there.

The reason why Chu Feng did that was because that place was simply too big, and his various observation abilities were all ineffective.

Chu Feng was afraid that Chu Xuanzhengfa would wander off to seek him after waking up.

After leaving the note, Chu Feng did not directly enter that bottomless region of seawater.

He did not know whether or not danger awaited below. Thus, to prevent Chu Xuanzhengfa from following him, Chu Feng set up a concealment formation.

Not only was Chu Feng’s spirit formation capable of concealing the bottomless region of seawater, but it was also able to seal off that divine aura.

After making his preparations, Chu Feng entered that region of seawater.

The further down he went, the stronger that divine aura became.

At the beginning, it was pitch-black, but gradually, brightness appeared below.

The light grew stronger and stronger. Later on, the bottom grew brightly lit.

Chu Feng was able to see the dazzling silver light was being emitted by a weapon.

The weapon was silver all around. It was thirteen meters long, and had the shape of a halberd.

It looked like an ordinary halberd. However, the aura it emitted was simply incomparable.

Chu Feng was unable to tell what quality of a weapon the halberd was. Being placed there, it did not resemble a weapon at all.

From his current distance, Chu Feng was not only able to sense the sacred aura, but he was also able to sense that the weapon emitted an invincible air of superiority.

It was truly the aura of a ruler. That weapon was not only a king among weapons, but it was also the king of that entire place.

“Could it be, that’s the legendary Battle God’s Halberd?”

Seeing the weapon below and feeling the aura emitted by it, the first thing that came to Chu Feng’s mind was the treasure of the Mirror Sea, the Battle God’s Halberd.
