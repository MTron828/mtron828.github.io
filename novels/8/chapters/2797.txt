Chapter 2797 - Breakthrough To Dragon Mark

“This young miss cannot miss out on this great show.”

Chu Lingxi slanted her mouth upwards. Then, her delicate body moved. She dove after Xia Yun’er.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had indeed successfully made his breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.

He had succeeded. Furthermore, it was not only in terms of making a breakthrough.

As Chu Feng had anticipated, after he successfully broke through, Chu Feng’s injured spirit power was also completely healed.

The current Chu Feng was wild with joy, immersed in happiness.

After all, to Chu Feng, these were two joyous things happening simultaneously. Not only did he manage to reach a breakthrough, he’d also cured his injury that was deemed to be incurable.

To kill two birds with one stone, how could one not be overjoyed?

“This feeling.”

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s smiling face turned serious. He raised his head and looked upward. Upon doing so, his expression immediately changed.

“It’s that girl Xia Yun’er. It must have been because of my body involuntarily releasing my Dragon Mark Immortal-level spirit power as I broke through to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. That must’ve caught that girl’s attention,” Chu Feng said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“In that case, why are you still standing here? Quickly, flee,” Her Lady Queen urged.

After the confrontation earlier, Her Lady Queen felt that the current Chu Feng would not be a match for Xia Yun’er.

Furthermore, Xia Yun’er was determined to kill Chu Feng. If Chu Feng was to be defeated, he would be killed.

In those conditions, it would be better to choose to flee than to engage in a difficult fight against Xia Yun’er head-on.

“Where to?” Chu Feng asked.

“Flee downwards. Where else? Up towards her?” Her Lady Queen said.

Chu Feng hesitated for a moment. However, soon after, his body moved, and a burst of water splashed upwards. Chu Feng had turned into a ray of light. Like a dragon diving into the water, he shot straight down towards the depths of Buried Spirit Lake.

Unfortunately, Xia Yun’er’s speed was truly fast. Her speed was actually much faster than Chu Feng’s speed. Thus, she was growing closer and closer to him. It was so much so that Chu Feng could see her silhouette when he turned his head around to look behind him.

That being said, what Chu Feng was feeling the most at that moment would be Xia Yun’er’s killing intent.

That killing intent was so strong that it caused Chu Feng to involuntarily sneeze. It would appear that that girl was truly determined to kill him.

Chu Feng knew that the reason why Xia Yun’er was so fast was because she had used her Divine Power as well as her Incomplete Immortal Armaments.

In such a situation, Chu Feng did not dare to hesitate. He immediately activated his Divine Lightning, took out his Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler and unleashed his Ancient Era’s War Sword and Ancient Era’s War Axe. He unleashed all of the methods that he possessed to increase his battle power.

Chu Feng was truly forced into a corner. If he didn’t unleash all those methods, he would soon be overtaken by Xia Yun’er.

“Chu Feng, today, only death awaits you! You will not be able to escape!!!”

Xia Yun’er’s sharp voice exploded from behind Chu Feng. From her voice, one could tell how much she detested Chu Feng.

“Girl, isn’t it just having a glance at your naked body? You still haven’t calmed your anger yet?” Chu Feng asked as he continued to flee.

“You shut up! I will definitely kill you!” Xia Yun’er shouted furiously.

“I get it now. You’re afraid that I will speak of this matter to others. How about this. I, Chu Feng, guarantee you that I will absolutely not mention this matter to anyone. If you are still angry, I will apologize to you, okay?”

“Although it wasn’t my intention, it remains that I’ve seen it. Thus, I am able to accept apologizing to you,” Chu Feng said.

“You!!!” Hearing those words, Xia Yun’er was so enraged that her furious red face turned white. This was not the white to describe one’s fair skin. Rather, it was a deathly pale whiteness of someone with no trace of blood in their skin.

At that moment, Xia Yun’er stopped saying anything. However, her speed was growing increasingly faster, and her killing intent grew increasingly stronger.

Waves emerged from where she passed. Those waves of water crashed violently onto the lake’s rock walls. They were truly powerful.

“Come then. If we are to continue downward, we will soon enter that forbidden region. If you continue to chase after me, the two of us shall die together,” although Xia Yun’er was quiet, Chu Feng’s mouth was running nonstop.

Chu Feng was not trying to scare Xia Yun’er with his words. Rather, it was the truth.

Buried Spirit Lake was very dangerous. Practically all those who dared to enter into the depths of Buried Spirit Lake ended up dying.

This was also the reason why Chu Feng was hesitant when Her Lady Queen told him to continue to dive downward.

After all, Chu Feng had already dove very far down in order to escape from Xia Yun’er. If he was to continue to dive downward, Chu Feng would have no idea when he passed the boundary to death itself.

“Those waters?”

After diving down for a bit longer, Chu Feng discovered that the water below him had changed color.

The lakewater in that region was actually dark green. At a glance, it looked truly frightening. It was simply akin to hell itself.

“Fuck. Am I about to enter that region of death?” Chu Feng realized that the situation was bad.

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng did not slow down. He directly entered the region of water that could be seen to be very dangerous with one’s naked eye.

Chu Feng had no other choice. After all, pursuing relentlessly behind him was a murderous-looking Xia Yun’er who was determined to kill him.

Seeing Chu Feng entering that region of water, Xia Yun’er was not to be outdone either. Without reducing her speed, she dove after Chu Feng.

“If you continue to chase after him, you’ll be throwing your life away.”

Right at that moment, a voice sounded from behind Xia Yun’er. It was Chu Lingxi.

“Woosh~~~”

Xia Yun’er reacted as if she had been woken up by Chu Lingxi’s voice. Immediately, she stopped diving after Chu Feng.

“This is that boundary?” Xia Yun’er asked.

“I’m not sure either. However, we dove deep enough. If it had been before, those seniors would definitely not have allowed us to enter this deep.”

“Regardless, the origin of Buried Spirit Lake’s name is not merely a legend. Its name was truly formed by the piling up of countless seniors’ remains.”

“Furthermore, I believe you’ve sensed it too. The body of water down below is emitting a very threatening aura. It is most definitely more frightening than it appears to be.”

“Thus, I urge you to not continue diving downward. Else, if you are to encounter some sort of mishap, your gains will not make up for the losses,” Chu Lingxi urged.

At that moment, Xia Yun’er grew silent. A short moment after, she said to Chu Lingxi, “Thank you, Lady Chu Lingxi.”

“I was muddled by my murderous desire earlier. If it wasn’t for your call to attention, I might’ve really dove after Chu Feng.”

Chu Lingxi smiled at Xia Yun’er’s thanks.

Then, she said, “I know that you’re feeling very unreconciled. However, Chu Feng has entered where he shouldn’t have. He most likely will not survive. Moreover, it was you who chased him down there. Thus, if he is to really die there, it could be said that you killed him and obtained your revenge.”

“That guy possesses a very strong lifeforce. Even though he has dove deep into Buried Spirit Lake, he might not necessarily die. Thus, I will stay here and keep a lookout for him,” Xia Yun’er said.

Even though he knew that Xia Yun’er had not chased after him, Chu Feng was still slowly diving in that region of water.

On the one hand, Chu Feng was afraid that Xia Yun’er would suddenly chase after him. Thus, he wanted to maintain as much distance as possible.

On the other hand, Chu Feng had not only felt a bone-chilling, ice-cold and extremely dangerous sensation after entering that region of water, but he was also able to faintly hear anguished wailings.

It seemed that there were people crying, people screaming and magnificent armies fighting in close quarters. Regardless, the sounds that he was hearing from deep down underwater were truly horrifying.

However, if that were all there was, Chu Feng would definitely not continue to brave dangers and dive deeper.

The reason why Chu Feng continued to dive downward was because he felt an extremely dense amount of natural energies after entering that deep and dark region of water. Moreover, the further he descended, the stronger the natural energies became.

It was as if the bottom of Buried Spirit Lake was the fountainhead of the natural energies. It was as if it contained an unimaginably vast amount of energies tempting people.

It was no wonder people would say that the depths of the Buried Spirit Lake possessed treasures unknown to anyone.
