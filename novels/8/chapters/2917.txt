Chapter 2917 - Truly Grand Gamble

“Humph,” Song Yunfei snorted coldly.

He no longer said anything. However, he was so furious his eyes had turned red.

After all, Chu Feng’s words were openly mocking him.

That said, while he was angry, Song Yunfei soon revealed an expression of taking joy in another’s misfortune.

After competing against Jinshi Bo, he had recognized Jinshi Bo’s strength.

That said, Song Yunfei was certain that Chu Feng was no match for him.

Thus, he felt that Chu Feng would definitely end up losing.

He was waiting to enjoy a show, waiting to watch how Chu Feng would be defeated.

If Chu Feng also ended up being miserably defeated, it would not only be him, Song Yunfei, that would be disgraced. To Song Yunfei, this was good.

“In that case, are you really planning to gamble with me? That said, you should’ve lost quite a bit earlier, no? Do you still have Immortal Martial Stones to gamble with?” Jinshi Bo asked.

Chu Feng smiled lightly at Jinshi Bo’s words. He said, “I do have Immortal Martial Stones. I’m only afraid that you can’t afford to take me on.”

“Haha, what a joke. There’s actually someone who dares to declare that I, Jinshi Bo, is unable to afford Immortal Martial Stones?” Jinshi Bo started to laugh loudly.

However, when Chu Feng said the following words, Jinshi Bo’s laugher froze.

“Ten million Immortal Martial Stones per attempt. Do you dare accept that?”

“What? Ten million Immortal Martial Stones?”

Hearing those words, the crowd all opened their mouths wide in shock. They simply did not dare to believe their ears.

Even Jinshi Bo and the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder revealed stunned expressions.

Ten million Immortal Martial Stones was simply an amount that one would not be able to not be shocked by.

That said, after being stunned momentarily, Jinshi Bo suddenly burst into loud laughter. He said, “Ten million Immortal Martial Stones? Who are you trying to frighten? If you are capable of taking out such an amount, I will gamble against you. The only thing I fear is that you’re unable to take out such an amount, that you’re just boasting.”

That’s right, boasting. Likely, Jinshi Bo was not the only person amongst the crowd that felt that Chu Feng was boasting.

Several hundred thousand or a million Immortal Martial Stones was an amount that the people present would believe. After all, Chu Feng was not an ordinary individual.

However, ten million Immortal Martial Stones per gamble was simply too ridiculous. It was not that the crowd didn’t want to believe it. Rather, it was simply too difficult to believe.

“Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, can you not continue to make a show of yourself like this? What you’re doing not only humiliates yourself, you’re also humiliating our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, do you know that?”

Song Yunfei even began to criticize Chu Feng in a righteous manner. It was as if he was already certain that Chu Feng would not be able to take out that many Immortal Martial Stones.

It was normal for him to be skeptical of Chu Feng. After all, Song Yunfei, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Son, had come prepared to participate in the Grand Auction Assembly. However, the amount of Immortal Martial Stones he had brought was only a bit over two million.

Yet, Chu Feng actually said that he would bet ten million Immortal Martial Stones from the get-go. If this wasn’t boasting, what was?

Not to mention it being Chu Feng, it was likely that only a few people among all of the people that came to participate in the Grand Auction Assembly would be capable of taking out ten million Immortal Martial Stones.

However, at this moment when everyone thought that Chu Feng was boasting, Chu Feng waved his sleeve. In an instant, golden light filled the sky, covering it completely.

“Heavens, those are...!”

Looking up, the crowd present were all stupefied.

The reason for that was because the golden light that filled the sky were all Immortal Martial Stones. Their number was simply too excessive, so excessive that they covered the sky completely.

Upon careful counting, there were precisely ten million Immortal Martial Stones.

Chu Feng actually really possessed ten million Immortal Martial Stones.

“This...?”

At that moment, Song Yunfei was dumbstruck. Earlier, he had declared that Chu Feng was boasting, and felt that Chu Feng was making a show of himself.

However, Chu feng actually really managed to take out ten million Immortal Martial Stones with a wave of his hand.

At that moment, Song Yunfei felt his scalp going numb. There was a burning pain on his face.

It turned out that Chu Feng was not boasting. Rather, it was he, Song Yunfei, whose horizons were too narrow.

In fact, even the Martial Immortal-level experts present had astonished expressions on their faces. All the crowd were stunned as they looked at the ten million Immortal Martial Stones before them.

Among the people in the crowd, it was actually only Xia Yun’er who was relatively calm.

However, even she, the calmest person in the crowd, opened her little mouth slightly. This meant that she too was very astonished.

After being astonished, the crowd came to a sudden realization.

It was no wonder Chu Feng dared to propose an increase of the gambling stake to a hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones when he was gambling against Song Yunfei.

It turned out that it was not that Chu Feng had gone mad, rather it was because he was sufficiently wealthy.

To someone who brought forth ten million Immortal Martial Stones with a wave of his hand, a hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones really would not amount to much.

Although the crowd were all astonished by Chu Feng after he took out ten million Immortal Martial Stones, Chu Feng’s gaze was focused on only a single person -- Jinshi Bo.

At that moment, Jinshi Bo’s complexion had turned deathly pale. This was the first time Chu Feng had seen him reveal such an expression on his face.

It would appear that no matter how conceited and egotistical someone was, they would still have a weakness. As long as one could bring forth a sufficient amount of strength, their conceit would only turn into panic.

“Prince Jinshi, I have taken out ten million Immortal Martial Stones as you’ve requested. It’s your turn now.”

“Of course, if you’re unable to take out ten million Immortal Martial Stones, I can lower the gambling stake,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng’s ‘lower the gambling stake,’ sounded very mocking. He was simply looking down on Jinshi Bo.

“What a joke. How could I, the prince of the Goldenstone Royal Clan, not be able to take out a mere ten million Immortal Martial Stones?” Jinshi Bo laughed coldly.

Then, he turned to the Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder behind him, “Elder Yuhua, give me that Cosmos Sack.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Lil Bo, you mustn’t be impulsive. That is...” The Goldenstone Royal Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder seemed to want to advise Jinshi Bo against it.

“Hand it to me!” Jinshi Bo narrowed his eyebrows and spoke with anger in his voice.

Under this sort of situation, that Utmost Exalted Elder said no more. He took out a Cosmos Sack and handed it to Jinshi Bo.

It could be seen that Jinshi Bo was someone who held quite some status in the Goldenstone Royal Clan. Otherwise, how could an Utmost Exalted Elder fear a member of the younger generation like him?

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Jinshi Bo waved his sleeve. Then, a vast amount of golden light covered the sky above him like a golden cloud.

Those were precisely ten million Immortal Martial Stones.

“Your name is Chu Feng, right? I will have you remember my name today,” Jinshi Bo said.

“Why?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“Because I am going to be the person who will win those ten million Immortal Martial Stones from you,” Jinshi Bo said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. That smile of his was filled with contempt.

“Humph,” Jinshi Bo snorted coldly.

Then, he pointed to the third floor’s thousand meter-tall Black Crystal Stone that pierced through the clouds.
