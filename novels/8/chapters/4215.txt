Chapter 4215 - Chu Feng’s Defeat

“Heeahh!”

Suddenly, Li Fengxue shouted. Then, he pushed forth both of his palms.

“Roar---”

In an instant, golden-bright and dazzling ferocious beasts surged forth from his spirit formation and charged toward Chu Feng.

Every one of those golden-bright and dazzling ferocious beasts were several hundred meters long. As for their numbers, there were simply too many to count.

Standing there, Chu Feng appeared extremely small.

The sight was like a group of elephants attacking an ant.

“Li Fengxue!”

Seeing that, Yuan Shu cried out in his heart.

It was not because the spirit formation that Li Fengxue had set up was excessively strong.

Instead, it was because the agreed time between Chu Feng and Li Fengxue had not yet arrived when Li Fengxue unleashed his attack.

It was simply violating the rules.

After all, it was still not the time they had agreed upon.

If Chu Feng hadn’t finished setting up his spirit formation yet, it would mean that Li Fengxue’s attack could cause fatal damage to Chu Feng.

“Perfect timing.”

But, at practically the same moment when Li Fengxue unleashed his attack, Chu Feng let out an indifferent smile.

“Wave, surge forth!” Chu Feng shouted, and the spirit formation before him started surging with waves.

The golden-bright and dazzling waves soared into the sky and formed massive wave walls over a thousand meters in height. In successive layers, the waves surged toward Li Fengxue.

Before the enormous waves, even Li Fengxue’s giant spirit formation beasts became extremely small.

“Roar---”

Soon, roars were heard. The giant spirit formation beasts were being swallowed by the enormous waves, and began to howl in grief as they struggled to escape. Some failed to withstand the power of the waves, and were reduced into spirit power that scattered away.

“This guy!”

Li Fengxue was surprised to see such a thing. He had not expected Chu Feng’s spirit formation to be so powerful.

This had far surpassed his expectations.

He had thought the young man to be inferior to even Yuan Shu. Because of that, he had not paid any attention to Chu Feng.

That said, whilst Li Fengxue was surprised by his spirit formation being destroyed by Chu Feng’s spirit formation, he was not afraid. With a thought, he shouted loudly.

“Buzz---”

In the next instant, his slaughtering formation had started to shine even brighter and runes and symbols began circulating throughout his spirit formation.

The giant spirit formation beasts flying out from his spirit formation became even stronger than before.

The giant spirit formation beasts from earlier had only known how to attack using their most primitive methods. The giant spirit formation beasts’ at that moment were no longer the same.

With their mouths wide open, they were releasing strong wind that stopped Chu Feng’s giant waves.

That said, Chu Feng was not worried either. He began urging his spirit formation with his full strength.

Just like that, wind and wave, two different powers, were pitted against one another.

They were actually at a stalemate.

At that moment, Revered Master Beast Tamer turned to ask Grandmaster Tang Chen. “That kid, what’s his name?”

“Was it Chu Feng?”

“Whose disciple is he?”

“I’m afraid I cannot tell you that,” Grandmaster Tang Chen said with a smile.

He was able to tell that Revered Master Beast Tamer had gained a whole new opinion of Chu Feng.

Earlier, he had looked down on Chu Feng. The only reason why he’d agreed to have Li Fengxue compete against Chu Feng was purely because he wanted his Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

He must’ve thought that Chu Feng’s Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain was readily obtainable.

It was only at that moment that he discovered that he had completely underestimated how.

The Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain was not as easily obtained as he had anticipated.

After all, Chu Feng’s had managed to reach a stalemate against his disciple’s spirit formation. That was enough to prove that Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist with rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.

“Brother Tang Chen, that kid couldn’t possibly still be a person of the younger generation, right?”

Although Grandmaster Tang Chen hadn’t answered his earlier question, Revered Master Beast Tamer continued to pester him with questions.

“Can’t you tell yourself?” Grandmaster Tang Chen asked in return with a beaming smile.

Revered Master Beast Tamer was a very powerful world spiritist. Like Grandmaster Tang Chen, he was someone that had grasped rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation.

It was impossible that a world spiritist of his caliber could not tell how old Chu Feng was. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It was just that he was unwilling to believe it to be true.

If Chu Feng was truly a person of the younger generation, it would mean that he was even more talented than Li Fengxue.

After all, his disciple’s age was similar to Yuan Shu’s. Both of them were no longer people of the younger generation.

“He’s actually really a person of the younger generation.”

Sure enough, after hearing Grandmaster Tang Chen’s words, Revered Master Beast Tamer’s gaze grew complicated.

The immense pride he had felt earlier had been replaced with slight depression.

Even if his disciple managed to win in the confrontation, he had already lost to Chu Feng in terms of talent.

A person of the younger generation was able to comprehend rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation. A genius of that caliber was truly rare.

At the very least, it was a feat that was impossible for his disciple.

Suddenly, the Revered Master Beast Tamer and Grandmaster Tang Chen’s expressions changed.

Then, Revered Master Beast Tamer revealed a look of joy, whereas Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu narrowed their brows.

After a series of confrontations, Chu Feng’s power began to weaken. The equilibrium was shifting.

Sure enough, not long afterward, the enormous waves that Chu Feng had sent forth were no longer able to withstand Li Fengxue’s giant spirit formation beasts.

Seeing that his opponent’s attacks were closing in on him and he was unable to do anything about it, Chu Feng spoke, “I concede.”

After he conceded, Li Fengxue did not continue with his attack. Instead, he promptly stopped.

He knew very well that with Grandmaster Tang Chen present, even if he was unwilling to stop, he would not be able to cause any harm to Chu Feng. As such, it was better that he stop at once, and appear to have the demeanor of a nobleman.

“Little brother, you’re quite excellent. To be able to compete against this Li Fengxue with slaughtering formations to such a degree, you’re truly quite good.”

“That said, I still haven’t gone all-out. Nevertheless, you’re much stronger than brother Yuan Shu.”

As Li Fengxue said those words, he took a glance at Yuan Shu.

He did not forget to insult Yuan Shu after defeating Chu Feng.

Yuan Shu did not take much offense to it, but Grandmaster Tang Chen’s expression turned ugly.

Grandmaster Tang Chen was an overly protective master. Thus, it was only natural that he felt displeased when his disciple was being insulted in such a manner.

Unfortunately, his disciple was truly weaker. As such, he was unable to offer any refute.

“You didn’t go all-out?”

“In that case, I’m interested in seeing what it would be like if you went all-out.”

“How about we have another match?” Chu Feng said to Li Fengxue.

“Brat, are you trying to be a sore loser?”

Hearing those words, Li Fengxue’s gaze turned cold and dark.

Although his master hadn’t said anything, his gaze had also turned hostile.

They were afraid that Chu Feng would refuse to abide by his promise, and would not hand over the Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

“No, of course not. I, Chu Feng, am always one to keep my promises.”

“Here’s the Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain. Take it.”

Chu Feng took out the incomplete map and tossed it to Li Fengxue.

After receiving the incomplete map, Li Fengxue immediately went over to his master. He wanted his master to personally confirm the incomplete map’s authenticity.

Revered Master Beast Tamer was not careless either. He carefully inspected the Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain.

After discovering that the map was real, he began grinning from ear to ear, unable to conceal his happiness.

He was so overjoyed that he even started laughing.
