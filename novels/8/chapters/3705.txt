Chapter 3705 - Strange Spirit Formation Gate

“Father, you should lecture big brother Hongfei.”

“He has changed. He is no longer like before,” said Linghu Yueyue. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Yueyue, this is your actual big brother Hongfei. If anything, it can only be said that you did not know him well in the past,” said the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Father, what do you mean?”

Hearing those words, Linghu Yueyue’s expression changed. Unease appeared in her eyes.

“Yueyue, in the past, our Linghu Heavenly Clan needed to lay low and endure silently. However, we no longer need to do so.”

“Thus, Hongfei no longer needs to pretend to be an educated and well-behaved youngster.”

“He’s now capable of being a person that brings fear upon everyone in the world," the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said to Linghu Yueyue.

Hearing those words, the unease in Linghu Yueyue’s eyes grew even more intense. She seemed to have a lot of things that she wanted to say. However, in the end, she didn’t say anything.

She sensed ambition from Linghu Hongfei. However, she sensed even stronger ambition from her father.

She didn’t know if this was a good thing or a bad thing for their Linghu Heavenly Clan.

However, she was not fond of such a Linghu Hongfei, not fond of such a father.

That said, she knew very well that it was impossible for her to change anything.

“Lord Clan Chief.”

Suddenly, an old man rapidly flew over and landed before the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

This old man was not an ordinary old man. Instead, he was a Supreme Elder of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Even though he also did not possess the qualifications to enter that place, the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was simply in a great mood. Thus, instead of punishing him for coming there, he instead smiled and asked with a very amiable tone, “What’s wrong?”

“Lord Clan Chief, please have a look.”

That elder walked over and opened a case. After the case was opened, a firefly-like bead of light flew out.

Upon seeing that bead of light, the expression of the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately became stern.

That bead seemed to contain something inside it. Merely, one needed a special method to decipher its contents.

Furthermore, the special method could only be used once. Otherwise, the bead would shatter.

That said, the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief possessed the method to decipher the contents of the bead.

After the bead was unsealed, it scattered and turned into a ray of light that entered the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s forehead.

In the next moment, the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s face brimmed with joy.

“Send an order to the Tantai Heavenly Clan, Jiaoli Heavenly Clan, Heaven-reaching Beast Clan and Nightmare Spirit Clan,” said the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Lord Clan Chief, are we going to carry out the final battle against the Starfield Master Realm?”

The four Supreme Elders asked in unison.

The Tantai Heavenly Clan and the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan had already entered an alliance with them. However, unless it was during crucial moments, the two clans would not involve themselves in the war.

Since the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had decided to issue an order to them, it meant that they had a huge operation in mind.

Faced with that question, the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief let out a faint laugh. “Battle?”

“It would be more exact to say that we will be thoroughly eliminating the Wuming Clan from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

When he said those words, a look of absolute confidence appeared on his face.

......

Meanwhile. Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan were still in the Mirror Sea.

Gu Mingyuan was still standing at the same location as she looked down at Chu Feng, below who was diving deeper into the water. Shame and pain filled her gaze.

Chu Feng had really managed to accomplish what he said he could. He was slowly going deeper and deeper, forcibly withstanding successive powerful waves coming from below.

Even though the speed at which he was diving was very slow, he was making steady progress.

That said, Chu Feng had paid a considerable price in order to accomplish such a feat.

Forcibly taking on the waves with his body left his body in tatters.

It was not only his physical body that was completely mutilated; even his soul received enormous trauma.

Once Chu Feng’s body was mutilated by the impact of a wave, he immediately recovered. It was like he was completely fine, undying and indestructible. No matter how the waves pounded against him, he remained alive, and continued to dive.

However, Gu Mingyuan knew Chu Feng was not really undying and indestructible. Instead, he had some sort of special ability. When he was not attacked by a power much greater than his own, that ability would grant him an undying and indestructible body.

In fact, that was indeed the sort of ability that Chu Feng possessed.

It was the Five Elements Secret Skills.

The Five Elements Secret Skills were obtained by Chu Feng in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

They were originally very powerful. Merely, as Chu Feng’s cultivation increased, the Five Elements Secret Skills began to lose their effect.

However, the Five Elements Secret Skills still had one effect.

That is, should Chu Feng fight someone of the same cultivation or the same battle power, he would be practically unkillable.

At that moment, the reason why Chu Feng was able to withstand the attacks from the waves was due to none other than the Five Elements Secret Skills.

It could be said that the effect of the Five Elements Secret Skills was an ability that could save his life, or even allow him to mount surprise attacks.

However, after Chu Feng arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the opponents he encountered that possessed the same cultivation or battle power as him were practically all no match for him.

As for those people capable of posing a threat to him, their strength was much greater than his own.

Thus, even though the Five Elements Secret Skills granted Chu Feng an undying and indestructible body, their ability could not be used due to the unfavorable conditions.

However, the Five Elements Secret Skills finally came to good use again.

The power and impact of the waves were the same for every individual.

In other words, they brought the same sort of pain to Chu Feng as they did to Gu Mingyuan.

The power of the wave was only slightly stronger than the individual, making the individual unable to contend against it. However, it was not strong to a degree where it could kill the individual.

With the situation being like that, Chu Feng’s Five Elements Secret Skills were able to be of use.

Using the power of the Five Elements Secret Skills, Chu Feng obtained an undying body, and continued to slowly submerge himself.

Even though it took a rather long time, Chu Feng still succeeded.

After some time had passed, he reached the seabed. He was even able to see the Deepsea Pupils with his naked eyes.

The Deepsea Pupils came in a pair. They were eye-sized and completely azure, like seawater.

However, if one were to look closely, one would see that they seemed to contain an ocean, a boundless ocean.

Beautiful. They were truly beautiful. Seeing the Deepsea Pupils, Chu Feng felt slightly comforted.

Chu Lingxi’s eyes were very beautiful to begin with. They were practically irreplaceable.

However, after seeing the Deepsea Pupils, Chu Feng felt that perhaps the Deepsea Pupils might be able to replace her eyes.

The Deepsea Pupils were not only extremely beautiful, but they also contained enormous power.

If they were used as Chu Lingxi’s eyes, perhaps they would be able to provide great assistance to her on her martial cultivation path.

Although Chu Feng was able to see the Deepsea Pupils, the Deepsea Pupils were still quite a distance away from him.

It was simply impossible for him to retrieve them from his current location. Thus, after a brief moment of observing them, Chu Feng turned his gaze to a place nearby.

There was a cave entrance-like spirit formation gate. The waves that battered Chu Feng nonstop were released by that spirit formation gate.

Chu Feng arrived before that spirit formation gate and set up a spirit formation. Using that spirit formation, he forcibly blocked up that spirit formation gate.

Although he couldn’t seal the spirit formation gate completely, he made it so that it couldn’t send out any more waves.

However, because of that, Chu Feng was unable to move.

He had to continuously use his spirit power to suppress the spirit formation gate. If he left the vicinity, the spirit formation gate would send out waves again.

Feeling that he had succeeded, Chu Feng shouted, “Senior, it’s up to you!”

Hearing Chu Feng’s words, Gu Mingyuan immediately rushed forth and arrived before the Deepsea Pupils.

“Buzz~~~”

However, before she could retrieve them, an enormous suction enveloped her.

Another spirit formation gate appeared at a location near the Deepsea Pupils.

However, that spirit formation gate was completely different from the spirit formation gate Chu Feng had sealed up.

The spirit formation gate Chu Feng had sealed up released waves outward to push others away.

However, the spirit formation gate that had appeared near the Deepsea Pupils was different. That spirit formation gate released suction power that would suck one into it.

The suction was extremely powerful. Not even Gu Mingyuan was able to resist it. Even though she tried everything to escape the suction, she was still slowly being sucked into the spirit formation gate.

Gu Mingyuan tried all sorts of methods to break free. She tried to create spirit formation clones, used Immortal Techniques, world spirit techniques and even secret skills to block that spirit formation gate.

However, all of them were completely useless. All of her abilities were sucked into that spirit formation gate.

Most terrifying of all, that spirit formation gate was not only emitting a massive suction power, but it was also emitting an extremely terrifying aura.

It was the aura of death. Sensing that aura, both Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan knew that they could not allow themselves to fall into that spirit formation gate. Otherwise, they might end up losing their lives to it.
