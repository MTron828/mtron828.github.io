Chapter 2528 - Four Tier One Powers

“Rest assured, I will not go and battle against the four tier one powers by myself. However, I will also not be staying on Mount Cloud Crane,” Chu Feng said determinedly.

“I truly don’t know what to do with you. However, regardless, you must care for your safety. I hope that when I return, you’ll be able to stand before me unscathed.”

“No, not hope, instead, you must definitely stand before me unscathed.”

“Chu Feng, as Wang Qiang is my husband, he cannot be considered to be my friend.”

“Thus, I, Zhao Hong, only have you as my friend. I also only recognize you as my friend.”

“I hope that the three of us can journey together,” After saying those words, the corners of Zhao Hong’s eyes actually started to moisten.

She was looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with concern.

Zhao Hong was truly no longer that cold-blooded and ruthless demonic woman. She had become emotional. Her rare emotions were placed onto Wang Qiang and Chu Feng.

Toward Wang Qiang, she felt love.

Toward Chu Feng, she felt friendship.

At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart also started to feel sour.

As Zhao Hong’s only friend, he was able to sense how much he weighed in her heart.

“Very well, let’s make a promise today. When Wang Qiang awakens, the two of us must both stand before him unscathed.”

“Regardless of whether it is the Upper Realms or the Starfields, in the future, the three of us will journey to them together,” Chu Feng said to Zhao Hong.

“Mn,” Zhao Hong nodded sternly.

Then, Zhao Hong left. As for Chu Feng, he returned to bid his farewell to the Golden Crane True Immortal and then also left.

Zhao Hong had left for that remnant.

As for Chu Feng, he naturally had a destination in mind too. Chu Feng’s destination was a place called the Demon Elimination Cave.

Chu Feng was proceeding for the Demon Elimination Cave to search for someone, a person by the name of Zi Xunyi.

Back in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, not only did Chu Feng obtain the Kong Heavenly Clan’s ancestor’s inheritance, he had also encountered an individual. That individual was the City Master of Hero City, whose reputation had shaken the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm a thousand years ago, Ying Mingchao.

Ying Mingchao was plotted against by both the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan. He was forced to use his Taboo Technique to escape. However, that Taboo Technique caused him to be trapped inside the Kong Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area, the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.

Chu Feng had promised Ying Mingchao that he would help rescue him. As for the person that could rescue Ying Mingchao, it was a person by the name of Zi Xunyi.

......

Should Chu Feng be able to successfully rescue Ying Mingchao, Ying Mingchao would definitely take revenge against the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan.

Thus, the top priority for Chu Feng would be to rescue Ying Mingchao. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

As Chu Feng bid his farewell to the Golden Crane True Immortal, he had also inquired about how to proceed for the Demon Elimination Cave.

Although the Demon Elimination Cave was a dangerous place, Ying Mingchao had given Chu Feng a route to take. Thus, Chu Feng’s journey toward the Demon Elimination Cave could be said to be sure-fire and worry-free.

However, Chu Feng had no idea that while he was proceeding for the Demon Elimination Cave, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the Immortal Sword School’s Headmaster and the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s Abbot had all arrived at the Zhou Heavenly Clan.

Inside the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s most gorgeous main palace hall, the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, as well as their several Utmost Exalted Elders, were all present.

Although not a lot of people were present in the palace hall, they were all True Immortal-level experts.

At that moment, those True Immortal-level experts were gathered around three coffins.

Those three coffins were all made of crystal. Not only were they capable of stopping the decay of corpses, one could also see the corpses through the crystal coffins.

The corpses inside the three crystal coffins were respectively, Dugu Jianxu, the Wine-Meat Monk and Zhou Fukong.

Suddenly, an old man among the crowd spoke, “Two sirs, are the two of you still unable to make a resolution?”

This old man was very tall and sturdy. He possessed two long patches of white hair on his temples, but the rest of his hair was jet-black.

At a glance, he simply did not resemble an old man. Furthermore, his aura was extremely fierce and tough.

This was especially true for his eyes. They simply did not resemble human eyes, as they were even sharper, even fiercer, than the eyes of ferocious beasts.

He was the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Zhou Yuyuan.

His words were spoken toward two individuals.

They were two old men...

One of them was filled with the aura of immortality. On his back were three swords. He appeared very mysterious, and gave off the airs of a living immortal.

He was the headmaster of the Immortal Sword School, Daoist Sword Governor.

As for the other old man, he was a very amiable-looking monk with a very petite build. He was the Abbot of Buddha’s Heavenly Temple, Monk Yuangui. [1. Yuangui means ‘desire to return.’ A monk-sounding name I guess.]

The two of them had been here for a while now. They had also come to know about what had happened.

The Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan naturally wanted them all to join hands to eradicate Chu Feng together.

Merely, the two of them were hesitant.

“Chu Feng has killed our most prospective disciples. He is clearly not placing us in his eyes.”

“If we are to let this matter go like this, wouldn’t we become objects of ridicule for the people of the world?”

“I truly do not understand why the two of you are still hesitating,” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had become impatient.

“Jingyi has always been a naughty and mischievous child. He had indeed done many excessive things. I have punished him severely so as to discipline him. However, time and time again, he refused to repent.”

“Originally, I had planned to lock him up in our Buddha’s Heavenly Temple so that he would not go out to stir up troubles. Never would I have expected for this matter to happen before I could do so.”

“However, with the nature of this child Jingyi, it is very hard for me to say that Chu Feng is in the wrong here.”

“Thus, before we thoroughly investigate what happened, I will not rashly attack Chu Feng,” The Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s Abbot gently caressed the Wine-Meat Monk’s coffin as he spoke.

As for the Jingyi that he spoke of, it was the Wine-Meat Monk’s buddhist name. [2. Jingyi means ‘cleanse one.’]

“What is there to investigate? There were so many people present back then. They were all able to verify that Chu Feng was the one in the wrong,” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Our Buddha’s Heavenly Temple will look into this matter ourselves. Farewell,” As the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s Abbot spoke, he soared into the sky. The crystal coffin with the Wine-Meat Monk also left with him.

“My opinion is the same as Grandmaster Yuangui’s. Two sirs, please don’t think too much into it. It is not that I do not believe you all. Merely, for some things, I wish to personally verify them first. After all, this matter is of great concern.”

“Apart from that, I thank you all for bringing back Jianxu’s body. Farewell,” After that, the Immortal Sword School’s Headmaster also left with Dugu Jianxu’s corpse.

At that moment, only the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan remained in the palace hall.

“Those two are still this indecisive. Who knows how long they are going to investigate this matter,” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief complained angrily.

“You couldn’t possibly really be thinking that they’re planning to investigate, right?” At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, who had been silent the entire time, suddenly spoke.

“You mean to say that they do not plan to make an enemy of Chu Feng?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“That’s obvious. They will not act,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Then what about you? What do you plan to do?” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked. From his gaze, it could be seen that he was very afraid that the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief would also decide to not confront Chu Feng.

“It is all because of that Chu Feng that our Kong Heavenly Clan has fallen to our current state. There is already no way out for me. Even if I do not attack him, he will not let me off.”

“Thus, it should be me asking you, are you willing to join hands with me to eliminate that Chu Feng?” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Is there even a need for you to ask me that? I am definitely not going to let things go. Not only that Chu Feng, that Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang are also going to be eliminated.”

“Not only them, but everyone related to them shall be eliminated. Else... I will not be able to curb my anger, my hatred.” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke as he gnashed his teeth angrily. Intense and frightening killing intent was present in his eyes.
