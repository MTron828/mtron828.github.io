Chapter 5686: Do Me a Favor

Chapter 5686: Do Me a Favor

“Rest assured, I have tight lips,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.

Under Ling Xinian’s invitation, he moved in together with Ling Xinian instead of returning to his palace in the Lower Mansion.

Following that, Ling Xinian, Ling Yunhao, and the others held a party to celebrate Chu Feng’s feat of clearing the Seven Stars Gravity Towers. Chu Feng had a bright smile on during the party, but he wasn’t moved by their gesture at all.

It was only during times of difficulty that a person’s true character showed.

He still remembered the looks of enmity he had received from the crowd when he cleared the Seven Stars Gravity Towers. If not for the Saint-tier elder hinting that they should get along with Chu Feng, Ling Xinian and the others wouldn’t have even dared to talk to him, let alone hold this party for him.

Shortly after the celebration began, Chu Feng claimed that he wasn’t feeling well and excused himself to rest in the room Ling Xinian assigned to him.

It was a fruitful trip. On top of receiving the Seven Stars Gravity Tower’s protective formation, he had managed to significantly temper his psyche too. That brought him a step closer to making a breakthrough.

“Hm?” Chu Feng suddenly widened his eyes.

He sensed another presence in the room. Someone was staring at him.

Before he could get up, a sealing formation locked him in place. Then, a person appeared.

“Lord Canghai?” Chu Feng recognized the person to be the elder who was known as the strongest pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist after stagnating for tens of thousands of years. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Young friend Chu Feng, won’t you do me a favor?” Ling Canghai asked with an eerie smile.

With a wave of his sleeves, he teleported Chu Feng out of Ling Xinian’s residence before dragging the latter all the way to his own residence.

Ling Canghai’s residence was small and tattered, but it was surrounded by many layers of formations. It was only when Chu Feng entered the residence that he realized there was more to the residence than what could be seen outside.

There was a hidden underground palace.

Ling Canghai dragged Chu Feng deep into the underground palace, where he immediately was met by an awful blood stench. Without a doubt, many people had died here. They ventured deeper into the underground palace till they arrived at a door.

The moment Ling Canghai opened the door, an even stronger stench of blood assaulted them. Inside the room was a copper pill cauldron, and that was where the blood stench was coming from.

Chu Feng knew right away that Ling Canghai was not a good person. What was being forged inside the cauldron was not medicinal herbs but humans.

“Young friend Chu Feng, do you know what this cauldron is for?” Ling Canghai asked with a sinister smile.

“Are you practicing a demonic cultivation skill?”

“Hahahaha!” Ling Canghai’s laughter was so hoarse that it felt unnerving. “Who’s to say what’s good and what’s bad? Don’t you think it’s naive to say that a cultivation skill is demonic just because it requires me to murder people? If so, nothing is good in the world. Those who stand at the top of the world of cultivation all have their hands stained with blood!”

“Does the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion know about this?” Chu Feng asked.

“So what if they know? So what if they don’t? It’s the victor who writes history. Once I master my cultivation skill, who’d dare point their finger at me?” Ling Canghai asked.

“Did you bring me here to assimilate?” Chu Feng asked.

Ling Canghai didn’t hide any of his dirty secrets from Chu Feng at all despite it being their first time meeting. This likely meant that Ling Canghai didn’t intend for him to leave this place alive.

“Don’t blame me, young friend Chu Feng. I have been trying to forge my Divine Pill for many years now, but I haven’t been able to make a breakthrough, so I wanted to look for a talented junior to aid me on that,” Ling Canghai said.

“Are those who died here members of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?”

“Of course not. Do you think I’d make a move on my own people?”

“If so, why are you targeting me? I’ll be a member of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion soon.”

Ling Canghai revealed a cruel smile reminiscent of a demon, revealing his blackened teeth. “You’re talented but naive. Do you think passing the entrance examination automatically makes you one of us? Have you seen the people residing in the Lower Mansion? Do you think that they are truly one of us?”

Chu Feng didn’t answer the question.

While those from the Lower Mansion were, in name, members of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, in truth, they were no more than slaves.

“Think about, young friend Chu Feng. Where are you residing now?” Ling Canghai asked.

“So, we’re no different from those in the Lower Mansion despite having cleared those trials?” Chu Feng asked.

“No, there’s a difference. You’re talented. There’ll be chances to enter the Ordinary Mansion, even if not the Heaven Mansion. Still, you’ll never truly become a part of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Even if they treat you well, it’s only because you have value to us.

“I’m sure you don’t want a life where you’re used by others. You might as well just die early so that you can go into your next life fast. Rather than struggling here, you might as well let me free you from your restraints. You’ll be doing me a favor here too. At least it’ll give your life meaning,” Ling Canghai said as he dragged Chu Feng up to the pill cauldron.

“The greatest meaning in my life is to slaughter you, old bastard,” Chu Feng sneered.

Ling Canghai cackled as he opened the pill cauldron to toss Chu Feng in.

Boom!

The formation restraining Chu Feng suddenly shattered, and a towering figure appeared behind him. It was the Asura King, Kui Ting!
