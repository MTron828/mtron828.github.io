Chapter 4295 - Only Talent Mattered

“Senior, exactly what happened?”

En route, Chu Feng was finally unable to contain himself from asking that question.

“Chu Feng, Shaoyu is in danger.”

“Only you can help him.”

“He is challenging something.”

“What he challenged was something that tests one’s talent.”

“Only those with strong talent are able to challenge it. Right now, he is in mid-challenge. However, things are not looking good.”

“In this sort of situation, he needed someone to take on the danger together with him.”

“You are very talented. You are able to help him.”

Lady Gusu did not attempt to conceal things and informed Chu Feng of the course of events.

While they’re talking, they’ve arrived at the entrance created by the case.

Xianhai Xin’er who was guarding this place had disappeared.

But, Xianhai Shaoyu’s Life Talisman Paper was still present.

“Crap!”

Lady Gusu’s expression changed enormously when she saw the Life Talisman Paper.

Originally, she went to find Chu Feng just in case things turned bad.

But, that Life Talisman Paper had already changed.

Xianhai Shaoyu’s life was evidently already in threat.

The thing Xianhai Gusu feared the most happened.

There was a need to question where Xianhai Xin’er was. She must’ve noticed that Xianhai Shaoyu was in danger and entered through the spirit formation gate to aid Xianhai Shaoyu withstand the power within.

“Senior, I am to enter through this, right?” Chu Feng looked to the spirit formation gate and asked Xianhai Gusu for confirmation.

“Right. It’s this spirit formation gate,” said Xianhai Gusu.

“Got it.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he walked over to the spirit formation gate.

“Chu Feng, wait.”

Xianhai Gusu suddenly called out to him.

“Senior, is there any other matter?” asked Chu Feng.

Xianhai Gusu was hesitant. But, in the end, she made a decision.

“Chu Feng, I must inform you of the truth of the matter.”

“The power inside there is very terrifying. But, I do not know exactly how strong and what sort of power it is. All I can say is that it’s very dangerous inside.”

“By entering it, you might be able to withstand that power together with Shaoyu and return safely.”

“But, it is also possible that you two might fail to withstand the power. Should that happen, you will also die in there...”

In the end, Xianhai Gusu warned Chu Feng of the dangers.

“Senior, please rest assured. I will definitely bring brother Shaoyu back safely.”

Chu Feng smiled at Xianhai Gusu’s warning.

After saying those words, Chu Feng turned around and stepped into the spirit formation gate.

Seeing that Chu Feng did not hesitate to enter knowing fully of how dangerous it was, Xianhai Gusu suddenly realized why Xianhai Shaoyu believed in Chu Feng this much.

She finally realized why he was willing to brave such dangers for Chu Feng.

......

After passing through the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng entered a vast starry sky.

This was not a world he arrived in. Instead, it was the vast and boundless starry sky.

This was not a created world. Instead, it was the actual boundless starry sky. All the stars that were visible to Chu Feng’s eyes were different worlds.

Beautiful. The scenery of this place was truly beautiful. This was especially true for martial cultivators...

This boundless and mysterious starry sky made Chu Feng realize how small he was and how much he yearned for greater power.

But, at this moment, Chu Feng does not possess any desire to appreciate the beauty of this place.

The reason for that was because terrifying power had covered the sky above him like a boundless amount of black clouds.

There were frantic lightnings, surging winds, and boiling flames within the black clouds.

Those three different sorts of powers were all extremely terrifying. They seemed like the convergence of hundreds of millions of ferocious beasts spiraling above Chu Feng’s head.

Merely by entering this place, Chu Feng felt enormous oppression.

That oppression came from above.

Although that terrifying power was gathering above him, it was spiraling like a vortex.

Chu Feng could sense that the oppression he felt from the above his head was merely the weakest extent of that terrifying power.

The deeper into it, the stronger the power will become.

Standing where he was, Chu Feng was unable to find Fumo Shaoyu’s figure. But, he saw sight of Fumo Xin’er.

Fumo Xin’er was struggling as she tried to approach the terrifying vortex.

Even though she was still at the outermost region of the vortex, that power was already descending from the sky and attacking her.

The violent winds were coming down upon her. Like ferocious beasts, they pounded against Fumo Xin’er’s body repeatedly.

Fumo Xin’er swayed back and forth. She was unable to even stand firm. A moment of carelessness caused her to be suppressed to the ground by that power.

But, she immediately stood back up and once again struggled her way back toward the terrifying vortex.

Fumo Xin’er was completely covered in cuts and bruises. Yet, she was only in the vicinity of the terrifying vortex and not inside it.

Even that terrifying violent wind that attacked her was only one of the three different kinds of powers.

Flame, wind and lightning. Only one of the three struck her.

Even for the wind, only a very weak subset of it came down at Fumo Xin’er.

Fumo Xin’er was still far from reaching the truly terrifying powers in the sky above. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Fumo Xin’er was still very far away from the depths of that vortex.

But... it was clear that she was already on the verge of collapse.

“Lord young master?”

Chu Feng immediately walked over to Fumo Xin’er.

But, as he walked closer to her, his expression changed.

As he approached, he was able to hear Fumo Xin’er’s voice.

She was clearly trying to rescue Fumo Shaoyu. Yet, she was shouting for ‘lord young master’ the entire time.

This made Chu Feng suddenly realize that the relationship between Fumo Xin’er and Fumo Shaoyu was not what he knew.

This included their so-called grandma. She seemed to be not as simple as Chu Feng imagined either.

There must be some sort of secret unknown to Chu Feng between them.

“Lord young master, lord young master!”

“If you’re unable to withstand it, please leave this place!”

“Lord young master!”

Xianhai Xin’er didn’t know Chu Feng had arrived.

She was shouting with her all and trying to have Xianhai Shouyu hear her.

But, in this place, her powers were completely suppressed. It was so much that she shouted herself hoarse.

Because of that, she realized that her cultivation seemed to be completely useless in this place that relied on one’s talent.
