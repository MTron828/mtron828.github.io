Chapter 5926: The World Spiritist Emperor’s Domain

“Elder, who’s the one who captured you here, and what is their goal?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know who’s the one who put us in here. We only know that it’s a powerful woman who doesn’t seem to be from the present era.

“As I told you, this place used to be one of the World Spiritist Emperor’s domains, just that it has suffered some damage. That woman brought us here, demanding that we would use our clan’s dragon breath energy to recover this domain,” Long Moxiao explained.

“Elder, did you see that woman’s appearance?”

“She didn’t show her face.”

“Did she promise to free you once the crack is repaired?”

“She said that the restriction formations on us will unravel once the crack is repaired, and we would be allowed to leave this place.”

“That’s good to hear.”

“It’s not that easy. The crack isn’t that easy to repair.”

“Elder, why are you looking for me?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.

“This... I’ll have Mucheng talk to you instead,” Long Moxiao replied.

After a long walk, they finally walked out of this formation space.

A majestic sight unfolded before Chu Feng and Zi Ling’s eyes. It was so majestic that Zi Ling’s mouth opened in shock. She couldn’t resist the urge to rise into the sky to take a closer look.

What was flying in the sky weren’t birds but massive dragons that were hundreds of thousands of meters long. The forests, mountains, rivers, and even palaces were shaped like dragons. It was grand and exquisite.

The surroundings were suffused with concentrated yang energy—it was the aura of dragons.

These were actually all fake, but they were shocked because of how lifelike it was.

Chu Feng finally realized why the mysterious powerful woman sought the Dragon Breath Clan; they were descendants of the Dragon Clan, after all.

However, as Long Moxiao had previously said, many of the buildings were damaged. It would be difficult to repair them since these were all created by Qin Jiu. None in the present era could match his prowess as a world spiritist.

Furthermore, Chu Feng could tell that Qin Jiu didn’t construct these on a whim; he had put elaborate effort into it. Given so, it would be no easy feat to restore it to its original condition. Even Chu Feng wouldn’t be able to do so.

“Grand, isn’t it?” Long Moxiao smiled at Chu Feng and Zi Ling.

Despite being a True Dragon World Spiritist, he, too, was awed by the world before him when he first arrived. He was stifled at being trapped here, but that didn’t hinder him from being awed by the means of the World Spiritist Emperor.

“It’s amazing,” Chu Feng and Zi Ling replied.

“It’s normal. We’re in the World Spiritist Emperor’s domain, after all,” Long Moxiao replied.

“Elder, how do you intend to repair this?” Chu Feng asked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After taking a look, he concluded that it would be too difficult to repair this place. Even a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist like Long Moxiao would struggle to pull it off.

“There used to be a reparation formation here, but the reparation formation has been impaired too, resulting in the energy stored in there leaking out. That’s why that woman needed our clan’s dragon breath energy. All we need to do is to infuse the dragon breath energy into it,” Long Moxiao explained.

“It doesn’t seem like there’s any signs of reparation,” Chu Feng pointed out.

He could tell that this place had been damaged for a long time, probably in the Ancient Era. Many years had passed since, but most of the damaged areas remained in the same condition.

“The formation is also damaged. It needs to be filled up before it can be activated. We did an estimation. Even if our clan of 30,000 people infused our dragon breath energy into the formation without rest, it would still take at least ten thousand years.

“But how can we go without rest? And what we are infusing in is our dragon breath energy! It will likely take us at least tens of thousands of years before we can leave this place,” Long Moxiao exclaimed.

“So long?”

Chu Feng and Zi Ling finally understood why the Dragon Breath Clan was determined to break out despite the risks.

Under Long Moxiao’s guidance, they soon arrived in the middle of an ocean. A dragon silhouette could be seen coiling in the ocean depth.

Chu Feng could tell right away that this was the reparation formation.

All rivers in this realm flowed toward this ocean. Should this ocean release its energy, it would swiftly permeate the entire realm.

The reparation formation had a formation core, and there were many Dragon Breath Clansmen seated inside, infusing their dragon breath energy into the formation core. Their complexions looked awful as they were depleting their energy.

There was another group floating in the air. They were Dragon Breath Clansmen too, but instead of infusing their dragon breath energy into the reparation formation, they were busy constructing a teleportation formation.

This teleportation formation was exquisite, and it was used to activate the teleportation passageway. The teleportation formation could be linked to the reparation formation, but it wasn’t fully connected.

The teleportation formation was constructed here because it was designed to siphon the reparation formation’s energy. In fact, Chu Feng could tell that the teleportation formation was almost complete.

All of the Dragon Breath Clansmen noticed the presence of Chu Feng’s group and looked over.

A beautiful middle-aged woman seated in the formation core stood up, and the others followed suit.

“The rest of you continue,” the middle-aged woman ordered.

The other clansmen sat back down.

The middle-aged woman rose into the sky and smiled at Chu Feng. Her smile made her look even more ravishing. Now that she was closer, Chu Feng could see that she was a voluptuous figure that gave her a charm that young ladies lacked.

“We finally meet, Chu Feng. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Long Mucheng,” the woman said.

“Paying respect to Elder Long.” Chu Feng and Zi Long bowed.

“We should have met earlier, but fate played a prank on us. I arrived at the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber shortly after you deciphered the True Dragon Chessboard, but you have already left. I sent someone to look for you, but you were nowhere to be found,” Long Mucheng said.
