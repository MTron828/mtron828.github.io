Chapter 4211 - Returning To the Seven Suns Mountain Range

“That’s not important anymore. What sort of favorable encounter Chu Feng might’ve had is his business.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Regardless of what his favorable encounter might have been, regardless of what sort of secret he might be hiding, it doesn’t change the fact that he saved our lives.”

“If it wasn’t for him, all of us would have died today.”

“Furthermore, for the sake of saving us, he offended the All-seeing Heavenly Master.”

“The grace he showed us is something that we cannot forget,” said Long Xiaoxiao.

“What Your Highness says is very correct.”

Long Shengbu, Long Nanxun and even Elder Ruiyun all agreed with Long Xiaoxiao’s words.

Even though they had a lot of questions about Chu Feng, it remained that both Long Nanxun and Elder Ruiyun had gained a whole new opinion of Chu Feng after what had happened.

......

With the power of the main formation, Chu Feng and Yu Ting soon arrived at the Reincarnation Upper Realm.

The spirit formation gate that connected to the Reincarnation Upper Realm was not hidden in a remnant.

Instead, it was hidden somewhere deep underground.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that the spirit formation gate in the Reincarnation Upper Realm was located right below the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

As for the Seven Suns Mountain Range, it was where Yuan Shu was.

“Sure enough, senior Ox-nose has set up all these spirit formation gates deliberately.”

“He knew that Grandmaster Tang Chen was here. That’s why he used the power of the Dark Black Monstrous God’s housing to set up a spirit formation gate here. It’s all for his own convenience.”

After coming from underground, Chu Feng sighed with emotions.

More emotions filled his head as he looked at the Seven Suns Mountain Range. After all, there was a series of memories he had made there.

But, Chu Feng soon cast his gaze to the area above the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

He discovered that there was an enormous war chariot there.

That war chariot was so vast that there were dozens of gorgeous palaces atop it.

The enormous war chariot was towed by over a hundred giant spirit formation beasts.

Each of those giant spirit formation beasts was over a thousand meters tall.

That said, the giant war chariot was hidden by a concealment formation.

Because of that, others were simply unable to detect it.

Even Chu Feng had only been able to sense it earlier.

When he saw the giant war chariot, Chu Feng narrowed his brows.

The giant war chariot was simply extraordinary, which meant that the master of the giant war chariot must be an exceptional expert.

Even though cultivators from all over had set up camp at the foot of the Seven Suns Mountain Range year-round, those cultivators clearly couldn’t be compared to the giant war chariot’s master.

In fact, even Yuan Shu would not be able to compare with an existence of that caliber.

Most likely, the giant war chariot had not come for Yuan Shu.

Instead, it had come for his master, Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Chu Feng had no idea if this was a calamity or a blessing.

His intuition was telling him that things were not simple.

Chu Feng didn’t want to implicate Yu Ting. Thus, he said to her, “Yu Ting, don’t go in just yet. Wait for me here.”

Yu Ting was no fool. She understood Chu Feng’s intentions. She raised her head and took a glance at the war chariot in the sky before nodding at Chu Feng, “You be careful then.”

Yu Ting did not make things difficult for Chu Feng. She had decided to stay and wait for him.

After Yu Ting agreed to wait, Chu Feng immediately proceeded toward the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

......

Yuan Shu stood Inside a forbidden area in the Seven Suns Mountain Range..

Standing across from him was another person.

Even though that person had the face of a young man, he had a head of long snow-white hair.

Although his appearance was rather handsome, it was also very treacherous.

Especially his eyes. One could tell from a glance that he was a villain of some sort.

He was looking at Yuan Shu with a gaze filled with provocation.

It turned out that the two of them were competing with world spirit techniques.

One person was attacking, and the other was defending.

The person attacking was Yuan Shu.

The spirit formation that Yuan Shu had set up for his attack had taken the form of eighteen weapons.

The eighteen weapons were all glistening with golden light. They each measured a thousand meters, and were attacking his opponent’s protective formation from all sides.

Yuan Shu’s opponent’s protective formation was very simple.

It was only a semi-transparent spheroid. The spheroid covered the white-haired man’s entire body.

But, Yuan Shu was actually unable to do anything to that simple-looking protective formation.

“Yuan Shu, time’s up,” the white-haired man said suddenly.

Hearing those words, Yuan Shu waved his sleeve, and the eighteen enormous weapons floating in midair all turned into light and dispersed into thin air.

Compared to the man’s calm composure, Yuan Shu was covered in sweat, and even panting.

But, when Yuan Shu looked to that man, he had a smile on his face.

“Brother Li, it is this Yuan Shu’s defeat.”

“Although I’ve recently comprehended rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, I am clearly still no match for brother Li,” said Yuan Shu.

“Yuan Shu, you shouldn’t admit defeat so quickly.”

“Didn’t we agree to exchange the attack and defense order after a round?”

“Since you were attacking and I was defending in the first round, it’s now my turn to attack,” said the white-haired man.

“Brother Li, I’ve already acknowledged that I am no match for you. Must we still continue?” asked Yuan Shu.

“Of course. I’m actually specialized in protective formations. My offensive formations are not as strong.”

“Thus, brother Yuan Shu need not be too scared. Perhaps I won’t be able to breach brother Yuan Shu’s protective formation at all. Our spar today might end in a draw.”

“Besides, even if you fail to take my attack, I will stop promptly. I won’t injure brother Yuan Shu.”

“What’s more, the rules are a match each. Thus, we should abide by it,” said the white-haired man.

“It’s only a simple spar. There’s no need to insist like this, no?” Yuan Shu asked again, still with a smile.

“Humph.”

Suddenly, a cold snort was heard.

It turned out that there was a figure standing far from where the two people were sparring.

That figure was an old man.

The old man was quite different from the white-haired man.

The old man’s face was covered in wrinkles. From his appearance, one could tell that he was extremely old.

Yet, the old man had a head of long, jet-black hair.

The old man was very tall. His size was far larger than that of ordinary people. He was ten meters tall. He was like a small giant.

Moreover, his build was also robust. Even though he was wearing clothes, the outline of his muscles could still be seen.

Most importantly, the old man had a fierce face. His sharp eyebrows were especially vicious.

At that moment, the old man was standing far away with his hands crossed in front of his chest and staring at Yuan Shu with a look of contempt.

“Back then, Tang Chen had told me that the disciple he’d meticulously found possessed talent not inferior to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted’s disciple Lu Jie.”

“Seeing him today, not only are his world spirit techniques lacking, even his courage is exceptionally small.”

“To take someone this weak as his disciple, it would appear that Tang Chen has truly misjudged this time.”

The black-haired old man’s voice was thunderously loud. It was also filled with mockery.

When his words reached Yuan Shu’s ears, they ignited anger in him.

Then, Yuan Shu began setting up a spirit formation.

After a short period of time, enough for a cup of tea, an exquisite protective formation had appeared around him.

“Brother Li, come at me.”

When Yuan Shu said those words, even his gaze had changed.

Compared to before, he had become much more serious.
