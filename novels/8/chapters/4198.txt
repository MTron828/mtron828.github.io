Chapter 4198 - This Is Utmost Exalted!

“Done for, we’re done for.”

This was what everyone was thinking.

However, right at that moment, Chu Feng shot forth a palm strike.

Boundless martial power swept forth.

The martial power rapidly expanded; it squirmed as it expanded in size.

Soon, an enormous martial power palm appeared, reaching several tens of thousands of meters across.

Even space itself shattered before the martial power palm.

When they saw the martial power palm, those Exalted-level spirit formation beasts began to shriek in fear. They immediately turned around and began fleeing.

It turned out that those spirit formation beasts were capable of feeling fear.

Unfortunately, they were too late. Chu Feng’s giant martial power palm smashed forth explosively.

Where the giant martial power palm passed, all living beings were destroyed. The sky collapsed and the earth caved in.

One after another, the enormous spirit formation beasts were pulverized by the giant martial power palm.

In an instant, the spirit formation beasts that had covered a region of the sky had all been obliterated.

This was not only witnessed by the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk, it had also been witnessed by old man Zhao, Zhao Menglu, Xiao Yu and all the other residents.

Without exception, the people present were all stunned.

Their faces were no longer covered in shock. Instead, they showed terror. They were all terrified by the scene they’d just witnessed.

However, what terrified them was not the spirit formation beasts. Rather, it was Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was standing in the distant sky with his back to them.

His silhouette was small.

Yet, the impact it brought upon them was immense!

“Senior, it’s been a long time.”

Right when the crowd was still stunned, Chu Feng arrived before the plain-clothed old monk and greeted him respectfully.

“Chu Feng, you...”

“You couldn’t possibly have really reached the Utmost Exalted realm, right?” the Golden Crane True Immortal asked all of a sudden.

He had been skeptical of Chu Feng, and had even felt that he had ended up saying nonsense because he had suffered some shock.

However, he had begun to doubt himself.

“Utmost Exalted realm?”

The plain-clothed old monk was astonished upon hearing the words that were spoken by the Golden Crane True Immortal.

Even though he had witnessed Chu Feng obliterating those omnipresent Exalted-level spirit formation beasts with a single palm strike with his very eyes, he had thought Chu Feng to merely be an Exalted of a higher level than those spirit formation beasts at the very most.

Utmost Exalted? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That was something that he had never even dared to imagine.

Hearing this question from the Golden Crane True Immortal, Chu Feng suddenly smiled.

The Golden Crane True Immortal was doubting him.

Chu Feng’s clothes began to flutter. Then, a boundless aura was released from his body.

That aura was so powerful that it covered tens of thousands of miles.

The mountain, rivers, lakes and oceans were all instantly enveloped by Chu Feng’s aura.

His aura was so powerful that it controlled everything within the region.

With a single thought, Chu Feng could collapse mountains.

With a single thought, he could reverse the flow of rivers.

With a single thought, he could evaporate the ocean.

With a single thought, he could take the lives of all living beings within tens of thousands miles.

With a single thought, he could destroy everything and reduce them to ashes, erasing it from the face of the world!

“This... is the power of an Utmost Exalted?”

“This... is an Utmost Exalted level expert?!”

Not to mention the others, even the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk were completely dumbfounded from terror.

How could they not be afraid?

With a single thought from Chu Feng, they would be annihilated without even being able to react.

Of course, scaring the people present was not Chu Feng’s intention.

Thus, he only released his aura for a split second before retrieving it.

But, even with that being the case, many people still fell powerlessly to the ground in fear. Some even fainted.

Many pissed themselves in fear. Some even started weeping.

This was especially true for Xiao Yu. He was lying on the ground. His body was not just trembling, it was twitching.

Just thinking back to how he had dared to provoke an Utmost Exalted-level existence, and had even punched that Utmost Exalted-level existence, he was in so much fear that he felt like dying.

At the same time, he finally realized why his hand wouldn’t heal.

It turned out that the person he had hit was actually a paramount Utmost Exalted-level existence!

“Young friend Chu Feng, you’ve truly broadened my horizons,” the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk said at the same time.

For the others, they would at most be terrified by Chu Feng’s strength. But, for the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk, they were in complete awe.

Back in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Chu Feng had been a person of the younger generation that still needed their protection.

Yet, in the blink of an eye, he had grown so much.

He had grown to reach a level where he could easily obliterate all the monsters that they could not contend against.

It had only been several years. To martial cultivators, that amount of time was simply nothing.

Yet, in such a short period of time, Chu Feng had undergone such a massive change.

After calming down slightly, the Golden Crane True Immortal asked again, “In that case, it would mean that you’re really Chu Xuanyuan’s son?”

“Senior, why would I lie to you about that?” Chu Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He did not expect the Golden Crane True Immortal to doubt that too.

“This old man was foolish. This old man was foolish,” the Golden Crane True Immortal laughed.

“Back then, your father had stunned both of us.”

“Never would I have imagined that you’d end up stunning us even more today.”

“Truly the son of a tiger cannot possibly be a dog. Truly like father like son.”

Both the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk were sighing with admiration repeatedly.

“Lord Chu Feng.”

Suddenly, another voice was heard.

It was actually old man Zhao. Old man Zhao had a smile on his face. He was also dragging along his granddaughter, Zhao Menglu.

But, compared to the high-spirited old man Zhao, Zhao Menglu did not even dare look at Chu Feng.

Her body was also trembling uncontrollably. She looked completely dumbstruck as her grandfather dragged her along.

“Lord Chu Feng, perhaps it is inappropriate for this old man to mention this matter here.”

“But, seeing as you and Menglu have gotten along pretty well, and Menglu is also filled with endless admiration for you, if you don’t mind, I would like to betroth Menglu to you. Is that fine with you?”

Old man Zhao’s words surprised not only Chu Feng, but also the others.

Old man Zhao was simply too impatient.

He actually wanted to set up a marriage between Chu Feng and Zhao Menglu at such a time?

But, upon thinking about it, the crowd were able to understand. After all, Chu Feng was an Utmost Exalted-level expert.

Countless people would want to marry their daughters or granddaughters to someone like that.

Old man Zhao was afraid that someone else would act before him, and had decided to strike immediately.

“Senior Zhao, I’m afraid that wouldn’t do,” said Chu Feng.

“Won’t do?” Hearing those words, old man Zhao was stunned. However, he didn’t dare to say anything afterward. Instead, he smiled, “Lord Chu Feng, even if you take Menglu as a concubine it would be fine too. Menglu wouldn’t mind being a concubine. It’s all fine as long as the two of you are loving and affectionate with one another. Nothing else matters.”

Hearing his response, Chu Feng felt helpless. Finally, he said, “Senior Zhao, your granddaughter already has someone she likes.”

“Someone she likes? impossible.”

“Lord Chu Feng, please don’t listen to other people’s nonsense. My granddaughter is a well-reserved woman. Besides, in this entire place, who apart from Lord Chu Feng could possibly obtain my granddaughter’s fancy?” Old man Zhao tried his hardest to explain.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. He then pointed into the distance, at the terrified Xiao Yu, who was lying on the ground twitching, “Isn’t that person your granddaughter’s sweetheart?”
