Chapter 5581: An Opportunity And Not a Trial?

“It looks like my worry was unfounded. I didn’t expect Jie Tian to be this weak without his formation armor,” Eggy said.

“It’s not that Jie Tian is weak but Little Fishy is too powerful.” Chu Feng held onto his view that Jie Tian was a formidable world spiritist. 

Little Fishy had to be far stronger than Jie Tian to be able to defeat the latter in a single blow, but she was only a rank five Half-God level cultivator, whereas Jie Tian was an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist comparable to a rank seven Half-God level cultivator.

“That girl is ridiculously powerful,” Eggy remarked.

She hadn’t seen the two of them crossing blows, but she could tell from Little Fishy’s performance thus far that she was extremely powerful.

By then, Little Fishy was already standing in front of Chu Feng. She had such a relaxed look on her face that it didn’t look like she had just been through a battle. 

“Not bad,” Chu Feng complimented.

“Hehe!” Little Fishy mischievously stuck out her tongue at Chu Feng. 

Even though she was an adult now, she continued behaving like a mischievous child in front of Chu Feng.

“Did you get anything out of the trial?” Chu Feng asked.

He figured that the victor should receive a benefit from the trial since it was directed specifically at Little Fishy and Jie Tian. 

“I received a surge of energy to my dantian. It’s similar to the energy I previously received from the starlight formation, but it isn’t spirit power. I suspect it’ll raise my cultivation if I assimilate it, but even if that isn’t the case, it should still raise my fighting prowess,” Little Fishy said. 

“That’s good!” Chu Feng was happy on Little Fishy’s behalf, knowing that the reward from this place would be extraordinary. He glanced at the severely injured Jie Tian and asked, “Is this a bit too much?

“Is it? I already went easy on him. That trash only has himself to blame for being too brittle,” Little Fishy replied. 

“Who are you calling trash?”

Wu!

Jie Tian suddenly grabbed his head and cried in agony. Anger must have gotten the better of him after hearing Little Fishy’s provocation, invoking his killing intent. Unfortunately, the effect of Chaotic Era Scholar’s restriction formation was only temporarily nullified inside the dueling ring.

“Why are you getting punished by that formation? Were you thinking of killing me? I shouldn’t have gone easy on you. I should have outright killed you on that dueling ring,” Little Fishy said. 

Chu Feng would have taught Jie Tian a lesson for harboring killing intent toward Little Fishy, but he thought that Jie Tian had already been through enough. It was not that he was kind-hearted, but he figured that they likely still required Jie Tian’s help for the subsequent parts of the trial. 

Based on the earlier three stone tablets, he figured that the subsequent tests here might be in the order of three too. 

Boom boom boom!

All of a sudden, the walls in the hall unraveled, revealing a massive door. The door opened on its accord, revealing a scenery different from what they saw when they entered the premises. They were entering a new region. 

Hu!

Chu Feng and the others were dragged into the new world before they could examine it closely, plunging them into darkness. Chu Feng anxiously scanned his surroundings, but he couldn’t find Little Fishy or Jie Tian at all. He was certain that they were in here too, since he had seen them getting dragged into the door as well. 

“This is a formation. Another test?” Chu Feng wondered.

The world he was currently in was different from the one he had previously seen inside the door, suggesting that he had to clear this test in order to reach his destination. He tried scanning his surroundings, but he couldn’t figure out what the test was.

Shoosh shoosh!

All of a sudden, two tightly-shut copper doors fell from the sky and landed not too far away from Chu Feng. One of the copper doors was inscribed with the word ‘Body’, whereas the other one was inscribed with the word ‘Soul’.

“A once-in-a-lifetime fortuitous encounter awaits you here, but you’ll have to clear the test to obtain it. Do your best to showcase your strength, lest you miss this golden opportunity,” a voice echoed from behind the copper doors.  

Following that, the first copper door with the word ‘Body’ inscribed on it creaked open, revealing a world of blazing flames. Before Chu Feng could consider his next move, he was dragged in by a powerful force. 

The world of flames was peculiar, in the sense that its flames neither seared Chu Feng’s clothes nor body, but they brought him intense pain. Enduring the flames was already tough enough, but he figured that he had to do something more than that to clear the test. 

Thus, he tolerated the pain and tried to perceive his surroundings with his heart, hoping to figure out a solution. Soon, he stumbled upon something. 

It turned out that the flames had to be resisted, not tolerated. However, they had to be resisted with not one’s martial power nor spirit power but one’s physical resilience. Chu Feng would have to exert the might of his muscles to fight against the flames. 

However, there was a proper way to resist the flames too, and Chu Feng had already found it in the flames around him. He quickly gathered his focus before fighting against the flames with the full might of his body.  

It was effective. The intense burning sensation he was suffering from started to alleviate. Eventually, it came to a point where it didn’t hurt anymore.

Just then, a suction force pulled Chu Feng out of the world of flames and back into the world with the two copper gates. 

“It looks like I have cleared the test,” Chu Feng remarked with a sigh.

Just then, the second copper gate containing the word ‘Soul’ creaked open. Chu Feng was sucked into it before he could even catch a breather. 

He was immediately met with a cacophony of screeching sounds, including those of crying ghosts, roaring beasts, and clashing weapons. These sounds induced frustration and shook one’s psyche. Even Chu Feng felt his mind crumbling when he first heard them. 

Anyone who stayed in this place for too long would go insane. The only way to overcome them was to either adapt or resist.

However, Chu Feng’s strongest trait was his willpower. Such means that attacked his psyche tended to be ineffective on him. Furthermore, he quickly figured out that the way to overcome this trial was not to fight against the sounds but to adapt to them as quickly as possible. 

He was skilled in forcing himself to adapt to unfavorable environments through his sheer willpower, so this trial didn’t pose a problem to him.

“This isn’t right.” 

Chu Feng quickly noticed a pair of malicious eyes spying on him from the shadows, seemingly hoping to get something out of him. He didn’t know whose eyes were those; it could be the one who had spoken behind the copper doors or some other existence. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Nevertheless, it convinced him that there was something darker going on in this test. This might not be a test where he would be rewarded for doing well. Thus, he began to feign weakness by howling in pain, acting as if the test was too much for him. He hoped that this would turn those greedy eyes away from him. 

At the same time, he kept an eye out for the gaze in the shadows. 

Those eyes initially stared at him intently, but they turned away when they saw how Chu Feng was struggling with the test. 

Soon, the cacophony of noises vanished, and Chu Feng returned to the real world. The test had finally ended, and Chu Feng had failed. He lowered his head in disappointment, but he breathed a sigh of relief in his heart. 

“I hope I survived the ordeal,” Chu Feng murmured in his heart.

Weng!

Just then, there was a surge of spirit power, and Little Fishy appeared next to him. She was a little short on breath, and her complexion looked a little pale. However, she seemed to be in a good state, as she flashed a gleeful smile at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng’s heart clenched as he asked, “You cleared the test?”

“Mmhm!” Little Fishy nodded.

Chu Feng clenched his fists.

If this test was truly a calamity as he had predicted, the one who passed the test would suffer the consequences. He could only pray that Jie Tian had cleared the test as well and fared even better than Little Fishy.

Weng!

A spirit formation gate emerged, and Jie Tian fell out from within. 

Unlike Little Fishy, who had landed gracefully, Jie Tian fell on his bum with a ghastly pale face. He was so exhausted that he didn’t even have the strength to remain seated; he lay right down on the floor. He stared dazedly at the sky above, looking traumatized by the test. 

“This is bad.” Chu Feng knew that things didn’t bode well.
