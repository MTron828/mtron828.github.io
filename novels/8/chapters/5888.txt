Chapter 5889: Decision

“When do we make a move?” Chu Feng asked.

“When do you want to make a move?” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief returned the question.

“Now?” Chu Feng asked.

“That works. The journey will be dangerous. Do you intend to bring Miss Zi Ling with you?” the clan chief asked.

Before Zi Ling could reply, Chu Feng said, “She’ll be coming with me.”

He didn’t trust the Three Saints Monstrous Clan, even if they had just stabilized her injuries with a powerful formation. He would rather bring her along and brave dangers together. He had the Divine Deer anyway, so they could always flee when faced with a dangerous situation.

“There’ll be one more person joining us.” The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief formed a hand seal, and a surge of teleportation energy manifested.

Sansheng Xingyu emerged from the teleportation energy. This showed that the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief could freely control the formation within the clan.

“Father, I’ll be going too.”

Just then, a figure appeared on the horizon. It was Sansheng Qiutian. He appeared to have some kind of treasure that allowed him to thoroughly conceal himself, such that even Chu Feng was unable to detect him.

“Why are you butting in here? Get lost.” The Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief frowned. He didn’t want Sansheng Qiutian to go.

“Why can’t I go if Sansheng Xingyu is going? I’m your son!” Sansheng Qiutian wasn’t afraid of his father, though he chose to reply to his father from afar instead of coming closer.

“Stop causing trouble here and return,” the clan chief ordered.

“If you don’t let me go, I’ll tell everyone that you told me to tell Chu Feng that Sansheng Xingyu plans to take his woman in as her concubine,” Sansheng Qiutian spoke those words aloud in front of Chu Feng, Zi Ling, and Sansheng Xingyu.

“What nonsense are you spouting?” the clan chief roared with a livid face. He turned to Chu Feng and Zi Ling and said, “Don’t mind him. I spoiled him too much when he was younger, and he ended up growing up to be an unruly mess.”

Sansheng Qiutian wasn’t bothered. Instead, he continued prattling on, “Why don’t you want me to go? How about this? I’ll take the blame on your behalf if you let me go, or else you’ll have to take responsibility for it yourself.”

“Shut up! Do you think you can threaten me?” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief berated.

“I have more if this doesn’t work.”

“Fine, I’ll let you go!” the clan chief angrily bellowed. He turned to Chu Feng and Zi Ling and said with an apologetic smile, “I’m sorry, I only have this son. Who else do I spoil if not him? However, it is not as he has said. He’s talking rubbish.”

Chu Feng and Zi Ling responded with awkward smiles.

Sansheng Xingyu’s face remained nonchalant, possibly because she was used to it. It was as if there could only be one expression on her face, though that didn’t hinder her from looking pretty.

“Thank you, father!” Sansheng Qiutian ran over and bowed deeply to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.

“You brat! I’ve already let you go, so hurry up and prove my innocence!” The clan chief smacked Sansheng Qiutian’s head.

Sansheng Qiutian raised his head and grinned at Chu Feng and Zi Ling. “I was talking rubbish earlier. Chu Feng, is this your lover? She looks gorgeous. None of the women in our clan is as beautiful as her.”

Sansheng Qiutian even wiped his saliva while speaking.

“Look at you! Can you be more dignified? Haa, forget it. Shall we get moving?!” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“Lord Clan Chief!”

Just then, Elder Sheng’s voice echoed from afar.

Similarly, Chu Feng failed to sense the other party’s presence beforehand too, but unlike Sansheng Qiutian, he was doing it not through a treasure but through sheer strength.

“Paying respect to Elder Sheng.” Sansheng Xingyu and Sansheng Qiutian quickly bowed.

Chu Feng politely smiled at Elder Sheng.

Elder Sheng nodded with a smile before turning to the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. “Lord Clan Chief, there’s something I need to talk to you about. It won’t take long. Why don’t you let them go first?”

“Xingyu, bring them to the sacred mountain. Remember, you mustn’t enter the mountain until I arrive,” the clan chief instructed before leaving with Elder Sheng.

Sansheng Xingyu quickly brought Chu Feng and the others toward their destination.

While traveling over, Sansheng Qiutian secretly sent a message to Chu Feng and the others, saying, “Actually, it was my father who told me to say that. He wanted me to scare you, Chu Feng.”

“Young master Qiutian, don’t talk nonsense,” Sansheng Xingyu said.

“Tsk... I’ve already told the truth. It’s up to you whether you want to believe it or not.” Sansheng Qiutian placed his hands behind his head as he leisurely strutted forth with an upright posture.

Meanwhile, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief had entered a hidden space together with Elder Sheng.

“You’re bringing Chu Feng to challenge that formation?” Elder Sheng asked grimly. His amicable smile was nowhere to be seen.

“That’s his mission. Why else did we let him in?” the clan chief asked.

“No one has ever challenged that formation. Its difficulty is comparable to the final formation Chu Xuanyuan challenged back then, but Chu Xuanyuan has been to the sacred mountain many times before whereas this is Chu Feng’s first time. It’s too dangerous.

“You shouldn’t do this to Chu Xuanyuan’s son even if you harbor dissatisfaction toward him over what happened back then. Are you intending to make Chu Feng pay his father’s debt? It’s unlikely that Chu Xuanyuan will let it rest if something happens to Chu Feng,” Elder Sheng said.

“You said it yourself, Elder Sheng. Chu Xuanyuan’s son is the most talented junior in the world of cultivation at the moment. Not even Chu Xuanyuan had claimed that title back then, right?” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

Elder Sheng fell silent. Chu Xuanyuan had indeed never been associated with such a title.

“In a way, this means that Chu Xuanyuan’s son has surpassed him,” the clan chief said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Chu Feng’s talent and strength are indeed formidable, but the difficulty of the sacred mountain is not to be underestimated. We need to...”

Halfway through Elder Sheng’s words, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly interjected, “We don’t have time. We have already acquired whatever resources we can from our ancestors. As for the rest, we’ll have to give up on them.

“The other Ancient Era’s clans have been freed from their restraints, but our Three Saints Monstrous Clan is still stuck here. We have to leave this place as soon as possible so that we can compete for resources too, and our best shot at that is to tap into the sacred mountain’s energy.

“It’s not about exacting vengeance on Chu Xuanyuan anymore. I would have made the same decision even if it was someone else other than Chu Xuanyuan’s son. I have told Chu Feng about the risks, and he chose to go on his own accord. Furthermore, Qiutian and Xingyu are going too. If Chu Xuanyuan’s son dies, my son and goddaughter will die with him. I don’t think I have let Chu Xuanyuan down in any way,” the clan chief said.

Seeing that the clan chief had made up his mind, Elder Sheng sighed helplessly. “You should stop Qiutian. There’s no need for him to take this risk.”

“It’s Qiutian’s own decision. I respect him. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.” The clan chief turned around and headed to the sacred mountain, where Chu Feng and the others were.

Elder Sheng stood on the spot with contemplative eyes. Slowly, his eyes firmed up as if he had made a decision.
