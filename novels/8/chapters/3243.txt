Chapter 3243 - Controlling Everything

“Exactly what is going on with this guy?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Could it be that his tolerance is really this strong?”

Seeing the current appearance of Chu Feng inside his Immortal Armament Furnace, Linghu Mingye began to frown deeply. At the same time, confusion filled his eyes.

Although Chu Feng was still inside the Immortal Armament Furnace, it seemed that the flames of the Immortal Armament Furnace were completely ineffective against him now.

Linghu Mingye felt that what Chu Feng was accomplishing was no longer something that could be done through endurance.

He felt that the scene before him was very strange.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Linghu Mingye waved his sleeve. With that, the Immortal Armament Furnace began to rapidly shrink in size, and then returned to his Cosmos Sack.

As for Chu Feng, who was originally being tortured inside the Immortal Armament Furnace, he was sitting cross-legged on the ground.

Chu Feng’s eyes were still tightly closed. It was as if he had entered a state of focus, a state of training.

“What’s this? Are you pretending to be an extraordinary expert before me?” Linghu Mingye stared at the composed and focused Chu Feng with even greater displeasure in his eyes.

As for Chu Feng, he did not respond to Linghu Mingye’s provocation. In fact, not even an eyelid moved in the slightest. He reacted as if he did not hear Linghu Mingye at all.

“Do you really think that you’re an extraordinary expert?”

Linghu Mingye snorted coldly. Then, like a massive tide, his boundless rank two Martial Immortal oppressive might charged toward Chu Feng.

However, the moment his oppressive might reached Chu Feng, the power of his oppressive might decreased massively.

No, the power did not decrease massively. Instead, it had completely disappeared.

His powerful oppressive might should’ve been able to completely destroy Chu Feng. However, after it passed through Chu Feng, it did not cause the slightest damage to him.

Before Chu Feng, Linghu Mingye’s oppressive might had truly lost all of its power.

“How could this be?” Seeing that,, Linghu Mingye was no longer frowning. Instead, he raised his eyebrows as deep shock appeared in his eyes.

The change that had happened before him caused him to feel extremely surprised. In fact, he found it unfathomable.

“Woosh~~~”

Suddenly, Linghu Mingye flipped his wrist, and an Immortal Armament sword appeared in his hand.

That Immortal Armament sword of his was much more powerful than the Immortal Armament furnace from before.

Once the Immortal Armament sword appeared in his hand, Linghu Mingye’s power immediately increased enormously.

That said, Linghu Mingye did not stop with only taking out his Immortal Armament sword. A Heaven level Lightning Mark also appeared on his forehead. With that, Linghu Mingye’s cultivation increased from that of a rank two Martial Immortal to that of a rank three Martial Immortal.

“Die,” Linghu Mingye pointed his Immortal Armament at Chu Feng.

Then, a golden sword ray emerged and shot straight at Chu Feng.

As Linghu Mingye and Chu Feng were not far from one another to begin with, it seemed as if the the enormous sword ray arrived in front of Chu Feng the moment it appeared and was sent forth.

“Buzz~~~”

However, the sword ray that was so powerful that even the surrounding space was shattered. Passed through Chu Feng’s body like air after it approached him.

The sword ray still had the same form and the same power. However... it was unable to do any harm to Chu Feng.

“Damn it! This... exactly what is going on here?!”

Linghu Mingye looked to Chu Feng. His eyes were no longer only filled with deep astonishment, but they were also now filled with deep unease.

What was happening before him was simply too strange. Even he, someone who had always been filled with confidence, was no longer confident.

After all, he was a rank two Martial Immortal, and had increased his cultivation to rank three Martial Immortal with the power of his Heavenly Bloodline, whereas Chu Feng was only a rank nine Heavenly Immortal.

For a rank three Martial Immortal to not be able to take care of a rank nine Heavenly Immortal, anyone would be astonished.

“It’s useless,” right at that moment, Chu Feng, who had been quiet the entire time, slowly opened his mouth.

At the same time as Chu Feng spoke, he slowly got up and opened his eyes to look at Linghu Mingye.

“What sort of trick are you playing?”

“Could it be that there’s another treasure on your body?”

Linghu Mingye stared at Chu Feng with a stern expression. He was carefully and repeatedly inspecting Chu Feng with his eyes. He wanted to find the treasure on Chu Feng’s body.

“Whether or not I have another treasure on me and what sort of trick I’m playing are all unrelated to you.”

“You merely need to understand that, from this point forward, this Holy Spirit Formation of Light is no longer under your rule. Instead, it is under my rule.”

“As such, it’s time to settle the debt from before. Linghu Mingye, have you prepared yourself for your punishment?” Chu Feng looked at Linghu Mingye with a beaming smile on his face.

There was no trace of anger or wrath in Chu Feng’s eyes. The only thing present in his eyes was contempt. It was as if Linghu Mingye was merely a plaything in his eyes.

“Arrogant fool! No matter what sort of treasure you might possess, today... I’ll still beat you till you kneel and beg for forgiveness!”

Linghu Mingye was evidently enraged by Chu Feng. After shouting furiously at Chu Feng, his body began to emit golden light.

The golden light was covered with strange runes and symbols. Then, the golden light actually turned into golden armor that assimilated with Linghu Mingye’s aura.

At that moment, Linghu Mingye’s aura was no longer that of a rank three Martial Immortal. Instead, it had increased to that of a rank four Martial Immortal.

That golden armor of light actually managed to increase Linghu Mingye’s cultivation by an entire level.

“Is that a treasure of yours? It was actually able to increase your cultivation by an entire level. That is truly a rare treasure.”

“Mn? Not only is that treasure itself exceptional, but it actually managed to fuse with your soul. To fuse one’s treasure with one’s soul is no easy task. It would appear that the Linghu Heavenly Clan has exhausted great wealth on you.”

Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that the golden armor transformed by the golden light was a treasure. Furthermore, that treasure was very exceptional, and had been fused with Linghu Mingye’s soul through special techniques.

In other words, it would be impossible for others to plunder that treasure from him.

Even if Linghu Mingye were killed, it would still be useless. The reason for that was because after he died, that treasure would also disappear together with his soul.

That was the reason why Chu Feng said that the Linghu Heavenly Clan had exhausted great wealth on Linghu Mingye. The reason for that was because one must go through enormous effort to fuse a treasure with one’s soul.

Although Chu Feng had no idea what sort of price the Linghu Heavenly Clan paid for it, he knew that it was an enormous price.

“Since you understand, it will still not be too late for you to kneel and beg me for forgiveness,” Linghu Mingye said to Chu Feng.

“I’ve already told you that I, Chu Feng, am now the one in charge of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. Not to mention your cultivation having increased to that of a rank four Martial Immortal, even if your cultivation were that of an Exalted, you would still be under my complete control in this Holy Spirit Formation of Light.”

“You... are already under my dominion,” Chu Feng pointed to Linghu Mingye.

“Arrogance!” Linghu Mingye shouted and slashed his Immortal Armament at Chu Feng.

This time around, Linghu Mingye was not using a technique from afar. Instead, he had flown toward Chu Feng. He planned to personally slash Chu Feng in two.

“Buzz~~~”

However, when the Immortal Armament sword in his hand was only an inch away from Chu Feng, it actually stopped.

Chu Feng was right before him. However, Linghu Mingye was unable to cut him.

“What is this?!”

“Exactly what is this?!”

Linghu Mingye was completely bewildered, and became frantic.

He felt as if he were going to be driven to a state of insanity. He had already unleashed all of his abilities, yet he was actually unable to cause any harm to Chu Feng.

This caused him to feel completely lost as to what to do, and he felt completely powerless.

“It seems that you still don’t understand. Did I not explain myself clearly?”

“Since that’s the case, I will explain myself again in a clearer manner.”

“This Holy Spirit Formation of Light is now under my control. Everything inside this Holy Spirit Formation of Light is under my control. Naturally, that includes you,” Chu Feng pointed to Linghu Mingye.

“Bullshit! Someone like you dares to proclaim that you control the Holy Spirit Formation of Light?!” Linghu Mingye spoke with an expression of disbelief.

“It seems that you still do not believe me. Since that’s the case, I’ll have to demonstrate it to you.”

Chu Feng smiled. Then, his gaze turned cold. Softly, he shouted, “Kneel.”

The next moment, with a ‘putt,’ Linghu Mingye... actually knelt before Chu Feng.
