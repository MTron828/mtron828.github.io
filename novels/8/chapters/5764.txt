Chapter 5764: Divine Body Ranking

A two-meter-tall person was standing in front of Wang Qiang’s residence. He was wearing a cloak that concealed his appearance.

“Chu Feng, Master Liu Kuo, a-are you here to look for Wang Qiang too?” that person asked.

Despite his towering height and mysterious appearance, he had a gentle voice. He had clearly heard about Chu Feng and Liu Kuo, or else he wouldn’t have recognized them so quickly.

“Yes, we are here to look for Wang Qiang. Are you here to look for him too?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am here to look for him too,” that person replied with a nod.

“May I know who you are?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am Yuwen Yanri. Like Wang Qiang, I am from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion too,” that person said.

He took off his cloak, revealing a ghastly pale face with sunken cheeks. He was so emaciated that he looked just like a skeleton covered in skin. It wasn’t hot, yet he was sweating profusely.

“My apologies. My appearance is a little frightening. If you don’t mind…” that person said as he reached for his cloak.

He had taken off his cloak to reveal his true appearance out of respect, and he wanted to put it back on lest it was too jarring for Chu Feng and Liu Kuo. This showed that he was a person with courtesy.

But the weird thing was that he was Yuwen Yanri.

Chu Feng had heard about Yuwen Yanri—he was the grandson of the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion’s Mansion Master, and his father was a prodigy who once towered above his peers in the world of cultivation.

Yuwen Yanri had always been a secretive figure, such that few in the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion had seen him. Chu Feng didn’t think that he would be such a humble person, which gave him a good first impression of the other party.

“I personally don’t mind your appearance, but please feel free if you mind,” Chu Feng said.

“Thank you,” Yuwen Yanri replied as he put his cloak on.

“May I know why you’re looking for Wang Qiang?” Chu Feng asked.

“There’s something wrong with Wang Qiang’s body. I’m worried about him,” Yuwen Yanri replied.

“Do you know what’s wrong with his body?” Chu Feng asked.

He was almost certain that Wang Qiang’s problem was related to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, but he wanted to see if he could learn more about it from Yuwen Yanri.

“It’s about his cultivation, but I’m not sure about the details,” Yuwen Yanri said.

“Let’s enter together then,” Chu Feng said.

“Benefactors, I won’t be accompanying you.” Liu Kuo channeled the formation to open Wang Qiang’s residence before taking his leave.

Chu Feng and Yuwen Yanri entered the residence and found Wang Qiang cultivating in the cultivation ground. The latter was so focused on his cultivation that he didn’t notice Chu Feng and Yuwen Yanri’s presence.

At first glance, Chu Feng couldn’t find anything wrong with Wang Qiang’s body.

“Don’t worry, he’s fine,” Chu Feng told Yuwen Yanri.

“That’s a relief.” Yuwen Yanri breathed a sigh of relief before turning to Chu Feng. “Erm… Brother Chu Feng, I heard you’re Elder Jie Ranqing’s son? I-I don’t mean any disrespect by asking that! I’ve heard about Elder Jie Ranqing’s feat, and I respect her even though we have never met. But as you know, there are many falsehoods going around the world of cultivation, so I wanted to verify it.”

He spoke carefully as if fearing that he would unintentionally hurt Chu Feng.

“The rumor is true,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“What an honor to be acquainted with Elder Jie Ranqing’s son,” Yuwen Yanri replied as he took a respectful bow to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng quickly returned the bow. “It’s my honor to be acquainted with Brother Yuwen too.”

“Brother Chu Feng, you heard about me?” Yuwen Yanri was flattered as if it was a huge honor for Chu Feng to have heard about him.

“It’s a little embarrassing. I’m from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, which has barely any interactions with the other galaxies, so I’m not up to date with the latest news. It’s only upon arriving at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith that I heard about you. My friends are all quite curious about you, as you are quite the elusive figure yourself,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Brother Chu Feng, it’s not that I want to be secretive but that my grandfather doesn’t allow me to leave the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion. I had to beg him for a long time before he relented. When I arrived here, I was worried I’d scare others with my looks, so…” Yuwen Yanri explained.

“I understand. Brother Yuwen, I noticed that your complexion didn’t look good. Are you feeling unwell? I am a world spiritist. If you need help, I can take a look for you,” Chu Feng replied.

“My condition is similar to that of Brother Wang Qiang. It isn’t an illness but a problem with my cultivation. My body is healthy,” Yuwen Yanri replied.

“That’s good to hear,” Chu Feng replied.

“Eh! W-w-w-why are the two of you here?” It was then that Wang Qiang stopped his cultivation, and he immediately noticed the two of them.

Chu Feng quickly filled in the blanks for Wang Qiang.

Yuwen Yanri chatted with Wang Qiang for a bit and took his leave. He could tell that Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were on close terms, so he wanted to give them some private space.

“Yuwen Yanri is different from how I expected him to be,” Chu Feng said.

“R-r-right! Yuwen Yanri i-i-is an innocent guy. I have n-n-n-never met a young master as innocent a-a-and kind as him. Y-y-you shouldn’t underestimate him j-j-just because he looks like a pushover. He’s v-v-very strong!” Wang Qiang said.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“How strong is he?” Chu Feng asked.

“V-v-very strong! S-s-stronger than me!” Wang Qiang said.

“Oh?” Chu Feng was surprised, as he knew that Wang Qiang was extremely strong now.

“C-C-Chu Feng, do you know the Divine Body R-R-Ranking passed down from the A-A-Ancient Era?” Wang Qiang asked.

“I’m aware of its existence, but I don’t know the exact ranking,” Chu Feng replied.

“Hehe!” Wang Qiang smiled in glee. He stood up and tidied his clothes before placing his hands behind his back and tilting his chin up. “T-t-then I should b-b-brag a bit. I know the r-r-ranking.”

“Oh? Please educate me,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“In the t-t-tenth place is m-m-my Four Fiends Divine Body. T-t-that old thing, Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, didn’t lie to me about that,” Wang Qiang said.

Chu Feng knew about the Four Fiends Divine Body, as Wang Qiang had previously told him about it.

“What about the ninth place?”

“In the ninth place is the R-R-Reincarnation Upper Body,” Wang Qiang replied.

“Reincarnation Upper Body?” Chu Feng’s heart skipped a beat.

He knew that Zhao Hong possessed the Reincarnation Upper Body. He had heard that it was a legendary Divine Body, but who could have thought that it was stronger than Wang Qiang’s Four Fiends Divine Body?

Chu Feng only learned about this later on, so Wang Qiang must still be unaware that his wife’s Divine Body was stronger than his.

“In the e-e-eighth place is the Brilliant Moon Divine Body.”

“In the s-s-seventh place is the Blazing Sun Divine Body. T-t-the Blazing Sun Divine Body is the s-s-strongest Divine Body of the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion. I-i-it can be passed down from one generation to another, and Yuwen Yanri i-i-is its current inheritor,” Wang Qiang said.
