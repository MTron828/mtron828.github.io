Chapter 4185 - Sequence Of Events

“Zi Ling is currently in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.”

Yu Ting began to tell Chu Feng about Zi Ling’s circumstances in detail.

It turned out that Zi Ling had originally been training in a forbidden area within the Holy Light Galaxy.

Whilst training she had been discovered by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster, who had taken a fancy to her.

Because of that, Zi Ling had ended up entering the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect as a disciple.

Not only that, she has also become the only personal disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster.

As a newcomer, Zi Ling had immediately become the focus of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

All the disciples and elders were very curious as to exactly what had made their sectmaster take such a fancy to Zi Ling as to be willing to personally train her.

As time passed, Zi Ling did not disappoint them.

She made rapid progress. Soon, she became the most well-known person in the entire Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and was deemed to be the person with the greatest talent in the entire sect.

Even though Zi Ling had only been in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for a short period of time, many people had already considered her to be the successor to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster.

However, at such a time, Zi Ling suddenly insisted on leaving the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. She said she needed to go out for an important matter.

But, according to the rules of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, no one was allowed to leave without the sectmaster’s permission.

If anyone left the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect without permission, they would have committed a capital offense.

During that time, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster was planning to personally train Zi Ling. As such, she was not allowed to leave.

Yet, Zi Ling had insisted on leaving.

Finally, Zi Ling’s insistence had ended up angering the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s Sectmaster.

Because of that, he had imprisoned her in their Land of Abandonment.

The Land of Abandonment was a place where those that had committed major blunders would be imprisoned.

Those that ended up there would never be able to return.

Even if they were to die, they would die in there. They would no longer have any freedom for the rest of their lives.

“Damn it!”

Upon learning of the calamity that Zi Ling had suffered, Chu Feng immediately erupted in anger.

“Back then, none of us understood Zi Ling. Even I hadn’t understood her.”

“It was only afterwards that she was finally willing to tell me the reason for her actions.”

“It turned out that the reason why she had insisted on leaving the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect back then was because of you.”

Yu Ting’s words caused Chu Feng so much grief that his heart was about to split open. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was an indescribable amount of pain.

“She wanted to see you, to help you.”

“Even her training and her desire to become stronger was all for you.”

“But, she didn’t dare mention it to anyone. She was afraid that you would end up suffering at the hands of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,” Yu Ting continued.

Actually, even without Yu Ting telling him, Chu Feng could guess the reason why Zi Ling wanted to leave the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

But, after he heard the reasoning from Yu Ting’s mouth, Chu Feng’s heartache grew even more intense.

If it wasn’t for him, Zi Ling wouldn’t have suffered so much.

Suddenly, Yu Ting asked Chu Feng, “Do you want to save her?”

“I do. Of course I do,” said Chu Feng.

“Even if you might die, you’re still willing to attempt her rescue?” asked Yu Ting.

“I am.” After saying that, Chu Feng immediately asked, “Miss Yu Ting, do you know of a way to rescue Zi Ling? If you do, please tell me.”

“There is indeed a way to rescue her. However, it’s very dangerous,” said Yu Ting.

“I’m willing to give any method a try. Miss Yu Ting, please tell me what it is,” urged Chu Feng.

“I’ve already told you that it’s useless for you to panic now.”

“Rescuing Zi Ling is not that easy of a task. You will have to take your time and plan things at length,” Yu Ting called Chu Feng to attention in a very serious manner.

“Okay.” Chu Feng immediately began to calm his state of mind.

Seeing that Chu Feng had calmed down, Yu Ting finally spoke, “Our Sectmaster treasures talents greatly. If it wasn’t for Zi Ling’s insistence which had ended up angering our sectmaster, she wouldn’t have been imprisoned in the Land of Abandonment.”

“According to my knowledge, whilst the Land of Abandonment is filled with dangers, one will not immediately die after being imprisoned there. Instead, one will end up spending the remainder of their life there alone, and then finally die a tragic death.”

“That, however, is a very long process.”

“Thus, if you want to rescue Zi Ling, there is still time.”

“But, you must become the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s strongest disciple. Only with that will you have an opportunity to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s forbidden area. The entrance to the Land of Abandonment is located within the forbidden area,” said Yu Ting.

“Miss Yu Ting, please bring me to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,” said Chu Feng.

Chu Feng did not doubt Yu Ting’s words.

Since Yu Ting knew these things about Zi Ling and also had her little purple bell, it meant that she was someone Zi Ling trusted a lot.

Since she was someone that Zi Ling trusted, Chu Feng would naturally also trust her.

“It’s not that easy to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Even though I escaped from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, it is impossible for me to find the way back,” said Yu Ting.

“Es-escaped?”

Hearing the word ‘escape,’ Chu Feng realized something.

Zi Ling’s trouble could have very possibly implicated the girl before him.

After all, she had told him that leaving the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect without permission was a capital offense.

“If I didn’t escape, how was I supposed to find you?”

“It was actually Zi Ling who told me the way to escape.”

“Do you know why Zi Ling told me about you and gave me this little bell?”

“That’s because in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, I am the only friend Zi Ling trusts.”

“Of course, she is also the only friend I trust.”

“She was afraid that her escape would fail, and knew what would become of her if she failed.”

“Because of that, she told me about you, and gave me this little bell.”

“She told me to seek an opportunity to find you if something ended up happening to her.”

“If the opportunity never presented itself, she told me not to insist on it. But, if the opportunity did present itself, she wanted me to return this little bell to you.”

“She also wanted me to tell you that she’d gone far away, and to not seek her out and not worry about her. She said that she would take care of herself, and come find you when the time is right,” said Yu Ting.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart grew even more pained.

“That girl Zi Ling, she’s still thinking about me at such a time.”

As Chu Feng blamed himself for what had happened to Zi Ling, he also felt very blessed.

It was his fortune to have a woman like her love him.

“I can tell that you and Zi Ling have a very close relationship.”

“Else, you wouldn’t brave death to come find me,” Chu Feng said to Yu Ting.

“I came to find you not only to help Zi Ling, but also to help myself,” said Yu Ting.

“Help yourself?” Chu Feng was confused by Yu Ting’s words.

“The escape method Zi Ling found is completely fine. The fact that I was able to escape successfully is testimony to that.”

“Originally, Zi Ling had planned to escape after bidding farewell to me.”

“It was me who urged her...”

“I was the one who urged her to consult our sectmaster, to plead with him some more to allow her to leave.”

“But, after Zi Ling went to see the sectmaster, she never returned.”

“Instead, she was imprisoned in the Land of Abandonment...”

After telling him this, Yu Ting lowered her head.

Chu Feng could see the guilt on her face.
