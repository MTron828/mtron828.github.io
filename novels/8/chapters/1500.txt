MGA: Chapter 1501 - Asking A Martial Emperor

“Since we’re all here, let’s set off directly. The Cursed Soil Sect is vicious and merciless, if we end up being late, I’m afraid that harm might occur to Chu Feng’s friend,” Miao Renlong said.

“No, we must still go to our designated place first,” Dugu Xingfeng said.

“You still need to go to that village?” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master asked in a confused manner.

“No, that is no ordinary village,” Dugu Xingfeng explained.

“Headmaster Dugu, although I do not know why you need to go there, we are all gathered here now for the sake of helping Chu Feng rescue his friend. The way I see it, shouldn’t we place that matter as the most important? If you have something else that you must take care of, it wouldn’t be too late to do so later, no?” Hong Qiang asked.

Although Hong Qiang was not a headmaster of the Nine Powers, he possessed strength that was comparable to that of the Nine Powers’ headmasters. Thus, he was able to speak without reserve, and did not even fear Dugu Xingfeng. His attitude was very unrestrained.

“Brother Hong Qiang, I understand what you mean. That is also the reason why I said that we need to go there. The reason why I want us to go there is so that we can save Chu Feng’s friend,” Dugu Xingfeng said.

“Oh?” Hearing what Dugu Xingfeng said, the others started to hesitate. They did not understand what sort of relationship the Cursed Soil Sect would have with that Cyanwood Domain’s ancient village.

“Perhaps you all do not know about this matter. However... I do.”

“The origin of the Cursed Soil Sect is one that practices corrupt methods. The cultivation techniques that they train in, as well as all of their abilities and skills, are extremely nefarious.”

“There is a lot of shamefulness that cannot be brought to light in the Cursed Soil Sect. The more shameful something is, the more it cannot be brought to light. Thus, the Cursed Soil Sect is the most tightly-guarded place in the Nine Powers and possesses the most perfect protective formation in all of the Nine Powers.”

“We know that too,” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master interrupted.

“I am not finished yet. I know that you all know about all the things I said earlier. However, what I am going to say is something that you all definitely do not know about.”

“In the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly, there is a person called the Fiend Emperor. Do you all know about that?” Dugu Xingfeng asked.

“Of course we do. He is one of several great Martial Emperors of the Cursed Soil Sect. Among them, the Fiend Emperor is said to be the most vicious and merciless, the one who would use any means to obtain his goal, the most notorious of the bunch. His infamy is widespread; no one does not know about him,” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master said.

“In that case, do you know who the Fiend Emperor’s son is?” Dugu Xingfeng asked.

“That...” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master was unable to answer that. He looked to Hong Qiang and Miao Renlong. Like him, the two of them were not able to answer the question. Evidently, they did not know who he was.

“I can tell you all this. The Fiend Emperor’s son is the current headmaster of the Cursed Soil Sect, Sang Kun,” Dugu Xingfeng said.

“It’s actually him? He’s actually the Fiend Emperor’s son?” Hearing what Dugu Xingfeng said, Miao Renlong and the others were all surprised.

“The Fiend Emperor has had at least several hundred sons. However, because those sons of his did not possess a talent for martial cultivation that was up to his standards, they would either end up being strangled to death or trained to death by him.”

“In the end, only Sang Kun remained. Thus, Sang Kun is extremely valued and loved by the Fiend Emperor. He was also declared as his successor.”

“Right now, the Fiend Emperor is not training in the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly. Instead, he is training in the Cursed Soil Sect itself. The reason he is doing that is so that he can help his son protect the Cursed Soil Sect.”

“Although we will only be going to the Cursed Soil Sect to rescue someone from the younger generation, our statuses are all a bit special. I believe none of you would want to expose your identity, and furthermore, you all would want this rescue to be a sure success.”

“Otherwise, if we are to expose ourselves, it will not only be us who will be out of luck. Instead, we will implicate both the Cyanwood Mountain and the World Spiritist Alliance’s relationship with the Cursed Soil Sect.”

“The Cursed Soil Sect is not on good terms with any of us to begin with. If this matter were to be exposed, it would inevitably lead to war. Countless elders and disciples will die because of this. And we — we will become the main cause of this disaster. We will all become sinners.”

“Thus, we cannot afford to make the slightest mistake in this journey. We must plan thoroughly.” Dugu Xingfeng said.

“In that case, what plan might you have, and what relationship does it have with that village?” Hong Qiang asked.

“That is no ordinary village.”

“It is a village that might end up assisting us.”

“I might as well just tell you all directly. I wish to go to that village to ask for a Martial Emperor to help us,” Dugu Xingfeng said.

“What? Martial Emperor?” Hearing those words, Miao Renlong and the others were surprised. At the same time, they became excited.

Although colossal powers like the Nine Powers all possessed Martial Emperors to watch over them, it remained that Martial Emperors were the peak existences in the Holy Land of Martialism.

Martial Emperors were existences completely above the rest of the world. They were existences akin to gods in the eyes of not only ordinary people, but also many cultivators. For existences like them, how could it be so easy to request their help?

However, at this moment, Dugu Xingfeng said that he was planning to request the help of a Martial Emperor. This inevitably caused Miao Renlong, the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master and Hong Qiang to be excited.

To be able to fight alongside a Martial Emperor was one’s fortune. Furthermore, if they were truly able to obtain the help of a Martial Emperor, then this journey of theirs would definitely be certain to end in success.

“Could it be that a senior from the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly is in that village?” Hong Qiang asked.

“No, that wouldn’t be possible. Seniors from the Sacred Assembly would never meddle with something like this. Even though Brother Dugu is a headmaster, he would still not be able to obtain the help of a senior from the Sacred Assembly in a matter like this. If he were to mention this, after they consider all of the things involved, not only would they not help, they would also not allow Brother Dugu to interfere,” Miao Renlong said.

“What Brother Miao says is correct. The seniors of our Cyanwood Sacred Assembly will always place the greater good ahead of everything else. They would not participate in something as dangerous as this,” Dugu Xingfeng nodded.

“In that case, could it be that the person in the village is a hidden Martial Emperor?” Hearing what Dugu Xingfeng said, Miao Renlong and the others grew even more excited. Even Chu Feng became excited.

In the Holy Land of Martialism, the Three Palaces, Four Clans and Nine Powers could be said to be the strongest existences. At the same time, they were also the most famous colossal powers. All of them were headed by Martial Emperors. Furthermore, there were more Martial Emperors in the Three Palaces and the Four Clans.

However, other than these powers, there were also a lot of many hidden powers, as well as hidden Martial Emperors.

The majority of these hidden Martial Emperors possessed a common feature. That is, they were all very mysterious.

They were mysterious because they were very low-profile individuals. However, the more mysterious they were, the more curious of them would others be. Thus, compared to famous and well-known Martial Emperors, these hidden Martial Emperors were existences who people wished to pay their respects to even more.

“Everyone finally managed to guess correctly. However, this individual is no ordinary Martial Emperor. His origin is extremely grand,” Dugu Xingfeng said.

“Exactly what is his origin?” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master asked. At this moment, he was exceptionally excited and had already lost the calmness that a headmaster should possess.

“I think that you all have heard of the Flame Emperor, right?” Dugu Xingfeng asked.

“Flame Emperor? Of course we know about him. He is the person that fought against Emperor Qing ten thousand years ago for the status of that era’s overlord.”

“Although he ended up being defeated by Emperor Qing, the Flame Emperor’s might is definitely not an undeserved one. Once, in anger, he burned several tens of thousands of miles and completely dried up a large sea with his flames, turning it into a sea of flames.”

“Although it has been ten thousand years, the sea of flames that the Flame Emperor left behind is still burning. It is a forbidden area that none of us dare to step onto,” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master said.

“Rumor has it that there had been several Martial Emperor-level experts who suspected that there were treasures left behind by the Flame Emperor in that sea of flames and decided to proceed into it to search. However, once they entered, they never came back. They all lost their lives to that sea of flames.”

“Thus, that vast and boundless sea of flames is known as the Purgatory Sea of Flames. It is one of the more relatively well-known forbidden areas in our Holy Land of Martialism, a place that not even Martial Emperors dare to rashly enter,” Miao Renlong added.

“There are a lot of forbidden areas in the Holy Land of Martialism. However, the majority of them are places from the Ancient Era. As for the ones that have been created by our era’s experts, they number very few. However, the Purgatory Sea of Flames is one such place.”

“The might of the Flame Emperor is indeed not something that any of us could compare with,” When mentioning this matter, Hong Qiang was also very knowledgeable.

As for Chu Feng, this was the first time he had heard about the Flame Emperor. However, he was able to hear from the tone of his seniors that they all admired and worshipped this Flame Emperor. As such, he determined that this Flame Emperor was most definitely not someone simple. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

For him to have fought against Emperor Qing for the status of overlord of their era, it meant that this Flame Emperor was someone who possessed the power to strive for the title of the strongest individual.

“But, isn’t Emperor Yan long dead?” Suddenly, the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master, Hong Qiang and Miao Renlong asked simultaneously.
