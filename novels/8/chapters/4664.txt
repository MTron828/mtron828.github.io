Chapter 4664: Framing

The Wretched Black Demon’s furious roar echoed a far distance away.

The crowd who were still waiting on the square for the results of the final trial looked at one another with a tense look on their faces, but there was a hint of a gleeful smile on their lips.

They had heard the content of what the Wretched Black Demon shouted too—he wanted Chu Feng and his family to die!

This only went to say that Chu Feng had done something that riled up the Wretched Black Demon.

To be honest, as people from the Nine Souls Galaxy, it wasn’t their wish to see someone rising from the Holy Light Galaxy. It was only because the Wretched Black Demon kept protecting Chu Feng earlier that they dared not to do anything to him.

However, if the Wretched Black Demon had really made up his mind to deal with Chu Feng, there was no way Chu Feng would be getting out of here alive. This was in line with what they hoped for.

“Lord Clan Chief, that sounds like Lord Black Demon’s voice!”

Those from the Gongsun Clan turned to look at their clan chief with gleeful smiles on their faces.

“Yes, I’m not deaf. I heard it loud and clear,” the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief replied with a smile.

He hated Chu Feng deeply for having embarrassed their Gongsun Clan today, so it would be a good thing if Chu Feng died here today. At the very least, his fury would be quenched.

Shoosh!

But while everyone was speculating amongst themselves, a silhouette suddenly appeared in the sky. It was no other than the Wretched Black Demon.

The Wretched Black Demon had already calmed down a little by now, but his face was still extremely livid. Sensing the tense atmosphere in the air, everyone quickly shut their mouths out of fear.

“Lord Black Demon, we heard your words earlier. What did Chu Feng do to incur your rage? Tell us, and we’ll definitely deal with that Chu Feng in your stead.”

It was the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief who spoke up first.

He was one of the few who had the standing and qualification to speak up in such a situation, and he was extremely curious as to what had happened too.

“I have misjudged Chu Feng. My trust in him was misplaced. I told Chu Feng and young friend Yuntian not to harm one another in the final examination, and that harmony is of greater importance, but who could have thought that Chu Feng...”

Speaking up to this point, the Wretched Black Demon’s voice suddenly trailed off as he looked at the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief with eyes filled with remorse.

This made everyone realize that something was amiss here.

“M-Milord, what did Chu Feng do? Yuntian... is he still safe?”

Out of nervousness, the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief actually started stuttering halfway through his words.

“Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief, I have to regrettably inform you to young friend Gongsun Yuntian has been killed by Chu Feng. Even his body has been completely destroyed,” the Wretched Black Demon said.

“AHH!!!”

The Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief felt energy sapping away from his limbs as he saw the world spinning around him. He staggered backward weakly, and the crowd from the Gongsun Clan quickly rushed forward to support him.

It was a huge blow to the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief.

One must know that Gongsun Yuntian was the future hope of the Gongsun Clan. He was still pinning his hopes on Gongsun Yuntian bringing the Gongsun Clan to greater heights, but Gongsun Yuntian actually lose his life!

“Lord Black Demon, are you... joking? I have set up a protective formation on Yuntian. There’s no one I wouldn’t sense anything if an accident really occurred to him!”

The Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief took a while to calm down before posing his question once more.

“Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief, Chu Feng’s means aren’t as simple as you think. He’s even able to escape under my eyelids. Do you think that the protective formation you set up can really stop him?” the Wretched Black Demon said.

Upon hearing those words, the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief reached out toward his Cosmos Sack with trembling hands. He carefully took out a wooden box made out of spirit power and pried it open.

There was a row of pearls inside.

Every single pearl had a person’s name, just not the very first one. The first pearl had already shattered into pieces.

“O’ heaven, why must you treat our Gongsun Clan in such a manner!”

Seeing the shattered pearl, the Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief let loose a grieved howl before his eyes rolled over. He had fainted.

“Chu Feng, our Gongsun Clan will never let you off!”

Everyone from the Gongsun Clan roared in fury. They knew that the shattered pearl was Gongsun Clan’s Life Pearl. It would only shatter when Gongsun Yuntian was dead.

“Milord, has Chu Feng really escaped?”

The crowd from the Gongsun Clan asked.

They knew the Wretched Black Demon’s capability very well. He was a feared name by all in the Nine Souls Galaxy. If Chu Feng was really able to escape from his hands, it would mean that Chu Feng was much more formidable than they had thought.

“It’s my incompetence that allowed Chu Feng to get away. However, you need not worry. Since Chu Feng dares to mess around in my territory, this is no longer a matter of the Gongsun Clan’s anymore. I won’t let that brat off either.

“Everyone here can bear witness to my words. If anyone manages to capture Chu Feng alive, I’ll reward him handsomely!”

The Wretched Black Demon spoke grandly to both the Gongsun Clan and the crowd around.

While the Wretched Black Demon’s reassurance was of some consolation to the Gongsun Clan, they still looked incredibly despaired. Gongsun Yuntian was simply too important to them.

Afterward, the Wretched Black Demon also declared that the matchmaking convention had been annulled.

Everyone could understand the reason behind that verdict. Given everything that had happened, there was no way the marriage convention would continue on.

As a result, everyone quickly scattered and returned.

However, what they didn’t know was that the culprit who killed Gongsun Yuntian wasn’t Chu Feng but the Wretched Black Demon. It was only out of malice that the Wretched Black Demon decided to frame it all on Chu Feng. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yet, no one doubted his words at all. On the contrary, they trusted him deeply.

What was worthy of mention was that the Gongsun Clan was still hoping to capture Xiao Yu and Xia Yan. While, on the surface, it didn’t seem like they had any close relationship with Chu Feng—their alliance had only been one of convenience—the Gongsun Clan didn’t wish to leave any stones unturned.

It was just a pity that those two fellows had already left in advance, such that even the Wretched Black Demon couldn’t find them.

As a result, those from the Gongsun Clan could only return in resignation.

What they needed to do now was to announce the death of Gongsun Yuntian and release a kill order on Chu Feng. They would mobilize the full forces of the Gongsun Clan for this while engaging the help of the public through a bounty.

Regardless of the cost, they were determined to get rid of Chu Feng so as to avenge Gongsun Yuntian.

And after a moment of journeying, the Gongsun Clan finally returned back to the world they ruled over. However, as soon as they stepped out of their teleportation formation, they found themselves blocked by a silhouette.

Taking a closer look, their eyes widened in bewilderment. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

It was a familiar face blocking their path. It was the person whom they were looking for but was nowhere to be found—Xiao Yu!
