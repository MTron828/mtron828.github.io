Chapter 5085: Insults of the Weak

The world fell silent. Everyone was dumbfounded.

Putting aside the cultivators from the Nine Souls Galaxy, even Wang Yuxian, the Lady of Dao Sea, Jiang Taibai, and the others were flabbergasted too.

Chu Feng’s final slash was shockingly fast compared to his previous attacks, to the point that it was hard to believe that he was the one who had executed it. Something appeared to be amiss here.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng stopped his attack. In his view, there was no longer any reason to continue this duel.

“Looks like it’s my victory,” Chu Feng said with a chuckle.

Jiang Yuantai was stunned. Even though he was bleeding profusely from the severing of his arm, he made no move to heal himself. He was simply too bewildered by what had just happened.

I… was defeated?

While he had only consumed one forbidden medicine, his strength and mastery of the spear should have been enough to block Chu Feng’s earlier slash. Yet, he was somehow unable to do so, which resulted in his defeat.

“What did you do?” Jiang Yuantai asked coldly.

Indignance was brimming in his eyes.

“Big brother, he consumed my forbidden medicine,” Jiang Kongping spoke up before Chu Feng could.

“Forbidden medicine?”

Jiang Yuantai quickly turned to look at his younger brother, Jiang Kongping.

“Chu Feng took away my Cosmos Sack back then when he captured me. It contains three forbidden medicines from our Pill Dao Immortal Sect. He must have found a way to open our Cosmos Sack to acquire my forbidden medicine. The sudden rise in his fighting prowess must have come from that,” Jiang Kongping said.

Then, he turned to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, you might have defeated my older brother today, but you didn’t win fair and square. You won only with the help of our forbidden medicine.”

“Are you admitting that your older brother has consumed forbidden medicine in the previous duel?” Chu Feng asked.

“You have no evidence to prove that my older brother has consumed forbidden medicine,” Jiang Kongping replied.

He knew just how prideful his older brother was, so there was no way he could admit that his older brother had relied on their forbidden medicine to defeat Chu Feng.

“No evidence? I noticed a sudden rise in Jiang Yuantai’s fighting prowess earlier, similar to the last time I fought with him. If your older brother consumed forbidden medicine, it should only be a matter of time before he suffers its backlash. Why don’t we just wait for a while and see who is right?” Chu Feng said.

Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect panicked upon hearing those words. They wanted to argue against Chu Feng, but it was a fact that Jiang Yuantai would soon face the backlash of the forbidden medicine at this rate.

The backlash was less severe than that of other forbidden medicine, but the symptoms would be apparent. Jiang Yuantai wouldn’t be able to conceal it. The truth was going to be exposed at this rate.

“So what if we consumed forbidden medicine? Didn’t you do the same too?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The others from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect eventually pointed their fingers to Chu Feng.

They wouldn’t want to admit to this matter if possible, but seeing that it was no longer possible to hide it, they could only cling to the fact that Chu Feng had also violated the rules of the duel by consuming forbidden medicine.

“Regardless of whether I consumed forbidden medicine or not, it’s a fact that I’ve won,” Chu Feng said.

“You might have won, but it’s not a glorious victory. You must have consumed the gray forbidden medicine for your strength to have grown by so much. Didn’t you request for us to wait it out? Sure, let’s do just that. Let’s see who suffers the worst backlash!” Jiang Taibai said.

The abrupt surge in the speed of Chu Feng’s final slash made him certain that Chu Feng had consumed their forbidden medicine. Furthermore, it shouldn’t be possible for Chu Feng to overpower Jiang Yuantai given the latter’s mastery in spearmanship. Taking these into consideration, it was likely that Chu Feng had consumed a more potent forbidden medicine than Jiang Yuantai.

If so, Chu Feng would suffer a backlash sooner and more severely than Jiang Yuantai.

It was a fact that Jiang Yuantai had lost, but if they could prove that Chu Feng had consumed a more potent forbidden medicine, they could assert that Chu Feng had won unfairly. That was also the reason behind his words.

“You want to wait it out? Sure, let’s do that.”

Chu Feng crossed his legs and sat down.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yuantai glared intently at Chu Feng, not saying a word or moving at all. His gaze looked extremely terrifying. Anyone else would have been intimidated by Jiang Yuantai’s gaze, but Chu Feng was hardly fazed at all.

“What’s going on?”

Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect looked at each other.

Given their knowledge of their forbidden medicine, Chu Feng should have already suffered the backlash by now. Yet, his complexion still looked as glowing as ever. It didn’t seem like he was in pain at all.

“Wu!”

A while later, Jiang Yuantai let out a soft harrumph. A frown formed on his forehead, and he gritted his teeth. Beads of sweat flowed down his cheeks.

“Someone has indeed consumed forbidden medicine, but it isn’t my disciple but the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect! So much for all his talk about having a fair duel. It turns out that he’s a hypocrite! I thought that it was weird how he suddenly became stronger in the middle of the duel, and it turns out he has been relying on the power of forbidden medicine all this while!” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist ridiculed.

“Shut up, you old thing!”

How could those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect tolerate an outsider insulting their young master? They began berating the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. If not for Sima Xiangtu clearly telling them that he had a use for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, they would have already made a move to kill him.

“Are you going to forbid others from telling the truth now? We’re all cultivators here. Do you really think that no one has noticed it?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied nonchalantly.

He turned to the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy around him and asked, “Everyone, don’t you think what I’ve said made sense? So much for being a powerhouse of the world of cultivation. A bunch of scums with no dignity at all, that’s what the Pill Dao Immortal Sect is!”

His words immediately won the approval of the crowd.

“Indeed, they are all shameless bastards!”

“Utterly disgusting. They put on white robes as if they are saints or something, but it turns out that they are worse than earthworms!”

“Hmph! I actually thought that Jiang Yuantai is really that talented, but it looks like he’s just a weakling desperate to prove himself.”

“Pui!”

All kinds of scoldings echoed in the air.

The cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy had already done all they could to beg for mercy in the past few days, but it was to no avail. Since they were going to die anyway, there was no reason for them to mince their words anymore. They hurled all kinds of nasty insults toward Jiang Yuantai and the others.

Jiang Yuantai and those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were displeased to hear that. Murderous intent began blazing from them.

They were only tolerating it so that Jiang Yuantai could prove himself, but if Jiang Yuantai’s loss was already confirmed, they would make sure that those who had humiliated them would pay a terrible price for it.
