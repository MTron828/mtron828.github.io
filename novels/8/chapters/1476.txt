MGA: Chapter 1477 - Ancient Era’s Organism

Hearing those words, the expressions of the eight elders all became extremely ugly. However, they did not dare to speak. Feeling helpless, the remaining seven turned their gazes to Elder Xue.

At this moment, Elder Xue’s mouth twitched slightly. However, in the end, he summoned up his courage and spoke with a humble tone, “My lord, we are ordered by our Lord Assembly Master to protect this place. Now that someone has intruded into the forbidden area, we cannot ignore that...”

“Do not speak anymore. This matter is in my hands. As for you all, you merely need to behave, stay here and pretend that nothing has happened.”

“Remember, if any one of you dares to interfere, I will not easily forgive you,” The purple gaseous flames once again let out an ice-cold and ruthless voice.

“Woosh~~~”

After it left those words , the purple gaseous flames shrank away from the ancient pagoda and disappeared into the distance. As for the direction it headed in, it was towards the Ancient Era’s Remnants.

“What do we do now?” The old lady turned around and looked to the other seven elders.

“Do as he says. Even Lord Assembly Master must take him into consideration. People like us cannot afford to offend him.”

At this moment, that Elder Xue with the fiery temperament had closed his eyes. Although he was unwilling, there was nothing he could do. With his self-esteem receiving a blow, he could only close his eyes to regain his composure.

“Elder Xue, quickly, look at that!” Suddenly, an elder pointed at the golden spirit formation and cried out in alarm.

“You’re an elder of the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly. At the very least, you should be able to keep your composure, no? Why are you making a big fuss? Do you know how disgraceful that is?” Being woken up by the noise, Elder Xue’s expression was extremely ugly. However, he still ended up looking toward the spirit formation.

“Heavens! How is that possible!!!” When he saw the spirit formation, an expression of astonishment appeared on his aged face.

At this moment, the flickering silhouette that used to be on the spirit formation had actually disappeared. It was as if it had never been there to begin with. It was completely and utterly gone from the spirit formation.

However, they all knew very well how powerful this spirit formation was. As long as it was triggered, it would be able to track each and every movement of the person that triggered it and illustrate it on the spirit formation. It was impossible for the person who triggered it to escape from the spirit formation.

Yet, at this moment, the person who had triggered the spirit formation had disappeared. This meant that the person who had triggered it was no ordinary character. At the very least, it would be impossible for a disciple of the Nine Powers to undo this spirit formation.

“He has undone the tracking formation? That is definitely not something that a disciple could accomplish. That person is definitely not a disciple that’s participating in the Nine Powers Hunt. An expert has intruded into the forbidden area. Elder Xue, what should we do?” The elders present all started to panic.

Even though they had experienced a lot of things and managed to become elders of the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly, even though they should be able to remain calm even when facing the rupture of Mount Tai, not panic even when facing the burst of the Yellow River, the matter before them right now was simply too serious; it was impossible for them to not panic, to remain calm and to ignore it.

“All of you, stay here and guard this place. I’ll return to the Sacred Assembly to inform Lord Assembly Master.” As Elder Xue spoke, he stood up.

“But, didn’t that person say that we could not interfere?...” The other seven elders grew worried.

“Is it more serious to offend him or or is it more serious to offend Lord Assembly Master? Don’t tell me that you’re uncertain about this!”

As Elder Xue spoke, he had already flown out. By the time his voice reached the ears of the seven other elders, he was already thousands of miles away.

The faster his speed was, the more it meant that he was feeling extreme unrest...

Inside the Ancient Era’s Remnants. Chu Feng suddenly opened his eyes. He had managed to use his outstanding world spirit techniques to eliminate the tracking formation within him. The people from the Cyanwood Mountain could not detect where he was anymore.

However, Chu Feng was not rejoicing because of this. Instead, he was frowning. He turned his cautious gaze to his surroundings.

Several miles away, in that vast mist, numerous pairs of lantern-like red glows appeared. They were Ancient Era’s Organisms.

“I had already deliberately concealed my aura. However, my scent was still detected by you all. It would seem that I have underestimated you all.”

“Since I cannot escape anymore, allow me to see exactly what sort of ability you Ancient Era’s Organisms possess,” Chu Feng’s gaze turned sharp.

Chu Feng knew beforehand that there were Ancient Era’s Organisms in the surroundings area. However, the location where Chu Feng was at, was not in the range of the Ancient Era’s Organisms’ dwelling. Chu Feng thought that as long as he concealed his aura, they would not be able to discover him, even if he were to stay motionless for a short period of time.

However, it would appear that Chu Feng had been mistaken. These Ancient Era’s Organisms possessed an an extremely keen sense of smell. It was simply even stronger than spirit power. Even though Chu Feng’s ability to conceal his aura was already extremely high, he was unable to escape their detection.

Right now, the only option for Chu Feng was to confront them. Fortunately, although these Ancient Era’s Organisms were not weak, they were only at the level of rank one Half Martial Emperors. This level of strength was something that the current Chu Feng could handle with his world spirit techniques.

“Aouuu~~~”

Suddenly, many low roars began to sound unceasingly. As the roars approached, Chu Feng was finally able to clearly see their appearances.

Over three meters tall and ten meters in length, these Ancient Era’s Organisms were even larger than adult elephants. However, when compared to Monstrous Beasts of the same tier, they were not at all large.

Although their sizes were not very large, their appearances were a bit peculiar. While they looked like wolves, they did not have the slightest bit of fur on their bodies. Instead, they were covered with scales.

Furthermore, there were no eyes nor noses on their heads. There was only a single mouth filled with sharp teeth.

Although they had neither eyes nor noses, this did not mean that they were blind and could not smell. Merely, the locations of their eyes and noses were in different places.

Their eyes were actually on their shoulders; one on each shoulder. In place of their noses were fish-like gills that grew on the sides of their ribs. There were two rows of gills on each side. They were breathing using those gills.

At this time, a total of forty-eight such Ancient Era’s Organisms appeared around Chu Feng, surrounding him completely.

“Everyone, I am only passing by this place. I did not have the intention to offend you all,” Chu Feng did not fight them right away. Instead, he actually cautiously opened his mouth and tried to communicate with them.

“Aouuu~~~” However, at this time, wave upon wave of snarls sounded in succession. The forty-eight Ancient Era’s Organisms all opened their mouths in unison and, while brandishing their blade-like claws, charged to attack Chu Feng.

They had all ignored Chu Feng and decided to directly attack him. Furthermore, they were using the most primitive method of attack.

“Damn it,” At this moment, Chu Feng shouted in his heart.

He discovered that these Ancient Era’s Organisms not only possessed the cultivation of rank one Half Martial Emperors, they also possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. They had hidden their heaven-defying battle power extremely well. Before they started attacking, even Chu Feng did not detect that they possessed this sort of heaven-defying battle power.

In other words, what Chu Feng was facing right now was not merely forty-eight rank one Half Martial Emperor-level Ancient Era’s Organisms. Instead, it was forty-eight rank four Half Martial Emperor-level Ancient Era’s Organisms.

Danger. It was the first time Chu Feng realized how dangerous this Ancient Era’s Remnant was. He never expected the Ancient Era’s Organisms here to be this frightening.

“No matter what, I can only fight with all of my strength,” With danger approaching and no way to escape, Chu Feng had no choice but to go all-out.

“Huuu~~~”

Thus, with a thought from Chu Feng, boundless spirit power began to emit from his body like a whirlwind. With enormous power, it swept toward the forty-eight Ancient Era’s Organisms.

“Bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”

However, at the time when Chu Feng’s world spirit attack was about to reach those forty-eight Ancient Era’s Organisms, their bodies suddenly changed. They became perfectly straight like sharp swords and actually penetrated past Chu Feng’s spirit formations.

“What a thorny problem. Seems like I can only take care of them one at a time,” Seeing that his group attack was useless, Chu Feng flipped his palm and took out the Demon Sealing Sword.

He then covered the Demon Sealing Sword with his spirit power. In an instant, the might of the Demon Sealing Sword doubled.

This was a special method that borrowed the power of a Royal Armament to increase the might of a spirit formation. Chu Feng wasn’t using his Royal Armament as the main attack source, he was still relying on his world spirit techniques.

“Woosh~~~”

Chu Feng raised the Demon Sealing Sword and charged toward the Ancient Era’s Organism closest to him.

Chu Feng’s speed was extremely fast, faster than even lightning. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived before this Ancient Era’s Organism, and the Demon Sealing Sword, strengthened by the spirit formation, was thrust toward that Ancient Era’s Organism’s head.

Chu Feng was able to sense that the Ancient Era’s Organism’s body composition was very extraordinary and that their heads were their greatest weakness.

Although Chu Feng’s attack might appear to be simple, it was actually a fusion of Chu Feng’s movement technique, strength, speed and battle power, as well as many strengthening world spirit techniques.

It could be said that this thrust possessed boundless power, that this single thrust was capable of enormous destruction. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Chu Feng had practically gone all-out in this one thrust. This thrust had to succeed, or Chu Feng would die trying to make it work.

“Puuu~~~”

A muffled sound was heard, and green blood began to spray all over the place. Not only did Chu Feng’s thrust managed to pierce into that Ancient Era’s Organism’s head, he had also managed to completely split that head into pieces, exploding away in the process. Chu Feng had succeed in killing that Ancient Era’s Organism.

“Forty-seven more,” Immediately after Chu Feng landed on the ground, he turned his gaze to his surroundings. He was trying to determine which Ancient Era’s Organism was still charging to attack him, which among them was the closest to him and which among them he could kill with a single strike.

“Aooouuuu~~~”

However, at this moment, the remaining forty-seven Ancient Era’s Organisms did not charge to attack Chu Feng. Instead, they all began to run toward a single direction.

When the forty-seven Ancient Era’s Organisms all gathered in one location, their bodies started to emit a faint green light. Those faint green lights were growing brighter and brighter. In the end, the many faint green lights fused into one enormous monster, over thirty meters tall and a hundred meters long.

Most importantly, the aura being emitted by this enormous monster was no longer that of a rank four Half Martial Emperor. Instead, it was now that of a rank five Half Martial Emperor.

“Fuck, are you kidding me?”

At this moment, even Chu Feng was dumbstruck. He had an expression of disbelief all over his face.
