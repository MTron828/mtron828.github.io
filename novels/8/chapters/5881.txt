Chapter 5882: Chu Xuanyuan and the Three Saints Monstrous Clan

The colossal being sighed. “Chu Xuanyuan made a huge contribution to our clan. Our sacred realm cultivation ground wouldn’t have opened if not for him, and we wouldn’t have enjoyed our current prosperity either. You’re the clan chief, after all. You ought to be more magnanimous. There’s no need to make things hard for Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

“He did make great contributions to our clan, but that doesn’t offset the sins he has committed. Elder Sheng, have you forgotten that he’s the one who set our Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s sacred treasures loose? Those are sacred treasures our ancestors left behind! If not for that, my father wouldn’t have become bedridden. I would rather my father remain as the clan chief than me. His contribution amounts to nothing compared to his sins! Even killing a hundred times over wouldn’t have been too much,” the middle-aged man exclaimed.

Even the surroundings turned cold in response to his emotions.

The colossal being fell silent, and the middle-aged man fell silent too.

A moment later, the middle-aged man finally calmed down and said with an apologetic tone, “Elder Sheng, I didn’t mean to put you down, but I am holding myself back. I’d have killed Chu Xuanyuan’s son as soon as he entered otherwise.

“Taking a step back, even if he wasn’t Chu Xuanyuan’s son but just another intruder, we still have to make him understand that our Three Saints Monstrous Clan is not a place where he can come and go as he pleases. I’ll leave it to you to deal with Chu Xuanyuan’s son.”

The middle-aged man turned around and took his leave.

The colossal being sighed. Its massive physique began to contact until it was only a meter tall, looking like a hunched old man. He didn’t have any eyes, but its ears were as big as two fans.

It first dispelled the sealing formation before flitting to the spirit formation gate where Zi Ling was waiting earlier.

Shortly after, Chu Feng walked out from the spirit formation gate. The first thing that came into his line of sight was the hunched old man, but Zi Ling’s absence was conspicuous to him too.

Thus, he put up his guard.

“Calm down, young friend Chu Feng. Miss Zi Ling is safe,” the old man reassured Chu Feng upon sensing his tension.

“Where is she? Bring me to her,” Chu Feng said.

“All right.” The old man nodded.

He rose into the air and enveloped Chu Feng with a surge of energy before walking off with leisurely steps. His speed far surpassed ordinary True God level cultivators, and that might not even be the full extent of his prowess yet.

“Young friend Chu Feng, aren’t you curious about me and the people whom you met in the cavern?” the old man asked.

“I am, but I want to meet Zi Ling first before chatting,” Chu Feng said.

He was worried because he didn’t trust the old man in front of him. It was one thing for him to get into danger, but the thought of any harm befalling Zi Ling tortured him. He felt self-reproach for leaving Zi Ling behind and entering the spirit formation gate by himself. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Such a thing wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

“Zi Ling is safe. You don’t need to be so guarded against me. I don’t intend to hurt you and your lover. I have watched your father grow up, after all,” the old man said.

“You know my father?” Chu Feng was surprised.

His father had always taken a special place in his heart, but he had rarely seen anyone expressing goodwill to his father before. Yet, this old man treated him with respect and even mentioned his father.

This led Chu Feng to think that there might be some credence behind the other party’s words.

“Mmhm.” The old man nodded.

“Elder, I was trapped earlier and had no choice but to enter the spirit formation gate. There were no instructions, but I was assaulted twice. And when I came out, Zi Ling was nowhere to be seen. It’s hard for me not to be worried when faced with such a situation. I apologize if I have offended you with my attitude earlier,” Chu Feng said.

“I understand. We lacked hospitality too,” the old man replied with a smile.

The old man proceeded to explain this place to Chu Feng.

The old man was Elder Sheng, and he, along with the white-haired and black-haired men Chu Feng fought earlier, was from the Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clan was the ruler of this realm.

They used to not be hostile toward strangers. Anyone who could reach this far was qualified to enter the Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

Chu Feng’s father had been here multiple times. He was just a junior when he first entered this place, and the last time he came was just a few years back.

“Your father is incredibly talented. He left a strong impression on my clansmen even when he was still a junior. His cultivation would grow by leaps and bounds each time he visited, and he often saw through things that our clansmen failed to. He helped our clansmen decipher a formation and obtain treasures that were previously beyond our reach.

“The last time he came here, his cultivation had already reached a level where I can’t see through, and he wanted to help our Three Saints Monstrous Clan decipher the last formation. Not even our clansmen would have been allowed to easily challenge that formation, but out of trust for your father, our old clan chief decided to let him have a go.

“Unfortunately, he failed. The cost of failure went beyond our expectations; we lost the sacred treasures left behind by our ancestors. We know your father meant no malice, but the sacred treasures are too important to our clan. Out of guilt toward our ancestors and the relapse of his old illness, our clan chief became bedridden.

“The old clan chief’s son took over. He’s about a hundred years older than your father, and you can say that he grew up with your father. They often worked together to decipher formations. They appeared rowdy on the surface, but it’s evident that they share deep ties. He supported your father too when he wanted to challenge the last formation.

“He had some misunderstandings about your father after our sacred treasures went missing and the old clan chief became bedridden, but he isn’t a bad person. You don’t need to worry; Miss Zi Ling will be fine.”

It was at this point that Chu Feng realized something, and his relaxed expression tensed up once more. “You’re saying that it’s the incumbent Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief who took Zi Ling away?”

“Yes, it is the incumbent clan chief who took Miss Zi Ling away. He claimed that you should repay your father’s debt, but his intention is just to scare you. Young friend Chu Feng, based on my understanding of the incumbent clan chief, I can guarantee with my life that Miss Zi Ling will be fine,” Elder Sheng said.
