Chapter 4642: The Powerful Yu Sha

“Yuntian, what are you dilly-dallying for? How long are you going to allow this bastard from the Holy Light Galaxy to remain triumphant for?”

The enraged Gongsun Clan’s Clan Chief actually began berating Gongsun Yuntian as well.

Needless to say, he wanted Gongsun Yuntian to quickly defeat Chu Feng so as to wipe off the smug smile from his face.

“A mere world spirit dares to stop me? I’ll let you know just what kind of world spiritist I, Gongsun Yuntian, am!”

Gongsun Yuntian flicked his sleeves, and the spirit power accumulated within his body began gushing forth like a flood. It pushed the black aura back before revolving around Gongsun Yuntian like a formidable tsunami.

“This is bad.”

Upon seeing this sight, Chu Feng’s gleeful face immediately revealed a hint of anxiety.

Even though he still wasn’t able to deal with Martial Exalted level cultivators yet, he had at least seen the prowess of Martial Exalted level cultivators before. At the very least, he could discern the strength of the clashing duo.

Yu Sha’s overwhelming prowess had been mostly sealed, but she was still a very formidable individual. However, Gongsun Yuntian couldn’t be looked down upon either. His fighting prowess was incredible, such that even rank one Martial Exalted level cultivators would have difficulties trying to deal with him.

This was made apparent by how he was able to last so long against Yu Sha.

On top of that, he wasn’t just blindly releasing his spirit power at the moment. He was constructing a powerful formation that would raise his prowess greatly once completed.

Chu Feng couldn’t be certain whether Yu Sha would really be able to deal with Gongsun Yuntian once the latter finished the formation.

“Yu Sha, if the circumstances appear to be against you, retreat right away. Don’t push yourself too hard,” Chu Feng told Yu Sha.

Yu Sha didn’t respond. The black aura receded back into the formation spirit gate, but at the next moment, a beautiful figure stepped out from within.

Needless to say, it was Yu Sha,

She was using her actions to tell Chu Feng that she wouldn’t back down. Even if Gongsun Yuntian were to activate a powerful formation here to enhance his prowess, she was still determined to bring him down.

“Is that Chu Feng’s world spirit? What a beautiful lady she is! As I thought, Chu Feng sure is a perv!” Xia Yan immediately gave her evaluation.

She couldn’t be blamed for thinking that way. Yu Sha was simply too ravishing. Her delicate beauty was contrasted by the valiant air she emanated, making her look not like a naive wallflower but a true war goddess.

“You dare to show your true form despite sensing the changes in my powers? It looks like you’re determined to give your life away to protect your master, huh?” Gongsun Yuntian remarked coldly.

“Give my life away? With what you have shown thus far, the one who is giving his life away is you,” Yu Sha replied coldly.

She began releasing black aura from her body, which morphed into two sharp blades in her hands. Following that, she began charging toward Gongsun Yuntian with those two blades.

Her overwhelming prowess caused the dueling ring to tremor a little each step she took, and the sheer agility of her movements caused the tremor to continue relentlessly as if an earthquake was occurring. Even Chu Feng was unable to properly stay seated on the ground, so he was left with no choice but to levitate himself into the air.

“Hmph!”

On the other hand, Gongsun Yuntian wasn’t backing down at all. He began channeling his spirit power to launch a counterattack.

Just like that, the black aura and spirit power began clashing with one another once more.

Gongsun Yuntian was indeed extremely powerful.

Typically speaking, while rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists were comparable to rank one Martial Exalted level cultivators, in a proper battle, it would still be hard for a world spiritist to deal with a cultivator.

Yet, despite being a world spiritist, Gongsun Yuntian’s strength already far surpassed that of any ordinary rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator.

Xia Yan wasn’t lying when she said that Gongsun Yuntian possessed strength that mustn’t be underestimated. He was indeed worthy of his title as a prodigy.

Nevertheless, right from the start of the match, Gongsun Yuntian had already fallen in a disadvantageous position against Yu Sha.

As the two forces clashed with one another, it was soon made clear that Yu Sha was the one pressing forward whereas Gongsun Yuntian was left to retreat again and again. Even his hands had started trembling too.

In terms of strength, Yu Sha had an absolute advantage.

And that wasn’t just all.

Yu Sha’s speed and techniques were also clearly a notch higher than Gongsun Yuntian’s. It was clear that Gongsun Yuntian was slowly getting cornered as his movements began falling into a fluster. It was apparent that he was having trouble coping.

Soon, fresh blood began splattering from his body as gaping wounds appeared all over him.

On top of that, the intervals in which he was getting injured were growing shorter and shorter, resulting in the accelerating deterioration of his physical condition.

“It looks like I’ve been underestimating this lass,” Chu Feng murmured with a smile as he watched as Gongsun Yuntian was forced to a corner.

He took a look at the Gognsun Clan, and every single one of them looked as if they had been forced to swallow shit. This made him feel even more gleeful.

This was exactly what he was going for.

Chu Feng was not an arrogant person innately, but toward those who carried enmity toward him and sought to claim his life, he wouldn’t hesitate to use whatever it would take to crush them.

Had the Gongsun Clan treated him amicably right from the start, even if they were to cross hands later on, Chu Feng would have still shown them respect and avoided harming their offspring.

It was just a pity that the Gongsun Clan chose to do otherwise, and that was what placed them in the humiliating position they were currently. They were reaping what they sowed.

Yu Sha and Gongsun Yuntian continued clashing with one another.

Yu Sha had an expressionless look on her face, but that only accentuated her impression as a cold beauty. Her merciless attacks against her enemy made her worthy of being labeled a true warrior.

On the other hand, Gongsun Yuntian looked utterly repressed. His wounds kept accumulating, such that his blood had already soaked through his world spiritist robe.

All of a sudden, two surges of black aura suddenly pierced through Gongsun Yuntian’s defense, and two dull thuds sounded.

The swords in Yu Sha’s hands pierced right into Gongsun Yuntian’s left thigh and right thigh.

“Gahhh!”

Gongsun Yuntian released a piercing scream of agony.

This was a deep cut, slicing through not just his flesh but his tendons as well. On top of that, the injuries sustained weren’t just physical but on his soul as well.

As a result, after crying loudly in agony for a while, Gongsun Yuntian crumbled to the floor, losing his will to fight.

This scene had the crowd on the spectator stand shaking their heads.

They never thought that Gongsun Yuntian, whom they carried great expectations for, would actually not be a match for Chu Feng. Disappointment could be seen on each and every one of their faces.

“Hahahahaha! Interesting! Truly interesting!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Unexpectedly, just as everyone thought that the victor had been decided, Gongsun Yuntian suddenly began laughing frenziedly.

His laughter sounded incredibly eerie. Despite having lost the battle, his tone was arrogant.

“What are you laughing at?”

Standing not too far away from Gongsun Yuntian with two black swords in her grasp, Yu Sha asked coldly.

She didn’t continue her offense, but she didn’t put down her guard either. If Gongsun Yuntian were to show any signs of attacking, she would unhesitatingly deal a fatal blow on him.

“Since you have chosen to fight for your master, you should have the resolve to lose your life. Remember, you are the one who courted your own death,” Gongsun Yuntian sneered coldly at Yu Sha.

There was an incredibly belligerent look in his eyes.

Weng!

At the next moment, a spirit formation gate suddenly appeared between Yu Sha and Gongsun Yuntian. Black aura poured out of the spirit formation gate.

Yu Sha, who was standing right before the spirit formation gate, was caught off guard by the sudden outpour of black aura and ended up getting struck squarely by it.

What was even more astonishing was that she was actually knocked back by it, flying for a long distance before finally screeching to a halt.
