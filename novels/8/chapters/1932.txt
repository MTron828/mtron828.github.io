Chapter 1932 - Nefarious Sword

“I have said that you will become an enormous threat to our Dark Hall should you continue to live. However, I’ll tell you this: although you might be the greatest threat, you are no match for the Dark Hall. You wish to know who the master of the Dark Hall is? I’d urge you that it’s best you never know, for the day you know who it is shall be the day of your death. Hahahahaha!!!”

After he finished saying those words, the YinYang Immortal burst into frantic and extremely abnormal laughter.

“Puchi~~~”

At that moment, Chu Feng pierced his Evil God Sword into the YinYang Immortal’s dantian.

“You!!!” Being pierced by Chu Feng’s sword out of nowhere, not only did the YinYang Immortal stop laughing, he also looked at Chu Feng with amazement. He had not expected Chu Feng to act this soon.

“I know that you wish to kill yourself. However, your life and death is not something for you to decide. Even if you are to die, you will die by my hands,” As Chu Feng spoke, the Evil God Sword in his hand started to tremble. Then, a burst of boundless oppressive might entered the YinYang Immortal’s body and shattered all his internal organs.

Even though the YinYang Immortal’s corpse appeared to be undamaged on the surface, he was actually utterly dead.

“Eggy, what do you think about the taste of this rank six Martial Emperor?” Chu Feng asked Eggy.

The reason why Chu Feng needed to personally kill the YinYang Immortal was all for Eggy’s sake.

All those killed by Chu Feng would have their source energies absorbed by Eggy before their deaths.

However, when facing those that killed themselves through self denotation, and not by his hand, like those ten Dark Hall’s experts Chu Feng had captured before, he was unable to have Eggy absorb their source energies before their deaths.

If the YinYang Immortal were to self-detonate, Chu Feng would not be able to have Eggy absorb his source energy.

As the YinYang Immortal’s source energy was that of a rank six Martial Emperor, how could he possibly afford to waste it? Thus, he had to personally kill the YinYang Immortal so that Eggy could absorb his source energy.

“A rank six Martial Emperor’s source energy is pretty good. Unfortunately, this Queen’s cultivation still didn’t manage to make any huge progress,” Eggy said with her lips curled.

“There’s actually still no progress?” Chu Feng was also startled to hear those words. Ever since Eggy woke back up, Chu Feng had killed many experts. Among them were many Martial Emperors.

All those killed by Chu Feng, regardless of whether he left them an intact corpse or not, would have their source energies absorbed and refined by Eggy before their deaths.

However, even though Eggy had refined the source energies of that many Martial Emperor-level experts, her cultivation had still made no progress.

Before, Chu Feng had thought the entire time that the amount of source energy that Eggy needed was enormous. The reason for that was because Eggy was like him. The quantity of source energy she needed in order to reach a breakthrough in cultivation was extremely enormous.

However, Chu Feng felt that the YinYang Immortal’s rank six Martial Emperor’s source energy should be helpful toward Eggy’s cultivation. After all, she had already refined the source energies of so many experts. Even if she didn’t manage to make a breakthrough, they should have left her a good foundation to make a breakthrough with. Thus, with the addition of the YinYang Immortal’s source energy, she should have reached a breakthrough by now. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yet, it was actually useless. This meant that it was not an issue of there not being enough source energy. Instead, it was some other problem.

“It seems that it’s useless. The seal your mother placed on me is truly too strong. I reckon it’s that seal that has restricted my cultivation. I feel that my own body is not the reason why I need more source energy than others. Rather, it must be that seal. It is that spirit formation that sealed me that takes the greater amount of the source energies,” Eggy said helplessly.

“How could it be like this?” Chu Feng also felt extremely shocked. He had never suspected that the seal on Eggy was capable of engulfing source energies.

“I reckon that it’s because your mother is distrusting of me. That’s why she deliberately used that spirit formation seal to limit my growth,” Eggy smiled sweetly. WIth a very indifferent expression, she added, “However, it doesn’t matter anymore. The speed at which you grow is extremely fast. Even if my cultivation is to progress somewhat, I will still not be able to provide with you anymore assistance.”

“You already no longer need the protection of this Queen. From today onward, you shall be the one to protect this Queen,” Eggy smiled very sweetly. It was so sweet that one would feel as if their heart would melt just by looking at her smile.

However, Chu Feng’s heart was feeling extremely sour. Even though his mother had sealed Eggy for the sake of protecting him, he felt as if he had let Eggy down enormously.

‘Eggy, rest assured. Sooner or later, I will remove that seal from you. I am already preparing for it. I’ll definitely succeed.’

Chu Feng said those words from the bottom of his heart. He did not speak them out loud. The reason for that was because the seal on Eggy was truly too powerful. After all, it was his mother’s technique. Chu Feng simply did not know what level of world spiritist his mother was.

Thus, Chu Feng did not have too great of a certainty that he would be able to undo Eggy’s seal. Even though he was already making preparations to do so, he knew that it would be a very long process to actually undo Eggy’s seal.

At the very least, the materials that he had gathered so far were greatly insufficient. He still needed to gather many, many more materials.

Xian Miaomiao gathered all of the possessions from the YinYang Immortal’s corpse. Then, she walked up to Chu Feng and asked, “Chu Feng, why did you leave him an intact corpse? That man’s death is well-justified. He should be dismembered into ten thousand pieces.”

“If you are unable to do it yourself, this princess can help you hack him up.”

“I am going to use his death to warn the people of the Dark Hall,” Chu Feng said.

“So that’s the case. I understand now,” Xian Miaomiao was very intelligent. She already understood Chu Feng’s intentions. Then, she opened her hand and handed several Cosmos Sacks to Chu Feng, “Here, they’re all from the YinYang Immortal. It must be said that that fellow truly obtained a lot of treasures. As you’re a world spiritist, these things are useful to you.”

“It is all thanks to you that I was able to kill him. I would be embarrassed to accept all of them. How about this? Let’s share them fifty-fifty,” Chu Feng did not take the Cosmos Sacks.

“Fifty-fifty? Fifty-fifty your head.”

“The majority of the things here are treasures for world spiritists. What use do I have for them? Furthermore, no matter what, I am still the Elf Kingdom’s little princess. Did you think I would lack those things?”

“What I lack the most are the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers. However, with your assistance, I have already found them. With these here that I’ll be bringing back to refine, I might even be able to reach another breakthrough. It would not be unrealistic for me to become a rank six Martial Emperor,” Xian Miaomiao slapped at the pink Cosmos Sack on her waist with a beaming smile. The only things contained in that Cosmos Sack were Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll accept them then,” Chu Feng accepted the Cosmos Sacks and put them away. The YinYang Immortal possessed even more treasures than the Avaricious Immortal. They were truly very useful to Chu Feng.

“However, on a different subject, while the things for world spiritists might be useless for you, this should be useful, right?” As Chu Feng spoke, he picked up that Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade. He planned to hand the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade to Xian Miaomiao.

“No, no, no. I possess my own Imperial Armament, whereas you do not.”

“The YinYang Immortal is now dead. As such, this Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade is a masterless weapon. It would be perfect for you to use it,” Xian Miaomiao refused. In order to prevent Chu Feng from handing the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade to her, she pushed Chu Feng away with a soft martial power and prevented him from getting close to her.

Being pushed back by Xian Miaomiao’s martial power, the Evil God Sword in Chu Feng’s right hand happened to come into contact with the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade in his left hand.

“Buzz~~~”

The moment the Evil God Sword came into contact with the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade, an enormous suction power originated from within the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade.

That suction power was truly frightening. It was as if it was trying to suck away Chu Feng’s soul. In panic, Chu Feng hurriedly released the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade in his left hand.

“Chu Feng, that sword, that sword!!!”

In the instant Chu Feng let go of the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade, Xian Miaomiao began to shout at him in astonishment. She was so shocked that she was unable to speak clearly.

Upon looking at it, Chu Feng was also extremely shocked. As an Imperial Armament, the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade should be indestructible. Yet, at that moment, it was dissolving into muddy water and being assimilated into the Evil God Sword.

It turned out that the frightening suction power was not actually being emitted by the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade itself. Rather, it was caused by the Evil God Sword. The Evil God Sword was currently devouring the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade.

Furthermore, the speed at which the Evil God Sword devoured the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade was extremely fast. In merely a short moment, the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade was completely devoured by the Evil God Sword.

The Evil God Sword’s appearance remained completely unchanged. As for the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade, it had completely disappeared. It had been refined by the Evil God Sword.
