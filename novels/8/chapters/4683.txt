Chapter 4683: She Cares For You Much More Than You Care For Her

“Return to your body right now, and I’ll tell you what happened,” Eggy said.

However, Chu Feng didn’t get up right away. He was still hesitant to leave Eggy be.

“Hurry up and go back! Don’t make this Queen angry, alright?” Eggy bared her teeth at Chu Feng as she roared angrily.

She even raised her small hands to push Chu Feng out, but she was simply too weak that she was unable to move him at all. On the contrary, it only worsened her condition.

This made Chu Feng’s heart even heavier.

“Alright alright, don’t get angry. I’ll head back right now, but you must tell me what happened afterward. Yu Sha, I’ll be counting on you to take care of Eggy.”

Chu Feng was worried about Eggy, but he knew that he wasn’t able to do anything to help at the moment. So, he returned back to his body and continued channeled his bloodline power to hasten the speed of descent.

This time around, however, he couldn’t maintain his full attention. He was simply too worried about Eggy that he ended up getting distracted. He focused a part of his attention on channeling his bloodline power and the other part to keep an eye on the World Spirit Space.

“Eggy, what happened? Did you suffer a backlash because you were unable to fully assimilate the Asura God-Demon Stone?” Chu Feng asked.

After giving it some thought, he felt that this was the most likely possibility.

“Yes. I have to fully assimilate it, or else the backlash will grow more and more severe. However, it isn’t a huge problem at the moment. The side effects aren’t that severe yet. It’ll be fine as long as I continue my cultivation. This time, it shouldn’t take that long.

“So, you don’t have to worry about me. You have to keep your temper in check after entering the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Remember, your priority is to save Zi Ling. Even though I’m going to go into closed-door training, you should remember that I can see what’s going on.

“I know that you value your friends and family, and I can relate to that too. However, your safety should always come first. You haven’t saved your mother and found your grandfather yet. You can’t afford to die yet. So, you better act prudently and don’t keep putting yourself in danger’s way. Otherwise, I’ll make sure to settle the scores with you once I return!”

The anger in Eggy’s voice had vanished. She was so feeble that even speaking was a chore to her, and yet, she still tried her best to appear strong and put on a smile.

“Eggy, are you going to go into closed-door training right now to continue assimilating the Asura God-Demon Stone?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes. If I don’t hurry up, there’ll really be great trouble,” Eggy replied.

“Go on and do what you need to do. There’s no need to worry about me. I can settle my matters here myself. Make sure that you fully assimilate the Asura God-Demon Stone this time around before coming back, alright? I’ll also grow stronger in the meantime, and we shall reunite in our best conditions,” Chu Feng said.

“Sounds good. Alright, I’ll be heading off now.”

Eggy was still smiling, but her condition was definitely not as simple as she put it out to be. Even when sitting cross-legged, she needed to lean on Yu Sha in order to remain upright.

“Little sister Yu Sha, Chu Feng is an obstinate person. I know that you are a reticent person, but you should still berate him whenever he goes overboard. You can’t allow him to do as he pleases. Also, even though he had been through many difficulties, he’s ultimately still a guy. You must take care of him well. That’s the responsibility we, as world spirits, bear,” Eggy instructed Yu Sha.

“Miss Queen, rest assured...” Yu Sha said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Alright, stop calling me Miss Queen. It sounds terribly awkward. Since you aren’t willing to call me ‘big sister’, you can just address me the same way Chu Feng does. Just call me Eggy. That sounds much more intimate...” Eggy said.

“Eggy...” Yu Sha hesitated for a moment before adding. “Big sister Eggy.”

“What a good girl you are. Alright, I’ll be leaving Chu Feng to you then!”

Seeing that Yu Sha had finally chosen to call her ‘big sister’, Eggy responded with a satisfied smile. Then, she closed her eyes and began cultivating.

However, despite having gone into cultivation, a huge amount of blood was still seeping from the edges of her mouth, and her complexion was terrifyingly pale. It looked as if she was about to lose her life.

“Yu Sha, what’s going on?”

While channeling his bloodline power, Chu Feng had been keeping an eye out for Eggy’s condition, and he was worried to see that her condition wasn’t improving at all. So, he quickly brought his consciousness back into the World Spirit Space.

He could tell that Eggy was indeed in closed-door training, but why was her condition worsening despite so?

Chu Feng couldn’t understand what was going on at all.

“Her condition was indeed caused by the backlash of the Asura God-Demon Stone, but the effects of the backlash aren’t as straightforward as she put it out to be. The Asura God-Demon Stone is incredibly rare and precious in the Asura Spirit World, but at the same time, it’s a feared existence as well. It’s a cultivation resource that few could hope to ever control.

“To put it in simpler terms, forcefully retreating from her closed-door training while being in the midst of assimilating the Asura God-Demon Stone was no different from an act of suicide. It was a miracle that she was able to succeed without losing her life right away. On top of that, she didn’t return back to assimilating the Asura God-Demon Stone right away afterward either,” Yu Sha told Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt as if his heart had been stabbed by a knife. It was much more unbearable than any physical pain he had suffered before.

He was no fool, so how could he not understand Yu Sha’s words?

There was no way Eggy couldn’t have known the consequences of forcefully halting the assimilation of the Asura God-Demon Stone. She had no choice but to do it in order to save him from the dire situation he was in back then.

“I did talk to her about this before, but she wouldn’t listen to me. She told me not to tell you about how dangerous her condition is. Even though she looks fine on the surface, she was just bearing the pain of the backlash behind her smile.

“Had it been not for that, she should have been much powerful than how she is at the moment. The strength she exerted to stop the lava earlier is her true power, but the exertion of her true power ended up worsening the backlash, resulting in the swift deterioration of her condition. If it wasn’t for that, I reckon that she would have chosen to remain here instead of rushing back into her cultivation.

“Also, even though she has stopped her assimilation, the Asura God-Demon Stone still continues to release its energy. This energy wouldn’t go to her; it would only go to waste.”

Yu Sha was finally able to say those words that she had been bottling up in her heart. However, she couldn’t have known that every sentence she spoke was like a sharp knife plunging into Chu Feng’s heart.

His body trembled in agitation, and he felt a sour sensation in his nose. He finally understood just how big of a price Eggy was paying to retreat from her closed-door training.

“She’s willing to abandon her strength and health in order to protect you. All this while, I couldn’t understand why you would care so much about a single world spirit, but I can see it now. In truth, she cares for you much more than you care for her...” Yu Sha said.
