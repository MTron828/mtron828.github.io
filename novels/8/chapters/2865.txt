Chapter 2865 - Chu Feng’s Reward

"Inheritance Cave? Judging by its name, it seems to be an extraordinary treasure deposit," Chu Feng said.

"That’s right. That was also what our Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Ruler and the Nine Profound Sect’s Utmost Exalted Elder thought."

"It is common knowledge that there are countless remnants in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. However, if the information of the remnants’ location is to be spread out and reach the Chu Heavenly Clan’s ears, then a remnant like that one would become the Chu Heavenly Clan’s possession."

"Truth be told, our Holy Ruler back then possessed selfish desires. Naturally, he would want to obtain the treasures inside the Inheritance Cave."

"Because of that, our last Holy Ruler and that Nine Profound Sect’s Utmost Exalted Elder decided to stay and guard the entrance of the Inheritance Cave all year round. They tried all sorts of methods to break through the entrance. However, in the end, the two of them did not succeed."

"In fact, later on, the Nine Profound Sect’s Utmost Exalted Elder even returned to their Nine Profound Sect to request the assistance of their sectmaster. However, not even the Nine Profound Sect’s Sectmaster was able to open the entrance to the Inheritance Cave. One must know that the Nine Profound Sect is the overlord of the Nine Profound Upper Realm. As for the Nine Profound Sect’s Sectmaster, he was an Exalted-level expert," Xia Yun’er said.

"In that case, it would mean that the Inheritance Cave is likely something left behind by an Ancient Era’s expert. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be that difficult to breach," Chu Feng said.

"No, that’s not the case. Although that Inheritance Cave and the remnants in the Flat Mount Ravine are quite old, they are definitely not as old as to be from the Ancient Era. Judging by the time when our last Holy Ruler discovered it, it should only be around eighty thousand years old," Xia Yun’er said.

"That young? Exactly what sort of expert left it behind then? Did you all manage to deduce that?" Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng actually had a guess in his heart. The person Chu Feng was guessing was Exalted Archer.

The reason why Chu Feng asked this sort of question was precisely because he felt that it was most likely left behind by Exalted Archer.

However, the Nine Profound Sect’s Sectmaster was also an Exalted-level expert. Even he was unable to breach that Inheritance Cave.

If that Inheritance Cave was really left behind by Exalted Archer, then it would appear that the Exalted Archer was even more powerful than Chu Feng had imagined.

"We were unable to conclude anything. However, in the end, that Inheritance Cave still opened," Xia Yun’er said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

"How did it open?" Chu Feng asked.

"It opened by itself," Xia Yun’er said.

"By itself?" Chu Feng was surprised.

"Indeed, it opened by itself. However, even though it opened, our Holy Ruler, as well as the other experts present, were all unable to enter it. Later on, it was discovered that only people of the younger generation were able to enter it," Xia Yun’er said.

"Only people of the younger generation were able to enter it?" Chu Feng was surprised once again.

"That’s right. Not only that, but those people of the younger generation must at least be Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Otherwise, they would not be able to enter it."

"Furthermore, the amount of people that can enter it is limited. Every time it opens, only ten people can enter," Xia Yun’er said.

"In that case, did you all manage to obtain any harvest from it?" Chu Feng asked.

"We have. Our Starfall Holy Land and the Nine Profound Sect each selected five members of the younger generation to enter that Inheritance Cave."

"Inside, it was discovered that one would not necessarily be able to obtain the inheritance should one enter the Inheritance Cave. If one wanted to obtain benefits, one must decipher things. Furthermore, the subject each time would be different. The only thing that was certain was that all of the subjects were related to world spiritists."

"As for that Inheritance Cave, it will open once every one hundred years."

"All these years, our Starfall Holy Land and the Nine Profound Sect have each dispatched five members of the younger generation to the Inheritance Cave whenever it is time for it to open."

"Furthermore, there is an agreement between our Starfall Holy Land and the Nine Profound Sect. That is, whichever side manages to unlock an inheritance site will gain control over it," Xia Yun’er said.

"Could this be the reason why you’ve asked for my assistance?" Chu Feng asked.

"I want to ask that you enter together with me. If you are able to unlock an inheritance site, I want you to share it with us," Xia Yun’er said.

"But, I am not a disciple of the Starfall Holy Land. It would not be proper for me to participate in this, no?" Chu Feng said with a frown.

The first thing that came to Chu Feng’s mind was that Xia Yun’er might ask for him to join the Starfall Holy Land so that he could help her.

However, Chu Feng had already made his resolution that he would not join any power. This was a matter of principle. He would not join the Starfall Holy Land for the sake of some benefit.

"For the last hundred years, neither our Starfall Holy Land nor the Nine Profound Sect have had been able to raise that many Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist-level younger generations. Because of that, we came to an agreement last year that we could seek help."

"As for this year, our Starfall Holy Land does not possess five people of the younger generation that are Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Thus, there is definitely no problem for me to seek your help. After all, the Nine Profound Sect will have most definitely sought external help too," Xia Yun’er said.

"Although you’re said to be allies, you’re still contending with one another. Perhaps something like this is nothing serious for you all. But, should I, an outsider, involve myself in this, I’d end up offending people."

"If the Nine Profound Sect is to think ill of me, they might end up attacking me in the shadows. Should that happen, it would truly not be worthwhile," Chu Feng said.

"The Nine Profound Sect will definitely not dare to touch you inside the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm," Xia Yun’er said.

"In other words, once I leave the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Nine Profound Sect will definitely not spare me," Chu Feng said.

"I won’t deny it. That is indeed the case. You are an intelligent person, I will not deceive you."

"That said, Chu Feng, this is also a rare opportunity for you. Do you really not plan to enter the Inheritance Cave?"

"The world of martial cultivators is one where opportunities and dangers exist together. If one is afraid of danger, one will find it very difficult to progress."

"That said, Chu Feng, you do not resemble someone who’s afraid of dangers," Xia Yun’er said.

"Whether or not I’m afraid is one thing. Whether or not I will help is another thing," Chu Feng said.

What Chu Feng was implying was that he would not fear any danger should it be his own business. However, the decision at hand was to help Xia Yun’er. Should he do that, the one who would benefit the most would be the Starfall Holy Land. As such, he would have to properly consider whether or not to take on the danger.

At this moment, Elder Xingyi, who had been quiet the entire time until now, finally spoke.

"Little friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. Our Starfall Holy Land will definitely not request your assistance for free."

"Upon entering the Inheritance Cave, as long as we are able to open a site of inheritance, you will be able to enjoy the inheritance together with the people from our Starfall Holy Land."

"Furthermore, that is only part of it. Here is the reward that our Holy Daughter has prepared for you."
