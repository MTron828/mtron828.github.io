Chapter 3296 - Liangqiu Chengfeng

The journey to the Wuma Heavenly Clan was completely silent.

At that moment, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had arrived at the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

Chu Feng was actually feeling nervous. After all, he had left grudges with the strongest genius of the Wuma Heavenly Clan, Wuma Shengjie, in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Although he didn’t do it on purpose, Chu Feng knew how important a woman’s naked body was. To many people, their naked body was even more important than their life.

This was especially true for a genius like Wuma Shengjie. She was simply someone akin to a saintess, and considered herself unexcelled in the entire world, untainted by anyone and anything. Someone like her would concern herself with her naked body even more.

However, her enormously important naked body was actually seen by Chu Feng.

That was simply akin to having something that she considered to be a priceless treasure snatched away by Chu Feng.

Although he did not do it on purpose, it remained that he had seen her body. As such, Chu Feng felt that he was in the wrong.

However, for the sake of Su Rou and Su Mei, he did not seem to currently have the heart to concern himself with all that. He could only brace himself and enter the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s territory.

As the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was someone of the same caliber as the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he had been to the Wuma Heavenly Clan multiple times. As such, many people in the Wuma Heavenly Clan recognized him.

For someone of his status to arrive at the Wuma Heavenly Clan, he would naturally receive the treatment of a distinguished guest.

That said, after Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief were invited into the Wuma Heavenly Clan, the person who came out to receive them was actually a Supreme Elder. As for the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he did not appear to welcome the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Your clan’s clan chief is not in the clan? Where did he go off to?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked with concern. He had just learned from the Supreme Elder that the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was not present in the Wuma Heavenly Clan.

“Eh....” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder seemed to have a hard time answering the question.

Soon, he smiled a relieved smile and said, “Brother Chu and our clan’s clan chief are friends of many years. We are also old acquaintances. As such, there should be no harm in me mentioning this matter to you.”

After that Supreme Elder finished saying those words, he prepared to tell the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief the whereabouts of their clan chief. However, before he could begin, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief interrupted, “However, your clan’s territory is being breached by two mysterious women?”

“Brother Chu, where did you learn about that matter?” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder asked.

“That should be something known by everyone in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm, no?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Hearing those words, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder smiled.

“Indeed, that’s no longer a secret anymore. Actually, our clan has never thought about keeping the matter confidential either.”

“As such, that is not what I planned to tell you,” that Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said.

“Oh? There’s another reason as to why your clan chief is not present in the clan?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Feng’s expressions both changed. A curious look appeared in their eyes.

The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder began to tell Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief what had happened.

After hearing him out, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief came to find out that it was actually also something that had occurred in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.

Not long ago, the Wuma Heavenly Clan had discovered an Ancient Era’s remnant in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.

They did not know who set up that remnant. However, it was filled with layer upon layer of spirit formations.

With such strong spirit formations guarding them, the Wuma Heavenly Clan determined that there were definitely treasures inside.

Furthermore, they deduced that the treasures should be very precious.

For the sake of opening that remnant, the Wuma Heavenly Clan had put forth great effort, and spared no wealth to request the assistance of Grandmaster Liangqiu’s eldest disciple, Liangqiu Chengfeng.

“You all managed to request the assistance of Liangqiu Chengfeng?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked upon hearing Liangqiu Chengfeng’s name.

The reason why he asked that was because Liangqiu Chengfeng was a renowned world spiritist across the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Grandmaster Liangqiu was the number one world spiritist in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. As the eldest disciple of Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Chengfeng was over seven thousand years old now. As for his world spirit techniques, they were of the consummate level. He was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.

Although Liangqiu Chengfeng was a person with a modest and approaching temperament, unlike his eccentric master, who was difficult to get in touch with, it was still not an easy task to request his assistance.

It was not a task that could be settled with only wealth.

“Yes, we’ve requested his help,” that Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said.

“To actually be able to request Liangqiu Chengfeng’s assistance. In that case, it would mean that that Ancient Era’s remnant is definitely no ordinary remnant,” a zealous interest emerged in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s eyes.

He had heard that in order to request Liangqiu Chengfeng’s assistance, there must be a spirit formation that would interest him. For that Ancient Era’s remnant to possess a defensive spirit formation that interested Liangqiu Chengfeng, it would mean that it was most definitely not an ordinary remnant.

“Brother Chu, you’re very correct. That remnant is indeed no small matter. If everything goes as expected, there should be treasures in there that have never before appeared in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“That is the reason why we were keeping this matter confidential. Else, should this matter be known to others and draw forth those major powers, it will turn the situation very bad for us.”

“As such, Brother Chu, we will have to trouble you with keeping this matter confidential too,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said.

“Rest assured, we will definitely not spread word of this matter,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief guaranteed. Then, he asked, “In that case, it would mean that your clan’s clan chief is currently over at that remnant?”

“That’s correct. Had it not been for the fact that our clan chief was busying himself in opening that remnant, those two lasses wouldn’t possibly be able to continue to act so arrogantly for so long,” the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder said.

“I was wondering why your clan’s clan chief would allow those two girls to behave so atrociously in your territory for so long. It turns out that he doesn’t have time to take care of them.”

“However, as information regarding those two girls has spread throughout the entire Scarlet Province Upper Realm, making them the focus of the entire Scarlet Province Upper Realm, if you all are to continue to allow them to go on with their behavior, it will likely affect your Wuma Heavenly Clan’s reputation,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“That’s correct. However, those two girls are extraordinary characters. They are very powerful. Our clan already had a Supreme Elder that was injured by the two of them.”

“According to that Supreme Elder, apart from our clan’s clan chief, there will likely be no one in our clan that will be able to stop those two girls,” at this moment, that Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder revealed a worried look.

“I am a close friend of your clan chief. If your clan does not mind, I am willing to help you catch those two girls,” the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Brother Chu, are you serious?” Hearing those words, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder revealed a joyous look.

Evidently, to him, those two girls were a major headache.

They urgently needed someone to take care of them.
