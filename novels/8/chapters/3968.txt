Chapter 3968 - You’re Nothing More Than Trash

“Never would I had imagined that Nangong Yifan to suddenly become so powerful.”

“I heard that, not long ago, in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, a place filled with trash, there was a person of the younger generation that managed to take him on.”

“However, he has now actually defeated Shentu Haoli. The speed of his growth is simply too fast.”

“Take on? I think you’re mistaken. I’ve heard that person of the younger generation defeated Nangong Yifan.”

“You said that a person of the younger generation from the Ancestral Martial Starfield managed to defeat Nangong Yifan?”

“That shouldn’t be possible, no? How could such a trashy place like the Ancestral Martial Starfield have a person of the younger generation capable of defeating Nangong Yifan?”

“I’m telling the truth. That’s something that was personally witnessed by others. It’s most definitely not a rumor.”

“That matter is absolutely true. I also heard about it. Furthermore, I know that that person of the younger generation is the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Linghu Hongfei.”

“You’re talking about that Linghu Hongfei? I heard he’s already dead.”

“What? Dead?”

“Right. He was killed by another younger generation of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Furthermore, that person of the younger generation came from a very weak clan. I think it’s called Chu Heavenly Clan or something like that.”

“Furthermore, I heard that that person of the younger generation is thought very highly of by others. Because of that, that weak clan became the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s new overlord.”

“You’re kidding. A person of the younger generation was able to lead his clan to become a starfield’s overlord? What sort of existence would that be?”

“I’m telling you the truth. It happened just recently. Soon, news of the matter will spread. At that time, you will all know that I told the truth.”

“In that case, wouldn’t that mean that an extraordinary fellow has appeared in the Ancestral Martial Starfield?”

The disciples from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain were all discussing things spiritedly.

Their source of news was rather fast and abundant. There were actually people among them that had heard what had happened in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, and even knew about Chu Feng.

Unsurprisingly, after that person of the younger generation mentioned Chu Feng, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s younger generations all felt great disbelief.

“For that person of the younger generation to be that powerful, what’s his name?”

“Right, right, right. Tell us.”

Many disciples from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain became very curious.

They urgently wanted to know the name of that Ancestral Martial Starfield’s genius.

“He seems to be called Chu Feng,” said that disciple.

“Chu Feng?”

“According to you, that Linghu Hongfei was stronger than Nangong Yifan.”

“As for that Chu Feng, he’s stronger than Linghu Hongfei.”

“Yet, Nangong Yifan is now the strongest disciple among our six great powers.”

“Wouldn’t that mean that the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Chu Feng fellow is far stronger than us?”

“Nonsense! You must be spouting rumors. Right, that must be it. It’s nothing more than a rumor.”

“I refuse to believe that a person of the younger generation would be so capable as to lead a weak clan to become the overlord of a starfield.”

Soon, many disciples began to reject such a thought.

The reason for their reaction was due to their innermost arrogance.

To them, the Ancestral Martial Starfield was simply trash.

A place like that couldn’t possibly produce anyone powerful.

Furthermore, according to that disciple, a person of the younger generation far superior to them had appeared in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. It was only natural that they would refuse to believe it.

Suddenly, a handsome disciple of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain said, “Enough, enough. Let us not discuss those insignificant matters.”

“We’ve not come here to chat and gossip.”

“Let’s breach this spirit formation and retrieve the treasure inside first.”

“Else, once senior brother Song finishes handling Ouyang Pingzhi and finds out that we still haven’t retrieved the treasure, he’ll definitely become displeased.”

The man that spoke not only had a handsome look, but his cultivation was also very powerful. He was a rank two Exalted.

The man’s name was Zhao Zicheng. Among the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s disciples, he was inferior to only Song Jinglun. Because of that, his words held great weight.

Hearing his words, the disciples of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain immediately began walking towards the bottom of the purple pillar of light. They wanted to quickly breach the spirit formation and retrieve the treasure inside.

“......”

However, all of a sudden, they were stunned.

They discovered that, at the moment when all the disciples of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect had given up, a female disciple actually stood up and blocked their path to the purple pillar.

Her gaze was filled with unswerving determination. It seemed like she would not allow them to retrieve the treasure.

As for that person, she was Bai Lulu.

“Girl, what are you doing?” asked a disciple from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain.

Bai Lulu did not respond. However, she pointed her Wind Lightning Sword towards the disciples of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain.

“Oh-ho. It would appear that you’re unconvinced?”

“Move aside. Don’t think that we won’t do anything to you just because you’re a woman.”

Faced with the determined Bai Lulu, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s disciples all revealed looks of contempt and anger.

However, no matter how she was threatened by them, Bai Lulu’s expression remained unchanged. She showed no sign of cowering to them.

“Junior sister Bai, this is no time to show off.”

Many disciples of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect also began to urge Bai Lulu to move aside.

No one wanted her to make a needless sacrifice.

However, Bai Lulu reacted as if she did not hear them.

There was no trace of fear in her gaze.

Seeing that, the crowd realized that she had made a firm resolution.

“Truly one that refuses face that is given. Scram aside!”

Right at that moment, a female disciple of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain unleashed her attack.

She waved her sleeve, and boundless oppressive might swept towards Bai Lulu.

The woman who had unleashed her oppressive might actually possessed the same cultivation as Zhao Zicheng. She too was a rank two Exalted.

Bai Lulu, with her cultivation, simply could not withstand a rank two Exalted.

“Bang~~~”

However, at the moment when the crowd all felt that Bai Lulu was doomed, an explosion was suddenly heard.

In the next instant, everyone was stunned.

Not only was Bai Lulu still standing there unharmed, but a person had appeared before her.

At the same time, a voice was heard.

“For such a large group of people to bully a girl, do you not find it to be too excessive?”

Those words were spoken by the person before Bai Lulu.

Seeing the person that had appeared before Bai Lulu, the expressions of the crowd all changed greatly.

Even Bai Lulu herself was stunned.

The reason for that was because that person was someone they all knew.

He was none other than Wang Chen, who had contradicted Ouyang Pingzhi and Song Jinglun, only to flee after entering the spirit formation world.

Of course, that Wang Chen was actually Chu Feng.

“It’s actually you?”

“You have some skills. You’re actually able to block my oppressive might?” said the female Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain disciple.

‘Wait, how could Wang Chen possibly block that person’s oppressive might?’

‘That oppressive might is that of a rank two Exalted.’

It was not only the disciples from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain that were surprised; the disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect were even more astonished than them.

After all, in their memories, Wang Chen was only a mere Martial Immortal.

Among their hundred disciples, he was one of the weakest. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Facing the crowd’s shock-filled gazes, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged.

He said to that female disciple, “Is there a need for you to be amazed by me being able to block your oppressive might?”

“Truth be told, in my eyes, you’re nothing more than trash.”
