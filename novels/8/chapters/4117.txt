Chapter 4117 - Fear

What was restricting Chu Feng was oppressive might.

That oppressive might was far superior to the oppressive might of an Utmost Exalted’s oppressive might. It was a martial power even more powerful than the martial power of an Utmost Exalted.

If Chu Feng’s guess was correct, that should be a Martial Exalted’s oppressive might.

Even amongst Utmost Exalted, there were countless individuals capable of easily killing Chu Feng.

If a Martial Exalted wanted to kill them, a single thought would be sufficient.

At that moment, Chu Feng felt that they were done for.

Right at that moment, a furious shout sounded, “Release me! Do you know who I am?!”

“If you dare touch us, I will have your entire Netherworld Ice Hall be buried with us!”

It was actually Fumo Shaoyu.

As Chu Feng looked to Fumo Shaoyu, he discovered that he had a look of panic on his face.

From how his body shivered, Chu Feng could tell that he was extremely scared.

It was precisely because Chu Feng could tell that he was scared that Chu Feng was surprised that he could say such unyielding words at that moment.

Was this not courting death?

“Audacious zealot, I’ve already spared your life once. Yet, you actually do not know how to repent?”

“Since you insist on dying, I will help you.”

“Die!”

Right at that moment, the fierce and vicious voice sounded again.

At the same time as the voice sounded, Chu Feng felt an enormous change to his surroundings.

It was killing intent.

The killing intent was not particularly strong. However, when the killing intent was added to the enormously powerful oppressive might, it created an extremely terrifying power.

Even though there was clearly no change to their surroundings, Chu Feng felt as if he had fallen into hell.

At the same time as the voice shouted, Chu Feng felt that his life was going to come to an end.

The four of them would all die there.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, a ray of light appeared from the sky and enveloped Chu Feng and the others.

The light not only blocked that oppressive might, but it also dispersed the killing intent.

Following that light, a figure and a spirit formation gate appeared.

That figure was none other than Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin’er’s grandmother, the old granny.

The old granny’s body was emitting the same sort of light as the light that had separated everything and enveloped Chu Feng and others.

Chu Feng knew that it was that old granny that had saved them.

“Grandma, you’ve come in the end. I knew that you wouldn’t let us die.”

Fumo Xin’er rushed over to her grandma in joy and tightly hugged her.

“Stop acting like a spoiled bitch and leave immediately.”

“All of you scram back to the sealed territory. Without my permission, you are not allowed to come out,” the old granny said as she pointed to the spirit formation gate.

Hearing that, Fumo Shaoyu did not hesitate. He grabbed Little Fishy with one hand and Chu Feng with his other hand. Then, he went into the spirit formation gate. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Fumo Xin’er ran into the spirit formation gate right after him.

Upon entering the spirit formation gate, the four of them arrived at a spirit formation tunnel.

After passing through the tunnel, they found that they’d appeared far away from the Netherworld Ice Hall. They were unable to even catch sight of the Netherworld Ice Hall at that moment. They were in a very safe location.

“What a powerful spirit formation,” Chu Feng looked up to the still squirming spirit formation gate and gasped in admiration.

Then, he looked at Fumo Xin’er and asked, “Exactly what is your grandma’s world spirit techniques’ level?”

As the old granny’s spirit formation had been very concealed, Chu Feng was unable to determine what her level of world spirit techniques were at.

The only thing he was certain of was that the old granny’s world spirit techniques far surpassed his own.

“We don’t know the specifics either. We actually do not know how powerful our grandma is,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the spirit formation gate started to tremble violently. The spirit formation gate that they’d come from actually closed shut.

However, the old granny had not come out of it.

“Could it be that some sort of accident had happened?” Chu Feng was very worried.

“That’s improbable.”

“If it’s my grandma, she should be able to safely escape. Perhaps she was thinking for our sake by severing that spirit formation gate,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“Don’t overthink things. Let’s leave this troublesome area,” added Fumo Shaoyu.

Seeing that the siblings were extremely confident in their grandma, Chu Feng stopped asking about.

After all, in terms of understanding, the two of them most definitely knew their grandma far better than he did.

With that, the four of them set off towards the sealed territory.

After all, judging from the situation at that moment, the safest place in the entire Heaven-devouring Realm would be the sealed territory.

......

Netherworld Ice Hall. Outside the main hall.

Silhouettes densely packed the sky and ground. They were all standing orderly.

It was an army of tens of thousands. They’d surrounded the main hall with multiple layers.

Those were all troops from the Netherworld Ice Hall.

The person leading the army was an old man clad in frost-ice armor.

That person had a fierce look on his face. Just by looking at him, one would be intimidated and would not dare to trifle with him.

The oppressive might that he emitted shook both heaven and earth.

He was the Netherworld Ice Hall’s Hall Master, a Martial Exalted-level expert.

It was due to him that the Netherworld Ice Hall had gained their current status.

He was equivalent to a god in the Netherworld Ice Hall. Everything was under his rule.

Generally, the old man would have an expressionless face. After all, everything was under the grasp of his palm. Very rarely were there things that could surprise him.

However, at that moment, the Netherworld Ice Hall’s Hall Master actually had a slight frown on his face.

His aged yet vicious eyes were staring at the direction of the main hall.

The main hall had originally been sealed by him using his oppressive might.

At that moment, his oppressive might had been withdrawn. Yet, there was a body of light that covered the sky and the ground, sealing off the main hall.

That body of light was extremely dazzling. Because of that, the entire Netherworld Ice Hall had become particularly bright.

However, most important of all would be how that body of light was able to block the Netherworld Ice Hall’s Hall Master’s oppressive might.

Actually, when the Netherworld Ice Hall’s Hall Master had been provoked by Fumo Shaoyu, he had planned to kill all of them.

It was precisely that body of light that had blocked his attack.

That was the reason why the Netherworld Ice Hall’s Hall Master was frowning.

It meant that there was actually someone in the Heaven-devouring Realm capable of contending against him.

There was someone that could shake his position.

“Who are you?” the Netherworld Ice Hall’s Hall Master asked with a stern voice.

“Buzz~~~”

Right after his words left his mouth, that body of light suddenly shone particularly brightly.

Then, the body of light began to spread.

The light was so dazzlingly bright that the people from the Netherworld Ice Hall found themselves unable to open their eyes.

Furthermore, as the light spread it also brought along an enormous force with it. With the main hall as the center, it spread all around the Netherworld Ice Hall.

The impact was simply too strong. Even the Netherworld Ice Hall’s Hall Master was forced to retreat tens of thousands of meters by the force before finally stabilizing himself.

When the impact dissipated, the Netherworld Ice Hall’s Hall master looked up again. Upon doing so, his expression changed enormously.

He was no longer simply frowning. Instead, his face showed an expression of deep fear.
