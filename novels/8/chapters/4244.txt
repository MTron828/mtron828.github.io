Chapter 4244 - On The Dragon Disclosure Stone

Old Man Compliance flicked his wrist, and a cyan stone appeared in his hand.

He raised his arm, and the cyan stone immediately began expanding in size.

At the beginning, it was only the size of a stone. But in the blink of an eye, it had transformed into a giant object that was over tens of thousands of meters long.

It floated in midair, and covered the entire sky.

That was the Dragon Disclosure Stone, a treasure that could reveal a martial cultivator’s Dragon Transformation Sensation.

At that moment, all the martial cultivators present immediately soared into the sky and onto the stone. They all wanted to get a good viewing spot for the upcoming showdown between geniuses.

Old Man Compliance, Chu Feng and Lu Jie also flew onto the Dragon Disclosure Stone.

Chu Feng was the first to land on it.

“Buzz---”

Once Chu Feng landed, a semitransparent body of light shone from beneath Chu Feng’s feet.

The body of light had been sent out by the Dragon Disclosure Stone, and had enveloped Chu Feng.

A veined pattern appeared on the body of light. It was a pattern resembling a dragon. That dragon began drifting around Chu Feng.

“Rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.”

Seeing the pattern that had appeared on the body of light, the crowd were not too surprised.

If it were another person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age, they might be surprised by this.

But, Chu Feng was no ordinary person of the younger generation. He was also the genius that had managed to stand firm on the Talent Steps’ third step.

With his talent, people felt that it was only natural that he had reached rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation as a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age.

Instead, if Chu Feng hadn’t reached rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, they would think that he had failed to live up to his talent.

“Woosh---”

Suddenly, another figure descended from midair and landed on the Dragon Disclosure Stone.

It was Lu Jie!

Once Lu Jie landed, a body of light identical to the one that had enveloped Chu Feng appeared from beneath his feet.

The body of light soon formed a pattern identical to the one on Chu Feng’s body of light.

The pattern resembled a dragon but wasn’t a dragon. It was emitting a special sort of aura as if it were alive.

Soon, a second dragon-like pattern appeared.

Following that, a third dragon-like pattern appeared.

“Rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation?!”

“Lu Jie has actually grasped rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation?!”

Seeing the three dragon-like patterns that had appeared around Lu Jie, the crowd burst into a complete uproar.

Even Chu Feng revealed a look of surprise.

According to the rumors, Lu Jie should’ve only comprehended rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation.

But, it would appear that rumors were merely rumors. When Lu Jie landed on the Dragon Disclosure Stone, his true strength had been revealed.

Lu Jie had comprehended rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation.

Rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation would give one battle power comparable to a rank six Utmost Exalted.

It was a level of strength that the current Chu Feng could not contend against.

“Don’t be afraid. I will suppress my power. I will not use my real strength to handle you.”

Lu Jie looked at Chu Feng with a mocking gaze.

Earlier, he had been greatly infuriated after being insulted by Chu Feng. Now, he was finally able to turn things around.

So what if his talent was inferior to Chu Feng’s? His strength far surpassed Chu Feng’s.

At least, that was the case now. But, that would suffice.

After all, cultivators were people that lived in the present.

The reason for that was because many exceptionally talented people would be killed and never have the chance to realize their future potential.

“Use these Dragon Restriction Bracelets,” Old Man Compliance said all of a sudden.

As he spoke, he raised his hand, and two bracelets flew towards Lu Jie.

Those bracelets seemed to be made out of stone. Both their aura and their construction greatly resembled the Dragon Disclosure Stone. Yet, they were different from the Dragon Disclosure Stone.

“Never would I have expected Old Man Compliance to care about Chu Feng this much.”

“Could it be that Chu Feng is your disciple?”

Lu Jie did not immediately place the Dragon Restriction Bracelets on his wrists. Instead, he raised his head to look to Old Man Compliance.

Once he said those words, the crowd immediately began to wonder.

Old Man Compliance was not only the master of the Ancient Compliance Castle, his strength was also very powerful.

But, never had they heard of him having any disciples.

Yet, Chu Feng had not only discovered the Hidden Gate, but had also ascended the Talent Steps.

Furthermore, Old Man Compliance was very concerned about the match between Chu Feng and Lu Jie.

Judging from this, it might be truly possible that they already knew one another.

Perhaps Lu Jie’s guess was correct.

Perhaps Chu Feng was really Old Man Compliance’s disciple.

Suddenly, a voice sounded. Then, Grandmaster Tang Chen appeared. “This old man can testify that Chu Feng does not have any relationship with Old Man Compliance.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Tang Chen?”

The crowd’s expressions changed upon seeing Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Grandmaster Tang Chen was one of the most renowned world spiritists in the Holy Light Galaxy.

Furthermore, the people all felt that Grandmaster Tang Chen would comprehend rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation sooner or later.

Although there were a great number of grandmaster world spiritists, Grandmaster Tang Chen was one of the most renowned.

Nevertheless, someone still voiced the question. “Grandmaster Tang Chen, how can you determine that this Chu Feng is not Old Man Compliance’s disciple?”

Whilst Grandmaster Tang Chen possessed both strength and prestige, he still had to show proof to testify for Chu Feng. Else, it would be a baseless claim, and difficult for people to believe.

“This old man knows Chu Feng’s master.”

“Unfortunately, I am unable to reveal who he is.”

“But, you all will one day learn who he is,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Tang Chen knows him?”

“Who could it possibly be?”

The crowd grew even more curious after hearing those words.

“Lu Jie, don’t bother wasting this old man’s time.”

“If you don’t dare to put on the bracelets, you can withdraw right now,” said Old Man Compliance. There was a trace of annoyance in his voice.

His reaction was understandable.

Earlier, Lu Jie had deliberately instigated the crowd and had made them think that Chu Feng had some sort of relationship with Old Man Compliance.

His intention was clear; he was trying to criticize Old Man Compliance for discriminating in favor of Chu Feng.

However, Old Man Compliance clearly didn’t discriminate in favor of anyone. He was merely trying to uphold fairness. That was the entire reason why he had proposed the Dragon Disclosure Stone and Dragon Restriction Bracelets.

“Humph.”

Lu Jie snorted. Then, he placed the two bracelets onto his wrists.

After putting on the bracelets, the body of light that had enveloped Lu Jie only displayed a single dragon-like pattern. The other two dragon-like patterns had both undergone changes.

They had turned transparent. Their extraordinary aura had also disappeared.

The crowd was not surprised by this.

That was the power of the Dragon Restriction Bracelets. Standing on the Dragon Disclosure Stone with the Dragon Restriction Bracelets on, Liu Jie’s world spirit techniques would be restricted.

At that moment, Lu Jie had two ranks of Dragon Transformation Sensation restricted by the bracelets. He now only possessed the power of rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.

Unless he left the Dragon Disclosure Stone or removed the Dragon Restriction Bracelets, he would not be able to utilize his other two levels of Dragon Transformation Sensation.

“Is it fair now?”

Lu Jie looked at Chu Feng. There was a mocking smile on his face.

Facing Lu Jie’s provocation, Chu Feng also smiled. He said, “Have you prepared yourself for defeat?”
