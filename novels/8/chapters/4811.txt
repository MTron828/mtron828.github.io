Chapter 4811: A Secret Inside the Tower

Chu Feng took a deep breath and walked right into the Hidden Dragon Life Tower without any hesitation.

The first thing that appeared before his eyes were mountains made out of bones, but at the same time, he felt peculiar energy seeping into his soul, stealing his life force. Other than that, there was nothing of note.

“Chu Feng, how are you feeling?” Yu Sha asked worriedly.

This was a tower that took the life of those who dared to venture into its midst after all.

“There’s no need to worry. If all it takes is my life force, there’s nothing to fear,” Chu Feng said.

“Why are you not afraid? Do you mean some kind of means against it?” Yu Sha asked.

“Not really, but I have consumed many treasures that increased my lifespan, so my lifespan should be much longer than the average cultivator,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

In the blink of an eye, he had already reached the fifth floor. The rate at which his life force was getting sapped increased greatly, but he still didn’t feel any discomfort.

Soon, he was already on the seventh floor.

By this point, he was starting to feel a little weak, and he sensed that something was threatening his life. It was not to say that he didn’t have enough lifespan to handle the rate of depletion. In fact, it turned out that his lifespan was extremely long enough for him to feel decently energized at the moment. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It made him feel extremely gleeful.

He had heard many incredible things about the treasures he had consumed, and he had wondered if they were really that incredible. However, from the looks of it, it seemed they were indeed amazing treasures. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such ample life force.

In other words, the danger he felt didn’t originate from the depletion of his life force. It was coming from something else.

Nevertheless, he still continued heading up. When he arrived at the eighth level, the sense of danger grew even greater. On top of that, he realized that there was something amiss with the eighth floor. There were marks of battle around, as well as a weird aura lingering in the air.

It felt like there used to be something here, just that it had been taken away.

“Chu Feng, are you still able to hold on?” Yu Sha asked.

She was asking this because she could hear Chu Feng’s breathing getting much heavier. His footsteps had also grown louder and a little wobbly. It was clear that Chu Feng was starting to get extremely weak.

“I-I’m fine,” Chu Feng said.

His voice was much feebler than Yu Sha expected. She wanted to tell him to turn around and leave, but she knew that it would be impossible for her to stop him. After all, he was already on the verge of breaking Dugu Lingtian’s record, so he would surely push himself forward no matter how hard it was.

She was right. Chu Feng’s footsteps didn’t halt despite the difficulties he was facing.

He gathered his resolve and staggered to the ninth floor, the place where Dugu Lingtian halted his footsteps.

It also gave off the same feeling as he felt back on the eighth floor. There were clearly marks of battle around, and it seemed like something used to be here too. The biggest difference between the two floors was probably the presence of Dugu Lingtian’s name on the wall.

“Dugu Lingtian must have found out about something. He didn’t challenge this place for no reason. I just wonder what did he and the elder who had reached the eighth floor take away from the Hidden Dragon Life Tower. I’m certain that the Hidden Dragon Life Tower isn’t as simple as others put it out to be.”

With such thoughts in mind, Chu Feng continued climbing toward the tenth floor. He was certain that he would receive his answers there.

Putong!

But on the steps leading to the tenth floor, Chu Feng’s knees suddenly caved in and fell onto the ground.

“Damn it!”

Chu Feng raised his head to take a look, but there were still long stairs leading up to the tenth floor. He clenched his fist in indignance.

“Chu Feng, what’s wrong? Let me out. I’ll help you!” Yu Sha said.

“There’s no need for that. I’m fine. It’s just that... it seems like I’ve reached my limit here,” Chu Feng said.

He wanted to climb to the tenth floor to take a look, but it seemed like this was the limit of his capabilities for the time being. So, he took out a sword and inscribed his name on the stairs.

He had been paying attention along the way, and it seemed like the place where one inscribed one’s name would be reflected in a similar position outside the tower too. The place where he inscribed his name was further than that of Dugu Lingtian’s, so he should be deemed to have broken Dugu Lingtian’s record.

So, after leaving his name behind, he began making his way down. He was thankful that he had turned back in time.

Just the pressure from walking up the stairs was already incredibly terrifying, but the pressure would only continue to increase the higher he climbed. If he had pushed on, it was likely that he might meet his end before he could even reach the tenth floor.

While he was curious to know the secret of the Hidden Dragon Life Tower, he decided to prioritize his life here.

It was fortunate that the pressure on each floor was fixed, and the pressure was gradually lightening as Chu Feng headed down the floors.

By the time he reached the first floor, other than the beads of sweat staining his clothes, he was already completely at ease, not feeling the slightest burden at all.

‘He’s out! Chu Feng, how are you feeling?”

Xia Yan, Li Muzhi, and the others quickly rushed forward and enquired Chu Feng’s condition.

“Do I look unwell to you?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

“But... you left your name at a place ahead of Lord Dugu Lingtian. How could you possibly be fine?! Is that just a place for you to bathe?” Li Muzhi asked after seeing that Chu Feng was indeed completely fine, just that his clothes were a little wet.

“What bathe? This is my sweat!” Chu Feng replied.

“Chu Feng, are you really fine? Did you sustain any internal injuries?” Xia Yan asked worriedly.

“I’m really fine. Eyy, stop tugging on my clothes. Don’t you know that a man and a woman should maintain some distance between one another? Why are you peeking into my clothes?” Chu Feng exclaimed.

“Who is peeking into your clothes? I’m just worried about you!”

Xia Yan felt a little embarrassed being told such words by Chu Feng in public. However, it would appear that Chu Feng was indeed completely fine despite their worries.

“Chu Feng, is this for real? How are you able to enter the Hidden Dragon Life Tower so easily? It was completely different when I entered myself,” Li Muzhi said.

“You have entered the Hidden Dragon Life Tower before?” Chu Feng asked.

“Cough cough. To be honest, I was young and ignorant then, so I snuck in. The moment I entered, I felt my life force quickly sapping out of me, so I ran out right away. Could the tower have changed from before?” Li Muzhi asked.

“Do you want to head in to give it another try?” Chu Feng asked.

“Forget it. There’s nothing to be gained from entering the tower anyway. I’m not going to even bother with it!” Li Muzhi turned down the suggestion right away.
