Chapter 2097 - Eternal Nightmare

Chu Feng rapidly approached the Magma Emperor. In the blink of an eye, he was already less than three thousand meters away from the Magma Emperor.

Logically, in a normal situation, Chu Feng would be able to kill his opponent using merely his oppressive might when at such a close distance.

After all, people of Chu Feng’s level of cultivation were capable of unleashing their martial power with a single thought. They could call upon the wind and summon the rain, turning a range of ten thousand miles to utter destruction in an instant.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng’s opponent was not an ordinary. Instead, it was the Magma Emperor, who was practically undefeated ten thousand years ago. It was a nightmare in the hearts of countless people ten thousand years ago. Even to this day, it was still the most frightening existence in the eyes of countless individuals from the Holy Land of Martialism.

Thus, Chu Feng’s oppressive might was simply unable to injure the Magma Emperor in the slightest. Even if he were to instantly destroy everything within ten thousand miles, he would still not be able to cause the slightest bit of harm to the Magma Emperor.

Faced with an opponent like that, the only thing Chu Feng could do would be to fight it at close range using martial skills.

“Bang, bang, bang~~~”

When Chu Feng was less than two thousand meters away from the Magma Emperor, the Magma Emperor was shooting out balls of magma nonstop. Not only were those balls of magma extremely large, they were also very powerful. They were simply not comparable to the fireballs it had shot out earlier.

In that sort of situation, even though Chu Feng was holding the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader, he was simply unable to approach the Magma Emperor.

In fact, Chu Feng had to use Taboo Martial Skills in order to ward off the Magma Emperor’s attacks.

Although Chu Feng was indeed capable of withstanding the Magma Emperor’s attacks after utilizing his various techniques, he was withstanding them with great difficulty.

From a single glance, the superior party and inferior party of the battle could be seen.

“This won’t do. That Magma Emperor is too powerful. It’s impossible for Chu Feng to be its match. We cannot continue to watch without doing anything,” The White Tiger was unable to continue watching the battle. It was very worried that Chu Feng would be injured.

Chu Feng had utilized his Imperial Armament from the very beginning. However, the White Tiger knew that the Magma Emperor had an Imperial Armament in its body too. That Imperial Armament was extremely powerful.

The Magma Emperor had yet to use its Imperial Armament. However, he was already able to suppress Chu Feng. If the Magma Emperor were to use its Imperial Armament, one could very well imagine the consequences.

In fact, the way the White Tiger saw it, it was clear what the outcome of the battle would be. No matter how powerful Chu Feng was, he would still be no match for the Magma Emperor.

However, the Azure Dragon spoke to stop the White Tiger. “Wait a bit longer.”

“If Chu Feng is really no match for the Magma Emperor, he would request our assistance.” It was not that the Azure Dragon wasn’t worried about Chu Feng. Rather, it wanted to respect Chu Feng’s decision.

In its impression, Chu Feng was not a reckless individual. Since Chu Feng had decided to take on the Magma Emperor alone, it meant Chu Feng must have his own plan. The Azure Dragon also wished to see exactly what Chu Feng had in mind.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, the Magma Emperor suddenly extended its enormous hand and grabbed Chu Feng.

As the Magma Emperor possessed an enormous body, his hand was like a small mountain crushing down on Chu Feng. Immediately, Chu Feng vomited a mouthful of blood.

“Crap!” Seeing that scene, the Four Great Divine Beasts were all unable to contain themselves. They moved their enormous bodies and arrived before the Magma Emperor. They planned to attack the Magma Emperor to stop it.

However, right at that moment, Chu Feng shouted at them, “Seniors, please stay your hands!!!”

“......” Hearing those words, the Four Great Divine Beasts were all startled. They looked to Chu Feng with confused expressions.

As for Chu Feng, even though his mouth was full of blood, he was smiling calmly. He turned around and said, “I can take care of him.”

“Brat, what did you say? If this Emperor is to just exert a slight bit of strength, I will be able to crush you. Yet, you dare to continue to boast like that?”

“Oh, I got it. You’re afraid that I will torment you. Thus, you want me to let you die quickly. That is why you’re deliberately provoking me.”

“Not bad, not bad. Brat, I must admit that you’re quite smart. Unfortunately, this Emperor is even smarter than you. Trying to plot a scheme against this Emperor? You’re destined to be suppressed by my intelligence,” The Magma Emperor mocked.

“Puu...” At that moment, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, and spewed out a mouthful of, not blood, but loud laughter.

“I must admit that you’re a very amusing fellow. However, I will still eliminate you, since you’ve done too many evils and are not a good individual,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Your fucking grandmother! Brat, you truly have no shame, do you?” Seeing that Chu Feng dared to continue to insult it, the Magma Emperor was truly enraged. In anger, it said, “If I don’t teach you a lesson, you truly would not know the situation you’re in.”

Seeing that the Magma Emperor was furious, Chu Feng’s gaze grew sharp. With a cold tone, he said, “Magma Emperor, the person who doesn’t know what sort of situation they’re in is you.”

“Remember this moment. From this moment on, I, Chu Feng, will become your eternal nightmare.”

“What did you say?” The Magma Emperor asked furiously. It wasn’t that it was confused by what Chu Feng meant, but rather that it did not believe its ears.

In fact, it was not only the Magma Emperor. The Four Great Divine Beasts were also stupefied by Chu Feng’s words. While they had seen people that were unafraid of death, they had never seen someone court death like this.

“Ahhh!!!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly opened his mouth and then bit down on the Magma Emperor’s indestructible finger covered in rising flames.

“Snap~~~”

Following Chu Feng’s bite, a shattering sound was heard. Chu Feng had actually managed to damage the Magma Emperor’s body with his teeth.

“Noo!!!”

After the Magma Emperor’s finger was bitten, its expression changed enormously. Furthermore, it let out an extremely ear-piercing snarl.

Its voice was so ear-piercing that it brought forth large waves of seawater on the surface of the sea down below and shattered the space itself.

That sudden, unforeseen event shocked the Four great Divine Beasts even more. They were utterly puzzled by what was happening.

It was only when the Magma Emperor raised its other hand and extended it toward Chu Feng that the Four Great Divine Beasts were stunned. A never-before-seen fear appeared in their eyes.

At that moment, the other hand that the Magma Emperor extended toward Chu Feng was extremely slow-moving. It looked as if it were stuck.

In fact, at that moment, the several thousand meter-tall enormous body of the Magma Emperor was trembling nonstop. Furthermore, the trembling was growing more and more obvious.

When the shattered space returned to normal, the fiery red sky returned to normal. The Magma Emperor’s powerful oppressive might was fading away.

“Brat! What did you do to me?!”

“Stop! Stop immediately! Stop for this Emperor right now!!!”

The Magma Emperor continued to snarl. Even though its voice was still so loud and resounding, it had lost its intimidating might from before.

Most importantly, the extremely confident and demon-like Magma Emperor’s bright, sun-like eyes were flickering nonstop. Panic and fear completely filled its eyes.

“Heavens! What is going on here?!”

At that moment, the Four Great Divine Beasts slowly recovered from their stunned states. They looked to one another as the shock in their eyes further increased.

The reason for that was because they were surprised to discover that not only had the Magma Emperor’s powerful oppressive might faded away, even its body covered with blazing flames was changing.

The fiery flames that had been like demon claws were disappearing. They were returning to its body. Soon, that magma-like fiery body started to grow dim.

Soon after that, the enormous body of the Magma Emperor no longer possessed the frightening magma or flames. Furthermore, there was no trace of life left in it. It stood there like an enormous rock humanoid.
