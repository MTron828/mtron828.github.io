Chapter 5908: Terrible News

“Aren’t you putting our descendants on a pedestal too much?” the three-eyed old man asked.

“You said so yourself that this generation of descendants is likely to surpass you,” the old man in the palace said.

“Sansheng Qiankun and Sansheng Qiutian’s talents are above us. If I had not suppressed their bloodline powers to further enhance it through the sacred treasure, Sansheng Qiankun would not necessarily have paled in comparison to Chu Xuanyuan, and Sansheng Qiutian could have been on par with Chu Feng,” the three-eyed old man said.

“Now that the formation is complete, you can help them without the sacred treasure,” the voice in the palace said.

“Mmhm. I shall stop suppressing their bloodline power and instead elevate it to a greater height today.”

The three-eyed old man formed a hand seal. A tremendous amount of aura rose from the sacred mountain and converged in the Sacred Temple to form a formation. Once the formation was complete, the doors to the Sacred Temple opened.

All of the jars inside the Sacred Temple suddenly shattered.

Uwahhhhh!

Terrifying screams echoed. It was as if the gates to hell had been opened, and demons had been unleashed upon the mortal world. However, under the formation’s prowess, those screams quickly morphed into howls of agony.

All of the energies released by the jars converged together before flying out of the sacred mountain toward the Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen were still lingering on the streets when an aura emanating incomparable pressure suddenly appeared in the sky above them. Their faces paled in despair, as they thought that the end was upon them. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The aura suddenly divided into two; one made its way toward Sansheng Qiankun, and the other rushed toward Sansheng Qiutian.

Both Sansheng Qiankun and Sansheng Qiutian were pinned to the floor by the pressure, and they howled in agony when the auras entered their bodies.

The Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen wanted to save them, but there was nothing they could do to help. They could only watch helplessly as the terrifying auras tortured their clan chief and his son.

Only when the auras fully fused into their bodies was the crowd able to approach them.

“Lord Clan Chief, how are you feeling?” the clansmen asked with frightened faces.

However, the Three Saints Monstrous Clan Chief revealed an excited smile and said, “How do I feel? I never felt better before!”

“Me too!” Sansheng Qiutian rose to his feet too.

The crowd was bewildered. They were assaulted by a power so scary that it was a miracle that they were alive at all, but they were saying that they felt better than ever. Was there something wrong with their heads?

However, the crowd quickly realized that the two of them were not only fine, but they were emanating an incredible aura on top of that. It was coming not from their cultivation but their bloodline powers.

As fellow Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen, they could vividly sense it. Terrifying auras that suppressed even their souls were coming from the clan chief and his son—and those two were already trying their best to suppress the auras, or else it would have been much stronger.

“Lord Clan Chief, what’s going on?” Elder Sheng asked.

“It’s the sacred treasures inside the Sacred Temple!” the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief exclaimed.

When the energies seeped into their bodies, both the clan chief and his son instinctively knew that the energies were from the Sacred Temple’s black jars. They weren’t sure how this came to be, but they felt as if their bloodlines had been awakened.

It was not to say their bloodlines were weak before, but the tremendous power coming from their bloodlines right now made them feel as if their bloodlines had been dormant all this while.

“Could this be the sacred mountain’s true legacy?” Elder Sheng exclaimed in delight.

The crowd was curious about the truth, but more than that, they were just overjoyed that their clan chief and his son had attained such great power.

“Father, I believe the ancestor’s compass now. I feel like I can really become a saint now,” Sansheng Qiutian said.

“Good! I feel the same way too,” the clan chief replied with a chuckle.

The clan chief stopped suppressing his bloodline and fully unleashed his aura. Sansheng Qiutian did the same as well. This allowed all of the Three Saints Monstrous Clansmen present to sense how powerful their bloodlines had become, and it convinced them that both the clan chief and his son could become saints.

The duo in the sacred mountain’s palace saw everything that had happened.

“You didn’t keep anything for yourself; you gave it all to them. You’re going all out to nurture our descendants,” the voice inside the palace remarked.

“Those two are worth nurturing. I just need the real sacred treasure,” the three-eyed old man replied.

“What if Chu Feng can’t find it?” the voice inside the palace asked.

“He will,” the three-eyed old man replied confidently.

...

It didn’t take long for Chu Feng and Zi Ling to return to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

The first thing Chu Feng did was to look for the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and ask about how Jie Tianran and the others were doing. He was relieved to hear that Jie Tianran hadn’t appeared since, and the others from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion hadn’t made a move.

He had wanted to first treat Zi Ling’s injuries, but the latter knew that Chu Feng obtained a treasure from the Sacred Temple to observe the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city, so she said that she was fine for the time being and insisted on him heading there first.

Chu Feng didn’t think that the treasures inside the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city were more important than Zi Ling’s health, but Zi Ling wouldn’t budge on this matter.

Thus, he made his way to the area outside the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city once more with the aid of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

He activated the observation treasure he obtained from the Sacred Temple, and it was surprisingly useful. It didn’t take long before he entered the realm inside the main city.

“Congratulations on reaching here, young friend. You’ll be undergoing a trial. If you clear the trial, there’s a chance you may obtain the key to enter our Ancestral Martial Realm Sect,” Chu Feng heard a familiar voice echoing in his ears.

The towering gate slowly opened.

Chu Feng couldn’t help but feel nervous, as that was when Jie Tianran barged in and stopped him from entering the gate. Fortunately, Jie Tianran didn’t appear this time around, and the gate opened without a hitch.

Chu Feng stepped into the gate and found himself trapped inside a terrifying formation.

This formation was formidable, such that even prodigious world spiritists would struggle to decipher it. Even Chu Feng had to spend a great deal of effort before he was able to decipher it. He was glad that he had received Qin Jiu’s legacy, or else he might not have stood a chance.

Luckily, he pulled through in the end.

The formation dissipated, and his surroundings warped. A key floated in distant space.

Chu Feng had cleared the trial, but he wasn’t happy in the least. He noticed a formation stone monument beneath the key, and his name was inscribed on it. This was a mark of glory proving that he had cleared the trial.

The problem was that there was another name on the stone monument too—Jie Tianran.

And it was written above his name, indicating that it was already here by the time Chu Feng entered this space.

“Am I still a step late?” Chu Feng frowned.

This was terrible news.
