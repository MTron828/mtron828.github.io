Chapter 5856: The Treasure Surfaces

“No, it isn’t all contracting.”

The crowd initially thought that it was only a matter of time before the protective formation contracted to a point where all of its realms were fully exposed. If so, the protective formation would be rendered useless even if it wasn’t breached.

However, they quickly realized that only a small portion of the protective formation was contracting, and the rate of contraction was swiftly decreasing. This baffled them. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Are they going to attack them one by one?” someone suggested.

The contraction might be minor, but given sufficient time, they should be able to expose one of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s realms.

However, the contraction suddenly stopped.

It was a perplexing sight. It was as if a passageway had appeared amid a massive sphere, but this passageway was a part of the sphere too; the sphere hadn’t been breached. At the end of the passageway was where the black light spirit formation gate was.

Boom!

A light pillar suddenly emerged from the black light spirit formation gate. It shot outward, and its target was the formation realm of the Ancient Era’s clans.

“What are they doing? Are they committing suicide?”

The crowd was baffled.

Boom!

There was suddenly a burst of flame in the sky. Something had stopped the light pillar, which was weird as there was nothing in front of the light pillar at all.

“No, something’s wrong.”

Rather than to say that the light pillar had been stopped, it looked more as if something was devouring it. Eventually, something massive appeared.

It was a city, a ginormous one. Its scale was comparable to a smaller realm. It was majestic beyond compare. There was a gigantic plaque hanging at the entrance of the city, and what was written on it astounded the spectators.

“Ancestral Martial Realm Sect? Could this be the treasure they were looking for?”

“It turns out they were truly after the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasure! The rumors were false, after all. The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect doesn’t have any treasure.”

“I see, I see!”

The spectators widened their eyes in realization. They finally understood why the protective formation had only contracted by such a small degree. There was no need for the protective formation to fully retract, as they only needed to push this city out of its range.

This was their true motive!

Inside the formation realm of the Ancient Era’s clans, the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief excitedly roared, “It has finally appeared!”

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master closed his eyes and took a deep breath. The surviving Ancient Era’s clansmen also burst into joyful tears.

This battle had been a gamble, with countless lives of their clansmen as the wager.

Fortunately, they had won the bet. Their clans were only going to rise to a greater height from this point onward.

“Have I ever disappointed you?” Puppeteer Exalted asked with a gleeful voice.

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master opened his eyes, and the other five Ancient Era’s clan leaders looked at him. The six of them simultaneously unleashed a burst of energy and fused it into the formation realm.

A powerful sealing formation manifested. It comprised countless chains, each with a thickness of over a hundred meters.

This sealing formation spanned a huge area, covering the formation realm. However, it quickly contracted past the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders until it only spanned Puppeteer Exalted. By then, the hundred-meter-thick chains had become as thin as threads, but they still tightly bound him in place.

“Clan leaders, what do you mean by this?” Puppeteer Exalted asked.

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master walked up to Puppeteer Exalted and tugged the pendant off his neck. He fused his spirit power into the pendant, and it soon became transparent.

A mini formation realm was reflected in the pendant. It was filled with tens of millions of cultivators and world spiritists, and there was no lack of True God level cultivators and True Dragon World Spiritists among them. All of them were channeling a massive formation.

“You’re asking us what we’re doing, Puppeteer Exalted? You secretly liaised with so many present-era cultivators, but instead of having them fight alongside us, you had our clansmen sacrifice themselves to channel your formation,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master held the pendant as he asked.

The other five clan leaders also flew over and surrounded Puppeteer Exalted.

“Clan leaders, they have their purpose. It’s not time for them to make an appearance yet, which is why I didn’t say a word. You’ll see what I gathered them for soon,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

“Nonsense! Why didn’t you tell us in advance then? You’re withholding a hand in hopes of monopolizing the treasures,” the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief roared.

“You’re misunderstanding me. I have no such intention. I didn’t say a word because I was worried you might be opposed to working with the present-era cultivators,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

“Hah...” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master sneered. “Puppeteer Exalted, you’re looking down on us, Ancient Era’s clans. You better stop playing your tricks with us.”

“I’m not lying to you. I was about to tell you about it. Take a closer look at the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. It might have appeared, but it’s in a highly unstable state and can vanish at any moment. To put it frankly, what you’re seeing is an illusion; you won’t be able to enter it. However, I have a way to stabilize it. Your clansmen would have truly sacrificed themselves in vain if you killed me right now,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master and the others frowned.

While the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city had appeared, it had started flickering, looking as if it was about to disappear very soon.

“You had been dishonest with us, Puppeteer Exalted. We had no choice but to resort to this. However, you can be assured that we won’t take your life. We only bound you so that you would recognize your place. As long as you cooperate with us, we’ll give you your share of the treasure once it’s done,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master said.

Following that, the six clan leaders flew out of the formation realm with Puppeteer Exalted. They were making their way toward the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city.

Weng!

Just as they were about to reach their destination, a spirit formation gate appeared, and the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster walked out from within.
