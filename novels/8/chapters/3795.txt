Chapter 3795 - Chu Feng’s Friend?

“Weren’t you all inquiring about Ma Liang’s whereabouts, and intending to obtain justice for him?”

“Now that you know that Ma Liang was killed by me, how are you planning to settle this debt?” asked Chu Feng.

“Milord, this is a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.”

“We truly had no idea that Ma Liang had died. We were merely using his disappearance as a random excuse. We truly didn’t come to attack you, Milord," said the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster.

“A random excuse? In that case, did you know that the Watermirror Paradise’s headmaster is my friend?” asked Chu Feng.

“I had no idea. I truly had no idea.”

The Cloud Paradise’s headmaster became extremely nervous. The Lord Headmaster, a grand existence in the Seven Suns Mountain Range region, was so terrified that he was about to pee his pants.

It wasn’t that he lacked courage. Rather, he truly did not want to die.

He also knew very well that the person before him was someone that he could not afford to offend.

“Forget it. I will not make things difficult for you, you can stand back up.”

Chu Feng waved his hand.

“Thank you Milord. Thank you Milord.”

The Cloud Paradise’s headmaster nodded and bowed repeatedly. He kowtowed to Chu Feng for a very long time before finally standing up.

After standing up, he wiped the cold sweat off his face repeatedly. Even now, his body was still trembling. He was truly terrified.

“Headmaster Yang, you are truly unkind and insincere. If you had told me that such a grand existence was backing you up, I, Yun, would never have dared to cause trouble for you," said the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster.

“What are you...” The Watermirror Paradise’s headmaster didn’t know how to respond to those words.

He was feeling very wronged. After all, he hadn’t known that Chu Feng was so powerful either. Besides, he didn’t know Chu Feng very well at all.

Besides, even if he told the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster that, would he possibly believe him?

If the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster hadn’t witnessed Chu Feng’s strength with his own eyes, he would not be reacting in such a manner.

“Headmaster Yun, now that you know about the relationship that the Watermirror Paradise and I have, are you still going to cause trouble for them in the future?” asked Chu Feng.

“I wouldn’t dare. I wouldn’t dare. Milord, even if you are to give me a hundred times the nerve, I would still not dare,” said the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. Then, he said, “Headmaster Yun, I will ask you a question.”

“Milord, please ask away," said the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster.

“How long has your Cloud Paradise existed?” asked Chu Feng.

“Milord, our Cloud Paradise has existed for forty-three thousand eight hundred years exactly. Over these forty-thousand plus years, we have had a total of fifteen headmasters,” the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster answered in full detail.

“Listen carefully. You’d best behave yourself properly from today on. Not to mention not bullying the Watermirror Paradise, you are not allowed to bully people from any powers.”

“Otherwise... I will have your Cloud Paradise’s continued existence cease in your generation.”

“Understand?” asked Chu Feng coldly.

“Understood. Understood.”

The Cloud Paradise’s headmaster nodded his head repeatedly. The sweat that he had wiped away had once again covered his face. In fact, there was even more sweat than before.

What Chu Feng had said was no threat. Instead, it was a warning.

Killing intent had appeared in Chu Feng’s eyes as he said those words. That killing intent was the most intense and most terrifying killing intent he had ever seen.

In that instant, he saw the scene of his Cloud Paradise being completely extinguished.

Thus, he knew that Chu Feng was most definitely not lying. If he dared to commit any misdeeds, this seemingly ordinary-looking fellow would really bring ruin upon his Cloud Paradise.

“Enough. You can scram,” said Chu Feng.

“Milord, I’ll take my leave then.”

The Cloud Paradise’s headmaster hurriedly brought the people from the Cloud Paradise with him and left.

They left very quickly. However, their appearance looked very sorry.

“Sssss~~~”

Luo Zhi and the others that were hiding in the shadows and observing everything were unable to keep themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

Earlier, they’d witnessed with their very eyes the person that they considered to be a peak grand expert shivering in fear, kneeling and begging Chu Feng for forgiveness.

That scene had an enormous effect on their hearts. It left an indelible shadow in their hearts.

They had always dreamed of being able to get close to the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster or the Watermirror Paradise’s headmaster.

However, At a short while before, an existence even more powerful than the Cloud Paradise’s headmaster was right beside them; addressing them as brothers.

As for them, not only did they not cherish that opportunity, but they instead only planned to harm that person.

It was only at that moment that they realized how foolish they were.

“Brother Asura, you’re still here?”

“There seemed to be a fight earlier. I was very worried for you, are you alright?”

Luo Zhi walked out from the private room he was hiding in and walked to Chu Feng with a look of cordial eagerness on his face. He seemed like he’d seen his close friend of many years. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Luo Zhi was trying to mend the pen after the sheep were lost. He wanted to seize the opportunity to better his relationship with CHu Feng.

Even if he failed to establish a relationship with Chu Feng, he wanted to use the title of ‘Chu Feng’s close friend’ to establish good relations with the Watermirror Paradise. Should that happen, it would definitely be an enormous profit for him.

“Brother Asura, are you alright?”

“Why are you still there?”

Seeing Luo Zhi showing himself, the others also learned from his behavior, and ran over to Chu Feng attentively.

Even Wang Lian shamelessly ran over.

However, even though they acted so eagerly attentive, Chu Feng paid absolutely no attention to them. He acted as if he had not heard their shouts.

That said, those people were simply thick-skinned to the extreme. Even though he was ignoring them, they still inquiried about Chu Feng’s well-being nonstop.

Seeing that the situation seemed amiss, Yang Shenshen asked, “Senior Asura, do you know them?”

“It would be better to ask your Watermirror Paradise’s disciples whether or not I know them.”

Chu Feng looked to the several Watermirror Paradise disciples kneeling nearby.

Those people were Miao Yu’s lackeys. All of them were present when Miao Yu had captured Li Chuchu.

Thus, they’d all witnessed the scene earlier.

“Milord, how should we respond?”

After witnessing how powerful Chu Feng was, he was already a living god of death in their eyes.

They felt endless fear towards Chu Feng. They were even more afraid of him than their Lord Headmaster.

When Chu Feng’s gaze turned to them, they thought that he was planning to kill them. Thus, they truly did not know how to answer him.

“What happened earlier and what you all saw earlier, just tell them as they happened," said Chu Feng.

“Senior Asura is asking you whether or not these people are his friends.”

“Speak, and honestly! Why ask all these questions?!” Yang Shenshen shouted in annoyance.
