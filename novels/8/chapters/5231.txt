Chapter 5231: The Gentle But Dangerous Woman

Yue Ling was discussing with Bitter Remembrance and Song Yuwei about the house she wanted when she suddenly felt a surge of energy flowing into her body.

“Hm? This feeling…”

Yue Ling could tell that the energy was flowing in from elsewhere, but for some reason, it abruptly vanished before mysteriously appearing inside her dantian and flowing outward to the rest of her body.

It filled her with an incredibly comforting sensation as if some sort of energy was cleansing her body of the traumas it had suffered. Even her mind had gotten much clearer than before.

Next, she sensed an incredibly powerful bundle of energy settling down inside her dantian.

“Masters, m-my dantian…”

Sensing that something was amiss, she quickly turned to Bitter Remembrance and Song Yuwei for help. The two of them noticed the anomaly in Yue Ling’s expression and quickly checked on her dantian.

“Yue Ling, could it be that…?”

Both of their faces lit up in joy. They sensed that Yue Ling’s dantian had fully recovered as if someone had put a brand new one inside of her. On top of that, there was powerful energy inside her dantian that appeared to be some sort of bloodline ability.

“Masters, what happened to me? I feel like some kind of energy has awakened inside and is slowly assimilating with me,” Yue Ling said.

“Yue Ling, it turns out that you’re a prodigy, a true prodigy! That vicious woman tried to hurt you, but little did she know that she only helped you awaken your true bloodline!” Song Yuwei exclaimed in a rare bout of excitement.

She was feeling incredibly happy for Yue Ling after what the latter had been put through. It was the same for Bitter Remembrance too.

The newly-recovered dantian inside Yue Ling’s body was perfectly compatible with her, as if a power that had been lying dormant inside her body had finally awakened. That led them to believe that some kind of latent power had been lying asleep inside Yue Ling all this while, only to be awakened when her dantian finally shattered…

That power was the one who helped Yue Ling to reconstruct her dantian, and it would definitely bring her to greater heights once she resumed her cultivation.

Oblivious to them, a lady who went by the name of Ling’er was currently looking at them from the sky with a curl on her lips.

“So, this is how it feels to do good deeds and help others. Feels not too bad,” Ling’er murmured before leaving the valley.

She didn’t know that her appearance had provided a crucial clue to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was initially staring at the stone at a complete loss, not knowing how to proceed. However, the moment Ling’er passed through the stone, there was a subtle change in it that gave him a burst of inspiration.

Maybe I can use my world spiritist bloodline to breach the formation inside the stone instead of my spirit power. Such tricks wouldn’t work on ordinary formations, but they could have unexpected effects on certain unique formations and treasures.

It worked. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When Chu Feng used his world spiritist bloodline together with the world spirit techniques he had comprehended from the legacy of Yue Ling’s ancestors, he found that he was able to slip through the stone with ease.

That brought him into a beautiful passageway.

“Woah, Chu Feng. You have struck a gold mine. There’s clearly something extraordinary about this place,” Eggy yelled in excitement.

Her thrill was understandable, for this passageway they had just entered was clearly no ordinary place.

Chu Feng quickly flitted to the other end of the passageway, where he was met with the same beautiful sight that Ling’er had just witnessed a moment ago.

“It looks like someone is staying here?” Eggy said warily.

However, Chu Feng’s attention was drawn to the constellations in the sky, which formed a complete map of the vast world of cultivation.

He noticed that there was a blurry, massive avatar shrouding over one of the galaxies. It was hard to discern whether it was a human or a beast, but it was so huge that even realms that could house billions of living beings looked no different from a speck of dust before it.

The galaxy the avatar was looming over seemed to be the Seven Realms Galaxy.

“Eggy, what do you think that is?” Chu Feng asked.

As shocked as he was by the sight of the silhouette, he intuitively sensed that its presence over the Seven Realms Galaxy seemed to signify something.

“Chu Feng, put that aside for the moment. I don’t think we are in an ancient remnant… Someone seems to be living here. You need to tread carefully. Conceal yourself and don’t release your spirit power. If need be, you should only use your Heaven’s Eyes,” Eggy reminded.

“All right.”

Chu Feng snapped out of his shock and quickly concealed himself before scanning his surroundings using his Heaven’s Eyes.

There were no formations in the area, which allowed Chu Feng to scan his surroundings without any impediments. There were indeed traces of someone living here, evident from the treasures casually scattered around in the palaces. There was no effort put into hiding the treasures at all.

Chu Feng could tell that they were all priceless treasures. The pills were already the cheapest treasures inside the palaces, but they were already beyond his means to afford even if he bankrupted himself.

He looked at one of the weapons, and the weapon immediately trembled and emanated the aura of a conqueror. Even his Immemorial Hero’s Sword looked insignificant compared to that weapon.

“This is too tempting!” Chu Feng exclaimed.

Despite his excitement, he dared not to make a careless move. Just the fact that the owner of this place dared to leave their treasure lying around was proof of their strength, but why would someone that powerful choose to stay here?

Could this be related to the fortuitous encounter that led to Bitter Remembrance’s discovery of this secret realm?

If that was the case, he could be placing Bitter Remembrance in a bad position if he took away the treasures here. There was no way he would do something as vile as sabotaging his friends.

“Chu Feng, you should take the weapon,” Eggy urged.

“Not yet. I’ll first explore a while more. I hear sounds coming from that direction. Is that a dragon’s roar? I should go and take a look.”

Chu Feng quickly headed over, and it didn’t take him long to arrive before a turbulent golden lake. Gazing upon it from the sky, he could vaguely make out dragon silhouettes beneath the water surface.

Despite being mere silhouettes, these dragons emanated terrifying auras. They were neither serpents nor formation beasts but true dragons from the legends. Even with a quick glance, Chu Feng could already spot thousands of them, and there seemed to be more in the lake.

What shocked him the most was that these dragon were squirming in pain as if they were put through cruel torture. He could sense incredibly powerful energy flowing within the lake.

This was energy suitable for cultivating.

While he was reluctant to take those treasures, he didn’t want to miss this precious opportunity to further his cultivation. Thus, he began making his way toward the lake.

“How did you get in here?”

Just as Chu Feng was about to step into the lake, he heard a gentle voice sounding behind him. Alarmed, he quickly turned his head around and found himself faced with a beautiful woman. She had a graceful disposition and a gentle appearance, but Chu Feng sensed extreme danger from her.

She was fully dressed, but the golden droplets flowing down her cheeks clearly came from the lake.

“Elder, I didn’t mean to intrude,” Chu Feng replied with a bow.

“Don’t be afraid. I don’t intend to hurt you. You can consider me a friend of Master Bitter Remembrance.”

Sensing Chu Feng’s nervousness, the woman spoke with an even gentler voice than before.

Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing those words. He honestly told her how he was able to pass through the stone and enter this place.

“Come with me,” the woman said.

Chu Feng’s surroundings suddenly blurred. By the time he snapped out of it, he had already returned to the first cavern. The stone that he had passed through earlier was right in front of him, and the woman was standing beside it.

“I want you to enter using the same method as before to prove that you weren’t lying. If you aren’t able to do so…” A faint smile formed on the woman’s gentle face. “… I’ll take your life even if you are acquainted with Master Bitter Remembrance.”

“I hope that I don’t mess up in this crucial moment, or else I’ll be dead meat.”

Chu Feng did as he was told, but he felt a little jittery about this. He was worried that he had only succeeded by coincidence the previous time.

Fortunately, it wasn’t just a coincidence. He was able to pass through the stone and enter the passageway without a hitch.

To his surprise, the woman was standing right in front of him. She had passed through the stone a step earlier than him. Shock could be seen on her face.

“You inherited Lord Qin Jiu’s legacy… and you have the Ruler’s Bloodline on top of that?” she exclaimed with her euphonious voice.
