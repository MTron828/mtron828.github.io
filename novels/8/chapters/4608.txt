Chapter 4608: Unfathomable Lass

Chu Feng was unable to do anything about Song Yun’s stubbornness, so he could only bring her together with him in the end.

Following the directions on the map, he soon got to the location indicated on the map.

It was hidden in an ordinary forest.

Similar to the key formations he had encountered earlier, if one’s senses weren’t sharp enough, one wouldn’t be able to perceive the spirit formation gate even if one was standing right before it.

Chu Feng was still able to see the key formations with his Heaven’s Eye, but he was unable to see or sense the spirit formation gates at all.

“Big brother Chu Feng, are you sure this is it? To be frank with you, I’m a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist too. Even though my skills are nowhere on par with yours, I’m still quite confident in the keenness of my senses. However, I can’t sense anything here.”

Song Yun was not the type of person to stay still. She leaped to one of the tree branches above and shook her legs leisurely as she spoke to Chu Feng.

“Lass, you’re indeed quite talented, but you’re still too inexperienced. Take a look at this.”

With a smile, Chu Feng released his spirit power. Using his hand as a brush and his spirit power as ink, he swiftly painted out a peculiar formation before him. This formation was unusual in the sense that it had the form of a formation, but not the strength of one.

“This is... a constellation map?”

However, Song Yun’s eyes lit up upon seeing the formation.

She realized that the formation Chu Feng drew out was a part of the brilliant map covering the sky.

“Indeed. It looks like you’re still a qualified Saint-cloak World Spiritist.”

Chu Feng nodded in approval. He tapped his finger lightly, and the formation in front of him immediately drifted forward.

Weng!

However, the formation suddenly stopped moving, as if it had bumped into something, before abruptly dissipating away, scattering sparks all over the place. In the wake of the sparks, an object began to surface.

It was a stone door.

“Waaa, how incredible! You managed to find it!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Song Yun leaped down from the tree as she clapped her hands enthusiastically.

Even though there was nothing outstanding about the stone door, it was clear to her that this was one of the three spirit formation gates.

“Lass, I’ll first put it out here clearly. I don’t know where the spirit formation gate leads to, but it’s bound to have many lurking dangers. If you insist on following me in, I can’t guarantee your safety. I won’t be taking responsibility for anything that happens to you inside there,” Chu Feng told Song Yun.

“Don’t worry, big brother Chu Feng. I won’t cause any trouble for you! I also promise that I won’t become your burden too. If I reach my limits, I’ll immediately turn tail and run away.”

Song Yun looked at Chu Feng as she made a promise.

With her insisting on it so adamantly, Chu Feng had no choice but to bring her together with him.

As soon as the two of them passed through the spirit formation gate, the stone gate swiftly vanished from sight. However, it had only turned invisible once more,

The stone door was still right behind Chu Feng and Song Yun at the moment, which meant that they could choose to escape with things were to turn awry.

Seeing this, Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief before assessing his surroundings carefully.

The world beyond the spirit formation gate was a small cavern.

Chu Feng knew that this cavern was made out of a spirit formation, but it still looked as realistic as it could get to him. He was unable to discern anything amiss with it.

It showed that the world spiritist had already reached a level where he could confuse falsehood with reality. This made it clear that this world spiritist was far stronger than Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng’s attention wasn’t on whether the cavern was real or not at the moment. He was too busy trying to figure out the crux of the cavern.

He slowly walked forward, but barely after taking a few steps, he suddenly halted his footsteps. The reason behind that was because he realized that Song Yun wasn’t walking at all.

She was standing still on the spot with a lowered head, looking downcast.

Confused by her current state, Chu Feng asked concernedly, “Lass, what’s wrong?”

“Big brother Chu Feng, there’s something weird about the formation here. I think I’ll need to leave the area. Otherwise, I might implicate you,” Song Yun said.

However, Chu Feng was delighted to hear those words. From the start, he had never wanted to bring Song Yun in out of fear that something would happen to her. He wasn’t confident of ensuring her safety, thus he felt more at ease with her not around.

“Of course! It’s the crux of the second trial, so it’s bound to be dangerous. If you’re intending to leave, I’ll escort you out.”

Chu Feng turned around and dragged Song Yun toward the stone gate, hoping to take her out.

Despite Song Yun’s earlier obstinacy, this time around, she followed him obediently. However, just as they were about to step through the stone gate, she suddenly halted her footsteps.

“I’ll leave if you want me to, but you must eat this first,” Song Yun said as she took out a pill from inside her sleeves.

The pill was golden in color, but there were black bits on it. It looked reminiscent of a pearl.

“Lass, are you planning on poisoning me again?” Chu Feng asked as he examined the peculiar pill in front of him with a deep frown.

He found that he was unable to see through the nature of the pill.

“How rude! Big brother Chu Feng, when have I harmed you before? Hurry up and consume it. It’ll definitely help you later on!” Song Yun said.

“Fine fine fine, I’ll swallow it.”

Chu Feng took the pill and popped it into his mouth.

As soon as he swallowed it, he realized that the pill immediately headed right toward the depths of his soul. Following that, a bizarre aura began sweeping across his entire body, seemingly assimilating itself with him.

It was just that the speed of the assimilation was a little slow.

“Lass, what in the world is that pill?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s good stuff, you don’t need to worry about it. It’ll take some time for you to digest it, but I can assure you that you’ll thank me once you’re done with it! Alright, big brother Chu Feng, I’ll really be leaving now!”

Song Yun chuckled softly before heading out of the stone door.

“This lass, she always acts so mysteriously...”

Chu Feng shook his head as he watched Song Yun’s body disappear inside the stone door. He took another look at the pill inside his body, but he was still unable to discern what it was. In the end, he decided to just turn his attention away from it for the time being and focus on the formation inside the cavern.

Chu Feng would have never imagined that the pill he just ate was actually the real Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. However, it wasn’t the pure Divine Rejuvenation Pearl because Song Yun had mixed another ingredient into it.

Song Yun had headed out of the stone door with a smile, but when she reappeared once more, her face had already turned incredibly livid.
