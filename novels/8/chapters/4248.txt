Chapter 4248 - Outcome Determined

The power released from the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was extremely terrifying. It was a power that was stronger than rank two Utmost Exalteds.

It was a power hundreds of times stronger than the power of Chu Feng’s grand slaughtering formation.

Yet, it just so happened that that power had changed direction, and was moving to attack Lu Jie instead.

“Was it Chu Feng?”

“Did he manipulate that power?”

“But, that’s clearly the power from the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.”

“How was he able to manipulate it?”

Everyone realized that it was Chu Feng who had altered the direction of the attack.

But they were unable to understand how Chu Feng had done it.

“Damn it!”

Seeing that the situation was bad, Lu Jie immediately increased his control of the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.

With that, the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation opened its mouth even wider. The suction power emitted by it then grew even stronger.

With that, the attack that had been sent back toward it started being devoured by the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.

But, even with that being the case, Lu Jie was unable to smile.

“What sort of despicable trick did you use?”

With his brows narrowed, Lu Jie glowered at Chu Feng.

“Despicable trick?”

Chu Feng revealed a contemptuous smile. He felt Lu Jie to be truly hilarious.

“If you didn’t use a despicable trick, how could you possibly accomplish such a thing?” Lu Jie was still unwilling to accept reality.

He refused to believe that Chu Feng was able to use ordinary means to control the power that had been unleashed by his spirit formation.

“You’re still unable to understand?”

Chu Feng smiled again. Then, Chu Feng’s hand seals changed again. He actually retrieved the elemental energies. The power of the elemental energies that had entered the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation actually began to rush out from its mouth.

Even though the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was clearly emitting a terrifying suction, it was unable to devour Chu Feng’s elemental energy. Instead, the elemental energies were rushing out from it.

Soon, all the elemental energy that devoured by the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation had rushed out of its mouth.

Seeing this, the crowd were all struck dumb.

Then, Chu Feng’s hand seals changed again. He lightly shouted, “Formation, reveal yourself.”

“Boom---”

In the next instant, the power of Chu Feng’s slaughtering formation increased by multiple folds. It was like a volcanic eruption.

Adding the power that had accumulated previously, the power of Chu Feng’s slaughtering formation had reached an unimaginably terrifying level.

The five elemental powers of wind, lightning, water, fire and earth gathered together to form a giant creature tens of thousands of meters tall.

Surging flames, devastating lightning, rushing waters and violent winds covered that giant creature.

Before that giant creature, Lu Jie’s Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was reduced to insignificance by comparison.

It was like a small hill being placed at the foot of a mountain.

It was like an ant standing before a lion.

Most importantly, Lu Jie began utilizing his full strength upon noticing that the situation had turned bad for him.

Under his full strength, the suction emitted by the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation had reached an unprecedented level.

The mountains in the distance began crumbling. The earth beneath his feet also started shattering. Even the clouds far away were being sucked in.

It seemed like everything in the world was about to be sucked into its mouth. That was truly a giant creature capable of devouring the heavens.

Yet, it just so happened that the giant beast composed of five elemental energies that stood closest to the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation was completely unaffected by it.

The Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation that was able to devour everything was akin to an empty display now. It was unable to affect Chu Feng’s slaughtering formation at all.

“Is this... the true power of Chu Feng’s slaughtering formation?”

Seeing the power displayed by the two spirit formations, the crowd finally realized the vast disparity between them.

“Lu Jie, do you understand now?”

“This is the disparity between our spirit formations. It is also the disparity between you and I,” Chu Feng said to Lu Jie.

He still had a smile on his face, still standing in the same place with a look of contempt. Chu Feng have had that attitude the entire time, never once changing in his confrontation against Lu Jie.

But, when the crowd looked at him again, they felt a complete upheaval in their hearts, a complete transformation.

At that moment, victory was leaning in Chu Feng’s favor.

Furthermore, it had been in Chu Feng’s favor the entire time.

It was just that the crowd had only just realized how powerful Chu Feng, that youngster that had appeared for the first time was.

Lu Jie had been defeated.

He had been utterly defeated.

Chu Feng’s performance had completely won over the crowd.

Lu Jie did not become weaker. He was still as powerful as before.

Unfortunately, he had encountered a true monster.

That monster would change Lu Jie’s status.

That monster would replace Lu Jie as the actual strongest world spiritist of the Holy Light Galaxy’s younger generations.

“I’ll kill you!”

Suddenly, Lu Jie shouted furiously.

He was still unwilling to accept reality, and put forth a final struggle.

But, he did not attack with his spirit formation. Rather, he moved his hand to remove the Dragon Restriction Bracelets.

“Roar---”

However, right when his movements were exposed, before he could remove the Dragon Restriction Bracelets from his wrists, the five elemental energies rushed toward him.

The giant beast had arrived before Lu Jie in an instant. With devastating power, it moved to oppress him.

“Woosh---”

But, at the moment of imminent peril, over twenty figures arrived before Lu Jie, shielding him behind them.

Acting together at the same time, the power unleashed by those people far surpassed that of a rank two Utmost Exalted.

Before such power, no matter how powerful Chu Feng’s slaughtering formation was, it was no match. In an instant, the giant beast had crumbled.

Those twenty-plus individuals were all disciples of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted. They were all Lu Jie’s senior brothers and sisters.

The strongest among them had not only grasped rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation, he was also a rank eight Utmost Exalted. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He was the second strongest disciple of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, beneath only the All-seeing Heavenly Master.

His name was Ouyang Wending.

Ouyang Wending did not immediately pull back his attack after destroying Chu Feng’s grand slaughtering formation. Instead, he controlled his rank eight Utmost Exalted-level oppressive might to press toward Chu Feng.

Although the oppressive might was intangible, it concealed murderous desires.

That Ouyang Wending intended to kill Chu Feng!

But, before his oppressive might could even reach Chu Feng, it dissipated into thin air.

Following that, a figure appeared before Chu Feng.

It was Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Ouyang Wending, could it be that you all are planning to act like sore losers?” Grandmaster Tang Chen asked sternly after neutralizing Ouyang Wending’s attack.

“That child attempted to kill my junior brother. He has committed a capital offense,” said Ouyang Wending.

“Capital offense?”

“Who do you think you are? Since when were you able to determine the life and death of others?” asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Tang Chen, step aside immediately. Otherwise... do not blame me for being rude.”

Ouyang Wending was not afraid of Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Even though he knew that his strength was no match for Grandmaster Tang Chen’s, he still wasn’t afraid.

Of course, his confidence did not come from his own strength.

Everyone knew that his confidence originated from his master, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.

Grandmaster Tang Chen raised his brows. A look of displeasure appeared on his face. “This old man will give you one last chance.”

“Scram out of this old man’s sight right now. Or else, I will have your life.”

“Tang Chen, are you really planning to go against my master?”

Sure enough, Ouyang Wending brought up his master’s name.

Grandmaster Tang Chen didn’t answer him. Yet, he had released his oppressive might.

Not only that, but his oppressive might also contained boundless killing intent.

The bystanders were all unable to sense anything.

Only Lu Jie, Ouyang Wending and their fellow disciples felt like they’d fallen into a vortex of death.

Should that vortex spin in the slightest, all of them would die.

“You...”

Seeing that, Ouyang Wending finally narrowed his brows.

Then, he turned around and led Lu Jie and his other junior brothers and sisters and flew away.
