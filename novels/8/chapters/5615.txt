Chapter 5615: Rank Six Against Rank Seven

Chu Feng noticed many fortuitous encounters in the realm, but he chose the most obscure one of all. He was aware that he had lost the initiative due to his late arrival, and he thought the most obscure one had the highest possibility of being overlooked by others.

He quickly made his way over after confirming his destination. It was a mountain.

Along the way, he stumbled upon many aerial beasts and land beasts, but surprisingly, there was not a single living being in the mountain. The mountain was barren, devoid of any greenery.

However, Chu Feng knew why that was the case.

There were slaughter formations all over the mountain, and there was only one right path. Those who strayed from the right path were doomed to die. How could any living being survive under such circumstances?

Chu Feng dared not to get careless. He first took out his Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk, but it didn’t provide him any guidance, so he resorted to Heaven’s Eyes. It took a while, but it gave him some idea about how he should proceed.

All of a sudden, his eyes widened and he turned around. He sensed a strong killing intent behind him. He shouted out, “Who is it?”

“Ki ki ki! Such sharp senses. You noticed me?” a sinister voice echoed as a figure stepped forward.

It was a man completely wrapped in gray robes, such that it was impossible to make out his appearance, but his wrinkled hand hinted at his old age.

“Who are you?” Chu Feng asked.

The gray-robed old man flicked his wrist and took out a token.

As soon as Chu Feng caught sight of the token, he thrust his palm forward, releasing a powerful burst of spirit power. The spirit power swiftly transformed into countless formation swords that rushed at the gray-robed old man.

Written on the gray-robed old man’s token were the words: Immortal Slaughterer.

Shoosh!

In the face of Chu Feng’s assault, the gray-robed old man waved his sleeves, and the formation swords shattered like mirror shards. He was a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, allowing him to easily neutralize Chu Feng’s attack.

Following that, his hand shot forth to grab Chu Feng, causing the surrounding space to quake.

Chu Feng couldn’t sense any martial power, but he quickly backed away as he sensed imminent danger. A huge martial power hand struck the area Chu Feng was previously standing, crushing even space itself.

It was fortunate that he had backed away, or else he would have been crushed to bits.

“You might be able to dodge it once, but how long more can you do so?” the gray-robed old man sneered as he drew an Exalted Armament saber with a flick of his wrist.

He pushed off the ground with his right foot and charged straight at Chu Feng. Halfway through, he suddenly slashed his sword in Chu Feng’s direction, unleashing a barrage of sword qi. There was very little room for Chu Feng to maneuver against such an attack at a close distance.

Even when unleashing all of his means, Chu Feng’s current martial power and spirit power only rivaled rank six Half-God level cultivator. It would have been hard for him to evade the attack of a rank seven Half-God level cultivator under normal circumstances.

Yet, Chu Feng easily dodged the attack with a simple sidestep.

The gray-robed old man froze up. Despite his face being covered up, his disbelief was palpable.

“Chu Feng, you aren’t going to escape?” Eggy asked.

“He might be a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, but he’s extremely weak. I can’t clearly sense it due to the concealment of the gray robe, but most likely, he has already used some kind of method to raise his cultivation. I reckon that this is the strongest he can get,” Chu Feng said.

“Even so, the gap between cultivation ranks is insurmountable. You can’t defeat him with your current cultivation level. It’s never too late to exact vengeance; don’t even think about resorting to the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes!” Eggy exclaimed.

Eggy would rarely speak in the midst of a fight lest she distract Chu Feng, but she was worried that Chu Feng would resort to Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes in the heat of a moment. They had already learned that Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes was an incomplete skill, and further use of it could potentially lead to his death.

“I’m fine, Eggy. He isn’t worthy of having me employ Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes. The gap between cultivation levels cannot be overcome unless one possesses heaven-defying battle power, but possessing heaven-defying battle power doesn’t mean that one has surpassed their cultivation bottleneck. That old man’s fighting prowess is at the lower end of rank seven Half-God level, whereas my fighting prowess is at the higher end of rank six Half-God level. I’d like to see today if I could defeat a rank seven Half-God as a rank six Half-God,” Chu Feng said.

The gray-robed old man summoned countless ferocious martial power beasts that rushed at Chu Feng from all directions. This was an exceptionally powerful Taboo Martial Skill. He was a sly one, pretending to be intimidated by Chu Feng while secretly preparing a powerful move.

Chu Feng found himself completely surrounded. This should have been the end of him.

However, Chu Feng was no ordinary cultivator. He had grasped Divine Flitting, a skill that allowed him to outspeed cultivators four ranks stronger than him. Even ordinary rank nine Half-God level cultivators couldn’t do anything to him, let alone the gray-robed old man.

Through Divine Flitting, Chu Feng overcame this predicament with ease. His movement was so fast that the gray-robed old man missed it. The latter only saw the martial power beasts collapsing on his target, and he was convinced that Chu Feng was a dead man.

All of a sudden, the gray-robed old man’s face darkened. A spirit power arrow was whizzing toward him at such a fast speed that it was less than two meters behind him by the time he noticed it.

Nevertheless, the gray-robed old man was a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, after all. He immediately turned around and brandished his Exalted Armament saber, accurately slicing the spirit power arrow into half.

The arrow exploded with a loud boom.

Tens of thousands of arrows suddenly manifested out of the explosion, and all of them were less than half a meter away from the gray-robed old man. As it turned out, the spirit power arrow was a formation, and the condition to trigger the formation was the arrow’s destruction.

The gray-robed old man had fallen in Chu Feng’s trap.

Boom boom boom boom boom boom!

Tens of thousands of spirit power arrows rained down on the gray-robed old man. The resulting shockwave was so huge that it stirred a huge dust storm that enveloped the surroundings.

Hu!

The shockwave suddenly vanished without a trace.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The gray-robed old man had dispelled the shockwave with a simple wave of his hand.

Chu Feng looked at the gray-robed old man and frowned. While the latter’s robe was torn from the earlier explosion, there were hardly any injuries on his body. He wasn’t even bleeding.

Despite having landed his attack squarely, the gap in their cultivation level still allowed the old man from the Immortal Slaughterer to emerge unscathed.
