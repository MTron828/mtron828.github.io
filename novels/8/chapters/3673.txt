Chapter 3673 - Chu Xuanyuan’s Death

“The City Masters of Divine Body Royal City and Monstrous Holy City are not people that can cause this old man fear.”

“However, that Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s Long Daozhi is different.”

“Do you know why even the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s Starfield Master Realm and the Linghu Heavenly Clan not dare to provoke the Three Cities?” asked Beiyang Duchuan.

“Lord Supreme Elder, why is that?” asked the All-heaven Sect’s younger generations.

“It’s because of that Long Daozhi,” said Beiyang Duchuan.

“Isn’t he a rank one Utmost Exalted like you, Milord?” asked the All-heaven Sect’s younger generations.

“Rank one Utmost Exalted?”

“He’s not as simple as you imagine him to be,” said Beiyang Duchuan.

“Grandfather, could it be that the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master is a rank two Exalted?” asked Beiyang Luo.

“His extraordinariness is most definitely not something that can be weighed by merely his cultivation,” said Beiyang Duchuan.

Hearing those words, the expressions of Nangong Yifan, Beiyang Luo and the other people of the younger generation changed. From the expressions in their eyes, one could see that they were feeling lingering fear.

Even though Beiyang Duchuan did not speak clearly, he had made them realize that Long Daozhi was a very extraordinary person.

......

“Lord Father, two seniors, what has brought you all here?”

“It is truly fortunate that you all came. Otherwise, we would have been bullied by those All-heaven Sect scoundrels today.”

Long Ning ran over to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master, hugged him, and began to voice her complaints curtly.

“Why are you asking us why we came here? We’ve been here the entire time. If we didn’t follow you all, how could you be safe?” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Ah?” Hearing those words, Long Ning, Kong Ci, Xian Yun and others revealed shocked looks. It was only at that moment that they realized that they were actually also protected whenever they left their respective cities. Furthermore, the ones secretly protecting them were actually their City Masters.

“Lord City Master, I truly never would have imagined that you’re actually this good to us.”

After realizing what had happened, the people of the younger generation were completely moved. Kong Ci and Long Ning were tightly hugging their respective fathers. Like Long Ning, Kong Ci also began to behave curtly.

“Enough, enough. Stop acting so spoiled.”

Smiling, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master pushed away the people of the younger generation that had surrounded him. Then, he walked over to Chu Feng.

“Young friend Chu Feng, there is a matter that I need to tell you. You must prepare yourself for it,” as the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master said those words, he not only had a very stern look on his face, but there was even a hint of grief in his eyes.

“Father, is it about the Linghu Heavenly Clan declaring war on the Starfield Master Realm?”

“If it’s that, we already know about it,” said Long Ning.

“No,” the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master shook his head.

“Lord City Master, may I know what it is?” asked Chu Feng. He had already guessed from the expression of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master that the matter was specifically related to him.

“The spirit formation around your Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm has disappeared. Someone entered it after it disappeared. Upon entering, that person saw two corpses. Amongst them, one was... your father’s corpse,” the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master said.

“What?”

“Ancestral Martial Lower Realm? Forbidden area? Corpses?”

Hearing those words, the people of the younger generation present, including even Lord Shoujian, were all unable to remain calm.

“Lord father, are you talking about senior Chu Xuanyuan?” asked Long Ning.

“It is confirmed to be Chu Xuanyuan,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Ah?” The crowd were all stunned upon hearing those words.

Chu Xuanyuan had died?

This was most definitely an enormous piece of news.

After a moment of shock, the people of the younger generation all turned their gazes to Chu Feng. Worry and concern filled their gazes.

Chu Xuanyuan was a legend of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. His death would be a loss for the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Even they felt some pain to a greater or lesser degree, from learning the news of Chu Xuanyuan’s death. They could only imagine what sort of pain Chu Feng was feeling.

However, when they looked at Chu Feng, they discovered that he did not have much of a pained look on his face after learning of Chu Xuanyuan’s death. Instead, he had a very stern look. It seemed like he was pondering something.

Chu Feng was indeed pondering. His father had clearly already left the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Thus, why would a corpse suddenly appear? Furthermore, the spirit formation sealing the forbidden area was very powerful, how could it suddenly disappear? Furthermore, why would there be two corpses there after it disappeared?

Two corpses... If one was his father’s corpse, who did the other corpse belong to???

“Lord City Master, in that case, does the second corpse belong to senior Old Ape?” asked Chu Feng.

“Indeed, the other corpse belonged to that old ape that had returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield together with your father,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng managed to verify one thing.

He concluded that those corpses were simply not the corpses of his father and the Old Ape. Instead, it was a facade deliberately created by his father.

As for why his father had decided to create such a facade, Chu Feng was unable to think of the reason for the time being.

“Chu Feng, when your father became renowned, he was even younger than you.”

“Although he was in the prime of youth, he was a chivalrous individual. Although he had only journeyed the Ancestral Martial Starfield for a couple years, he managed to offend a lot of people.”

“You actually have also unknowingly offended many people.”

“Regardless of whether they might be your father’s enemies or enemies you made yourself, they will not be willing to leave you alone.”

“In the past, the reason those people were afraid to touch you was because they feared your father.”

“However, as your father is no longer in this world, circumstances have changed. It has become very dangerous for you,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. Earlier, he was confused as to why his father would fake his death. However, he had now come to a total realization.

A trial. This was a trial his father had prepared for him.

It was as the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master had said. Even though Chu Feng’s father had been imprisoned, he was still renowned for his battle prowess.

Thus, the people that had witnessed his father’s might in the past still felt a deep, restraining fear of him.

In the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, Chu Feng had not only offended the Linghu Heavenly Clan, but he had also offended the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Yet, neither of them had dared to touch him. It was naturally not because they were afraid of him. Rather, it was because they were afraid of his father, Chu Xuanyuan.

However, as the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master had said, since his father had been confirmed ‘dead,’ those people would no longer fear his retaliation.

At that moment, Chu Feng was placed in a very dangerous situation.

‘Lord Father, you must’ve set this up when you left, right?’ Chu Feng sighed in his heart.

At the same time, he felt disappointed in himself.

Chu Feng knew that his father had long left. Thus, he must’ve prepared everything before leaving.

The reason why all of this only revealed itself now was because his father had managed to calculate the timing of things.

His father calculated that, at that time, Chu Feng would possess the ability to protect himself.

Thus, he had decided to do this so that Chu Feng could truly be confronted with the dangers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

However, Chu Feng knew very well that he was actually not prepared for this. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Because he did not have the capability to withstand the dangers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Chu Feng felt that he had not reached his father’s expectations, that he had let his father down.

That was the reason why he started showing a look of sadness and pain.
