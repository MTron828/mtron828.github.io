Chapter 5481: A Bunch of Cowards

“It’s good that there are no objections.”

With those words, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief began making his way toward the depths of the Martial Skill Hall. Chu Feng and the others followed him.

They entered a vast palace suffusing with spirit power.

Chu Feng quickly found that the spirit power was coming from an ordinary-looking metal gate that was a little rusty. Written in the center of the gate were the words ‘God Taboo Battlefield’. There was a text written in a smaller font beneath it:

The God Taboo Battlefield contains God Taboo Martial Skills, but they can only be obtained by the talented. Those aged above a hundred years old are forbidden from entering the premises. Those who lack courage or are weak should proceed with caution.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief took out a rusty token that shared a similar aura as the metal gate and formed a series of hand seals. The token dissipated into a whiff of smoke that fused into the metal gate.

Weng!

A surge of spirit power manifested from the center of the metal gate before spiraling outward to form a spirit formation gate.

“Enter. Remember, it’d be best if you could obtain a God Taboo Martial Skill, but otherwise, there’s no need to force it. You are the foundation of our Totem Dragon Clan. I want all of you to return safe and sound,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Chu Feng and the others stepped across the spirit formation gate.

The shocking scenery that laid bare before them right after they stepped across the gate left many feeling queasy. It was a battlefield filled with mountains of carcasses and rivers of blood.

The crowd was standing in a pool of crimson blood that reached up to their thighs. Countless carcasses were floating in this pool. They could even spot mountain-like bodies in the distance. The overpowering blood stench penetrated the cultivators’ barriers and assaulted their senses.

But what truly terrified the crowd was the pressure coming from the land itself. This land was suffused with a peculiar energy that robbed them of their ability to fly, meaning that they were unable to escape from the pool of blood.

It felt as if they had descended into hell.

“What kind of blasted place is this? Why would the God Taboo Battlefield turn into something like this?”

None of the Totem Dragon Clan’s juniors had ever encountered anything like this. Many of them revealed looks of fear, and some of their eyes even reddened.

No more than ten people among the ten thousand juniors were able to maintain their composure.

“What are you panicking for? It’s an illusion. Head forward. The true entrance is there,” Long Chengyu said.

He had the disposition of a leader, which compelled others to listen to him. Right after he said those words, the crowd quickly calmed down, bucked up their courage, and followed him.

The crowd walked for a period of time when they suddenly sensed something rippling beneath their feet. Following that, they saw a blood-red light ahead of them gushing into the sky.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The crowd immediately halted their footsteps, not daring to advance further. They watched as the blood billowed, and five gates rose from the ground.

The crowd heaved a sigh of relief. While the God Taboo Battlefield was different from how they remembered it, the appearance of these five gates tallied with what the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had told them.

These gates opened up one after another, starting from the leftmost gate, revealing dark corridors within them.

“Follow the groupings assigned by Lord Clan Chief,” Long Chengyu ordered before heading to the first gate.

Long Muxi made her way to the second gate. Long Yuhong headed to the third gate. Long Fengfeng marched to the fourth gate.

Long Fengfeng had stood at the forefront of the juniors earlier too, the one whom Chu Feng suspected to be the grand elder’s granddaughter. She had a younger brother named Long Chenglu, and he was assigned to the same team as well.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng made his way toward the fifth gate.

While he was walking over, Long Zhizhi suddenly said, “Hey, Chu Feng. What did you feed the clan chief for him to regard you so highly?”

Chu Feng halted his footsteps and looked over. “Why are you asking me that? The clan chief was just right there earlier. Are you afraid to ask him yourself?”

Long Zhizhi’s face turned dark. She had indeed dared not speak up against the clan chief. Even Long Chengyu intimidated her too, which was why she only confronted Chu Feng after they had parted ways.

“Chu Feng, I don’t know what you did to the clan chief, but you shouldn’t even dream that we would listen to an outsider like you. You aren’t worthy!” Long Zhizhi sneered.

The other juniors burst into laughter to mock Chu Feng, but the latter wasn’t affected by their taunts at all.

“Frankly speaking, I don’t want to lead any of you either. Your life and death have nothing to do with me. But since the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief has entrusted this position to me, I have no choice but to interfere. I suggest you don’t cause me any trouble,” Chu Feng warned.

“So what if I cause you trouble? Who do you think you are? You are nothing but a countryside bumpkin from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy!” Long Zhizhi sneered.

Boom!

Chu Feng suddenly released a powerful burst of aura.

Before the crowd could react, Chu Feng had already grabbed Long Zhizhi’s throat and pushed her against the wall. He was currently emanating an aura of a Purple God-cloak World Spiritist, but somehow, the pressure he gave off was comparable to that of a rank five Half-God level cultivator.

“Long Zhizhi, I know that you aren’t happy with the situation. Go ahead and take my position if you want to… but only if you can defeat me. Do you think you have the strength to do that?” Chu Feng eyed Long Zhizhi with utterly cold eyes.

Long Zhizhi was initially infuriated, but she found herself unable to flare up when she was faced with Chu Feng’s eyes up close. His gaze was so ferocious that she didn’t even dare to look into it. It was only now that she realized that Chu Feng was not a pushover.

“You bastard! How dare you touch Miss Zhizhi? You’re courting death!”

Many juniors from the Totem Dragon Clan rushed forward to save Long Zhizhi. Knowing that their cultivation was no match for Chu Feng, they released their bloodline powers, but even so, the strongest of them had only barely reached rank four Half-God level.

Chu Feng didn’t bother to even respond to their attacks. All it took was a mere wave of spirit power to send them flying into the walls like sandbags. Those who were luckier got off with just a light concussion, whereas those who were unlucky fainted on the spot.

“You!!!”

The juniors were horrified. They hadn’t thought that Chu Feng would dare to make a move on them.

“Anyone else who wants to challenge me?”

Chu Feng’s earlier strike had intimidated most of the juniors present, but a beautiful woman still stepped forward to confront him.

“How dare you touch our Totem Dragon Clansmen, Chu Feng? You’re dead meat. I’ll have your entire clan extermined for this. I’ll torture every single person you care about so as to let it sink into your thick skull the price of daring to touch our clansmen!”

The woman pointed her finger at Chu Feng as she spoke with a proud tone. She wasn’t just joking about it; she intended to carry it out too.

Chu Feng instantaneously flitted up to her and sunk a punch into her abdomen.

Gwah!

The punch didn’t send her flying, but the woman’s knees caved in as her hands flew upward to clutch her stomach. She kneeled before Chu Feng with a trembling body, unable to speak a word at all. Blood seeped out of her mouth.

“Anyone else wants to give it a try?” Chu Feng asked.

All of the juniors clamped their mouths shut. Fear could be seen on their faces. Even the most arrogant of them dared not to face him anymore.

Chu Feng wasn’t surprised by the situation at all. He had encountered far too many of such situations. These so-called prodigies often act high and mighty before those weaker than them, but as soon as they encounter someone stronger than them who didn’t fear their background, they would cower like a bunch of cowards.
