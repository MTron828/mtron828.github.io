Chapter 2889 - I Alone Am Sufficient

“Am I seeing things? He really managed to luck out?”

“A random spirit formation that he set up actually ended up being the correct unsealing formation?”

“What sort of enormous dog shit luck did he encounter?!!”

At this moment when the crowd were astonished, Asura Zhao Kun let out a mocking cry of alarm.

He clung to his view that Chu Feng was gambling with luck and managed to luck out, that Chu Feng had simply had not relied on his own strength to win.

Once Asura Zhao Kun’s words were said, the crowd also began to echo their agreement.

“That’s right, it’s impossible for Chu Feng to suddenly become this powerful. If he were this powerful, how could he have been defeated so miserably earlier?”

“This is most definitely a coincidence. However, even if it’s a coincidence, he’s simply too lucky.”

The crowd was unable to contain the astonishment they felt.

“You actually managed to luck out?”

Liangqiu Hongyue said to Chu Feng.

It would appear that it was not only the bystanders that felt Chu Feng had relied on luck; even Liangqiu Hongyue felt this way too.

Even she did not believe that Chu Feng had won against her using his own strength.

“Whether it’s luck or not, you’ll soon find out.”

Chu Feng was not angry at Liangqiu Hongyue’s mockery. He continued to have a smile on his face the entire time.

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng turned to Xia Yun’er and the others, “You all can go in and train first. By the time you all leave, the seventh, eighth and ninth Inheritance Sites will all be open for you all to train in.”

Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd was astonished.

It was not that the crowd was overreacting. Rather, Chu Feng’s words were simply too shocking.

By the time they left, all of the Inheritance Sites would be open for them to train in? Wouldn’t this mean that Chu Feng would be able to unlock all of the remaining Inheritance Sites very quickly?

Arrogance, this was an enormous level of arrogance, an enormous level of confidence.

Chu Feng simply did not place Liangqiu Hongyue in his eyes at all. He was acting as if he was already certain of his victory.

"You, who gave you your confidence?!" Liangqiu Hongyue asked in a very displeased manner.

"Something like confidence is naturally given by oneself," Chu Feng replied with a smile.

"Come, let’s continue. I refuse to believe that you will win against me."

Liangqiu Hongyue was so furious that she began to stamp her feet repeatedly. Then, she turned around and began walking toward the seventh Inheritance Site.

As for Chu Feng, he followed after her.

"Chu Feng, just decipher the Inheritance Sites at your convenience. We will enter them together to train with you after you’ve finished," Xia Yun’er said at that moment.

"That’s right. Brother Chu Feng, we will wait for you," even the two Starfall Holy Land’s male disciples voiced their desire to stay.

Seeing this, Asura Zhao Kun’s expression turned very ugly. However, he did not say anything.

After all, the Nine Profound Sect’s disciples were all waiting for the Liangqiu sisters. Thus, it was only within reason for Xia Yun’er and the others to wait for Chu Feng.

"In that case, I will have to trouble everyone with waiting," Chu Feng clasped his fist at Xia Yun’er and the others.

Then, Chu Feng and Liangqiu Hongyue began to decipher the seventh Inheritance Site at the same time.

Chu Feng’s behavior this time around was practically the same as last time. He only examined the seventh Inheritance Site for a short moment before starting to set up his unsealing formation.

"This guy, could it be that he’s still planning to gamble with luck?"

Witnessing this scene, many people felt that Chu Feng had gone insane. Gambling with luck was something that might work once. However, it would definitely be impossible for it to work a second time.

However, while all this was happening, Xia Yun’er and Liangqiu Lanyue’s expressions had turned serious.

They suddenly thought of a frightening matter. That is, Chu Feng wasn’t gambling with luck, but rather really possessed that sort of strength.

That being said, they would have to wait for the result of his spirit formation to determine whether or not he possessed actual strength or was relying on luck.

Before the focus of the crowd, Chu Feng’s unsealing formation was completed.

His unsealing formation was activated, and brilliant light started shining from it. In a very natural and flowing manner, his unsealing formation assimilated into the seventh Inheritance Site.

Following that, a ’snap,’ was heard, and the entrance of the seventh Inheritance Site opened before the crowd’s attentive gazes.

"This..."

The astonishment on the crowd’s faces was even more intense than the last time.

After all, while the first time might be luck, the second time would be actual strength.

"That Chu Feng wasn’t actually relying on luck? Rather, he really managed to decipher and unlock the Inheritance Site in such a short period of time? But, in that case, why would he lose so miserably earlier? Could he have done so on purpose? Did he deliberately lose to Liangqiu Hongyue?"

"He deliberately allowed Liangqiu Hongyue to win four times in a row so that he could unlock the next four Inheritance Sites in succession to defeat her at once?"

When thinking of this, the people of the younger generation felt even more astonished.

If that was really the case, then Chu Feng would be truly too frightening.

One must know that Liangqiu Hongyue was Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciple.

Chu Feng was actually able to toy around with Grandmaster Liangqiu’s disciple. This was truly too astonishing of a feat.

Outside the Inheritance Site, Elder Xingyi was unable to contain himself. He said, "It would appear that Chu Feng was not impatient. Rather, he was devising battle strategies."

When he said those words, he deliberately took a glance at that Nine Profound Sect’s elder who had spoken ill of Chu Feng earlier. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Hearing those words, that Nine Profound Sect’s elder’s aged face turned red. Even though he was feeling unreconciled in his heart, he had no choice but to admit that he had indeed made an error in judgement this time around. That brat by the name of Chu Feng was even more powerful than he had anticipated.

"Brother Zhao, what do you think of this? Could it be that Chu Feng was truly deliberately going easy on Grandmaster Liangqiu’s two disciples?" An elder from the Starfall Holy Land turned to ask Zhao Kuangfengyi.

"I am uncertain too. However, there is one thing that I am certain of. Chu Feng has managed to unlock the Inheritance Sites not by luck, but rather with actual strength," Zhao Kuangfengyi said.

Once he said those words, even the expert martial cultivators revealed an extra serious expression on their faces. When they looked to Chu Feng again, their gazes had completely changed.

"Continue!"

Suddenly, a shout was heard. It was Liangqiu Hongyue.

Liangqiu Hongyue was feeling even more unreconciled. She refused to believe that she had won earlier because Chu Feng had deliberately gone easy on her.

She also did not believe that Chu Feng really possessed such powerful strength, and was capable of being so much faster than her at deciphering and unlocking the Inheritance Sites.

Coincidence. She felt that all of this was merely a coincidence.

Chu Feng just so happened to be more proficient in those specific Inheritance Sites’ unsealing formations.

That said, to be proficient with the unsealing formation for the two Inheritance Sites in succession would be some enormous luck. She felt that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to be proficient in the unsealing formation for the next two Inheritance Sites.

Under such circumstances, Chu Feng and Liangqiu Hongyue immediately began to decipher the eighth Inheritance Site.

However, what happened with the eighth Inheritance Site was practically a duplicate of the previous two.

Chu Feng immediately started setting up his spirit formation right after examining the Inheritance Site for a short moment. Furthermore, he succeeded in unlocking the eighth Inheritance Site with a single attempt.

So far, Liangqiu Hongyue had unlocked the second, third, fourth and fifth Inheritance Sites.

Chu Feng, on the other hand, had unlocked the first, sixth, seventh and eighth Inheritance Sites.

The two of them were tied.

The ninth Inheritance Site would be the key to determine who among them would be the victor.

Merely, at that moment, Liangqiu Hongyue was panicking. After being defeated by Chu Feng three times in succession, she no longer possessed any confidence.

She suddenly realized that she might really be inferior to Chu Feng.

Thus, she no longer dared to say the word ‘continue’ again.

She was afraid of losing. If she were to lose, she would not only be bringing humiliation to herself, but she would’ve also stained her master’s reputation.

In fact, it was not only Liangqiu Hongyue that was panicking right now. The Nine Profound Sect’s disciples were also panicking.

However, the person that was panicking the most was actually someone from the Starfall Holy Land’s camp. That person was Asura Zhao Kun.

If Chu Feng were to really unlock the ninth Inheritance Site and defeat Liangqiu Hongyue, what would he do about the oath that he had made earlier?

Could it be that he would really have to change his name to Coward Zhao Kun?

When thinking of that, Asura Zhao Kun simply did not dare to continue to think. It was simply a nightmare.

“Chu Feng, I will replace Liangqiu Hongyue to compete with you.”

Right at that moment, a voice sounded. It was Liangqiu Lanyue.

As the older sister, she was able to tell that her younger sister was panicking. In this sort of situation, her younger sister would not be able to continue with the match against Chu Feng.

However, the disciples of Grandmaster Liangqiu could not be defeated. As such, she must shoulder the final match.

“You sisters are truly interesting. The two of you first started out together. Then, it became the younger sister alone. When the younger sister is no longer capable, the older sister comes to take her place.”

“This must be the rumored wheel tactic, right? Using such a tactic, even if you sisters are to win, you will likely be said to have an unfair advantage, no?”

Right at that moment, Xia Yun’er suddenly spoke.

She was unable to tolerate the shameless actions of the Liangqiu sisters.

After Xia Yun’er spoke out against it, the Liangqiu sisters silently lowered their heads. They did not answer her.

They themselves also knew that what they wanted to do was very unfair. However, there was no other option. Even if it must be done through an unfair advantage, they still could not afford to lose.

“Miss Xia, what you’ve said is incorrect,” right at that moment, a disciple from the Nine Profound Sect stood forth. He said, “The Liangqiu sisters specialize in deciphering and unsealing formations together. Earlier, Liangqiu Lanyue’s action of withdrawing herself from the battle to allow Liangqiu Hongyue to compete against Chu Feng alone could only be said to be going easy on Chu Feng.”

“If you feel that this is unfair, your Starfall Holy Land’s disciple and that Asura World Spiritist could very well join the competition too. If you all are to win, we will absolutely not say that you all had an unfair advantage.”

The Liangqiu sisters were, after all, distinguished guests invited by them. As such, they could not tolerate Xia Yun’er disrespecting the Liangqiu sisters.

Moreover, the ninth Inheritance Site was no ordinary Inheritance Site. It was the Legacy Inheritance. They would naturally hope for the Liangqiu sisters to be able to unlock it.

Should that happen, they would be able to enter that Inheritance Site.

As this was a matter of absolute self-interest, even if they were fond of Xia Yun’er, they still absolutely could not give in to her.

“You are all simply spouting sophistry,” Xia Yun’er narrowed her long, shapely eyebrows and spoke with a very annoyed tone.

“Unfortunately, this is something that the rules permit,” that Nine Profound Sect’s disciple spread open his arms. He seemed to be saying ‘what can you possibly do about it?’

“You!!!” Faced with such atrocious behavior, Xia Yun’er’s little face turned deep red with anger.

“Miss Xia, you don’t have to quarrel with them,” right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke. Then, he looked to the NIne Profound Sect’s disciples and the Liangqiu sisters, “Since it is allowed by the rules, we naturally cannot refuse you all to jointly decipher the Inheritance Site.”

“I also know how important this ninth Inheritance Site is to the Nine Profound Sect. You all will definitely not want to miss out on this opportunity.”

“Thus, I think the five of you might as well act together. Rest assured, if you all are able to unlock the ninth Inheritance Site, it will be considered your win. No one will say that you all had an unfair advantage.”

“However, as for us, there is no need for us to all set out to confront you all.”

“The reason for that is because I, Chu Feng, alone will be sufficient to handle you all.”
