Chapter 3847 - The Power Of Treasures

Upon closer inspection, the light was composed of symbols and runes. The complicated symbols and runes had condensed into a suit of armor.

Seeing the armor, Chu Feng’s brows narrowed.

The armor contained a strange power. Even Chu Feng was unable to tell what sort of power that was. However, Chu Feng felt danger from it.

Furthermore, it should be worth mentioning that the strange armor of symbols and runes had not only appeared on the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

Instead, such armor had appeared on all eleven of the Mystic Cave Saints.

Soon, the symbols on the armor started to spin rapidly. With that, they began to shine much brighter. The light emitted by the armor soared straight into the sky.

Not even Chu Feng’s spirit power was able to stop it.

Eleven pillars of light soared into the sky at the same time and turned into an enormou net filled with symbols and runes that covered the sky.

At the same time, a strange aura descended from the sky.

“This sensation?”

At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart grew tense.

When that aura landed on him, Chu Feng felt as if his power was being restricted.

His powerful spirit power instantly grew much weaker.

However, it seemed like he was the only one who was affected by it. The others present were all unaffected.

Upon closer inspection, Chu Feng discovered that a layer of symbols and runes had appeared on his body.

The symbols and runes were exactly the same as the ones on the armor worn by the Mystic Cave Saints.

Merely, those symbols and runes were extremely small. If Chu Feng didn’t use special methods, he would not even have detected them.

At that moment, Chu Feng was certain that even though the spirit formation of symbols and runes in the sky appeared very imposing and vast, it was only targeting him.

This was an ability the Mystic Cave Saints had used solely for him.

However, it did not resemble an ordinary spirit formation. Rather, it seemed more like some sort of treasure.

At the very least, it was not a spirit formation that the Mystic Cave Saints had set up.

“How was it? Little brat, you should’ve sensed it, no?” the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints asked with a beaming smile.

“What is this?” asked Chu Feng.

“This is called the Binding Armor Formation. It is capable of assimilating with one’s opponent.”

“For example, since your spirit power surpasses us brothers, the Binding Armor Formation will make your spirit power identical to us brothers.”

“Of course, this Binding Armor Formation was originally prepared for that boy Yuan Shu.”

“It could be said that we’re giving you face by using it on you.” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng finally understood why the Mystic Cave Saints were willing to accept this gamble knowing full well that the Red-dress Holy Land would attempt to request the assistance of Grandmaster Yuan Shu.

As it turned out, they were already prepared.

According to them, with their Binding Armor Formation, even if Yuan Shu was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he would still be suppressed by the Binding Armor Formation.

The Binding Armor Formation would suppress Yuan Shu’s spirit power to be at the same level as theirs.

It would make Yuan Shu’s superiority disappear.

“Damn it! Those Mystic Cave Saints actually possess such a treasure?!”

“To suppress one’s opponent’s strength with a treasure because one’s own strength is insufficient, this is simply too despicable!”

The people from the Red-dress Holy Land all lashed out at the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Clamor~~~”

Right at that moment, the grand protective formation around the Mystic Cave Saints suddenly shattered.

The Mystic Cave Saints all emerged from their previous hideout.

They were the ones that had removed the grand protective formation.

After Chu Feng’s spirit power was suppressed, they were planning to stop defending, and unleash their attack at him.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Right after they left their grand protective formation, the giant ferocious beasts Chu Feng had created earlier immediately rushed towards them.

Seeing the incoming ferocious beasts, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints unleashed his spirit power.

His spirit power turned into flames that revolved around them. Although it was also a defensive formation, it was extremely powerful.

Chu Feng’s enormous ferocious beasts were akin to moths flying into the flame.

They immediately let out roars and were destroyed upon entering the flames.

Chu Feng’s ferocious attack that the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to ward off even when defending with all their might earlier was now easily warded off.

Earlier, Chu Feng had held absolute superiority. However, he had now fallen into a complete disadvantage.

“How could this be? According to them, that so-called Binding Armor Formation will be able to suppress young master Asura’s spirit power. However, their spirit power should be identical.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Why would young master Asura’s spirit power weaken this much, whereas the Mystic Cave Saints’ spirit power did not weaken, but has instead strengthened?”

The Red-dress Holy Land’s elders were all discussing spiritedly.

At the moment when the crowd were confused, the Red-dress Holy Land’s headmaster said, “It’s the treasure in their hand.”

Once she said those words, the elders all noticed that the Mystic Cave Saints’ Eldest was holding a horsetail whisk in his hand.

The horsetail whisk was very small, much smaller than an ordinary horsetail whisk. It also did not appear to be special at all. It was so unremarkable that they’d nearly failed to notice it.

The spirit power that was suppressing Chu Feng did not come from the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. Instead, it was coming from that horsetail whisk.

“It would appear that that horsetail whisk is capable of strengthening your spirit power?” asked Chu Feng.

“You’ve guessed correctly. This horsetail whisk of mine is something I obtained from an Ancient Era’s remnant. It is a treasure from the Ancient Era.”

“It is also something we prepared for Yuan Shu.”

“As you can see, my Binding Armor Formation is capable of suppressing your power.”

“But, at the same time, our own spirit power is also suppressed by it.”

“Our spirit power is suppressed to a level identical to yours.”

“Under this sort of circumstance, it would be impossible to determine a victor. At the very most, we’d reach a tie.”

“However, it’s different with this horsetail whisk in hand. This horsetail whisk is unaffected by the power of the Binding Armor Formation, and can strengthen my spirit power.”

“With it in hand, you are destined to lose.”

“Brat, do you know now why your daddy was so confident in being able to defeat you?”

The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints fiddled with his horsetail whisk. He was extremely pleased with himself.
