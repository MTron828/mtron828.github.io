Chapter 3499 - Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation

Linghu Yuhua felt very surprised. After all, the matter of the Linghu Heavenly Clan seeking out Chu Xuanyuan was a secret. Very few people in the entire Linghu Heavenly Clan knew about that matter.

Thus, she asked, “Hongfei, who told you those things? Could it be Lord Clan Chief?”

As Linghu Hongfei’s guardian, Linghu Yuhua had been protecting him from the shadows the entire time. Thus, she knew all about the people and things that he had encountered.

However, when Linghu Hongfei came in contact with a specific individual, even she would have to withdraw.

As for that person, it was their Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Actually, their Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had also arrived at the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.

Furthermore, he had personally seen Linghu Hongfei before the selection began.

Thus, she suspected that it was most likely their Lord Clan Chief that had told Linghu Hongfei those things.

“It was indeed Lord Clan Chief who told me,” Linghu Hongfei nodded. Then, he added, “That said, I believe that it must actually be because of you senior, that Lord Clan Chief specifically mentioned this matter to me.”

“Senior, you must’ve mentioned the grudges between Chu Feng and I to Lord Clan Chief. Likely, Lord Clan Chief mentioned this matter to me because he didn’t want me to kill Chu Feng,” Linghu Hongfei said.

Linghu Yuhua did not give an answer. However, she had silently acknowledged his guess. Indeed, she was the one who had told their Lord Clan Chief about the conflict that occurred between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei.

That was part of her obligation. Not only was she tasked with protecting Linghu Hongfei, but she would also have to report everything he experienced to their Lord Clan Chief.

“Thus, senior, as long as that Chu Xuanyuan remains alive, I truly cannot kill that Chu Feng, isn’t that right?” Linghu Hongfei asked.

“Hongfei, since Lord Clan Chief has already mentioned it to you, you should understand that in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, apart from the Starfield Master Realm, only Chu Xuanyuan poses a threat to our Linghu Heavenly Clan.”

“Based on his personality, the chance that he will ally with us against the Starfield Master Realm is extremely slim. However, we also cannot touch his reverse scale.”

“Otherwise, not to mention starting a war against the Starfield Master Realm, a single Chu Xuanyuan would serve as an enormous headache for our clan,” said Linghu Yuhua.

“I understand,” Linghu Hongfei nodded. Then, he said, “Senior, I want to enter the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation.”

“Hongfei, you must not let yourself be affected by your emotions. With your talent, even if you do not enter the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation, you’ll still be able to make steady progress in your cultivation. There’s no need for you to take such a risk,” said Linghu Yuhua.

“If I don’t take such a risk, how am I supposed to handle that Chu Feng once he summons an even more powerful world spirit?” asked Linghu Hongfei.

Linghu Yuhua was left stunned. She did not know how to respond.

Although Chu Feng was not as powerful as Chu Xuanyuan from back then, his performance had caused her to have a whole new level of respect for him.

Even if Chu Feng could not compare to his father from back then, he was sufficiently dazzling amongst the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s current younger generations.

What Linghu Hongfei was worried about was not something that couldn’t happen.

After all, demon-level geniuses were unreasonable people capable of accomplishing the impossible.

“Senior, you should know that what I, Linghu Hongfei, want to become is not one of the strongest, but rather the strongest.”

“Besides, Exalted Heavenly Fate had already prophesied that Chu Feng and I are destined to battle one another. While I can spare his life, I cannot allow myself to lose to him.”

“This is my fate. I can either live like a dog or take on the challenge from him,” Linghu Hongfei said.

Linghu Yuhua felt very pained. She had accompanied Linghu Hongfei since his childhood. Very few people knew him as well as her.

She knew that he was a very obsessive and competitive person.

It was due to his obsession to become the strongest and his competitiveness in not being defeated by anyone that he would try to win by fair means or foul. It was due to his obsession and competitiveness that he became a hypocrite. Yet, at the same time, it caused him to work extremely hard, frantically hard even.

While Linghu Hongfei’s demon-level talent was definitely indispensable in his being able to gain his current level of cultivation and techniques, the hard work that he had put forth was also not something that ordinary people could match up to.

At the very least, of all the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, not a single person worked as hard as Linghu Hongfei.

“Since you’ve made your decision, you should discuss it with Lord Clan Chief,” Linghu Yuhua knew very well that she could not change his mind.

If anyone could change his mind, it was only one person -- their Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Lord Clan Chief.

“Lord Clan Chief has already agreed to it,” said Linghu Hongfei.

Linghu Yuhua immediately revealed a look of surprise upon hearing those words.

However, she soon felt relief. After a short moment of being shocked, she had come to a realization, and was able to make a guess as to what was happening.

“Senior, you should know better than me that our clan actually already possesses the strength to wage war against the Starfield Master Realm. Originally, we were planning to wage war against the Starfield Master Realm in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. The reason for our delay was because Lord Clan Chief was waiting for me,” said Linghu Hongfei.

“Sure enough,” Linghu Yuhua had guessed correctly.

Sure enough, the reason why their Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had postponed the war that they were already prepared for was to wait for Linghu Hongfei.

Why were they waiting for Linghu Hongfei? It was because he was their Linghu Heavenly Clan’s future. He was the person held with the greatest importance in their Linghu Heavenly Clan.

But, why would they decide to wait for him at such an important time?

It was because he was about to enter the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation.

The Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation was an ancient and powerful formation originating from the Ancient Era.

No one knew who had created the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation. In fact, at a glance, it looked more like a place formed by nature. There was no trace of it being modified by anyone.

Yet, it was of enormous assistance to people that possessed Heavenly Bloodlines.

Although the Linghu Heavenly Clan were very strong to begin with, their clan would likely only be one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans and not the strongest among them had it not been for their ancestor finding and seizing the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation for their clansmen to use to train with.

From this, one could imagine how powerful the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation was.

That said, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen would generally only train right outside the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation. The reason for that was not merely because the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation’s interior was sealed, making it impossible for them to enter it to train, but most importantly, it was because the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation would only open once every millennium.

When the power outside the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation was already sufficient to allow the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen to become so strong, one could well imagine how strong the power inside of it was.

Unfortunately, the power inside the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation was extremely berserk in nature. Ordinary people were simply incapable of enduring the power inside.

Over the ten thousand years since the Linghu Heavenly Clan had discovered and occupied it, countless of their clansmen had entered it. However, only a single person was able to leave it alive.

As for that person, it was their current Lord Clan Chief.

It was precisely because he had been tempered inside the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation that the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was deemed to be the only man in the current Ancestral Martial Starfield truly capable of contending against the Starfield Master Realm.

In terms of talent, although the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was also a genius, he was not the most talented amongst his peers. Compared to Linghu Hongfei’s talent, the disparity between them would be enormous.

Should he have been allowed to progress normally, the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief might become one of their clan’s experts. However, it would definitely be impossible for him to become the strongest amongst the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The reason why he was able to gain his current success was all due to the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation.

This was the reason why the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation was so powerful. It was capable of truly transforming a person.

If Linghu Hongfei was able to exit the formation alive, the accomplishments he would be able to attain in the future would be beyond measure.

Furthermore, it just so happened that the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation would have its once-in-a-millennium opening, the exceptional opportunity, in the upcoming days!!!
