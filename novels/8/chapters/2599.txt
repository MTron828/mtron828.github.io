Chapter 2599 - Breaking Through The Formation With One’s Body

“Senior, could it be that that illusion is there to deliberately affect me?” Chu Feng felt very shocked.

“That’s right, it is there to deliberately affect you. If you are to attempt to break through this formation with what you’ve comprehended from that illusion, you will definitely die,” Ying Mingchao spoke in a very certain manner.

“But, if this Unknown Burial Ground does not plan to allow me to pass through the Life and Death Formation, it could totally make it into a death trap. Is there really a need for it to do all that?” Chu Feng asked.

He was truly confused. He felt that this simply doesn’t make sense.

“Chu Feng, it’s me, Zi Xunyi,” Right at this moment, Zi Xunyi’s voice sounded.

“Senior Zi, you also came?” Chu Feng was pleasantly surprised upon hearing Zi Xunyi’s voice.

Chu Feng had witnessed what had happened back then. He had thought that he would never see Zi Xunyi again. Never did he expect that he would hear her voice so soon.

“After hearing that you were trapped here, Xunyi immediately rushed over to help. Else... likely not even the gods would have been able to move her,” Ying Mingchao explained.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt even greater warmth in his heart. After all, that indirectly revealed that Zi Xunyi cared deeply about his safety.

Friendship between people was like this...

If one were to encounter someone that they got along well with, one would not need to know the other for long in order to go through water and tread on fire for the other.

However, if one were to encounter someone fake, then regardless of how good the mutual relationship between the two might be, that person would not do anything when you were in a crisis.

As for Zi Xunyi, she was evidently the former type.

“Chu Feng, hear me out. Do not be discouraged and do not be scared. The reason for that is because there have been survivors among the people that have entered the Unknown Burial Ground,” Zi Xunyi said.

“Someone managed to successfully pass through the Unknown Burial Ground’s three checkpoints?” Chu Feng revealed a joyous expression after hearing what Zi Xunyi said.

The reason why Chu Feng felt this joyous was because what Zi Xunyi said meant that the Unknown Burial Ground was not a death trap. Instead, one could really pass through it.

At the same time, Chu Feng also felt admiration from the bottom of his heart toward that survivor.

Being inside the Unknown Burial Ground, Chu Feng knew very well how dangerous the Unknown Burial Ground was. He even felt that he only had a thirty percent chance of being able to pass through this Life and Death Formation.

As such, the person who managed to safely pass through the Life and Death Formation would naturally be qualified to receive Chu Feng’s admiration.

“Indeed, there have been people that managed to pass through the Unknown Burial Ground’s three checkpoints. As for those people, they are Xunyi and myself,” Ying Mingchao said.

“It’s seniors?” Chu Feng felt even more joyous upon hearing those words. If they had managed to pass through the Unknown Burial Ground, they most definitely knew how to pass through this Life and Death Formation.

It seemed that there was some promise in Chu Feng being able to pass through this Unknown Burial Ground.

“Back then, the two of us only managed to pass through this Unknown Burial Ground by accident. However, if you are to do as we did, you will definitely be able to return alive. Merely, our method was a bit extreme. You will have to end up suffering in the process.”

“As for that suffering, it is quite unendurable. However, as long as you endure it, you will be able to pass through the Life and Death Formation.”

“Thus... you must make mental preparations,” Ying Mingchao said.

“It’s alright. As long as I can quickly pass through this Life and Death Formation, I am not afraid of any suffering,” Chu Feng said.

Actually, he was this impatient not because he wanted to quickly leave the Unknown Burial Ground.

Rather, it was because he was worried for Zhao Hong.

One must know that Zhao Hong had been in the Life and Death Formation for much longer than him. Right now, her life and death was undetermined. As such, how could Chu Feng not worry?

Thus, it was a race against time for Chu Feng right now. He must quickly break through this Life and Death Formation.

“Very well, in that case, let’s begin.”

Then, Ying Mingchao began to give directions on how to pass through the Life and Death Formation to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng did not hesitate in the slightest. He began to crash through the Life and Death Formation as per Ying Mingchao’s instructions.

As Ying Mingchao stated, after Chu Feng started moving according to Ying Mingchao’s instructions, he began to encounter countless torments.

The reason for that was because Ying Mingchao’s method was truly extreme. Whenever Chu Feng was to encounter slaughtering formations or traps, he would not try to find a way to break through them. Instead, he would directly pass through them. He would use his body to endure the countless attacks from the slaughtering formations.

Furthermore, the injuries brought forth by the slaughtering formations in this Life and Death Formation could not be healed.

As Chu Feng continued onward, his body once again became badly mangled. He was trembling. Each and every step onward became incomparably difficult.

In this sort of situation, even the crowd that had seen countless slaughters and corpses was unable to steel themselves to continue watching this.

The scene before them was simply too cruel. Chu Feng was crashing through the various obstacles with his life.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

At this very moment, a sword formation filled the sky. Like a torrential rain, the swords were dancing about with blustering noises in the ravine.

The countless light swords were only attacking a single target, the person that was proceeding onward through the ravine, Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was like a loose leaf in a violent windstorm as he was knocked left and right by the swords that filled the sky.

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng did not cower. Dragging his battered body, he continued onward with great difficulty.

“This sort of method to break through a formation is simply too cruel. This is simply using one’s body to forcibly withstand all of the attacks.”

Seeing Chu Feng’s current situation, Kong Yuehua started to waver. She was no longer certain as to whether or not such a method would work.

“Since it’s a trial, the most important aspect is to accept the trial. As to how to do so, that is not important.”

“Since this method is something that Ying Mingchao obtained through his own experience, it is most definitely effective,” Kong Shunlian said.

“But, that grand formation is simply too powerful. Will Chu Feng really be able to endure it if he is to continue to force his way through like this?” Kong Yuehua said worriedly.

“That is something that you do not have to worry about. Although Chu Feng is a Martial Ancestor, he is the strongest Martial Ancestor. Likely, the Ying Mingchao from back then was not be as strong as the current Chu Feng. Since Ying Mingchao was able to pass through it, Chu Feng will most definitely be able to do so too,” Compared to Kong Yuehua, Kong Shunlian was filled with confidence toward Chu Feng.

In fact, although Chu Feng’s situation was extremely devastating, the great majority of the people present felt the same way as Kong Shunlian.

They felt that Chu Feng would definitely be able to pass through the Life and Death Formation and walk out of the Unknown Burial Ground alive as long as he persisted.

Ying Mingchao was also extremely confident in Chu Feng. Even though Chu Feng was already on the verge of collapse, Ying Mingchao’s expression was growing more and more emotional, more and more excited.

“Almost, he’s almost there.”

“Chu Feng, hold on a bit longer, a bit longer and you’ll be able to leave this formation,” Ying Mingchao spoke very excitedly.

Hearing those words, the crowd also became extremely excited.

They all felt that Chu Feng would soon pass through the Unknown Burial Ground. As for them, they would be able to witness that scene.

Not to mention the others, it was true for even Chu Feng. Upon hearing what Ying Mingchao said, a greater amount of strength emerged from his body. His originally slow-moving pace accelerated greatly.

Most shockingly, Chu Feng actually managed to force his way through this sword formation that seemed to be impossible for one to force one’s way through.

At this moment, Chu Feng had arrived at an open land. A cliff was before him.

That cliff stood perfectly straight. It appeared as if it was leading directly to the sky.

This cliff blocked Chu Feng’s path forward.

“Senior, what must I do now?” Chu Feng asked.

However, Chu Feng did not receive an answer from Ying Mingchao.

“Senior?”

“Senior Ying Mingchao?”

Chu Feng continued to call for Ying Mingchao. Yet, he still did not receive a response.

“What is going on?”

“Could it be that some sort of problem has appeared in the spirit formation that they used to communicate with me?” Seeing that Ying Mingchao did not respond, Chu Feng started to worry.

Actually, nothing had happened to the spirit formation that Ying Mingchao was using to communicate with Chu Feng.

Everyone was able to clearly see the situation that Chu Feng was in.

Merely, both Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi had turned pale. They no longer possessed the joyous expressions that they did before.

“How could this be? Logically, Chu Feng should have passed through the Life and Death Formation. But.... why is he still in the Life and Death Formation?” Confused, Ying Mingchao looked to Zi Xunyi.

“Chu Feng took the exact same steps as we did. There was no mistake at all. Something like this shouldn’t be happening,” Zi Xunyi also had a confused expression.

“What is going on? Could it be... that it ended in a failure?”

The conversation between Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi was not done through voice transmissions. Thus, they were heard by everyone present.

This included even Chu Feng, who was inside the Unknown Burial Ground’s grand formation.

“Senior, you’re saying... that I failed?” Even though he had heard the conversation between Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, Chu Feng wanted to verify it.

“Chu Feng, hear me out. Logically, as you’ve arrived at this place now, you should have exited the Life and Death Formation.”

“For you to not be able to exit the Life and Death Formation, a problem must’ve occurred somewhere. Chu Feng, don’t panic. Let Xunyi and I analyze the situation. We will most definitely be able to let you leave that formation,” Ying Mingchao said.

“Analyze? What utter nonsense. Those two simply do not know how to breach the formation. They must’ve gotten lucky and exited the Life and Death Formation by coincidence. They simply do not know the correct method to break through this formation.”

“Chu Feng, you must absolutely not listen to them,” After hearing what Ying Mingchao said, Her Lady Queen grew extremely furious.

As for Chu Feng, he also started to hesitate.

Even though Chu Feng was hesitant, he knew the state of his body very well.

After passing through all these trials, Chu Feng’s body was extremely weak right now. Most importantly... he was actually unable to cure his injuries.

If he had a thirty percent chance of being able to pass through the Life and Death Formation when he first arrived, now that he was seriously injured, he would at the very most only have a ten percent chance of being able to pass through the Life and Death Formation.

But, to only have a ten percent chance, his hope of success was truly faint. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Should he continue to listen to Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, or should he attempt to pass through the Life and Death Formation on his own?

At this moment, Chu Feng was stuck between a rock and a hard place.
