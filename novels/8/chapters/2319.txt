Chapter 2319 - Within Reach

“Hehe.”

After discovering that it was Chu Feng, the alarmed expressions on the Four World Spiritist Emperors disappeared, and were replaced with expressions of being overjoyed.

At this moment, the four of them stopped their operation of the spirit formation. The four of them all stood up and walked out from the four formation cores of that spirit formation. With strangely cold smiles on their faces, they began to slowly walk toward Chu Feng.

Their gazes were like those of four fierce tigers staring at three little sheep.

Why three?

The reason for that was because they felt that Chu Feng’s friends would be as easily handled as Chu Feng.

Thus, they classified both Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong as weak individuals.

“Chu Feng, this is truly what they mean by ‘there’s a road to heaven that you refuse to take, there’s no gate to hell yet you charged in,’” The Four World Spiritist Emperors’ eldest said to Chu Feng.

“Heh...” Chu Feng laughed lightly at the threat from the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

Although the Four World Spiritist Emperors were powerful, that was only true to Chu Feng and Wang Qiang. If they were to be compared to Zhao Hong, the four of them would not be a match for her.

Thus, for the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ eldest to threaten them like this, for him to plan how to torture them in his heart, how could Chu Feng not laugh?

“You’re actually still capable of laughing? Brat, do you really not know how the word ‘death’ is written?” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.

“A-are t-the f-four of you f-fools?” Wang Qiang interrupted.

“Where the hell did this stutterer come from? You actually dare to insult us?!!”

“Boom~~~”

As the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors spoke, he waved his sleeve and unleashed his rank five Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might. With power capable of toppling the mountains and overturning the seas, his oppressive might surged toward Wang Qiang. He was planning to crush Wang Qiang into a pile of meat and kill him.

“Woosh~~~”

However, before that oppressive might could reach Wang Qiang, a figure flew out from beside Wang Qiang and toward the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

“Buzz~~~”

That figure was extremely imposing. In an instant, the oppressive might unleashed by the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors vanished. Immediately afterward, that figure arrived beside the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

“Putt~~~”

“Putt~~~”

“Putt~~~”

“Putt~~~”

When that figure landed on the ground, the Four World Spiritist Emperors actually all kneeled onto the ground.

It was oppressive might. An extremely powerful oppressive might had forced them to their knees.

As for that oppressive might, it originated from that figure.

As for that figure, it was that Fairy Spirit World’s World Spirit that had fought against Chu Feng’s Five Elements Secret Technique.

Although that world spirit only possessed the cultivation of a rank three Martial Ancestor, it possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. As such, its actual battle power was that of a rank six Martial Ancestor.

Thus, even the strongest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, their eldest, was unable to match against the world spirit at all.

“This... this...”

At this moment, the Four World Spiritist Emperors started to panic. They were able to sense how powerful that world spirit was. Thus, they realized that their current situation was extremely bad.

“F-f-fools. Even y-your m-mother’s spirit formation h-has been br-broken through by us, y-yet y-you all d-dared to still h-hoot at us? D-do you all have no brains or what?” Wang Qiang said as he pointed at the Four World Spiritist Emperors.

“Arrogant bastard, we are the sons of the World Spiritist Saintess. If you all dare to do anything to us, our great mother will definitely not spare any of you,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors threatened.

“You all are truly brainless fools. Look at what sort of situation you all are in now. Yet you still dare to threaten us?” Zhao Hong frowned and revealed a displeased expression. Then, she said to her world spirit, “Give them a ruthless beating. Make it so that their mother cannot recognize them.”

Right after Zhao Hong’s order was given, her world spirit immediately started to ruthlessly attack the Four World Spiritist Emperors. As the Four World Spiritist Emperors screamed miserably, they were completely disfigured by that world spirit’s beatings.

“Stop! You all are truly tired of living! Stop immediately!” The Four World Spiritist Emperors held their heads with their hands and began to scream nonstop. However, they were actually still threatening Chu Feng and the others.

“It seems that the beating is not ruthless enough. You should increase the intensity,” Chu Feng said.

Surprisingly, that world spirit actually listened to Chu Feng’s words, and began to beat up the Four World Spiritist Emperors even more ruthlessly. Its attacks were so ruthless that all of the bones of the Four World Spiritist Emperors were shattered from the beating.

“Chu Feng, remember this carefully. If we four brothers do not die today, we will definitely make you pay for this tenfold,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors shouted.

“You dare to continue to threaten us in this sort of state? Come, feed this to them.”

As Zhao Hong spoke, she took out four strange large bugs from her Cosmos Sack and handed them to her Fairy World Spirit.

Those four bugs greatly resembled earthworms. However, they were all over a meter long, and possessed disgusting appearances. Furthermore, one could tell with a single glance that the four insects were extremely poisonous.

“No. Don’t. Stop. What do you all want to know, we’ll tell you everything, okay?”

“Big brother, let’s just tell them what they want to know.”

“Those insects are truly too poisonous. We absolutely cannot eat them.”

Upon seeing those insects, the Four World Spiritist Emperors were immediately terrified. This was especially true for the three younger brothers. At this moment, they were trembling in fear, and began to beg for forgiveness.

The reason for that was because they were also world spiritists, and were thus capable of determining how powerful those insects were.

“Sp-speak about what? All f-four of you will die,” Wang Qiang said angrily.

However, Chu Feng suddenly said, “Wait.” He then asked, “Where is your mother right now? It is best you all tell the truth. If I am to discover a single lie, I will definitely not spare you all.”

Seeing that Chu Feng actually really began to question them, the Four World Spiritist Emperors, although extremely displeased, still chose to lower their heads and answer his questions.

After interrogating the Four World Spiritist Emperors, Chu Feng came to find out that the person who discovered this place was the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother.

Their mother possessed a special treasure. That was how she managed to break through Zhao Hong’s concealment formation and discover the ancient grand formation. Speaking of it, it could be said to be a coincidence.

When the Four World Spiritist Emperors’ mother discovered that this was a spirit formation that could grant enormous power, she was also astonished.

However, as she was in a rush to enter Grandmaster Kai Hong’s remnants and fight over its treasures with the other experts, she was unable to stay here for an extended period of time.

With no other alternative, she decided to set up this formation and have her four sons use treasures to assist them with operating the formation to undo the seal on the grand ancient formation and obtain the battle power of peak Martial Ancestors.

However, who would’ve thought that right when they were about to successfully break through the seal on the grand ancient formation, they were made fools by Chu Feng and the others?

“Chu Feng, we have told you all that you want to know. Likely, you all have also come for the battle power that this formation will bestow.”

“We are able to give you all the battle power from the spirit formation. However, you all must release us,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.

“Release you so that you all can go and find your mother to take care of us?” Chu Feng sneered. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Chu Feng, rest assured. We are people who keep our word. We promise you that as long as you release the four of us, we will write off all of our former grudges,” The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.

“Heh...” At this moment, Chu Feng laughed.

Chu Feng believed all of the things the Four World Spiritist Emperors said before. However, he absolutely did not trust them when they said that they would write off all their former grudges.

Even though the Four World Spiritist Emperors had done their best to conceal it, Chu Feng was still able to tell from their gazes that they held intense killing intent toward him.

Today, if he were to release them, they would definitely not spare him should they find the opportunity to kill him in the future.

“Feed them the insects,” Zhao Hong said coldly.

“Noo!!!”

“You three unfaithful bastards!”

“You shall all meet miserable deaths!”

“Ahh!!!!”

Hearing what Zhao Hong said, the Four World Spiritist Emperors immediately started to howl at Zhao Hong, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.

However, Zhao Hong’s world spirit simply ignored them, and forcibly fed them the four poisonous bugs.

After being force-fed, the Four World Spiritist Emperors began to scream even more miserably.

“Your screams are too unpleasant to hear,” Zhao Hong said. Then, she took out a special sack and shoved the Four World Spiritist Emperors into it.

While the Four World Spiritist Emperors were extremely large, the sack possessed a special effect. Although it was only the size of an ordinary sack, it was able to contain all four of them.

Zhao Hong then tied her special sack closed and threw it to one side. After that, she looked to the spirit formation and said, “It’s our turn now.”

Hearing what Zhao Hong said, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang looked to one another. Both of them revealed anticipating expressions.

The battle power of peak Martial Ancestors was within their reach right now.
