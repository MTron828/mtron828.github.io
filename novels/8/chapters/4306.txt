Chapter 4306 - Last Meeting

At this moment, everyone from the Demon Morph Clan, including the red-haired leader and Xianhai Renhu, felt an unprecedented shock to their hearts.

The scene before them was so terrifying that they would not even be able to dream of it in their nightmares.

It had simply overturned their understanding of the Demon Morph Clan’s strength.

The Demon Morph Clan that had once ruled over an entire galaxy and gained strength stronger than then, the Demon Morph Clan that was deemed as one of the most dangerous and wicked power by the various other powers in the martial cultivation world, was actually imprisoned and being tortured and having their bloodlines stripped away.

Even their Lord Clan Chief, someone that they had believed to be omnipotent, was unable to escape that fate.

Their Lord Clan Chief that they revered, feared and trusted in was no longer imposing and majestic like a ruler overlooking everyone.

Pain filled his face. Despair filled his eyes. He was tortured to a nearly insane state. As he screamed in pain, he subconsciously continued to beg for forgiveness. That appearance was simply too miserable.

It seemed as if he had all of his arrogance, conceit, dazzle and radiance stripped away.

He has been reduced to a lowly weakling of the lowest tier.

Suddenly, Xianhai Renhu moved his gaze away from that lightning-filled world. He looked back to the middle-aged man before them.

“Exactly who are you?”

Xianhai Renhu’s voice was trembling.

He was finally unable to restrain his emotions.

He was shivering from head to toe. Even his soul was shivering.

The fear had extended all the way into his core.

He was yet to be tortured. Yet, he was already on the verge of total collapse.

The man before him had brought upon him a despair and oppression that he had never felt before.

“Putt---”

“Putt---”

“Putt---”

Suddenly, after Xianhai Shaoyu asked that question, the Demon Morph Clansmen behind him all kneeled in midair. They began to beg Chu Xuanyuan for forgiveness.

Even that red-haired leader kneeled in midair.

He who moved his hand toward his weapon with the intention of attacking Chu Xuanyuan was now scared witless. As he begged for forgiveness, weeping sounds could be heard in his voice.

This red-haired leader was someone with a high status within the Demon Morph Clan.

Yet, at this moment, he was terrified to a near-collapse state.

Xianhai Renhu was able to understand their terror. After all, even he was on the verge of total collapse.

“Heh...”

Suddenly, Xianhai Renhu laughed. His laughter was actually one of relief. It was the laughter of someone who had accepted their fate.

“All my life, I’ve heard the phrase ‘there’s a heaven greater than the one you knew and people stronger than you” countless times.”

“When I was young, I believed that phrase to be true. I felt myself to be excessively weak. I knew that there were countless martial cultivators stronger than me in this world.”

“But, as my cultivation increased, as my experience increased, I began to feel that I am what other cultivators regarded as the ‘someone’ stronger than them.”

“I began to think that even if there are people in this world stronger than me, there wouldn’t be many.”

“But today, finally, I realized that I am merely the frog at the bottom of the well.”

After saying those words, Xianhai Renhu looked to Chu Xuanyuan.

“Having encountered you, I accept my fate. This is the fate of martial cultivators. Encountering people that they cannot afford to offend, only the fate of death awaits us.”

“I will not beg you for forgiveness. As I’ve touched your son, I know that I will not be able to escape this calamity.”

“I merely have a single request; is it possible for you to inform me exactly what your cultivation is?” Xianhai Renhu asked Chu Xuanyuan.

He knew that he and the Demon Morph Clan would all be wiped out today.

But, he wanted to know exactly what cultivation the person that was going to wipe out their Demon Morph Clan today was.

Hearing those words, the corners of Chu Xuanyuan’s mouth rose to a faint smile.

“You... are not qualified to know that.”

After saying those words, boundless attraction was unleashed from the world behind Chu Xuanyuan.

Enveloped by the attraction, Xianhai Renhu, the red-haired leader and the others from the Demon Morph Clan were all sucked into that world.

Once they were sucked in, the lightnings in that world immediately bound them. Then, the lightnings bore their way into their bodies.

From that moment on, over three hundred more people began to scream in misery in that world.

But, although the number had increased, one would not be able to determine any difference in the intensity of the screams even if one paid very close attention.

After all, compared to hundreds of millions, three hundred plus was simply too insignificant of a number.

“Buzz---”

Once Xianhai Renhu and others were sucked into that world, the world closed shut again. It began to shrink back to the original spheroid and floated onto Chu Xuanyuan’s hand.

As he retrieved the spheroid, Chu Xuanyuan bent down to inspect Chu Feng.

This man who had terrified Xianhai Renhu and others to a state of collapse was looking at Chu Feng with such a warm and loving gaze.

“Compared to the last time his bloodline went berserk in the Nine Provinces Continent, this time is even more terrifying.”

“Truly never would I imagine for Chu Feng’s bloodline to be even stronger than yours.”

“I wonder if that’s a good thing or a bad thing.”

At this moment, the Old Ape walked over.

Bloodline going berserk was something that occurs only with people that possess a sufficiently powerful bloodline.

How terrifying one’s berserking bloodline was also signified how strong one’s bloodline was.

The Old Ape knew that Chu Xuanyuan had also had his bloodline gone berserk before.

But, when that happened, it was not as terrifying as when Chu Feng’s bloodline went berserk.

Fortunately Chu Xuanyuan arrived promptly. Else, if Chu Feng’s bloodline continued to run berserk, Chu Feng might lose himself and become a demon drifting in the vast starry sky.

“It is the power that strengthens one’s bloodline that triggered Chu Feng’s bloodline to run berserk.”

“But, there’s no need to worry. I’ve already suppressed it,” said Chu Xuanyuan.

“Would it happen again in the future?” asked the Old Ape.

While a berserking bloodline was a kind of manifestation of how powerful one’s bloodline was and something that many people that possess bloodlines yearned to happen in their dreams, Old Ape does not wish for Chu Feng’s bloodline to go berserk again.

The reason for that was because it was very dangerous when one’s bloodline goes berserk. Bloodlines were living beings themselves. It was possible for bloodlines to seize their master’s consciousness.

“The condition for one’s bloodline to go berserk is actually very demanding.”

“But, the truth is, no one can be certain what sort of condition is needed for a bloodline to go berserk.”

“Even I do not know if Feng’er’s bloodline will end up berserking again.”

“But, even if it does, there’s no need to worry. Feng’er had tempered through his experience a willpower that far surpassed ordinary people.”

“With his willpower, even if his bloodline berserks again, it will not last too long,” said Chu Xuanyuan. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“You’re quite confident in Chu Feng,” said Old Ape.

“This is the benefit from having him make his way in the world on his own. Only by enduring greater amounts of suffering would one be able to temper abilities far surpassing ordinary people,” said Chu Xuanyuan.

“But, the sufferings Chu Feng experienced are simply much too much.”

Old Ape looked at the sleeping Chu Feng with a pained expression.

He clearly possesses a powerful father and could grow safely while being sheltered by his father.

Yet, he had to confront dangers upon dangers all on his own.

Old Ape actually still don’t quite understand Chu Xuanyuan. He was still worried that Chu Feng might encounter a mishap. He had also tried to urge Chu Xuanyuan against this.

But, Chu Xuanyuan had a firm conviction that he wanted Chu Feng to grow on his own.

“No one has it easy in this world.”

“If Feng’er wants to attain a level of success that others cannot, then the only correct path for him to take would be to suffer more hardships than others and experience through greater amounts of difficulties than others. Only then would he deserve the success that he would have in the future.”

“Well then, let us leave.”

Suddenly, Chu Xuanyuan stood up with the intention to leave.

“Leave?”

“You’re leaving like this? You’re not even planning to greet Chu Feng and say something to him?”

“Don’t you want him to know that we were here?”

Old Ape asked with great shock.

Evidently, he did not expect for Chu Xuanyuan to want to leave like this.

“No,” answered Chu Xuanyuan.

“But, if we are to leave this time, we might not be able to return.”

“Don’t you want to say anything to him?”

“This might be the last meeting between you and your son,” said the Old Ape.
