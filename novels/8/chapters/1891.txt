Chapter 1891 - It’s You

“Scared? Why would I be scared of a mere spirit formation?”

Chu Feng smiled again. Then, the palm with which he was grabbing that beauty trembled slightly. Like sharp blades, his spirit power pierced into that beauty’s body.

“Buzz~~~”

At that moment, that beauty’s expression turned stiff. Then, her body started to become fuzzy. The very next moment, she turned into countless rays of light; and her body started to disappear.

When the light dissipated, that beauty had completely disappeared. However, a doll had appeared in Chu Feng’s hand. That doll was extremely exquisite in appearance, and looked exactly the same as the beauty from before. Like her, that doll was also naked.

It turned out that, that naked beauty was simply not an Ancient Era’s Elf at all. Rather, she was a doll created by spirit formation.

“So boring. It was actually seen through at a single glance,” At that moment, Xian Miaomiao leapt out with her mouth pouting and a depressed expression on her face.

Upon seeing Xian Miaomiao, Chu Feng was shocked. Although this Xian Miaomiao was still only a young girl, she was even more beautiful than the doll.

The Ancient Era’s Elves all possessed exceptional beauty. Their men were as beautiful as women, and their women were as beautiful as celestial fairies. Yet, Xian Miaomiao was definitely the most beautiful Ancient Era’s Elf that Chu Feng had seen so far.

Her skin was white, yet rosy. It was as if it was made of jade. Her face was a standard oval shape. When combined with her delicate, ruby-lipped mouth and her perky little nose, she was truly exceptionally beautiful.

In addition to her own beauty, the dress that she was wearing was also extremely beautiful. It was a white short dress with pink laces. It looked both clean and natural, both noble and charming. Especially that pair of beautiful legs extending out from the dress’s little skirt, one would inevitably feel endlessly aroused upon looking at them.

At that moment, Chu Feng faintly felt the same sort of stunned sensation that he had felt the first time he had met Her Lady Queen.

However, the two women were different. Although Her Lady Queen possessed a cute and charming oval-shaped face, she was exceptionally sexy. At the same time, she did not lose any of her innocent charm. When combined with her refined facial features, she was simply perfect. There was definitely no man that could remain unaroused after seeing Her Lady Queen.

The reason for that was because Her Lady Queen possessed what men were fond of. She was a natural beauty, a flawless, dream-like beauty. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, as for the young girl before him, although she also possessed an oval-shaped face and an exceptional figure, she did not possess a trace of sexiness, nor did she possess the cold airs of being unobtainable. The feeling that she emitted could be described with two words -- fresh and pure.

This was especially true for her beautiful eyes. They were filled with spirit and cleverness.

If Her Lady Queen’s appearance could baffle all living things and make all men drool for her, then the young girl before Chu Feng was more like a beautiful pearl that one would want to hold in one’s hands and carefully admire.

Thus, this Xian Miaomiao possessed a very distinguishing beauty. Even someone like Chu Feng who had seen countless beauties was unable to help his heartbeat from accelerating and his mind from wandering the moment he saw Xian Miaomiao.

However, more than anything, Chu Feng was shocked by Xian MIaomiao’s cultivation. She was actually a rank three Martial Emperor. However, judging from her appearance, she should only be fifteen or sixteen years old. To possess this cultivation at her age, that was simply too frightening.

“What a powerful girl. Could she be that Ancient Era’s Elve’s super genius?” At that moment, even Her Lady Queen was deeply affected by Xian Miaomiao.

Chu Feng clasped his fist and asked, “Excuse me, may I ask who you might be?”

“What’s wrong, you don’t recognize me?” Seeing Chu Feng looking at her with a curious expression, Xian Miaomiao revealed a brimming sweet smile on her previously-depressed face.

“We’ve met before?” Chu Feng started to frown. He began to carefully inspect Xian Miaomiao again, and ascertained that it was really the first time that he had met her. As such, they should not have met each other before.

That being said, Chu Feng felt a weird sense of familiarity from Xian Miaomiao. Although it was very faint, he still felt that he had met her before. Merely, he could not recall where he had met her.

“Cough, cough,” At that moment, Xian Miaomiao stood there with a deadpan expression. Then, she suddenly turned around, pretended to have a male’s voice and shouted, “Hey, little lady, you haven’t told me your name yet.”

After she finished saying those words, Xian Miaomiao suddenly leapt several meters away. She turned around and exposed a sweet and slightly naughty smile. She said, “I’m not telling you.”

“It’s you?” At that moment, Chu Feng’s gaze shone, and he had a sudden realization.

He recalled how he had met a little girl in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond not long after arriving in the Holy Land of Martialism.

That little girl had stolen another’s possessions and was being chased by them. It was Chu Feng who had acted to save her.

Before that girl left, Chu Feng had asked her about her name. Merely, she did not mention her name to Chu Feng. As for the dialogue between them, it was precisely the same as the one that this young girl before him had imitated.

At that moment, Chu Feng smiled. At that moment, he was practically certain that this exceptionally beautiful and talented girl before his eye should be the Ancient Era’s Elves’ renowned little princess.

Merely, Chu Feng truly did not expect for this little princess to be the same little girl who was being chased by humans in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.

Chu Feng began to ponder. If those people that were chasing after the little princess were to know that the little girl that they were chasing that day was the Ancient Era’s Elves’ incomparably high and precious little princess, what sort of reaction would they have? Likely, they would faint from fear. Perhaps they might even piss their pants on the spot.

“Haha, you’ve finally remembered. Seems like your memory is not that bad either,” Xian Miaomiao had her hands behind her back as she walked toward Chu Feng. After arriving before Chu Feng, she nodded in satisfaction.

“Of course I remember. Even though we’ve only met once, I have a very deep impression of you. Back then... you had the appearance of a human. It would seem that you had altered your true appearance,” Chu Feng said.

“My appearance altering technique is amazing, no? Even you, a world spiritist who is able to see through my enticing beautiful doll with a single glance was unable to see through my appearance altering technique,” Xian Miaomiao snatched the doll away from Chu Feng. However, suddenly, she said somewhat unhappily, “While the test ended up in a failure and you’ve managed to see through this doll of mine, it cannot prove that you are not lecherous, nor does it mean that you have no ulterior interest in our Ancient Era’s Elves’ women.”

“Oh you. Do I really look like a lecher?” Chu Feng said helplessly.

“Woosh~~~”

At that moment, Xian Miaomiao suddenly looked to Chu Feng. Her pair of blue eyes began to carefully inspect Chu Feng. Then, with a serious expression on her face, she nodded and said, “You do.”

“Pff...”

At that moment, even Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, and ended up bursting into laughter because of that Xian Miaomiao. Even though he knew that the young girl before him was the Ancient Era’s Elves’ most respected little princess, Chu Feng did not feel any sense of restraint before her. Instead, he felt an indescribable sort of closeness.

“Little Princess, you should be able to tell me your name now, no?” Chu Feng asked. He was actually extremely grateful toward this little princess.

Before, Chu Feng was confused as to why Princess Lingyue would help him. However, after meeting this little princess, he knew the reason why. Everything was all because of this girl before him.

Xian Miaomiao sighed. “Why do people all like to ask each other’s names? Are names really that important?” She seemed to not want to tell Chu Feng her name.

“Of course one’s name is important. A name will allow one to remember another person. Else, why would you ask my name when you left back then?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s true. Very well then, I’ll tell you my name. However, you must remember that you absolutely cannot tell anyone else. Else, I will not let you get away with it,” Xian Miaomiao moved her little fists around and feigned a very vicious appearance as she said that. However, she was actually extremely adorable.

Chu Feng raised his hand and vowed, “I swear that I will not mention your name to anyone even if I am to be killed.”

“That’s more like it,” Xian Miaomiao smiled sweetly. Then, she said one word at a time, “Remember it, this Princess’s name is Xian... Miao... Miao.”
