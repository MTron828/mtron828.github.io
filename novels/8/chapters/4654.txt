Chapter 4654: What Exactly Is That?

There were 37 people in the cell at the moment. They were all bound using some special chains that could restrict their martial power and spirit power.

Of them, only 5 of them were humans, and the others were all monstrous beasts.

Judging from the appearances of these monstrous beasts, they appeared to be of a special race. They didn’t have a ferocious appearance; on the contrary, they looked noble even.

However, all of these monstrous beasts had already died. Only the five humans were still living, but they were on their last breath.

What was worthy of mention was that four of them were unconscious at the moment, and only Wang Yuxian was still awake at the moment.

From the moment the cell opened, Wang Yuxian shot a furious gaze over. However, when she caught sight of Chu Feng, a hint of astonishment flashed across her eyes as she fell into a daze.

However, she quickly concealed her astonishment and reverted back to her angry face. She chose to turn the focus of her eyes away from Chu Feng onto Lord Yunliang.

“You old beast, kill me if you want to!” Wang Yuxian bellowed angrily.

She was intentionally concealing the fact that she knew Chu Feng, possibly because she wasn’t sure whether the person before her was the Chu Feng she knew of.

While there was no difference in Chu Feng’s appearance, it was indeed bizarre for him to appear here in the form of an evil spirit.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng continued staring intently at Wang Yuxian. He noticed that there were no injuries on her, and even her clothes were intact. However, she had become so emaciated that she was almost skin and bones. Her pure face no longer had its usual vibrance, and she looked so feeble as if she had been emptied out.

It felt like someone had sapped her body of its strength and soul, and she was only moments away from death.

This made Chu Feng’s heart ache a little.

Back then, under the request of the Lady of Dao Sea, he had helped Wang Yuxian through a trial. He ruined his appearance for the trial, and they ended up spending three whole months together with one another.

In the end, it was Long Xiaoxiao using her wish with the Godwish Grandmother that restored his appearance.

During the three months they spent with one another, the two of them became good friends.

While Wang Yuxian wasn’t an arrogant person, and she usually treated others amicably too, her reticence and her unworldly atmosphere created a sense of distance between her and the others. In truth, however, she was a bubbly and cheerful girl, sometimes a little cheeky even.

It was just that she chose to show only her bubbly side to those whom she trusted the most, and other than the Lady of Dao Sea, Chu Feng was one of the few lucky ones.

Chu Feng was able to call Wang Yuxian by her nickname ‘Lele’, and Wang Yuxian accepted it as well. This was the best proof of their friendship with one another.

Thus, when Chu Feng saw the state Wang Yuxian was in, he felt sad and angry at the moment. Rage was bubbling within him that he wanted to seek out the person who did this to her and kill him!

“Chu Feng, don’t move recklessly.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

All of a sudden, Eggy’s voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ear.

While Eggy had been cultivating all this while, she was still aware of the experiences Chu Feng had gone through. She knew that Chu Feng was acquainted with Wang Yuxian, and she also knew what kind of person he was.

However, they were currently in a highly dangerous location, so she didn’t want Chu Feng to make a reckless move. Otherwise, the consequences would be dire.

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing,” Chu Feng replied.

He was also feigning ignorance of Wang Yuxian, and he didn’t attempt to communicate with her through voice transmission either. He knew that if he were to expose his true identity here, it wouldn’t be a good thing for him or Wang Yuxian. Thus, the wise move here was to grit his teeth and bear with it.

Lord Yunliang paid no heed to Wang Yuxian’s scoldings. Instead, he took out a jade bottle.

Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed upon seeing the jade bottle. He could tell that there was a powerful, vile formation inscribed on the jade bottle.

Lord Yunliang walked past Wang Yuxian and grabbed a man who was unconscious but still living. He placed the bottle at the man’s nose, and the formation swiftly came to life.

Gahhh!

The man, despite being unconscious, immediately released a pained shriek reminiscent of a pig getting butchered. It was so miserable that it induced goosebumps.

The reason why that man was reacting in such a manner was due to the bottle. The bottle was currently furiously sapping the energy within that man’s body, or to be more exact, the man’s bloodline power.

However, this man’s bloodline was a little unique. It was neither the Heavenly Bloodline nor a Divine Power; rather, it was something else.

The bottle continued to furiously sap the man’s bloodline power till the man stopped reacting altogether before finally coming to a halt.

The man was dead.

His energy was completely sapped dry by that bottle, resulting in his death.

Following that, Lord Yunliang moved on to do the same to Wang Yuxian and the other three surviving humans, sapping their bloodline powers. However, what was notable was that the bloodline powers sapped from them were extraordinary.

Seeing this sight, Chu Feng roughly understood why Wang Yuxian was brought here. Even though he still didn’t know what the purpose of these Asura Evil Spirits was, it was clear that they were collecting unique bloodline powers form cultivators.

Based on Chu Feng’s knowledge, the act of collecting this sort of power usually heralded something ominous.

Wang Yuxian and the other three were much more fortunate than the first man. Even though their bodies had weakened considerably after having their energies sapped, at the very least, they survived the ordeal.

After finishing this, Lord Yunliang quickly left with Chu Feng.

While Chu Feng was very worried for Wang Yuxian, in order not to incur the suspicion of Lord Yunliang, he chose to simply leave with him for the time being. In fact, he didn’t say a word at all.

The next location they headed to was Lord Yunliang’s own sleeping chamber. This sleeping chamber was both large and extravagant. However, there were no maids or guards on standby; it seemed like Lord Yunliang lived here all alone.

“You’re a world spiritist, right?” Lord Yunliang asked.

“Yes, Lord Yunliang. I’m a world spiritist.”

Even though he replied humbly, he felt that Lord Yunliang was asking the obvious, especially since the latter had seen his world spirit earlier. But of course, he dared not to voice his complaints out loud.

However, after the trip to the prison, his opinion of Lord Yunliang had already become the worst. In fact, he even harbored killing intent toward him too.

Lord Yunliang had used that bottle to sap the powers of others till his death, and yet, he remained completely unfazed despite the viciousness of his actions. From that, it could be seen that he was a heartless and cruel individual.

“What did Black Demon tell you before sending you here?” Lord Yunliang asked.

His eyes had remained frosty cold all this while, as if he wouldn’t have any qualms killing Chu Feng right on the spot. This made him feel incredibly uneasy.

“Lord Black Demon only told me to retrieve an object for him. He said that someone would receive me once I come over, and I am to return from the same path once I obtained the object. That’s all,” Chu Feng replied honestly.

He felt that Lord Yunliang should already be aware of this, so there was no need to hide anything from him.

“Just this?”

Lord Yunliang narrowed his eyes questioningly, exerting a tremendous amount of pressure on Chu Feng.

“Yes, that’s all I’m aware of.”

As Chu Feng was speaking the truth here, he wasn’t worried at all.

“It looks I’ll have to fill you in on the details then. First and foremost, you should be informed that the item that you’re going to take away is the most important item in the Asura World Spirit Army. You’ll have to brave through great dangers in order to take it away with you. Failure will spell certain death,” Lord Yunliang said.

“Asura World Spirit Army? Aren’t those here all evil spirits? Why would they term themselves as world spirits?” Eggy murmured.

This was also the same doubt Chu Feng harbored too. However, considering Lord Yunliang’s short temper, he dared not to ask about things that were inconsequential.

But as for the details regarding the mission, given the risks involved, he would definitely have to enquire deeper so that he wouldn’t be blindsided.

“Lord Yunliang, what’s the item I need to take away with me?” Chu Feng asked.
