Chapter 4144 - Chu Feng’s Worry

The series of giant words formed by the black clouds had covered the entire region.

They left behind an enormous shadow that covered all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.

Upon thinking that the terrifying lightning from earlier was actually related to Chu Feng, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen finally realized that they’d courted a calamity.

All of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen turned deathly pale and shivered in fear.

None of them dared to even say anything.

They’d offended someone they could not afford to offend.

“Putt~~~”

Suddenly, someone knelt on the ground. It was the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder Zuoqiu Hanxun.

“It’s a misunderstanding. This is all a misunderstanding. We truly never intended to make things difficult for Chu Feng. We never intended to make him the Lightning Guide. This is truly all a misunderstanding.”

“Milord, please forgive us, please forgive us.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zuoqiu Hanxun began to kowtow as he apologized. His behavior was like that of a commoner pleading to the gods for forgiveness. His behavior was extremely low and humble.

This scene shocked all of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.

That was their aloof and remote Supreme Elder. Never had they seen him act so humble and low before.

Suddenly, Zuoqiu Hanxun shouted at the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen, “Why are you all still standing there?! Quickly, kneel down!”

Anger filled his voice.

Once his words were spoken, the other Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen immediately knelt.

They began to beg for forgiveness with him.

However, there was still someone standing. That would be the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Zzzzz~~~”

Right at that moment, lightning began to surge in the black clouds again.

The lightning that suddenly appeared turned all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen pale with fright.

The sudden reappearance of the lightning seemed to be a warning.

But, who was it warning? Naturally, it would be the only person that hadn’t knelt, their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

Seeing that, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s expression contorted in fear and he immediately knelt.

He was terrified. He was afraid that the lightning would strike down at him.

Even though the lightning in the sky was not as numerous as before, it was still as mighty, still something that he could not contend against.

Surprisingly, after the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief knelt, the lightning not only began to dissipate, but even the black clouds began to scatter.

Although they’d avoided a crisis, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were even more terrified than before.

This was especially true for their Lord Clan Chief.

He had originally been slightly skeptical as to whether or not the events were truly related to Chu Feng.

However, he had confirmed that the matter was truly related to Chu Feng.

Chu Feng possessed an enormous origin. Behind him was an enormous and even omnipotent existence.

Even though the black clouds had scattered, cold sweat still covered the faces of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen. They continued to kneel for a long time, afraid to get up.

They had nearly suffered the extermination of their entire clan.

......

Chu Feng had no knowledge of what had happened after he left.

Although he had managed to successfully leave the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation using the teleportation formation, the process of the teleportation had still taken some time.

Chu Feng had decided on where to teleport with Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin’er.

Because of that, after some time passed, Chu Feng exited the teleportation channel.

When Chu Feng exited he saw Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin’er.

“Brother Chu Feng, it’s truly great that you’re alright.”

Fumo Xin’er and Fumo Shaoyu immediately ran over to him.

Even though they had joyous smiles on their faces, Chu Feng could see how worried they were.

Evidently, those two friends that he had not known for very long had been worried about his safety the entire time.

“It’s over now,” said Chu Feng.

“I saw. Although the distance was very far, I still saw the lightning that gathered in the sky.”

“The might of the Divine Lightning Affliction is truly not in vain.”

“Brother Chu Feng, you must’ve successfully made a breakthrough, right?” asked Fumo Shaoyu.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded.

After that, he gave the Fumo siblings a detailed account of the things that had happened inside the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.

This included how he had defeated the two geniuses of the Zuoqiu Clan, and how he placed a curse on Zuoqiu Tiancheng.

After learning what had happened the Fumo siblings were unable to conceal their happiness, and were smiling gleefully.

They both felt what Chu Feng had done to be truly refreshing.

The only unfortunate thing was the fact that they had not been there to personally witness how he had toyed with the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.

That said, after being immersed in joy, Fumo Shaoyu noticed that something was amiss, as Chu Feng did not have much of a joyous look on his face.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’ve taught the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan a huge lesson. Thus, why do you look unhappy?” asked Fumo Shaoyu.

“The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan is extremely powerful.”

“I was only able to gain the upper hand with the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation’s barrier and your teleportation formation.”

“In terms of actual strength, I am far inferior to them.”

“During the time I crossed swords with them, I forgot to conceal my identity. With that, they will definitely retaliate against me.”

“Even though I’ve left a curse on Zuoqiu Tiancheng to prevent them from retaliating against me, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan will definitely not let this matter go. They will most definitely investigate my identity.”

“Furthermore, they will also request the help of experts to remove the curse.”

“If they’re unable to remove the curse, they will have restraining fear, and will not dare to mess around.”

“However, if there’s someone that is capable of removing the curse, they will not have any apprehensions anymore, and will most definitely unleash a massacre upon everyone related to me.”

“Sooner or later, my clan will be exposed. At that time, I would’ve brought a disaster upon my clansmen,” Chu Feng revealed his worries.

“Brother Chu Feng, I am able to understand your worries. Since that’s the case, let us return to your clan first. We can think of a way to hide your clansmen.”

“After all, ten years is not too late for a nobleman to take revenge.”

“Whilst you might not be a match for them now, you will definitely surpass them in the future.”

“It would not be too late to seek them out for revenge then,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“But, I’ve agreed to help a senior of mine.”

“Judging from the time, I might be slightly late already. I must go and find that senior first.”

“What I’m afraid of is that if I go and help my senior first, and then return to inform my clansmen afterward, it’ll be too late,” said Chu Feng.

“That’s simple. Tell me where your clan is located, and I’ll go help you inform them,” said Fumo Shaoyu.

“I’ll have to trouble brother Shaoyu then,” Chu Feng immediately thanked Fumo Shaoyu.

Although he would be inconveniencing him, that was still a very decent decision.

With that, Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu made their arrangements.

Fumo Shaoyu would go and inform the Chu Heavenly Clan, and then meet up with him at the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm.

“In that case, big brother, I’ll see you later,” said Fumo Xin’er.

“See me later?”

“Girl, what do you mean by that? Could it be that you’re planning to follow brother Chu Feng and abandon your big brother?” Fumo Shaoyu opened his mouth wide in shock.

“Big brother, I wanted to see the world. You’re only going to notify Chu Feng’s clan. Once you’re done, you’ll come find us. Wouldn’t that be fine?”

“Besides, you have my tracking talisman. It would be easier for you to find us if I’m with Chu Feng,” Fumo Xin’er said with a beaming smile.

“To put a person of the opposite sex over your own brother, you’re truly devoid of conscience.”

“Very well, Fumo Xin’er, I, Fumo Shaoyu, will remember this.”

“Farewell.”

After he finished saying those words, Fumo Shaoyu stepped into a teleportation formation.

Even though Fumo Shaoyu had a look of sorrow as he expressed his farewell, Chu Feng and Fumo Xin’er were both smiling.

They knew that Fumo Shaoyu was only acting sad as a joke.

Even though Chu Feng had only known Fumo Shaoyu for a short period of time, he knew that he was a very reliable person.

Thus, he was certain that Fumo Shaoyu would be able to properly notify his clansmen.
