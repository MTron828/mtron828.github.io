Chapter 5963: Partnership

The woman and the three world spiritists revealed their spirit power—they were all at Immortal Dragon God-cloak.

However, the woman was injured, and the other three world spiritists were formidable, thus putting her in a spot.

The woman was so anxious that her eyes had turned red, and her appearance evoked pity. Yet, that only made the faces of the three world spiritists warped in glee.

“Stop escaping. We don’t want to hurt you. You should be able to tell that we don’t harbor any ill will toward you, so why bother wasting time here? Obediently reveal the secrets your Spiritualist Sacred Clan knows about this remnant, and we’ll spare you. If you try to escape, don’t blame us for getting nasty,” the leader of the three world spiritists, an old man, threatened.

Intimidated, the woman hesitated.

Boom!

A formation suddenly descended from the sky and blocked the woman’s escape. At the same time, a figure slipped in between the woman and the three world spiritists.

“Brother, are you trying to get in our way?”

The three world spiritists eyed the person before them. They didn’t make a move, but neither did they show any inclination to retreat. They could tell that the person in front of them was an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist too.

Weng!

That person waved his sleeves, and his appearance changed.

The three world spiritists immediately lost their cool. “Y-you’re Chu Feng?”

Even the woman was stunned as well. No one in the world of cultivation didn’t recognize Chu Feng’s appearance.

“I’ll give you two options. One, scram. Two, I’ll beat you up before you scram,” Chu Feng said.

Placed in a dilemma, the three world spiritists frowned. In the end, the leader turned tail and fled, and the other two followed suit. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Thank you, young hero Chu Feng.”

That woman kneeled before Chu Feng and profusely thanked him. Her eyes were still red, but her smile that emerged from having survived a conflict looked adorable.

Chu Feng eyed her before taking his leave. However, the woman darted up to him and hugged his thigh.

“What are you doing? Are you trying to capture me in exchange for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s reward?” Chu Feng asked.

“O-of course not! I wouldn’t dare!” The woman hurriedly let go and took a few steps backward. “Young hero Chu Feng, I have heard about your affairs. You’re here to clear the remnant, right? Furthermore, you defeated Jie Tian and obtained the death immunity token. I came from outside too, and I entered the remnant to look for you.”

“Why were you looking for me?” Chu Feng asked.

“I wish to follow you. Young hero Chu Feng, please take me deep into the remnant with you.”

Through the woman’s explanation, Chu Feng soon understood her intention.

The woman was Tongling Yueyue, and she was from the Spiritualist Sacred Clan.

The Spiritualist Sacred Clan had gathered a lot of information about the remnant, and around ninety years ago, they gathered their clan’s elites in hopes of clearing this remnant once and for all.

Their elites reached an unprecedented depth in the remnant, but not a single one returned alive. All of them vanished into thin air.

And to vanish in this remnant meant that they were dead.

Among them were Tongling Yueyue’s grandparents, parents, and older brother. Thus, she wanted to venture into the remnant not to find its treasure but to retrieve her clansmen’s corpses.

Unfortunately, the Spiritualist Sacred Clan had suffered heavy losses from that expedition, and the remaining clansmen, despite ninety years of effort, couldn't get anywhere close to the core of the remnant.

The Spiritualist Sacred Clan even tried to approach the Seven Realms Sacred Clan for help, only to be rejected.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I know I am asking a lot as a stranger, and I can't expect you to trust me. You might have obtained the death immunity token, but you are up against the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. If you drag this out, more experts from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion will enter the chess door, which will be to your disadvantage.

“As a token of my sincerity, my clansmen and I will follow your dispatch and help you decipher formations. Furthermore, I’ll be the only one following you; I won’t reveal your whereabouts to my clansmen.” Tongling Yueyue looked at Chu Feng with pleading eyes.

“Is this your one-sided wish, or have you come to an agreement with your clansmen?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young hero Chu Feng, my grandfather is the Spiritualist Sacred Clan’s Clan Chief. Our Spiritualist Sacred Clansmen all agree that they want to bring my grandfather and the others’ corpses out from the remnant,” Tongling Yueyue said.

“How strong is your strongest clansman?” Chu Feng asked.

“The elites of our Spiritualist Sacred Clan died ninety years ago. Of the remaining clansmen, the strongest one is only at rank seven True Dragon level. We don’t have the means to oppose the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, so we can only offer you help from the shadows.

“However, our Spiritualist Sacred Clan has spent tens of thousands of years researching this remnant, and we have our unique insight into how to decipher the formations here. I’m certain our Spiritualist Sacred Clan will be of help to you in that field,” Tongling Yueyue replied.

“I, Chu Feng, don’t fear anything. I’m not afraid of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and I wouldn’t be afraid of your Spiritualist Sacred Clan either. However, are you certain you wish to travel with me? It may endanger your life. I advise you to think things through,” Chu Feng said.

“Young hero Chu Feng, I’m begging you. Please bring me with you. I don’t need anything other than that. I, Tongling Yueyue, am willing to become your slave if you do me this favor!” Tongling Yueyue kneeled and began kowtowing. Tears streamed down from her face.

“Fine. You may come with me since you have already made up your mind. However, as you have said before, I’ll only travel with you. I won’t allow anyone else from your clan to follow us. As for deciphering the formation, there are indeed a few that I’d require your clansmen’s help. You should have a way to contact them, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes. We, as Spiritualist Sacred Clansmen, can communicate as long as we’re within a certain distance from one another. This is our clan’s ability,” Tongling Yueyue replied.

“Good.”

Chu Feng waved his sleeves, and ten runes floated out and arranged themselves in a sentence.

“Young hero Chu Feng, you...”

Tongling Yueyue gasped in shock upon seeing the runes. It was the formation deciphering key inside the chess door.

The area inside the chess door was a common space, and the formations could be repeatedly deciphered. Yet, why could some people venture deeper in, whereas others were stuck to the outer areas?

It was because of the formation deciphering key.

Everyone would receive a unique formation deciphering key upon clearing the chess door’s entrance formation. They had to first insert the formation deciphering key before clearing each formation so that the success could be attributed to them.

In other words, only the person holding the formation deciphering key would enjoy the benefits of clearing the formations. Due to that, the formation deciphering key was extremely important to the people here.

“What’s with that look?” Chu Feng asked.

“I-I just didn’t expect young hero Chu Feng to hand over your formation deciphering key to me so quickly. We have only just met, and I haven’t proved myself to you yet.” Tongling Yueyue was a little flattered.

“The key to a successful partnership is trust. I trust my judgment,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young hero Chu Feng... you are very different,” Tongling Yueyue said with pursed lips.
