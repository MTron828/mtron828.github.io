Chapter 4756: The Real King

Even though everyone thought that Zuoqiu Yanliang was being shameless, none of them dared to say a thing except for Li Muzhi. They weren’t just afraid of Zuoqiu Yanliang himself but his backing too. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They only dared to direct pitiful gazes in Chu Feng’s direction discreetly.

“Hahaha! Truly incredible, I must say. I have seen plenty of shameless individuals in my time, but you really do outdo all of them!”

Chu Feng clapped his hands in amazement.

“You bastard! How dare you insult me? I still haven’t settled the score with you for sneaking in here yet!”

Zuoqiu Yanliang released his oppressive might to curb Chu Feng.

Even though he was severely injured, he could at least use his energy now. At the very least, dealing with Chu Feng was not beyond him at the moment.

“Senior Zuoqiu, even if Chu Feng is indeed guilty, we should still leave it to the elders to judge him.”

Surprisingly, Song Qian suddenly spoke up at this moment. Even though she was on Zuoqiu Yanliang’s side, she didn’t think that it was right for a talent like Chu Feng to die here.

“Don’t worry, Junior Song. I won’t kill him here. However, I must teach him a lesson here today,” Zuoqiu Yanliang said.

“Wait a moment, there’s no need to rush to make a move,” Chu Feng hurriedly spoke up.

Hearing Chu Feng’s request here, Zuoqiu Yanliang revealed a smile of glee.

“Chu Feng, if you plead guilty right now and admit that you had enjoyed the fruits of my effort earlier with the Hellking, I can plead on your behalf before the elders so that they would let you off lightly regarding the matter of you sneaking in here.

“On the other hand, if you obstinately refuse to admit to your mistakes, I’ll teach you a lesson right here right now,” Zuoqiu Yanliang threatened.

“Hold on for a moment, you’re misunderstanding something. I have no intention of pleading guilty or begging for mercy. I just want to ask if you’re really going to be unreasonable here with just that rank three Martial Exalted level cultivation of yours over there?” Chu Feng asked.

Zuoqiu Yanliang sneered in response, “Since you’ve asked such a question, I’ll be frank with you. Yes, I’ll be the one who determines what’s reasonable here! You’re right, I’m using my strength to oppress and insult you. What are you going to do about it?”

He knew he was being unreasonable here, but at the same time, he also understood that the other party couldn’t do anything to him even if he were to force his point. His strength allowed him to do as he pleased, and he relished in such power.

“Very well. Since that’s the case, I shall be unreasonable with you too,” Chu Feng said.

“What did you say? You’ll be unreasonable with me too? Surely I’m hearing things here. Does a mere rank seven Utmost Exalted level cultivator like you really think that you have the strength to go against me?”

Zuoqiu Yanliang burst into a peal of laughter so hearty that it didn’t sound like he was severely wounded at all. He thought that Chu Feng was truly laughable.

Yet, everyone else present remained completely silent. No matter how unreasonable Zuoqiu Yanliang might be, they dared not to say anything. They could only direct a look of pity toward Chu Feng.

This was simply how the world was. Sometimes, it was not that people didn’t right from wrong, but doing the right thing might not necessarily lead to the best outcomes.

Boom!

All of a sudden, a loud rumbling sounded. It was swiftly followed by a second, a third one, and before long, it reverberated the entire sky.

Along with the emergence of lightning, the terrifying black tornado reappeared too.

Once again, the disciples found their surroundings enveloped by the black tornado, but this time around, the danger they felt from it was several times that from before. On top of that, there was an incredibly terrifying aura coming from the very center of the storm.

“What’s that?”

Everyone’s face paled upon sensing the aura as their bodies began to tremble uncontrollably. This was not a fear that could be overcome by sheer willpower, for it arose in the very depths of their soul. They had a feeling that something really bad was going to happen.

Grar!

A furious roar shook the surroundings once more.

The black tornado was torn apart, and a humongous monster stepped out from within. It was entirely black, and its silhouette towered over a hundred thousand meters tall.

It was almost as if staring in the face of a moving mountain.

Its appearance was also incredibly feral, stirring the deepest fears in one’s heart. Its skin was made out of some sort of granite-like material that seemed almost indestructible. The slight slits in its skin glowed fiery red, as if lava was flowing through its body.

What was the most terrifying of all were the crimson eyes that glowered from above like two red moons, just like harbingers of death.

This monster looked more like something that had walked straight out of hell, and it was the culprit who left the crowd feeling utterly despaired.

The monster was simply too terrifying that they couldn’t even evaluate its cultivation level. It felt like its very will could bring upon complete destruction upon the world. At this moment, all of their lives were in this monster’s grasp.

“T-this is...”

“We didn’t stop the accursed Cleansing at all. The Tiger Serpent wasn’t the Hellking in the first place! This is the real Hellking!”

It was such thorough despair that no one even thought about escaping at all. Before such an overwhelmingly superior being, the only thing they could do was to wait for it to pass judgment upon them.

Putting aside the other disciples, even Zuoqiu Yanliang’s face had turned ashen. He was so frightened that he stumbled backward and fell on his bum. His body shuddered uncontrollably as he murmured, “This is the real Hellking... This is the real Cleansing... How could there be something as terrifying as this? Did Lord Dugu Lingtian really defeat this being?”

His eyes reflected deep fear, and his words echoed the sentiments of the others present. None of them could fathom the slightest possibility of defeating this almighty being.

Grar!

While everyone was wallowing in fear, the Hellking released yet another resounding roar that left everyone feeling like their bodies were going to explode.

Despite their powerful cultivation, they still couldn’t withstand the prowess of this monster’s roar.

Knowing that this was the end, many of them closed their eyes and prepared themselves to meet their end. But even after waiting for a while, they were surprised to realize that they were still safe and sound.

So, they opened their eyes once more to look at the Hellking, only to widen them in shock.

They found the humongous Hellking kneeling before an incredibly small and insignificant individual. The individual was so small that he couldn’t even be considered as a speck of dust before the Hellking, but it was precisely this individual that left all of them astounded.

They actually recognized the person whom the Hellking was kneeling to. It was Chu Feng!

While everyone was still bewildered about the situation, Chu Feng suddenly leaped onto the head of the Hellking, and the Hellking rose back to its feet.

As it stood back up, it began emanating its domineering aura once more.

With everything that had happened, it felt more accurate to say that Chu Feng, instead of the Hellking, was the ruler of this land. No matter how powerful the Hellking was, it still stood beneath Chu Feng’s feet like a mere mount.

Everyone was dumbfounded. Even Zuoqiu Yanliang was flabbergasted by the turn of events.

Their inability to comprehend what they were seeing made their minds go completely empty.

While everyone was still shocked out of their minds, Chu Feng remarked nonchalantly, “I forgot to tell you, but I was the one who caused this Cleansing to occur.”
