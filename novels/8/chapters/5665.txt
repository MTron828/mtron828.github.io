Chapter 5665: No Wonder Her Face is Red

Boom!

With a snap of her finger, Xia Xingchen reduced the monster behind her into bits.

She then conjured a transparent porcelain bowl that cast a white light around Chu Feng. Potent medicinal energy and spirit power flowed into Ch Feng’s body and healed his injuries. It was a formidable recovery treasure, but it could only be used once.

Chu Feng knew after seeing Xia Xingchen’s current state that he could survive this ordeal without relying on his protection formation. The latter was shrouded in a beautiful but incredibly powerful aura that raised her cultivation from rank three True God level to rank five.

“It’s the Heavenly Dome Immortal Method! As if stealing the stone hall’s token wasn’t enough, you dared to steal the Heavenly Dome Immortal Method on top of that! How audacious of you, Xia Xingchen! You deserve to die a thousand times over!” the bald elder roared at Xia Xingchen.

Despite having his head crushed under Xia Xingchen’s foot, he could clearly see the aura shrouding her. That was why he was so anxious. How could he not be anxious when an outsider had obtained the complete Heavenly Dome Immortal Method?

“What are you saying, old thing? The Heavenly Dome Immortal Method is for all sect members to cultivate. On what grounds are you saying that I stole it? Could it be that the Heavenly Dome Immortal Method we have been cultivating all this while is incomplete? I guess that explains why I’ve struggled to raise my cultivation thus far,” Xia Xingchen scoffed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Cut your sarcasm, Xia Xingchen! How dare you betray the sect? Our sectmaster will not let you off no matter how talented you are!” the bald elder roared.

A powerful surge of aura burst forth from the bald elder, as his cultivation rose from rank five True God level to rank six.

Boom!

However, he was crushed back down onto the ground by Xia Xingchen’s foot before he could launch his counterattack. The latter’s aura suddenly gushed upward, causing a starry sky to appear above the stone hall.

It was a phenomenon, and it would have been grander if they had been outside the stone hall.

Xia Xingchen’s cultivation rose once more to rank six True God level. She was actually able to raise her cultivation by three ranks despite being in True God level!

“You actually cultivated our Heavenly Dome Immortal Method to such an extent?” The bald elder looked at Xia Xingchen with a mixture of fear and awe.

“Surprised? Why else do you think I’m here? My plan was perfect, but who could have thought that I had a traitor with me?” Xia Xingchen said as she turned to her maid.

Her maid realized that things had gone awry and tried to escape.

Uwa!

Xia Xingchen pulled the maid into her grasp with a powerful suction force, grasping the latter’s neck with her hand. She looked at the bald elder under her foot and asked, “It was my maid who told you about my plan to leave the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and my whereabouts, right? You wanted to monopolize the credit, so you came after me by yourself. What a pity that you have underestimated me, Xia Xingchen. You might have cultivated for twenty thousand years, but how can someone who relies on natural oddities to raise their cultivation possibly compare to me?”

“Xia Xingchen, I concede that my talent is nowhere on par with yours. Even our sectmaster grew nowhere as fast as you back when he was your age. That’s why our sect went all out to nurture you,” the bald elder said.

“You’re saying that after giving me an incomplete cultivation method?” Xia Xingchen sneered.

“The complete Heavenly Dome Immortal Method is reserved solely for the sectmaster. Even I, despite being a Qin Clansman, am not entitled to it. Given your talent, there’s a chance that you can become our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s sectmaster in the future. It’s not too late for you to turn back,” the bald elder said.

“Oh? Weren’t you the one who said earlier that the sectmaster won’t let me off if he finds out that I cultivated the complete Heavenly Dome Immortal Method? You must really think of me as a three-year-old child!” Xia Xingchen sneered.

A vicious glint flashed across her eyes, as she stomped her foot down to kill the bald elder.

However, a stream of light suddenly flowed out from the bald elder’s body and protected him from Xia Xingchen’s attack. At the same time, a surge of teleportation energy enveloped him.

“This…” Xia Xingchen belatedly noticed a stone token in the bald elder’s hand.

“Xia Xingchen, how dare you betray our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect? There’ll be no place for you in the world of cultivation! Chu Feng is also dead meat for colluding with you. Not even the Totem Dragon Clan can save him!” the bald elder’s voice echoed inside the stone hall, though he was already nowhere to be seen.

Xia Xingchen wasn’t surprised in the least. The bald elder was the Enforcement Hall’s Hall Master, after all. His cultivation might not be particularly impressive, but he was bound to have some kind of escape means.

Thus, she turned to her maid and said, “You are a maid, but I generously shared my cultivation resources with you. You are talented, but you would have never reached your current level of cultivation if not for my support. I gave you everything you had, but you betrayed me. We have known each other for centuries now, but you’re nowhere as loyal as a young friend whom I have just met moments ago. Do you know how disappointed I am in you?”

“M-milord, I was foolish to allow greed get the better of me. I have let you down. I sincerely regret what I have done. Please, give me a second chance!” the maid desperately pleaded.

Xia Xingchen’s eyes wavered. The fact that she confided in the maid her plan to leave the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect showed how highly she regarded the latter. She saw the maid as a fellow sister whom she had grown up with.

“She’s saying that because she knows that’s the only way she can survive. She’ll betray you again if you give her a second chance, and you can be certain she’ll be even more thorough the next time,” Chu Feng said.

He was all healed up, and the recovery treasure had dissipated into thin air. He was still in a weakened state, but fortunately, the earlier torture didn’t shake his foundation.

“You’re right.”

Xia Xingchen glanced at Chu Feng before retracting her gaze. Without looking at her maid, she tightened her grasp and crushed the latter’s neck with a loud ‘kacha’.

“Elder, can you give me her origin energies?” Chu Feng asked.

The maid was a True God level cultivator, after all. Her origin energies were precious nourishment to world spirits.

“You can have it all.” Xia Xingchen tossed her maid’s corpse over with a wave of her hand.

Chu Feng first siphoned away the maid’s origin energies before collating all of her treasures into a Cosmos Sack. He then walked up to Xia Xingchen to pass the Cosmos Sack to her, saying, “Elder, these are yours.”

“I already said that you can have it all.” Xia Xingchen glanced at Chu Feng before quickly turning away. Her cheeks looked unusually red.

“Elder, I can’t accept these,” Chu Feng said as he insistently walked in front of Xia Xingchen to pass her the Cosmos Sack.

“You stinky brat! What’s wrong with you? Can’t you first put on some clothes? Do you really think of me as an outsider? I’m only a few centuries older than you, and I’m still single! I might just take advantage of you if you continue flashing your body to me!” Xia Xingchen roared before turning away.

“Ah, my apologies. I was so caught up with the origin energies that I forgot that baldie destroyed my clothes.” Chu Feng awkwardly scratched his head as he realized that he was nude.

It was no wonder Xia Xingchen was so embarrassed. Even he felt embarrassed as well.
