Chapter 4892: Who Do You Think I, Chu Feng, Am?

“Chu Feng, you’re asking for it!”

Shengguang Haoxuan leaped toward Chu Feng with a ferocious look on his face. His oppressive might crushed down on the surroundings with terrifying force.

Boom!

A loud explosion sounded, causing the palace to tremble.

However, Chu Feng didn’t get injured. Shengguang Haoxuan’s attack didn’t even reach him. Instead, another force had rushed out from the crowd to collide with Shengguang Haoxuan’s oppressive might, causing the two forces to neutralize each other.

“Why did you stop me?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Shengguang Haoxuan glared at Shengguang Chuyao furiously.

He knew that the one who had stopped his attack earlier was no other than Shengguang Chuyao. He was on good terms with Shengguang Chuyao, but that didn’t mean that he would allow the latter to get in his way of punishing Chu Feng.

“Haoxuan, Brother Chu Feng is not a bad person. You were the one who provoked him first, but he chose to let you off. There’s no need for us to...” Shengguang Chuyao tried to mediate between them.

Weng!

Another white glow sealed off Shengguang Chuyao surroundings.

It was Shengguang Menglai’s doing.

“Heh. It looks like you’re determined to repay my favor with ingratitude?”

Chu Feng looked at Shengguang Menglai with contemptuous eyes.

“The members of our Holy Valley mustn’t be humiliated. Young master Chu Feng, bear with it,” Shengguang Menglai said coldly.

She then turned to Shengguang Haoxuan and said, “There’s no need to go too far. It’ll suffice to make a point.”

There was no way Chu Feng would thank her for ‘showing mercy’ to him. She was the one who orchestrated this situation, the mastermind of it all. He would have to be out of his mind to feel thankful to her.

With a cold sneer, he turned to Shengguang Haoxuan and said, “Shengguang Haoxuan, this is my final warning. If you dare make a move on me, I’ll sever your hands.”

“What a joke. Who do you think you are to threaten me? You’re no more than a powerless dog before me right now! Sever my hands? I’ll twist yours off and pull out your tongue!”

Instead of releasing his oppressive might, Shengguang Haoxuan rushed straight up to Chu Feng and swiped his claws at Chu Feng’s mouth. He was really intending to pull Chu Feng’s tongue out.

Some of the juniors of the Holy Valley relished in this cruel scene, but there were also those who turned their heads away too out of pity for Chu Feng.

Pu!

Blood splattered everywhere, followed by a scream of agony.

Those who looked away felt a clench in their hearts. There was something very wrong with that scream.

It had come not from Chu Feng but Shengguang Haoxuan.

They quickly turned back to take a look, only to be dumbfounded by what they saw.

Chu Feng was still completely unharmed, but Shengguang Haoxuan had already lost his arms. Fresh blood was spurting from the stumps left behind by the severing of his arms, and he screamed in utmost pain. There was a look of fright on his face as he staggered backward.

Shengguang Haoxuan’s severed arms were currently in a person’s hand, but that person was not Chu Feng but Shengguang Menglai.

At some point in time, Shengguang Menglai had rushed toward Chu Feng and tore off Shengguang Haoxuan’s arms.

Putting aside the other juniors, even Shengguang Xintian and Shengguang Chuyao were stunned.

What was this situation? Wasn’t Shengguang Menglai the one who told Shengguang Haoxuan to teach Chu Feng a lesson? Why would she suddenly make a move on Shengguang Haoxuan then?

“Chu Feng, you were the one who did this?” Shengguang Menglai asked as she glared at Chu Feng with eyes blazing with fury.

Shoosh!

Right after she said those words, her body suddenly began making its way toward Shengguang Haoxuan before doing something that bewildered everyone.

Shengguang Menglai had always been a lofty one in the Holy Valley, but she stuck her hand into Shengguang Haoxuan’s mouth.

Pu!

Blood splattered everywhere. She actually pulled Shengguang Haoxuan’s tongue out!

“Gah!”

Shengguang Haoxuan screamed even louder than a pig in a butcher house as he looked at Shengguang Menglai with eyes filled with fear and indignance.

It was almost as if he was asking her ‘Weren’t you the one who told me to teach Chu Feng a lesson? Why are you doing this to me?’

“Stop it, Chu Feng!” Shengguang Menglai howled.

Her roar and the pained expression on her face made everyone realize that there was something more to this situation. It appeared that Shengguang Menglai wasn’t doing these cruel acts on her own accord.

However, she began making her way toward the other juniors of the Holy Valley with blood all over her body, making quite a terrifying image. The juniors of the Holy Valley retreated fearfully at her presence.

“Stop, Chu Feng! What are you intending to do?!”

Shengguang Menglai’s initial anger was slowly turning into anxiety and horror. She realized that she was completely under Chu Feng’s control.

“Shengguang Menglai, I’ve told you that you shouldn’t blame me for taking protective measures. Did you think that I hadn’t noticed your actions? I was aware about it all along, and that’s why I cast a formation on the energy. You have indeed managed to claim possession of the energy, but in return, you came under my control. You’re my puppet now,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, if you wish to walk out of here alive, you better dispel your control over me right now!” Shengguang Menglai roared.

“Resorting to threats now, are we? I don’t think you understand the situation you’re in. No worries, I’ll give you a recap. I came here with no ill will. It was Shengguang Haoxuan who provoked and tried to kill me first; that’s why I made a move on him.

“I think I’ve already shown enough respect to your Holy Valley by sparing his life. I even allowed him to benefit from the cultivation opportunities this realm has to offer. Yet, you all know not of gratitude. The moment you get power in your hand, the first thought that comes to your mind is to teach me a lesson. You knew that you were in the wrong, but you shamelessly pushed on with it anyway.

“You must have thought that I was a pushover. I think that there’s an important need here to show you that you’re utterly wrong, or else dimwits like you will never be able to get it into your brain.

“Did you think that I dare not lay my hands on you just because we’re in the Holy Valley right now? Did you think that it’s right for you to ‘uphold the Holy Valley’s reputation’ no matter what kind of vile deeds your members committed?

“I’ll have you slaughter all of the juniors of the Holy Valley here with your own hands. I’d love to see how you’re going to face the ancestors of your Holy Valley after that!” Chu Feng spat.

Tremendous killing intent swept across the entire palace, but it was coming not from Chu Feng but Shengguang Menglai.

The faces of the Holy Valley’s juniors paled in despair, including Shengguang Menglai!
