Chapter 3606 - Lending A Helping Hand

“Y-you’re saying that my b-brother managed t-to b-benefit from t-the lake?” asked Wang Qiang.

“He managed to make two successive breakthroughs. His actual cultivation right now is that of a rank three Exalted,” replied the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“He a-actually managed to make t-tw-two successive breakthroughs? T-this d-damned b-ba-bastard, he a-actually lied t-to even me,” although Wang Qiang was speaking with great displeasure, he had an extremely overjoyed look on his face. It was clear that he was rejoicing for Chu Feng’s breakthroughs in cultivation.

“Hehe, my-my br-br-br-brother is truly amazing.”

“That Zhang Ya-yanfeng r-relied on the martial co-comprehension he gained on t-the Void Seat, in a-a-addition to the martial comprehension he gained from the lake, to ma-ma-make two successive breakthroughs. However, my b-brother only re-relied on the power of the lake t-to make two successive breakthroughs.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Hehe. He-here I w-was wondering h-how could my br-brother lose to that Zhang Yanfeng.”

“Tha-that said, he a-actually lied t-to me. I’ll t-teach him a le-lesson later.”

“He wasn’t deliberately concealing his cultivation. It is likely caused by the Sacred Tree Seed,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“Ah? It’s b-because of the S-sacred Tree Seed, t-t-that cultivation t-treasure from t-the Sacred Tree Throne?”

“Y-y-you mean t-to say t-that my br-bro-bro-brother a-act-act-act-actually managed to obtain t-the Sacred Tree Seed?” Wang Qiang became even more excited.

“He must’ve obtained it. Only the Sacred Tree Seed would cause his bloodline power to change. The Sacred Tree Seed is not that easily refined. It will fight back. That is the reason why Chu Feng’s cultivation has weakened.”

“That said, his cultivation didn’t really decrease. Once his bloodline power has refined the Sacred Tree Seed, Chu Feng will be able to recover his cultivation,” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted explained.

“He’s on-on-only going to r-re-re-recover his cultivation? W-what about the benefits from t-the Sacred Tree Seed?” asked Wang Qiang.

“Have a guess,” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted looked to Wang Qiang with suspense.

“Tsk,” Wang Qiang rolled his eyes at the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. Based on the way he looked, Wang Qiang knew that Chu Feng would definitely be able to gain benefits from the Sacred Tree Seed once it was refined by his bloodline power.

“Lord Demon Exalted, I can’t hold on anymore! Please save me!”

An ear-piercing scream was heard. Zhang Shirui cried out for help. She was still struggling, but she had expressed that she was unable to last any longer.

“Hold firm to your conviction and control yourself,” said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.

“Senior, save me! Save me!”

However, Zhang Shirui was acting as if she could not hear the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. She continued to cry for help.

“Senior, she seems to be about to collapse. Would you be able to come to her assistance?” Chu Feng asked.

Even though Chu Feng was also in great pain, not only was he able to continue to resist the pain, but he was also able to observe the others. Chu Feng discovered that even though the three Zhang siblings were all in great pain, Zhang Yanfeng’s situation was gradually improving.

As for Zhang Boyi, he was still able to withstand the pain. If he continued like that, he would definitely be able to pass the trial too.

Only Zhang Shirui was unable to withstand the pain. If this situation were to continue, her body would explode and she would die.

That was not a joke. She would really end up dying.

“If this old man were capable of helping, I would’ve done so already.”

“Young friend Chu Feng, the four of you are the ones that have assimilated with that power. You can only rely on yourselves. Even for help, it can only be the four of you helping each other.”

“However, you four should know better than anyone how strong that power is. Being already taxed to look after yourself, how could you possibly assist another?”

“Thus, the four of you truly can only rely on yourselves right now,” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said.

Right after his words were said, Chu Feng began to swim in the water haltingly. He arrived beside Zhang Shirui and placed his hands on her temples.

Then, his spirit power began to pour into her mind.

Chu Feng was actually helping Zhang Shirui.

“Young friend Chu Feng, what you’re doing is very dangerous. You will bring harm upon yourself,” the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted urged against it upon seeing it.

“Senior, you’ve said that only the four of us can fuse with this power. We four are one. If we do not help each other when we can, we will instead lose a helping hand. That would be truly detrimental,” said Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted’s gaze changed. Then, he looked to Wang Qiang who stood beside him.

“My br-brother is like t-that.”

“Otherwise, I w-wouldn’t h-have thought so h-hi-hi-highly of him.”

“Back then, I w-w-was-was conquered by his s-sp-spirit of selflessness,” said Wang Qiang.

The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted only said one sentence in response to Wang Qiang’s praises, “This brother of yours will be able to achieve greatness.”

With Chu Feng’s help, Zhang Shirui, who was on the verge of dying, slowly started to stabilize get condition.

Zhang Yanfeng and Zhang Boyi also managed to successfully withstand the power.

In the end, the looks of pain on their faces started to disappear.

The four of them had all managed to successfully withstand the complete fusion of the Void Sacred Tree’s power within the lake.

“Chu Feng.”

Seeing Chu Feng before her, Zhang Shirui had a very complicated look on her face.

She had truly felt like she was on the verge of dying earlier. She was certain that if the situation had continued on its course, she would have died.

Never had she expected to be saved. More than that, she did not expect that the person who had saved her was not the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted or her two older brothers. Instead, it was Chu Feng.

However, she had been ridiculing Chu Feng earlier.

Zhang Shirui saw that Chu Feng had a deathly pale complexion, bloodshot eyes, and appeared to be even worse off than her two older brothers.

Zhang Shirui was no fool. She knew that his current appearance was caused by him helping her.

That was the reason why she felt so complicated. Guilt and self-blame filled her heart. She felt that she was truly unworthy of Chu Feng’s help. She felt that she was an extremely bad person.

“Don’t bother saying thanks. In the future, just make sure to not curse people out,” Chu Feng said with a grin.

Chu Feng was trying to tease Zhang Shirui. He did not wish to burden her too much.

Even though she had a very nasty mouth and a rather unruly personality, Chu Feng was able to tell that the girl’s nature was not bad. His impression of her was pretty good too. Otherwise, he would not have acted to save her.

After Chu feng teased Zhang Shirui, Zhang Shirui actually opened her mouth. She wanted to laugh. However, for some unknown reason, after she opened her mouth, she started to cry.

Her crying appearance was very ugly. She felt truly sad and, more than anything, ashamed of herself. She wanted to say something to Chu Feng. Yet, she was unable to say anything.

It wasn’t that she didn’t want to say what she wanted to say. Instead, she didn’t dare to speak her mind because it was too embarrassing.

Seeing that, Zhang Yanfeng and Zhang Boyi rushed over.

“This… you two must’ve seen the situation earlier, I didn’t bully her,” Chu Feng explained.

Even without Chu Feng’s explanation, Zhang Yanfeng and Zhang Boyi knew what had happened earlier. Thus, the two of them were also filled with gratitude toward Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, thanks a lot.”

“We both witnessed what you did earlier. We truly thank you. If it wasn’t for you, our little sister would definitely not have been able to survive.”

“Thank you, truly, thank you.”

Zhang Yanfeng bowed deeply and respectfully at Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, I hope that you will forgive me for my offenses earlier,” Zhang Boyi was even more emotional. He actually directly knelt before Chu Feng.
