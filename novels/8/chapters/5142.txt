Chapter 5142: News On the Enemy

Chu Feng and Song Yuwei were in a hidden state. From the moment they left the teleportation formation, they quickly rose into the air and headed toward an ancient city.

The city had a unique architectural design. The buildings looked decrepit, but the roads were astonishingly wide. That might have been the reason why the residents preferred to walk on the roads instead of flying in the sky.

In fact, it wasn’t just humans who were walking on the city’s road but monstrous beasts who were hundreds to thousands of meters tall too. The road permitted sufficient space for them to freely move around in their real form without transmogrifying into humans.

“I can sense the aura of the Ancient Era everywhere. Is this city preserved from the Ancient Era?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

“Young master Chu Feng, this city is indeed a relic preserved from the Ancient Era. The current city lord is friendly to guests, so many cultivators would opt to drop by the city to take a rest. Over time, more and more people settled in the city, resulting in the current prosperity you see.

“That also allowed the city lord to establish a powerful information network, gathering news from all places. Our goal here is to buy information from the city lord,” Song Yuwei explained.

Chu Feng had already known that beforehand. Having fought many battles, he knew that it was imperative for him to uncover the strength of his opponents before exacting vengeance.

Song Yuwei led the way to the city lord’s residence.

The city lord might be hospitable to guests, but that didn’t mean that anyone could disturb him. This was evident from the army of guards gathered outside the city lord’s residence.

However, when Song Yuwei took out a token, the guards immediately granted them passage and led them into a majestic hall.

“Esteemed guests, our city lord is currently busy. I’ll have to ask you to wait for a moment,” the guard said.

“We don’t have much time to wait here. Please present this to your city lord,” Song Yuwei said as she took out a copper leaf.

There was nothing special about the copper leaf, but the guard’s expression immediately turned severe.

“Milord, please hold on for a moment. I’ll relay your token to our city lord right away.”

The guard took the copper leaf and left the hall.

“Elder Yuwei, what’s the copper leaf?” Chu Feng asked curiously.

He could tell that the copper leaf had a special significance to it.

“Young master Chu Feng, that leaf is a personal token of the city lord. Those in possession of those leaves are deemed to be extremely important guests. It just so happens that our young miss has once saved the city lord’s life,” Song Yuwei replied.

It didn’t take long for a middle-aged man to arrive in the hall. Chu Feng was unable to discern his cultivation through the treasures he wore, though he did appear to be a good person. From his attire, it would appear that he was the city lord.

His face warped in shock the moment he saw Song Yuwei. He quickly closed the door before walking up to her.

“Lord Yuwei, it really is you! You’re still alive!”

Tears brimmed in the middle-aged man’s eyes.

“City Lord Liang, I happened to be out when the calamity struck back then, so I’m not certain about what happened back then. Can you tell me what happened to our Golden Dragon Flame Sect?” Song Yuwei asked.

“Lord Yuwei, you don’t know the plight of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect?” City Lord Liang asked.

“Yes, that’s right,” Song Yuwei replied.

“Lord Yuwei… My condolences, but the Golden Dragon Flame Sect was completely destroyed by the Situ World Spiritist Clan.”

City Lord Liang proceeded to share details on how the Situ World Spiritist Clan destroyed the Golden Dragon Flame Sect.

In truth, Song Yuwei and Chu Feng had already guessed the outcome, but they were still infuriated when they heard the details from City Lord Liang.

However, there was a piece of good news.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan’s Clan Chief had sustained severe injuries after crossing blows with Chu Feng’s grandmother and passed away shortly after. On the other hand, Chu Feng’s grandmother was still alive even though everyone thought that she had already died.

In any case, the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s Clan Chief had paid the price for his actions.

“City Lord Liang, how strong is the most powerful expert in the Situ World Spiritist Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

This was their true motive here. They were planning to gather some information about the Situ World Spiritist Clan so that they could design a plan to deal with them.

“The Situ World Spiritist Clan suffered heavy losses back then. Not only did their clan chief succumb to his injuries and passed away, but many of their experts were also killed by Lord Luoyi in that fight. Even to this day, they still haven’t fully recovered from their losses yet.

“The current strongest expert in the Situ World Spiritist Clan is its clan chief, who is also the youngest son of the previous clan chief, Situ Kunye. However, Situ Kunye often goes into closed-door training after inheriting the clan chief position, so hardly anyone knows his cultivation level.

“Putting aside Situ Kunye, the next strongest expert in the Situ World Spiritist Clan is its grand elder, Situ Tingye. He’s at rank three Half-God level, though there are rumors that he has recently made a breakthrough to rank four Half-God level.

“In truth, Situ Tingye has been the one in charge of the Situ World Spiritist Clan all these years. What’s ironic about it is that he had only been able to become a grand elder due to his age. He was hardly known in the Situ World Spiritist Clan back when it was still at its peak. Putting aside the clan chief, there were three rank seven Half-Gods and many more rank-six and rank-five Half-Gods.

“But now, the strongest cultivator in the Situ World Spiritist Clan is the rank four Half-God level Situ Tingye. The Situ World Spiritist Clan has really paid a heavy price in that fight. Unless an outstanding junior emerges from their ranks, it’ll be hard for them to recover.

“The Situ World Spiritist Clan got what it deserves,” City Lord Liang said.

“Recover? They won’t get the chance to do so,” Chu Feng sneered.

“This young friend over here, are you the descendant of Lord Yuwei?” City Lord Liang asked out of curiosity.

“City Lord Liang, he’s my new master,” Lord Yuwei replied. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She chose not to reveal Chu Feng’s identity just to be safe even though City Lord Liang was likely to be a trustworthy individual.

“May I know how I should address you?” City Lord Liang asked.

“Chu Feng,” Chu Feng replied.

“So it’s young master Chu Feng. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

Perhaps due to his relationship with Lord Yuwei, City Lord Liang took an amiable and courteous attitude to Chu Feng, lowering his attitude despite being a proud city lord himself.

“City Lord Liang, do you have any information on Immortal Slaughterer?” Song Yuwei asked.

City Lord Liang frowned when he heard those two words. From his expression, it was clear that he knew about the Immortal Slaughterer’s involvement in the incident back then.

“City Lord Liang, is it inconvenient for you to divulge their information?” Lord Yuwei asked.

“That’s not it. Lord Yuwei, it might still be possible for you to exact vengeance on the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but it’ll be best if you don’t mess with Immortal Slaughterer.”
