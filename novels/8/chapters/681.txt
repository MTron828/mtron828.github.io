MGA: Chapter 682 - Temple of Reproduction

It had to be said that the Heaven’s Eyes was very strong, and through constant usage, Chu Feng became more and more practiced. He actually saw the distance through the layers of vision-blocking golden mist.

However, to the current Chu Feng, the Heaven’s Eyes seemed to have helped greatly. Through their gaze, Chu Feng was astonished to discover a humanoid organism in the distant mist.

Its height reached ten thousand feet, akin to a giant peak. It was so unbelievably large. Moreover, it had blood-red hair all over its body. The hair was very peculiar, as if it had been dyed by fresh blood, causing those who cast their eyes upon it to feel chills go down their spine.

Furthermore, its blood-red hair covered its entire body, preventing Chu Feng from seeing its face. He could only see a pair of eyes as big as a sun—yet completely empty—emanating overwhelming bloodlust.

Currently, the huge humanoid organism was standing in the distance, using its horrifying gaze to fiercely look at Chu Feng.

He also noticed that the organism’s right hand was holding an incomparably large sickle. On the sickle, traces of blood were all over it. There was even a large amount of blood that trickled down along the sharp sickle, making rain-pouring sounds.

In the left hand of the humanoid organism, it was carrying a vast palace-sized cage. Within the cage, it was filled with things; however, looking more carefully, Chu Feng felt chills go down his spine, and with swishes, he broke out in a cold sweat. Within the large cage, it was actually full of human heads. Moreover, the number was huge—there were more than several tens of thousands.

At that instant, Chu Feng was truly terrified because he could feel how horrifying that humanoid organism was. If it wanted to kill him, he would not have the slightest chance of escaping.

*aoo* But just at that moment, the humanoid organism suddenly cried out, as though it was frightened, and with a flash, it actually disappeared, as if it had never appeared. No traces were left behind other than the still echoing fearful howl.

“Heavens! What is that? What is making that sound? It’s so terrifying!” At the same time, Chun Wu also cried out. She, as a rank four Martial Lord, was currently akin to a startled little bird. She tightly curled up in Chu Feng’s embrace.

But it could not be blamed on her because the cry of the humanoid organism was indeed, very terrifying. So much that it was indescribable, and this was for those who were brave. Those who weren’t could perhaps even be frightened to death.

Judging by Chun Wu’s reaction of glancing everywhere, Chu Feng could see that she simply did not see the appearance of the humanoid organism. However, this could be counted as a type of fortune. Otherwise, it was likely that the beauty would be even more afraid.

After all, even Chu Feng felt chills go down his spine when he saw the humanoid organism, and what has Chu Feng not seen with all his experience? But the number of things that could make him terrified to such a degree were few within few.

“Senior Chun Wu, we should not stay long in this area. Let’s not continue deeper. Since this mist surrounds the entire Martial Marking Immortal Realm, perhaps only searching around the outside will allow us to acquire harvests.”

After seeing the humanoid organism, Chu Feng couldn’t help associating it with an organism of the Ancient Era. He finally knew how dangerous the deeper part of the mist was, and gradually became aware that the Martial Marking Immortal Realm was not a simple place at all. So, even the usually fearless him dared not to continue deeper in.

Continuing to force oneself forward into extreme danger without an absolute guarantee on one’s safety was not an intelligent move. Even if Chu Feng wanted to help Yan Ruyu, he would not take his life for a joke. Besides, he was not certain that there were definitely Martial Marking Immortal Lotuses in the deeper areas.

“Mm.” Chun Wu nodded repeatedly after hearing Chu Feng’s words.

Quickly after, Chun Wu and Chu Feng went back where they came from. Only when the aura of anger diluted and the strange noises vanished did the two of them thoroughly relax.

Afterwards, they continued searching within the mist. Though it did obstruct their vision, Chu Feng luckily had the Heaven’s Eyes. Even the night sky could be turned into a bright day, let alone mere mist.

However, things were not as simple as they seemed. In the mist, although he could find symbolic formations that Martial Markings hid themselves in, and though they were in greater numbers in comparison to the mountain ranges, he had yet to see any traces of Martial Marking Immortal Lotuses. Looking at the already darkened day, the limit of ten days approached closer and closer. Chu Feng tightly furrowed his brows, his expression twisting up. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“How can this be? Master clearly said Martial Marking Immortal Lotuses were in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. Why can’t we find them after searching the entire Martial Marking Immortal Realm?” Chun Wu, too, felt anxious when she saw Chu Feng in such a difficult state.

However, just at that moment, Chu Feng’s complexion suddenly changed because he discovered an enormous symbolic formation appearing before him. It was completely different from the ones that hid Martial Marking, because in the center of the formation, there were even three big words: “Temple of Reproduction”.

At that instant, Chu Feng first looked at Chun Wu. He saw that there were no changes on her face, which meant that the formation was concealed too; Chun Wu could not see it.

Thus, Chu Feng asked, “Senior Chun Wu, have you heard of the Temple of Reproduction?”

“Temple of Reproduction? Junior Wuqing, you’ve also heard of the Temple of Reproduction?” A bit of surprise emerged on Chun Wu’s face upon hearing such words.

“The Temple of Reproduction truly exists?” Chu Feng followed up with another question.

“I have heard my Master mention the Temple of Reproduction. I’ve heard that it’s in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm and it contains a large amount of Martial Markings inside. However, there has never been anyone who’s discovered it, so outsiders shouldn’t know of it. Junior Wuqing, where did you hear of it?” Chun Wu asked very curiously.

“Senior Chun Wu, if I tell you right now that there’s a formation in front of us and ‘Reproduction Formation’ is written on that formation, would you believe me?” Chu Feng smilingly said.

“Heavens! Junior Wuqing, is what you said true? The Temple of Reproduction is not only a place where Martial Markings are created, almost all objects within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm are produced in that place. If it truly exists, then it will definitely have the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus!” At that instant, Chun Wu was incomparably moved, and her face was full of excitement.

After hearing Chun Wu’s words, Chu Feng was elated as well. He hurriedly nodded his head and said, “This Temple of Reproduction is right before my eyes. Right now, I will be opening it.”

Upon knowing that the Temple of Reproduction was actually the largest treasure trove in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, and not only did it contain precious Martial Markings, there were even odd and special objects such as Martial Marking Immortal Lotuses, Chu Feng dallied not and willed purple-coloured Spirit Formation to surge out. He started to lay an Opening Spirit Formation.

At the same time, Chun Wu helped out as well. Since the Temple of Reproduction’s formation was too large, to want to open it was not a simple task. They had to use a slight bit more effort.

And after the two of them worked busily for two whole hours, the Opening Spirit Formation was finally completed. However, when they activated the Opening Spirit Formation to open the Temple of Reproduction, a scene they did not expect suddenly occurred.

*hmm*

A boundless pillar of light suddenly shot explosively from the location of the Temple of Reproduction. Not only did it rise into the air, it was illuminating, lighting up the darkness of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm into a brightness similar to day.

Such an abrupt change of environment instantly attracted everybody’s attention. Those who were situated in all sorts of places within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm cast their gazes in the direction of Chu Feng and Chun Wu, all at the same time.
