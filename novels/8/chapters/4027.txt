Chapter 4027 - Thank Your Master For Me

“Damn it.”

Finally, Chu Feng opened his eyes.

He looked at the enormous hand slowly descending from the sky above.

Two kinds of expressions appeared in his eyes.

The first was a sense of unreconciliation. He was unwilling to accept everything ending like that.

As for the other, it was a sense of despair.

Witnessing the enormous hand appearing from the sky above, Chu Feng knew that it was a power that was impossible for him to defeat. It was a power that the current him couldn’t possibly defeat no matter what.

“It would appear that I’ll have to call it quits here.”

Even though he was very unwilling, Chu Feng did not hesitate too much. Rather, he took out a talisman paper.

That talisman paper was the same talisman paper Yuan Shu had given him earlier.

Chu Feng activated the talisman paper, which immediately turned into a lump of energy that enveloped him.

Once that lump of energy surrounded him, it began to rapidly shrink in size. Soon, it disappeared.

When that lump of energy disappeared, Chu Feng also disappeared.

At the same time as all that was happening, outside the spirit formation, a stream of energy appeared beside Yuan Shu.

That power was the power of the talisman paper. Merely, the power that appeared was different from the one inside the spirit formation world.

The power in the spirit formation world appeared large at first, and shrank into nothingness.

As for this power, it was extremely small when it first appeared, and then began to expand.

When that power expanded to a certain degree, it burst like a bubble and from within it appeared Chu Feng. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

One thing worthy of mentioning was the spirit formation entrance that returned to normal the instant Chu Feng appeared.

It no longer showed the situation inside the spirit formation world. Rather, it had returned to the way it looked at the very beginning.

It seemed as if it were deliberately trying to prevent Chu Feng from discovering its function.

“Brother Chu Feng, are you alright?” Yuan Shu immediately rushed up to Chu Feng and asked with concern.

Even though he could tell that Chu Feng seemed to be fine on the surface, he didn’t know if his soul had suffered any damage.

“Brother Yuan, I am fine.”

“It’s just that Grandmaster Tang Chen’s spirit formation is simply too powerful. It is simply impossible for the current me to breach it,” Chu Feng said with a wry smile.

“That spirit formation is indeed too difficult. It’s been tough on you,” Yuan Shu had an ashamed look in his eyes as he said those words.

After all, he knew that it was not that Chu Feng was incompetent, but rather that his master’s spirit formation was impossible to breach from the very start.

Unless Chu Feng possessed strength surpassing that of his master, he definitely wouldn’t be able to breach that spirit formation.

Chu Feng had been played for a fool. That was why Yuan Shu felt very ashamed.

However, he also could not betray his master and tell Chu Feng the truth. Because of that, Yuan Shu felt even more guilty and ashamed of himself.

“Whilst it is true that I, Chu Feng, failed this time around, I will not give up so easily. I will definitely be able to breach this spirit formation.”

Chu Feng’s gaze was steady and firm as he said those words. It fully showed his determination to breach the spirit formation.

“Brother Chu Feng, this spirit formation can only be challenged once. If one fails, then one will never be able to challenge it again,” said Yuan Shu.

“Brother Yuan, I know the rules. This time, I am challenging the spirit formation as a representative of senior Ox-nose.”

“However, next time, I will be challenging it representing myself,” said Chu Feng.

Seeing Chu Feng like that, Yuan Shu didn’t know how to respond.

After all, even if Chu Feng were to attempt the spirit formation ten thousand more times, he still wouldn’t be able to breach it.

Afterwards, Chu Feng and Yuan Shu chatted a bit before Chu Feng decided to take his leave.

Yuan Shu personally saw Chu Feng off the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

However, during their goodbyes, Chu Feng seemed to have suddenly recalled something, and hurriedly turned around.

“Oh, that’s right. Brother Yuan Shu, if Grandmaster Tang Chen returns, please express my thanks to him.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed. With a smile, he said, “Forget I said it. I’ll thank him myself in the future.”

“Brother Yuan Shu, farewell.”

After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng clasped his fist and bowed. Then, he left the Seven Suns Mountain Range.

“What does brother Chu Feng mean by his words earlier?”

“Could it be that he discovered the spirit formation is something that cannot be breached?”

Seeing Chu Feng’s back as he left, Yuan Shu began to ponder.

He did not ponder for long. Soon, he turned around and returned to that forbidden area.

He arrived at the entrance of that undefeatable grand formation.

“Master, brother Chu Feng has left, shouldn’t you show yourself now?” Yuan Shu asked loudly. There was a slight bit of ill-intent in his tone.

He wanted to speak out for the injustice that Chu Feng had received.

His intuition told him that his master was still there. That was why he had returned.

“Buzz~~~”

Sure enough, not long after Yuan Shu said those words, the space nearby started to tremble. Then, Grandmaster Tang Chen appeared.

However, different from what Yuan Shu had anticipated, Grandmaster Tang Chen was not in great spirits. Rather, he felt somewhat downcast and dispirited. He seemed like he had received some sort of setback.

After he walked over to Yuan Shu, he sat on the ground with a putt.

Then, he took out a tobacco pipe. After igniting the tobacco, he began to smoke.

Seeing that, Yuan Shu, who had originally wanted to criticize his master, immediately felt his heart tensing up.

He knew his master very well, and knew of his bad habit. His master was someone who would not normally smoke. However, whenever he received some sort of setback, he would chain smoke nonstop.

Whenever his master started smoking, it would mean that he had received an enormous setback.

Because of that, Yuan Shu realized that something bad had happened the instant he saw his master’s pipe.

“Master, what is wrong?”

“Did you encounter something difficult?” Yuan Shu walked towards Grandmaster Tang Chen and asked with concern.

Grandmaster Tang Chen did not respond, and only continued to smoke his pipe.

This caused Yuan Shu to panic even more. It was the first time he had seen his master acting that way.

Finally, Grandmaster Tang Chen placed his pipe on the ground.

“I was defeated.”

When Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke, even his voice was completely dispirited and weak.

“You were defeated?” Yuan Shu was confused.

“Those seven world spirits are the ultimate profoundness of that spirit formation.”

“Those seven world spirits will devour the bloodline of the person attempting to breach the spirit formation and affect their resolution by torturing their soul. If one is to continue to persist under the torment, they will suffer a nervous breakdown and fall unconscious. With that, they’ll fail in their attempt to breach the spirit formation.”

“However, that Chu Feng’s bloodline is simply too powerful. Because of that, the seven world spirits were unable to endure it. His bloodline actually managed to forcibly shatter the ultimate profoundness of the spirit formation,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“But, didn’t that silhouette manage to scare brother Chu Feng out of the spirit formation?” asked Yuan Shu.

“No. Ever since the seven world spirits shattered, he’d successfully breached the spirit formation.”

“Couldn’t you tell that he had overtaken the ownership of the spirit formation at that time to become the ruler of that world?” asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“In that case, what was that enormous silhouette that appeared later?” asked Yuan Shu.

“That was because I was unwilling to accept defeat like that. I entered the formation core and poured my own power into it to force Chu Feng to admit defeat.”

After saying those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen picked up his pipe again and began to puff on it by the mouthful.

“So that was actually master.”

Hearing those words, Yuan Shu realized what had happened.

Chu Feng had already succeeded in breaching the spirit formation. It was just that his master had been unwilling to allow him to succeed. That was why he’d had poured his own power into the spirit formation to force him out.

He did it so that Chu Feng would believe that he had failed in breaching the spirit formation.

However, the truth was that Chu Feng had succeeded.

It was no wonder his master would feel so defeated.

After all, his master had even vowed earlier with absolute confidence that his spirit formation could not be defeated.

Yet, at the turn of an eye, it had been defeated by Chu Feng.

Furthermore, it seemed like Chu Feng had not sacrificed much to breach his master’s spirit formation.

In fact, Yuan Shu even felt that Chu Feng had managed to breach the spirit formation with relative ease.

But, that spirit formation was something that his master had put meticulous effort into, something that he was immensely proud of.

Such a spirit formation had been so easily breached by Chu Feng!

Because of that, Yuan Shu was able to understand why his master would react in such a manner.

Faced with such a situation, even if he were the one standing in his master’s shoes, he would find it very difficult to accept.
