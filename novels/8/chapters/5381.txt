Chapter 5381: Shocking Everyone

Those words induced a chuckle from Bai Yunqing and Ling Sheng’er. They could also tell that Jie Zhou had gotten stuck. This was the perfect opportunity for Chu Feng to showcase his skills.

The Ling Clansmen quietly snorted amongst themselves. They didn’t dare to express it outright, but like the Jie Clansmen, they didn’t think that Chu Feng truly possessed such capabilities.

They didn’t know how Chu Feng managed to charm their two young misses, but they were looking forward to seeing him make an embarrassment out of himself once he failed to breach the formation. By then, they would try to convince their young misses not to be fooled by him anymore. 

Chu Feng walked up to the ice mountain, where Jie Zhou had constructed a massive formation to breach it, but he didn’t make a move right away. Instead, he quietly observed the situation.

Meanwhile, Bai Yunqing, Ling Sheng’er, and Ling Mo’er were also examining the ice mountain too.

“This formation doesn’t look easy to breach. Big brother Chu Feng, do you have any clue how to go about it?” Bai Yunqing asked. 

He was able to see through his formation, but that only made it clearer to him how difficult it would be to breach it. To be frank, it was not that Jie Zhou was inept but that the ice mountain was truly difficult to deal with. Bai Yunqing had no confidence in breaching this formation even if he made a breakthrough to Purple Dragon God-cloak right now.

To make things worse, this was a sequential formation, where the subsequent formations would only pose a greater difficulty. It was despairing just to think about what they would encounter after clearing this ice mountain. 

Even so, Bai Yunqing still harbored a sliver of expectation for Chu Feng. 

“This formation can actually be easily breached. We just have to reverse decipher it,” Chu Feng replied.

“Reverse decipher it? Big brother Chu Feng, are you serious?” Bai Yunqing was so shocked that his lips were quivering.

It was not to say that it was impossible to reverse decipher a formation, but its difficulty was three times greater than normally breaching a formation. If it was already a struggle to breach this ice mountain as it was, it would have been practically impossible to reverse decipher it. 

Chu Feng also knew what Bai Yunqing was worried about, so he assured the latter by saying, “The subsequent formations will pose a challenge, but this one really isn’t that difficult.”

“Heh…” a sneer echoed.

It was Jie Zhou. He had been secretly paying attention to Chu Feng and the others, and what Chu Feng had just mentioned induced a laugh from him. It prompted him to stop channeling his formation to face Chu Feng. 

“Reverse decipher the formation? Brother Chu Feng, do you understand this formation? Reverse deciphering this formation isn’t just more difficult; it also makes the formation more aggressive. Can you take responsibility if someone gets injured due to your recklessness?” Jie Zhou asked.

“How dare that fellow criticize young master Jie Zhou? Who does he think he is?”

“I doubt that he knows anything at all. He’s probably just a fraudster.”

The Jie Clansmen had viewed Chu Feng as an eyesore for quite some time now, and the latter even made a ridiculous suggestion while they were getting frustrated from getting stuck here. 

“Reverse deciphering a formation can make a formation more aggressive, but that can be avoided through careful handling,” Chu Feng replied. 

“Do you know how refined must one’s control of spirit power be in order to avoid triggering the aggression of the formation?” Jie Zhou asked.

“I can do it,” Chu Feng replied.

Jie Zhou frowned. He hadn’t expected Chu Feng to be so bold as to say such words. To be honest, he didn’t think that such a thing was possible, not only for him but all world spiritists in the world.

And that included Jie Ranqing too!

“You’re Chu Feng, right? Shut your mouth. What rights do you have to be barking here? You are weaker than every single one of us here. It’s thanks to young master Jie Zhou that you were able to get this far; you have only been reaping the fruits of our labor thus far!” a Jie Clansman hollered at Chu Feng.

The other Jie Clansmen expressed their approval. More and more people started baring their hostility toward Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng remained unfazed. “Shouldn’t you know better than anyone else the standard of the formations you have breached earlier on?”

“No matter what standard it is, it is far beyond the likes of you. Why don’t you give it a try if you really are that good?” a Jie Clansman sneered.

He wanted to see Chu Feng making a fool of himself.

“Jie Zhou, you have spent quite some time on this formation now. Why don’t you take a rest and let me try instead?” Chu Feng said.

“Heh… Go ahead, Brother Chu Feng,” Jie Zhou said with a smile. He then turned to the crowd and said, “Retreat together with me.”

He moved away from the ice mountain, and the Jie Clansmen followed him. They wanted to avoid getting attacked by the ice mountain when Chu Feng failed to reverse decipher it. 

Ling Mo’er, Ling Sheng’er, and Bai Yunqing remained on the spot, but just because they weren’t afraid didn’t mean that the other Ling Clansmen were fearless. 

“Young miss Mo’er, let’s retreat too. If young master Chu Feng really tries to reverse decipher the formation…”

“What about it?” Ling Sheng’er harrumphed before Ling Mo’er could speak up.

“Young miss Sheng’er, we…” The Ling Clansman looked conflicted.

“Don’t be afraid. I’ll protect all of you if anything happens. However, you are free to retreat to wherever you deem safe if you are truly frightened,” Ling Mo’er said.

Even though Ling Mo’er had allowed the others to retreat, the Ling Clansmen chose to hold their positions given that their two young misses hadn’t retreated either. 

Meanwhile, Chu Feng stepped in front of the ice mountain and released his spirit power.

“Blue Dragon God-cloak?”

Bai Yunqing and the others were overjoyed. With Chu Feng’s capabilities, there was a high chance that he could breach this formation if he had truly reached Blue Dragon God-cloak. They looked at Chu Feng’s container, which had lost its glow, and quickly understood what had happened. 

“Jie Yu.” 

Jie Zhou looked at Jie Yu with incredibly cold eyes. He had questioned the latter about Chu Feng along the way, from which he learned that Chu Feng was a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. Admittedly, Chu Feng was no ordinary White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, but he was still too weak to pose a threat.

That was also the reason Jie Zhou thought nothing about Chu Feng.

Yet, Chu Feng was displaying the strength of a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist right now, which was at odds with what Jie Yu had said.

“He was indeed at White Dragon God-cloak not too long ago. Our brothers can testify to that. I also don’t know when he reached Blue Dragon God-cloak. Could he have made a breakthrough inside the Ancient Palace?

“Look at Ling Mo’er’s and Ling Sheng’er’s containers. They have accumulated a lot of cultivation resources there. But for some reason, Chu Feng’s container is completely empty. He must have used the cultivation resources to make a breakthrough!” Jie Yu explained.

“Nonsense!” Jie Zhou shouted at Jie Yu via voice transmission.

This was hardly the first time they had been to the Ancient Palace. While it was possible to earn plenty of cultivation resources here, the amount was nowhere close to allowing one to make two simultaneous breakthroughs.  

Besides, there was more to a breakthrough than having enough cultivation resources. Enlightenment was much more important than that. Without enlightenment, a world spiritist wouldn’t be able to find the impetus to make a breakthrough no matter how many cultivation resources they have. 

For that reason, Jie Zhou thought that Chu Feng must have already reached Blue Dragon God-cloak prior to this, and Jie Yu and the others were taking him for a fool.

Grar!

Just then, Chu Feng finished constructing his formation and activated it. 

Jie Zhou looked at the formation, and his complexion turned even more awful.

“H-his formation!!! What in the world did that fellow do?!” 

The Jie Clansmen were also stunned. They sensed that Chu Feng’s formation was much stronger than Jie Zhou’s even though he was only at Blue Dragon God-cloak. It was almost as if Chu Feng was a Golden Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist!

But that should have been impossible! Chu Feng was clearly a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, judging by the spirit power he had released, and there was no way a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist could construct a formation stronger than a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. 

Boom!Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The ice mountain rumbled as an immense surge of spirit power lying dormant inside the formation threatened to pour forth.

“Be careful!” Jie Zhou warned as he strengthened the protective formation around the Jie Clansmen. 

Chu Feng was attempting to reverse decipher the ice mountain, which caused the latter to bare its aggression. Yet, even after moments passed, the terrifying spirit power contained inside the ice mountain wasn’t released. On the contrary, the spirit power started to stabilize. 

As world spiritists, they were able to quickly identify the reason behind that.

“Chu Feng is not only reverse deciphering the formation, but he even stopped the energy inside the formation from pouring out… Is he a monster?!”

The Jie Clansmen were taken aback. It finally occurred to them that Chu Feng might actually not be a fraudster but the real deal.
