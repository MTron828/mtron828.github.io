Chapter 5751: Revealing Talent

“Benefactor Yu’er, we don’t allow our participants to put their lives on the line. You may challenge each other, but please go with another bet,” Liu Kuo said.

“Fine. The loser scrams from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith,” Little Fishy said.

“This bet is no joking matter either,” the crowd murmured.

“That’s allowed,” Liu Kuo said. He turned to Jie Tian as if asking if the latter was willing to take on the bet.

“Xianhai Yu’er, you’re asking for it,” Jie Tian said before stepping onto the dueling ring. He then turned to Chu Feng and said, “Don’t worry, Chu Feng. I’ll deal with you after settling her.”

Shoosh!

While Jie Tian was still talking, Little Fishy charged up to him and hurled her fist.

The entire stage shook. Little Fishy’s fist landed squarely on Jie Tian’s barrier, but the latter’s barrier didn’t shake in the least, let alone crack.

“He has a heaven-defying battle power of one cultivation rank!” Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu exclaimed.

Jie Tian was an Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, which was comparable to a rank eight Half-God level cultivator, but his true fighting prowess was actually on par with a rank nine Half-God level cultivator.

“Incredible! Jie Tian is able to rival rank nine Half-God level cultivators despite being only at Exalted Dragon God-cloak!”

The crowd also saw Jie Tian in a different light.

“I already said it. You’re nothing without the Immemorial Star Sea’s formation armor. You can’t even breach my defense.” Jie Tian looked at Little Fishy with contemptuous eyes.

He had been bothered by his defeat in the Immemorial Star Sea, so he was overjoyed by this opportunity to correct things in front of such a huge crowd.

On the other hand, the aura around Little Fishy intensified, and two wings manifested behind her. These wings looked similar to fish gills, but they were majestic and beautiful. She looked like a true fairy in this very moment, but she emitted domineering pressure.

With that, her cultivation further rose to rank nine Half-God level.

Little Fishy hurled out yet another punch, and the barrier Jie Tian had been proud of shattered. On top of that, her punch continued surging toward Jie Tian with undiminished might.

A deep furrow formed on Jie Tian’s forehead, as he dared not let his guard down anymore. Spirit power rose from his feet and transformed into a surging dragon, which he quickly rode on in order to escape from Little Fishy’s punch.

In response, Little Fishy got into a horse stance and manifested a martial power bow in her left hand. As she drew the bow, a martial power arrow manifested on the bow.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Little Fishy released a barrage of martial power arrows at Jie Tian, but the surging dragon the latter was riding on was a special formation. Through its swift maneuvers, he evaded all of Little Fishy’s martial power arrows.

However, that wasn’t all to Little Fishy’s attack. Upon missing their target, the martial power arrows changed their trajectory to chase after Jie Tian. Evidently, these were homing arrows!

“What an incredibly flexible martial skill!”

Chu Feng could clearly see what was happening even though Chu Feng’s cultivation was lacking compared to Little Fishy and Jie Tian. Little Fishy’s martial skill was formidable—it was likely to be a God Taboo Martial Skill.

Many prodigies secretly raised their cultivation to get a better view of the battle, but only those who could raise their cultivation to rank eight Half-God level could perceive the happenings. In fact there were some rank eight Half-God level cultivators who struggled to spectate the battle due to their lacking observation skills.

Qin Xuan was an example of that. His aura had undergone three transformations, raising his cultivation by three ranks to rank nine Half-God level. His intention was not just to get a better view of the battle; he also wanted to showcase his strength to the crowd.

“Could that be the Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s God Taboo Martial Skill, God Taboo Bow Barrage?” Qin Xuan remarked.

Those words sparked a discussion from the crowd.

“Surely not? Xianhai Yu’er actually mastered the legendary God Taboo Bow Barrage?”

The truth was that most people present in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith couldn’t perceive the happenings in the battle; they were only joining in for the commotion. However, most of them had heard about the God Taboo Bow Barrage, which was why they were astonished.

“Indeed, that’s our Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s rank one God Taboo, God Taboo Bow Barrage,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

Those words gave the crowd a better idea of just how talented Xianhai Yu’er was. From the crowd’s discussions, Chu Feng understood just how formidable the martial skill was.

God Taboo Bow Barrage was a God Taboo Martial Skill the Immortal Sea Fish Clan had obtained from an ancient remnant. It was rumored that only the first Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief had managed to grasp it, but even so, he was unable to master it.

His arrows had the ability to track their target too, but if he mastered the martial skill, he would be able to explode the arrows too, and the explosions harnessed incredible might.

While the crowd was chatting, Little Fishy had already unleashed tens of thousands of martial power arrows in the dueling ring. These martial power arrows didn't blindly chase after Jie Tian but instead formed formations like a disciplined army to corner him.

It wasn’t long before Jie Tian’s escape routes were sealed. Left with no choice, he channeled his spirit power and constructed a slaughter formation to open a path through the arrows.

All of a sudden, the dueling ring shook. Even the crowd gathered around the dueling ring could feel the tremors. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

There were suddenly countless explosions around Jie Tian, unleashing cataclysmic shockwaves within the dueling ring.

“Fuck, she’s strong,” Feng Ling blurted out.

“She’s indeed formidable,” Xian Miaomiao agreed.

Qin Xuan frowned, as he remembered what Xianhai Shaoyu had previously told him. It would appear that those words weren’t just for show—Xianhai Yu’er did have the strength to beat him to death.

Xianhai Yu’er had mastered a God Taboo Martial Skill that even the first Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief couldn’t; this suggested that her talent surpassed the latter… but the first Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s Clan Chief was known to be the greatest figure to have ever appeared in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan!

Hu!

A powerful surge of spirit power suddenly sealed off the dueling ring, blocking everyone’s sight.

“Jie Tian?” Chu Feng knew right away that this was Jie Tian’s doing.

While Little Fishy’s God Taboo Martial Skill was formidable, the fact that Jie Tian could release such a powerful surge of spirit power to seal off the dueling ring meant that he was fine.

“Don’t worry, my little sister will be fine,” Xianhai Shaoyu told Chu Feng.

He had absolute confidence in his little sister and wasn’t worried in the least.
