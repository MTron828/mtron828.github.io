Chapter 2785 - Everyone Leaving

“I merely want you to know that my, Xia Yun’er’s, possessions are not something that one can use for themselves.”

After Xia Yun’er finished saying those words, she moved away from Chu Feng and smiled at him again. For Chu Feng, her current smile was very sinister and despicable.

“Woosh~~~”

Xia Yun’er soared into the sky and began to fly into the distance.

Seeing this, the disciples from the Starfall Holy Land hurriedly flew into the sky and began to follow after her.

However, at that moment, Xia Yun’er took out a paper talisman. After she used it, golden light and symbols covered her body. Her speed became extremely fast. In merely the blink of an eye, she disappeared into the distance. Even if Chu Feng were to unleash his full strength, he would not be able to catch up to her.

Under those circumstances, the people from the Starfall Holy Land were soon cast away by Xia Yun’er. Feeling helpless, they all stopped chasing after her. Dejected expressions filled their faces.

Likely, they had never imagined that Xia Yun’er would abandon them.

“Who would’ve thought that miss Xia was actually such a selfish individual? It was a mistake for me to think of her so sacredly before,” Li Xiang said in a very furious manner.

Li Xiang didn’t know that it was because of Xia Yun’er that Yuwen Tingyi had found him.

The reason for that was because what Xia Yun’er had said to Chu Feng was done through voice transmission. Thus, others were unable to hear it.

However, Xia Yun’er’s action of enjoying Buried Spirit Lake by herself and casting away everyone else was sufficient enough to let Li Xiang have a whole new understanding of her.

“Bullshit Holy Daughter. She is what they call a poisonous beauty.”

“That’s right, her heart is truly poisonous. She is someone with no regard for others.”

At that moment, Li Xiang’s two buddies also began to lash out at Xia Yun’er.

A disciple from the Immortal Armament Villa sighed and advised them, “Three brothers, it is fine for you all to say those words here. However, you must not say those kinds of things once you leave this place. Not only will no one believe you, but you might even court troubles for yourselves,” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After hearing what that Immortal Armament Villa’s disciple said, the people present all nodded their heads to express their agreement.

Xia Yun’er was not only the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter. She was also the Holy Maiden in the hearts of countless men of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

If anyone dared to speak ill of her, they would end up suffering.

“Everyone, I am sorry. I have made you all follow me for so long in vain.”

Chu Feng was feeling apologetic. After all, he had given Xia Yun’er the flying insects because he wanted to repay the debt that he owed her.

It was equivalent to Chu Feng betraying everyone’s hopes and expectations.

“Brother Chu Feng, you must not say this sort of thing. You never had the obligation to bring us to Buried Spirit Lake to begin with. We are already extremely grateful that you did not consider us a burden, and were willing to bring us along.”

“That’s right. Brother Chu Feng, I’ve seen a lot of geniuses in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. I was also fortunate to meet some of the demon-level geniuses. However, you are most definitely the one that is easiest to get along with, and the most good-natured among all the geniuses.”

At that moment, not only did not have the slightest intention of blaming Chu Feng, but instead, they were all very approving of Chu Feng’s moral character.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, a pillar of light sudden appeared in the nearby distance and began to shine brightly in the forest.

“Isn’t that the pillar that we used to enter this place? Why would it suddenly appear here?” The crowd was confused upon seeing this pillar of light.

At the moment when the crowd was confused, the voice of the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan’s Clan Chief was suddenly heard.

“I believe that all the little friends have realized how difficult the maze formation is right now. If there are people who do not wish to waste time and want to give up, you can leave the maze formation through the pillars.”

After hearing that voice, the crowd finally realized what the pillars were for. It turned out that they were there to give them the opportunity to give up.

“Big brother Chu Feng, we will bring Li Xiang out first. After all, the elders might be able to help him,” Li Xiang’s two buddies said.

“Okay. You all go out then,” Chu Feng voiced his agreement.

“Brother Chu Feng, we’ll be taking our leave too. We will tell the elders what happened here after we get out. While we do not dare to guarantee anything else, our Sacred Pellet Villa will definitely be able to bring you out of here safely,” The remaining disciples from the Sacred Pellet Villa said to Chu Feng.

“My thanks,” Chu Feng clasped his fist toward them.

“Don’t say it like that. Had it not been for Li Xiang, you wouldn’t have crippled Yuwen Tingyi’s cultivation,” The Sacred Pellet Villa’s disciples said.

After that, the Sacred Pellet Villa’s disciples began to enter the light pillar in succession.

Then, the Immortal Armament Villa’s disciples also bid their farewells to Chu Feng and entered the light pillar.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that Yuwen Tingyi, whose cultivation was crippled by Chu Feng, also crawled all the way to the light pillar. He was also planning to leave. Likely, he was planning to find others outside to heal his injuries.

Chu Feng did not attempt to stop Yuwen Tingyi from leaving.

If Chu Feng had wanted to kill him, he would’ve done so earlier. The reason why Chu Feng didn’t kill him was because Chu Feng felt that crippling his cultivation would bring about even greater suffering to Yuwen Tingyi than killing him.

After all, Yuwen Tingyi was extremely conceited. For someone like him, he would definitely grieve so much that he’d wish he was dead after losing his cultivation.

......

At the same moment. Outside the mountain. At the location where one could choose to enter either the maze formation or the training formation.

Han Yu was standing here. Although he had left the palace, he did not leave the area. Instead, he stayed here to wait for Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong.

It should be noted that apart from Han Yu, the elders and disciples from the various powers were also gathered here.

It turned out that the training formation’s training time had concluded. Thus, the crowd had all returned there..

There were many more people gathered there at that moment than the amount of people that had been gathered in the palace hall earlier.

Furthermore, they were from all different powers. Moreover, the great majority of them were elders and experts.

Most importantly, several pillars of light had appeared in there and people from the younger generation were walking out from them nonstop.

It turned out that the light pillars were not bringing people back into the palace hall. Rather, they were bringing people directly to the plaza.

“Lord Elders!”

After Li Xiang and the other disciples from the Sacred Pellet Villa emerged from the pillars, they hurriedly shouted for their Sacred Pellet Villa’s elders.

“What are you all making a big fuss about?” The elders from the Sacred Pellet Villa did not notice that something had happened to Li Xiang’s cultivation. Thus, they reacted in a very displeased manner at the shouts from the Sacred Pellet Villa’s disciples.

“Lord Elders, Li Xiang’s cultivation was crippled by another,” A disciple from the Sacred Pellet Villa’s group declared.

“What?!”

Hearing those words, the Sacred Pellet Villa’s elders immediately had a major change in expression. They immediately rushed over to Li Xiang and began to diagnose his injuries.

“Damn it, someone actually did such a cruel and malicious thing! Who did this?!” The Sacred Pellet Villa’s Elder Ma Changchun asked loudly.

From his reaction, it could be seen that he was not only extremely furious, but he was also feeling hurt for Li Xiang.

After all, Li Xiang was an outstanding disciple nurtured by their Sacred Pellet Villa. How could he not feel hurt upon seeing that Li Xiang’s cultivation had been crippled?

“It was Yuwen Tingyi. It is Yuwen Tingyi who crippled Li Xiang’s cultivation. Fortunately, Chu Feng came to Li Xiang’s rescue and helped heal him. Otherwise, we fear that Li Xiang would not have been able to keep his current rank nine Martial Ancestor-level cultivation, and would’ve become an actual cripple,” The Sacred Pellet Villa’s disciples said.

“Nonsense! There is no grievance or hatred between our Young City Master and you all, why would he cripple his cultivation?”

There were elders from the Yuwen City among the people present as well. They had no idea what had happened in the palace hall or the mountain.

However, when they saw that the Sacred Pellet Villa’s disciples were stating that it was caused by their Young City Master, their first reaction was to declare it to be untrue.
