Chapter 4971: An Acquaintance

“Senior Qiu, Chu Feng isn’t an outsider. He’s a friend of our Dao Sea,” Song Feifei quickly explained.

“Junior Feifei, the Lady of Dao Sea didn’t inform us that there’s going to be a visitor. You should know how important this matter is. We can’t let someone as suspicious as him loiter around here!”

Senior Qiu took a much more amicable tone toward Song Feifei, just that his attitude remained hard.&nbsp;

“Chu Feng, did you come here under my master’s invitation?” Song Feifei asked.

Chu Feng was just about to answer when Shengguang Baimei spoke to him through voice transmission.

“Chu Feng, this brat is just picking a fight with you for no reason. You should say that you were invited by the Lady of Dao Sea first. Didn’t you mention that you’re on good terms with her? You can explain the reason to her afterward.&nbsp;

“This brat doesn’t pose a threat to us, but things could get troublesome if that rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator comes after us.”

Chu Feng thought that it made perfect sense too. He wasn’t afraid of the small fry standing before him, but he wasn’t sure what was the stance of the rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator yet.&nbsp;

If that expert chose to make things hard for him, that would put him in a spot.&nbsp;

So, Chu Feng nodded his head and replied, “Indeed, the Lady of Dao Sea invited me here.”

“I knew it! How else could you have possibly found your way here?” Song Feifei exclaimed with a smile.

“Where’s your invitation letter?” Senior Qiu stretched his hand forth and asked.

“I don’t have one,” Chu Feng replied.

“How can you prove that you were invited by the Lady of Dao Sea without an invitation letter?” Senior Qiu questioned.

Chu Feng didn’t think that the other party would continue to pressure him even though he had already said that he was with the Lady of Dao Sea. This made him feel displeased.

“Senior Qiu, Chu Feng is on close terms with our Dao Sea. He won’t lie about something like this,” Song Feifei spoke up for Chu Feng.

“Junior Feifei, it’s not that I don’t trust you, but this matter is of grave importance. Our interests are at stake as well. Unless the Lady of Dao Sea personally verifies his identity, I can’t allow him to enter the city. Men, capture him!”&nbsp;

Senior Qiu refused to compromise.

“That won’t do, Senior Qiu! Chu Feng isn’t an outsider. How can you capture him?”&nbsp;

Song Feifei walked over to Senior Qiu’s side and pleaded on Chu Feng’s behalf. Unfortunately, her plea was of little use.

“Senior Feifei, carry me.”

All of a sudden, Yaoyao appeared beside Song Feifei and stretched her hand toward her, asking to be carried. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Song Feifei doted on Yaoyao a lot. Even though she knew that this wasn’t a good time to get distracted, she still accepted Yaoyao’s request and carried her up. Then, she turned her attention back to Senior Qiu, wanting to continue speaking up on Chu Feng’s behalf.

Pah!

A shocking sight occurred.

Yaoyao hurled her little hand against Senior Qiu’s face.&nbsp;

Caught off guard, Senior Qiu was struck in the cheek despite the difference in their cultivation levels. It was just that Yaoyao’s slap was nothing more than a tickle on the face of a Martial Exalted level cultivator even though she had exerted her full strength. &nbsp;

“You dare to hit me?”

The slap hardly dealt any damage, but Senior Qiu still lost his temper. He glared at Yaoyao with hostile eyes.

It looked as if he would have killed Yaoyao without any hesitation if not for the fact that there were bystanders around.

“Yaoyao, what are you doing?”

Song Feifei was shocked by Yaoyao’s action and Senior Qiu’s response. She subconsciously took a step back, hoping to protect Yaoyao. Having spent several days together, she knew just what kind of personality Senior Qiu had.

She was really worried that Senior Qiu would harm Yaoyao.

“Yaoyao, hurry up and apologize big brother Qiu!” Song Feifei urged.

“No! That uncle dared to bully my father! Hmph, I was already going easy on him. Wait till I grow older! I’ll suck his origin energies dry!” Yaoyao exclaimed with a pout as she hurled her little fists indignantly.

She didn’t think that she had done wrong at all. On the contrary, she felt that she hadn’t done enough.&nbsp;

Seeing that, a faint smile appeared on Chu Feng’s solemn face. He never thought that a day would come where a young child would stand up for him. It left him moved.&nbsp;

“Brat, it looks like you’re asking for a beating?”

Senior Qiu grew even angrier upon seeing that Yaoyao wasn’t remorseful over her actions at all.

“Who are you calling brat?” Chu Feng bellowed.&nbsp;

There was a change in his gaze, but Senior Qiu didn’t seem to have noticed it.&nbsp;

“Did anyone allow you to talk?” Senior Qiu spat disdainfully.

Chu Feng didn’t answer. Instead, he headed over to Song Feifei’s side and carried Yaoyao over into his embrace before turning to look at Senior Qiu.

“She’s my daughter. I won’t allow anyone to insult her,” Chu Feng replied.

“Oh, so this brat is your daughter. No wonder she’s so ill-bred. That makes you even more unqualified to join us,” Senior Qiu sneered.

“Are you courting death?”&nbsp;

Chu Feng’s face darkened as he emanated a chilling aura.

Everyone shuddered to the aura, including Senior Qiu. When they looked at Chu Feng once more, there was a complicated look in their eyes.&nbsp;

They never thought that Chu Feng could emanate such a cold aura. It was so terrifying that it frightened them.&nbsp;

“Young friend Chu Feng, you can teach him a lesson if you can’t tolerate it anymore. Even if we have to give up on the heritage, we can’t let that bastard trample all over us!”

Shengguang Baimei felt angry just looking at it, so he sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.

As for Chu Feng, he had already made up his mind to teach Senior Qiu a lesson. He had been through so much hardship that that insults couldn’t hope to faze him anymore, but he couldn’t do the same when it came to Yaoyao.&nbsp;

“What’s wrong? You look like you’re going to murder someone. Are you thinking of killing me? Do you even know who I am? Come, my neck is right here. You can swing your blade down on it whenever you want. But do you dare to?”

Even though Senior Qiu was intimidated by Chu Feng’s chilling aura for a moment there, he quickly regained his composure and became even more arrogant. He even walked up to Chu Feng, pointed to his neck, and provoked him.&nbsp;

“Who’s creating a fuss here?” a voice suddenly boomed.

Chu Feng felt a clench in his heart when he heard the voice. He turned his head over and saw an elder standing on top of the city walls.&nbsp;

“Why is she here?”

It was a familiar face.&nbsp;
