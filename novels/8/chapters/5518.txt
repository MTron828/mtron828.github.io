Chapter 5518: The Heavenly Lightning Reappears

“What’s going on?” Chu Feng was confused.

In comparison, Long Zhizhi and Long Yuhong were much calmer.

“It’s break time,” Long Zhizhi explained.

“Break time?” Chu Feng looked at Long Zhizhi in confusion.

The latter quickly explained the matter to him.

As the first batch to enter this realm, they saw a line of words in the sky that provided them with hints as to what they were supposed to do. It explained what they had to do to complete the formations, as well as the benefits they would receive from completing the formations. It also talked about the break times too.

During break times, all of the formations would temporarily hibernate except for those that had been completed. The formation cores would close off, making it impossible to continue working on the formations.

Everyone had no choice but to take a break.

This measure was prepared to grant the challengers time to recover from the depletion of their bloodline lest the burden prove too great for them to bear.

“How long is the break time?” Chu Feng asked.

“Four hours,” Long Zhizhi replied.

“I see,” Chu Feng replied with a nod as he prepared to move ahead.

It was not as if the break time hindered him from looking for Long Chengyu and the others anyway. All of a sudden, his eyes narrowed.

“You all should go ahead and meet Brother Chengyu and the others first. I’ll find you later,” Chu Feng told Long Zhizhi and the others.

“What’s wrong, young hero Chu Feng?” Long Zhizhi asked.

“It’s nothing. I just have some private affairs to attend to,” Chu Feng replied.

“All right. We’ll be heading off first.”

They weren’t worried about leaving Chu Feng alone anymore after witnessing how he escaped from Feng Jiuyue and Feng Tiansheng with ease. With his speed, even those from the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan would struggle to deal with Chu Feng, let alone the Totem Phoenix Clan.

Shortly after Long Zhizhi and Long Yuhong left, Chu Feng got up and looked for a remote place. He constructed a concealment formation over the area, followed by Divine Concealment to completely hide his presence. Following that, he took out an item from his Cosmos Sack.

It was the compass he had received earlier from that mysterious existence.

The mysterious existence had told him that he needed to decipher the compass if he wanted to escape safely with his friends, or else all of them would lose their lives here.

Some changes had occurred to the compass earlier. It wasn’t glowing, but the inscriptions on it were swiftly moving around as if they were alive. Chu Feng didn’t want to miss the changes happening to the compass, which was why he told Long Zhizhi and the others to go find Long Chengyu without him.

He kept his eyes firmly on the compass, not daring to blink even in the slightest. He noticed many subtle details on the compass that stoked his curiosity, which made him not want to miss even the slightest thing about it.

Time quickly passed.

Boom!

The realm suddenly quaked, and giant pillars of light rose from the ground into the sky. The hibernating formations had become active once more. At the same time, the inscriptions on the compass stopped moving, reverting to their original appearance.

“Four hours have passed?” Chu Feng asked Eggy.

He was usually very sensitive to time, but he was too focused on the compass’ details that he neglected the passage of time.

“Yes, four hours have passed. This compass seems to be linked to the formation here. Have you deciphered anything yet?” Eggy asked concernedly.

She had sensed how focused Chu Feng was over the past four hours, which was why she had refrained from saying a single word lest she disturbed him. She thought that Chu Feng might have figured out something within this period.

“I couldn’t decipher the compass’ secret, but the unique transformations of its inscriptions earlier contained many profound enlightenment that greatly benefited me,” Chu Feng said.

“How so?” Eggy asked.

“This won’t do. I don’t think I can wait any longer. Eggy, I’ll talk to you later. I need to cultivate right away,” Chu Feng said as he sat cross-legged on the ground.

Eggy fell silent to not interrupt him. She felt excited for him because she could tell that he had received a huge benefit from the compass.

Moments later, she sensed a huge fluctuation in the World Spirit Space’s aura, and a smile broke out on her face. It was rare for such fluctuations to occur in the World Spirit Space, and they signified one thing—Chu Feng had made a breakthrough.

Most likely, Chu Feng had made an advancement from Purple Dragon God-cloak to Gold Dragon God-cloak, which would have been equivalent to a rank five Half-God level cultivator. However, he had a single rank of heaven-defying battle power due to his world spiritist bloodline, thus putting him on par with rank six Half-God level cultivators.

If that was truly the case, he would have no fear dealing with Feng Jiuyue and Feng Tiansheng anymore.

However, Eggy still refrained from speaking to Chu Feng, as she noticed that his cultivation hadn’t stopped yet. This time around, she didn’t sense fluctuations in the World Spirit Space, which led her to think that his breakthrough would take a little longer this time around.

What she didn’t know was that the sky above the Immemorial Star Sea was filled with storm clouds and lightning bolts. Nine lightning beasts were racing across the sky, releasing deafening roars that left the cultivators present feeling frightful and uneasy.

“What a formidable heavenly lightning phenomenon! Which powerhouse has made a breakthrough here?”

The crowd outside the Immemorial Star Sea was stunned. This was hardly the first time they had encountered a phenomenon, they were still shaken by what they were witnessing right now.

On the Totem Dragon Clan’s warship, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Lord Long Xu, and the other elders were assessing the sky from the deck.

“This phenomenon is focused on the Immemorial Star Sea although it spans the entire area. Someone inside the Immemorial Star Sea must have made a breakthrough. It’s probably young friend Chu Feng,” Long Xu guessed.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief didn’t respond, but there was a faint smile hanging on his lips. He was certain that it was Chu Feng, and that reminded him of the prophecy once again.

…

The sky in the realm where Chu Feng and the others were remained clear, as if the heavenly lightning phenomenon outside was nothing but an illusion.

Boom!

With a thunderous boom, a bolt of nine-colored lightning shot down from the sky. That surprised many people, for it looked as if the lightning had appeared out of nowhere to strike them. It was so powerful that it looked nothing like the heavenly lightning phenomenon triggered by a breakthrough, so they wondered if it had something to do with the formation here instead.

In truth, the nine-colored heavenly lightning was bolting toward Chu Feng.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
