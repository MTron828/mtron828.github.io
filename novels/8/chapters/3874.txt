Chapter 3874 - Arisal Of Dispute

“That said, it’s obvious that it’s difficult to examine these spirit formation gates.”

“Even for me, I can only try my best to examine them, and will not be able to determine a certain result.”

“Perhaps in the end, I will still have to rely on your YinYang Guidance Lamps,” said Chu Feng.

“Mn. Brother Asura, if you say it like that, I’ll feel much better.”

“It’s alright, just go ahead and casually examine the spirit formation gates. After all, there’s my YinYang Guidance Lamps there,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

With that, Chu Feng began to examine the spirit formation gates with his Heaven’s Eyes.

The YinYang Guidance Lamps actually also required the use of a special power to inspect the spirit formation gates. Thus, it would take quite some time for it to complete its examination.

Because of that, the Mystic Cave Saints also began to use their own abilities to examine the two spirit formation gates.

Just like that, time slowly passed.

Unknowingly, six hours had passed.

Chu Feng’s eyes had not blinked once in the entire six hours. His gaze was fixed between the two spirit formation gates the entire time, never moving away.

Finally, Chu Feng retrieved his gaze and took a long breath.

He finally stopped his examination.

“Brother Asura, how was it? Did you manage to determine anything?”

The Mystic Cave Saints surrounded Chu Feng. They all wanted to know the result of his examination.

Chu Feng did not answer directly, and instead asked the Mystic Cave Saints, “Did you all manage to determine anything?”

“We managed to detect some clues.”

“The talismans in our body seem to not be curses. Instead, it is some sort of qualification.”

“Although we will be able to obtain the inheritances should we select the correct gate, it seems that the amount of inheritance we will be able to obtain is related to the talismans in our bodies,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“It isn’t that it seems to be the case, but rather it’s precisely the case,” said Chu Feng.

“In that case, brother Asura, exactly which gate is the gate of life?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“This one." Chu Feng pointed to the gate on the right.

“Woah. Sure enough, brother Asura is truly reliable.”

“This YinYang Guidance Lamps are simply useless. Even now, they’re unable to determine which is the gate of life.”

“Big brother, had we been deceived? Could these YinYang Guidance Lamps be fake?”

After Chu Feng made his decision, the Mystic Cave Saints all began to speak.

It was all thanks to Chu Feng that they were able to get so far. Thus, they firmly believed in his words.

Since Chu Feng said that the gate on the right was the gate of life, they felt that the gate on the right would definitely be the gate of life.

Merely, Chu Feng had already determined which gate was the gate of life, yet the YinYang Guidance Lamps still had not responded. This naturally caused them to feel rather displeased.

The YinYang Guidance Lamps were an extremely precious treasure that they had been reluctant to use for so many years.

They had kept it precisely so that they could use it for something important.

They were finally able to make use of the YinYang Guidance Lamps, yet the outcome was very disappointing, and completely different from the effect of the YinYang Guidance Lamps that they knew.

It was no wonder they would suspect them to be fake.

“That shouldn’t be the case. These YinYang Guidance Lamps are definitely real.”

Compared to the others from the Mystic Cave Saints, the Eldest was extremely certain that the YinYang Guidance Lamps were real.

“But, if they’re real, why would they not be effective?” asked the Mystic Cave Saints’ Eleventh.

“I also think that the YinYang Guidance Lamps are real," said Chu Feng.

“Ah? Brother Asura, you think they’re real?”

The Mystic Cave Saints were all surprised to hear Chu Feng say that.

As matters stood, they had great confidence in Chu Feng and were extremely confident in his ability. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Thus, when he said that he believed the YinYang Guidance Lamps to be real, it was even more convincing than their eldest brother stating that they were real.

“The ancient aura and mysterious power do not seem like things that can be forged,” Chu Feng voiced his opinion.

“Buzz~~~”

Right after Chu Feng’s words left his mouth, one of the two YinYang Guidance Lamps suddenly started shining.

After that lamp began to shine, the other lamp started changing. It turned into an enormous ‘death’ character and left an imprint on its spirit formation gate.

At that moment, of the two lamps that had entered the two spirit formation gates, one was shining, and the other had turned into the character ‘death.’

The life and death gates were clearly defined.

“This...”

However, upon seeing the result of the YinYang Guidance Lamps, the Mystic Cave Saints were all stunned. Even Chu Feng was stunned.

The way Chu Feng saw it, the left gate was the gate of death, and the right gate was the gate of life.

However, the lamp that was shining was on the gate to the left.

As for the gate on the right, the lamp had turned into an enormous ‘death’ character, something extremely eye-catching.

“How could this be?”

At that moment, the Mystic Cave Saints were looking at one another. They were momentarily at a loss as to what to do.

They had truly never anticipated that the YinYang Guidance Lamps would present such a dilemma

YinYang Guidance Lamps. They were a treasure that could determine life and death. Yet, the outcome they gave was completely different from the one Chu Feng had determined.

“Allow me to examine them again.” Chu Feng closed his eyes and rested for an entire incense stick’s worth of time. Then, he opened his eyes again and fixed them onto the two spirit formation gates.

This time around, Chu Feng did not spend a lot of time on his examination; he only spent an hour.

After his examination, Chu Feng said, “My judgement remains the same. It’s still the one on the right that’s the life gate.”

“Brother Asura, could you have made a wrong judgement?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Trust me, I wouldn’t make a wrong judgement," said Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, how about you make another careful examination?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“There’s no need for that. I’ve already confirmed that we will have to take the right gate should we wish to obtain the inheritances,” said Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had absolute confidence in his Heaven’s Eyes.

Chu Feng had been using his Heaven’s Eyes since he was in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. Up until that moment, unless it was something that his Heaven’s Eyes could not see through, his Heaven’s Eyes’ judgement had always been correct.

At that moment, Chu Feng determined that even though the gate on the right was filled with dangers, it contained clues to obtaining the inheritances. Thus, Chu Feng determined that it must be the gate of life.

“Then you must be mistaken. Brother Asura, it’s not that I don’t trust you. It’s that these YinYang Guidance Lamps would never make a mistaken judgement,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Brother Asura, what my big brother said is correct. Should it be a spirit formation, then the YinYang Guidance Lamps will definitely not make a mistake. Didn’t you also say that the YinYang Guidance Lamps are real?”

“Brother Asura, it’s truly not that we don’t trust you. But, humans can make mistakes, and horses can lose their footing. Yet, the YinYang Guidance Lamps will never be wrong.”

The others of the Mystic Cave Saints also began to persuade Chu Feng.

After they spoke, Chu Feng knew their decision.

Between Chu Feng and the YinYang Guidance Lamps, they chose the latter.

“It is precisely because this matter concerns life and death that I hope you all will trust me.”

“Trust me this one time. I will not bring you harm.”

Chu Feng’s tone was somewhat pleading as he said those words.

Although he had only been associating with the Mystic Cave Saints for a short period of time, and they had even been enemies before, Chu Feng felt that they were pretty delightful people after getting to know them.

Furthermore, even though they were extremely avaricious and valued wealth as much as their lives, their natures were actually not bad. Thus, Chu Feng did not wish for them to die.

“Brother Asura, in that case, do you think the YinYang Guidance Lamps to be real or fake?” asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“I think they are real," said Chu Feng.

“In that case, what are you hesitating for? There’s definitely no mistake in trusting the YinYang Guidance Lamps. Don’t take chances with your own life,” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“But, I still feel that I should believe in myself at a time like this.”

Even though Chu Feng was certain that the YinYang Guidance Lamps were real, he still firmly believed in his own opinion.

......

After that, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints began to try to persuade each other.

They all hoped to be able to persuade the other. However, the result was not hopeful.

Chu Feng felt helpless after discovering that he was unable to persuade the Mystic Cave Saints. Because of that, he decided that he had no choice but to walk towards the gate on the right alone.

Chu Feng wanted to risk his life and have them believe that his selection was correct.

“Brother Asura, this matter concerns life and death.”

“Do not blame me...”

Right when Chu Feng was planning to enter the gate on the right, the voice of the Mystic Cave Saints’ Eldest suddenly sounded from behind him.

At the same time as that voice was heard, a very powerful oppressive might was released from the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

That was the oppressive might of a rank one Utmost Exalted. Like an invisible tide, that oppressive might rushed towards Chu Feng and enveloped him.

Chu Feng was restricted by the oppressive might, unable to step into the gate on the right.

The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints wanted to use his martial power to forcibly drag Chu Feng into the gate on the left.
