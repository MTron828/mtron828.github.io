Chapter 3272 - Banished From One’s Clan

The location where Chu Feng stood was the same palace hall where he and the others had entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Using the cultivation key, Chu Feng had returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan. However, this also meant that he would never again be able to return to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Although that might be the case, Chu Feng had no regrets. After all, his battlefield was not a mere Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

Instead, it was the various starfields and galaxies, the entire martial cultivation world.

“Chu Feng?”

At the moment when Chu Feng was immersed in his feelings, a voice suddenly sounded.

Looking toward the voice, Chu Feng was rather surprised.

It turned out that there were actually people in the palace hall.

As for those people, one was actually the most renowned Supreme Elder of the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Hanpeng.

The Vice Hall Master of the Law Enforcement Hall, Chu Xuanzhengfa, was also present.

Beside them were several other elders that held high status in the Chu Heavenly Clan. They were all people that Chu Feng had met before. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Apart from those people who held high status in the Chu Heavenly Clan were three other individuals. As for those three individuals, they were kneeling.

Chu Feng also knew those three individuals. They were Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys.

At that moment, everyone present in the palace hall turned their eyes to Chu Feng.

A surprised look filled their eyes. Evidently, none of them had expected Chu Feng to suddenly appear there.

“Yoh, I truly never would’ve expected you three to have returned so quickly.”

“That said, what the three of you did was actually very smart. After all, there was no future outlook for the three of you should you have continued to stay in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,” Chu Feng looked to Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys and spoke with a mocking tone.

“Chu Feng, not only have you bullied and humiliated us in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, but you’ve actually chased after us to the clan after we left. Could it be that you do not even place the various esteemed lords in your eyes, and plan to bully and humiliate us before them?”

“Lord Supreme Elder, various esteemed lords, seniors, you have all witnessed it with your very eyes. That Chu Feng is simply an intolerable bully.”

“Lord Supreme Elder, various esteemed lords, seniors, please uphold justice for us!”

Chu Hongyi pleaded to Chu Hanpeng and the others with an expression of grievance on his face.

“Chu Feng, was there such a thing?” At that moment, Chu Hanpeng turned his eyes to Chu Feng.

“I have no idea what they have told you all,” Chu Feng felt that Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys must’ve spoken ill of him behind his back. Otherwise, Chu Hanpeng couldn’t possibly ask him that in such a tone.

“Chu Feng, Chu Hongyi and the others said that you were bullying the people of our clan in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, and even went as far as to banish the three of them. Was there such a thing?” Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.

“Indeed, I banished the three of them. That matter is true,” Chu Feng said.

Once Chu Feng gave such an answer, the crowd’s expressions all changed. It was not only Chu Xuanzhengfa; even Chu Hanpeng’s expression changed greatly.

They all knew what sort of status Chu Feng held in their Chu Heavenly Clan. He was deemed to be the most important person of the younger generation by their Lord Clan Chief.

Furthermore, they also knew of Chu Feng’s ability. Had it not been for Chu Feng defeating the Li Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, their Chu Heavenly Clan would’ve been completely humiliated.

Chu Feng was truly their Chu Heavenly Clan’s hope.

When Chu Hongyi and the two others brought complaints regarding Chu Feng to them, Chu Hanpeng was merely putting on an appearance of being stern.

He couldn’t possibly punish Chu Feng for real.

Ignoring the possibility that Chu Feng perhaps hadn’t really done such a thing, even if he did, as long as he provided a casual justification for his action, no one would look further into it.

That was the status that Chu Feng enjoyed in their Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, Chu Feng now actually admitted to it without hesitation. With this, it placed Chu Hanpeng and the others in a difficult situation.

It made it so that even if they wanted to give Chu Feng lenient treatment, they would not be able to do so.

“Milords, look, he has admitted to it.”

Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys immediately pointed at Chu Feng. They were wishing that these esteemed lords before them would immediately punish him.

Unfortunately, they had no idea that Chu Feng was no longer that trash child that was deemed to be unable to cultivate. Instead, he had become someone who held great status in the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“I, Chu Feng, have always been one who dares to take responsibility for my actions. What wouldn’t I dare to admit? Merely, what is this ‘bullying and humiliating my fellow clansmen?’ How come I, Chu Feng, do not know about such a thing?” Chu Feng asked with a smile on his face.

“You’ve bullied and humiliated us, is that not bullying and humiliating fellow clansmen?” Chu Hongyi asked.

“You three? Aren’t the three of you traitors to our Chu Heavenly Clan? Didn’t you three decide to serve the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan?” Chu Feng asked.

“You!!!” Hearing those words, the expressions of Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys immediately changed.

“Chu Hongyi, what is going on?!” Chu Hanpeng and Chu Xuanzhengfa asked simultaneously.

Their tones were much many times more stern than when they questioned Chu Feng.

At that moment, Chu Hongyi’s two lackeys that stood behind him turned speechless with fear. As for Chu Hongyi, he began to shiver. However, with great difficulty, he managed to contain his flustered heart, and argued, “Lord Supreme Elder, Lord Vice Hall Master, that Chu Feng is making false accusations against us. We are people that the various esteemed lords have watched grow up. Milords, you all should know our character best. How could we possibly betray our clansmen?”

“Instead, how could you all trust the words spoken by that Chu Feng?”

“That’s right. He is making false accusations against us. Milords, please uphold justice for us.”

Following Chu Hongyi, his two lackeys immediately began to lament with grievance-filled faces.

They appeared as if they’d truly suffered from gargantuan grievances.

Seeing the expressions of the three, Chu Feng remained extremely calm. Not only was he not threatened by the exquisite acting skills of the three men, but he instead had a ridiculing and contemptful gaze.

Chu Feng felt that the three of them were simply too foolish.

“Lord Supreme Elder, Lord Vice Hall Master, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang should’ve all returned to the clan, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Indeed, they’ve already returned,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“In that case, you can call them over and ask them about this matter. The truth will be known then,” Chu Feng said.

“Men! Go and call Chu Qing and the others here,” Chu Xuanzhengfa waved his sleeve.

“Yes, Milords,” someone immediately left to call Chu Qing and the others.

Seeing this, Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys were completely flabbergasted.

If Chu Qing and the others were truly called over, they would definitely be exposed.

“Milords, we know our wrongs. We know our wrongs.”

Suddenly, Chu Hongyi’s two lackeys were unable to contain themselves. Whilst weeping bitter tears, they began to kowtow and beg for forgiveness.

Seeing this, Chu Hongyi was stunned.

He had thought that Chu Feng was trash that had been expelled, and did not possess any status in the clan.

Because of this, the three of them had planned to vent their anger on Chu Feng upon their return, and fabricated a lie of Chu Feng bullying and humiliating them, bullying and humiliating their Chu Heavenly Clansmen, so as to have others uphold justice for them.

Never did Chu Hongyi ever imagine that things would turn out this way.

He had miscalculated. From the attitude that those people had toward Chu Feng, and the attitude they had toward him and his two lackeys, he had realized that Chu Feng somehow had status far superior to their own inside the clan.

After realizing this, Chu Hongyi also realized that there was nothing he could do. Immediately, Chu Hongyi also began to kowtow and beg for forgiveness.

“Humph. In that case, the ones lying were the three of you then?”

“For the sake of small benefits, you three actually dared to betray your fellow clansmen. You three are truly unworthy of being members of our Chu Heavenly Clan.”

“Men! Banish these animals from our Chu Heavenly Clan! Never again shall they take another step into our Chu Heavenly Clan’s territory!”

Chu Xuanzhengfa shouted loudly.

Once Chu Xuanzhengfa’s order was given, Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys turned ashen.

They knew that they would be punished for what they’d done in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.

However, they did not expect that they would be banished from the Chu Heavenly Clan, they did not expect that they would be punished so severely.

This sort of punishment was much greater than what they had anticipated.

“Lord Supreme Elder, we were forced with no alternative. We really didn’t do it on purpose. Please show leniency to us, please show leniency to us.”

Realizing that the situation was extremely bad, Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys immediately turned to Chu Hanpeng and the others. They hoped that they would take their grandfathers into consideration and give them a chance.

After all, their grandfathers were all people that possessed some status within the Chu Heavenly Clan.

However, never would they expect that at that moment, everyone, including Chu Hanpeng, was actually unwilling to even look at the three of them. They simply held no desire to plead for leniency for them.

At that moment, Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys even had the heart to die.

It was only at that moment that they realized how frightening of a status Chu Feng possessed in the Chu Heavenly Clan.

His status was so frightening that those that offended him would be faced with the danger of being expelled from the clan.

“Take them away!” Chu Xuanzhengfa shouted loudly.

Immediately, people from the Law Enforcement Hall forcibly threw Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys out of the palace hall.

All that remained in the palace hall were their sorrowful, heartbroken and remorseful cries for forgiveness.
