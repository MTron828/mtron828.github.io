Chapter 3634 - Soaring Abnormal Sign

Seeing the expressions of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations, that All-heaven Starfield’s head flag-bearer asked, “What’s this? Scared?”

“Enough of your bullshit. If you possess some sort of skill, why don’t you show it directly?” said the head flag-bearer from Monstrous Holy City.

“To spend such an enormous amount of time to wholeheartedly set up your formations, what you all have done is actually not wrong.”

“However, I need you to understand one thing. Before absolute power, no matter how refined your formations might be, they're still useless.”

After he finished saying those words, the All-heaven Starfield’s head flag-bearer turned looked behind him.

Following his gaze, the crowd noticed that a person stood forth from the All-heaven Starfield’s camp.

That person did not possess a tall and robust build. His appearance was also very ordinary. He was someone that no one would take note of in a crowd.

“It’s you?”

However, when the crowd’s gaze landed on him, many people revealed looks of fear.

They knew that person. That person was called Chen Hui. He was a genius from the All-heaven Starfield’s All-heaven Sect. As for the All-heaven Sect, it was the power that Nangong Yifan belonged to, the overlord of the All-heaven Starfield.

None of the people capable of becoming geniuses in the All-heaven Sect were nobodies. As for that Chen Hui, he possessed the cultivation of a rank one Exalted.

That said, that was not the important aspect. What was important was that that Chen Hui also possessed astonishingly strong chess power. In the previous Ancient Era’s Cultivator Chess matches, he had always entered the third world. Thus, it came as a shock to the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield that he was still in the first world. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The experts from the third world not only possessed overwhelming chess power, but they also possessed astonishing control over their chess power.

An existence like Chen Hui should be in the third world, since he would cause an imbalance of power in the three worlds otherwise.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, Chen Hui unleashed his attack.

He shot forth his fist and sent forth his chess power. The chess power turned into an enormous fist visible to the naked eye and smashed into the treasured ground.

Even though there was an enormous distance between them, the overwhelming might of the chess power not only reached the distant treasured ground, but it even shattered the defensive formation set up by the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations.

However, that was merely the beginning. After his first punch, he shot forth six successive punches.

With every punch, boundless chess power would be sent forth. The chess power turned into giant fists that smashed into the protective formation.

As the protective formation shattered, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were all seriously injured and left in a complete mess by a single punch. Some people even had their bodies destroyed, and were expelled from the chess formation.

In an instant, seven treasured grounds were breached in succession. With that, Chen Hui turned his gaze to the final treasured ground.

Thay treasured ground was protected by the head flag-bearer from Monstrous Holy City and many other experts.

“Come! I shall see exactly how strong your chess power is!”

The head flag-bearer from Monstrous Holy Clan unleashed his overwhelming chess power as he spoke.

He was not the only one. The chess power experts that stood behind him also unleashed their overwhelming chess power.

Affected by their chess power, the protective formation also grew even stronger, and was shining with bright light.

“Boom~~~”

Chen Hui sent forth another punch. With that, the protective formation was shattered.

The seemingly very powerful protective formation was nothing more than an empty shield before him.

Even Monstrous Holy City’s head flag-bearer was left seriously injured.

At that moment, the crowd all realized that, before absolute power, the formation that they had trained so hard for was completely futile.

“Do you all realize the circumstances you’re in now?” Chen Hui asked.

“Why would someone like you be here?” The head flag-bearer from Monstrous Holy City asked.

“It’s very simple. With Nangong Yifan in the third world, you simply have no chance of victory. Thus, it is not only limited to me being in the first world; you will also suffer the same circumstances in the second world,” said Chen Hui.

“Damn it!” Hearing those words, despair appeared on the faces of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations.

They had come to realize that it was not only they in the first world that entered such desperate straits, but the second world had actually encountered the same situation as they had.

Even though the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations had decreased their battle power by dispatching the experts that should be fighting in the third world to the first and second worlds, it was as Chen Hui had said, they had Nangong Yifan in the third world overseeing things.

As for Nangong Yifan, he was someone who had managed to turn the entire battle around and thoroughly defeat the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations all by himself.

He was deemed to be the genius with the strongest chess power in history by Lord Shoujian personally.

“Rumble, rumble, rumble~~~”

Suddenly, the surroundings started to tremble violently.

An enormous aura was affecting the surroundings. That aura was being emitted from afar.

It was from behind the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations...

A power visible to the naked eye was being released like a volcanic eruption.

That power soared directly into the sky, and reached several tens of thousands of meters.

The crowd were able to sense and even see what that power was.

It was chess power.

“Why would such an enormous amount of chess power appear all of a sudden? Is this an abnormal sign or what?!” The crowd exclaimed in surprise.

They had been to the chess formation multiple times now. However, it was the first time that they’d witnessed such a thing.

Chess power visible to the naked eye? How intensely concentrated must that chess power be?

“No, something’s wrong! Look over there!”

Suddenly, someone pointed to the bottom of the surging power and cried out in alarm. His voice was even trembling as he shouted those words.

When the crowd looked carefully in the direction he had pointed to, their expressions all changed enormously.

They discovered that there was a person at the bottom of that power. As for that person, it was Chu Feng.

If that were all there was to it, they would not be so astonished. The reason why they were so astonished was because, no matter how they looked at it, the surging chess power seemed to have originated from Chu Feng’s body.
