Chapter 5883: Entering the City

“It’d be best if Zi Ling is fine.” Chu Feng squeezed out a polite smile.

He was in no mood to smile until he confirmed that Zi Ling was safe and sound.

“She’ll be fine,” Elder Sheng replied with a smile.

He understood the underlying meaning behind those words. It was one thing if Zi Ling was fine, but if not, Chu Feng would not remain as courteous as he was. It was arrogant for a junior to utter such words, but Elder Sheng understood where he was coming from and didn’t blame him for it.

“Elder, how do you know about me?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’d be hard to find someone who doesn’t know you in the vast world of cultivation, given your resounding reputation,” Elder Sheng replied with a smile.

“Is the Three Saints Monstrous Clan related to the Ancient Era’s clans who attacked the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” Chu Feng asked.

He knew that the Three Saints Monstrous Clan was from the Ancient Era, and he had a feeling that the Ancient Era’s clans were in communication with one another. Thus, he wanted to know the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s stance regarding this matter.

“Our Three Saints Monstrous Clan has been residing in the sacred mountain; we are not in communication with the outside world. We harbor no hostility toward the present-era cultivators either,” Elder Sheng said.

At least at the moment, they weren’t enemies yet.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you should have obtained our token, right?” Elder Sheng asked.

“Elder, are you referring to this?”

Chu Feng took out the compass he had obtained after defeating the white-haired man. However, this compass now had a formation on it; he had acquired the formation from defeating the black-haired man. These two were a pair, so they perfectly complemented each other.

“Yes, that’s the token. You’ll be able to enter the sacred mountain with this token in hand. Outsiders were previously allowed to freely enter our city, but there was a recent change in the rules. You wouldn’t have been able to meet me if you didn’t have this token,” Elder Sheng said.

“Elder, are you taking me into the sacred mountain?” Chu Feng asked.

Elder Sheng turned to Chu Feng. “That depends on you.”

“Are there any benefits?” Chu Feng asked.

“Perhaps. You’ll know when you get there. Young friend Chu Feng, you said you were here out of curiosity, but that’s only one of the reasons. You’re hoping to find a fortuitous encounter here too, no?” Elder Sheng said.

“That’s right,” Chu Feng frankly replied.

There was no point lying about it.

Amidst their chatter, the two of them walked out of the labyrinth formation. The fog didn’t dissipate, but a towering wall made out of stone appeared in front of them. It looked much more imposing compared to a formation barrier.

Of course, this stone wall was reinforced with spirit power, which granted it extreme resilience. Chu Feng couldn’t hope to shake the stone wall with his current cultivation.

There were many spirit formation gates spread out in equal intervals at the foot of the walls, but they were all the same.

“This is the City Entrance Duel. Only those who cleared the challenge are allowed into our city. However, young friend Chu Feng, you may enter straight as you have already obtained the token to enter our sacred mountain,” Elder Sheng said.

“Did my father enter through here back then too?” Chu Feng asked.

“Indeed. Young friend Chu Feng, are you interested in giving it a go?” Elder Sheng asked.

“I should go through here by the rules, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right.” Elder Sheng nodded. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s do it by the rules then,” Chu Feng said. He descended to the ground and entered one of the spirit formation gates.

Elder Sheng nodded in satisfaction. He passed right through the wall.

What Chu Feng and Elder Sheng didn’t know was that they were being watched by a pair of eyes in the fog’s depths.

It was a middle-aged man with a sturdy stature. His appearance resembled the white-haired man and black-haired man, just that his scales looked much more domineering. He was none other than the incumbent clan chief who chatted with Elder Sheng earlier.

He pretended to have left earlier, but in truth, he was watching the situation from the shadows. Only after Chu Feng entered the formation and Elder Sheng left did he slip through the walls and head into the depths of the Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

After slipping through the wall, he traveled through the fog for quite some distance before he finally arrived at the Three Saints Monstrous Clan’s main city. This city was over ten thousand meters tall, so even the clouds drifted beneath its walls.

There was an invisible barrier enveloping the city walls, keeping intruders at bay.

At the center of the main city was a square.

In the square was a hundred-meter-tall stone gate, and the stone gate was empty in the middle. Above the stone gate was a massive bell that boasted a height of over a hundred meters. It floated above the stone gate as if they were one entity.

Beneath the stone gate and the massive bell was a thousand-meter-tall golden monument that towered above the stone gate and the massive bell. Despite the huge size of the golden monument, it was covered by three huge words—Chu Xuanyuan!

The square was surrounded by seats that spanned from the ground to the sky, making it quite an imposing sight. However, there was not a single person in the square.

All of a sudden, the bell trembled before shaking violently. A deep toll echoed. It wasn’t loud, but it quickly permeated the city that was so huge that its horizons couldn’t be seen.

People started appearing on the square. It didn’t take long for the empty seats to be occupied by countless figures. This commotion had attracted everyone in the city. Most of them had the same dress-up as the white-haired man and black-haired man, though their physiques and ages differed.

Very few of them resembled Elder Sheng—short, without eyes, but with a pair of huge ears.

They looked to be from different clans, but they were all from the Three Saints Monstrous Clan.

“Did someone infiltrate our realm?”

Rather than nervous, the crowd was excited to hear the bell toll.

“It’s Chu Xuanyuan’s son,” an old voice echoed. Elder Sheng’s figure descended from the sky.

The crowd bowed toward Elder Sheng, hinting at his high standing in the clan. Many of them revealed conflicted looks upon hearing the news.

They knew what Chu Xuanyuan’s name represented.
