Chapter 4013 - So Powerful

Chu Feng’s current condition was not a disguise.

In fact, he hadn’t removed the golden gas on his own. Rather, the time limit had arrived, and the power had dispersed on its own.

At that moment, Chu Feng was suffering from its backlash.

That said, he still tried his hardest to stay awake.

At that moment he was staring at the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted with a threatening gaze.

“It’s time for you to keep your promise,” said Chu Feng.

“Rest assured, I, Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, am always one to keep my word.”

“Since I’ve said that I will release them should you remove your power, I will definitely do so.”

“Not only will I spare them, but I will also not make things difficult for you. Our debt can be written off with a single stroke.”

Not only did the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s words sound very good, but he was actually doing exactly as he’d said.

He swung his sleeve through the air, and blood immediately permeated his surroundings. With that, the Mystic Cave Saints began to scream miserably.

Whilst they appeared miserable, the crimson rope that had enveloped their bodies was immediately removed from them.

Once the crimson rope was removed, their pained appearances were greatly alleviated.

“Brother Asura.”

The Mystic Cave Saints were covered in wounds.

However, they did not flee after being freed. Rather, they all flew over to Chu Feng’s side. They... wanted to treat his injury.

“Wuuahh~~~”

However, before they could even reach him, they were all restricted by a strong power.

It was the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster.

Even though the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had released the Mystic Cave Saints, the two of them had captured them.

“This is not me going back on my word. Them capturing the Mystic Cave Saints has nothing to do with me.”

The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted spread his hands wide and shrugged his shoulders.

However, it was obvious that he had anticipated that there would be people amongst the crowd that would not allow the Mystic Cave Saints to escape safely once he released them.

Likewise, they would not allow Chu Feng to escape.

His so-called keeping his promise was nothing more than a shameless act.

“You all...”

Chu Feng had a furious look on his face upon seeing that. However, there was nothing he could do.

It wasn’t that Chu Feng had not anticipated that such a thing would happen.

Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do about it. He knew that he had fallen into an absolutely passive state the moment the Mystic Cave Saints were captured.

That said, even though he had anticipated that such a thing would happen, he still felt extremely furious.

The feeling of being toyed with by others was the thing that he disliked the most.

“Wind Lightning Sword Sect, Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain, you all remember what you’ve done here.”

Chu Feng stared at the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster with a killing-intent-filled gaze.

“Young friend, you’re powerless to even protect yourself, yet you’re actually threatening us?”

“You shouldn’t bother with threats anymore.”

“Since we dared to do this, we do not fear your retaliation.”

“Hand over the treasures you’ve obtained from the stone case, and we will spare you and your friends. Else, do not blame us for being ruthless.”

Once the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s Sectmaster said those words, his oppressive might began to distort. His oppressive might was starting to oppress the Mystic Cave Saints.

“I am the one who took your treasures! If you’re capable, come at me!” Chu Feng shouted angrily.

Although his furious shout was very resounding, it revealed to the crowd how powerless he was at that moment.

Everyone could tell that the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster had seized Chu Feng’s weakness.

No matter how capable he might be, he was unable to do anything about it.

He’d hit a brick wall.

What they didn’t know was that if that mysterious treasure were still with him, Chu Feng would definitely come to terms with them and hand it over.

Unfortunately, the mysterious treasure had already entered Chu Feng’s dantian.

Even if he wanted to hand it to them, it was already impossible for him to do so.

“Zzzzz~~~”

Right at that moment, a flash of light flew over from the distant sky.

Once that item appeared, heaven and earth started crumbling, and everything shattered. The surrounding space turned into primal chaos. In the terrifying pitch-black darkness, a crimson ray of light was rapidly flying over.

That was a crimson sword.

That sword was so powerful that it was truly capable of utterly destroying heaven and earth.

Seeing that sword, even the expressions of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster changed enormously.

They both felt an enormous threat from that crimson sword.

However, that crimson sword was not aimed at either the Wind Lightning Sword Sect’s sectmaster or the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain’s headmaster. Rather, it was flying straight at the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

“Foolishness.”

Facing that terrifying crimson sword, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted not only did not have any fear on his face, but he instead smiled mockingly.

He raised his arm, aimed his palm at the crimson sword, and shook it.

“Buzz~~~”

The thousand-meter-long crimson sword bringing destruction everywhere it passed actually stopped in midair. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Even though the crimson sword was still trembling violently and roaring like a herd of beasts, it was unable to move forward.

It was as if the crimson sword had been stopped by an invisible bastion.

“What’s going on?”

“Could it be, it’s the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted?”

Seeing the overwhelmingly powerful crimson sword that was unable to move forward, the crowd felt puzzled.

Because of that, they all turned their gazes to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

Even though the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted did not display any might, so much so that even his cultivation’s aura was still concealed, his movement made the crowd realize that it was very possibly him who had stopped that terrifying crimson sword.

Of course, this was merely the crowd’s guess. They could not be certain, since the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted did not show any signs of him releasing his power.

At the moment when the crowd were confused, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted suddenly shouted, “Break!”

Then, his clothes fluttered and a powerful aura swept forth, covering the surroundings.

At that moment, everyone could sense the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted’s cultivation.

Rank four Utmost Exalted. The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was also a rank four Utmost Exalted.

Most importantly, following his loud shout, he not only released his aura and oppressive might, but the powerful crimson sword actually began to crumble.

In the blink of an eye, the mighty crimson sword turned into countless crimson fragments that scattered down from the sky.

Even the shattered space returned to normal.

“This old guy, he...”

Seeing the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted and how powerful he was, the expressions of even the leaders of the five great powers’ became complicated.

As fellow rank four Utmost Exalteds, they were all able to sense how powerful that crimson sword was.

They all felt that crimson sword to be a thorny problem to take on. Yet, it had effortlessly been resolved by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.

Because of that, they realized that even though they were all rank four Utmost Exalted, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted still possessed stronger battle power than them.

Just when the crowd were all astonished by how powerful the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was, he began to mutter quietly. “I was originally planning to spare you.”

“Yet, you refused to value your life.”

“Since that’s the case, don’t think about leaving here safely.”

Then, he waved his sleeve, and boundless attractive power was released from his cuff

That attractive power immediately brought forth violent gales. Not only were the sand and rocks moving, but even the clouds were being sucked into his sleeve.

One thing worthy of mentioning was that even though that attractive power was extremely powerful, the crowd were not affected by it.

Yet, two figures appeared in the distant sky.

They seemed to have been captured by the attractive power. No matter how they struggled, they were unable to break free.

Frantically trying to escape, they were rapidly pulled from far away into the crowd’s field of view.

It turned out that those two people were Zhao Hong and Han Xiu, who had left earlier.
