Chapter 3430 - The Woman Before One’s Eyes

Above a certain lake in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, a golden ray of light suddenly appeared from the sky and landed on the surface of the lake.

In the blink of an eye, that region was completely covered by the brilliant light.

Not only was the light very dazzling, but it also emitted a sacred aura. It was as if a deity had descended upon the region.

However, the light rapidly waned after its appearance. Soon... the region returned to the way it had always looked.

At that moment, there stood a figure on the lake.

As for that person, it was none other than Chu Feng. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Feng had been brought here by the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.

However, at that moment, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak had disappeared from Chu Feng’s body.

Finally, Chu Feng had regained his freedom.

“The situation is truly bad. I’ve ended up offending the two seniors.”

“Say, Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, exactly what are you trying to do? Are you trying to deliberately put me in danger?”

Chu Feng felt helpless. He also understood that publicly rejecting Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan would cause the two of them to lose a lot of face.

As for those two seniors, they were individuals that cared deeply about their face.

Otherwise, the two of them wouldn’t have made so many continuous voice transmissions to Chu Feng so as to probe him to find out whether or not he would accept their invitation to take him as their disciple.

Unfortunately, Chu Feng was unable to even speak. He was unable to directly refuse the two of them even if he wanted to.

Ultimately, under the control of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, Chu Feng had pushed the two of them into a very embarrassing situation.

“Forget it. As it has already happened, I’ll think of a way to explain things to the two seniors when I return.”

Chu Feng shook his head helplessly. Then, he turned his gaze to his palm.

“Where’s the imprint?”

However, upon looking, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously.

Chu Feng clearly remembered the World Spiritist Immortal King leaving behind an ancient imprint on his palm in that dream.

The World Spiritist Immortal King had said that, with that imprint, Chu Feng could enter the Seven Realms Scared Mansion, and no one would dare to stop him.

Chu Feng had thought that, after he became stronger in the future. he could use the imprint to enter the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to rescue his mother.

But... why would the imprint suddenly disappear?

Chu Feng began to use all sorts of abilities to observe his palm. However, even after he used his Heaven’s Eyes to observe his palm, he was still unable to find the imprint.

It was as if the imprint had completely disappeared from his palm.

“What’s going on?”

“Could it be... that it was only a dream?”

Chu Feng started frowning, and began to ponder.

“Wuu~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng revealed an expression of pain. His painful expression grew more and more intense.

Chu Feng grabbed his chest tightly and half-squatted onto the ground.

“Damn it! This sensation, could it be a backlash?”

“Sure enough, the power of those black flames is not so easily obtained.”

Chu Feng soon realized that the sudden pain that had emerged from his chest and quickly engulfed his entire body should be the backlash from the black flames.

Discovering that the situation was bad, Chu Feng immediately took out three medicinal pellets and tossed them into his mouth. Then, he released his spirit power and covered his body with it.

Chu Feng was trying to alleviate the intensity of the backlash.

However, the intensity of the backlash was much more frightening than he had anticipated.

Chu Feng soon discovered that his spirit power had started to dissipate. It was as if his mental strength had been sealed, causing him to become unable to connect with his spirit power.

“This backlash is actually sealing my spirit power?”

“Wuuu~~~”

The backlash grew more and more intense. Chu Feng soon became unable to resist the backlash, and lost consciousness.

With a ‘putt,’ Chu Feng, who was floating on the surface of the lake, fell into the water.

Although Chu Feng had lost consciousness, the pain from the backlash continued to torment him.

Like being trapped in a nightmare, Chu Feng continued to be tormented by the backlash.

Being in such a situation, Chu Feng forgot the passage of time, forgot everything. He could only feel the unceasing pain that continued to attack him.

He felt as if he had fallen into hell, and was unable to struggle free.

It was unknown how much time had passed before the pain of the backlash started to wane. As the pain from the backlash started to lessen, Chu Feng began to regain his consciousness.

Finally, Chu Feng opened his eyes.

“Who are you?”

However, upon opening his eyes, Chu Feng discovered that he was lying on the ground.

Most importantly, a woman was standing before him. That woman was looking right at him from a very close distance.

Chu Feng was shocked to discover an enormous face looking straight at him upon opening his eyes after being tortured by the backlash.

Thus, he instinctively stood up, and looked at the woman with an alert expression.

“Why did you suddenly shout like that? You’ve frightened this lady, okay?”

Chu Feng’s sudden cry of alarm seemed to have frightened the woman, as she directly soared into the sky to hide herself. Only then did she turn around and stare at Chu Feng with a furious gaze.

“Hey, I only rescued you after discovering that you were floating on the surface of the lake and not breathing. Don’t you think that I was trying to harm you, okay?”

“If you don’t trust me, check for yourself. I have not touched a single possession of yours,” the woman said.

At that moment, Chu Feng began to observe his surroundings. Upon doing so, he discovered he was standing at the shore of the lake that he had fallen into earlier.

What that woman said should be true. She had not deceived him.

Thus, Chu Feng began to carefully size the young woman up.

Although the woman definitely did not save him, she had pulled him out of the water, and did not steal his Cosmos Sack. This meant that she was truly trying to help him, and was not a bad person.

“This girl?”

After examining the girl closely, Chu Feng’s gaze became complicated.
