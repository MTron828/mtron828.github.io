Chapter 3363 - Forging A Title Plate

“Milord, in that case, this junior has a matter to ask,” Chu Feng said

“Speak away,” Wuming Fenghuo said.

“I know that there will be people that will want to bring about my ruin. However, I feel that you are not one of them. Milord, is what this Chu Feng thinking correct?” Chu Feng looked to Wuming Fenghuo with a serious expression.

Once Chu Feng said those words, all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen turned silent.

Although they didn’t say anything, they all became extremely nervous. They were so nervous that they did not even dare to breathe loudly. Instead, they were staring at Wuming Fenghuo cautiously.

The reason for their reaction was because Chu Feng’s question was simply too sharp.

At that moment, they felt as if even the air had frozen.

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen were extremely afraid. They feared that Wuming Fenghuo would provide them with a different answer from what they hoped to hear.

Finally, Wuming Fenghuo answered.

“Of course.”

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen all heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing Wuming Fenghuo’s answer.

“While I do not know about other people, I personally wish for you, a sharp blade, to continue to grow.”

“I hope for you to become a sharp blade capable of protecting our Ancestral Martial Starfield. I hope that... you will become a sharp blade that is capable of fighting for our Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

After Wuming Fenghuo finished saying those words, he turned around and walked away. Soon after, he disappeared into the distance.

Wuming Fenghuo had left. He did not even give the Chu Heavenly Clansmen the chance to see him off.

As for Chu Feng, he had confirmed a guess of his.

Chu Feng had believed the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to be his enemies because they had attempted to eliminate his father.

However, Wuming Fenghuo was not Chu Feng’s enemy.

Even though he had refused to assist the Wuma Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng still felt that Wuming Fenghuo should be a good man.

However, that was only for now. Chu Feng’s goal was to defeat the Starfield Master Realm and have their Chu Heavenly Clan gain control over the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

He would inevitably battle the Starfield Master Realm.

“Chu Feng, you have truly grown daring. Even if Lord Wuming Fenghuo is different from others of the Starfield Master Realm, you will inevitably provoke his anger if you continue to contradict him like that.”

“That’s right. Chu Feng, no matter what, he is someone from the Starfield Master Realm. In the future, if you are to encounter others from the Starfield Master Realm, you must absolutely not act this way.”

Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others walked up to Chu Feng and warned him after Wuming Fenghuo left.

“You all are truly cowardly. What is there to fear about that person?”

Seeing the Chu Heavenly Clansmen with lingering fear written all across their face, Bai Liluo spoke disapprovingly, and cast a disdainful glance at them.

“The hell do you know?” The Chu Heavenly Clansmen cast side-eyes at Bai Liluo. Unconcealable disgust was present in their eyes.

Even if Bai Liluo had managed to awaken their Lord Clan Chief with her antidote, it didn’t keep them from having an unfavorable impression of her.

After all, the one who had poisoned their Lord Clan Chief was her as well. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Seniors, there is one thing that I need to explain to everyone.”

“The one who poisoned Lord Clan Chief is not big sis Liluo.”

“Due to certain things that have happened in the past, there’s another consciousness within her body. That consciousness is filled with hostility toward me. That is why it decided to cooperate with Chu Hanqing and the others.”

“Thus, that matter is unrelated to big sister Liluo,” Chu Feng immediately explained, after he noticed the hostility the Chu Heavenly Clansmen had toward Bai Liluo.

He knew that if he did not explain things for her, she would not bother to provide an explanation. With her nature, she simply did not care what the Chu Heavenly Clansmen thought of her.

However, Chu Feng hoped that Bai Liluo would be able to interact with the Chu Heavenly Clansmen peacefully.

“So that’s the case.”

“Miss Liluo, we have wronged you earlier. We hope that you do not take offense to it.”

Upon finding out the truth, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen immediately apologized to Bai Liluo.

“That said, Miss Liluo, is that other consciousness currently being temporarily suppressed by you, or has it been eliminated? Could it...?”

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen became very worried. After all, the fact that there was another consciousness within Bai Liluo meant great danger.

“You all can rest assured. This young lady has already suppressed it. Soon, its consciousness will completely disappear. It will no longer do anything to harm you all,” Bai Liluo said.

The Chu Heavenly Clansmen all heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing those words.

“Lord Clan Chief, are you alright?!!!”

Suddenly, a worried cry was heard.

It turned out that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had lost consciousness again.

Seeing this, all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen gathered beside the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief worriedly, and began to diagnose his condition.

“You all do not have to worry. His poison has already been removed. It’s merely that his health is very weak.”

“He should be properly resting. However, for the sake of requesting that guy’s help, he became too emotional. That is why he ended up falling unconscious. As long as he is given a period of proper rest, he will recover completely,” Bai Liluo said.

What Bai Liluo said was true. Upon diagnosing the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s condition, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen discovered that the poison had been completely removed. At that moment, he had merely fallen unconscious because his health was too weak.

“Seniors, it seemed that the title plate on Lord Wuming Fenghuo’s waist was somewhat peculiar. Is that a special sort of title plate?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng had seen some people from the Starfield Master Realm. However, he discovered that Wuming Fenghuo, Wuming Gangxiong and the other people from the Starfield Master Realm all had title plates that differed to some degree.

“Chu Feng, that is the title plate of one of the Ten Great Experts. It is naturally special.”

“That title plate represents the Ten Great Experts. Seeing the title plate is akin to seeing the individuals. If someone possesses the title plate, not only will it grant them protection, but it will also grant them the power to dispatch people from the Starfield Master Realm to deter others from the Ancestral Martial Starfield,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“In that case, how does one determine if the title plate is real or not? Is there some sort of special verification method?” Chu Feng asked.

“Of course there is. If there wasn’t a special verification method, and someone were to forge such a title plate, it would definitely cause chaos throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“Senior, could you tell me the method to verify the title plate in detail?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Xuanzhengfa began to explain the method to verify the Starfield Master Realm’s Ten Great Experts’ title plates to Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, why are you asking this? You must not try to forge a fake title plate. If the people from the Starfield Master Realm are to discover that someone attempted to forge a fake title plate, they will be caught and killed,” Chu Hanpeng said.

“Chu Feng, what Lord Supreme Elder said is very true. You must not mess around.”

At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa suddenly realized that Chu Feng might have some sort of motive for asking about it.

Chu Feng’s personality was a bold one. They were truly afraid that he would attempt to forge a fake title plate.

“Lord Supreme Elder, Senior Zhengfa, distinguishing the Starfield Master Realm’s title plates is common knowledge for everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Even people of the younger generation are capable of distinguishing them.”

“As such, I naturally should know how to distinguish them too. Otherwise, if someone is to take this title plate out in the future and I fail to distinguish it, wouldn’t I be placed in a very awkward situation?” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“That is true.”

“However, the people of the Starfield Master Realm will generally not wait for others to verify their title plates. Generally, they will directly release the power of their title plates,” Chu Xuanzhengfa said.

“That suits the character of the people from the Starfield Master Realm,” Chu Feng laughed.

After all, the people from the Starfield Master Realm were all arrogant and egotistical. How could they wait for others to question their validity?

Naturally, they would reveal a bit of their power from the very start so as to display their status and cow others.

However, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others had no idea that Chu Hanpeng’s worry was right on the mark.

Chu Feng had asked them about all it because he wanted to forge a title plate.
