Chapter 5478: The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief Appears

Long Chengyu proceeded to tell Chu Feng the old man’s background.

The old man was Long Shengjun, the only grand elder of the Totem Dragon Clan. He was from the same generation as the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief from two generations ago, which meant that he ranked high in terms of seniority.

Long Shengjun’s wife and offspring had died in a battle, but he later discovered that he still had a son left in the world, and he was none other than the black-haired elder, Long Ping’an.

He had taken the helm of the Totem Dragon Clan for a period of time right after the previous clan chief passed away, but he chose not to officially take over the position. Quoting his words, he had already competed with the previous clan chief for that position and failed, so he had no intention of fighting with the later generations over it.

Long Shengjun was also a highly powerful cultivator whose strength rivaled the current Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. That, with his standing and domineering personality, made him widely feared within the clan. Even the current Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief had to tread carefully around him, so it was no wonder Long Xu and Long Chengyu were afraid of dealing with him.

Long Shengjun was known to be highly protective of the Totem Dragon Clan’s interests, and he wouldn’t hesitate to come to blows with other powerhouses over it.

Due to that, Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were worried that Long Shengjun would harm Chu Feng after learning about what had happened.

So, the two of them brought Chu Feng to a highly resilient underground palace constructed out of treasure. To avoid drawing attention to this place, Long Chengyu and Long Muxi chose not to linger in the vicinity, leaving Chu Feng alone in the underground palace.

“Chu Feng, why don’t we just escape from here?” Eggy suggested worriedly.

She knew that Chu Feng was in a vulnerable position against the Totem Dragon Clan. Even if not for Long Shengjun and the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors, there were still plenty of powerful cultivators who could kill him. There was also no guarantee that Chu Feng’s protective formation would work if someone as powerful as Long Shengjun was after his life.

Besides, they could always tap into the Totem Dragon Clan’s clan protection formation if anything truly went awry.

Without a doubt, Chu Feng was in an absolutely disadvantageous position here.

All of a sudden, a person suddenly appeared in the underground palace. It was a well-built, middle-aged man who stood at around two meters and gave off an air of masculinity. He was dressed in exquisite golden armor and a cape, which made him look graceful and imposing.

This middle-aged man commanded the airs of a true ruler. Even without exerting his oppressive might, he felt as intimidating as the grand elder. He first assessed Chu Feng before asking, “Are you Chu Feng?”

Chu Feng quickly replied with a respectful bow, “Junior Chu Feng pays respect to the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.”

He was certain that the middle-aged man was Long Chengyu and Long Muxi’s father, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief. Given the other party’s appearance and disposition, it was hard to think of anyone else who fitted the profile.

The Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was visibly surprised.

Bam!

The doors to the underground palace abruptly opened, and Long Chengyu and Long Muxi anxiously barged in.

In Long Chengyu’s hand was a pearl that shared a similar aura as the underground chamber, but it was flickering with a red light. That was likely a warning that someone had trespassed into the underground palace, prompting them to anxiously rush over to take a look.

“Lord Father, you’re back. I was wondering who it was. It’s great that you’re back!”

Long Chengyu’s eyes visibly lit up upon seeing the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, and he rushed forward to his father’s side.

In contrast, Long Muxi froze in place with a complicated look on her face.

“Muxi, you’re back,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said with a smile.

His expression was calm as if this was a normal meeting between a father and his daughter.

“Mm,” Long Muxi placidly replied. She looked much more nervous in comparison.

“Calm down, I only have some questions I need to ask young friend Chu Feng. I don’t intend to hurt him. Wait outside for a moment,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Both Long Chengyu and Long Muxi obediently walked out, knowing that their father was a man of his word. If he said that he wouldn’t hurt Chu Feng, he definitely wouldn’t do so.

As soon as the two of them were gone, the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief looked at Chu Feng with an approving smile. “You’re indeed an extraordinary young man. You aren’t panicking in the least despite knowing who I am.”

“I didn’t panic because I didn’t think that Lord Clan Chief would harm me,” Chu Feng replied.

“What makes you so certain?”

“I don’t sense any enmity from Lord Clan Chief.”

“Your gut feeling is quite accurate,” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said with a chuckle. “You need not address me in such a formal manner. It’s rare for Chengyu and Muxi to be so fond of a person. You can call me ‘elder’ instead.”

“All right. Elder, may I know what you’d like to ask me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, you have to answer my question honestly. Are you really from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?” the Totem Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked with a grim expression. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
