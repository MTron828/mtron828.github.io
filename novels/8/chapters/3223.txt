Chapter 3223 - Parting Ways

“Do not use martial power or weapons. Use your hands to retrieve them.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he extended his hand and moved toward an ore to pick it up. Sure enough, he actually managed to easily extract a piece.

Witnessing that scene, the crowd reacted as if they’d gone mad. One by one, they extended their hands and began to pick out the ores.

At that moment, the vile nature of martial cultivators was revealed. The crowd were all frantically scrambling over the ores there.

Had it not been for the fact that it was Chu Feng who brought them to that place and that they were giving him face, there would definitely be people that would directly attack to suppress those weaker than them and monopolize the cultivation resources.

Seeing the crowd acting like that, Chu Feng felt that he could only help them with this much.

Thus, Chu Feng did not continue to collect the ores there and looked toward the crowd. He said, “Everyone, please stop what you all are doing.”

At that moment, the crowd were all filled with greed. If it was someone else who had called for them to stop what they were doing, they would not only not listen to that person, and they would likely attack that person instead.

However, as the person who had called out to them was Chu Feng, the crowd obediently stopped what they were doing regardless of how unwilling they were.

“Brother Chu Feng, what’s wrong?”

“Young master Chu Feng, do you need something?”

The crowd all began to question Chu Feng. Their tones were still as good-mannered as before.

“Everyone, listen to me. The cultivation resources here all belong to you all. Our Chu Heavenly Clan will not fight over them with you.”

“However, I hope that you will understand that I, Chu Feng, have brought you all here because we stand in the same boat. To put it briefly, we should be considered to be allies.”

“Thus, I don’t care if you all plan to hide here and lie low later on, or continue to search for other cultivation resources, it’s your own decision.”

“However... I hope that everyone here will not fight against one another for the sake of cultivation resources. Even if you all plan to fight, I hope that you will direct your attacks at the Linghu Heavenly Clan.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“If you are to attack the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, I, Chu Feng, will admire you. However, if you are to attack the people here, then I, Chu Feng, will look down on you,” Chu Feng said.

“Brother Chu Feng, you can rest assured. We are already like a family. We will definitely not massacre one another.”

“That’s right. Brother Chu Feng, you can rest assured.”

The crowd all began to express to Chu Feng that they would not massacre each other.

Seeing this, Chu Feng waved his hand and planned to bring Chu Qing, Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu to leave this place.

Chu Feng had revealed a place with cultivation resources to those people. Furthermore, that place was very well hidden, and relatively abundant with cultivation resources. As such, Chu Feng could be said to have been extremely benevolent and dutiful.

Thus, Chu Feng no longer planned to continue to look over those people. Regardless of whether they lived or died, they would no longer be Chu Feng’s concern.

Actually, Chu Feng felt that if those people were to continue to hide there properly and wait till the time arrived, they would definitely be able to leave the Holy Spirit Formation of Light safely.

However, if they were not satisfied with only the cultivation resources there, and still wished to seek out more cultivation resources, they would have to undertake a risk corresponding to their ambitions.

Chu Feng was neither a friend nor a relative to them. As such, he had no reason to concern himself with them anymore.

With the guidance from the power of the Holy Spirit Beast, Chu Feng had gained the knowledge of the location of the vast majority of the cultivation resources here. The place Chu Feng had brought the crowd to was actually a medium-tier cultivation resource site.

And now, Chu Feng was planning to bring Chu Qing and the others to a place with even greater cultivation resources.

Seeing that Chu Feng was planning to leave, a woman immediately spoke to ask him, “Young master Chu Feng, are you leaving?”

“You need something?” Chu Feng asked.

“Young master Chu Feng, may I continue to follow you?” That woman asked.

Seeing that woman asking that question, many others present also cast their longing gazes toward Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had already revealed his capabilities to the crowd. Following Chu Feng would not only guarantee their safety, but it would also guarantee that they would obtain even more cultivation resources. As such, the crowd would naturally all want to follow Chu Feng.

“No, that wouldn’t do. All of you can only rely on yourselves now,” Chu Feng said. His attitude was very firm, and even somewhat cold. However, the crowd all understood that it was only reasonable.

There was no reason for Chu Feng to continue to take care of them.

As such, the crowd did not have any intention to blame Chu Feng, and also did not continue to nag him.

“Young master Chu Feng, in that case, could you inform us as to how to use these ores?” That woman asked.

“That’s right. Brother Chu Feng, how do we use these ores?” The others present also began to question Chu Feng.

Although they could only pluck the ores with their hands, it remained that they were all martial cultivators.

With their keen agility, the crowd had all gathered a large quantity of ores in a short period of time.

However, although the ores contained a great amount of cultivation resources, the crowd discovered that they were actually unable to refine them.

This caused them to panic slightly. If they could not refine the ores, then no matter how many they plucked, it would all be useless.

“Those ores will transform. Currently, they are still sealed. As such, it’s naturally impossible to refine them. I believe their seals will soon be undone. At that time, you should all be able to use them,” Chu Feng said.

“Thank you, young master Chu Feng, for your advice,” hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd all revealed smiles of contentment.

As for Chu Feng, he no longer hesitated. His body shifted. A splash was made, and then he disappeared.

At the same time, Chu Qing and the other newcomers from the Chu Heavenly Clan also all disappeared. Chu Feng had brought them away with him.

As Chu Feng’s speed was extremely fast, the crowd were all unable to tell which direction Chu Feng left in.

Thus, after being startled momentarily, the crowd once again threw themselves into a frantic scramble over the ores.

Although the scramble for the ores inevitably led to conflicts, perhaps due to their promise to Chu Feng, the crowd would at the very most verbally argue with one another, and did not fight against one another.
