Chapter 2609 - Old Ancestor Of The Buddha’s Heavenly Temple

Not long after Ying Mingchao and the others returned to Hero City, the Immortal Sword School’s Headmaster and Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s Abbot both arrived at Hero City.

After various investigations, they were all certain that the Infant Soul Sect was not bluffing with their invitations.

Furthermore, their invitations were not only sent to the major powers; practically all of the powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm had received the invitation.

Their action was undoubtedly announcing their existence to the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Furthermore, they were using the name of ‘cultivation grand ceremony’ to invite everyone.

At this moment, Ying Mingchao and the others were all confused. They did not know exactly what the Infant Soul Sect was planning.

However, one thing was certain. Based on their understanding of the Infant Soul Sect, the Infant Soul Sect’s invitation was most definitely not as simple as it appeared.

In the end, the allied army decided to stake everything in one attack. They gave up defending their cities and gathered all of their strongest battle forces to directly attack the Infant Soul Sect. Victory or defeat would be determined by this one battle.

Currently, the strongest allied army was gathered in Hero City. This army, composed of people from Hero City, Buddha’s Heavenly Temple, the Immortal Sword School and many tier two powers, began to proceed toward the Infant Soul Sect’s headquarters. The Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s various other powers also began to proceed toward the Infant Soul Sect.

Although their speed was much inferior to that of the allied army, they set off toward the Infant Soul Sect much sooner than the allied army.

These were all people that did not know the truth. They had never heard of the Infant Soul Sect before.

The sudden invitation made some of them felt that it was fortune falling from the sky. As for others, they felt that this was merely a scam.

That said, regardless of how they felt, regardless of how skeptical they might be, they all decided to check things out.

After all, this was something that concerned their cultivation. None of them wished to miss this opportunity.

A magnificent army with thousands of men and horses was proceeding with countless war banners. It was a truly imposing sight.

Among them were enormous war chariots. Those war chariots were actually crushing the air as they moved. They were truly impressive.

Those that were capable of being inside those war chariots were most definitely people that possessed grand status.

Among them was Chu Feng.

Chu Feng was receiving the highest treatment from the allied army. The war chariot that he was in was reserved for the strongest individuals in the allied army.

Apart from Chu Feng, everyone else here were True Immortals. Among them was Zhao Hong.

However, as Zhao Hong was not fond of of this sort of setting, she had left the war chariot. Seeing that Zhao Hong had not returned for a long time, Chu Feng planned to go out to find her. However, right when he was planning to find Zhao Hong, he came across a familiar figure.

It was Grandmaster Pocket. Grandmaster Pocket was standing at the fringe of the allied army and looking forward.

Chu Feng walked toward Grandmaster Pocket and asked, “Grandmaster, why aren’t you resting in a war chariot?”

Although Grandmaster Pocket was not a True Immortal, he was a peak Martial Ancestor. Someone like him possessed the status to rest in a war chariot.

“Amitabha, it is rare that the various powers have decided to join hands to fight. Furthermore, they are doing so with the righteous intention to eliminate evil. As such, this old man wishes to feel the current situation,” Grandmaster Pocket said.

Chu Feng was able to understand what he meant by ‘rare.’

After all, the various powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm all possessed their own selfish motives. To join hands to clear a remnant was something that happened very frequently. However, that was because they all possessed their own selfish motives.

Thus, a battle like this, a battle with an identical objective, was truly rare.

For the sake of traveling as fast as possible, Ying Mingchao was using his power to speed up the overall speed of the group.

Thus, regardless of whether it might be the people in the war chariots or the people outside, their traveling speeds were all identical. It was not exhausting for the crowd to travel.

“Grandmaster, this junior has one thing that I wish to consult Grandmaster on,” Chu Feng said.

“What is it?” Grandmaster Pocket asked.

“It’s regarding the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s Founder,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng had indirectly questioned others about the founder of the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple before.

The founder of the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple was a person with the buddhist name Foguang. However, although this Abbot Foguang was the founder of the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple, his cultivation didn’t seem very high. Furthermore, he died not long after founding the Temple.

[1.Foguang means Buddha’s teachings. It is also the ‘Buddha’ in Buddha’s Heavenly Temple. In other words, Buddha’s Heavenly Temple could also be said to be Foguang’s Heavenly Temple.]

The Buddha’s Heavenly Temple had only emerged in power many years after Foguang died. That said, it was a mystery as to how the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple managed to emerge in power.

The reason why Chu Feng was inquiring about this was because he wanted to inquire about that mysterious old cat.

After all, that old cat had declared itself to be the founder of the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple.

That said, Chu Feng felt that it would be impossible for that old cat to be the founder of the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple, Monk Foguang. He felt that the old cat was most likely related to how the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple emerged in power.

“So that’s what you wanted to know.”

“Naturally, the founder of our Buddha’s Heavenly Temple is Abbot Foguang. That is something that everyone knows,” After saying those words, Grandmaster Pocket smiled profoundly. Then, he said to Chu Feng, “I believe that is what Almsgiver Chu Feng wanted to know, no?”

Chu Feng noticed that a soundproofing spirit formation had quietly covered the two of them as Grandmaster Pocket said those words.

In other words, the conversation between the two of them could not be heard by others from this point on.

Seeing that Grandmaster Pocket had seen through him, Chu Feng did not try to beat around the bush anymore either. Instead, he directly asked, “Grandmaster, what I wanted to know is the person that helped the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple emerge in power.”

“I knew that’s what you wanted to ask about. That’s understandable too. After all, countless people want to know about that matter. However, that is a secret of our Buddha’s Heavenly Temple,” Grandmaster Pocket said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart sunk. Since it was their secret, it was clear that he would not be able to obtain any information today.

However, right at this moment, Grandmaster Pocket smiled and said, “However, Lord Abbot mentioned to us before that if you wanted to know about this matter, we could tell you about it. Merely, there is a condition. That is, you must keep this matter confidential.”

“This junior will definitely keep this matter confidential,” Chu Feng said.

“Speaking of it, you might find it unbelievable. Others must definitely think that it was an Upper Realm’s expert that helped our Buddha’s Heavenly Temple emerge in power. They must all think that it was an immortal and virtuous monk that helped us. Else, there would be no reason for them to confer a favor upon our temple.”

“However, the truth is, it was not a virtuous saint that helped our Buddha’s Heavenly Temple emerge in power. In fact, it could even be said that the individual that helped us was not a human either. Instead, it was a cat,” Grandmaster Pocket said.

“It’s a match! Sure enough, it is that old cat. Chu Feng, quickly ask him about that old cat,” Her Lady Queen spoke excitedly.

That old cat was too mysterious. Not only had it snatched away Zhan Haichuan’s inheritance, but it had also snatched away the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip. That old cat was extremely powerful and cunning.

Most importantly, that old cat had also abducted Xue Ji. No one knew what it planned to do.

Thus, both Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen wanted to know the origin of that old cat.

“Cat? Why would it be a cat? Could it be a monstrous beast?”

Even though Chu Feng had already met that old cat before, it was clear that the people from the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple had no idea about the interactions between Chu Feng and that old cat. As such, Chu Feng would naturally have to pretend that he had no idea about the old cat.

“That individual might be a monstrous beast, yet might also not be a monstrous beast. Regardless, it is extremely powerful. It is all thanks to it that our Buddha’s Heavenly Temple managed to obtain our current standing. Thus, our Buddha’s Heavenly Temple has always deemed it as our Old Ancestor,” Grandmaster Pocket said.

“Could it be that not even you all know of the origin of your Old Ancestor?” Chu Feng asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“It is merely a coincidence that we obtained the assistance of our Old Ancestor. As for our Old Ancestor’s origin, we know nothing of it. All we know is that our Old Ancestor came to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to seal an item,” Grandmaster Pocket said.

“Seal an item? What sort of item?” Chu Feng asked.

“We have no clue as to what that item is or where that item is sealed.”

“All we know is that our Old Ancestor mentioned that that item was not something from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. It was from the Outer World, and possessed an extremely bloodthirsty and cruel nature.”

“Our Old Ancestor told us that if that item were to break free from its seal, the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would fall into a calamity, and everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would be killed.”

“It would be an inescapable fate for the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Grandmaster Pocket said.
