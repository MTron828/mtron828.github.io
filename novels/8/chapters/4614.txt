Chapter 4614: Friendly Smile

Unlike the others, Chu Feng was not going for the beauty by the Asura Graveyard. As long as he could see the Asura Graveyard, he would immediately give up on it and walk away.

However, the situation seemed to be proceeding in a direction different from what he expected. It looked like they were going to fight it out instead.

“Elder, didn’t you say that I’ll be able to approach the Asura graveyard if I receive the slot to the matchmaking convention?”

Left with no choice, Chu Feng could only send a voice transmission to Dongfang Yunkong to ask about the matter.

In truth, he had tried asking Dongfang Yunkong about this matter while they were traveling here earlier, but the latter didn’t give him a response. As such, he didn’t bear much hope about receiving a response from Dongfang Yunkong.

He had already made up his mind here. If Dongfang Yunkong still wasn’t going to respond, he would just give up right away. He had no intention of getting beaten up here for no reason.

“Are you that interested in the Asura Graveyard?”

But to Chu Feng’s surprise, Dongfang Yunkong actually responded.

“Elder, to be honest with you, I have no interest in the matchmaking convention. I only competed for this slot because you told me that I’d get a chance to approach the Asura Graveyard. I’m truly interested in taking a look at the Asura Graveyard, so may I ask you if I’ll really get a chance to approach that place or not?”

Chu Feng revealed his own thoughts honestly.

There was a slight moment of silence before Dongfang Yunkong finally responded with a slightly reluctant voice.

“You should try your best to survive till the end then. You’ll have to prove your strength first before gaining the right to approach the Asura Graveyard. However, I should warn you that the Asura Graveyard isn’t necessarily a good place. It’s different from any other remnants you have been to. There were many who carried great curiosity for it, only to end up losing their lives. I advise you to think twice about the matter.”

After saying his piece, Dongfang Yunkong fell silent and no longer responded to Chu Feng’s questions anymore.

“Try my best to survive till the end? If it’s another trial, I might still be able to do it. However, if it’s a duel... I don’t think that I’ll stand a chance at all.”

Chu Feng knew that there were many stronger world spiritists than him here, such that he wouldn’t stand a chance if they were to go head-on against one another. However, if it was a test or something along that line, there was still some hope for him.

While Chu Feng was worrying over this, the platform above had finally finished constructing, and the Wretched Black Demon began speaking once more.

“Young friends, you’ll be put through a challenge. The winner of the challenge will be able to wed my granddaughter and obtain a huge present from me, which will be placed at the final location.

“For this challenge, you can only use your world spiritist techniques and your world spirits. You’re strictly forbidden from using your martial power. On top of that, I’ll be putting you all through a test prior to the challenge to gauge your true spirit power first.”

Right after saying those words, the Wretched Black Demon shot his gaze at one of the juniors of the Gongsun Clan. This junior had a handsome face and a distinguished disposition. In terms of appearances, he stood out even amongst the other six prodigies of the Gongsun Clan. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The fact that the Wretched Black Demon was paying attention to him left the crowd curious to find out just what that junior of the Gongsun Clan was capable of.

“Of course, this test is conducted out of my personal interest. It won’t affect the results of your challenge later on. We, world spiritists, are different from cultivators. While your level of spirit power will aid you greatly in the challenge, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee you a good result.

“Let’s start with that young friend over there then!”

The Wretched Black Demon turned his eyes toward Xiao Yu. There was a slight gleam in his eyes that seemed to show that he carried great expectations for the latter.

Xiao Yu calmly bowed toward the Wretched Black Demon first before leaping up onto the elevated platform in front.

Weng!

As soon as Xiao Yu landed on the elevated platform, the elevated platform began to glow brilliantly. A surge of light manifested into the form of a dragon, which rose from the ground and coiled around Xiao Yu.

This elevated platform appeared to work in a similar manner to the Dragon Disclosure Stone, allowing one to test a world spiritist’s true prowess.

Of course, there was no way Xiao Yu’s result would stop with just a single dragon.

After the emergence of the first light dragon, another three more burst forth one after another.

Rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation. This was the extent of Xiao Yu’s strength.

A huge commotion broke out amidst the spectator gallery after seeing the results on the elevated platform. At rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation, Xiao Yu did possess the strength to defeat the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.

However, they were only surprised because Xiao Yu was an unfamiliar name to them. They couldn’t help but be curious as to where this highly talented junior had come from.

The next one to step on the elevated platform after Xiao Yu was Xia Yan. He, too, was at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation.

However, perhaps the crowd had already gotten used to it after Xia Yan’s precedence, there wasn’t the initial hype anymore. Most of the crowd simply nodded their heads slightly in acknowledgment.

It was Chu Feng’s turn next.

To be honest, he didn’t want to do this test if he had a choice because he knew that it was going to be awkward. However, he had no choice here. In order to get a chance to approach the Asura Graveyard, he could only go along with the Wretched Black Demon’s wishes here.

With a deep sigh, he leaped onto the elevated platform.

Weng!

A brilliant light dragon burst forth and coiled itself around Chu Feng, and the second one quickly followed suit too.

The crowd at the spectator gallery didn’t have much of a reaction. They were waiting patiently for the third light dragon and possibly the fourth too to appear.

However, even after waiting for a while, the third light dragon didn’t appear.

While those in the crowd were exchanging confused gazes with one another, wondering if there was something wrong with the elevated platform, Chu Feng suddenly clasped his fist toward the Wretched Black Demon and the other world spiritists present before leaping down the stage.

It was only then that everyone realized what had just happened.

In an instant, an uproar that was even greater than when it was revealed that Xiao Yu was at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation broke out amidst the crowd.

“It can’t be that that fellow is only at rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation?”

All eyes fell on Chu Feng in the blink of an eye.

Being in the center of the limelight, Chu Feng could only respond with a friendly smile.
