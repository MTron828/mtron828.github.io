Chapter 5921: Find a Person For Me

“You have quite the temper. Do you know who I am?” the old voice inside the barrier asked.

“I don’t care who you are. I can spare them, but you have to hand over what I need,” Chu Feng replied.

“What is it?”

“Don’t feign ignorance. You might be physically trapped inside the barrier, but you can project your consciousness outside. I know you’re aware of everything that transpired since our arrival,” Chu Feng replied.

“You’re a smart one. You are quite sensitive toward barriers. You must be quite the prodigious world spiritist.”

“Let’s not waste words on the unnecessary and get to the main point.”

“Hahaha! Sure. What you want is that lad Tan Yu’s dantian, right? That dantian is with me, and I have no use for it. I can return it to you, but I have a condition.”

“What is it?”

“Find a person in my stead and bring him here. In return, I’ll give you Tan Yu’s dantian.”

That person inside the barrier tossed out a scroll through the crack.

Chu Feng caught the scroll and unfurled it. Zi Ling leaned over to take a look too. The content of the scroll surprised the two of them.

It was a portrait of Chu Feng!

“Why are you finding this person?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s none of your business. You just have to bring the person here,” that old voice replied.

“You’ll return Tan Yu’s dantian if I bring that person here?”

“That’s right.”

“How can I trust you?”

“I can breach this barrier by myself; I just need time. Once I breach it, you need not dream of retrieving Tan Yu’s dantian.”

“I doubt that. You are under a restriction formation that prevents you from the barrier. Otherwise, there’s no reason you can toss a scroll out but not leave the barrier,” Chu Feng replied with the scroll in hand.

“You are a smart one. Fine, I shall not beat around the bush anymore. Tan Yu’s dantian is indeed useless to me, but his plight means nothing to me. Bring Chu Feng to me, and I’ll return Tan Yu’s dantian to you. If you refuse to help me, I’ll ruin his dantian right now.”

“That’s easier said than done. Do you think it’ll be that easy to find Chu Feng? Why don’t you ask them about it?” Chu Feng glanced at those from the Sunmoon Sect.

“Chu Feng? Which Chu Feng?” The sectmaster and the others were confused.

“Take a look for yourself.” Chu Feng tossed the scroll over. At the same time, he removed his foot from the old ancestor’s head.

The old ancestor, the sectmaster, and the sectmaster’s grandson walked over to look at the portrait. They immediately narrowed their eyes.

“I-it’s him?”

“Milord, why are you looking for him?”

The three of them panicked.

Tan Yu was constantly plagued with pain, and he often passed out from being unable to bear the pain. He might have even missed Chu Feng’s name in the sky when the latter emerged as the champion of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. It was not surprising for him to not know anything about Chu Feng at all.

In contrast, those from the Sunmoon Sect were bound to know who Chu Feng was.

He was Jie Ranqing’s son, the inheritor of the Ruler’s Bloodline and an extremely powerful Heavenly Lightning Bloodline. He conquered the legendary power, Genesis Bloodline, and was titled the strongest junior in the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, even when his rivals included prodigies from the Ancient Era.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had been trying to capture him but to no avail. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Feng was one of the most terrifying monsters in the present world of cultivation! Little sects like theirs would never dare to cross him! Someone who didn’t fear the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was not to be trifled with.

“Wait, you know him too?” the old voice asked.

“We do. Of course, we do. How could we not know him?” the old ancestor said.

“He... is Chu Feng?” Tan Yu saw the portrait too, and he realized from the reactions of those from the Sunmoon Sect that Chu Feng was a formidable person.

The old ancestor proceeded to share Chu Feng’s exploits.

Even Tan Yu was awed.

He finally knew why Zi Ling had such high praises for Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s feats didn’t pale in comparison to his mother, Jie Ranqing.

The knowledge that Chu Feng was still a junior left him with goosebumps. He used to be a prodigy himself, which was why he understood just how earth-shattering Chu Feng’s feats were.

“I didn’t know there was such an incredible person in the world. As expected of Lord Jie Ranqing’s offspring,” Tan Yu remarked.

“Is Chu Feng truly Jie Ranqing’s child?” the old voice asked.

“When were you imprisoned here?” Chu Feng asked.

Someone from the Ancient Era shouldn’t have known about Jie Ranqing. It also didn’t make much sense for him to have learned about Jie Ranqing through the Sunmoon Sectmembers, considering that Chu Feng had been the focus of most discussions nowadays.

This also suggested that the entity trapped inside the barrier, despite having noticed the arrival of Chu Feng’s group, likely only gained the ability to project his consciousness out to spy on the Sunmoon Sect’s affairs in recent days, or else he should have heard about Chu Feng.

In other words, the entity hadn’t been trapped in the barrier for a long time.

“I told you not to probe into my affairs. My offer still stands. Get Chu Feng here, and I’ll return Tan Yu’s dantian to you. Also, if you do meet Chu Feng, tell him that meeting me will only have benefits for him,” the old voice said.

“What kind of benefits?” Chu Feng asked.

“I can’t tell you.”

“How can I convince Chu Feng if you don’t get to the bottom of it?”

“I concede on that, but it’s not convenient for me to reveal the information due to several reasons. In any case, just get Chu Feng here.”
