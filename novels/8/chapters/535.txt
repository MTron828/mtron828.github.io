MGA: Chapter 536 - History of the Sea Region

However, Chu Feng did not pay attention to the black-clothed old man’s words. He swallowed the Spirit Formation Essence in large mouthfuls and not only did he not have the slightest bit of a painful expression, instead, on his face, he even wore an expression of excitement.

As if the Spirit Formation Essence wasn’t even any poison, but the most delicious food in the world.

The most important thing was as the pond was consumed by Chu Feng bit by bit, his aura actually started to climb, and when the pond was one third consumed by Chu Feng, he broke through. From the 1st level of the Heaven realm, he entered the 2nd level of the Heaven realm.

Although Chu Feng did not make any more breakthroughs after that, he alone devoured all of the large pond’s Spirit Formation Essence, and did not leave even a single drop behind.

“Can it be that this brat is a monster?”

Personally seeing everything, the expression on the black-clothed old man’s face was truly as wonderful as it could get.

Although he had checked out Chu Feng’s body and discovered that there was special power surging within his blood, thus knowing his talent was extraordinary as he had a special body, and would definitely have quite some achievements in the future, he never would have thought that Chu Feng would be so abnormal and actually madly consumed the Spirit Formation Essence.

Spirit Formation Essence was an extremely horrifying thing! Normal people, if they took just a single drop, would die. Even people with high cultivation would be heavily injured, and a root of diseases would possibly be left behind, affecting their future development.

But Chu Feng, he actually fully consumed an entire pond of Spirit Formation Essence! How could the black-clothed old man not be shocked?

If he didn’t personally see it, he would have absolutely not believed that someone in the world could actually consume Spirit Formation Essence, and moreover, even cause cultivation to rise greatly because of that. It also meant that Chu Feng truly refined the Spirit Formation Essence, and did something that normal people could not do.

Recalling when he first saw Chu Feng, at his cultivation, then thinking he actually broke through in such a short period of time, he became aware of something inconceivable.

It was that Chu Feng’s potential was simply a lot more terrifying than he expected.

“I’m almost there. After refining all of the Spirit Formation Essence I saw when I came here, I should be able to break into the 3rd level of the Heaven realm.” Chu Feng wiped his mouth, and after taking in all the Spirit Formation Essence on the edges of his mouth, he smiled rather satisfiedly.

“Brat, come over. Quickly come over, I have something I want to discuss with you.” Suddenly, the black-clothed old man yelled loudly. On his aged face, excitement was filled.

“Senior, what’s the matter? Are you going to tell me things about that man?” Chu Feng lightly smiled and walked over, but he could only stand outside of the Four Symbols Binding Formation.

“Hehe, it is merely things about Huangfu Haoyue. If you want to know, naturally, I can tell you.”

“But before that, I need to ask you a question. Which power do you think is the strongest in the Eastern Sea Region?” The black-clothed old man smiling asked.

“To be honest, although I haven’t went to the Eastern Sea Region, I have heard that the strongest power in the Eastern Sea Region is the Immortal Execution Archipelago.”

“Ha! The Immortal Execution Archipelago, worthy of being the strongest power in the Eastern Sea Region?” However, just as Chu Feng finished speaking, the black-clothed old man spat out a large piece of phlegm with a face full of disdain.

“Senior, could it be that the Immortal Execution Archipelago isn’t the strongest power in the Eastern Sea Region?” Chu Feng curiously asked.

“Whatever, since it is destiny that brought us together, and I also know that sooner or later, you will go to the Eastern Sea Region, I’ll provide you with some knowledge about the Eastern Sea Region.”

“The strongest power in the Eastern Sea Region has never been any dog butt Immortal Execution Archipelago. Not before, not now. It’s my Crippling Night Demon Sect!” The black-clothed old man pleasedly said.

“Crippling Night Demon Sect?!” Chu Feng’s complexion changed. It was the first time he had heard of that name.

“That’s right. Under the command of my previous leaders, my Crippling Night Demon Sect has been titled as overlord of the Eastern Sea Region for countless years. Who could defeat us?!”

“However, because the most recent sect head died from Demonic Art cultivation failure, my Crippling Night Demon Sect split into pieces and endless internal conflicts arose.”

“But despite all of that happening, my Crippling Night Demon Sect is still the strongest power in the Eastern Sea Region. As long as my Crippling Night Demon Sect gathers together, it is still the overlord of the Eastern Sea Region.”

“And other than my Crippling Night Demon Sect, there’s also another power, and that’s the Burning Heaven Church Huangfu Haoyue belongs in.”

“This Burning Heaven Church is relatively low-profile, but it also has the ambition to name themselves as the overlord of the world. However, their ambitions were no longer in the Eastern Sea Region, so very rarely did they fight for fame and benefits. Thus, they also hadn’t have much conflicts with my Crippling Night Demon Sect.”

“But the Burning Heaven Church’s strength absolutely does not allow for any underestimation. Although they have very few members, they are the elites within elites.”

“Their disciple selection process is extremely harsh, as they have a screening system of choosing one person within ten thousand, and those ten thousand people are even people with extremely good aptitude.”

“From that, it can be seen how harsh the Burning Heaven Church chooses its members.”

“However, that did indeed form the legend, which says that the Burning Heaven Church is made out of only geniuses. Especially the historical Holy Sons and Holy Daughters. They were the strongest people within the Eastern Sea Region’s young generation.”

“That brat Huangfu Haoyue particularly. He can be said to be a genius whose name shocked the Eastern Sea Region, and had strength that surpassed the Pope before even inheriting the position of Pope.”

“Moreover, I heard a secret relating to Huangfu Haoyue.” Suddenly, the black-clothed old man’s tone became low and deep.

“What secret?” Chu Feng asked quickly.

“The Burning Heaven Church had high ambition, yet didn’t start conflicts against the world. The reason why I said it was inferior to my Crippling Night Demon Sect is because his Burning Heaven Church’s past Popes were indeed inferior to my sect’s head.”

“Even if the Burning Heaven Church’s Pope was stronger than my sect’s young head at their younger times, since my sect’s Demonic Arts needs time to mature, so when both of them succeed their grand positions, my sect’s heads were always superior, and they always got more and more powerful.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“However, Huangfu Haoyue was an abnormality. I heard my sect’s head say one thing to me before. It was that Huangfu Haoyue looked for him for a spar.”

“My sect’s head was the publicly recognized number one expert in the Eastern Sea Region, and even though Huangfu Haoyue’s development was flourishing, after all, he was in the young generation, so naturally, my sect’s head did not put him in his eyes. He originally wanted to give him some lessons so he wouldn’t be so wild.”

“But he could do nothing as with one fight, my sect’s head fought against Huangfu Haoyue for three days and three nights. At the end, the two of them were actually unable to determine the outcome, and ended up with a tie.”

“At that time, the age of my sect’s head neared a hundred, and he was at the period where the Demonic Arts were at their strongest.”

“Yet, Huangfu Haoyue just passed thirty years. So, my sect’s head said to me, that in a few more years, Huangfu Haoyue would definitely be able to defeat him.” Speaking to that point, a hint of sorrow emerged onto the black-clothed old man’s face.

Listening to that point, Chu Feng’s expression changed and he hurriedly asked, “Senior, from what you’ve said, doesn’t that mean Huangfu Haoyue is one of the strongest people in the Eastern Sea Region, and no one can threaten him?”
