Chapter 5936: A Familiar Face in the Netherworld Sect

“What’s going on? Is there a clash between experts in another realm? What’s with the huge ruckus?”

While assimilating the souls of the deceased, the fifteen people looked at the sky, drawn by the commotion on Littlelight Upper Realm. They didn't know what was happening there. 

None of them concealed their auras. The strongest one was only at rank three Half-God level, and five of them were at Martial Exalted level. They were unlikely to have a high standing in the Netherworld Sect, so Chu Feng didn't think they would have any clues about Little Fishy.

Thus, Chu Feng revealed himself and sneered, “You beasts still have the mood to chat after committing such atrocities?”

“Hoh, another one who doesn’t fear death. You don’t recognize our clothes?” one of the women stood up and asked.

Chu Feng didn’t reply. He first suppressed his aura to rank three Half-God level before unleashing the Lightning Mark to raise his cultivation to rank four Half-God level. He believed that this should be enough to deal with them.

He charged at the Netherworld Sectmembers with a formation saber.

The first thing he did was to stab the woman who just stood up and spoke. He twisted his blade and slashed the woman into two, causing blood to splatter around.

“I’ll slaughter you!” 

The other Netherworld Sectmembers were furious to see Chu Feng kill one of their allies. One of the rank three Half-God level cultivators raised his cultivation by a rank and whipped out his Exalted Armament in preparation to unleash an assault. 

However, Chu Feng sliced him into two with a slash.

He didn’t stand a chance against Chu Feng even though the two of them were at rank four Half-God level.

“This isn’t good. Run!”

The Netherworld Sectmembers couldn’t remain arrogant after witnessing Chu Feng’s ferocity. The surviving sectmembers rushed into the sky and attempted to escape. 

Chu Feng furiously swung his Exalted Armament and killed twelve other sectmembers with a slash each. However, one of the rank three Half-God level sectmembers raised his cultivation by a rank and managed to make a getaway. 

In truth, Chu Feng had intentionally let him off. Otherwise, there was no way a rank three Half-God level cultivator, even after raising his cultivation by a rank, could slip away from him. 

He first stowed away the bodies of the Netherworld Sectmembers he had killed to not draw unnecessary attention before tailing the escaped rank three Half-God level sectmember.

That sectmember led him toward a deep underground chamber. 

Hundreds of people were gathered inside the underground chamber, and their clothes indicated that they were from the Netherworld Sect too. All of them stood neatly by the side, while a short figure sat in the center seat.

“Bad news, milord. We encountered a barbarian who doesn’t fear our Netherworld Sect. He murdered Li Cang and the others!” the rank three Half-God level sectmember kneeled and reported. 

“Bastards! Why are you causing trouble at this juncture? Didn’t we tell you to be careful?”

The crowd berated the rank three Half-God level sectmember.

“Elders, what’s the point of lecturing him? Whoever dares offend our Netherworld Sect ought to be punished. Where is he?” the person seated at the center seat asked with the sweet voice of a woman that sounded incredibly familiar to Chu Feng.

“Lord Yun’er is right,” someone in the crowd concurred.

The name ‘Yun’er’ and the familiar voice reminded Chu Feng of a person—Song Yun. She and a little girl, who was likely the Darkness Monstrous God, were captured by a Netherworld Envoy back then. 

Thus, Chu Feng flew deeper inward. Before any of the Netherworld Sectmembers noticed anything, Chu Feng asked aloud with his original voice, “Song Yun, is that you?”

The person in the center seat immediately stood up and asked, “Big brother Chu Feng?”

She took off her white bamboo hat and revealed her true face. She was indeed Song Yun.

The rank three Half-God level sectmember who ran all here was too little dull-witted to grasp the relationship between Chu Feng and Song Yun despite the obvious hints, such that he pointed a finger at Chu Feng and exclaimed, “Milord, he’s the one who killed our people!”

A cold glint flashed across Song Yun’s eyes. She flicked her wrist, and a red dagger was hurtled across the underground chamber. 

By the time the red dagger returned to her hand, the underground chamber had already fallen deathly silent. Hundreds of Netherworld Envoys collapsed to the floor, with fresh blood seeping from their necks. 

They were all dead.

Song Yun had killed all of them. She was emanating a three-layered sinister but powerful aura, which raised her cultivation to rank nine Half-God level. 

When the three-layered aura receded, her cultivation reverted to rank six Half-God level. That was likely her base cultivation level. Astonishingly, her cultivation was advancing no slower than Chu Feng’s.

Despite having just killed hundreds of Netherworld Sectmembers, Song Yun merrily hopped up to Chu Feng as if nothing had happened. “Show me your true face. Let me have a good look at my big brother Chu Feng.”

Chu Feng stripped away his disguise and revealed his true appearance. 

Song Yun leaned even closer. Her eyes curled into crescents as she looked at Chu Feng with a sweet smile. “My big brother Chu Feng is indeed more soothing to the eye.”

“Will you be fine killing these people?” Chu Feng asked.

“So be it. It’s not as if anyone knows that I’m behind it. However, they mustn’t know that you killed someone from the Netherworld Sect, or else it could bring trouble upon you,” Song Yun said.

She turned around and directed her palm at the deceased Netherworld Sectmembers. A red mark appeared on her palm; it was a formation.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Red threads shot out of the formation and pierced through the deceased sectmembers.

Uwa!

Miserable cries echoed from the deceased sectmembers, sounding eerie. Chu Feng swiftly realized that the cries were coming from the Netherworld Embryos. 

All Netherworld Sectmembers had a Netherworld Embryo inside their body, but Song Yun had two of them fused. This was an incredible show of talent. It was precisely due to her achieving such a feat that the Netherworld Sect decided to nurture her. 

The cries from the Netherworld Embryos didn’t last long; they slowly faded away into oblivion.

Following that, Song Yun waved her sleeves and erased all of the deceased Netherworld Sectmembers’ bodies.

“Are you using them for your cultivation?” Chu Feng asked. 

“You can say so. Big brother Chu Feng, where are the people you killed? We shouldn’t waste them,” Song Yun said.

Chu Feng waved his sleeves and brought out the corpses of the Netherworld Sectmembers he had killed. 

“Taking away the victims of your corpses; as expected of my big brother Chu Feng. This works fine. It spares a lot of hassle.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Song Yun activated the formation on her palm once more and assimilated these people’s Netherworld Embryos too. When she was finally done, she turned her attention to Chu Feng. 

“Big brother Chu Feng, do you need their corpses?”

“I’ll keep them. I might need them,” Chu Feng said as he stowed the corpses away.

Song Yun formed a hand seal to conceal her palm formation. It was a thorough concealment.

“Were you already planning to kill these people? Even if I didn’t come, you would have still killed them, right?” Chu Feng asked.
