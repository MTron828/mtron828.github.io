Chapter 3675 - Crusade

“That’s hard to say.”

“If no other power decides to involve themselves in the matter, then, in terms of their respective strengths, it would naturally be the Starfield Master Realm that is stronger.”

“However, the Tantai Heavenly Clan, Jiaoli Heavenly Clan, Heavenly Reaching Beast Clan and Nightmare Spirit Clan are all very close to the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Likely, they’ve already joined hands.”

“As the war has only just begun, they still show no signs of movement. However, sooner or later, they will act. That is why it is hard to determine the outcome of this war,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“If that’s the case, things will become rather interesting,” The Monstrous Holy City’s City Master revealed a faint smile on her face.

She was not at all worried about the battle that concerned the future of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Instead, she felt it to be very amusing.

Her behavior was understandable. Regardless of whether it was the Linghu Heavenly Clan or the Starfield Master Realm that became the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they must still be respectful toward their Three Cities.

In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they, the Three Cities, did not fear anyone.

“Actually, I feel that the Linghu Heavenly Clan are rushing things. In terms of the talent of their younger generations, Linghu Hongfei is much stronger than Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo.”

“As time passes, this disparity will only increase.”

“Furthermore, I’ve heard that after Linghu Hongfei tied with Chu Feng, he returned to the Linghu Heavenly Clan and entered the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation.”

“And now, he has managed to successfully exit the Lightning-fire Bloodline Formation. With that, his cultivation will definitely increase greatly.”

“If the Linghu Heavenly Clan were to continue to patiently hold onto their ambitions until Linghu Hongfei matured, the Starfield Master Realm would definitely not be able to defend their position. There would simply be no need for them to do such a risky thing right now,” the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master said.

“Indeed, Linghu Hongfei had the greatest potential among all the people of the younger generations in the past.”

“However, that is the past. After Chu Feng appeared, the Linghu Heavenly Clan felt threatened,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It’s no wonder brother Long is willing to bring those mediocre people from the Chu Heavenly Clan into your Ancestral Martial Dragon City. So it’s actually because you took a fancy to that Chu Feng.”

“That said, what you’ve said is true. That brat Chu Feng’s potential is truly not to be looked down on.”

“Even though he is still incomparable to his father at the same age, his future accomplishments are inestimable,” When mentioning Chu Feng, the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master also revealed a look of appreciation.

“City master Long is not someone who would let emotions affect his decision. Your decision to offer shelter to the Chu Heavenly Clan is not purely because you fancy that Chu Feng, no?” Compared to the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master, the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master smiled profoundly.

“Oh?”

Hearing those words, the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master looked at the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master with a different sort of expression in his eyes.

Faced with the curious gazes from the two City Masters, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master smiled. He said, “That child holds great importance.”

“What importance?” asked the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master.

The Monstrous Holy City’s City Master was still looking at the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master with a curious gaze.

“Haha...”

Faced with the curious two, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master laughed profoundly. However, he didn’t answer their question.

“You’re actually beating around the bush now? If that’s the case, we will not be journeying with you. If you want to secretly protect Chu Feng, you can do it yourself,” said the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

“Who said I’m going to protect Chu Feng?”

“If I wanted to protect him, I could very well journey together with him and protect him in the open. There would be no need for me to follow him secretly,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“In that case, Brother Long, exactly what are you planning to do that you insist on having the two of us accompany you?” asked the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master.

“You’ve said it yourself earlier. Didn’t Linghu Hongfei exit the grand bloodline formation with a greatly increased cultivation?”

“Don’t you all know what sort of character Linghu Hongfei is? After suffering by Chu Feng’s hands in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, how could he possibly be willing to drop the matter?”

“Now that his cultivation has greatly increased, he will definitely make trouble for Chu Feng,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“You mean to say that Linghu Hongfei will head to the Chu Heavenly Clan to challenge Chu Feng?” asked the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

“Precisely,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“If that’s the case, I’ll really have to go and have a look. After all, that would be a very good show,” said the Divine Body Royal City’s City Master.

“The current Chu Feng is no match for Linghu Hongfei,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Indeed. Although Chu Feng’s cultivation has increased somewhat, it might still be inferior to Linghu Hongfei’s. If that’s the case, wouldn’t it mean that Chu Feng is toast?” said the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

“That’s not necessarily the case,” said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Could it be that you know something?” asked the Monstrous Holy City’s City Master.

However, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master only smiled, and did not answer.

“You and your deliberate suspense. You are truly a boring fellow,” The Monstrous Holy City’s City master rolled her eyes at the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master.

“Life is only delightful because it’s full of unknowns and indeterminate outcomes.”

“If one is to know everything beforehand, it would be truly too boring,” the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master said with a beaming smile.

............

Everything was as the Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s City Master had anticipated.

News of the Linghu Heavenly Clan waging war against the Starfield Master Realm soon spread, and created a ruckus throughout the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Soon, word of the death of Chu Xuanyuan also started spreading rapidly. Likewise, it created a ruckus throughout the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

The war between the Linghu Heavenly Clan and the Starfield Master Realm was not closely related to the Chu Heavenly Clan. At the very most, the Chu Heavenly Clan might be implicated by the spread of war.

However, Chu Xuanyuan’s death was inextricably linked to them.

The people that had been offended by Chu Xuanyuan in the past, and the people that had felt fear toward Chu Xuanyuan, and thus did not dare to retaliate against the Chu Heavenly Clan, were at that moment finally able to make good on their revenge. Furthermore, they aimed their spearhead fully at the Chu Heavenly Clan.

At that moment, experts from all over the starfield had gathered outside the Chu Heavenly Clan.

They were all from other Upper Realms. The majority of them were people that did not belong to any power.

Over ten thousand such individuals were gathered outside the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Practically none of those people were weak. The weakest amongst them were peak Martial Immortals. The great majority of them were Exalted-level experts.

In a place like the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm where Martial Immortals were peak experts, and Exalted experts were the strongest, the appearance of so many peak Martial Immortals and Exalted-level experts in a crusade against the Chu Heavenly Clan was simply akin to the arrival of a natural disaster.

Not only were the powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm all terrified, but a lot of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were terrified as well.

The protective spirit formation around the Chu Heavenly Clan had already been activated, sealing them off.

The experts of the Chu Heavenly Clan were all gathered inside the spirit formation. They were prepared to wage war against those outside at any time.
