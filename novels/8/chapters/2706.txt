Chapter 2706 - Chu Feng’s Appearance

The ten members of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation looked to one another with confused expressions.

They had clearly heard a furious shout sounding from that direction.

Yet, when they looked over, they could only see the border of the hunting ground, and not the person who shouted.

Could it be that it was a misperception?

But, that voice from earlier was so very loud and clear. It was obviously not a misperception.

“Are you all trying to find me?”

At the moment when the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were puzzled, Chu Feng emerged from the border and appeared before the crowd.

“It’s you?”

The ten Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were all startled upon seeing Chu Feng.

Evidently, none of them had anticipated that it would be Chu Feng.

At the same time, the people kneeling on the ground also revealed astonished expressions.

They were able to tell that the young man before them was also a member of the younger generation.

But, how could a member of the younger generation possibly dare to speak to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations in such a manner?

Subconsciously, they started to feel that the young man before than was not an ordinary person.

“This is truly what it means by searching far and wide only to have it appear before you.”

“We searched all around for you, and were unable to find you. Yet you actually decided to come to us.”

At that moment, those ten Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations revealed joyous expressions and malevolent smiles on their faces.

They were planning to attack Chu Feng.

Suddenly, the horse-faced man from the Chu Heavenly Clan asked, “Wait, how did you walk out from there?”

“It would appear that not all of you are fools. One among you actually noticed that,” Chu Feng mocked.

“Speak immediately! How could you enter from outside the hunting ground?!” That horse-faced man shouted.

To him, Chu Feng had walked inside the hunting grounds from outside its borders. Thus, he felt that Chu Feng had entered the hunting grounds from outside.

However, this was completely unreasonable. That was why he questioned Chu Feng like that.

“Outside the hunting grounds?”

“Haha. Watch carefully and see what this is.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve.

“Buzz~~~”

The next moment, the scenery behind Chu Feng started to twist and distort.

Soon, the scenery turned into rays of golden light and dissipated into thin air like a golden mist.

The next moment, the boundlessly vast region that was concealed by Chu Feng appeared before the crowd’s field of view.

“So that’s the case. That was actually a spirit formation. Damn it, we’ve been deceived!”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations realized what had happened. Upon realizing that they had been deceived, they grew extremely furious, and their expression changed enormously.

“No, something’s wrong. Even if someone had concealed this place, how did you know that border was formed by a spirit formation?”

Someone questioned Chu Feng again. Evidently, they did not realize that Chu Feng was the person who set up the concealment formation.

“That’s because I set it up,” Chu Feng said.

“Hahaha...”

Once Chu Feng declared that, the ten Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations actually burst into loud laughter.

Evidently, even though Chu Feng had personally declared it, they evidently did not believe that Chu Feng was the one to set up the concealment formation.

The reason for that was because they looked down on Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts. They all felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than trash.

“If you are able to set up such a concealment formation, then I would be able to create such a hunting grounds.”

“If he is able to set up such a formation, then I would be able to create a Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

“Hahaha!!!”

“Who doesn’t know how to boast? However, you should learn how to make your boasting more realistic first. Hahaha...”

......

The ten Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, regardless of their gender, were all ridiculing and laughing at Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng completely ignored their laughter and ridicule.

“It doesn’t matter whether or not you all believe me. You all merely need to know that it’s time for us to settle the debt from before,” Chu Feng said.

“Am I mishearing things? You actually want to settle your debt with us? Have you eaten a beast’s heart or a leopard’s gallbladder? You actually dare to talk to us in this sort of manner?”

“Have you forgotten the scene of you lying down before us like a dying dog?”

The Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations cast disdainful gazes toward Chu Feng.

However, Chu Feng merely smiled at them. He said, “I dare to guarantee that not only will you all be lying before me like a bunch of dogs, but you will also beg me for forgiveness.”

“Motherfucker! You dare to speak such conceited nonsense?! You’re trying to die, eh?!”

At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were furious. As they spoke, they all unleashed their attacks.

The ten of them began to set up spirit formations at practically the same time.

Golden light began to radiate all over, and killing intent was completely revealed.

It was a slaughtering formation. Although that slaughtering formation was not very powerful, they felt that it would be sufficient to seriously injure Chu Feng.

They actually did not wish to create too enormous of a disturbance either. That was why they deliberately held themselves back.

At the moment when they were setting up their spirit formations, Chu Feng managed to determine their strength.

All these people were Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, they were not even Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Before Chu Feng, they would simply be unable to withstand a single blow.

“Woosh~~~”

Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and the ten magnificent spirit formation attacks were all dispersed like mist.

“This...”

“How could this be?”

Those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were stunned. They had truly looked down on Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts. Thus, they had thought that they would be able to injure him easily.

However, what had just happened left them completely dumbstruck.

Chu Feng had clearly not even utilized his spirit power. How did he manage to disperse their attacks?

“Could it be that you’re still able to use your martial power?” The horse-faced man asked.

“To ask such a question, you are truly braindead,” Chu Feng shook his head mockingly.

“You dare insult me?! You’re simply courting death!” The horse-faced man let out a loud shout and unleashed another attack at Chu Feng.

The slaughtering formation he set up this time was capable of unleashing many different kinds of weapons. Although those weapons were not enormous, and they were only the size of ordinary weapons, they possessed extraordinary power.

Moreover, there were countless such weapons. Thus, as they rushed forth to attack Chu Feng, they had completely sealed off Chu Feng’s escape.

He was not merely planning to seriously injure Chu Feng this time around. Instead, he was planning on killing him.

Overwhelmed with anger, he was actually planning to kill Chu Feng.

“Woosh~~~”

However, Chu Feng merely waved his sleeve again. With that wave of his sleeve, not only did all of the weapons in the sky disappear, but even the horse-faced man’s slaughtering formation had dissipated.

Furthermore, an invisible violent wind blew that horse-faced man to the ground. When he fell, he began to vomit blood nonstop.

With a single attack, Chu Feng had seriously injured the horse-faced man.

Chu Feng had naturally used world spirit techniques. Merely... Chu Feng had concealed his world spirit techniques.

Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen felt that Chu Feng was simply not using world spirit techniques, but martial power.

Yet, it did not resemble martial power either. At least, they were unable to sense any martial power.

Thus, they did not even know exactly what sort of ability Chu Feng was using.

“Bastard, you dare cheat in this place?!” One of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations was furious.

“Cheat? I am truly concerned for your intelligence.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve again, and a burst of wind knocked the Chu Heavenly Clansman who had declared him to be cheating flying.

When that member of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation landed on the ground, he suffered the same sort of outcome as the horse-faced man. He was vomiting blood nonstop.

“You... you dare injure us? Have you grown tired of living?” A female from the Chu Heavenly Clan’s group of ten declared while pointing at Chu Feng.

She was actually saying those words with a threatening expression all over her face.

However, Chu Feng did not concern himself with her at all. He said, “It’s a fair competition. You all are able to injure others, so why am I not allowed to injure you?”

“Because we are people from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, you are not allowed to injure us,” the woman replied. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Hahaha...” Chu Feng burst into loud laughter upon hearing those words.

It was an extremely strange laugh. His laughter caused the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations to feel their hair stand on end.

Faintly, they noticed that the aura emitted by Chu Feng had changed.

They now managed to sense killing intent from Chu Feng.
