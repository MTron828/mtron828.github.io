Chapter 5929: Insist on Trying, Only to End in Failure

“What are you laughing at?” Long Mochuan asked.

“Nothing much.”

He wanted to say that he was really Qin Jiu’s successor, but he figured that Long Mochuan would follow up by asking him if he had evidence. It was not as if the latter would believe him anyway, so there was no point mentioning it.

“It’s just a hundred years anyway. We can further enhance the teleportation formation in the meantime, so that we’ll have a backup plan. It’s not too late to try the teleportation formation if we fail to repair this formation realm within a hundred years’ time,” Long Mucheng said.

“Mucheng, I know that there are risks, but I have conducted a thorough analysis, and the risks are not as huge as you think. We’re only in one of Qin Jiu’s many domains. He probably just created this place on a whim to rest. I am confident that this teleportation formation will bring us out of here.

“We were caught on a whim, so we didn’t bring much cultivation resources with us. We only have enough resources to channel the teleportation once. All preparations are in place now, so we shouldn’t miss this opportunity lest something happen. If things go wrong, we might end up getting trapped here for the next tens of thousands of years!” Long Mochuan insisted.

“Lord Mochuan, I trust your capability, but for our clansmen’s safety, I’d like to try Chu Feng’s method instead,” Long Mucheng said.

“Mucheng, you... Fine. Since it came down to this, let’s settle this by our clan’s rule. We shall hold a vote. Those who are willing to go with me, raise your hands.” Long Mochuan looked at his clansmen.

Out of the 30,000 clansmen present, only a few hundred people raised their hands, and these were people who were on closer terms with Long Mochuan. The others kept their silence.

This was not a situation Long Mochuan hoped to see.

“Fine. Very well! I never expected our united Dragon Breath Clan would be divided over an outsider’s words. So what if he possesses Heaven’s Eyes? Will his discernment be sharper than a True Dragon World Spiritist like me?” Long Muchuan was infuriated.

He felt humiliated by this outcome. At the same time, he was disappointed at having being betrayed by his clansmen.

“I shan’t waste my time idling here with you. Mucheng, you’re just holding our Dragon Breath Clan back by listening to that man’s words. A hundred years might not be a long time, but it isn’t short either. That’s an entire generation of juniors!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Mochuan waved his sleeves and marched toward the teleportation formation. The hundreds of people who raised their hands earlier moved together with him.

“Lord Moxiao.” Chu Feng turned to Long Moxiao and drew out a formation. “Please construct this formation and place it on them. It should help them if their attempt fails.”

“What a joke. Do you think I’d need a mere God-cloak World Spiritist’s protection?” Long Mochuan roared at Chu Feng.

He glared at Chu Feng with hateful eyes that looked as if he wanted to rip the latter into shreds. He thought that Chu Feng had not only foiled his plan but the Dragon Breath Clan’s future too.

“Hold it right there!” Long Moxiao suddenly roared. He released his spirit power to seal off the teleportation formation’s entrance. “Young friend Chu Feng’s formation might look simple, but it’s ingenious. It does resonate with the formation here. I believe it’ll be useful.”

Long Moxiao constructed hundreds of independent formations in the blink of an eye. This was the means of a rank eight True Dragon World Spiritist!

It was for that reason that Chu Feng told Long Moxiao to construct the formations on his behalf. It was not just out of deference for Long Moxiao’s identity but his capability too.

The gap in their spirit power couldn’t be easily bridged. A True Dragon World Spiritist’s formation was bound to be much more powerful than the ones constructed by him.

“Our clansmen have voted. You should have respected the outcome instead of leaving on your own whim. However, you did put a lot of effort into this teleportation formation, and I understand how you feel. Thus, I won’t stop you from trying out the teleportation formation. However, you have to carry this formation with you.

“All of us are world spiritists, so you should be able to tell that this formation will protect you, and it won’t hinder you from leaving this place either,” Long Moxiao said.

“Long Moxiao, do you intend to make an enemy out of me?” Long Mochuan roared.

“Long Mochuan, I am the Dragon Breath Clan’s chief world spiritist. I am the one who calls the shots in the field of formations, not you.”

Long Moxiao’s roar shook the world. His voice was even more intimidating than Long Mochuan’s.

This sudden roar shocked everyone, including Long Mochuan. His little brother rarely lashed out at him in such a manner.

“I won’t compromise any further than this. Try the teleportation formation if you wish, but you need to carry this formation with you. Feel free to decide among yourselves whether you wish to go through with it or not.”

Long Moxiao waved his hand, and the formations floated toward Long Mochuan’s group.

“Fine... Long Moxiao, I didn’t expect to see such a side to you. Fine, I’ll follow your order out of respect!” Long Mochuan reluctantly nodded.

He first placed the formation on himself before the others followed suit. Then, they entered the teleportation formation together.

A tremendous amount of spirit power flared from the teleportation formation, and it looked like everything was going well.

Many of the Dragon Breath Clansmen felt regret. Won’t we be missing this precious opportunity to escape from here if that teleportation formation works?

They didn’t bring much resources with them into this formation space, so they could only activate the teleportation formation once. Now that it had been activated, they wouldn’t get a second chance to use it.

However, Chu Feng quickly sensed that something was amiss. He turned to Long Moxiao and said, “Lord Moxiao, let’s take a closer look. We might need to take further precautions.”

“My thoughts exactly.” Long Moxiao lifted Chu Feng with his spirit power, and the two of them swiftly made their way toward the formation space.

This entire place was actually a protective formation; they were only able to get in here due to the crack in it.

Long Moxiao’s movements were hindered as soon as he stepped into the formation space due to the restriction formation placed on him. Thus, Chu Feng overtook him and rushed ahead.

Long Moxiao noticed a crack in the teleportation passageway he had constructed, and his face darkened. “This isn’t good.”

As a world spiritist, he could tell that this was the sign of a failed teleportation. It just so happened that the point of failure was the crossover point between the formation realm and the formation space, where the restriction formation started to take effect.

Should the teleportation fail, Long Mochuan and the others would be hurled out of the teleportation passageway. The chances were that all of them would die!
