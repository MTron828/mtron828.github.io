Chapter 4303 - Monster

“His bloodline going berserk?!” Xianhai Renhu’s expression became complicated after hearing those words.

Bloodline’s power was something that one inherited, something innate.

It was not something that only humans possessed. Monstrous beasts also possess them. As such, there were multiple different sorts of bloodlines.

Bloodlines possess a difference in power too. That was true even among people with the same bloodline.

The stronger one’s bloodline was, the further one would generally be able to reach in their path of martial cultivation.

Of course, that was not something absolute. While having a powerful bloodline was an innate advantage, the utilization of one’s bloodline would be dependent on the individual.

For example, if an individual possesses a very powerful bloodline but was unwilling to put in the effort of training, then that individual’s bloodline, no matter how strong, would be useless.

That being said, there also exist another sort of individual who possesses bloodlines so powerful that their bloodlines not only possess their own awareness, their bloodline would also, under special circumstances, seize their body to use as a media to release a portion of their power.

During those times, the master would lose consciousness and their bloodline would control everything.

As for that condition, it was known as one’s bloodline going berserk.

How rare was it to witness a bloodline going berserk?

After the time of the Ancient Era, there has only been three individuals who had shown sign of their bloodlines going berserk.

One among them was the Yuwen Heavenly Clan’s ancestor, the person deemed to be the strongest in the history of the Yuwen Heavenly Clan.

As for the other people, they were not people that possessed Heavenly Bloodline.

But, those two people also became renowned individuals in the martial cultivation world.

It was so much that those two individuals had both stood at the apex of the martial cultivation world.

Besides those three individuals, bloodline going berserk has never occurred again.

Because of that, bloodline going berserk has become a sort of legend.

According to the records... those with powerful bloodlines would not necessarily become powerful individuals.

But, those that had their bloodlines enter a berserk state will all ascend to the apex of the martial cultivation world.

That was the reason why even Xianhai Renhu was so shocked when he learned that Chu Feng’s bloodline was going berserk.

“Are you certain that this is the legendary ‘bloodline going berserk?’”

“Are you sure this is not caused by some sort of protective formation or treasure?” Xianhai Renhu asked the red-haired leader.

“Our clan’s ancestor, Lord Yuwen Chenkong, had experienced his bloodline going berserk.”

“Because of that, our clan had a detailed record of what the circumstances were like.”

“There’s no mistake. This scene is precisely one where one’s bloodline is going berserk.”

“Truly never would I imagine for there to have someone with such a powerful bloodline at a place like this.”

Shock filled the red-haired leader’s voice.

“Zzzz---”

Right at this moment, Chu Feng’s tightly closed eyes suddenly opened.

Seeing his opened eyes, everyone noticed that his eyes were filled with lightnings.

Furthermore, his gaze was completely devoid of emotions. It was so cold that one could tremble with fear just by looking at it.

“All of you... shall die!!!”

After saying those words, Chu Feng unleashed his attack.

He pointed his finger at the red-haired leader. Immediately, countless lightnings galloped toward that red-haired leader.

Seeing that, the red-haired leader immediately took out a sword.

The sword was silvery white in color. But, upon being unleashed, the sword surged with blue lightnings.

The appearance of the sword immediately increased the might of the red-haired leader.

“Woosh---”

He waved his arm and his sword’s aura surged forth. An enormous crescent sword ray filled with lightnings rushed to take on Chu Feng’s attack.

“Rumble---”

The lightning sword ray collided with Chu Feng’s lightnings and gave rise to terrifying energy ripples.

As the energy ripples devastated the surroundings, the red-haired leader shot back explosively.

Even Xianhai Renhu who was standing beside him was implicated by the collision.

Caught off guard, he too was sent flying by the energy ripples.

But, Chu Feng, on the other hand, stood there completely motionless.

“It’s this powerful?!”

Seeing this sight, the people from the Demon Morph Clan and even Xianhai Shaoyu who was being tormented were completely stunned.

Xianhai Shaoyu had taken note of Chu Feng’s transformation the moment he showed sign of his bloodline going berserk.

Being very knowledgeable, Xianhai Shaoyu had heard about the phenomenon known as one’s bloodline going berserk.

He knew that when one’s bloodline was in a berserk state, their strength will grow terrifyingly powerful.

But, he never anticipated for it to be this terrifying.

This was a power that far surpassed what Chu Feng possessed.

At this moment, the red-haired leader clenched his sword and rushed toward Chu Feng to confront him again.

This region instantly turned brightly lit.

But, those dazzling lights were all filled with fatal destructiveness. Those were terrifying powers caused by the assembly of enormous martial powers.

But, even though that red-haired leader was giving his all to frantically attack Chu Feng, he was unable to injure Chu Feng in the slightest.

All of his attacks were blocked by the lightnings surrounding Chu Feng.

Not only did he failed to injure Chu Feng, he was instead left in a sorry state by Chu Feng’s lightnings.

“Damn it!”

Seeing this, Xianhai Renhu who was trying to deprive the power of the black case from Xianhai Shaoyu’s body was forced to stop temporarily.

He confined Xianhai Shaoyu with his power and then tossed him to the other Demon Morph Clansmen.

Then, he flicked his wrist and took out an extraordinary weapon. With that, Xianhai Renhu flew toward Chu Feng.

Without Xianhai Renhu’s torture, Xianhai Shaoyu’s consciousness grew more and more clear.

Even though he was currently being restricted, the restriction allowed him to focus on observing the battle even more.

Both Xianhai Renhu and the red-haired leader possessed strength that far surpassed his own.

Yet, those two martial cultivation experts were unable to gain the slightest bit of advantage in a two versus one against Chu Feng.

Chu Feng looked completely relaxed. It was clear that he had yet to use his full strength.

It was as if Chu Feng could easily kill Xianhai Renhu and that red-haired leader should he willed it.

That was simply a peak martial cultivation expert who could show disdain toward the entire vast martial cultivation realm.

One could tell how terrifying Chu Feng was from the fear-filled gazes of the Demon Morph Clan’s experts.

Xianhai Shaoyu was originally very surprised to discover that Chu Feng’s talent surpassed his own.

But now, Xianhai Shaoyu once again gained a completely new understanding toward Chu Feng.

He had suddenly discovered that he, although renowned throughout the vast martial cultivation world and deemed as one of the strongest geniuses in the martial cultivation world, was far from being able to compare to the current Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, could it be that you’re... a monster?”

Fear also appeared in Xianhai Shaoyu’s eyes as he watched Chu Feng.
