Chapter 2259 - Dead On Refusal To Admit Fault

Afterward, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master brought Chu Feng, Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang to the entrance of the palace where Li Rui’s master and the other Law Enforcement Elders were kneeling.

Due to the fact that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master had left to find Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang through a side exit, Li Rui’s master and the others did not know about Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang being present beforehand.

As such, once they saw Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang, those Law Enforcement Elders immediately revealed dejected expressions. They felt as if they were about to face an imminent catastrophe.

However, Li Rui’s master was comparatively calm. At the very least, he did not reveal too much of a guilty conscience.

From this, it could be seen that he was truly an astute and circumspect individual.

“Head Elder Tuoba, I have revered you and respected you as the Head Law Enforcement Elder in vain.”

“I truly never expected that, for your own personal grudge, you would invert right and wrong, black and white, to plot Chu Feng’s death,” Xu Yiyi furiously denounced Li Rui’s master.

“Xu Yiyi, as a disciple, you actually dare to speak to the Head Law Enforcement Elder in such a manner?! Do you even have seniority in your eyes?!” Faced with Xu Yiyi’s criticism, Li Rui’s master actually became furious and started to criticize Xu Yiyi instead.

“Elder Tuoba, are you still going to pretend?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked coldly.

“Lord Valley Master, this subordinate is slow-witted, and does not understand what I have done wrong,” Li Rui’s master said with a puzzled expression.

“For now, I will not look into the fact that you have deliberately concealed the fact that little friend Chu Feng is an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

“I will also not yet look into the fact that you used a special method to seal little friend Chu Feng’s speech and spirit power.”

“However, you clearly knew that Chu Luyang had gone against the order from Elder Su Jingrui first, and received a well-deserved death as such.”

“Yet, you still brought little friend Chu Feng here, and asked me to order his execution. This is something that I absolutely cannot let you off for,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said in an extremely furious manner.

“What? Chu Luyang went against orders from Elder Su first?”

“What? Elder Su ordered Chu Luyang to do something?”

“Exactly what is going on here? Lord Valley Master, this subordinate doesn’t understand,” Li Rui’s master said with a puzzled expression.

“Don’t understand? How could you not understand? When my master warned Chu Luyang, your subordinates here were also present. Are you trying to say that they did not report this matter to you?” Xu Yiyi pointed at those Law Enforcement Elders.

“”What? There was actually such a thing? Why did you all not inform me of it?” Li Rui’s master had a furious expression as he turned to berate his subordinates angrily. He acted as if he truly did not know about those things.

“Lord Head Elder, we truly didn’t know about it,” However, those elders actually started to shake their heads repeatedly at the questioning from Li Rui’s master.

Furthermore, with confused expressions, they turned to Xu Yiyi and asked, “Yiyi, what did Elder Su say to Chu Luyang? Why do we not know about it? You have completely confused us here.”

“You all! You all are actually pretending to be confused?!” Seeing that they had refused to admit their faults, Xu Yiyi was so furious that her body started to tremble.

“No, we’re not pretending to be confused, we truly do not know what’s going on. Yiyi, for some things, you should not make irresponsible remarks,” Those Law Enforcement Elders said with innocent expressions on their faces.

“Good, very good. It would seem that you have already planned this in private, and have decided to dead on refuse to admit your faults,” Right at that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master laughed out loud. Merely, his laughter was very cold.

It was so cold that it caused the Law Enforcement Elders’ hearts to shiver and their expressions to change.

They started to panic, but even though their hearts were already panicking, they still did not modify their previous remarks. From this, it could be seen that they had already decided with Li Rui’s master to dead on refuse to admit their faults.

Although this method was very foolish, they felt that it was the only way to get out of this situation.

If they dead on refused to admit their faults, there would still be a chance to take a breath. However, if they were to admit to their faults now, they would likely receive very severe punishments.

While Li Rui’s master might not be killed, as he was highly important and indispensable in the Sunset Cloud Valley, the rest of the Law Enforcement Elders might not necessarily be able to escape death.

That was the reason why they dared to pretend as if they knew nothing before the very eyes of the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master. It was not because they were daring or bold. Rather, they were fighting for the opportunity to survive.

“Lord Valley Master, we would not dare to deceive you. We truly do not know what happened between Elder Su and Chu Luyang,” Those Law Enforcement Elders all kowtowed and spoke in unison.

“You all should know that deceiving me is a capital offense? However, I have decided to give you all an opportunity.”

“Thus, I’ll ask you all again. When Elder Su Jingrui told Chu Luyang that he was not allowed to attack the Red Butterfly Society again, that it would be a capital offense should he do so, did you all hear it or not?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked.

“Lord Valley Master, we truly did not hear it,” The Law Enforcement Elders said while shivering.

They were afraid, really afraid. However, even though they were feeling extremely afraid, they were determined to insist on not knowing about that matter. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The reason for that was because there was already no path of return for them now.

“Lord Valley Master, our Law Enforcement Department has always been loyal and devoted to the Sunset Cloud Valley. We have never once deceived you.”

“Yiyi, Ning Shaung, exactly what sort of benefit did the two of you receive from Chu Feng for you to wrongly accuse myself and my subordinates like this?” Right at that moment, Li Rui’s master spoke with a furious expression.

This old codger was not only quibbling, he even started to make false countercharges.

“You, you, you’re actually saying that we are wrongly accusing you?!” Hearing those words, Xu Yiyi became even more furious. Thus, she looked to the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master and said, “Lord Valley Master, please uphold justice.”

“Lord Valley Master, please uphold justice,” Li Rui’s master as well as the other Law Enforcement Elders actually also dared to request for the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master to uphold justice.

“Very well.”

“What exactly happened will all be known once Elder Su Jingrui comes out from his closed door training.”

“I will also know who exactly among you all have deceived me at that time. As for those who have deceived me, I will definitely not let them off easily!” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master shouted furiously.

“However, even if you all truly didn’t know that Elder Su Jingrui warned Chu Luyang that he was not allowed to attack the Red Butterfly Society, it remains the truth that you all have concealed the fact that little friend Chu Feng is an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”

“It is also true that you all used special methods to seal little friend Chu Feng’s speech, making him unable to speak. Thus, you have indirectly admitted to the false criminal charges you all have planted onto him,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.

“Lord Valley Master, you have wrongly accused us. I never knew that Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, nor did I use any special methods to make him unable to speak,” Li Rui’s master was still dead on refusing to admit his fault.

“You still dare to refuse to admit your wrongdoings?” Right at that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master waved his sleeve and directly knocked Li Rui’s master to the ground. He rolled on the ground for several loops before finally stopping.

At that moment, Li Rui’s master was bleeding from all seven apertures on his head. His complexion had turned pale, and his aura extremely weak. He had been severely injured.

Furious. The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master was truly furious. Else, he would not have injured Li Rui’s master so heavily.

Even though he had already seriously injured Li Rui’s master, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master was still furious. He pointed at Li Rui’s master and said, “The witness is present, and the evidence is definite. Yet, you dare to still refuse to admit your crimes? Tuoba Shangshui, did you really think that I would not dare to kill you?”

Even though Li Rui’s master was already seriously injured, he still hurriedly crawled back up and knelt before the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master again. He kowtowed, but did not dare to say another word.

Only his aged body was shivering in fear.
