MGA: Chapter 945 - Kill without Exception

When the Demon Sealing Sword arose, everything shook. Gales blew all about, and the entire palace was in chaos.

Only after a long while did it gradually calm down...

When the burst of might faded away, Chu Feng was still standing at the very same place; however, in his hand, there was an extra pitch-black sword—it was, of course, the Demon Sealing Sword.

“This... How is this possible? He truly pulled it out!”

Everyone was dumbfounded. They felt this was not reality, and some people were even trembling in fear. No matter what, they never expected this young man to truly pull out the Demon Sealing Sword.

It was the Demon Sealing Sword! A Royal Armament no one could pull out other than the former head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Even the Four Protectors had failed, yet this young man had succeeded! How could they remain collected?

“Bastard! Who do you think you are to hold the Demon Sealing Sword?”

You Mingdeng was enraged. He released his rank four Martial King aura, and with killing intent, he leapt towards Chu Feng. He was actually attacking Chu Feng.

*boom*

However, before he was even able to approach him, a thunderous explosion rang out. At the same time, the Demon Sealing Sword in Chu Feng’s hand shot up, bringing Chu Feng into the air. After breaking through the palace’s ceiling, he broke through the underground palace, into the surface, arriving in the sky.

“Heavens, what is that? What flew from beneath?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It’s a person, and it seems to be someone from the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Who is that? I don’t think I’ve seen him before?”

The people on the surface still didn’t know anything that occurred underground. When an object flew out from below and straight into the blue sky, it shocked the people above ground. All of them raised their head and curiously looked.

Simultaneously, the ones underground started flying out and arrived on the surface. What Chu Feng took away was the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s treasure, the Demon Sealing Sword!

However, only after arriving on the surface did they discover Chu Feng hadn’t left. At that moment, he stood unmoving in the air. The sky itself started changing due to Chu Feng’s emergence.

*boom rumble rumble rumble*

Rolling black clouds surface into the peaceful atmosphere, and thick strings of lightning were akin to enormous sinister dragons as they circled around Chu Feng’s body, protecting him.

The Demon Sealing Sword released endless black mist which lingered endlessly in the air. A horrifying ear-piercing howl, akin to the cry of a demon, reverberated through the mist and out into the surrounding area.

Moreover, the black mist progressively increased in size. By the time it stopped expanding, it had already enveloped the entire sky. Despite the terrifying howls and cries that rang out from the black mass, none of it harmed Chu Feng. Rather, it appeared that it was guarding him instead.

“What is happening? The Demon Sealing Sword is protecting him!” Not to mention others, even You Mingdeng and the other Protectors were completely baffled.

“You Mingdeng, I pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword! Therefore, I am now the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect! You don’t kneel and kowtow, and even dare to attack me! This is truly dishonourable, and this offense warrants execution!” Chu Feng shouted as he held the Demon Sealing Sword and pointed at You Mingdeng below.

“What? That’s the Demon Sealing Sword? The Crippling Night Demon Sect’s most valuable treasure, the Demon Sealing Sword?”

Chu Feng’s words undoubtedly told everyone he had successfully pulled it out, and became qualified to lead them.

“What should we do? When the sect head was alive, he had indeed said the one who pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword could become sect head, and we had to unconditionally serve that person!”

Many people panicked. Although Chu Feng had been successful, they were naturally unwilling to have a person they knew nothing of to lead them.

“Who are you?!” You Mingdeng asked. His words lacked the slightest bit of respect, and instead were filled with fury and resentment.

“You really want to know who I am? No problem, I’ll show you who I am!” Chu Feng laughed, then waved his big sleeve. When the sleeve slid past his face, Chu Feng’s complexion had changed, returning to its initial form.

“Chu Feng? He’s Chu Feng?!”

The observers couldn’t help but deeply gasp. Some were incomparably excited, and some felt disbelief.

Even though for many of them it was their first time seeing Chu Feng, they still recognized him. After all, Chu Feng was famous in the Eastern Sea Region. His wanted posters were pasted in every street in the Eastern Sea Region. Not to mention the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, even many ordinary citizens knew of Chu Feng’s appearance.

“Brother Chu Feng, is it you? Is it truly you? You haven’t died?”

Xuan Xiaochao and Fu Fengming were elated as they shouted loudly. If it weren’t for their masters stopping them, they would have already risen into the air and passionately embraced him.

Their relationship with Chu Feng had always been quite good. When they first heard that Chu Feng had possibly died, they had even felt sorrowful for quite a while. Right now, knowing that Chu Feng hadn’t died yet, they were naturally surprised and excited.

“Big Brother Xuan Xiaochao, it is indeed me. I haven’t died. I escaped from the Misty Peak.” Chu Feng nodded. He too had quite good feelings towards Xuan Xiaochao and the others.

“Haha, it truly is Chu Feng! This is great! I was wondering why this person was so monstrous... So he was Chu Feng! He’s an unprecedented genius in the Eastern Sea Region, and now, he has pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword! He should indeed become sect head.”

There were cheers that rang out within the sea of people after confirmation of Chu Feng’s identity. From that, one could see a large portion of the Crippling Night Demon Sect felt it was acceptable for Chu Feng to become sect head. Some even wanted him to.

Although Chu Feng had only been in the Crippling Night Demon Sect for a very short time, his achievements completely convinced them all. They felt only a genius like him could bring the Crippling Night Demon Sect back to its glory. He was the most suitable nominee for sect head.

Before, due to the existence of the Four Protectors, they didn’t dare to say those words. However, Chu Feng had now pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword. He became the successor the former sect head decided on. They could finally speak the thoughts in their hearts.

“Chu Feng, I knew you had ulterior motives by joining the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Indeed, you came here for the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s invaluable treasure, the Demon Sealing Sword! Today, don’t even think of leaving!

“Members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, attention! This child is not a member of our sect, and he even dares to rob our treasure! He must be killed without exception.

“No matter who it is, if you’re a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, you will have accomplished a great deed if you kill Chu Feng, and you will be greatly rewarded!” But just at that moment, You Mingdeng pointed towards Chu Feng and shouted. He had actually ordered Chu Feng’s death.
