Chapter 5335: The Ancestor Appears

“You have a sharp tongue, but let’s see how long you can last!” Yuan Jiang sneered.

With a wave of his sleeves, he manifested countless sharp blades in the sky with his martial power before dropping them like a rain of swords. 

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

The swords plunged into the bodies of those from the Ancient Realm and Bai Yunqing. 

These weren’t ordinary swords. They were imbued with black flames that seared whatever they came into contact with, bringing about unimaginable pain to their victims. 

Gah!

The elders of the Ancient Realm cried out loud.

Bai Yunqing tried to withstand the pain with gritted teeth, but his cultivation was simply too weak. He soon spurted a mouthful of blood and passed out. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The only one who managed to stay conscious and not cry out was the Ancient Realm’s chief. 

“Yuan Jiang, I’ll be waiting for you down below. I’ll see how you can face our ancestors after betraying the Ancient Realm!” the Ancient Realm’s chief howled.

“You’re still running your mouth?” 

Yuan Jiang’s face warped in anger as he prepared to make his next move, but his body suddenly stiffened up. He subconsciously turned his gaze toward Eggy. 

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master and the others also did the same too. Smiles were forming on their faces.

It turned out that Eggy’s body had started to become translucent. The black gaseous flames raging inside her devoured her body whole before they began to disperse into the surroundings. Her life force swiftly dwindled along with their dispersion. 

Eggy was dying.

Yuan Jiang and the others knew that, and they were excited to witness the death of a being who could have become one of the strongest powerhouses in the world of cultivation. 

Right before Eggy’s black gaseous flames faded into the distance, they suddenly froze in place. A second later, the black gaseous flames converged at where Eggy was lying earlier, forming a huge bundle of flames.

This allowed Eggy’s dissipating life force to stabilize.

The bundle of black gaseous flames descended from the sky, falling into a pair of small hands. 

“That is…?”

The crowd was stunned. 

Perplexed looks could be seen on their faces, especially those from the Ancient Realm, though the one who was the most shocked of all was none other than Yuan Jiang. The owner of that pair of hands was none other than Little Crescent.

Yuan Jiang had killed Little Crescent’s parents so that he could take her in and groom her as his successor. He had been taking care of Little Crescent from a young age, but for some reason, he felt that the little girl currently standing before him felt a little foreign.

Boom!

The grayish-black aura suddenly gushed at Little Crescent like a ferocious beast. The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master had made his move.

He didn’t recognize Little Crescent, but he could tell that she was planning to save that terrifying Asura World Spirit. That was not something he could permit, thus he decided to kill her.

Boom!

Yet, the deluge of grayish-black aura scattered before it could strike Little Crescent.

“How could this be…”

The crowd was shocked by what they had seen, especially Yuan Jiang and those from the Ancient Realm. 

All along, they had thought of Little Crescent as a powerless little child, but this powerless little child was somehow withstanding the attack of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master!

While they were still struggling to come to terms with the situation, Little Crescent raised her head to look at the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master, saying, “You don’t have manners. I’ll teach you some.”

Her expression had the innocence of a child when she said those words, but then her lips curled into a chilling, malevolent smile. Her eyes and the imprint on her forehead began glowing. 

Gah!

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master cried in agony.

The crowd initially couldn’t understand why the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master was crying when Little Crescent hadn’t made her move yet. However, upon closer inspection, they saw wisps of smoke seeping out of his body. The smoke was devouring him from within! 

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master struggled with all his might, but he couldn’t get rid of the smoke within him.

“This is!”

When Yuan Jiang and the others saw the smoke and the words ‘Ancient Realm’ glowing on Little Crescent’s forehead, they suddenly came to a realization.

“Kill her!”

The experts of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace simultaneously unleashed their martial power on Little Crescent, hoping to suppress her, but their martial power dissipated helplessly before their attacks could land. No matter what they tried, they weren’t able to get to her, let alone injure her.

Moments later, everyone from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace suddenly cried in agony. 

Without any warning, the same smoke that had appeared inside the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master had started seeping out of their bodies, devouring their bones, blood, and even their origin energies.

“Why is there such a monster in your Ancient Realm?!” the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master roared at Yuan Jiang.

But Yuan Jiang wasn’t in a state to respond at all. He trembled uncontrollably on his feet, his unfocused eyes reflecting the sheer shock he was being put through. 

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master understood that Yuan Jiang wasn’t of any help to him anymore… and the Bluemoon Sacred Palace was going to meet its end in the hands of this little demoness. 

Thus, he turned to Zhou Dong and said, “Dong’er, you must live on!”

The Bluemoon Sacred Palace formed some hand seals, and teleportation energy began to envelop Zhou Dong.

“Protecting your descendant?”

Little Crescent noticed what the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master was trying to do, but she didn’t stop him. Instead, she quietly looked upon the situation with a smile. It was only until Zhou Dong was sent off by the teleportation energy that her eyes finally turned wintry.

Despite Little Crescent’s young appearance, her gaze, her demeanor, and her tone showed that she was someone who had lived through the ages. 

“A bunch of incompetent fools dares to attack our Ancient Realm?” Little Crescent sneered.

With a snap of her fingers, the members of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace exploded. Not even the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s Palace Master was able to survive the attack. 

Bloodstained armor, clothes, and weapons fell from the sky. She raised her right hand and sucked those items into her right palm before clamping her hand shut.

Following that, she turned her attention toward the black gaseous flames that Eggy had morphed into. While maneuvering the black gaseous flames with her left hand, she opened up her clamped right hand once more. A black orb floated up from her right palm.

The world quaked ever so slightly to the presence of the black orb. It was a treasure containing Asura Power. Even with a glance, those from the Ancient Realm could tell that the black orb was a priceless treasure. 

“Lass, you mustn’t die, at least not yet. I’m counting on your man to take me out of here,” Little Crescent said with a smile.

She clenched her fist around the black orb, crushing it into bits. With a wave of her hand, she fused the crushed bits of the black orb together with Eggy’s black gaseous flames. As if having received nourishment, the flickering black gaseous flames immediately stabilized.

“Paying respects to Lord Ancestor!”

The Ancient Realm’s chief and their elders kneeled down before Little Crescent. 

With all of the clues in place, be it the overwhelming strength Little Crescent had displayed when massacring the Bluemoon Sacred Palace’s army, the words ‘Ancient Realm’ that had appeared on her forehead earlier, or her age, it was apparent what her true identity was.

Little Crescent was the prophesied reincarnation of their ancestor!

“Get up. You people might be lacking, but at least you’re loyal to the Ancient Realm,” Little Crescent said.

She then turned her gaze upon Yuan Jiang, the man who had raised her for five years. Her eyes were freezing cold. 

“You were the one who gave me the tip?” Yuan Jiang asked.

“That’s right,” Little Crescent replied.

“Why did you induce me to betray the Ancient Realm?”

“I was planning to make you my aide, but I sensed your wild ambitions. I had a feeling that you wouldn’t hesitate to betray the Ancient Realm should an opportunity present itself…” Little Crescent snorted in disdain. “… and I was right.”  

“I did this for the Ancient Realm!” Yuan Jiang argued.

“You must really think of me as a five-year-old child.” 

Little Crescent looked at Yuan Jiang with her innocent eyes, but there was no way the latter would dare to think of her as a naive child anymore. 

She was one of the ancestors of the Ancient Realm. Her wisdom and experience far surpassed his wildest imagination!
