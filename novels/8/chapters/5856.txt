Chapter 5857: Battle of the Heavenly Gods

“Half-God level?”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders were taken aback. They thought that the person standing before them was related to the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect.

“She’s the Hidden Dragon martial Sect’s sectmaster,” Puppeteer Exalted reminded.

“Oh.”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders revealed smiles upon realizing that the other party had nothing to do with the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. They thought nothing about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect at all; even its sectmaster was nothing more than an ant to them.

“So your goal was the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect all along. Attacking our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was just a cover; you simply wanted to use our protective formation. However, I won’t let you get your way. The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect doesn’t belong to our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but it’s still a property of our Ancestral Martial Galaxy. I can’t let you take it away,” the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster said.

Overwhelming spirit power gushed forth from her, and it quickly expanded till it spanned the size of a realm. The spirit power spiraled around the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, and a peculiar noise reminiscent of chants echoed from the spiral.

“A mere act.”

The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief smashed its hammer toward the spiral.

Gah!

Shockingly, the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was the one to cry in alarm. Not only did his attack fail to breach the spiraling spirit power, but he was even left twirling across space.

The other five Ancient Era’s clan leaders were dumbfounded too. The eyes of the spectating crowd nearly bulged out.

“How could a Half-God level cultivator be this powerful?”

Before everyone’s confused gaze, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster changed her hand seal and said, “Dugu Yuexia, the incumbent Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, humbly beseech our first sect leader to bestow the power you have left behind to me.”

The world shook. Even the spectators who had retreated far away could feel the tremors.

A gigantic figure emerged from the spiraling spirit power. A white, translucent head first appeared, followed by its upper body. Just by what had appeared thus far, this being had to be at least the size of a realm when standing.

It emanated a terrifying aura that intimidated even the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders.

“This isn’t good. Retreat!”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders immediately retreated. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Uwa!

All of a sudden, blood spurted from the mouth, eyes, ears, and nose of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, and she lost her balance and fell. At the same time, the terrifying spirit power dissipated.

“She can’t withstand the power,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master said.

“It doesn’t matter. Kill her!”

The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief thrust its palm forward, unleashing a martial power palm that flew across space to strike the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster.

At this critical moment, a person appeared in front of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. She had her back facing the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders as she supported the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster to her feet.

A mere flick of her slim hands raised a furious storm that dissipated the martial power palm.

“Who is it this time?”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders and the distant spectators intently stared at the person.

It was a woman dressed in a pristine but simple white dress that made her look holy, but something felt off about her. She was young, and her appearance looked ordinary. No one present recognized her.

“Elder, you’re back...” The weakened Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster looked at the woman in a white dress.

“You should have just protected the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Why did you get yourself involved in this? You could have lost your life for invoking the sectmaster’s power,” the woman in white dress said.

“I...” The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster wanted to explain herself.

“Stop talking and recuperate. I’ll deal with the rest.”

The woman in a white dress popped a pill into the mouth of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, and the latter fell unconscious shortly after. However, this appeared to be helpful to her recuperation.

Only then did the woman in a white dress stand up and look at the six Ancient Era’s clan leaders.

“Are you from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect too?” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master asked.

He could deduce as much from the conversation between them.

“Why bother asking?” the woman in white dress replied.

“We’re after the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s treasures; it has nothing to do with your Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Don’t put your head where it doesn’t belong,” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master said.

“That’s true, but you used our protective formation to invoke the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect. How should we settle that?” the woman in white dress asked.

However, the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master was not looking at her but the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s main city. It had become even more faded.

“She’s stalling time. Don’t waste time and kill her!” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master roared as he constructed a slaughter formation.

The other five Ancient Era’s clan leaders made their moves too.

Despite being faced with five Heavenly God level cultivators and one Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist, the woman in a white dress did not attempt to flee. Instead, she confronted them with a powerful burst of martial power.

“She’s strong! Who could have thought that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect has a Heavenly Dragon level cultivator? No wonder none of the powerhouses dare to invade the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. I’ve heard rumors that hidden experts are protecting the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but to think those are true!”

“As long as there’s a Heavenly God level cultivator guarding the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, we can’t say that it has truly fallen into decline.”

The crowd exclaimed.

A man with a large head even smacked his hands on his thighs and exclaimed, “Amazing! This is truly exciting! It was worth abandoning my wife and child to watch this drama! This is far more exciting than I have imagined!”

He had come with the intent to watch the commotion, and if possible, get his hand on the treasure too. The latter was likely impossible here, given that Heavenly God level cultivators had gotten involved, but just what he had witnessed today made him think that this trip was worth it.

“You should quickly retreat. You’ll be in danger if you continue lingering here,” an old voice suddenly echoed in the ears of the spectators.

“Who’s the one talking?”

The crowd looked around, but there was no one to be seen.

“Let’s go. There must be another powerhouse here. We should scatter.” Some of the more cowardly ones turned around and left.

“How timid! We’re just watching the show; what could happen to us?” Many chose to stay behind and watch the show. They didn’t think that they would be killed for watching the scene.

“Incredible! She’s standing her ground despite being outnumbered. Isn’t that woman in a white dress amazing?”

The crowd was getting more immersed in the fight. It was a fight involving Heavenly Dragon level cultivators, after all. They couldn’t see the details, but they could sense the tremendous force rippling into the surroundings.

Had this fight happened in a realm, the realm would have long shattered into bits under the devastating shockwaves.
