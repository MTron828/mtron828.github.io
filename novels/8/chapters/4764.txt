Chapter 4764: Xia Yan is Xia Yan

Chu Feng wouldn’t have dared to believe it if he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, but the backing which Xia Ran had been relying on all this while was actually an acquaintance of his!

In truth, Xia Yan was the same Xia Yan as he met back at the Asura Graveyard.

Back then, Chu Feng had visited the Graveyard Realm under Song Yun’s request in order to obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. However, when he learned that the Asura Graveyard contained a lot of Asura Evil Spirits, his interest in the Asura Graveyard was piqued.

So that he could enter the Asura Graveyard, he participated in the marriage selection held by the leader of the Graveyard Realm, the Wretched Black Demon, for his own granddaughter. There, he met two allies, namely Xia Yan and Xiao Yu.

These two people were incredibly powerful and had a mysterious background. What was worthy of mention was that the two of them were women disguised as men.

The reason why Chu Feng knew that was because he had seen their real bodies by a stroke of coincidence, but fortunately, neither of them blamed him for that.

As Chu Feng had helped them quite a bit along the way, they managed to forge a bond of friendship despite having only known one another for a short while. This was especially so for Xia Yan.

However, he had never thought that the Xia Yan from the Graveyard Realm would actually be the same renowned Xia Yan in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.

So, he was quite surprised and overjoyed when he first saw Xia Yan.

With his relationship with Xia Yan, he knew that the latter wouldn’t just blindly believe Xia Ran’s lies. As expected, Xia Yan was also incredibly moved when she recognized Chu Feng.

In fact, she even began questioning her beloved younger brother for his sake.

“A misunderstanding? In other words, the Chu Feng whom you said oppressed you is no other than him?” Xia Yan asked.

Everyone could sense the rage seething in her voice.

“It’s a misunderstanding, big sis!” Xia Ran cried out miserably.

It was one thing for Chu Feng to know Li Muzhi, but he never thought that the other party would know his big sister, Xia Yan, too!

He felt incredibly panicked at the moment. He realized that there was nothing he could say that could save him from the quandary he was in at the moment.

“Misunderstanding? Is this the misunderstanding you’re talking about?”

Chu Feng opened his palm, and a ball of light darted out from his hand. The ball of light was initially just the size of a little pearl, and as it flew into the sky, it grew larger and larger.

Weng!

Soon, the ball of light expanded to the size of a mini-moon in the sky. It was so large that all of the cultivators looked no more than ants in its presence.

Figures began appearing inside the ball. There was Chu Feng, Xia Ran, and the other disciples from the South Vermilion Hall.

Everyone belatedly realized that this was a formation that recorded everything that had happened after Xia Ran entered Chu Feng’s residence. Through this formation, they saw that Xia Ran had intentionally hurt himself. Afterward, the subordinates suddenly barged out of the door and started screaming for help.

Everything else was as they saw afterward.

It turned out that Chu Feng knew that Xia Ran was up to no good right from the start, so he chose to enter his residence first so as to set up a recording formation in advance so as to leave some evidence behind should Xia Ran try to pull anything.

“Xia Ran, is this the misunderstanding you’re talking about?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.

However, Xia Ran ignored Chu Feng and pleaded with Xia Yan instead, “Big sis, things aren’t like that. You mustn’t trust him. It’s merely an illusion he forged through the formation!”

Then, he turned to Chu Feng and bellowed, “Chu Feng, you sure are despicable! It’s only on the account that you’re acquainted with my big sis that I said that it’s a misunderstanding so as to not put her in a spot. I swallowed my grievances and chose not to settle the score out of respect for my older sister, but you shamelessly tried to bite back and frame me of slandering you!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He was eager to dump it all on Chu Feng upon realizing that his ploy was going to be exposed here.

However, Xia Ran’s actions only made Xia Yan more and more infuriated.

“Xia Ran, do you really take me for a fool? Others might try to slander you, but definitely not Chu Feng!”

Xia Yan turned her eyes toward Xia Ran’s subordinates and said, “The lot of you, tell me the truth. Otherwise, I’ll take your lives!”

Xia Ran’s subordinates had already turned pale in fright. Xia Yan’s threat made their legs wobbly as they kneeled down onto the floor. Upon seeing this, Xia Ran quickly shot a vicious glance in their direction while threatening them through his voice transmission.

There was no way he could allow his subordinates to reveal the truth to Xia Yan.

And between Xia Ran and Xia Yan’s threats, it was actually quite easy for the subordinates to come to a decision. So, all of them ended up confessing the truth.

They revealed that it was Xia Ran who told them to frame Chu Feng.

To make things worse, Xia Ran feared that things would look too suspicious if he only roped his aides in this, so he intentionally found two of the more righteous disciples from the South Vermilion Hall to help him on this. Naturally, those two disciples were unwilling to do Xia Ran’s bidding, but Xia Ran coerced them with threats, leaving them with no choice but to follow his instructions for their own survival.

With the plan falling apart now, they made full use of this opportunity to tell Xia Yan how Xia Ran had coerced them into doing his bidding.

“You bastards! I treated all of you so well, but how dare you turn around and frame me? Tell me! Just what did Chu Feng give you?”

Xia Ran couldn’t tolerate being betrayed by his own people. Despite being in public, he released his killing intent, displaying his intent to teach his subordinates a lesson.

Pu!

However, a dull thump suddenly sounded, and Xia Ran ended up freezing in place.

The crowd also stiffened up as well, not daring to believe what they were seeing.

Xia Ran’s dantian had been pierced through, causing his blood to flow out profusely. At the same time, the cultivation he had built up with great difficulty also started flowing away from him swiftly too.

“Big sis, you...”

Xia Ran stared at Xia Yan in disbelief.

Yes, it was indeed Xia Yan who had personally crippled Xia Ran’s cultivation.

“Xia Ran, my very mistake is to condone you to this day, but it all comes to an end now. You aren’t worthy of anything you have at the moment. Return to the mortal that you used to be!”

Xia Yan clenched her fist tightly, and a mini-explosion sounded. Blood gushed out as the small hole in Xia Ran’s abdomen immediately enlarged. His body immediately fell to the ground, having lost its ability of flight.

If his cultivation was still flowing away from him earlier, it had disappeared all at once this time around.

Xia Yan wasn’t leaving any chances at all.

The crowd was all flabbergasted to see Xia Yan crippling Xia Ran’s cultivation. Before they could snap out of their daze, Xia Yan had begun speaking once more.

“Xia Ran, you are convicted of using despicable means to coerce and harm your fellow sect members. As a Hidden Dragon Disciple, I sentence you to the crippling of your cultivation. However, in view that you have made past contributions to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, I’ll spare your life. From this day onward, you’ll be evicted to the outer hall, never to enter the four halls ever again! If an elder harbors some doubts toward my judgment, you’re free to report it to the sectmaster or the Hidden Dragon Elders!” Xia Yan declared loudly.

That was a clear sign that Xia Ran was a goner. He had only risen to his current position due to Xia Yan’s backing, so how could anyone possibly pose any doubts when Xia Yan was the one personally convicting him now?

In fact, most people were more than glad to see this turn of events.
