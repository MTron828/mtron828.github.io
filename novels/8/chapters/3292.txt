Chapter 3292 - Above Exalted

“If our clan does not protect you, who should we protect?”

“As such, that is not a reward. Instead, it is merely something that our clan should do for you,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt a great amount of warmth. The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was truly treating him like a close relative. He was not pretending to do so, but was instead being good to Chu Feng out of genuine sincerity.

“Senior, the Bloodline Cultivation Formations are ineffective for the current me. However, I have managed to gain some comprehension as to how to use my bloodline’s power in the Bloodline Altar.”

“Merely, my bloodline power is very difficult to control, and I have never attempted to control it in the past. If I am to suffer a backlash upon attempting to control my bloodline’s power, I’m afraid that it will produce unthinkable consequences. As such, I wish to request a proper cultivation ground from senior,” Chu Feng said.

“Very well, follow me,” As the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he soared into the sky and began to fly toward the depths of the forbidden area.

Seeing this, Chu Feng immediately soared into the sky to follow him.

On the way there, Chu Feng said, “Senior, there is one thing that this junior wishes to mention to you.”

“Chu Feng, you do not have to stand on ceremony when we’re alone. Go ahead and say what you want,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said, His attitude was very easy-going, and did not resemble the behavior of a clan chief. Instead, he was more like a senior who adored Chu Feng deeply.

“Right now, the Bloodline Cultivation Formations have miraculous effects for Exalted-level experts. However, they have very little effect for those below the Exalted level. I think... there is no need to open the Bloodline Cultivation Formations to those below the Exalted level, or things will become chaotic with the increase of people. If word of this matter is to spread, it will likely intice calamity upon us,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, you are truly considerate. That said, you should be able to guess what I was discussing with Chu Xuanzhengfa and elder Hanpeng earlier,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked with a smile. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“So senior has already anticipated this. This junior has spoken out of turn,” Chu Feng smiled. He understood what the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief discussed with Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others.

Likely, they were discussing keeping the matter regarding the Bloodline Cultivation Formations confidential. Actually, that was normal too. After all, this matter was something that must be kept confidential, for it would definitely bring forth an unexpected calamity should it be revealed.

Not to mention the Li Heavenly Clan, all of the other powers would also attempt to capture that place. In fact, even the Starfall Master Realm might directly involve themselves in the matter.

After all, a cultivation ground capable of increasing the cultivation of Exalted-level experts was truly rare to come by.

“No, you were not speaking out of turn. Instead, you were being considerate. Look, the ones that have entered the Bloodline Cultivation Formations today are all the pillars of our clan. However, only a few among them immediately came out to seek me in discussion about maintaining secrecy upon discovering the extraordinary power of the Bloodline Cultivation Formations.”

“The great majority of them chose to immerse themselves in training so as to quickly make breakthroughs in their cultivations. As for our clan’s safety, they have decided to cast that to the back of their minds.”

“You, who are still only a member of the younger generation, are countless times stronger than them,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, this Chu Feng is truly ashamed should you say it like that. The reason why I came out was actually because the Bloodline Cultivation Formations truly provided me with too little benefits,” Chu Feng smiled embarrassedly.

“I know your personality very well. Even if the Bloodline Cultivation Formations had provided you with enormous benefits, you would likely still have come out to mention this matter,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Chu Feng didn’t know how to respond, and merely smiled again.

The reason for that was because he didn’t know if he would immediately come out should he be able to gain great benefits from training inside the Bloodline Cultivation Formations.

Perhaps he would, and perhaps he wouldn’t.

As that was a scenario that had never happened, he couldn’t possibly know what he would do.

Although the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief seemed to be talking a stroll in the sky, his speed was extremely fast. As he was being led by his power, Chu Feng’s speed was also very fast.

As the two chatted away, they arrived at a mountain peak.

The mountain peak rose from the ground like a sword piercing the clouds. The summit of the mountain peak was not vast, yet there was a palace located there.

Above the palace entrance was a signboard. Written on the signboard was ‘Utmost Exalted Skill Refinement Hall.’

Pushing the gates open suddenly opened up a wide panorama.

There was a completely different world within the palace entrance. The surface was completely covered with white stones. Although the stones appeared to be very fickle, the tens of thousands of miles contained inside the palace hall, that seemingly boundless earth, was covered completely with white stones.

With the earth covered in stones and a blue sky above one’s head, being there would lift one’s spirit, bringing about a sense of relaxation. Indeed, this was a rare place to enter closed-door training.

“This is the place where I go for my closed-door training. Apart from me, no one else in the clan is allowed to use this place. However, from today onward, you will be an exception to that rule,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Senior, I don’t think you should do that,” Chu Feng said humbly; he was overwhelmed by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s affection.

“Don’t bother. It’s merely a cultivation ground. If this place is truly capable of allowing our clansmen to advance by leaps and bounds, I would be willing to allow anyone to come in here to train. Unfortunately... there is no such individual within our clan. Of course... that’s excluding you,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled. His eyes were filled with the desire to pamper Chu Feng and expectations toward him.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng wanted to reply with some modest remarks.

However, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief began to urge him to stop.

Chu Feng was not someone who was incapable of recognizing another’s good intentions. Since the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was determined, he no longer attempted to refuse. Instead, he sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes.

What Chu Feng planned to do was something extremely remarkable. He planned to connect with the nine enormous lightning beasts within his body and utilize their power.

Once Chu Feng began his attempt, he continued sitting there with his eyes closed for two entire hours.

After two hours passed, Chu Feng finally opened his eyes again.

The current Chu Feng had a very pale complexion, and was sweating profusely. Even though he had only sat down cross-legged with his eyes closed for two hours and didn’t do anything else, he resembled someone who had undergone a fierce battle. His health was extremely weak.

Most importantly, there was an expression of disappointment in Chu Feng’s eyes. It was disappointment toward himself.

The reason for that was because the outcome of his training was not optimistic at all.

Even though he had clearly gained some enlightenment of the preliminary method to utilize the power of his bloodline from the Bloodline Altar, and also that the enlightenment he gained was quite significant too, which could be seen by how the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations ended up being forever open, he was still unable to control his bloodline’s power.

Although controlling his bloodline’s power was more difficult than he had imagined it to be, Chu Feng was not discouraged. After a short rest, he immediately closed his eyes again. He planned to try again.

“Chu Feng,” However, right at that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s voice was suddenly heard.

Chu Feng opened his eyes and looked toward the direction of the voice. Upon doing so, he discovered that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was actually standing in the sky ten thousand meters away from him. Furthermore, he had a very serious expression on his face.

Chu Feng sensed that something was amiss. Immediately, he stood up and asked, “Senior, what’s wrong?”

“Chu Feng, what did you do earlier?” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“I... was merely attempting to connect with my bloodline’s power according to what I’d comprehended in the Bloodline Altar. Unfortunately... I failed,” Chu Feng shook his head and replied with a embarrassed smile.

“Failed?” Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s expression changed. Disbelief appeared in his eyes. Shortly afterward, he said, “What happened earlier doesn’t seem like a failure.”

“What happened earlier?” Chu Feng was able to tell that there was some sort of deeper meaning to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s words. Immediately, he asked, “Senior, could it be that something happened earlier?”

“Roughly an incense stick’s worth of time ago, nine-colored lightning emerged from your body. The lightning was surging and snarling violently. With you at the center, they covered an era of ten thousand meters. That lightning was so imposingly powerful that even I was astonished by it.”

“Not only did that lightning possess heaven-defying might, but they themselves also possessed frightening power,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Frightening power?” Chu Feng was surprised. He realized that this matter was very extraordinary.

He had clearly failed in gaining control over his bloodline’s power, thus how could his bloodline’s power be overflowing from his body and wreak destruction on his surroundings?

Exactly what was happening?

“Chu Feng, you must know that this place was constructed by that mysterious excellency. Not only are the stones that cover the ground extremely firm, but they are also embedded with spirit formations. That mysterious excellency once said that unless one has a cultivation above the Exalted realm, one will not be able to cause any damage to the stones here. However you... Look at your surroundings,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng immediately looked down and around him. Upon doing so, he discovered that all the stones in a radius of ten thousand meters around him were covered in cracks.

Although the cracks were not very deep, it remained that those stones were damaged. Furthermore, Chu Feng did not notice it before, as he was concentrated on his training, but now, he noticed that there was a hint of a burning smell from the stones.

That was the aftermath of being struck by lightning.

Furthermore, with how thick the cracks were, those stones were most definitely not struck by a single bolt of lightning. Instead, there was likely a myriad of lightning that continued to strike them repeatedly.

“Senior, this was caused by me?” Chu Feng asked.

“This old man witnessed it with his very own eyes, it was indeed caused by you,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke with certainty.

“Senior, these stones, are they really stones that can only be destroyed by experts above the Exalted realm?” Chu Feng asked once more.

“Absolutely,” The Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Sssss~~~”

Hearing those words, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from suching in a mouthful of cold air. Shock and terror filled his eyes.

Only those above the Exalted realm would be able to destroy the stones.

That would mean... the Utmost Exalted Realm!!!
