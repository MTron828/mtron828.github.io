Chapter 2438 - Method To Undo Seal

“Say, big brother, why must you do this and make yourself suffer? Quickly, take the medicinal pellet. Being able to recover a bit is better than nothing. Else, if you are unable to properly mine tomorrow, you will likely end up receiving a beating again.”

As the youth spoke, he moved the medicinal pellet to Chu Feng’s mouth.

However, right at that moment, a voice transmission entered the youth’s ear.

“Little brother, are you really the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s young master?”

Naturally, the voice transmission came from Chu Feng.

The rooms here did not even have doors, much less spirit formations to isolate sound. Thus, everything was within the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s surveillance.

As Chu Feng wanted to discuss some secret matters with the youth, he could only do so through voice transmission.

“You... you’re fine?” The youth was shocked.

Although Chu Feng appeared to be very seriously injured, his voice was very resounding and vigorous. It simply did not resemble the voice of someone who was injured. This completely dumbfounded the youth. He felt this to be very miraculous.

“Rest assured, I am fine. Answer my question first,” Chu Feng continued to ask.

“Big brother, I, Zhan Lingtong, am never one to lie. I am indeed the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Young Master. My father is the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief,” This Zhan Lingtong was very smart. While pretending to be attending to Chu Feng’s injuries, he started to converse with Chu Feng through voice transmission.

“In that case, answer three of my questions.”

“First, what is the relation between the Ancient Era’s War Clan and the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan?”

“Second, what is the cultivation of the strongest fellow in the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan?”

“Last, why did you come to the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s territory?”

Chu Feng asked three questions in succession.

Zhan Lingtong began to answer Chu Feng’s questions through voice transmission.

With this, Chu Feng came to know about the situation at hand.

Firstly, the Ancient Era’s War Clan and the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan had been hostile powers for many generations.

The two of them were equally strong in this day and age. It was only during the time when Zhan Haichuan appeared that the Ancient Era’s War Clan was able to suppress the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan. However, Zhan Haichuan did not eliminate the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan.

Zhan Haichuan did not provide an explanation as to why he decided not to do so. Thus, not to mention the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan, even the people from the Ancient Era’s War Clan were puzzled.

And now, the strongest individual in the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan was a rank five Martial Ancestor. Furthermore, that individual possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.

Chu Feng was actually quite disappointed upon finding this out. Although a rank five Martial Ancestor with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation was very powerful, so strong that Chu Feng would not be a match even if he was to regain his cultivation, it was simply too ordinary of a cultivation when placed in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Not to mention the people from tier one powers, even some of the experts from tier two powers would be able to contend against someone of that cultivation and battle power, and even defeat them.

The reason why Chu Feng was so disappointed was because this was, after all, the War Clan’s Ancient Domain, the birthplace of Zhan Haichuan. For the strongest fellow here to only possess that sort of cultivation and strength was simply too weak.

To Chu Feng’s greater disappointment, although the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was weak enough, the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief, Zhan Lingtong’s father, was even weaker.

Although Zhan Lingtong’s father, the current Clan Chief of the Ancient Era’s War Clan, also possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, he was only a rank four Martial Ancestor, an entire level of cultivation weaker than the Clan Chief of the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Beasts were afraid of Zhan Lingtong’s grandfather, an existence who had been in closed-door training for a long time, and the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s grand defensive formation, they would most likely have already led their army to exterminate the Ancient Era’s War Clan.

“Then why did you come here?” Chu Feng asked again after hearing about the situation. That was something that he was curious about himself.

“I like a girl. Although she is a human, she is not a part of our Ancient Era’s War Clan. My clan has refused to permit me to be with her the entire time.”

“During this period of time, our Ancient Era’s War Clan and the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan have been fighting nonstop. In recent years, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan has grown more and more powerful, and they have forcibly taken many of our clan’s territories. It just so happened that the place where that girl lives in is now a territory occupied by the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan.”

“If I want to find her, I need to infiltrate into the territory of the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan. Actually, this mine and the forest that we were in before were both our Ancient Era’s War Clan’s territory in the past. Merely, they are now...” When mentioning that matter, Zhan Lingtong had a helpless and unreconciled expression.

Chu Feng understood his feelings very well. After all, Zhang Lingtong was someone from the Ancient Era’s War Clan. As such, the sensation of one’s clan’s territory being seized by another would most definitely be unpleasant.

Zhan Lingtong sighed. “And now, I’ve been captured by the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan and reduced to their slave. I am truly too useless.”

“Fortunately, they do not know who I am. Else, if they were to use me as a hostage, I fear...” Zhan Lingtong had an expression of self-blame.

“Don’t think that way. I actually feel that you’re very brave,” Chu Feng said.

“I’m brave?” Zhan Lingtong asked.

“At the very least, I feel that the fact you are willing to bear this risk for someone you love is something that ordinary people cannot accomplish. I believe that you will definitely attain great accomplishments in the future,” Chu Feng said.

“You are truly good at comforting others. Merely... I don’t understand. Do you really not know about the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan? Why did you do that?” Zhan Lingtong asked Chu Feng.

Zhan Lingtong was actually indirectly implying something with his questions. He wanted to ask Chu Feng why he had confronted the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan only to suffer in the end.

“If I were to tell you that I’m from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, would you believe me?” Chu Feng asked.

“Don’t joke around. With your cultivation, how could you possibly enter this place?” Zhan Lingtong said.

“In that case, if I am to tell you that I didn’t lie to you, and that I would have been able to take care of those fellows, you would definitely not believe me too, no?” Chu Feng asked again.

“Your injuries are very serious. It is best that you take this medicinal pellet and rest yourself. We will have to work laboriously tomorrow.”

“The mountain mine is called the Martial Essence Stone Mine. The ores in this mine possess Natural Energies. However, they are extremely labor intensive to mine. One must use special tools to mine them. Furthermore, if one does not possess the cultivation of a Martial Emperor, one will simply not be able to mine the ores.”

“Comparatively, when Half Martial Ancestors try to mine the ores, it will be easier. As both you and I are Martial Emperors, we will likely end up suffering hardships from tomorrow onward,” Zhan Lingtong evidently did not want to continue on this topic. Thus, he started to earnestly urge Chu Feng to rest.

“Very well. In that case, you should properly rest yourself tonight,” Chu Feng didn’t try to continue the previous conversation. He swallowed the medicinal pellet and closed his eyes to rest.

“Oh, that’s right, here’s your weapon,” Suddenly, Zhan Lingtong tossed the Evil God Sword to Chu Feng.

The Evil God Sword appeared very ordinary right now. In fact, it appeared inferior to even ordinary Incomplete Imperial Armaments. It no longer possessed its overwhelming killing intent and destructive power.

Seeing this Evil God Sword, Chu Feng felt very complicated.

He had experienced the might of the Evil God Sword. That sword was even more frightening than he had anticipated it to be.

He... nearly became a cold-blooded murderous demon because of the sword.

However, if it wasn’t for the Evil God Sword, how could he possibly have been able to escape from the Kong Heavenly Clan? Likely, he would’ve been killed by those Utmost Exalted Elders.

Thus, no matter what, regardless of whether it might be the fact that his cultivation and world spirit space were sealed or the fact that he had nearly had his body seized by the Evil God Sword, it remained that... Chu Feng was only able to survive thanks to the Evil God Sword.

With those thoughts in mind, Chu Feng received the Evil God Sword and placed it into his Cosmos Sack. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He would be very cautious when using the Evil God Sword again in the future. However, when absolutely necessary, the Evil God Sword might save his life again.

“Chu Feng, I thought of a way that might be able to undo the seal around your world spirit space and your cultivation,” Right at that moment, Her Lady Queen’s voice suddenly sounded.

“What is it?” Chu Feng hurriedly asked.

This was what Chu Feng wanted to know the most right now.
