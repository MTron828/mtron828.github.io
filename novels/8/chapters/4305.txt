Chapter 4305 - Scared Breathless

Suddenly, the space around Chu Feng began to tremble.

Then, two figures appeared.

One left and one right, they stood on either side of Chu Feng.

They were a middle-aged man and an aged old ape.

While that ape looked very old, his gaze was so very fierce.

That gaze of his does not resemble a gaze that an ordinary monstrous beast could possess.

Anyone with experience could tell from that old ape’s gaze that he was a monstrous king level existence.

As for the man, unlike the fierce looking old ape, he had a gentle gaze.

From a glance, he looked very mediocre. But, should one pay close attention, one would feel him to be unfathomable.

As for this man, he was none other than Chu Feng’s father Chu Xuanyuan.

As for that aged old ape, he was Chu Xuanyuan’s partner of many years, Old Ape.

Compared to when they were imprisoned in the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area, the sensation Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape gave off had changed enormously.

Although the two of them have yet to unleash their oppressive might, one could tell merely by looking at them that they were people not to be trifled with.

But, Xianhai Renhu and the red-haired leader were not afraid.

After all, the two of them were also people with extraordinary origins themselves. Furthermore, behind them was the powerful Demon Morph Clan.

What was the Demon Morph Clan? It was a wicked power capable of bringing terror to the various major powers of the martial cultivation world.

“If I am correct, you must be this youngster’s father?” Xianhai Renhu spoke with a stern voice.

While Chu Xuanyuan did not introduce himself, Xianhai Renhu was able to tell from their physical resemblance that they were father and son.

Chu Xuanyuan did not answer Xianhai Renhu’s question.

He was acting as if he did not hear anything.

Seeing that, Xianhai Renhu frowned. A look of displeasure appeared on his face.

But, he didn’t say anything.

The reason for that was because he had a faint feeling that his opponent’s strength might not be weaker than his own. In fact, it was very possible that his opponent was stronger than him.

If that wasn’t the case, he couldn’t possibly fail to detect them.

To attack recklessly against an opponent like that was not a sensible act.

But, while Xianhai Renhu had determined Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape to not be people that should be trifled with, the others of the Demon Morph Clan clearly did not.

As Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape had not unleashed their oppressive mights, the others from the Demon Morph Clan had no idea how strong they were.

On top of that, Xianhai Renhu mentioned that Chu Xuanyuan and Chu Feng were father and son.

Because of that, the others from the Demon Morph Clan determined Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape to be from the Holy Light Galaxy.

What sort of place was the Holy Light Galaxy? In their eyes, it was nothing more than a desolate galaxy.

The martial cultivators of this place were all low level creatures to them.

How could such low tier individuals dare to ignore their Lord Xianhai Renhu? In their eyes, that was simply something that cannot be forgiven.

“Insolent bastard! Are you deaf or what?!”

“Our Lord is asking you a question! Why are you not answering at once?!”

Because of that, a member of the Demon Morph Clan pointed at Chu Xuanyuan and lashed out angrily.

The tone of his voice was not only extremely arrogant, it was also filled with contempt toward Chu Xuanyuan.

“Woosh---”

But, right after that person said those words, the Old Ape disappeared.

When Old Ape reappeared, he had arrived within the Demon Morph Clansmen and was standing before the person that lashed out at Chu Xuanyuan.

“Pow!---”

Before the Demon Morph Clansmen could react to what was going on, Old Ape grabbed that Demon Morph Clansman’s head and raised him up.

“Wuuu---”

At this moment, that Demon Morph Clansman began to howl in pain while struggling violently.

But, no matter how he struggled, it was all useless. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Before the Old Ape, he was akin to a chick that was powerless to break free.

“Courting death!!!”

Seeing that, the other Demon Morph Clansmen all revealed their weapons and oppressive mights. They were planning to attack the Old Ape.

Suddenly, Old Ape clenched his grasp.

“Puchi,” blood splattered everywhere.

He had crushed apart the head of that Demon Morph Clansman.

Then, the headless corpse of that Demon Morph Clansman fell into the boundless starry sky below.

Seeing that scene, the Demon Morph Clansmen that had unleashed their weapons all stood stunned with their weapons in hand. None of them dared to rashly attack the Old Ape.

Merely that Old Ape’s simple action had made them realize that seemingly very aged old ape was an extremely terrifying homicidal fiend.

Even if they all attacked him together, they will not be able to last many bouts against that homicidal fiend.

“Two sirs, is it possible to let us live?” Xianhai Renhu spoke again.

As matters stood, he was practically certain that Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape were extremely difficult opponents.

He doesn’t wish to have a complete fall out against Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape at a time like this.

Even though one of their Demon Morph Clansman has been killed, he still wanted to reconcile.

“You dared to touch our young master, yet you still wanted to leave here alive?” Old Ape sneered.

“Are you planning to refuse the face that we’re giving you?”

“Do you know who we are?!” shouted the red-haired leader.

“Boom---”

Right after his words left his mouth, Chu Xuanyuan’s clothes fluttered in the wind. Then, boundless oppressive might swept forth from his body. Like an invisible tornado, it instantly engulfed this region.

The moment that oppressive might arrived, the people from the Demon Morph Clan, including even Xianhai Renhu and that red-haired leader, all had an enormous change in their expression.

Shock and fright filled their eyes.

The reason for that was because they felt themselves to be nearly suffocating under Chu Xuanyuan’s oppressive might.

No matter what, when they were against Chu Feng who had his bloodline in a berserk state, they were able to fight against him.

But, facing Chu Feng’s father, they simply do not even possess the qualification to stand off against him!!!

Although Xianhai Renhu was utterly terrified by Chu Xuanyuan, he still tried his hardest to contain his emotions and put up a calm front.

“You two should know who we are.”

“Our Demon Morph Clan can be considered to be quite reputed in the martial cultivation world.”

“Even without me mentioning it, you should know of the way our Demon Morph Clan does things.”

“Right now, our Demon Morph Clan’s main army is already here.”

“Even our Lord Clan Chief is in this galaxy.”

“If you are willing to drop this matter at this, we will not look further into what happened here today.”

“But, if you insist on taking things to the extreme...”

“At that time, it will not only be you all that will die, all the people in the entire Holy Light Galaxy will be buried with you,” Xianhai Renhu threatened Chu Xuanyuan.

Realizing that he would not be able to defeat Chu Xuanyuan, he was forced with no other choice but to bring up his backing.

Of course, what he said was also the truth. The Demon Morph Clan’s main army were indeed already in the Holy Light Galaxy.

Furthermore, if they were to die, the people from the Holy LIght Galaxy will most definitely suffer a calamity at the hands of the Demon Morph Clan.

“Heh...”

Hearing those threatening words, Chu Xuanyuan chuckled.

That laughter of his was so very mocking, so filled with contempt.

Seeing and hearing that laughter, Xianhai Renhu realized that the man before him seemed... to not place their Demon Morph Clan in his eyes at all.

“What are you laughing at?!” asked the red-haired leader furiously. He even unleashed his oppressive might as he spoke.

He was infuriated by Chu Xuanyuan’s ridiculing attitude and was planning to attack him.

As for Chu Xuanyuan, he did not even bother to look at that furious red-haired leader. Instead, he looked to Xianhai Renhu.

“Are you talking about them?” asked Chu Xuanyuan.

“Them? What do you mean by that?” Xianhai Renhu was confused.

Right after he asked that question, Chu Xuanyuan raised his arm and a dark-black colored spheroid was tossed into the air behind him.

“Buzz---”

Suddenly, the sphere rapidly expanded in size. It expanded to the size of an entire world and covered this region of the starry sky.

That was a world filled with lightnings. Once that world was expanded to its full size, countless screams could be heard from within it.

That world simply resembled hell itself. It was terrifying to witness.

And, upon closer inspection, Xianhai Renhu, the red-haired leader and the others of the Demon Morph Clan all felt their scalps go numb with fear. They’ve been scared breathless.

Some of the more cowardly individuals began to shiver in fear.

There were even several that fell unconscious from witnessing the sight.

Turned out, there were hundreds of millions of people inside that world.

All those people were being cruelly tortured.

They were all tied up and being struck by the terrifying lightnings inside that world in an orderly succession.

Those terrifying lightnings were breaking down their bodies and forcibly stripping them of their bloodline’s powers.

What was deemed as the most cruel thing to do in this martial cultivation world was happening right before their eyes.

Furthermore, it was happening to hundreds of millions of people simultaneously.

But, if that was all, the vicious and ruthless Demon Morph Clansmen would not become this terrified.

The reason for their utter terror was because those hundreds of millions of people were all their Demon Morph Clansmen.

All of their Demon Morph Clan’s top experts were in there.

Even their Lord Clan Chief was in there...
