MGA: Chapter 1104 - Excessively Powerful

“Woosh, woosh, woosh.”

After he finished saying those words, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster began to move his hands and create all sorts of special hand seals.

At the same time, numerous streams of golden spirit energy spilled out from within his body like little serpents. They swam around in the air, and finally assimilated into the sculpture of the Ascension Sect’s ancestor.

“Buzz.” As the golden spirit energy assimilated with the sculpture, the sculpture began to emit a faint flicker of light. After that, it actually started to slowly move. Moreover, its speed began to grow faster and faster. When the sculpture completely moved to the side, a spirit formation gate actually appeared at the location where the sculpture was previously.

This spirit formation gate was square-shaped. However, it was no ordinary spirit formation gate. It was clear that the spirit formation gate had been created through spirit formation techniques. However, it appeared like an ‘actual’ gate. Most importantly, this spirit formation gate was impregnable. If one must find a weakness in this spirit formation gate, then there would only be one place -- the two key holes. As long as one possessed the keys to those holes, one would be able to open the spirit formation gate.

“Swoosh.”

“Swoosh.”

Right at this moment, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster inserted the two spirit formation keys into the holes on the spirit formation gate. However, even though the keys had been inserted, there was still no change to the spirit formation gate.

“Ruochen, Chu Feng, it’s up to you two now.” The Ascension Sect’s sectmaster appeared to have anticipated this. He cast his gaze toward Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.

Seeing this, Bai Ruochen directly walked toward the spirit formation gate. Using her lily-white hands, she grasped the first spirit formation key, causing it to immediately radiate with light.

As the spirit formation key radiated with light, the spirit formation gate also began to dazzle with light. Furthermore, the runes and symbols on any portion of the spirit formation gate that the light touched would begin to move about, left and right, as if they were alive.

However, the light only covered half of the spirit formation gate. As for the other half, it remained the same as before, without any change.

At this moment, Chu Feng finally understood what was going on. After the spirit formation keys recognized their masters, only the masters of their respective keys would be able to activate the keys. He was recognized as the master of one spirit formation key on top of the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda. As for the other key, it was obvious that it recognized Bai Ruochen as its master.

Thus, Chu Feng did not hesitate anymore and directly walked forward. Using his hand, he grabbed the key that had recognized him as its master. After grabbing it, the key in his hand began to emit light much like Bai Ruochen’s spirit formation key.

The light assimilated into the spirit formation gate, illuminating its other half. At this moment, the runes and symbols on top of the spirit formation gate began to circulate through it. At the same time, rumbling also sounded out from within the spirit formation gate.

“Chu Feng, Ruochen, fall back.” Seeing this, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster shouted loudly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As for Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen, they both leapt backward and away from the spirit formation gate.

“Buzz.” After the two of them jumped back, the spirit formation gate actually began to disperse within the strong light. At this moment, a deep and bottomless tunnel, that no one knew where it led, appeared at the location where the spirit formation gate previously stood.

“This place is the location where my ancestor left the Dragon and Phoenix Dancing in the Skies behind.” At this moment, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster was overjoyed. With a wave of his gown, he suddenly jumped. Bringing with him a powerful might, he was trying to enter into the tunnel.

“Boom.”

However, right when his legs entered the tunnel, he was bounced back by a powerful force. The force of the rebound was so strong that it nearly caused him to crash into the wall.

“There’s actually a protective screen?” At this moment, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster was standing in the airspace above the palace hall after having been rebounded. He was frowning deeply; the joy on his face was completely gone, and replaced with shock.

“Allow me to try.” Seeing this, Bai Ruochen’s mother decided to give it a try. With a movement of her body and a sway of her long skirt, she arrived before the tunnel’s entrance.

“Boom.” However, like the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster, Bai Ruochen’s mother was also launched backward by the force of the tunnel the moment she entered it.

“Woosh, woosh.” However, she did not give up so easily. At the moment when she was ejected, she waved her hand and two flying needles, formed by martial energy and spirit power, were shot out by her toward the tunnel.

“Bang!” However, who would’ve thought, that the moment when the two needles entered the tunnel, they were not bounced back. Instead, they were detonated by a formless power. The might of the power causing the explosion was so strong that it even brought an overwhelming shock to the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster and Bai Ruochen’s mother.

“This is not good, there is indeed a protective screen. If we try to force our way in, I fear that it might cost us our lives, for that protective screen is truly too powerful.” Bai Ruochen’s mother shook her head and came up with a conclusion of being unable to proceed.

“Why would it be like this? We have clearly already opened the spirit formation gate. Why is it that we cannot enter? Lord ancestor, why must you make things so difficult for us?...” The Acension Sect’s sectmaster’s face was filled with confusion and an expression which was hard to describe with words.

It was a kind of worried appearance. An extremely desolated worry. He had hoped for this day to come for a very long time. And now, the spirit formation gate was finally open. Yet, he was unable to enter it. This gave him the sensation of having all of his hopes being crushed in an instant; it was an extremely painful feeling.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing? Don’t go over there.” Right at this moment, Sikong Zhaixing suddenly shouted.

Upon hearing that shout, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster and Bai Ruochen’s mother noticed that Chu Feng had actually already arrived in front of the tunnel. Moreover, he was currently placing his foot into the tunnel.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing? There’s an extremely powerful protective screen around that tunnel. Your cultivation is insufficient, do not try anything reckless.” At this moment, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster also spoke.

However, who would’ve thought that Chu Feng would actually ignore their warnings and directly enter the tunnel. But, to their enormous surprise, Chu Feng entered the tunnel safe and sound; there was no rejection from the protective screen.

“This... what is going on?” At this moment, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster was completely stunned.

Soon, Chu Feng flew back out from the tunnel and landed before them.

“I understand now. It is not that the protective screen is not there; instead, it only prevents us from entering. As for Chu Feng and Ruochen, they have opened this place. Thus, the two of them are not obstructed by the protective screen. Chu Feng, you are truly too smart.” Bai Ruochen’s mother suddenly came to a realization and began to praise Chu Feng repeatedly.

At this moment, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster and Sikong Zhaixing also understood why Chu Feng did not heed their warnings earlier. It turned out that he had already guessed that this would be the case. Yet they, leaders of powers who have lived for numerous years, were unable to anticipate that.

This caused them to have a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng. At the same time, they began to look at Chu Feng with a new light, they also felt ashamed of themselves.

“Senior Sectmaster, I suspect that only Miss Bai and I are able to enter this tunnel. Why don’t you allow Miss Bai and I to enter in your place and obtain your ancestor’s remnants for you?” Chu Feng suggested.

“Sigh. As the matter stands, there is no other alternative. Merely, Chu Feng, Ruochen, I believe that there would be a deep intention in the Lord Ancestor’s placing of such a restriction. I fear that there will be great difficulties and dangers within this tunnel. You two, you must be careful. If you are to encounter a hurdle that you cannot pass, you must not try to force your way through,” advised the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster.

“Senior, please rest assured.” Chu Feng cupped his fist respectfully. Then, he looked to Bai Ruochen and said with a smile, “Miss Bai, let’s go.” After he finished those words, with a movement of his body, Chu Feng entered the tunnel.

“......”

Seeing this, Bai Ruochen curled her lips. She muttered something that no one else could hear, then moved her frail body and also entered into tunnel. Sure enough, there was no obstruction for her either.

As he saw the two of them disappearing into the tunnel, the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster displayed a complicated expression. Shortly after, he turned to Sikong Zhaixing and said, “Headmaster Sikong, this disciple of yours is a bit excessively powerful.”
