Chapter 2898 - Enjoying The Inheritance Alone

“Chu Feng, did you manage to obtain the inheritance?”

The Starfall Holy Land’s two male disciples asked excitedly.

The reason why they asked Chu Feng this, and did not enter the gate to check things out for themselves, was because ever since Chu Feng exited the gate, the ninth Inheritance Site had disappeared.

Thus, even if they wanted to go in, they wouldn’t be able to. The only thing they could do was ask Chu Feng about it.

“Inheritance? I have indeed obtained it,” Chu Feng did not try to conceal anything, and spoke truthfully.

“You’ve obtained the inheritance? You’ve obtained all of the inheritance?” Those two Starfall Holy Land’s male disciples asked.

“That’s right, all of the inheritance is with me,” Chu Feng did not deny it.

“Insolent!” Hearing those words, those two Starfall Holy Land’s male disciples were immediately enraged.

“Why didn’t you call us in?! Didn’t you say that as long as it was the Life Gate, you would inform us about it?!”

“Chu Feng, you unfaithful vile character! We have trusted you in vain! You actually deceived us and hogged all of the inheritance for yourself!”

At that moment, not only did the two male disciples from the Starfall Holy Land immediately turn hostile toward Chu Feng, but they even began to speak ill of Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng frowned. In an extremely displeased manner, he said, “Firstly, after I entered it, the gate closed off by itself. Even if I wanted to come out and inform you all, I was unable to do so.”

“Next, I needed to receive all of the inheritance in order to open the gate again. That is also the reason why the gate even reappeared. You all have been here the entire time. Thus, you should’ve seen it, no?”

“Most importantly, after the gate reappeared, I only saw Milady Queen enter it to look for me, and not you all. What’s the meaning of that?”

“You all only cared about your own lives, and simply did not care about mine. Yet now, you’re actually lashing out at me and declaring that I’m hogging everything for myself?”

“Let me tell you all this. I, Chu Feng, did not plan to hog everything for myself. However, even if I do now, you all deserve it.”

“The reason for that is because you all didn’t dare to enter the gate to receive the inheritance. As such, you are unqualified to receive the inheritance,” Chu Feng declared.

“You!!!”

The two Starfall Holy Land’s male disciples were left speechless by Chu Feng.

Indeed, what Chu Feng said did not sound like a lie. It was true that after Chu Feng entered the gate, the gate had disappeared. Thus, even if he wanted to come out and inform them, he would not have been able to.

Furthermore, when the gate reappeared again, it was true that they did not possess the courage to enter it.

Helpless, the two of them looked to Xia Yun’er. They seemed to want Xia Yun’er to say something.

However, Xia Yun’er had no intention of speaking for them. Instead, she was looking at Chu Feng with a smile on her face. There was not only no blame in her eyes, but they were instead filled with deep concern.

Seeing this, Chu Feng walked over to Xia Yun’er and streaked his palm across his Cosmos Sack. The next moment, a total of twenty Immortal Armaments appeared before her.

“Those are?”

Upon seeing those Immortal Armaments, not to mention the Starfall Holy Land’s disciples, even the eyes of the Nine Profound Sect’s disciples started to shine.

The reason for that was because those twenty Immortal Armaments were all top quality Immortal Armaments. They were definitely not something that ordinary Immortal Armaments could compare to. They could even be considered actual treasures.

Moreover, there were also cultivation materials and treasures that possessed special effects in addition to those twenty Immortal Armaments.

Although they were not as eye-catching as the Immortal Armaments, they were all valuable treasures. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Young master Chu Feng, what are you...?” Xia Yun’er’s beautiful eyes started to spin as she asked Chu Feng in a somewhat puzzled manner.

“Although you didn’t enter, I feel that you deserve this.”

“This is a portion of the inheritance, accept it,” Chu Feng said.

“This...”

“Thank you, young master Chu Feng.”

Xia Yun’er was slightly hesitant. However, in the end, she still accepted it.

If those were ordinary Immortal Armaments and treasures, she might end up refusing them. However, faced with the twenty Immortal Armaments that Chu Feng presented to her, there was no reason for her to refuse him.

Not to mention her accepting them for herself, even if they were placed in their Starfall Holy Land, they would be rare treasures.

“Brother Chu Feng, we were wrong earlier. We have wrongly accused you.”

Right at that moment, those two Starfall Holy Land’s male disciples walked over to Chu Feng with longing expressions on their faces.

Seeing the two of them like this, Chu Feng smiled lightly, “What’s this? You want to receive treasures too?”

“My apologies, the two of you are not qualified to receive any treasures.”

“You! Chu Feng, you are truly despicable! You should know that what you’ve obtained is our Starfall Holy Land’s treasures!”

“We are already extremely benevolent to be willing to share them with you! Yet, you actually want to hog everything for yourself?! How shameless can you be?!”

Seeing that Chu Feng not only refused to share the inheritance with them, but even insulted them on top of that, those two male disciples turned hostile once again.

Chu Feng completely disapproved of their claims. With a faint smile, he said, “Your Starfall Holy Land’s treasures? If they were your Starfall Holy Land’s treasures, then why is it that you all were unable to acquire them? Why did they end up in my hands instead?”

“Your Starfall Holy Land’s treasures? Why don’t you say those words to the Chu Heavenly Clan? Go and ask them, see if they would recognize that the treasures here belong to the Starfall Holy Land.”

“You!!!”

The Starfall Holy Land’s two male disciples were so furious that their complexions turned green. However, they did not know how to refute Chu Feng.

It was not only them. After Chu Feng said those words, the expressions of the Nine Profound Sect’s crowd also changed.

Indeed, this location did not belong to the Starfall Holy Land. Thus, there was no such thing as first come first served.

The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was the territory of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, if one must insist on determining ownership, the Chu Heavenly Clan should be the owner. It was absolutely not the Starfall Holy Land or the Nine Profound Sect.

“Furthermore, I must remind you all of this. Before I entered the gate, you all firmly believed that the gate I’d entered was the Death Gate.”

“If it wasn’t for me, Chu Feng, you all might’ve already listened to Senior Zhao and decided to enter the gate on the left.”

“If it wasn’t for me, Chu Feng, you all might already be dead by now.”

“And here you are wanting to demand the inheritance from me?”

“Humph, humph. The way I see it, the shameless one isn’t me. Rather, it’s the two of you.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he suddenly looked to the southeast. There was no one there. However, Chu Feng knew that the direction he was looking toward was linked to the outside of the Inheritance Cave, the place where all the elders were gathered.

Looking to that direction, Chu Feng just so happened to look at those elders face to face.

“I might as well tell you the truth. This place is Exalted Archer’s remnants. The inheritance that I, Chu Feng, have obtained is Exalted Archer’s inheritance.”

“However, I, Chu Feng, relied on my own ability to obtain the inheritance. Thus, not to mention these two shameless fools, even if the Starfall Holy Land wants to demand the inheritance from me, I will only say...”

“... don’t think about it.”

Chu Feng had made a firm resolution that he would definitely not share what he had obtained with anyone else.
