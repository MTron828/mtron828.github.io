Chapter 4964: The True Demon

“Gah!”

Shengguang Baimei let out a cry of agony.

Master Yin Ren had manifested ten sharp swords using his spirit power and pierced them into Shengguang Baimei’s flesh.

One must know that even though Shengguang Baimei was being suppressed at the moment, his cultivation had reached rank nine Martial Exalted level. A rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist couldn’t hope to harm him at all.&nbsp;

The only reason why Master Yin Ren’s spirit power was able to injure Shengguang Baimei was due to him having reached rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation!

“This fellow…”

Fear could be seen reflected in the eyes of Shengguang Buyu and Daoist Niantian.

They had known all along that Master Yin Ren wasn’t one to be underestimated, but they didn’t expect him to have reached this level.&nbsp; ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Not only was he a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator with the power to further raise his cultivation by a rank, but he was also a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist on top of that.&nbsp;

With his strength, even those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan wouldn’t have been a match for him.&nbsp;

It was fortunate that Master Yin Ren didn’t take Shengguang Baimei’s life right away after curbing him. Instead, he turned his gaze toward Chu Feng.

“Young friend Chu Feng, there’s still ground for reconciliation here. I have no intention to take your life. It’s just that your soul is of use to me. Surrender obediently, and I’ll spare your friends. What do you think?” Master Yin Ren asked.&nbsp;

“How do you want me to do?” Chu Feng asked.

“Simple. I’ll construct another formation. I want you to enter Princess Xiaoxiao’s soul once more and do what I asked you to,” Master Yin Ren replied.

“I doubt that you want my soul to treat Princess Xiaoxiao’s illness. It was likely also an intentional move on your part to raise my spirit power. What is your goal?” Chu Feng asked.

“Heh… Surely a man as smart as you are can figure it out by yourself?” Master Yin Ren replied with an evil smile.&nbsp;

The contrast between the benevolent appearance he put on earlier and his current attitude was truly chilling. A terrifying aura enveloped the area, leaving Chu Feng and the others unnerved.&nbsp;

None of them had the power to escape from the encirclement of the terrifying aura.

“Brat, looks like you’re in need of help?”

A familiar voice suddenly echoed in Chu Feng’s ears, sending a delighted jolt through his body.

“Elder, you’re willing to help me?” Chu Feng asked excitedly.

The one who had talked to him was none other than the Divine Deer.

Even though Master Yin Ren had sealed off the area with his tremendous strength, Chu Feng was still confident that they would be able to escape from here with the Divine Deer’s help.

The Divine Deer didn’t respond to Chu Feng’s question, but a familiar surge of energy started rising from within Chu Feng’s body. It was the Divine Deer’s power.

“Hm?”

Master Yin Ren noticed the changes in Chu Feng, and he turned his gaze over.

“Heed my advice, Chu Feng. Don’t try to play any tricks and obediently surrender,” Master Yin Ren warned.&nbsp;

“Heh…”&nbsp;

However, Chu Feng sneered disdainfully in response to Master Yin Ren’s warning.

“Fool.”

Sensing that something was amiss, Master Yin Ren quickly channeled his spirit power to form a binding formation to trap Chu Feng in place.

Shoosh!

There was a sudden flash of light before he could make a move.

Master Yin Ren froze up and Princess Xiaoxiao was dumbstruck.&nbsp;

They realized that Chu Feng, Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Buyu, and Shengguang Baimei had all vanished from sight!

“What was that earlier? Did Chu Feng wield such power within him?”&nbsp;

Master Yin Ren quickly scanned his surroundings as he reassessed the situation. He didn’t think that Chu Feng would have the ability to escape from his grasp.&nbsp;

However, after a momentary bout of shock, he didn’t get too angry about it. Instead, a sinister smile formed on his lips.

“That makes things much more interesting,” Master Yin Ren said as he licked his lips.

He was a completely different person from before, as if someone had swapped the amicable master world spiritist inside him with a malevolent demon.&nbsp;

“Master Yin Ren, when did you reach your current level? What were you planning to do with Chu Feng’s soul?” Princess Xiaoxiao asked.&nbsp;

It would appear that she didn’t have a deep understanding of Master Yin Ren either.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, you should know better than to stick your head into places where it doesn’t belong.”

Master Yin Ren suddenly turned around to look at Princess Xiaoxiao.&nbsp;

When Princess Xiaoxiao caught sight of the look on Master Yin Ren’s face, she subconsciously staggered several steps back. There weren’t any changes in Master Yin Ren’s appearance, but the look in his eyes and his attitude were completely different from the kind master world spiritist she was familiar with.&nbsp;

She felt appalled by the changes that had come over Master Yin Ren.

Shoosh!

A person suddenly appeared by the horizon and quickly landed in their vicinity. Upon seeing the face of the figure, Princess Xiaoxiao, who had just distanced herself from Master Yin Ren, anxiously hid behind Master Yin Ren’s back once more.

She recognized the person.

It was none other than the Wretched Black Demon!!!

“What are you doing here?” Princess Xiaoxiao questioned warily.

However, the Wretched Black Demon ignored Princess Xiaoxiao’s questions and continued walking toward them. This left Princess Xiaoxiao incredibly nervous.

The Wretched Black Demon was simply too infamous that she couldn’t help but worry even though Master Yin Ren had displayed prowess far greater than she had expected. She wasn’t certain whether Master Yin Ren truly had the strength to deal with the Wretched Black Demon or not.&nbsp;

However, what happened next left her utterly shocked and confused.&nbsp;

Upon walking up to them, the Wretched Black Demon suddenly fell to his knees and cried out, “Your humble servant, Wretched Black Demon, pays respects to Milord!”
