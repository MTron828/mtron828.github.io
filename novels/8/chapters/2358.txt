Chapter 2358 - The Most Dangerous Individual

The surging oppressive might sealed off heaven and earth.

With imposing power, a figure soon appeared from the sky. That person descended before Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.

That person was an old monk.

That old monk was very thin. His clothes were very worn. The patches to mend the holes in his clothes made it seem like they were the clothes of a beggar.

However, when that old monk appeared, not a single person dared to despise him.

This was especially true for those people that had deliberately made things difficult for Chu Feng earlier. At that moment, they were all frowning and shivering in fear.

The reason for that was because everyone present was able to guess that the old monk was the owner of that powerful oppressive might, that the old monk was not only a True Immortal, but also an extraordinary True Immortal.

“Senior, it’s you?” Chu Feng was immediately overjoyed upon seeing that old monk. The reason for that was because he knew that old monk.

That old monk was precisely the same old monk Chu Feng encountered in the Darknight Ghost Forest. Speaking of it, Chu Feng possessed a slight relationship with that old monk.

“Little friend Chu Feng, rest assured. With me here, no one will dare to harm you in the slightest. In fact, no one will be able to harm you in the slightest,” The old monk turned around and smiled lightly at Chu Feng. His attitude was very amiable.

Upon seeing that scene, the World Spiritist Saintess, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s peak Martial Ancestor and the others shouted ‘Oh no!’ in their hearts. They started to feel that they were on the verge of death.

After all, judging from the way things were, Chu Feng most definitely possessed an extraordinary relationship with that old monk.

“Senior, please don’t misunderstand. We never planned to do anything to little friend Chu Feng. We merely...”

Sensing that the situation was bad, that Kong Heavenly Clan’s peak Martial Ancestor who acted to attack Chu Feng earlier hurriedly tried to explain.

He had a very attentive expression on his face. He was trying to provide an excuse so as to not be punished by the old monk.

However, before he could finish saying his excuses, the old monk’s gaze suddenly changed. Then, a strange light flickered.

“Puu~~~”

The very next moment, that Kong Heavenly Clan’s peak Martial Ancestor vomited out a mouthful of blood. Then, he fell to his knees powerlessly.

He started to shiver and was unable to utter a word. His appearance was akin to that of a dying individual. He became so weak that it was strange.

Upon seeing what had happened to the Kong Heavenly Clan’s peak Martial Ancestor, the World Spiritist Saintess and the others grew even more frightened.

“This man’s cultivation is still present. However, for the rest of his life, he will only be able to stay at peak Martial Ancestor. No longer will he have the opportunity to reach the True Immortal realm.”

“What?!”

The crowd were once again frightened upon hearing those words. To be able to seal off a person’s future prospects with a single attack, that sort of strength was truly frightening.

The crowd were all scared that they would end up suffering the same fate as that peak Martial Ancestor.

“That is his punishment for attacking little friend Chu Feng.”

“However, I dare to guarantee that if anyone dares to attack little friend Chu Feng again in the future, then their punishment will most definitely not be as light. I will personally make sure that those individuals will suffer a fate worse than death, and live lives inferior to those of pigs and dogs.”

The old monk said those words so very indifferently. There was not the slightest trace of anger in his tone. However, his words possessed unimaginable impact as they entered the crowd’s ears. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Everyone knew that he was not joking around. The reason for that was because he truly possessed the strength to do so.

“Three little friends, farewell.”

After he finished saying those words, the old monk turned around and smiled profoundly at Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. Then, his body shifted slightly, and he disappeared into thin air.

After that old monk disappeared, his enormous oppressive might that was stifling the crowd also disappeared.

After the old monk left, that region grew calm again.

However, no one was certain as to whether or not that old monk had truly left. Thus, at that moment, the crowd were all standing there in a stunned manner. They were at a complete loss as for what to do. Their hearts were still restless.

“Little friend Chu Feng, we truly did not have any ill intentions earlier. Please do not take offense.”

After some time passed, the crowd managed to ease their tension and began to apologize to Chu Feng. At that moment, their attitude toward Chu Feng had changed completely.

The reason for that was because they came to know that Chu Feng truly possessed a True Immortal-level expert protecting him. Furthermore, this True Immortal-level expert was no ordinary True Immortal. He was so powerful that the crowd were all terrified of him.

Chu Feng ignored the crowd’s apologies and instead asked with a beaming smile, “Seniors, are you all going to continue to prevent us from leaving?”

At that moment, the crowd all smiled wryly. They were feeling very awkward.

They all knew that Chu Feng was making cutting remarks at them. However, even though they knew that was the case, they did not dare to show the slightest trace of displeasure.

“In that case, farewell.”

Chu Feng clasped his fist at the crowd. Even though it was an act of etiquette, it was filled with mockery. This caused the so-called experts present to feel even more ashamed. One by one, they lowered their heads.

“Humph,” Seeing the shamed expressions of the crowd, the corners of Chu Feng’s mouth lifted into a cold grin.

With what had happened here today, Chu Feng had managed to see through these people. This bunch, including that Grandmaster Prophet and Elder Duan Chunchang, were truly a bunch of hypocrites. In short, not a single person from the group present here today was straightforward and upright.

After mocking the crowd, Chu Feng’s body suddenly shifted. Then, he soared into the sky. Together with Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, the three of them flew towards the distant sky.

Although Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had left, the remaining crowd did not leave after a long time. The reason for that was because they still possessed lingering fear, and were at a loss as for what to do.

However, they were certain of one thing. Their conduct and deeds towards Chu Feng today seemed to have left them quite a large grievance.

“Everyone, I believe you are all feeling very unreconciled right now. However, I urge you all that it is best to not make little friend Chu Feng your enemy.”

“The strength of that individual earlier most likely surpasses your imaginations. Not to mention you all, likely even the powers behind you would not be able to afford to offend that individual,” Grandmaster Prophet said.

Once Grandmaster Prophet’s words were said, the crowd’s hearts shook.

What sort of individuals were the people present? The four tier one powers were all present. As such, what Grandmaster Prophet meant was that that old monk was an existence that not even the four tier one powers could afford to offend. His evaluation was truly high, truly frightening.

Curious, Elder Duan Chunchang asked, “Grandmaster, exactly what is the cultivation of that individual?”

“I possess the same cultivation as you. When you are unable to see through his cultivation, how could I?”

“Merely, I had a premonition earlier. Although that premonition was very vague, that premonition told me that that individual is a very dangerous character,” Grandmaster Prophet said.

“How dangerous?” The crowd asked in unison.

“More dangerous than anyone I’ve encountered in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Grandmaster Prophet said.

“Sssss~~~” Hearing those words, the crowd sucked in a mouthful of cold air.

What sort of character was Grandmaster Prophet? In terms of cultivation, although his cultivation was powerful, he was still only a peak Martial Ancestor. When compared to those True Immortal-level experts, Grandmaster Prophet could not be considered to be worth much.

However, Grandmaster Prophet held an unrivalled status. Thus, practically all of the strongest experts in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would have to give him face. As such, Grandmaster Prophet had met the majority of those experts too.

Thus, the evaluation Grandmaster Prophet gave that monk was truly high.

Grandmaster Prophet’s evaluation came like the ring of a bell to the crowd. That said, the one that was feeling most depressed right now was none other than the World Spiritist Saintess.

She knew very well that the others present did not have a deep grievance with Chu Feng. As long as they tried to reconcile with him, they would definitely be able to eventually do so.

However, she was different; she was unable to reconcile with Chu Feng. Thus, she was feeling an enormous headache. After all, Chu Feng’s backing was simply too frightening.

It was as if there was an insurmountable mountain blocking the path between her and Chu Feng. That mountain caused her to be at a complete loss as for what to do.

......

At the moment when those experts were pondering how to amend their relationship with Chu Feng, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had already left the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.

“Chu Feng, who was that old monk? He seems to be very powerful,” Zhao Hong asked.

“T-that’s right, brother. I t-truly never expected t-that you had a-actually found such a backer. No w-wonder you were so c-calm f-facing those hypocrites,” Wang Qiang had an excited expression. After all, they had nearly suffered a calamity earlier.

“That senior and I only met a couple times. I do not know him very well. I am extremely surprised that he was willing to help save us.”

“I feel that he will not continue to protect me forever. Thus, we cannot place our hopes on him saving us again. In the future, it is best that we rely on ourselves,” Chu Feng said.

Although Chu Feng was unable to detect that old monk’s whereabouts, Chu Feng felt that the old monk had already left. He felt that what the old monk said earlier was merely meant to scare the crowd. He did not plan to protect Chu Feng forever.

“It is better to rely on oneself than to rely on others. What Chu Feng says is very true,” Zhao Hong said approvingly.

“The news of us obtaining Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance will soon be spread. Likely, there will be a lot of people that will come to attack us. We must be extremely careful,” Chu Feng said.

“But, w-we can’t c-continue to h-hide forever,” Wang Qiang said.

“Of course. We must still do what we ought to do,” Chu Feng said.

“Then, let’s go and find the treasures left behind by Grandmaster Kai Hong. Perhaps they might be of help to us,” Zhao Hong said.

“W-which p-place first?” Wang Qiang asked.

“Mine is extremely difficult. As for Chu Feng’s, it seems to be even more difficult. After all, our relationship with the Kong Heavenly Clan is not good right now.”

“Thus, let’s go and obtain yours first,” Zhao Hong said to Wang Qiang.

“Brother, w-what do you t-think?” Wang Qiang asked Chu Feng.

“I agree with Zhao Hong,” Chu Feng said.

“T-then, it’s d-decided,” Wang Qiang smiled.

Then, Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang began to proceed toward the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond.

Although the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond was not as dangerous as the Phoenix Flame City, it still remained one of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s forbidden areas.
