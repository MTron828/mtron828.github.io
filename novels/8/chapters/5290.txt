Chapter 5290: Ancestral Martial Has Never Faltered

“I didn’t know that someone like you is protecting young friend Chu Feng. I was slow-witted,” Mo Chengzhou said.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist frowned. Hostility seeped into his eyes as he asked, “Oh? It sounds like you have probed my disciple to see if there’s anyone behind him?”

Mo Chengzhou didn’t answer, but the unease on his face deepened.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly burst into laughter.

“Hahaha! That would explain why you had no fear scheming against my disciple. It looks like you have already scouted him out!”

Boom!

Mo Chengzhou suddenly made his move. A flood of aura gushed out from his palm, unleashing a destructive might that obliterated everything in its path. Even space temporarily collapsed before its power.

By the time the flood of aura vanished, the realm had already been divided into two.

The side where Mo Chengzhou was standing in was still intact, but everything on the other side had been reduced to the void. Countless cracks could be seen in the distant horizon. This realm was supposed to be nigh indestructible, but it was already on the verge of collapse due to the earlier attack.

This was an attack that could completely obliterate a Lower Realm without leaving anything behind!

From the moment the Ox-nosed Old Daoist revealed his identity, Mo Chengzhou had already known that it would be impossible to resolve matters here peacefully. On top of that, the other party appeared to possess extraordinary means.

His only chance was to catch the Ox-nosed Old Daoist off guard.

Fearing that his own strength wouldn’t be enough, he even used a treasure for the attack.

Mo Chengzhou fell to the ground and desperately gasped for air. Even moving the slightest was a huge strain for him in his current state. That was the price he had to pay for his attack. Nevertheless, his face lit up in joy when he looked at the devastation before him, especially when he couldn’t sense the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s aura anywhere in the realm anymore.

“Heh… I was still wondering how formidable he was, sneaking into my realm without my notice, but it turns out he’s nothing but a paper tiger. He probably used a treasure to stop me from leaving this realm earlier. It’s a pity that my earlier strike has obliterated everything, or else that would have been a useful treasure to acquire.” Mo Chengzhou shook his head in regret.

“Wow. You sure are confident.”

A person suddenly floated up amidst the void. It was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

He was still wearing the same tattered clothes as before, but what was horrifying was that he looked no different from before. There wasn’t even an additional drop of sweat on him.

“You!!!” Mo Chengzhou looked as if his mother had just died before his eyes.

“What else do you have? Bring it all out,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

Mo Chengzhou was rendered speechless. The earlier attack had already taken everything that he had. He had no idea whether the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had escaped the attack or took it face-on, but in any case…

It was clear that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was an enemy beyond his means to deal with.

He gathered all of his energy to rise into the air, hoping to make a getaway. However, a powerful force suddenly pressed down on him, thrusting him back into the ground.

Boom!

A cloud of dust rose. A huge pit had formed in the ground, and Mo Chengzhou lay sprawled at its very bottom.

“I told you to show me what you got, not to escape. How meaningless.” The Ox-nosed Old Daoist floated over and gazed down at Mo Chengzhou with a vicious smile on his lips.

Mo Chengzhou forced himself to turn his head over to look at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. There was no anger on his face, just desperation. “Milord, I was the one who did all of this. I’m willing to accept any fate. But this has nothing to do with my son or my granddaughter!”

He knew that he was doomed, but he didn’t want to implicate his son and his granddaughter in this.

“Oh?”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist flicked his wrist and conjured a gate inside the realm. It was the gate covered in talismans. Somehow, the gate that should have been outside the realm had appeared in here.

“Spatial inversion?”

Mo Chengzhou was shocked. He did know that he wasn’t a match for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, but he didn’t think that there would be such a huge gap in their strength.

Bam!

The gate filled with talismans opened, and the coffin instantaneously shattered. A dried corpse floated out, but shockingly, the corpse was still breathing!

“Milord, I’m begging you! Please spare my son! He’s innocent!” Mo Chengzhou cried.

“I sense demonic energy. Your son has cultivated a demonic skill. I reckon that he must have harmed a lot of people back when he was still alive. On top of that, you took the bloodlines of so many world spiritist juniors to sustain his life. Your son… doesn’t deserve to live.”

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist tightened his grasp, and a loud ‘kacha’ echoed. The corpse’s head abruptly jerked sideway. and it stopped breathing.

Mo Chengzhou’s eyes widened in horror. Unimaginable killing intent began surging from him.

Intense black flames emerged on his body, burning with such fervor that it wouldn’t be long before he was reduced to cinders. However, through this sacrifice, he was able to acquire extremely great power. He rose into the sky and charged at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

“I’ll kill you!” he roared as he hurled a punch out.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn’t bother to block the punch, allowing it to strike him squarely in the face.

A powerful shockwave rippled. Space shattered and the realm was reduced to a void. The only ones standing remaining in this void were Mo Chengzhou and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Everything fell eerily silent.

The black flames and killing intent had receded from Mo Chengzhou, and even his rage had been quelled. They had been replaced by boundless despair. With a loud ‘putong’, he kneeled down before the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist stood unharmed on the spot. In comparison, Mo Chengzhou’s fist had been reduced to meat must, and every single one of his tendons had snapped. His entire arm had turned into a bloodied mess.

Mo Chengzhou suddenly hugged the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s thigh and said, “Milord, I admit defeat. I am not your match. My son and I indeed deserve death. But I’m begging you, please spare my granddaughter. She has never committed any sins!”

He humbly pleaded amidst sobs. Never in his life had he been so subservient before.

“Your granddaughter can live. I’ll also grant you the dignity of a full corpse,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Thank you, milord!” Mo Chengzhou kowtowed in gratitude.

“Any last words?” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.

Mo Chengzhou visibly froze up as many thoughts ran through his mind. A moment later, he asked, “Milord, I have no last words, but there is something I would like to ask.”

“Go ahead,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.

“Ten thousand years ago, I participated in an expedition against the Eastern Region. There were many experts from top powers inside the expedition, and our goal was to steal the Eastern Region’s remnants once and for all. However, our plan was thwarted by a mysterious expert. We were hardly the strongest existence in the vast world of cultivation, but we weren’t pushovers either. Yet, we found ourselves completely helpless against that mysterious expert.

“Since then, there had been very few experts who dared to visit the Eastern Region, especially the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Beneath the contempt we express toward the Eastern Region lies deep fear. Even now, whenever I recall about that mysterious expert’s prowess, my heart would shudder and my blood would run wild. I don’t even revere my own sectmaster, but I revered that mysterious expert.

“Thus, I’d like to ask if you were the mysterious expert who protected the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,” Mo Chengzhou asked as he clenched his fists in agitation.

He didn’t think that it would be a shame if he died in the hands of a person he revered. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Ten thousand years ago? That’s a long time ago. I have protected the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but that probably wasn’t me,” the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.

“Ah?” Mo Chengzhou froze up in horror. A frightening realization struck him.

The Ox-nosed Old Daoist chuckled softly. “It’s exactly what you’re thinking. I am not the only one protecting the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.”

A complicated smile emerged on Mo Chengzhou’s face.

“I see. The Ancestral Martial Galaxy has never faltered before.”

Blood suddenly spurted from his seven apertures, and his body began descending with uncontrollable momentum. All signs of life had vanished from him. He had committed suicide.
