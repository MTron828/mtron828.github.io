Chapter 5475: Brewing Trouble

In the Armory Hall’s main hall, the Totem Dragon Clansmen stood rooted to the spot, looking at each other with conflicted expressions. None of them dared to carelessly step into the main hall even though it had already returned to normalcy and the transparent barrier had shattered.

“What’s wrong? What happened to the main hall?” a familiar voice echoed.

Two silhouettes appeared in the main hall. It was Long Chengyu and Long Muxi.

Long Muxi rushed up to Chu Feng and asked, “Are you fine?”

“I’m fine.”

“Why did you come here? Did something happen over on your side?” Chu Feng asked.

He was worried that the affairs here had hindered the taming of their God Armaments. He would be filled with self-reproach if that was the case.

“Don’t worry, Chu Feng. My big sister and I have already tamed our God Armaments,” Long Chengyu replied.

The Totem Dragon Clansmen in the main hall widened their eyes. Some looked envious, but most were happy for them. Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were the future of the Totem Dragon Clan, after all. Their success was a good thing for their clan.

There were naturally people who thought differently too, such as Long Yuhong. She didn’t mind Long Chengyu taming a God Armament, but she didn’t want to see Long Muxi succeed too.

“What happened here?” Long Chengyu asked the juniors present.

“Young master Chengyu, why don’t you ask Chu Feng instead?” Long Zhizhi, Long Xu’s granddaughter, pointed her finger at Chu Feng and scoffed.

Long Chengyu and Long Muxi turned their gazes to Chu Feng.

“My apologies, I have caused you trouble,” Chu Feng said with a bitter smile.

He proceeded to explain the situation that had transpired here earlier, but he stopped short of revealing his deduction.

“Oh? Brother Chu Feng woke up Lord Silver Dragon Spear? No wonder Lord Silver Dragon Spear has been sealed off by a formation. It looks like my clan has prepared a countermeasure to prevent outsiders from taming Lord Silver Dragon Spear. These countermeasures are likely prepared by my ancestors and are not targeted at you. Brother Chu Feng, I hope that you don’t take this to heart,” Long Chengyu consoled Chu Feng instead of blaming him.

Chu Feng felt heartened to hear those words. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I wouldn’t take it to heart. I feel guilt-ridden for having troubled you and your clan,” Chu Feng replied.

“It’s no trouble at all. I was the one who invited you here. If anything, I’m amazed by your ability to win the recognition of all of the God Armaments and cause such a ruckus. It proves that I have made the right choice by befriending you,” Long Chengyu replied with a smile.

He looked like he was still trying to come to terms with what had just happened, but he quickly turned to the juniors behind him and said, “What are you waiting for? The main hall has already reverted to normal. Go in and commune with the God Armaments!”

It was only then that the juniors finally dared to step into the main hall. The earlier commotion was simply too frightening. If they had been in the main hall, there was a good chance that they would have been dead now.

Chu Feng looked at the juniors entering the main hall with a conflicted look on his face, but he chose not to voice his reservations aloud. He didn’t think that they would trust his words until they experienced it themselves.

“Brother Chu Feng, why don’t you head in too? You don’t need to be too bothered by what happened earlier. You have to commune with those God Armaments in order to tame them. You shouldn’t miss this opportunity,” Long Chengyu said.

“It’s fine. These God Armaments won’t be acknowledging me anymore,” Chu Feng replied.

“Oh?” The juniors looked at Chu Feng.

“What’s going on?” Long Muxi asked with a hint of rage.

She thought that the Totem Dragon Clan had pulled some strings to hinder Chu Feng from taming any of the God Armaments using the formation. To allow him into the Armory Hall but stopping him from taming a God Armament was no different from making a fool out of him!

“Brother Chu Feng, is it the doing of our clan’s formation?” Long Chengyu asked.

His smile had faded too. While he might appear doltish at times, he was, by no means, a fool. He had also guessed what might have happened.

“That’s not it. Do you see those runes on the God Armaments? The Silver Dragon Spear appears to have done something to them right before it was sealed off,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you saying that those runes have sealed off the God Armaments, preventing them from acknowledging a master?” Long Chengyu asked.

“Yes, that’s what I think,” Chu Feng replied.

“You bastard!” Long Zhizhi furiously pointed her finger at Chu Feng. “Chu Feng, you deserve to die a thousand times over!”

“Calm down. Those runes are targeted at me. It has no effects on you,” Chu Feng said.

“You’re lying! Why are the God Armaments not reacting to us if those runes are only targeted at you?” Long Zhizhi questioned.

“None of the weapons are reacting at all!”

“Chu Feng has sabotaged us!”

The other juniors reproached Chu Feng, though they didn’t confront him as Long Zhizhi did.

Before Chu Feng could reply, Long Muxi had already spoken up, “Isn’t that normal? Did the God Armament react to any of you previously?”

“Big sister Muxi, you can’t compare those two situations. Our clan expended a lot of resources to construct a formation so that we can better tame the God Armaments!” Long Zhizhi said.

“The formation has stalled to a halt,” Chu Feng said.

“What? The formation has stalled to a halt? But we haven’t communed with the God Armaments yet! This was supposed to be an opportunity for us!”

The juniors were shocked.

“This is your fault too. Such a situation wouldn’t have happened if not for you! You really deserve to die, Chu Feng. How dare someone like you…” Long Zhizhi reprimanded.

“Shut up,” Long Chengyu snapped. “Chu Feng is my guest.”

Long Chengyu’s outburst forced Long Zhizhi to calm down, but she was still reluctant to give in. “Young master Chengyu, you are the young master of our Totem Dragon Clan. Have you forgotten your vow to prioritize the interests of the clan above all things else?”

Long Zhizhi waved her sleeves before taking her leave. She didn’t forget to shoot a dirty glare at Chu Feng.

“Young master Chengyu, we’ll be taking our leave.”

The other juniors left the Armory Hall too. Their earlier excitement had faded to disappointment, and they made sure to direct a hostile glare at Chu Feng before walking away.

Chu Feng didn’t respond to their hostility. While he didn’t intend to stir trouble, there was no denying that he was the cause of this mishap, and it left him feeling a little guilt-ridden.

“My apologies,” Chu Feng said.

“You don’t need to feel guilty about this. You didn’t do anything wrong,” Long Chengyu replied with a smile.

Long Muxi was surprised to hear those words. She didn’t think that her younger brother would take such a magnanimous attitude toward Chu Feng.

The three of them left the Armory Hall together.

As soon as they stepped out of the Armory Hall, they noticed that the colossal formation around this realm had significantly dimmed. Furthermore, there were ten thousand elites from the Totem Dragon Clan standing neatly outside.

“Paying respects to young master Chengyu and young miss Muxi,” the elites quickly greeted with a bow.

“Why are you here?” Long Chengyu asked the leader of the elites.

“Young master, we have come here under Lord Long Xu’s command to invite young friend Chu Feng to our side palace,” the leader of the elites replied.

“They are clearly up to something,” Eggy said with a worried frown.

Chu Feng currently didn’t have the strength to oppose the Totem Dragon Clan yet.

Before Chu Feng could answer, Long Chengyu placed his hand on Chu Feng’s shoulder and smiled. “Don’t worry, I’m here.”
