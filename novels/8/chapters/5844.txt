Chapter 5845: The Identity of the Culprit

Chapter 5845: The Identity of the Culprit

“There’s someone stronger than Huangfu Shengyu in the Ancient Era’s clans? What’s that person’s cultivation level?” Chu Feng asked.

“I heard Huangfu Shengyu once challenged all of the top prodigies of the Ancient Era’s clans. He won most of the battles, but Tuoba Yijian defeated him with a single slash,” Zhao Gongyi replied.

“Tuoba Yijian?” Chu Feng’s heart skipped a beat. He had heard that name before.

He had not only met Zhang Yingxiong at the Nine Realms Immortal Region; he had also encountered two extremely powerful youths. One was Tuoba Tianxue, and the other was Tuoba Yijian.

He waved his sleeves and conjured a portrait of Tuoba Yijian with his spirit power.

“Is it him?” Chu Feng asked.

“Yes, that’s him. Do you know him?” Zhao Gongyi asked.

“He’s a junior?”

“Of course he’s a junior. He’s even younger than me.”

However, Chu Feng remembered Tuoba Yijian telling him that he wasn’t a junior, though it wouldn’t be surprising for Tuoba Yijian to lie since they were practically strangers, not to mention they were from the Ancient Era’s clans.

Being at rank eight Half-God level, Tuoba Yijian was stronger than all of the juniors in the present era. He would have to lie about his age if he didn’t want to reveal his identity.

Chu Feng conjured yet another portrait. It was Tuoba Tianxue this time around.

“Do you know him?” Chu Feng asked.

“I... have never seen him before,” Zhao Gongyi said.

“Speak the truth,” Chu Feng said.

He rattled the martial power chain, evoking screams of pain. It was not just Zhao Gongyi who was suffering but the other five prodigies too.

“I know him, I know him!” the woman from the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan raised her hand and spoke with a warped face.

“Go on,” Chu Feng urged.

“He’s Tuoba Tianxue, a junior from the Empyrean Sword Sacred Palace. He’s said to be even stronger than Tuoba Yijian,” the woman from the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan said.

“Are the two of them here?” Chu Feng asked.

“No, the Empyrean Sword Sacred Palace didn’t participate in this operation,” the woman replied.

“Is Tuoba Tianxue the strongest junior of the Ancient Era’s clans?” Chu Feng asked.

This was the one thing he had to verify, especially since the juniors of the Ancient Era’s clans harbored hostility toward the juniors of the present era. This likely had something to do with the education they had received from their respective families, so their enmity was not just their own but their clans’.

There was likely to be a battle between the Ancient Era and the present era in the future, so it was important for Chu Feng to uncover the strength of his potential rivals.

“I recognize Tuoba Tianxue, but I’m not sure if he’s the strongest. Those from the Empyrean Sword Sacred Palace rarely reveal themselves, so I don’t know their background. Furthermore, we don’t have the means to contact all of the Ancient Era’s clans,” the woman said. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Do you know what Tuoba Yijian and Tuoba Tianxue’s cultivation levels are?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know,” the woman replied.

“Which Ancient Era’s clans are currently active in the present era?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know much. Other than our six Ancient Era’s clans, the only ones I know are the Huangfu Heavenly Clan and the Empyrean Sword Sacred Palace,” the woman said.

“What cultivation level is the strongest expert involved in this operation?” Chu Feng asked.

“I-I don’t know.” The woman lowered her head.

Her reluctance to face him and her subtle expressions made Chu Feng realize she was lying.

Before Chu Feng could make a move, Zhao Gongyi suddenly spoke up, “I know, I know! My grandfather, the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master, is at Heavenly God level. He’s currently right outside the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,

“Other than my grandfather, there’s the Tuoba Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the Myriad Night Ancient Sect’s sectmaster, Nine Regions Divine Hall’s hall Master, Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s Clan Chief, and the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. They are all at Heavenly God level too, and they are here too.

“We have made ample preparations, and we’d surely take down the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Chu Feng, I have already told you everything I know, so please don’t kill me. There’s no way you can protect the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. If you kill me, my grandfather won’t let you off.”

Zhao Gongyi was threatening Chu Feng, but his attitude was not as tough and arrogant as before. Rather, he sounded subservient, almost as if he was tearfully begging Chu Feng.

“Zhao Gongyi, you coward!” The prodigy from the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan gritted his teeth in anger when he saw how Zhao Gongyi unhesitatingly revealed everything.

However, Zhao Gongyi didn’t feel ashamed at all. Instead, he looked at the other five prodigies and hollered, “As if the rest of you aren’t afraid of death! What’s wrong with me finding a way to survive? My grandfather wouldn’t want me to die, and it’s likely the same for the rest of you too. It’s meaningless for us to act tough here. Rather, we should be finding a way to live. That’s what our family members would want for us.”

Pah!

Chu Feng slapped Zhao Gongyi, sending the latter tumbling across the ground. “I’m asking you a question. I didn’t tell you to argue.”

“I was wrong, I was wrong!” Zhao Gongyi kneeled and kowtowed.

“What’s the cultivation level of your grandfather and the others?” Chu Feng asked.

“Rank one Heavenly God level. They are all rank one Heavenly God level!” Zhao Gongyi said.

“Are they really at rank one Heavenly God Level?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s true!” Zhao Gongyi exclaimed.

“Why are they relying on a formation instead of directly making a move then?” Chu Feng asked.

Based on what he had observed, the immense protective formation shrouding the Ancestral Martial Galaxy had yet to reach rank one Heavenly God level.

While they did employ the black light pillar, it was a special means with many restrictions. Only juniors could travel through the black light pillar, and the destination was fixed in this realm.

On top of that, the key source of energy behind the formation attacking the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation had exceeded pinnacle True God level, but it hadn’t reached the level of a Heavenly God yet.

This made Chu Feng curious as to why none of the Heavenly Gods had made a move when there were six of them here. It seemed inefficient for them to rely on formations.

“I’m not sure, but it’s Puppeteer Exalted’s command,” Zhao Gongyi said.

“How strong is Puppeteer Exalted? Which Ancient Era’s clan is he from?” Chu Feng asked.

The Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild’s Guild Leader had told him about Puppeteer Exalted while explaining the situation to him, so Chu Feng knew Puppeteer Exalted was the mastermind who orchestrated this attack on the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

“I’m not sure how strong Puppeteer Exalted is, but he doesn’t seem to be from the Ancient Era. Furthermore...”

“Furthermore what?”

“Based on what I have heard, Puppeteer Exalted used many formations exclusive to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion when he previously worked with our Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion. However, he said he wasn’t from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion; he had only learned their formations out of coincidence,” Zhao Gongyi said.

“The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? Could it be him?” Chu Feng raised his head and looked into the distance.

Even with Chu Feng’s strength, he was unable to see the origin of the black light pillar. Nevertheless, he had thought of a possibility.

Puppeteer Exalted might just be his maternal grandfather, Jie Tianran. Now that he thought about it, Jie Tianran had a motive to attack the Ancestral Martial Galaxy too.
