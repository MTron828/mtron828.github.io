Chapter 4866: Shatter Your Honor

“Young hero Chu Feng, you’re a talented person. It’s the blessing of our Holy Light Clan and the entire Holy Light Galaxy if we could make peace!”

Shengguang Haifu and Shengguang Yunyue were delighted to hear that news. The thought that they could finally be freed from the devil’s clutches filled them with relief.

“It would be the best if that’s what you really think. Alright, the two of you should rest up. Don’t even try to play tricks on me, or else I’ll make you suffer dearly for it,” Chu Feng said.

“There’s no way we would attempt anything!” Shengguang Haifu exclaimed in response.

“That’s for the best,” Chu Feng said with a meaningful smile before heading out.

He didn’t leave the carriage but the barrier where he had trapped Shengguang Haifu and Shenggaung Yunyue in, but in the eyes of those two, it looked like Chu Feng had left the carriage and walked a long distance away.

As soon as they realized that Chu Feng was gone, they began assessing the carriage around them. They realized that the carriage was filled with food and recovery pills that were clearly specially prepared for them.

Upon seeing this, Shengguang Haifu secretly took out a pearl and formed a series of hand seals. The pearl immediately released an invisible aura that sealed off the area around the two of them.

It was a treasure that isolated sound.

“Lord Yunyue, we can talk now. Chu Feng won’t be able to hear us,” Shengguang Haifu said.

The two of them had already talked to one another during the time they were sealed off in Chu Feng’s gourd. By this point, Shengguang Haifu no longer harbored any grudge toward Shengguang Yunyue for what she did back then. On the contrary, he regained his respect for her.

“Shengguang Haifu, you sure learn quick. You were so fawning that I nearly thought that you were going to betray our clan.”

Shengguang Yunyue looked at him with a displeased look on her face.

“Lord Yunyue, I’m doing this so that we’ll at least be able to avoid some suffering. That Chu Feng is really out of his mind. It’s as if there’s nothing he wouldn’t stoop to. We have no choice but to lie low for the time being until we can turn the tables on him,” Shengguang Haifu replied.

“Alright alright, I understand. Just make sure that no one else finds out about this,” Shengguang Yunyue said.

“Lord Yunyue, I won’t tell another soul. Do you think Chu Feng really meant it when he said that he’s intending to make peace with our clan? Is it possible that he’s up to something?” Shengguang Haifu asked doubtfully.

“That’s hard to say. Chu Feng is a smart person. He’s a talented cultivator, but it doesn’t look like he has fully matured yet. At least for the time being, he isn’t a match for our Holy Light Clan yet.

“Not to mention, he’s on good terms with Long Xiaoxiao too. He’s worried about the Dragon Clan, but he doesn’t have the power to protect it yet. Under such circumstances, it’s understandable that he might propose a ceasefire,” Shengguang Yunyue replied.

“Hmph! Even if he wants to reconcile with us, our clan chief will never agree to it!” Shengguang Haifu harrumphed.

He knew just what kind of person Shengguang Xuanye was.

“Of course he won’t. That brat is too arrogant to think that he can get his way. He probably doesn’t know that he’s charging straight into the gates of death!

“I concede that his talent is frightening. I’ve never seen a junior as terrifying as he is. However, talented people tend to get complacent easily, and that’s the case with Chu Feng. He thinks that he’s a special existence in this world, having the backing of the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. He thinks that no one dares to touch him.

“Little does he know that he isn’t a match for our clan chief at all. Our Holy Light Clan doesn’t fear him! Does he think that our Holy Light Clan will let him go after everything he has done to challenge our authority? Hah, he’s making light of us!

“I begged him to kill me back then, but he refused to do it. It looks like I really should thank him for his ‘mercy’ now. At the very least, I’ll be able to see him falling into ruins in the hands of our clan. I’ll ask the clan chief to leave that brat to me, and I’ll show him what living hell looks like!” Shengguang Yunyue spat furiously.

The killing intent in her eyes was frightening.

“Yes, we’ll make him regret his actions. Doesn’t that brat treasure his friends? Since that’s the case, I’ll capture everyone related to him and slowly slice off their flesh right in front of him! Since he dares to torture me, I’ll torture everyone he cares about!” Shengguang Haifu declared grandly.

Those two vile elders might have acted subserviently before Chu Feng earlier, but they had already made up their mind as to how they intended to exact vengeance on him.

“What interesting ploys the two of you have come up with!”

Chu Feng’s voice suddenly boomed in the air.

Following that, his silhouette appeared in front of them.

“Y-you... Didn’t you leave the carriage?!”

Shengguang Yunyue and Shengguang Haifu’s faces turned ghastly pale. They immediately realized that they had just doomed themselves, and their first thought was to escape from this place right away.

The problem was that they couldn’t.

“Leave the carriage? That’s no more than an illusion formation I’ve constructed! I’ve been sitting here all this while, listening to the two of you plotting your vengeance,” Chu Feng sneered.

“Y-young hero Chu Feng, we were just shooting our mouths. How could we possibly dare to do anything to you? You mustn’t take our words seriously!”

Shengguang Haifu immediately fell to his knees. A stench started coming out from his crotch. He actually peed himself out of sheer fear of Chu Feng!

“Young hero Chu Feng, please spare us! W-we can speak on your behalf if you wish to reconcile with the Holy Light Clan! We’ll persuade the clan chief for you!”

Shengguang Yunyue also quickly fell to her knees. She wisely chose not to come up with an excuse but to instead beg for mercy while highlighting what they could do for him.

“Reconcile? It was just a passing remark. You actually took my words for real?” Chu Feng scoffed.

“Y-you aren’t intending to reconcile with the Holy Light Clan? What are you planning to do then? Aren’t we heading to the Holy Light Clan right now?” Shengguang Yunyue asked.

“That’s not a problem for you to worry about. I must say, the two of you are far more despicable than I could have imagined. You actually want to harm those around me too?”

Chu Feng rose to his feet as he gazed at the two of them with wintry eyes.

Dragons had a reverse scale that would invoke their wrath once touched, and Chu Feng’s reverse scale was those whom he cared about.

“Young hero Chu feng, spare me! I’m begging you, I don’t want to die!” Shengguang Haifu cried desperately.

Despite his tough front in the Holy Light Clan’s forbidden land the other day, he actually feared death far more than Shengguang Yunyue.

“Don’t worry, I have no intention of taking your lives yet. Whether you can turn the tables and exact vengeance on me will depend on whether your clan chief is really as capable as you make him out to be. But before then...”

With a cold sneer, Chu Feng removed Shengguang Yunyue and Shengguang Haifu’s clothes with a wave of his hands, leaving the two of them stark naked.

Following that, he quickly formed a series of hand seals and sent two formations toward Shengguang Haifu and Shengguang Yunyue respectively. Under the effects of the formations, the two of them lost control of their bodies. Their bodies automatically walked closer and embraced one another before proceeding to do the unspeakable.

“Chu Feng, what are you doing? Stop it right now! Stop it right now!!!”

Shengguang Yunyue’s face turned incredibly red as she began bellowing at Chu Feng furiously.

“Young hero Chu Feng, you can’t do this! You can’t do this to me! Stop! I’ll do whatever you ask me to! Please, I’m begging you...” Shengguang Haifu also screamed in horror too.

“Hah, the two of you have stood tall before others through your entire lifetime. Let’s see how you can keep your heads up high after committing the unspeakable.”

With a cold sneer, Chu Feng walked out of the formation.
