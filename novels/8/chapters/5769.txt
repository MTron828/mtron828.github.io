Chapter 5769: Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline Lowers Its Head

Huangfu Shengyu, with his Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, could induce a phenomenon, and his nine lightning beasts were ten thousand meters tall.

This was already a formidable feat, as the lightning beasts manifested by Huangfu Jiangyao were only thousands of meters in height. In fact, Huangfu Fanni’s lightning beast would only be around a hundred meters in height. They wouldn’t have a chance of inducing a phenomenon at all.

This had nothing to do with their cultivation—it was simply the strength of their bloodline power. This was similar to how a cat, no matter how powerful, could never defeat a tiger.

However, the bloodline power Chu Feng had unleashed surpassed their wildest imagination.

Huangfu Shengyu already possessed the Saint-tier Heavenly Lightning Bloodline. Wouldn’t this mean that Chu Feng’s bloodline was even stronger than that?

“Damn it!” An indignant bellow echoed from the dueling ring. It was from Huangfu Shengyu.

Huangfu Shengyu was not just kneeling; he was practically lying flat on the floor. He tried to prop himself up with his hands, but his trembling limbs simply wouldn’t support him up. Even raising his head was a feat too difficult for him.

The nine lightning beasts he had manifested also shrunk to only a thousand meters in height. They trembled on the spot, their earlier domineering aura faded to extreme fear.

However, Chu Feng’s nine lightning beasts hadn’t done anything. They didn’t specifically direct their might against Huangfu Shengyu or anyone else. All Chu Feng had done was to unleash their true forms, and they merely dominated the sky because of how huge they were.

Yet, Huangfu Shengyu and the others were terrified.

It was simply their natural instincts at work. A ferocious dog would naturally tremble in the face of a tiger, even if the tiger harbored no malevolent intent.

“If Huangfu Shengyu wasn’t lying about there being tiers to the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, it would mean that Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline is even above that of Saint-tier. Just what kind of existence are you, Chu Feng?” Xianhai Shaoyu looked at Chu Feng. “Little sister, you really have a good eye for people.”

“What is it?” Little Fishy asked in confusion. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Your eye for people is amazing. You knew that Brother Chu Feng was an amazing person from the very start,” Xianhai Shaoyu said.

“You’re mad.”

Little Fishy glared at her brother. Her feelings for Chu Feng had nothing to do with the latter’s strength.

“My gosh! Is Brother Chu Feng trying to drive me mad? I already know that he is formidable, but why does he keep shattering my common sense time and time again?” Long Chengyu babbled in disbelief, though no one thought that his reaction was exaggerated.

Even outsiders who didn’t know Chu Feng well saw him in a different light. They felt earnest respect and fear for him, as they could feel the pressure from Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Bloodline too. They were forced to admit that they weren’t on the same level as Chu Feng.

It was said that the Nine Heavens’ Zenith was a place for the prodigies to fight it out and determine the strongest among them, but this looked more like Chu Feng’s solo performance now.

“Gah!” Huangfu Shengyu suddenly cried in agony.

The crowd quickly turned their attention over. Huangfu Shengyu appeared to be undergoing tremendous pain. His nine lightning beasts had shrunk to less than a thousand meters tall now, and they were on the verge of dissipating.

“Young master!”

Huangfu Jiangyao and the others tried to rush forward to save Huangfu Shengyu, but they couldn’t rise to their feet no matter how they struggled. The closer they got to the stone platform, the greater the pressure they felt.

“Brother Chu Feng’s bloodline is expanding. What we see isn’t its true form yet,” Xianhai Shaoyu remarked.

“Indeed, the nine lightning beasts in the sky have gotten even larger,” Long Chengyu agreed.

Even though the nine lightning beasts had already covered the sky earlier, they continued to grow larger to the point that two of them weren’t visible anymore. They were so big that it was impossible to see all of them in their entirety anymore.

Kacha!

Kacha!

The stone platform cracked.

“Brother Chu Feng hasn’t reached his limit yet, but that treasure is already reaching its limit.” Xianhai Shaoyu noticed the changes in the formation and knew that this was about to end.

Boom!

With a loud rumble, the formation disintegrated.

Chu Feng’s nine lightning beasts dissipated, and the terrifying pressure the crowd was put under dissipated as well.

However, Huangfu Shengyu remained sprawled on the ground. Both his body and spirit felt withered after having to face the brunt of the pressure earlier.

“Young master.”

Huangfu Jiangyao and the others quickly rushed forward to support Huangfu Shengyu.

Chu Feng didn’t want to make things harder for Huangfu Shengyu, so he turned around to take his leave.

“Chu Feng, what despicable means did you resort to?” Huangfu Jiangyao suddenly roared at Chu Feng.

“Despicable means? The one who resorted to despicable means is your young master. He had me step onto the formation before telling me that it was a dueling ring to pit our bloodlines against each other. He wanted to suppress me with his so-called Saint-tier Heavenly Bloodline, but he was outdone and got humiliated instead,” Chu Feng sneered.

“Nonsense! My young master possesses the Saint-tier Heavenly Bloodline. This has been tested and proven. There’s no way you could possess the Saint-tier Heavenly Bloodline too!” Huang Jiangyao exclaimed.

“How shameless! Your young masters’ nine lizards can’t even match the size of a single fingernail of Chu Feng’s lightning beasts. I don’t know whether your young master is Saint-tier or not, but he’s clearly nothing but a peasant before our Chu Feng!” Xian Miaomiao scoffed.

“Little sister Miaomiao, how can you say that they’re peasants? You’re giving peasants a bad name here. Their young master’s bloodline is nothing more than a fart before Chu Feng. Didn’t you see how his nine lightning beasts were scared into dissipation in the face of Chu Feng’s lightning beasts?” Feng Ling said.

“Yes, big sister Feng Ling is right,” Xian Miaomiao said.

“Of course,” Feng Ling replied gleefully.

“You all…”

The Huangfus turned livid, but they couldn’t argue against those words.
