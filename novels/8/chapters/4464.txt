Chapter 4464: I Don’t Want To Miss It

“The treasure that sealed off the mountain range isn’t too powerful. I am able to break it easily. Shall we try to barge in forcefully?”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster sent a discreet voice transmission to the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, the Supreme Elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, and the others.

One thing that was worthy of mention was that there was also someone amongst the juniors that had received his message, and that person was no other than Chu Feng.

“You’re right to say that the treasure that has sealed off this place isn’t too strong, but breaking it directly will alarm them.

“Young friend Chu Feng, is there a way for you to use your world spiritist technique to discreetly create an opening for us to sneak in?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked Chu Feng.

“Elders, I have taken a close look at the barrier, and the treasure that has been used isn’t something that can be tampered with using spirit power. The treasure already has a master.

“Given so, there are only two ways we can overcome it. One is to get the master to retract the treasure, and the other is to forcefully smash it open. However, you should take a look there first.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he pointed at a certain part of the barrier.

Upon seeing what was in the direction pointed out by Chu Feng, everyone’s heart skipped a beat. There were four small characters inscribed on the barrier at the place where Chu Feng had pointed out.

Those words looked small and insignificant compared to the massive barrier, and it was far away from the crowd at that. As such, no one really noticed it until Chu Feng pointed it out to them.

Nevertheless, there was no one who could hide their shock upon seeing it, and that was because those four words were ‘Nine Souls Sacred Clan’!

Who was the Nine Souls Sacred Clan?

They were the overlords of the Nine Souls Galaxy!

In terms of prowess, they were far stronger than the Holy Light Clan.

“Could it be that the ones who have dominated this land are from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan?”

After seeing those words, even the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster had no choice but to drop the thought of forcefully breaking the barrier.

He might be quick to resort to violence, but he was no reckless fool. Even he wouldn’t offend someone who was far stronger than him!

“Since there are so many people gathered ahead of us, I reckon that they probably know a thing or two about what’s going on here. Shall we ask around first? The situation might not be as disastrous as we think it out to be,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

His suggestion won the approval of the crowd.

Given that they were unsure of the forces they were exactly up against, it would be wiser for them to scout for intelligence first.

So, the crowd began to ask the onlookers around for information, and soon, the tense atmosphere around them lightened up significantly.

The good news they acquired was that the ones who were dominating this plot of land at the moment weren’t here because of the hidden place. Rather, they found a spirit beast hiding in the area, so they sealed this area to prevent the spirit beast from escaping.

However, there was a piece of bad news too. The one dominating this plot of land was not from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but that person seemed to be deeply favored by a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.

According to the rumors they heard from the onlookers, there was an influential person who offended this person, and his clan ended up getting obliterated. It was definitely not a good idea to mess around with a person who had the Nine Souls Sacred Clan backing him.

However, the real reason why there were so many people gathered in this area was because there were rumors that that princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan would be coming by this area very soon.

“Actually, this works to our advantage. Since they aren’t here for the secret place but a spirit beast, I reckon that they would leave this area once they are done. We just have to wait for a while,” an elder from the Yu Heavenly Clan said.

However, those words swiftly provoked criticism from the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, “You fool. How did someone of your wits manage to become an elder? The fact that they had to go to the extent of sealing up this entire area only goes to show that the spirit beast is not an easy foe to deal with. There’s a chance that they might overturn the entire mountain range while hunting the spirit beast down and discover the hidden place. Perhaps, it might have even already been exposed by now.”

“Ahh...”

Hearing those words, the crowd widened their eyes in realization as their faces turned even graver.

What the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster said was very reasonable too.

“I don’t see any top-notch experts amongst the crowd inside the barrier. Since we have already disguised ourselves, why don’t we barge in and quickly get the job done with?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster proposed.

“It isn’t safe to do so. While the map indicates that the hidden place is located amidst the mountain range, it doesn’t pinpoint the exact location. It’s not uncertain how long it’ll take for us to find it, and if those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan arrive while we’re in the midst of searching, we’ll be in an unfavorable position.

“Besides, we can’t be certain that there aren’t powerful experts hidden in the area. I suggest that we bide our time and wait a little longer first. It isn’t a wise decision to go against those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief opposed the decision of the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster.

His words also won the agreement of many present. Most people in the group felt that it would be better to play it safe.

“Seems like we’ll be leaving it to fate then,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief remarked with a helpless tone.

“Elders, please wait here for me,” Chu Feng suddenly spoke up at this moment.

After saying those words, he began walking toward the mountain range.

“Chu Feng, what are you going to do?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief immediately stopped him.

“I don’t intend to wait it out to the end. I wish to give it a try,” Chu Feng said.

“How are you going to give it a try? Isn’t it impossible to bypass the barrier using world spiritist technique? On top of that, there are people guarding the entrance of the barrier too,” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“It’s quite simple, actually. Aren’t they trying to find a spirit beast? As a world spiritist, I believe that I should be able to offer some help to them,” Chu Feng said.

“But young friend Chu Feng, it’s too dangerous for you to enter that place alone! Besides, the news regarding the hidden place is just mainly one-sided information I heard during the auction. I haven’t been able to verify the authenticity of the news yet. It’s not worth it for you to put yourself at such great risk over something so uncertain,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief opposed the decision.

The other experts present also tried to stop Chu Feng too. They weren’t willing to have Chu Feng take the risk.

However, Chu Feng smiled at them and said, “Elders, please rest assured. I’ll take care of myself.”

Afterward, Chu Feng began making his way toward the mountain range. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

What the others told him was reasonable. It was common for cultivators to risk their lives for treasures, but the risk and reward had to be proportionate for it to be worth it. It was indeed unwise for him to put himself at risk over something that might not even exist.

However, Chu Feng was thinking of something very different at the moment.

This was the first time he was coming into contact with something regarding his grandfather in his entire life, and he had no intention of passing it by.
