Chapter 3872 - Curse Instead Of Acknowledgement

At the moment when the Mystic Cave Saints had begun to flee, Chu Feng suddenly shouted, “Don’t go! Quickly, come back!”

“Brother Asura, why aren’t you fleeing? Are you trying to die?”

The Mystic Cave Saints did not listen to Chu Feng. Instead, they turned their heads towards him and urged him leave as they ran towards the depths of the long corridor.

“Quickly, come back. That aura is fake. If you all do not return now, you’ll miss the opportunity, and might not be able to enter the palace hall." said Chu Feng.

“Really?”

The Mystic Cave Saints stopped in their tracks upon hearing those words. Although they had stopped fleeing, they did not immediately rush back into the palace hall. They appeared very hesitant.

Their reactions were understandable. After all, the auras coming from the coffins was simply too terrifying.

Regardless of what might be in them, they were definitely not things that they could defeat.

If they were to stay, they would be gambling with their lives.

“You all are truly...”

Chu Feng felt helpless. Thus, he no longer bothered with superfluous words, and instead raised his arm.

“Huuu~~~”

Following Chu Feng’s motion, a stream of martial power soared into the sky.

That martial power split in two, and turned into two weapons that flew towards the two coffins.

“Brother Asura, have you gone mad?!!!”

The Mystic Cave Saints were nearly scared to death upon seeing what Chu Feng did.

Those coffins contained terrifying existences.

Yet, Chu Feng had actually attacked them?

He was simply courting death!

However, after the martial power weapons pierced into the coffins, the coffins actually did not reveal any sort of change.

The coffins were still emitting strange howls and auras so powerful that they could devastate everything.

As everything remained the same, it actually signified that Chu Feng’s attack on the coffins did had not caused any change.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Seeing this scene, the Mystic Cave Saints immediately turned around and ran back into the palace hall.

They felt that Chu Feng might’ve gambled correctly, and the terrifying aura and scene was nothing more than a test.

It was a test of their courage, a test to determine if they were qualified to be acknowledged. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Otherwise, it would be impossible for there to be no reaction whatsoever after Chu Feng attacked the coffins.

“Buzz~~~”

At practically the same moment when the Mystic Cave Saints returned to the palace hall, the long corridor started to crumble. At the same time, a devastatingly powerful aura began to wreak havoc in the collapsing corridor.

It was that power that was destroying the long corridor.

That power was simply too terrifying. Not to mention a structure like the long corridor, simply no one would be able to withstand that terrifying power.

Seeing this scene, the Mystic Cave Saints felt a chill run down their spines.

When they looked back at Chu Feng, gratefulness filled their eyes.

Had it not been for him calling out to them and braving danger to show them that it was safe by attacking the coffins of his own accord, they might really have continued with their escape.

Had they done that, they would not only have been unable to gain the acknowledgement of the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor, but they would also have lost their lives in the long corridor.

The appearance of the current long corridor had illustrated everything.

It could be said that Chu Feng had saved their lives.

“Brother Asura, we truly can’t thank you enough.”

The Mystic Cave Saints clasped their fists and bowed to Chu Feng gratefully. They seemed like they were about to kneel down to him.

“Enough, enough. This is nothing major, there is no need for you all to act like this.”

“If you all truly want to thank me, why don’t you give me a couple of your hidden treasures?” said Chu Feng.

“Eh...”

“This...”

“I think what brother Asura said is correct. Although you’ve saved us and we can’t thank you enough for it, but since we are people in the same boat, there is no need for us to be so courteous with each other.” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.

“Mn, what big brother said is correct.”

“Since that’s the case, brother Asura, we won’t be overly courteous with you anymore.”

The Mystic Cave Saints all stopped bowing to Chu Feng.

“The fuck, you bunch of misers.”

Chu Feng took a glance of contempt at the Mystic Cave Saints.

Those Mystic Cave Saints had truly illustrated with perfection what it meant by ‘to regard one’s wealth as highly as one’s life.’

They were expressing their thanks to him nonstop and were about to weep bitter tears.

However, the moment Chu Feng told them to thank him with some treasures, that bunch immediately changed their attitude.

“Buzz~~~”

Suddenly, the terrifying aura started to weaken. Soon, it completely disappeared.

The palace hall had completely returned to normal.

“Fuck! Sure enough, it was to scare us!”

“This Great Monster Slayer Emperor is truly villainous!”

“He first lured us into the residence of the Ancient Era’s organisms. And now, he put forth a bluff to terrify us so that we would run into the fatal long corridor, nearly losing our lives in the process.”

“Fortunately we have brother Asura with us here. Otherwise, we’d have been played to death by him.”

After cursing out the Great Monster Slayer Emperor, the Mystic Cave Saints turned to ask Chu Feng, “Brother Asura, how did you determine that everything earlier was nothing more than a bluff?”

No matter what, they were powerful world spiritists. Yet, they had not noticed that the imposing aura from before was fake. Because of that, they were very curious as to how Chu Feng discovered it.

“I was also uncertain. I merely decided to gamble.”

“Fortunately, my luck is pretty good, and I made the right gamble." said Chu Feng.

“What? Gamble? Fuck! You were gambling with all our lives!”

The Mystic Cave Saints felt extremely astonished. Unfortunately, their faces were covered. Otherwise, one would be able to see how distorted their expressions were.

That said, there was actually some basis behind Chu Feng’s gamble.

It was the experience he had obtained from entering remnants.

His experience told him that the terrifying aura was nothing more than a bluff.

Of course, Chu Feng did not expect the long corridor to possess such devastating power.

Thus, even Chu Feng felt some lingering fear upon thinking about it.

The thought of fleeing had also crossed Chu Feng’s mind earlier.

If he had decided to flee, he would’ve most likely died in the long corridor together with the Mystic Cave Saints.

Fortunately, he had made the right gamble.

“Wuuu~~~”

Suddenly, Chu Feng felt a sharp burning pain emerging from his body.

That burning pain was so intolerable that he soon fell to one knee. Even his consciousness had become somewhat fuzzy.

“Brother Asura, what’s wrong?”

The Mystic Cave Saints were greatly alarmed. They immediately rushed over to Chu Feng.

However, the moment they approached him, they all grew powerless, fell to the ground, and began to scream in pain.

Compared to them, Chu Feng had a higher level of endurance.

After all, Chu Feng was able to tolerate the pain, whereas the Mystic Cave Saints were rolling on the ground and screaming miserably like a bunch of pigs being slaughtered.

Those Mystic Cave Saints simply did not resemble people of the older generation that had cultivated for many years. Instead, they were reacting like a bunch of kids; they simply didn’t have the slightest endurance.

Compared to them, Chu Feng was simply unyielding.

However, that was not the important aspect. What was important was that... Chu Feng was able to see fiery red imprints appearing from the bodies of the Mystic Cave Saints.

Those imprints were being emitted from their bodies, and could be seen even though they were wearing gowns that blocked their appearances. Not even their gown’s effect could stop the light of the imprints.

As for the imprints, they were something that Chu Feng recognized. Those were the talismans they had obtained from breaching the spirit formation of the palace hall.

Chu Feng hurriedly looked at his own body, and discovered that he too was emitting those imprints, penetrating his clothes and making it so that even others could see them clearly.

The intense and unbearable burning pain that covered his entire body was caused by those imprints.

“Crap! Those talismans, they’re not a sign of acknowledgement, but a curse instead???”

Chu Feng’s expression sank. He realized that the situation was extremely bad.
