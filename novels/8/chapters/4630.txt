Chapter 4630: The Trapped Old Man

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, a spirit formation gate was floating in midair.

This spirit formation gate carried the aura of the palace itself, but it looked extremely dissonant from the surroundings, which hinted that it wasn’t naturally formed here.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Three silhouettes fell out of the spirit formation gate and to the ground.

They were no other than Chu Feng, Xiao Yu, and Xia Yan.

As soon as Chu Feng got out, he flung his sleeve and dispelled the spirit formation gate before finally heaving a deep sigh of relief.

“Looks like we managed to escape from the crisis.”

Right after saying those words, he suddenly fell right over onto the ground.

Alarmed, Xia Yan and Xiao Yu quickly rushed forward to help Chu Feng up. It was then that they noticed that Chu Feng was in an incredibly weakened state, and he had even lost consciousness.

“He overexerted himself,” Xiao Yu said.

“Of course he did. He has already depleted himself trying to obtain the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl, but he still pushed himself to fend off Gongsun Yuntian while constructing a formation to escape too. It’s already unbelievable that he managed to pull it off in the end,” Xia Yan said.

At this point, it had already dawned on them that the formation which Chu Feng had constructed to deal with Gongsun Yuntian was nothing more than a feint. In truth, he knew that he didn’t have enough spirit power to fight on, so he had no intention of dragging things out.

He was simply buying time in order to construct a spirit formation gate so that he could escape from the scene.

From the moment he realized that Gongsun Yuntian was in possession of the Summoned Jadehearts, his plan had been to escape.

“Wait a moment. He has already depleted his spirit power prior to fighting against Gongsun Yuntian? Are you certain?” Xiao Yu asked Xia Yan with a look of disbelief.

“Yeah. This fellow created seven clones and simultaneously breached the 9 layers of formation protecting the Purplehaze Ghost King Pearl. Just imagine how much spirit power he must have used up there!” Xia Yan replied.

“But the spirit formation gate he created earlier takes a huge amount of spirit power to create too! Even if he could tap into the power of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace for it, he must have still taken a huge toll from it. This won’t do! We need to find a way to help him... or else he might just lose his life here!” Xiao Yu exclaimed.

She quickly began setting up a formation, taking out many pills as well as one-time-use consumable treasures.

Realization struck Xia Yan as well, and she also hurriedly grabbed Chu Feng’s pulse to check on his condition.

“This fellow is really...”

Upon taking a look, her face immediately paled in horror. Just like Xiao Yu, she quickly took out all of the recovery pills and all sorts of healing consumables she had in her Cosmos Sack

The two of them worked together with one another to construct a formation to heal Chu Feng, not daring to hesitate in the least.

It was no exaggeration to say that Chu Feng was in a horrible state at the moment. Just like what Xiao Yu said, if they were to delay it any longer, Chu Feng could very well lose his life.

...

At this very moment, Chu Feng was oblivious to what was happening outside. He appeared to be unconscious, but in truth, his consciousness had just entered another dimension.

It was a rather messy dimension. There were specks of light glowing here and there, as well as a golden fog lingering in the area. Other than the stone pavement floating in midair under his feet, he could hardly make out anything at all.

Chu Feng was perplexed, but there was little choice for him than to head down the stone pavement.

He walked on and on, and soon, he arrived at the end of the pavement. There was an old man standing in front of him.

The old man was emanating a brilliant radiance, making it impossible to see his face. Chu Feng could only vaguely make out his long hair and beard, which extended for dozens of meters. They floated lightly in midair like a silk cloth, as if they were his limbs.

Chu Feng could sense that the old man before him was extremely powerful. He commanded an unworldly disposition that made him seem like an immortal descending upon the mortal world.

Yet, he had shackles all over his body.

The shackles tying the old man down weren’t too thick, but there were a huge number of them. In fact, there were a few that even pierced through his body. These shackles were linked to a faraway place where Chu Feng couldn’t even see.

Shoosh!

As if having sensed Chu Feng’s arrival, the old man suddenly moved. Along with his movement, the shackles binding him also clanged.

“After waiting for so long, there’s finally a qualified junior.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The old man spoke with a kind but powerful voice as he assessed Chu Feng carefully.

“Junior Chu Feng pays respect to elder.”

Chu Feng realized that he wasn’t in an ordinary dream. Most likely, this was a projection of reality, so he hurriedly bowed deeply to the elder as a sign of respect.

“I know your name. Chu Feng, you’re currently in danger, but I might be able to save you.” The old man told Chu Feng.

“Elder, is there anything you need me to do?” Chu Feng asked.

“You’re a smart man. Since that’s the case, I shan’t beat around the bush with you. I’ve trapped here for many years, biding my time patiently for someone to help me out. However, breaking this cage known as the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace is no easy task.

“I can sense a noble bloodline flowing within your body. You do have the potential to save me, but your current capabilities show that you have yet to fulfil your potential yet. However, if you’re willing to help me, I can help you from your quandary,” the old man said.

“Elder, I am willing to help you, but how do I go about doing it?” Chu Feng asked.

“Your intention is all that matters.”

The old man nodded his head before lifting his hand toward Chu Feng. At the next moment, a surge of light suddenly pierced right into Chu Feng’s body.

Boom!

Golden flames began blazing on Chu Feng’s body.

This phenomenon wasn’t just occurring in this dreamlike world. Back in the real world, Chu Feng’s body had been set alight with golden flames too.

These golden flames were incredibly ferocious, burning through the formation set up by Xiao Yu and Xia Yan in an instant. If not for them retreating right away, they might have been hurt by it too.

“What’s going on?”

Looking at the terrifying golden flames, both Xiao Yu and Xia Yan were horrified.
