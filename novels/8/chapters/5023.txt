Chapter 5023: He Is Your Son, Right?

The Netherworld Envoy fell silent, but his breathing hastened. It was apparent just how shocked he was by the news from his rapid breathing.

“Why would such figures suddenly appear in the Eastern Region? Hasn’t the Eastern Region already fallen into decline?” the Netherworld Envoy asked.

His question sounded like a shocked exclamation rather than one posed to the Netherworld General. He thought that it was unreasonable for experts of such caliber to appear in the Eastern Region.

“Don’t look down on the Eastern Region. Be it in the Ancient Era or the start of the current era, the Eastern Region was the strongest in the entire world of cultivation. It might have fallen into decline since then, but there are many opportunities lying in wait here. Numerous monstrously talented individuals have risen from the Eastern Region too.

“I wouldn’t be too surprised if there are exceptionally powerful experts lurking in the Eastern Region,” the Netherworld General said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Milord, based on what I got from the man with an ax, he seems to be from the Nine Souls Galaxy. Is the man with an ape from the Nine Souls Galaxy too?” the Netherworld Envoy asked.

“That’s hard to say. Based on what I’ve heard, that wasn’t the first time our Netherworld Sect encountered the man with an ape,” the Netherworld General replied.

“We have a history with the man with an ape?” the Netherworld Envoy asked in astonishment.

“I heard bits and pieces from the other elders, but I’m not sure if he’s the same person. However, if he really is, it would mean that he’s terrifyingly strong. That’s also the reason why our Netherworld Sect chose not to pursue the matter at the ancient remnant. Otherwise, our Netherworld Sect might have to pay a hefty price for that,” the Netherworld General replied.

That explained why the Netherworld Sect didn’t go after the man with an ape despite having an important ancient remnant stolen from them, just that the reason sounded even more shocking to the Netherworld Envoy.

He knew just how powerful the Netherworld Sect was. There were only so few people who could intimidate the Netherworld Sect in the vast world of cultivation.

“Milord, what about the matter concerning the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?” the Netherworld Envoy asked.

He came here in hopes that the Netherworld General would step in on his behalf to deal with the middle-aged man from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.

“If Chu Feng is a member of our Netherworld Sect, we won’t let this matter go easily. However, he isn’t a member of our sect yet, so we aren’t obliged to help him.

“Don’t worry, since that man with an axe has stepped in to demand that you release Chu Feng, it likely means that he has been keeping an eye on Chu Feng from the shadows. He’ll step in if Chu Feng really finds himself in a desperate position,” the Netherworld General said.

“But…”

The Netherworld Envoy was put in a spot.

“But what? Did you promise Chu Feng that you would help him?” the Netherworld General asked.

“Milord, I have indeed given out such a promise,” the Netherworld Envoy admitted.

“Haaa…”

The Netherworld General shook his head. He walked over to the Netherworld Envoy’s side and patted the latter’s shoulders.

“Never forget that you’re a Netherworld Envoy of our Netherworld Sect. You have to constantly remind yourself of the mission you have chosen to take on. Don’t let secular desires get in your way,” the Netherworld General said.

“Milord, I understand,” the Netherworld Envoy replied.

“Bring that lass back to the Netherworld Sect. You’ll be rewarded for your merit.”

The Netherworld General passed Song Yun back to the Netherworld Envoy.

“Thank you, milord.”

The Netherworld Envoy took Song Yun back and bowed deeply out of gratitude. He knew that the Netherworld General could have snatched his credit, but the latter didn’t do so.

Not everyone in the Netherworld Sect was as noble as this Netherworld General.

…

Meanwhile, Chu Feng was still waiting for the Netherworld Envoy by the lake.

Out of curiosity, he tried to examine the lake, but there was something unusual about the lake that disallowed him from peering through it even with his Heaven’s Eye. As a result, he was unaware of the conversation that occurred at the bottom of the lake.

Fortunately, it didn’t take long for the Netherworld Envoy to emerge from the lake.

“My apologies, Chu Feng. Our Netherworld Sect has no intention of meddling in this matter,” the Netherworld Envoy gave a direct reply to Chu Feng.

“Elder, there’s no need for you to apologize to me. I’m grateful that you were willing to help me in the first place.”

The outcome was different from what Chu Feng had been promised, but he didn’t blame the Netherworld Envoy for it. It was not as if the Netherworld Envoy owed him anything, so he had every right to choose not to help him.

It would have been childish and entitled of Chu Feng to expect the Netherworld Envoy to unconditionally help him.

“You’re a person of great luck. I believe that you’ll be able to overcome this crisis even without the aid of our Netherworld Sect,” the Netherworld Envoy said.

Just as the Netherworld General had said, if Chu Feng had the man with an axe backing him, it was unlikely that any danger would befall him. Thus, he believed that Chu Feng should be able to resolve his current problems without a hitch.

After all, the man with an axe was even stronger than the Netherworld General. The like of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect wasn’t a threat at all.

In fact, he thought that there was a chance that the man was spying on Chu Feng at this very moment.

…

Little did the Netherworld Envoy know that the man with the axe didn’t follow Chu Feng.

He was currently inside an underground palace located deep inside an Ordinary Realm of the Nine Souls Galaxy. The palace was small but extremely old.

He was together with the little boy.

The little boy sat in the middle of the palace, and a powerful formation was currently operating with him at the center.

Chu Feng would have been shocked to see this formation, for he would have known how formidable it was as a world spiritist himself. It felt as if all energies in the world would be completely devoured by the formation.

Soon enough, a green aura started emerging from the formation. It was identical to the one inside the gourd that Sima Xiangtu had shown Lord Taibai of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. It was just that the green aura puffing from the formation was in a much greater quantity.

As the green aura accumulated, the underground palace started to tremble intensely.

Bam!

A dull thud suddenly echoed.

The middle-aged man had simply stomped his leg lightly, and the trembling came to a halt. At the same time, the green aura started seeping into the boy’s body.

It appeared that the boy was cultivating using the green aura.

Meanwhile, the middle-aged man took down the wood axe from his back and slowly traced his finger through it before abruptly stopping on a crack. It was a small one, but it made this axe imperfect.

As he touched the small crack, his eyes slowly turned contemplative. Complex emotions surfaced on his calm face.

“Chu Feng is your son, right?” the middle-aged man mumbled to himself.
