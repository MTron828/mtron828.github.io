Chapter 2345 - An Impossible Thing

“Haha...”

Seeing the green complexioned World Spiritist Saintess baring a furious expression and itching to kill him, Chu Feng smiled complacently. Then, before the crowd, he outlined the diagram of a grand spirit formation.

Once Chu Feng finished outlining the diagram, the expressions of the world spiritists present all changed. They all revealed a disappointed expression.

“Hahaha...”

“And here I was wondering how amazing the spirit formation might be. It turns out to only be such a rudimentary spirit formation,” The World Spiritist Saintess laughed with contempt. It was as if all of the repressed emotions in her heart were finally being released. Showing no quarter, she began to mock Chu Feng.

“Little friend Chu Feng, are you certain that you want us to set up that spirit formation?” At the same time, the other Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists also began to doubt Chu Feng.

“Seniors, this spirit formation needs all of you to set up. You all merely need to set it up according to this diagram I’ve drawn,” Chu Feng did not explain in great detail. However, he had a confident expression the entire time.

“Everyone, a spirit formation like that is simply child’s play. How could it possibly undo Grandmaster Kai Hong’s grand defensive formation?”

“Furthermore, although the spirit formation Chu Feng proposed possesses very weak power, it requires an enormous amount of spirit power. If you all are to assist him in setting up that spirit formation, you will definitely exhaust an enormous amount of spirit power.”

“Could it be that you all are truly willing to exhaust your spirit power for a completely useless spirit formation?” The World Spiritist Saintess began to sow dissension.

“This...” At that moment, the Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists started to hesitate.

“If this spirit formation of mine is unable to undo the grand defensive formation, I, Chu Feng, am willing to have you all handle my life as you wish,” Chu Feng said.

Chu Feng’s words shocked the crowd. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Confident, he was truly confident. He was so confident that he was willing to put his life at stake.

“Ridiculous! Did you think your life to be very valuable? You are but a mere Half Martial Ancestor. There are people at your level of cultivation all over the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Not to mention a single life, even a hundred of your lives would not suffice for these grand world spiritists to exhaust their spirit power,” The World Spiritist Saintess said.

“Regardless of whether or not my life is valuable, I dare to gamble with it. What about you, do you dare to gamble with your life?” Chu Feng asked the World Spiritist Saintess.

“What?” The World Spiritist Saintess was somewhat at a loss.

“I’m saying that I’ll gamble with you. If my spirit formation is unable to open that grand defensive formation, my life shall be yours.”

“However, if my spirit formation is able to undo the grand defensive formation, your life shall be mine.”

“Do you dare to accept my gamble?” Chu Feng asked.

“Ridiculous! Why must I gamble with you?” The World Spiritist Saintess sneered.

“Weren’t you firmly certain that I would be unable to undo that grand defensive formation? If you’re so certain, then why do you not dare to gamble with me?” Chu Feng continued.

“What utter nonsense!” The World Spiritist Saintess had a difficult expression. The reason for that was because she truly did not dare to gamble with Chu Feng.

“If you’re scared, then you’re scared. Stop trying to find an excuse,” Zhao Hong remarked.

“T-that’s right. S-since you are n-not certain that m-my brother is u-unable to undo the s-spirit formation, it m-means that you a-are trying to m-mislead the public w-with lies. You a-are truly despicable,” Wang Qiang insulted.

“Seniors, I, Chu Feng, am actually able to undo the spirit formation myself. If you all do not believe me, and fear that you will end up wasting your spirit power, allow me to do it myself then,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he began to set up his spirit formation.

“This...” At that moment, those world spiritists were at a loss for what to say.

Like the World Spiritist Saintess, they did not believe the spirit formation Chu Feng had told them to set up would be able to undo the grand defensive formation.

After all, the spirit formations they had used earlier, including the one that the World Spiritist Saintess had set up, were several hundred times more brilliant than the spirit formation Chu Feng had proposed.

When even they failed, how could Chu Feng’s spirit formation possibly be able to succeed?

As for the other reason why they did not want to help, it was something that the World Spiritist Saintess had mentioned.

That was, although the spirit formation Chu Feng proposed was very weak, it would consume an enormous amount of spirit power.

Before undoing the grand defensive formation, before obtaining Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance and treasures, no one was willing to exhaust their strength for no reason, much less on a spirit formation that they felt to be destined to fail.

“Chu Feng, I’ll help you,” Zhao Hong walked over and began to help Chu Feng set up his spirit formation.

“M-me too,” Wang Qiang also walked over to assist Chu Feng.

“Those two brats are actually also Immortal-cloak World Spiritists?!”

When Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong unleashed their spirit power, the crowd present were all extremely surprised.

They already knew that Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. However, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were people that they’d never heard of before.

That said, Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were extremely rare. Countless world spiritists trained their entire lives, but never managed to become Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.

Generally, all those that were capable of becoming Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were individuals that had obtained great attainments in world spirit techniques. As such, how could they possibly be people of the younger generation?

Chu Feng, a member of the younger generation, becoming an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist was already something that had shaken the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

Yet now, Chu Feng’s two friends were actually also Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. How could the crowd not be astonished?

At that moment, not to mention the others, even the World Spiritist Saintess, who greatly detested Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, had a change in expression, revealing a serious gaze.

As matters stood, she had no choice but to take Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong seriously.

If a single genius was not something worthy of making her afraid, then three geniuses would be something that she would have to take very seriously.

“It’s useless. Although that spirit formation of yours is extremely weak, it consumes an enormous amount of spirit power. With the cultivation the three of you possess, you simply do not possess sufficient spirit power to finish setting up that spirit formation,” The World Spiritist Saintess declared.

Hearing those words, the crowd began to nod. It was true that the spirit formation consumed an enormous amount of spirit power. Even for the Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists present, they would have to exhaust a great amount of spirit power too. As such, there was no need to mention how Chu Feng and his two friends, three mere brats, would not be able to successfully set up the spirit formation.

“There’s no need for you all to worry,” Zhao Hong said.

“T-that’s right. W-whether or not w-we succeed d-does not concern you all,” Wang Qiang said mockingly.

“Truly a bunch that doesn’t appreciate other’s kind intentions,” At that moment, many people revealed discontent. No matter what, both Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were people of the younger generation. As such, they would naturally be unhappy for the two of them to speak to them in such a manner.

As for Chu Feng, he did not even utter a word. Instead, he was completely focused on setting up that spirit formation.

After an hour passed, all those people that were feeling pessimistic of the outcome had a change in expression.

Logically, to set up that spirit formation, after an hour passed, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong should have exhausted nearly all of their spirit power.

However, at that moment, it would appear that Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang still had an abundant amount of spirit power.

The most important aspect was that it was not only Chu Feng himself, as both Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang also still had an abundant amount of spirit power.

“Genius world spiritists. They are truly genius world spiritists,” Many of the Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists present began to utter praise.

While they were also Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, and possessed cultivations much superior to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, they knew very well that the amount of spirit power that they had was greatly inferior to the amount the Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at that moment, that spirit formation Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were setting up suddenly blossomed with light.

“Success, they actually succeeded,” When Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong successfully set up that spirit formation, the crowd all revealed expressions of disbelief.

The reason for that was because what Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had accomplished was something they had deemed to be impossible.

“Don’t say that I am pouring cold water on you all. Even though you all have set up that spirit formation using all of your strength, it is still useless. After all, that spirit formation will not be able to undo that grand spirit formation,” The World Spiritist Saintess said.

“A pity,” At the same time, other people also began to sigh. Although Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong possessed spirit power much more abundant than ordinary people, the crowd still did not think highly of the spirit formation they’d managed to set up.

“Buzz~~~”

Right at this moment, with Chu Feng controlling the spirit formation, the spirit formation was activated.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

After that spirit formation was activated, many rays of light shot out of it

At that moment, the crowd felt even more certain that the spirit formation would be useless.

The reason for that was because those lights were simply too weak. It would be impossible for them to breach the grand defensive formation. They felt that it was simply akin to striking a stone with an egg.

“This... how could this be?”

However, the very next moment, those world spiritists that felt Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong’s efforts to be useless were all tongue-tied with wide open mouths. They were completely stunned.

The reason for that was because the lights shot out by that spirit formation actually managed to easily penetrate the grand defensive formation.
