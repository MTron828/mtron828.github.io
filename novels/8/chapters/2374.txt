Chapter 2374 - Arrival

“The world of martial cultivators is so enormous that it could simply be said to be boundlessly vast. However, there is one thing that remains unchanged in the entire martial cultivation world. That is, regardless of where one might be, there is no such thing as absolute fairness,” When mentioning this, Ma Yue started to smile wryly. Her wry smile was composed of helplessness and sadness.

Merely from her smile, Chu Feng felt as if he had seen the unfairness that they’d encountered in the Hundred Refinements Stage.

“That fellow by the name of Zhou Zongzhi should be a man, right?” Chu Feng asked.

“Zhou Zongzhi is indeed a man. As a man, he actually did such a despicable thing to a woman. He is truly lower than dogs and pigs!” Tian Yi said while gnashing his teeth furiously.

“Indeed,” Chu Feng nodded. He also started to have a bad impression of that Zhou Zongzhi.

Among the several types of people that Chu Feng detested the most were those who bullied women.

If it was an ordinary confrontation, then it could be forgiven. However, that Zhou Zongzhi actually poisoned a woman, and then ruthlessly beat up said woman. His actions were truly despicable to the extreme.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng was the one who healed Ma Yue’s injuries. Thus, he was able to tell that while the poison was the most life-threatening, the person who had beat her up had been extremely ruthless. It could even be said that whoever beat her up was trying to take her life.

From just that, it could be seen that Zhou Zongzhi was not a good individual.

At that moment, Her Lady Queen placed her hands on her waist. With her mouth protruded, she said in a very furious manner, “Truly despicable and shameless! Chu Feng, even this Queen is unable to tolerate this!”

“Milady Queen, do you have any instructions?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile. He was able to tell that Her Lady Queen had developed a bad impression of Zhou Zongzhi. Unlike Chu Feng, Her Lady Queen was someone who would generally take action should she have a bad impression of someone.

“Chu Feng, if the couple Ma Yue and Tian Yi is unable to defeat Zhou Zongzhi, you should help them take care of that Zhou Zongzhi,” Her Lady Queen said.

“I will as do as you have bid,” Chu Feng agreed frankly.

Actually, even if Her Lady Queen didn’t mention it to him, Chu Feng had that intention too.

“However, in the end, it is because we are too weak. As such, we cannot blame others.”

“If we possessed the strength that senior does, and were able to enter and exit the Hundred Refinements Stage at will, we would not have been bullied,” That Ma Yue looked to Chu Feng as Intense admiration filled her eyes.

“Actually, I have only stealthily infiltrated into here. If I were to contend against the guardian clan, I would be no match,” Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he added, “Furthermore, please don’t address me as senior. It is giving me a weird sensation. After all, I am much younger than you two.”

“What? You... you are younger than us?” Both Ma Yue and Tian Yi were shocked to hear those words.

After a moment of shock, Ma Yue and Tian Yi asked in unison, “Could it be that you’re really only a member of the younger generation?”

Actually, they were able to tell that Chu Feng appeared very young, and could be considered to be a younger person among the younger generation.

It was precisely because Chu Feng was so young yet so powerful that he did not conform with the experiences that they’d had. Thus, they felt that Chu Feng’s age might be fake, that Chu Feng had concealed his actual age, and was actually much older than them.

“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded.

“This!!!”

Ma Yue and Tian Yi were even more astonished after Chu Feng voiced his acknowledgement again. After all, to be able to obtain such accomplishments at Chu Feng’s age was truly something that surpassed their imagination.

When thinking about themselves, they remembered that they were still very small and weak at Chu Feng’s age.

“The Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is truly extraordinary. Back then, we were truly viewing the sky from the bottom of a well.”

“Senior, today, you have truly broadened our horizons,” Tian Yi and Ma Yue said emotionally.

“Actually, I am not from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. I am also from a Lower Realm. Merely, by a freak combination of factors, I was unable to arrive in the Hundred Refinements Stage,” Chu Feng said with a smile. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You’re actually also from a Lower Realm?” At that moment, Tian Yi and Ma Yue were tongue-tied with shock. They were deeply astonished by the truth Chu Feng had just mentioned.

“May I ask which Lower Realm you’re from?”

“You... you couldn’t possibly also be from the Splendor Night Lower Realm, right?”

After a moment of pondering, Ma Yue and Tian Yi started to panic. After all, among the various Lower Realms, the strongest was the Splendor Night Lower Realm.

After arriving in this place, they heard many things about the experts from the Splendor Night Lower Realm.

For Chu Feng to obtain his level of strength at such a young age, they were truly unable to think of any other Lower Realm other than the Splendor Night Lower Realm that was capable of nurturing such a powerful individual.

“If I were from the Splendor Night Lower Realm, how could I not know that Zhou Zongzhi?” Chu Feng smiled wryly and shook his head.

“Right. We were silly. How could you possibly have come from the Splendor Night Lower Realm,” Seeing that Chu Feng declared that he did not come from the Splendor Night Lower Realm, Ma Yue and Tian Yi heaved a sigh of relief. Then, they asked, “Senior, then which Lower Realm might you be from?”

“I can tell the two of you. However, you two must absolutely keep it a secret,” Chu Feng said.

“Senior, please rest assured, we will definitely keep it confidential.”

“If we are to reveal a single word of what senior tells us here today, then we husband and wife shall suffer miserable deaths,” Not only did Ma Yue and Tian Yi agree to keep things confidential, they also vowed to the heavens.

Seeing how sincere the two of them were, Chu Feng no longer bother concealing the matter and said, “The Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.”

“What? It’s actually the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm?!!!” Hearing those words, Ma Yue and Tian Yi’s expressions changed enormously. They were much more astonished than before.

“It seems that you two have heard of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm?” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“We have indeed heard of it. Merely, the viewpoints that the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm have of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm are...”

Ma Yue frowned at Tian Yi and interrupted, “It seems that the viewpoint of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is not true.” Evidently, there were some words that they found unpleasant to say.

“Actually, I know about it even without you two saying it. There has never been anyone from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm who has reached the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for many years. Likely, no one here will think highly of those from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. They likely all feel it to be a gathering place for trash,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

Chu Feng’s father had already mentioned this matter to Chu Feng before.

Merely, it remained that Chu Feng had grown up in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. Thus, the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm possessed a special sort of significance to him. Compared to the vast Outer World, the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm was Chu Feng’s home.

Thus, Chu Feng was actually not fond of others speaking ill of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

If possible, he would want to rectify the reputation of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm as a person of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.

“That’s right. The people here really do look down on the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.”

“However, seeing you today, we now know how powerful the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm is. That is truly worthy of being the place where the Fate Primogenitor was born. Likely, only in a Lower Realm like that would an outstanding hero like senior be born,” Ma Yue said.

“You two also know of the Fate Primogenitor?” Chu Feng was very surprised.

“We have heard of the legends of the Fate Primogenitor back in our Elm Lower Realm. Merely, there were simply too many legends regarding him. Furthermore, all of those legends are different. However, in this place, we’ve found out that everyone believes that the Fate Primogenitor came from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm,” Ma Yue said.

“Senior, as you’re from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, you should know more about the Fate Primogenitor, right?” Tian Yi asked in a very curious manner. When he mentioned the Fate Primogenitor, both his tone and attitude were filled with adoration.

From this, it could be seen that the Fate Primogenitor was very influential.

“The things regarding the Fate Primogenitor are merely legends in our Ancestral Martial Lower Realm too. I feel that it is best that I not make wild remarks.”

“Additionally, the two of you really shouldn’t address me as senior. You can just address me as Chu Feng,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Okay, we’ll do as senior says,” Ma Yue and Tian Yi said respectfully.

At that moment, Chu Feng smiled helplessly.

Chu Fengs’ strength greatly surpassed that of the two of them. Furthermore, as Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he left a grand impression on the two of them.

Even though Chu Feng had already declared that he was not a senior, he was unable to change the extremely respectful attitude that Ma Yue and Tian Yi had toward him.

As such, Chu Feng decided to stop lingering on the issue. Instead, he began to chat with them while continuing to proceed toward the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.

Being guided by the husband and wife duo of Tian Yi and Ma Yue, Chu Feng finally arrived at the location where the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was stored.

Merely, before they approached that place, Ma Yue and Tian Yi stopped.
