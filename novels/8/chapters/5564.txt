Chapter 5564: An Opportunity Knocking On the Door

“Of course not. How could I construct such a formidable formation armor?” Chu Feng refuted the claim right away, knowing that Jie Tian might kill him if he admitted to it.

Jie Tian accepted Chu Feng’s words without any hesitation, saying, “Of course. There’s no way you could construct such a formidable formation armor.”

“That fellow trusts you just like that?” Eggy was taken aback.

“He never truly thought that I was the one who constructed it,” Chu Feng replied.

“Then what’s the point of that question?” Eggy was confused.

“He’s probably trying to confirm something else,” Chu Feng said.

Jie Tian pondered for a moment before he turned to the emaciated elder and said, “It looks like the primal elder doesn’t fully trust me. He says that he’ll offer the best resources to me while secretly constructing a formation armor that allows Xianhai Yu’er to exert her bloodline power.”

He thought that Little Fishy’s formation armor was the primal elder’s work, which made sense since the latter was the person in control of the Star Sea Realm. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The emaciated elder panicked as he thought that Jie Tian’s deduction made sense.

“Could the primal elder have noticed our betrayal? Is that why he constructed such a formidable formation armor for Xianhai Yu’er behind our back?” the emaciated elder asked worriedly.

“What are you afraid of? Lord Saint Exalted is about to descend and dominate the Star Sea Realm. The primal elder isn’t a threat to us at all. The Star Sea Realm is going to be ours very soon,” the other two elders said.

The other two elders weren’t afraid of the primal elder. Their auras were weaker than Jie Tian’s formation armor, but their strength was comparable to the emaciated elder. They were likely to be chief elders in the past, just that they had turned against the Star Sea Realm.

Their fear for the primal elder probably faded when they remained safe despite having turned against the Star Sea Realm.

The emaciated elder calmed down a little after hearing their words.

“It’ll be trickier for us to deal with Xianhai Yu’er now. Lord Jie Tian, why don’t you lure her here? We’ll help you deal with her,” the emaciated elder said.

“You? Do you think you’re stronger than my formation armor?” Jie Tian sneered.

“Erk…”

All three of the elders were rendered speechless.

“I can deal with Xianhai Yu’er. I’ll open that door and accomplish the mission Lord Saint Exalted entrusted to me. What I’m more worried about is whether you have completed your missions,” Jie Tian asked.

“Lord Jie Tian, the formation is already complete. It won’t be long before Lord Saint Exalted sees the light of the day,” the three elders said before heading underground.

They passed through a spirit formation gate and encountered a humongous formation that dominated the entire space. This humongous formation was connected to the sea of energy beneath the Star Sea Realm, siphoning spirit power from it.

The humongous formation contained an ocean of bubbling black water, emanating intense malevolence.

Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eyes and clearly saw a humongous monster spanning over a hundred thousand meters long lurking in the depth of the black water.

This monster resembled a human, but its body was extremely thin and withered as if it was made out of a dying tree. It only had two legs but eighteen arms. Its appearance was so sinister that it induced goosebumps.

The aura of malevolence came not from the black water but the monster, just that the monster didn’t seem to be alive at the moment.

“It’s finally completed.” Jie Tian looked at the humongous formation and the monster inside it before nodding in satisfaction.

Eggy frowned and asked, “Chu Feng, that monster in the formation is the Saint Exalted, as well as the evil power terrorizing the Star Sea Realm? Are they using the formation to revive it?”

She could sense the terrifying power harnessed by the monster even though it wasn’t alive yet. This power far surpassed that of the three chief elders and even Jie Tian and Little Fishy even when they were in their formation armor.

It was unlikely that the primal elder would be stronger than this monster even if he was much stronger than the chief elders.

“Yes, this aura belongs to the evil power, but something is amiss,” Chu Feng said.

“What?” Eggy asked.

“This seems to just be an empty shell. This formation serves to construct the shell, but the true entity of the evil power isn’t inside it. Perhaps the evil power currently exists in a unique form, and it requires this shell in order to truly come to life,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you able to stop it?” Eggy asked.

The evil power was bound to be extremely powerful. Neither Little Fishy nor the primal elder would be a match for it once it came to life. Eggy wasn’t too worried about the other formation entities, but she was worried about Little Fishy.

“This formation is riddled with flaws. It may seem impressive that those three chief elders have harnessed the underground spirit power for this formation, but I don’t think that they truly comprehend the underground sea of energy, or at least, their understanding is beneath mine. I just need a chance to tamper with the formation to mess it up,” Chu Feng said with a frown.

The problem was that Jie Tian and the three chief elders were here. He wouldn’t have a chance to strike at all. There was no way he could tamper with the formation under their watch.

Shoosh!

Just then, Jie Tian took out his eighteen formation armors with a wave of his sleeves. Then, he turned to Chu Feng and pointed at the humongous formation forging the evil power’s shell and instructed, “Activate five of the formation armors and have them enter the formation to undergo tempering.”

“Ah?” Chu Feng was stunned.

“You don’t get it? Look and learn.”

Jie Tian controlled thirteen of the formation armors and had them enter the humongous formation. The evil power inside the humongous formation quickly surged toward the thirteen formation armors to temper them.

Chu Feng could tell that this was the final and the most crucial step to completing the formation armors, just that this step was extremely exhausting. It posed a huge burden even to Jie Tian, which was why he needed Chu Feng’s help for it.

“What are you sitting in a daze for? Hurry up! Do you want to die?” Jie Tian glared at Chu Feng.

“Don’t be afraid, 521. While that formation will place some burden on you, it won’t take your life. Rest assured that I’ll handsomely reward you after you complete your mission. With your talent, there’ll be a seat for you amongst the chief elders in the future,” the emaciated elder said.

“Afraid?” Chu Feng laughed in his head.

If anything, he was overjoyed. He was still struggling to find a way to tamper with the humongous formation when an opportunity was delivered right into his hands.
