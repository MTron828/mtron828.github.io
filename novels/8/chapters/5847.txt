Chapter 5848: You Think There’s No One in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?

Chapter 5848: You Think There’s No One in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?

In the Ancient Era’s formation realm, a huge number of martial cultivators and world spiritists from the six Ancient Era’s clans were standing neatly before the formation core Zhao Gongyi and the others had entered earlier.

These people were organized not based on their clans but their cultivation level—rank one Exalted level cultivators, rank two Exalted level cultivators, and so on. The weaker ones stood in front, whereas the stronger ones were behind.

At the very back of the formation were pinnacle True God level cultivators and pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritists.

All of them had unique runes inscribed on their bodies, and they were holding a bottle in their hands. The rank one Exalted level cultivators tightly clasped their bottles, ready to pop them open. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Rank one Exalted. Take the medicine and enter the formation,” Puppeteer Exalted ordered.

The formation core emanated the aura of a rank one Exalted level cultivator too.

Tens of thousands of rank one Exalted level cultivators popped open their bottles, downed the contents, and the runes inscribed on their bodies glowed. Without any hesitation, they stepped into the formation core.

Through the power of the formation, they circumvented the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation and entered the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

And this was only the beginning.

As the formation strengthened, stronger cultivators and world spiritists would be able to bypass the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation to invade the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

“They are already sending people in?”

Chu Feng sensed someone slipping through their protective formation, but the invaders were only at rank one Exalted level. At that level, they wouldn’t be able to do anything in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Thus, he was intrigued.

“No, they are imbued with formation runes. Could there be another purpose behind this?”

Chu Feng quickly noticed that those who had entered the Ancestral Martial Galaxy didn’t launch their assault right away. Instead, they formed a hand seal which caused their runes to seep into the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation.

Chu Feng tried to analyze those runes, but they were so obscure that he couldn’t figure out their purpose.

He should have opened a spirit formation gate to dispatch Zi Ling or someone else to eliminate those people. Even if they didn’t pose a threat to them, they should be killed to set an example. Unfortunately, he had only come into contact with the formation core not too long ago, such that he hadn’t reached the proficiency required to freely open a spirit formation gate in the protective formation.

He could turn his focus toward that, but it would take some time too, not to mention it would distract him from his efforts to stop the enemy’s spirit formation gate’s cultivation cap from rising any further.

Weng!

Just then, Chu Feng sensed a spirit formation gate appearing before the invaders.

“Did Lord Sectmaster notice them too?” Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief.

The only other person in control of the protective formation was the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, so the spirit formation gate had to be opened by her.

Unlike Chu Feng, who had gained power over the protective formation by deciphering its secrets, she had the formation token, which granted her absolute authority over the formation. She had been focusing her attention on checking whether the protective formation had been breached or not, which was why she was able to swiftly react to the invaders.

Unfortunately, she wasn’t sufficiently skilled to help Chu Feng seal off the enemy’s spirit formation gate’s increasing cultivation cap, so she could only watch helplessly as invaders slipped into the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

...

A person flitted out of the spirit formation gate opened by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster. It was Shengguang Baimei. He had been entrusted with the job of eliminating the invaders.

The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster and the Holy Master agreed with Chu Feng—they couldn’t let the enemy do as they pleased even though they were only at rank one Exalted level.

“Kill him!”

Despite being only rank one Exalted level cultivators, those from the Ancient Era’s clans still drew their weapons and charged at Shengguang Baimei. Even so, their courage was in vain.

Shengguang Baimei easily slaughtered all tens of thousands of them with a single palm strike.

“Mere rank one Exalted level cultivators dare to wreak havoc on our Holy Light Galaxy?” Shengguang Baimei snorted in anger. He thought that the enemy was looking down on them by sending such weaklings in.

Soon, tens of thousands more figures flew in through the black light spirit formation gate. They were from the Ancient Era’s clans too, but this time, they were at rank two Exalted level.

Shengguang Baimei didn’t bother raising his hand. With a mere thought, he crushed all of them into bits with his oppressive might.

“You don’t fear death? Very well, I’ll play with you!” Shengguang Baimei’s aura raged like a demonic god. He stood in front of the black light spirit formation gate, ready to slaughter anyone who passed through it.

However, for a long time afterward, no one else entered the black light spirit formation gate.

It was only six hours later that an old man from the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion finally emerged from the black light spirit formation gate. He was a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist.

As soon as the old man appeared, he unleashed his spirit power and locked Shengguang Baimei in place. He glared at Shengguang Baimei and sneered, “A mere ant dares to kill our Ancient Era’s clansmen?”

The old man’s presence here showed that the black light spirit formation gate’s cultivation cap had risen to the level of pinnacle Half-God level, which meant that other pinnacle Half-God level cultivators could traverse over too.

As expected, more people from the Ancient Era’s clans began flooding in through the black light spirit formation gate like a swarm of locusts.

“Kill me! I don’t fear you!” Shengguang Baimei showed no fear despite knowing his enemy was much stronger than him.

“You won’t die that easily. You have sinned for daring to kill our clansmen. I shall take control of your body and make you slaughter your friends and family with your own hands!” The pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist channeled his spirit power into Shengguang Baimei’s body to control the latter.

“Stop! Stop!” Shengguang Baimei panicked.

He didn’t fear death, but he didn’t want to become the enemy’s puppet.

Just then, an old but powerful voice echoed. “Does the Ancient Era’s clans think that our Ancestral Martial Galaxy has no one?”

There was a flash of martial power, and the pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist was sliced into two and lost his life.

At the same time, a powerful surge of spirit power descended and enveloped the area. All of the Ancient Era’s clansmen who entered the Ancestral Martial Galaxy were caught in it.

“Our intelligence is off. They have experts who are at least at pinnacle Half-God level here!” Those from the Ancient Era’s clans panicked.

They had refrained from sending anyone in after the rank two Exalted level cultivators because they didn’t want to incur needless casualties. So, they waited six hours for the cultivation cap to be raised to pinnacle Half-God level before entering the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

They figured that even if Chu Feng was here, he would have to devote his full attention to channeling the formation core to stop their black light spirit formation gate, so he wouldn’t be able to deal with them.

Under such conditions, they could run rampant in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, and no one would be able to stop them.

However, they didn’t expect the Ancestral Martial Galaxy to have experts other than Chu Feng. This was not good, as their True Gods were still unable to enter yet. At this rate, they would be wiped out.
