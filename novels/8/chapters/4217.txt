Chapter 4217 - Rank One Dragon Transformation Sensation?

“Amazing. Could it be that Chu Feng hadn’t been going all-out earlier?”

Seeing that Chu Feng was actually gaining the upper hand in the match, Yuan Shu grew wild with joy.

Truth be told, after the first match between Chu Feng and Li Fengxue, Yuan Shu did not place much hope in Chu Feng’s victory.

If it wasn’t for his master’s refusal, he would’ve spoken to dissuade Chu Feng from continuing to bring ruin upon himself.

He also did not wish to have Chu Feng throw away the four Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain in vain.

It was precisely because he did not have any expectations for Chu Feng that he was so overjoyed by the current situation. After all, this was simply an unexpectedly pleasant surprise.

“Fengxue, what are you doing?!”

Revered Master Beast Tamer, on the other hand, was panicking.

He had put forth four Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain for the gamble.

Thus, to him, it was a gamble that could only be won, and not lost!

“Damn it!”

Being reprimanded by his master, Li Fengxue frowned even deeper. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Forced into a corner, a look of determination appeared in his eyes.

Then, he made a gulping motion.

“Buzz---”

Once he did that, energy fluctuations burst from his body.

The fluctuations grew more and more intense. Soon, countless dazzling golden runes and symbols began to revolve around his body.

Following that, the runes and symbols also appeared on his spirit formation.

With that, his spirit formation’s power increased enormously.

“Li Fengxue, how could you be so shameless?! You’ve actually swallowed a forbidden medicine?!”

Seeing that, the mild-tempered Yuan Shu was actually unable to contain himself, and cursed at Li Fengxue.

He knew merely from seeing the runes and symbols that had appeared that Li Fengxue had utilized the power of something that was not his own.

Li Fengxue had taken a forbidden medicine.

Spirit formation forbidden medicine was the same as martial power forbidden medicine. It was also capable of strengthening one’s battle power.

The only difference between them was that a martial power forbidden medicine increased one’s martial power, whereas a spirit formation forbidden medicine increased one’s spirit power.

Even though Li Fengxue had not openly swallowed the forbidden medicine, they all knew that he must’ve taken a forbidden medicine by the visual effects and his increased battle power.

For some world spiritists and martial cultivators, they would hide forbidden medicines in their mouths for the sake of the unexpected, so that they could take their forbidden medicines whilst fighting.

Because of that, Yuan Shu felt that Li Fengxue must’ve kept a spirit formation forbidden medicine in his mouth.

Furthermore, from how much his spirit power had increased, Yuan Shu could tell that the forbidden medicine he had taken was a very powerful one too.

“Beast Tamer, that disciple of yours is simply too shameless, no?”

“How could he utilize the power of a forbidden medicine just because his own ability is no match for his opponent’s?”

“Is this the good disciple you’ve nurtured?”

Even Grandmaster Tang Chen was unable to keep himself from making criticisms.

“Tang Chen, you shouldn’t make irresponsible remarks.”

“No one said before the match that the competitors couldn’t use external sources of power to assist themselves.”

“That Chu Feng is also fully capable of using external powers,” said the Revered Master Beast Tamer.

“You...”

Hearing those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen became even more displeased.

However, he didn’t say anything. He didn’t plan to argue with Revered Master Beast Tamer.

Since they were unwilling to follow the rules, he was determined to not follow the rules either.

He made the resolution that even if Chu Feng were to lose the match, he would not allow him to hand the four Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain to the Revered Master Beast Tamer.

He would determine Li Fengxue to have violated the rules of the match and make him win nothing.

Furthermore, he would drive both Revered Master Beast Tamer and his disciple from the palace.

Suddenly, Revered Master Beast Tamer shouted, “Li Fengxue, what are you doing?!”

“Get serious for once!”

His expression had turned even uglier.

Hearing those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen also turned to look at the match between Chu Feng and Li Fengxue.

It was only then that he discovered that Chu Feng was actually dominating Li Fengxue even more than before.

Li Fengxue’s spirit power had clearly been strengthened enormously.

Yet, he was unable to contend against Chu Feng.

Filled with excitement, Grandmaster Tang Chen blurted out, “This power. Could it be that... young friend Chu Feng has grasped rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation?”

“Rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation?”

Yuan Shu was extremely shocked to hear those words.

As for Revered Master Beast Tamer, his complexion turned gloomy.

He could tell that Chu Feng’s spirit power had reached the level of rank three Utmost Exalted.

Ordinary Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists with rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation would only possess spirit power on par with rank two Utmost Exalteds.

Chu Feng’s spirit power had surpassed the level of rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.

‘That brat was actually concealing his strength?’

‘Motherfucker! I’ve been duped!’

Revered Master Beast Tamer cried out in his heart.

He suddenly understood everything.

Chu Feng had done all of it on purpose.

Chu Feng was deliberately allowing his disciple to win.

His intention had been to lure him into agreeing to another match.

As for the second match, they would use four Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain as the gambling stake.

But, for the second match, there was simply no way for them to win.

“Damn it!”

Reacting to what was happening, Revered Master Beast Tamer gnashed his teeth so furiously that it could be heard from far away.

“Master, save me!”

Li Fengxue suddenly shouted for help.

Chu Feng’s spirit power had reached him.

Even though Li Fengxue was an Utmost Exalted-level expert, he was only a rank two Utmost Exalted.

His cultivation was even weaker than Yuan Shu’s.

As such, how could he possibly withstand spirit power that was on par with an attack from a rank three Utmost Exalted?

“Useless trash, you might as well die!”

Revered Master Beast Tamer had a furious look on his face. He had no intention of saving his disciple.

“Young friend Chu Feng, this is merely a spar. You should stop when the outcome is determined.”

Grandmaster Tang Chen actually spoke to stop Chu Feng.

“My opponent still hasn’t conceded,” as Chu Feng said those words, his spirit power grew even stronger.

“I concede! I concede!”

Seeing that things were bad, Li Fengxue spoke to concede repeatedly.

He felt that if he didn’t concede, Chu Feng would really kill him.

After he conceded, Chu Feng retrieved his spirit power.

Li Fengxue fell powerlessly onto his butt and sat there, completely dumbstruck.

“Thank you for the victory.” Chu Feng clasped his fist towards Li Fengxue with a beaming smile on his face.

Seeing the smile on Chu Feng’s face, Revered Master Beast Tamer grew even more furious. Killing intent even appeared in his eyes.

If Grandmaster Tang Chen wasn’t there, he would definitely smack Chu Feng to death with a palm strike.

“Brother Beast Tamer, you’re someone with status, you shouldn’t go back on your words,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

He could see that Revered Master Beast Tamer’s expression had grown extremely ugly. He seemed like he was truly planning to kill someone.

However, Grandmaster Tang Chen was not afraid of Revered Master Beast Tamer.

After all, he was stronger than him.

If Revered Master Beast Tamer dared act like a sore loser and refused to honor the promise, Grandmaster Tang Chen was determined to teach him a lesson.

“Tang Chen, you can rest assured.”

“Since you, Tang Chen, kept your word, I, Beast Tamer, will definitely take my defeat with grace too.”

As he said those words, Revered Master Beast Tamer took out four Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era’s Spirit Domain and tossed them to Chu Feng.

“Brat, you are truly despicable.”

“You actually dared to trap this old man.”

“Very well. You’ve left an extremely deep impression on this old man.”

After saying those words, Revered Master Beast Tamer did not even bother to bid farewell, and turned to leave at once.

Seeing his master leaving, Li Fengxue immediately got up from the ground and followed suit.

“That Ox-nose truly had some dog-shit luck.”

“He actually managed to find a disciple like you. It would seem that this old man has lost the gamble against him again.”

Grandmaster Tang Chen walked over to Chu Feng and spoke to him with a look of happiness..

Even though Chu Feng was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s disciple, he knew that Chu Feng had fought against Li Fengxue for them.

The humiliation that Yuan Shu had suffered had been returned in double by Chu Feng.

As such, it was only natural for Grandmaster Tang Chen to be happy.

“Senior, this junior failed to breach your spirit formation. Thus, how could you say you’ve lost?” said Chu Feng.

Even though Chu Feng had managed to awaken his bloodline power in Grandmaster Tang Chen’s spirit formation, he had not managed to successfully breach the spirit formation.

“Speaking of that, I am ashamed. You already breached my spirit formation that day.”

“It was just that this old man was unwilling to lose, and had ended up altering the spirit formation.”

“Young friend, please don’t hold it against me.”

“I’ve truly lost to your master too many times, and did not wish to lose again.”

“But, seeing the progress that you’ve made, I have no choice but to admit defeat,” said Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“So I had actually successfully breached the spirit formation that day?”

Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.

But, he didn’t have any intention to blame Grandmaster Tang Chen.

Ignoring the fact that he felt that Grandmaster Tang Chen did not possess any malice, merely the fact that he was able to become the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s close friend was already enough to give a decent impression of him to Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, never would I have imagined that you’ve already grasped rank two Dragon Sensation Transformation already. You little demon, you’re truly too amazing,” Grandmaster Tang Chen praised with admiration.

“Senior, this junior has only comprehended rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation,” Chu Feng did not try to hide the truth from Grandmaster Tang Chen.

“Rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation? But the power of your world spirit techniques were clearly...”

Both Yuan Shu and Grandmaster Tang Chen were shocked to hear those words.

Chu Feng’s spirit formation earlier had clearly reached rank three Utmost Exalted-level.

Thus, how could he have only grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation?
