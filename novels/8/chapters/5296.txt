Chapter 5296: I’ll Let You Know Who Calls the Shots

“Chu Feng, you really came?” Situ Kunye calmly asked.

“Why wouldn’t I come?” Chu Feng replied.

“Since you’re already here, you need not dream of leaving this place alive.”

Situ Kunye waved his sleeves, and a powerful surge of spirit power gushed from his body into the surroundings. It pierced through the clouds and permeated the earth, sealing off the area.

“What a powerful formation!”

“Royal Dragon God-cloak! The Situ World Spiritist Clan’s Clan Chief is a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist!”

The crowd felt deep deference for Situ Kunye after witnessing the overwhelming prowess he had exerted. They hadn’t thought that Situ Kunye would be this powerful, especially since it was a commonly-known fact that Situ Tingye was the strongest individual in the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

This should have meant that Chu Feng was dead meat, but the latter showed no fear on his face.

Why? Why isn’t he afraid? Does he really have someone strong backing him up?

While the crowd was speculating on the situation, Situ Kunye sneered, “Chu Feng, did you think that you can undermine our Situ World Spiritist Clan by tossing a bunch of white bones around? Do you really take everyone to be fools?”

He refused to believe that those bones were real.

“And you call yourself a member of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. Situ Kunye, you spent such a long time cultivating in your ancestral grave. Even if you can’t recognize your ancestors’ bones, you should at least be able to recognize their tombstones. What a filial descendant you are.”

Situ Kunye had initially shrugged off Chu Feng’s antics to be nothing more than a show to fool the crowd, which was why he didn’t bother taking a proper look at the bones and tombstones. But now that he was taking a closer look, his face distorted in horror.

He realized that the tombstones looked authentic. Even if these tombstones were fake, the fact that Chu Feng could craft exact replicas of it meant that he had been to their ancestral grave!

And if Chu Feng had been to their ancestral grave, there was no need for him to go through the trouble of making replicas…

Situ Kunye could no longer remain calm anymore. He shot a glance at Situ Tingye, who quickly caught the drift and rushed off to check on their ancestral grave.

Moments later, Situ Tingye returned with an awful look on his face. He didn’t even need to say a word for Situ Kunye to understand what had happened.

Chu Feng had really dug up their Situ World Spiritist Clan’s ancestral grave.

“You bastard! I’ll mince you into pieces!”

Situ Kunye flew into a state of rage. He had planned to slowly torture Chu Feng, but now, all he wanted to do was to kill the latter. With a hurl of his fist, he sent a flood of martial power toward Chu Feng to smash him into meat paste.

Boom!

The martial power exploded, but Chu Feng remained unharmed. Light flickered around his body. He had been protected by a powerful barrier.

“A protection formation?”

The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were initially not too surprised by the situation. They weren’t so naive to think that Chu Feng could confront them without preparing anything in advance. However, when they took a closer look at the barrier, their hearts lurched in horror.

They noticed that the barrier was manifested from their Situ World Spiritist Clan’s protection formation!

“How did you…?” Situ Kunye’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

Chu Feng ignored him and turned his attention toward the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.

“I have already given a warning. I told you to renounce your ties to the Situ World Spiritist Clan if you wish to live, or else I won’t show any mercy. This will be my final act of kindness to you lot. If you don’t want to be implicated in what happens afterward, I’ll give you two hours to scram right now. Otherwise, you shouldn’t expect me to show you any mercy afterward,” Chu Feng said.

“Are you threatening to massacre our Situ World Spiritist Clan? You? Hah!”

Situ Kunye didn’t buy into Chu Feng’s threat. He unleashed his spirit power to launch another attack against Chu Feng, but he was unable to bypass the barrier. Despite being a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, he was unable to do anything at all. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Don’t waste your effort. Do you think that you’ll be able to breach this protection formation with your skills? This formation was left behind by your ancestor!” Chu Feng sneered.

“You think that I won’t be able to breach it? Chu Feng, you shouldn’t forget that this protection formation belongs to our Situ World Spiritist Clan!”

Situ Kunye took out a token that emanated the same aura as the protection formation. Inscribed on the token was the word ‘Defense’. He formed a hand seal with the token to release Chu Feng’s protection formation.

A second later, his expression stiffened. He realized that he was unable to release the protection formation.

“I thought you were going to do something. Was it just an empty scare?” Chu Feng asked.

“You!!!” Situ Kunye looked as if someone had stuffed crap down his throat.

The crowd could also hardly believe what they were seeing. It didn’t take a genius to figure out what was going on.

Chu Feng was using the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s own protection formation to protect himself, but somehow, Situ Kunye, despite being the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s Clan Chief, was unable to do anything about the protection formation at all.

This was ridiculous, especially considering the fact that they were in the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s territory! There was no greater humiliation than this to the Situ World Spiritist Clan!

“Chu Feng, don’t get gleeful!”

Situ Kunye gritted his teeth. Determination flickered across his eyes as he formed another hand seal.

“Lord Clan Chief!”

Upon seeing the hand seal, Situ Tingye hurriedly rushed forward to stop Situ Kunye. He knew that the hand seal would unleash the full force of the protection formation. In other words, Situ Kunye was planning to deplete the protection formation’s energy to render Chu Feng vulnerable.

However, this move would also be highly damaging to the Situ World Spiritist Clan. This was the protection formation left behind by their ancestor, and it had protected them for many years!

“You’re hoping to deplete the formation’s energy as quickly as possible in order to dispel my barrier? It looks like you have run out of options.” Chu Feng chuckled.

The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were baffled. They couldn’t understand why Chu Feng could remain calm despite having seen through Situ Kunye’s intention.

Situ Kunye understood that Chu Feng had other tricks up his sleeves, but how could he back down now? It was already too late for regrets, not to mention that his ancestors were literally watching him here!

Without any hesitation, he formed the hand seal and channeled the token’s energy.

Boom!

Chu Feng’s protection formation became visibly stronger, but its energy consumption greatly increased too.

“Chu Feng!” Eggy panicked.

“It’s fine. I have other ways to stop him,” Chu Feng replied.

“Hurry up and stop him then!” Eggy couldn’t understand why Chu Feng was dawdling around.

“I’m doing it on purpose. It’ll take at least two hours to fully deplete the energy of the protection formation, and I’m confident of grasping the ‘Offense’ formation within two hours,” Chu Feng replied.

“But…” Eggy wanted to say that it was too risky, but she decided against it.

The fact that Chu Feng had chosen to do this showed that he was absolutely confident of pulling it off. In other words, he didn’t even see this as a risk at all.

Yue Lian had also rushed over to watch the commotion, but he stayed in the shadows and didn’t reveal himself.

“Milord, why is Chu Feng so confident? Does he really have someone backing him?” Yue Lian’s subordinate asked.

“I don’t know, but I hope that Chu Feng wins here. The bastards of the Situ World Spiritist Clan deserve to die,” Yue Lian replied with gritted teeth.

“Fools of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, you must be curious to know why I have set a time limit of two hours. Out of the generosity of my heart, I’ll clear your doubt,” Chu Feng said.

With a wave of his sleeves, he brought out another formation inside the protection formation. It was the ‘Offense’ formation.

The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen nearly fainted from anger upon seeing the ‘Offense’ formation. That was a legacy left behind by their ancestor, but Chu Feng actually brought it out in the open!

“This is a formation left behind by the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. Today, I’ll use the power left behind by the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s founder to destroy them,” Chu Feng declared to the crowd.

“This formation belongs to the Situ World Spiritist Clan too?”

The crowd was baffled by the turn of events. It was almost as if Chu Feng had ransacked the Situ World Spiritist Clan!

They had thought of various reasons as to why Chu Feng had chosen to make an appearance despite the odds stacked against him, such as him having powerful backing or formidable treasures, but they would have never thought that he would deal with the Situ World Spiritist Clan through such a manner.

Should he really succeed, the Situ World Spiritist Clan would become a laughingstock! How incompetent would the Situ World Spiritist Clan have to be to allow others to destroy them using their own ancestor’s power?

“Hahaha!”

Situ Kunye suddenly burst into laughter.

“Chu Feng, you’re underestimating our Situ World Spiritist Clan! There’s no way you’ll be able to grasp control over our formation, let alone do it within two hours. Is that the ace you have up your sleeves? How disappointing!”

Situ Tingye didn’t think that Chu Feng would be able to grasp control of the ‘Offense’ formation. There was no one in the world who knew better than him how intricate the formation was. Even he had only been able to grasp a small portion of it after many years of effort. It was impossible for Chu Feng to grasp full control of the formation within two hours!

“Heh…” Chu Feng chuckled.

With the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk in hand, he began working on the ‘Offense’ formation. Within seconds, the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen’s complexions turned awful.

“Lord Clan Chief, he seems to be… gaining control over the formation,” an elder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan said.

“I won’t allow that to happen,” Situ Kunye spat through clenched jaws.

He took out another token bearing the word ‘Offense’. He formed a series of hand seals, and the token began to vibrate. He was intending to use the token to seal off the ‘Offense’ formation so that Chu Feng wouldn’t be able to grasp control of it.

The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen heaved a sigh of relief. They noticed that the rate at which Chu Feng grasped control over the ‘Offense’ formation was slowing down.

“Ey, it’s the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s formation, after all. There’s no way an outsider could grasp control of it that easily.”

Many of the onlookers shook their heads. While they thought that what Chu Feng had done thus far was incredible, it was simply too far-fetched for him to steal the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s formation right under Situ Kunye’s nose.

What Chu Feng did next shocked the crowd.

Chu Feng raised the Celestial Master’s Horsetail Whisk and flicked it.

Kacha!

The token bearing the word ‘Offense’ shattered. Chu Feng had terminated the connection between Situ Kunye and the ‘Offense’ formation!

Situ Kunye was dumbfounded. He stared at the shattered token in his hand with a blank look, unable to come to terms with what had just happened.

“Useless things. Do you finally understand who calls the shots here?” Chu Feng sneered.
