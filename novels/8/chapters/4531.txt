Chapter 4531 - Grasping The Hero’s Sword

“Lord City Master, you... you agreed to it? The previous condition was already...”

“If it’s doubled, wouldn’t our Ancestral Martial Dragon City...?”

The elders of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were all on the verge of crying.

The demand raised by them was already very harsh.

That was the reason why Long Daozhi had been thinking over things and not accepting it the entire time.

Yet now, they actually demanded for double. That would simply be equivalent to hollowing out their entire Ancestral Martial Dragon City’s accumulated wealth of multiple generations.

Yet, Long Daozhi actually accepted the offer.

“Right now, the issue is no longer about returning to the Dragon Clan. Instead, this matter now concerns young friend Chu Feng’s life. After all, that Dian Kuang is Lord Long Yinfeng’s benefactor,” said Long Daozhi.

The Ancestral Martial Dragon City and the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect actually had no prior conflicts. Furthermore, in terms of their strength, the two powers were actually on par.

But, the reason why they requested for the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect to come here was precisely so that they could obtain their help in returning to the Dragon Clan.

Dian Kuang, the younger brother of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect’s Sectmaster, was the reason why the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect was able to help them.

That Dian Kuang had, by pure chance, saved the Dragon Clan’s Supreme Elder Long Yinfeng.

Long Yinfeng was someone who cared a lot about the graces he received from others. As such, he will most definitely try his best to fulfill the requests of his benefactor.

Because of that, ever since Dian Kuang saved Long Yinfeng, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect not only received the protection of the Dragon Clan, and Long Yinfeng, despite his high and aloof standing, even came by to personally pay visit and reminisce with Dian Kuang.

It was precisely because of the relationship Dian Kuang had with Long Yinfeng that Long Daozhi sought for their help.

Mainly, there have been abandoned Dragon Clansmen that sought for Dian Kuang’s help and managed to successfully return to the Dragon Clan with his help.

However, Long Daozhi never imagined for the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect to put forth such an outrageous demand. He found it difficult to accept their conditions. That was the reason why he pondered without accepting their condition for so long.

But, things were different now. Chu Feng offended the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect. Because of that, he had no choice but to reach terms with them.

While it was fine for him to abandon the chance to return to the Dragon Clan, he cannot disregard Chu Feng’s life.

“Lord City Master, didn’t you say that young hero Chu Feng had, by chance, gotten to know the Dragon Clan’s princess?”

“Does someone like him still need to fear the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect?” questioned an elder from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

Long Daozhi informed his clansmen what he and Chu Feng experienced upon his return. Because of that, they all knew a bit about what happened back then.

“While it is true that young friend Chu Feng knows the princess of the Dragon Clan, they are merely strangers that came together by chance.”

“I’ve met that princess myself. Her Highness is a very intelligent person. I believe that she is not someone who will be willing to offend a Lord Supreme Elder for Chu Feng, especially not a Supreme Elder of Long Yinfeng’s caliber.

“The Dragon Clan has many open conflicts and hidden strife. While the princess is of noble status, her standing is most definitely inferior to that of a Supreme Elder in the Dragon Clan, where strength mattered most.

“That is especially the case since that Supreme Elder is Long Yinfeng, a Martial Exalted level expert. He’s one of the strongest people in the Dragon Clan apart from the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Furthermore, Long Yinfeng’s personality is different from others. He is someone who cares deeply about the graces he received. He is someone that will not hesitate to have a fall out with the Dragon Clan for Dian Kuang.”

Helplessness filled Long Daozhi’s voice.

Hearing those words from Long Daozhi, Long NIng and the others from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City all fell silent. They felt what Long Daozhi said made a lot of sense.

What they didn’t know was that while Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao were merely strangers that met by chance back then, their relationship had long changed...

The relationship Chu Feng had with the Dragon Clan was now completely different.

Not to mention Long Yinfeng, practically no one in the entire Dragon Clan would dare to offend Chu Feng.

...

After Long Daozhi and others left, Chu Feng took out the Immemorial Hero’s Sword. He began to focus on sensing the powers of the Ancient Era’s mystic ground.

Ultimately, Chu Feng discovered that the Ancient Era’s mystic ground not only possessed rich natural energies, it also contained a special sort of power.

If one was to train normally in the Ancient Era’s mystic ground, one’s cultivation might not be able to increase much quicker than normal.

But, if one was to train martial skills in here, the Ancient Era’s mystic ground will provide great aid.

Mainly, it was due to the special power of this place being able to increase a martial cultivator’s appeal to one’s weapons.

In other words, one would be able to utilize weapons that one cannot control in this Ancient Era’s mystic ground.

After being in the Ancient Era’s mystic ground for six hours, Chu Feng managed to successfully grasp the power of the Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

But, while he was now able to use the Immemorial Hero’s Sword, Chu Feng was not particularly happy.

“Sigh... Is this the extent of my grasp?”

He was even slightly disappointed.

Even though he managed to grasp the Immemorial Hero’s Sword and was now able to utilize this Exalted Armament, he was incapable of unleashing its true power.

Furthermore, he was unable to make any more progress in the mastery of the Immemorial Hero’s Sword inside the Ancient Era’s mystic ground.

Being able to grasp the usage of the Immemorial Hero’s Sword was already the limit of the Ancient Era’s mystic ground’s power.

“It would appear that I’ll have to rely on myself in the end.”

After sighing, Chu Feng placed away the Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

While he was unable to grasp the Immemorial Hero’s Sword completely, it remains that he was now able to utilize an Exalted Armament.

No matter what, the Immemorial Hero’s Sword was much stronger than Incomplete Exalted Armaments. As such, this journey was not made in vain.

Besides, Chu Tian had discovered the Ancient Era’s mystic ground’s secret. As such, he would be able to properly report back to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

After Chu Feng pushed open the entrance gate of the Ancient Era’s mystic ground, he discovered Long Ning and others were still waiting for him out there.

But, a single person was missing - Long Daozhi.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re out! Did you find anything?”

The crowd were all very happy to see Chu Feng. Kong Tianhui even stepped forward to greet and ask him.

Chu Feng informed them of his discovery.

Kong Tianhui and others were all excited to hear Chu Feng’s discovery, and they felt overjoyed for the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.

But, Chu Feng noticed that Long Ning, the princess of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, had a worried frown on her face even though everyone else was beaming with happiness.

“Miss Long, what’s wrong?” Chu Feng stepped forward and asked with concern.

“Little sister Long Ning, brother Chu Feng came out. He also discovered the secret of this Ancient Era’s mystic ground. Why are you not happy?” Kong Tianhui asked too.

Kong Tianhui and others did not accompany Long Daozhi to pay a visit to the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect. Thus, they have no idea what had happened.

But, they knew that Long Ning had been sulky ever since her return. It was so much that she wasn’t even responding to them when they spoke to her.

Kong Tianhui knew Long Ning for a very long time. Yet, this was the first time he saw her this dispirited.

“Chu Feng, I know that you possess exceptional talent and are not someone that we can compare to.”

“But, I beg you this. Please stop causing troubles in the future. Even if you don’t care about yourself, you should show some consideration for others still,” Long Ning said to Chu Feng. Her attitude was slightly vile.

“Miss Long, what do you mean by that? Could it be because of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect? Did they come seeking troubles because of me?”

Chu Feng felt that Long Ning would not act this way without reason. The only reason he could think of would be the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.

“I do not wish to speak about this matter anymore. I only wish for you to shape up,” Long Ning planned to leave after saying those words.

But, Chu Feng’s body shifted and stopped her.

“Miss Long, I do not possess any malice. I merely wish for you to tell me clearly as to what had happened.”

“Did the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect do something?” asked Chu Feng.

“You don’t have to bother asking. It would do as long as you stop causing troubles in the future.”

Long Ning was unwilling to talk. Long Daozhi told her that she cannot tell Chu Feng that their Ancestral Martial Dragon City had compensated the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect on Chu Feng’s behalf.

“It’s fine if you don’t tell me. I’ll go and seek out the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect myself.

“If they dared to make things difficult for you all, I’ll have their Flying Feather Heavenly Sect disappear from this world.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng planned to leave.

“Stop!”

Seeing that Chu Feng was intending to seek out the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, Long NIng immediately shouted for him to stop. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She was becoming extremely emotional. It was as if she was no longer able to repress the anger in her heart. At this moment, that anger erupted.

She began to loudly shout at Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, why are you so incapable of listening to others?!

“Yes, I admit that you are extremely talented! I admit that we cannot be discussed alongside you!

“I admit that, with your talent, you will one day stand at the apex of the Holy Light Galaxy should you not encounter any accidents! But, having only talent wouldn’t do in this world. One also needs background!”

“If you continue to act so recklessly and stir up troubles nonstop, you will one day provoke people that you cannot afford to provoke! Talented you may be, you will still be strangled and killed before your full potential!”

Long Ning was simply roaring her words.

“It would appear that Flying Feather Heavenly Sect is one with some background. Why don’t you tell me exactly what sort of background they possess. I wish to see if I can afford to provoke them or not.”

Chu Feng realized that the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect seemed to be more remarkable than he imagined.

Chu Feng was not an impetuous person. Right now, all he wanted to do was to figure out what sort of backing the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect possessed.

“The Dragon Clan! The Dragon Clan’s strongest Supreme Elder, Long Yinfeng! He is the backing of the Flying Feather Heavenly Clan!”

Long Ning was completely enraged and unable to maintain her calm. Thus, she revealed the backing of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.

She even revealed how the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect came to cause trouble for him and, for the sake of preventing them, Long Daozhi gave in to their demands.

“Thus, senior Long had agreed to the demands of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect?” asked Chu Feng.
