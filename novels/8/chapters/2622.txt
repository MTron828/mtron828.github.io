Chapter 2622 - Unable To Contend Against

“Exactly where did you obtain that Demon Armament of yours?” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster asked.

However, Chu Feng completely ignored the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. Instead, he turned to Zi Xunyi, who had caught Ying Mingchao, “Senior, bring them away from here.”

“No, we cannot leave you here alone,” Before Zi Xunyi could answer, Zhao Hong voiced her disagreement.

“Listen to me, get away from here!”

Chu Feng shouted. His tone actually contained intense amount of anger.

Once his words were said, the expressions of the crowd from the allied army all changed.

The reason for that was because not only did they feel anger from Chu Feng’s tone, but they even felt killing intent when Chu Feng said those words.

That killing intent was ice-cold. It did not appear to be there merely to scare them. It was as if... Chu Feng would really end up killing them.

“Everyone, we will not be able to help little friend Chu Feng by staying here. Only by leaving will we be able to help him. Let’s get away from here.”

Right at this moment, Kong Shunlian spoke to urge the crowd to leave. Following him, Kong Yuehua and the guardian clan’s clan chief also began to urge the crowd to leave.

They were people that had experienced the might of Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword. Thus, they knew that Chu Feng would suffer a backlash from using the Evil God Sword.

In the end, Chu Feng would not be able to control himself, and would be devoured by the Demon Armament.

If they did not leave now, then they... would soon not only be people that Chu Feng would have to protect, but they would also... become people that Chu Feng would slaughter.

“Leave now!!!” Chu Feng shouted.

At that moment, the crimson clouds in the sky surged about even more violently. In fact, it was no longer as simple as only surging about.

The reason for that was because strange sounds were being emitted by the crimson clouds as they surged about. Those sounds were too strange, so strange that the crowd trembled with fear upon hearing them.

“Let’s go.”

Seeing the situation at hand, Zi Xunyi no longer hesitated. She led the crowd and left.

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster did not stop them. At that moment, he was staring at Chu Feng.

“Hey! I am asking you a question here!” The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster called for Chu Feng.

“You wish to talk with me? I’m sorry, but I have no time to bother with your rubbish. Right now... there is only one thing that I wish to do.”

“As for that, it is to make you suffer a miserable death,” Chu Feng said to the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

When Chu Feng said those words, his eyes turned blood-red. It was as if they were simply no longer his eyes at all.

Furthermore, an extremely wicked smile emerged on Chu Feng’s face.

The current Chu Feng was filled with a heinous air, filled with a demonic aura. Even though he had the same appearance as before, the crimson gaseous flames that covered him were rising nonstop.

At a glance, he no longer resembled a human. Rather, he resembled an actual... demon!!!

“Don’t you try to scare me. I have trained in the Infant Soul Demonic Technique for this long, and refined countless infants. You are simply seeking your own disgrace by pretending to be a demon before me!!!”

“I shall have you know exactly what an actual demon is!!!”

After the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster finished saying those words, dark black gaseous flames exploded out from his body. The dark black gaseous flames no longer entered the sky. Instead, they began to revolve around him, taking his image.

Although the body of the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster remained unchanged, the dark black gaseous flames were simply too overwhelming. As such, the image that they formed was simply enormous. It was like a black flame giant.

Most importantly, it was not only enormous, but the black gaseous flames were also emitting extremely sinister and horrifying infant cries. They were like the roars of ghosts that had died unjustly and sought revenge.

A heinous air. Boundless amount of heinous air filled the entire surrounding region.

If it were someone else, they would most definitely be scared witless upon seeing such an Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

However, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. Moreover, the smile he had on his face became more and more mocking.

“You dare look down on me?! I will have you know how powerful I am right now!”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster grew incomparably furious. The Dragonscale Dagger in his hand started to shine brightly with golden light.

As he waved his arm unceasingly, countless golden blade rays were shot forth. Like a golden torrential rain, they flew toward Chu Feng.

However, faced with such an attack by the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster, Chu Feng did not even bother to move. In fact, he did not even bother to move the Evil God Sword in his hand.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Although Chu Feng did not move, countless clusters of crimson gaseous flame flew down from the crimson clouds in the sky above. Like a wall, they appeared before Chu Feng.

“Rumble~~~”

The next moment, the golden blade rays started to bombard the crimson gaseous flames.

However, when the golden blade rays finished bombarding the crimson gaseous flames, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was shocked to discover that not a single one of the many vine-like crimson gaseous flames that had emerged from the sky were damaged by the golden blade rays.

“How could this be?!” At that moment, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster grew extremely panicked.

Earlier, when the crimson gaseous flames were attacking him, he was able to easily slice them apart with the golden blade rays sent forth by the Dragonscale Dagger.

However, even though he had clearly increased the power of the golden blade rays just now, he was actually unable to cause any damage to the crimson gaseous flames.

There could only be one possible explanation for this -- the crimson gaseous flames had become more powerful, so powerful that he could not contend against them.

“You’re a demon?” Right at that moment, Chu Feng spoke.

“You are nothing more than an animal completely devoid of conscience who only knows about bullying the small and weak.”

“Demon, how could someone like you possibly qualify for the title of demon?”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, crimson gaseous flames began to descend from everywhere the crimson clouds covered the sky.

At a glance, there were millions and millions of vine-like crimson gaseous flames shooting straight down from the crimson clouds.

It was an extremely frightening sight.

That said, a sight like that was also extremely spectacular.

However, that sight was akin to a nightmare to the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster. Seeing it, he became extremely frightened.

The current him was unable to even cut apart a single crimson stretch of gaseous flames. As such, facing millions and millions of crimson gaseous flames, he had no idea what to do.

“God damn it!”

The Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was no longer as egotistical and arrogant as he was before. He was so scared that his face turned pale and his body started shivering.

Suddenly, his body shifted, and he disappeared.

He had escaped. He knew that he was no match for Chu Feng. Thus, he chose to escape.

Afraid that Chu Feng would capture him, he deliberately used special methods to conceal himself.

However, Chu Feng did not panic at all upon seeing the escape attempt. In fact, he had the same mocking smile on his face the entire time.

Mockery, it was truly mockery.

It was as if a fierce tiger was mocking a mouse before killing it.

The mouse has already entered the tiger’s killing range, yet it was still attempting to escape. Oh how ridiculous that was.

“Eeahhh!!!”

As expected, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster’s miserable scream soon sounded from the distance. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

There was a stretch of crimson gaseous flames at the location where the scream had sounded. Merely, that stretch of crimson gaseous flames was different from the others. It was coiling around something.

As for that something, it was the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster.

Following that miserable scream, the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster soon appeared.

The current Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster was in a very sorry state.

This time around, his entire body was covered by the crimson gaseous flames. The crimson gaseous flames were current burning away at his body.

Thus, his screams were over a hundred times more miserable than the time when his arm was being burned away.

It was truly a pain so miserable that he wished he was dead.
