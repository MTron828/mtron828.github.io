Chapter 5681: The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster Visits

The Seven Stars Gravity Towers had seven towers, and each of them had seven floors.

The first two floors didn’t pose much of a challenge to Jie Feng, but his footsteps significantly slowed when he arrived at the third floor. Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth and pushed himself to the fourth floor in a single shot.

He stopped right at the entrance of the fourth floor and rested for a while before he looked downward and murmured, “There’s no sound at all. Is he unable to clear even the first floor?”

Jie Feng shook his head before pushing ahead, but it was getting more strenuous. By the time he reached the sixth floor, every step had already become a challenge to him. Each step felt so distant to him. Soon, he didn’t even have the strength to raise his leg anymore.

It was as if he was glued to the steps. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Damn it, I’m stuck here again! Why can’t I reach the top? Is our generation really weaker than the current generation of juniors?” Jie Feng felt both exhausted and indignant.

“What’s wrong? Are you at your limit?” Chu Feng’s voice suddenly sounded.

Jie Feng quickly turned around and was taken aback. Chu Feng had caught up with him without him knowing, and there was not a droplet of sweat to be seen on his face.

It was almost as if they hadn’t been climbing the same tower.

“W-what’s with you?” Jie Feng asked.

“What do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.

“Why are you not tired at all?” Jie Feng asked.

“That’s because I don’t feel strained at all,” Chu Feng replied as he continued scaling the tower.

Where Jie Feng needed to exert arduous effort to take a single step, Chu Feng walked as if he was walking on normal stairs. Jie Feng stared at Chu Feng with widened eyes.

“Should I feign difficulty, lest I wound your pride? But I really don’t feel strained at all,” Chu Feng remarked.

“Don’t get ahead of yourself, Chu Feng. There’s no guarantee that you can get to the top even if you’re able to reach the seventh floor. You won’t be able to withstand the pressure,” Jie Feng said with gritted teeth.

“Thanks for your reminder,” Chu Feng said.

As soon as he stepped onto the seventh floor, he stopped moving.

“The seventh floor poses a bit of a challenge,” Chu Feng murmured as he closed his eyes.

He intended to use the same method—first adapt to the floor, then clear it in a single push.

…

Meanwhile, in the depths of a Sacred Mansion, there was a hot spring harnessing tremendous energy floating above the clouds. Every droplet of water inside this hot spring was invaluable.

An old man was bathing in the hot spring. He had white hair and a ten-meter-long white beard that floated in mid-air. From time to time, he would let out a groan of pleasure that showed how much he enjoyed the hot spring.

All of a sudden, his eyes opened and he shot to his feet while emanating incomparably powerful pressure. Despite his wrinkled face, he stood at a height of over three meters, and his body was incredibly muscular.

He sensed that someone was coming.

However, he soon retracted the powerful pressure and an amicable smile formed on his face. “Ah, it’s the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master.”

The old man turned around and donned a thin white robe that made him look like a dignified immortal.

“How are you feeling, Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster?” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked.

“Not bad. Your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Air Spring is truly a delight,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster replied.

“We obtained the Air Spring together. Feel free to bathe in it whenever you like. But if I’m not mistaken, you aren’t just here for the Air Spring, right?” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master looked at the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster with an enigmatic smile before suddenly asking, “Have you been to the Totem Dragon Clan?”

The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster was taken aback. “Not in recent days. Why do you suddenly ask that?”

“You haven’t?” The eyes of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master turned sharp.

“I haven’t,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster replied.

The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master quietly stared at the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster with a smile. As the overlord of a galaxy, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster had weathered many storms, but the other party’s smile still made him feel uncomfortable.

All of a sudden, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master asked, “Supposing that someone unites the world of cultivation, who do you think is worthy of calling the shots?”

“It goes without saying that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is the most worthy one to call the shots,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster said,

“Do you mean it?”

“Of course! If a day comes when we need someone to unite and lead the world of cultivation, you can be certain that I’ll support you,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster said.

“Those words are enough for me,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied with a smile.

Even though the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master had been smiling all this while, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster only relaxed at this point.

Weng!

A pillar of golden light suddenly pierced the clouds, catching both their attention.

It was a far distance away, but they could see that it was coming from a tower.

“Is that a cultivation tower?” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster asked out of curiosity.

He could tell that there was something special about the tower and the pillar of golden light. Something significant must have happened.

“It’s coming from the Seven Stars Gravity Tower I personally constructed. It looks like someone has reached its top,” the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master replied.

“Is it a difficult trial?”

“A little.” The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master’s eyes were focused on the tower as he spoke. He was curious to know who had reached the top.

“Why don’t we head over to take a look?”

“You’re interested?”

“I have nothing better to do anyway. I’m curious to see which of your juniors have induced such a phenomenon,” the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster replied.

“Let’s go then.”

Thus, the two galaxy overlords made their way toward the Seven Stars Gravity Tower.
