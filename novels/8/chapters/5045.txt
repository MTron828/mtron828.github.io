Chapter 5045: About the Monstrous Spirit Clan

Having come to a decision, the group quickly set off.

Through secret conversations he had with the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea via voice transmission, Chu Feng learned that Yao Cheng hadn’t reached Half-God level yet, though she was likely to be at pinnacle Martial Exalted level at the very least.

But rather than Yao Cheng’s cultivation, Chu Feng was much more curious about Yao Cheng’s clan. Based on the Godwish Grandmother and Lady of Dao Sea’s reactions, he could tell that the Monstrous Spirit Clan was a powerful clan.

He was just going to inquire about it, but someone else beat him to it.

“Elders, can you tell me more about the Monstrous Spirit Clan?” Princess Xiaoxiao sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng, the Godwish Grandmother, and the Lady of Dao Sea simultaneously.

Chu Feng looked at Princess Xiaoxiao in astonishment.

It was one thing for an outsider of the Nine Souls Galaxy like him to have not heard about the Monstrous Spirit Clan, but Princess Xiaoxiao was a member of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. It was surprising for her to have not heard about them too.

“Princess Xiaoxiao, you have never heard of the Monstrous Spirit Clan?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked via voice transmission.

“Yes, I’ve never heard of them before,” Princess Xiaoxiao replied.

“I’ve heard that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan has sealed off information about the Monstrous Spirit Clan, but I didn’t think that they would withhold that information to their own clan members too,” the Godwish Grandmother remarked mockingly.

Her words brought a change to Chu Feng and Princess Xiaoxiao’s expression. The two of them immediately understood the implied meaning behind those words—there was a history between the Nine Souls Sacred Clan and the Monstrous Spirit Clan.

“Actually, the two of us only learned about the Monstrous Spirit Clan’s existence by coincidence. That’s why we weren’t certain about whether they really exist or not.”

With that, the Godwish Grandmother began sharing the background of the Monstrous Spirit Clan.

The Monstrous Spirit Clan were descendants of a race from the Ancient Era, and they could be said to be one of the indigenous clans of the Nine Souls Galaxy. Despite their old lineage, their strength had always been so-so.

During the warring era, the Monstrous Spirit Clan was able to survive only because they chose to maintain a neutral position. They had no wish to rule the world, so no one viewed them as a threat. By the time the Nine Souls Sacred Clan united the Nine Souls Galaxy, the Monstrous Spirit Clan had already partially faded into the background.

But all of a sudden, the Monstrous Spirit Clan abruptly grew stronger.

According to the rumors, the Monstrous Spirit Clan had obtained a unique power along with a special energy. It was said that the power and the energy would grant great strength to its wielder if one was able to control them, possibly even to the extent of threatening the Nine Souls Sacred Clan’s rule.

Those rumors were unfounded at that juncture, but the Nine Souls Sacred Clan wasn’t about to take a risk. Thus, they began making a move to eradicate the Monstrous Spirit Clan.

The Nine Souls Sacred Clan was still at its peak back then, such that the Monstrous Spirit Clan didn’t stand a chance at all. The battle resulted in huge losses for the Monstrous Spirit Clan, but quite a few members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan still managed to get away. The Nine Souls Sacred Clan tried pursuing them but to no avail.

Ever since then, no one had seen the Monstrous Spirit Clan anymore. It was as if they had vanished from the face of the world.

In any case, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan had achieved their goal.

It was also around that period of time that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan started sealing off all news surrounding the Monstrous Spirit Clan, such that those three words became taboo in the Nine Souls Galaxy.

As time went by, the Monstrous Spirit Clan was forgotten by the world. Even in the historical records, their name was nowhere to be found.

“Such a thing actually happened?” Princess Xiaoxiao exclaimed with a deep frown.

She had a feeling that this wasn’t just a fabricated story. For that reason, she felt deeply ashamed for what her ancestors had done. It was simply tyrannical of them to massacre a clan just to reinforce their rule.

“To be frank, I’m still not very certain whether Yao Cheng is really a member of the Monstrous Spirit Clan. Based on what we have heard, there are no men in the Monstrous Spirit Clan. They reproduce through a rather peculiar method.

“Other than that, the members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan were known to be great beauties, but while Yao Cheng’s physical traits do correspond to that of the Monstrous Spirit Clan, it seems a little far-fetched to claim that she’s beautiful,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

“She might have disguised her appearance,” Chu Feng suggested.

“I see no reason for her to disguise her appearance when she’s retaining all of her physical traits as a monstrous spirit,” the Lady of Dao Sea replied.

Chu Feng agreed with those words too.

However, this was not a matter of great importance. Considering how long the Monstrous Spirit Clan had vanished from the world, it wouldn’t be surprising if there were some deviations from the records.

Along the way, Chu Feng and the others tried to ask Yao Cheng about the Monstrous Spirit Clan, but the latter appeared reluctant to talk about her clan. Due to that, they weren’t able to learn anything more about the Monstrous Spirit Clan.

They swiftly traversed through a teleportation formation and continued rushing ahead till they finally arrived at a beautiful floating mountain range.

“Elder, are we here now?” the Lady of Dao Sea asked.

“Yes, we’re here,” Yao Cheng replied with a nod.

“It’s actually this place?”

There was a peculiar look on the Lady of Dao Sea’s face as she spoke.

Meanwhile, Yao Cheng began forming a series of hand seals to open the gate leading into the Monstrous Spirit Clan.

Out of the blue, the sky and earth started to rattle. Snowflakes soon started falling from the sky. It wouldn’t have been as surprising if not for the fact that the sky was clear. The snowflakes quickly accumulated, and it didn’t take long for their surroundings to be covered in snow.

These snowflakes were emanating a faint light that dissipated upon touch. They weren’t real snowflakes but manifestations of a phenomenon.

“It’s coming from that direction.”

Chu Feng activated the Heaven’s Eye and quickly pointed southwest. That was where the phenomenon was originating from.

“That’s where Lele is cultivating! Did she succeed?” the Lady of Dao Sea exclaimed in excitement.

“Lele? What is she doing here?” Chu Feng asked in bewilderment.

He knew that the Lady of Dao Sea was referring to Wang Yuxian. After parting ways that day, Wang Yuxian left together with her seniors from the Dao Sea… but they were nowhere near the Dao Sea right now.

“Junior Chu Feng, this is the place where I often bring Lele and the others to cultivate. We have been using this place for quite a few years now, which is why I’m surprised that the Monstrous Spirit Clan was located here too,” the Lady of Dao Sea explained.

That made it clear why the Lady of Dao Sea was clearly surprised when she saw Yao Cheng stopping here.
