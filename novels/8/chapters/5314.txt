Chapter 5314: Inscribing New Names

Jia Chengying and Bai Yunqing’s faces stiffened upon hearing those words. The crowd revealed confused looks. 

“What a joke. This divine monument is in front of me, but you’re claiming possession of it?” Instead of releasing his hand from the divine monument, Jia Chengying turned around to mock Chu Feng.

He wouldn’t admit to having lost control of his divine monument even though he knew that the golden light emanating from his divine monument was caused by Chu Feng. 

Bai Yunqing also looked troubled. He knew that Chu Feng had taken control of his divine monument and was planning to admit defeat here, but doing so now would only prove that Jia Chengying had lied. That would put Jia Chengying into an awkward position. 

Knowing that Bai Yunqing would help him conceal the truth, Jia Chengying shamelessly stood his ground and said, “Chu Feng, do you think that you’re the only talented one here who can release such radiance? You’re too arrogant.”

However, those words were only met with Chu Feng’s laughter. At the same time, the expressions of the crowd turned odd. 

Jia Chengying was confused. He couldn’t comprehend their bizarre responses.

“Brother Jia, look at the name on the divine monument,” Bai Yunqing told Jia Chengying via voice transmission.

Jia Chengying quickly turned to look at his divine monument, and his face immediately paled. Chu Xuanyan’s name was still on the divine monument, but an additional name was overlapped on top of it—Chu Feng.

It looked like Chu Xuanyan and Chu Feng were currently fighting over the divine monument. 

Chu Feng’s name had also surfaced on the ten other nameless divine monuments, indicating that they had acknowledged Chu Feng as their master. 

“Are you still going to continue the act? Don’t you feel embarrassed?” Chu Feng looked at Jia Chengying with playful eyes.

“You!!!”

Feeling humiliated, Jia Chengying gritted his teeth in anger. He released his hand from the divine monument and left the square. At the same time, he sent a message to Chu Feng via voice transmission, “You have guts, Chu Feng. I’ll return this favor to you many times over in the future.”

Chu Feng didn’t pay much heed to Jia Chengying’s threat. It was not the first time Jia Chengying had threatened him anyway. 

Bai Yunqing also released his hand from the divine monument and left the square. 

Through their actions, the people of the Ancient Realm could tell that the two of them had lost connection with the divine monument, and the two divine monuments were solely devouring Chu Feng’s energy now. 

The people of the Ancient Realm were truly impressed by how Chu Feng could single-handedly infuse his energy into so many Ancestral Divine Monument and receive their acknowledgment. This was the Ancestral Divine Monument they were talking about here! The people understood just how formidable a feat it was. 

“Chu Feng reminds me of the man from eight hundred years ago, Chu Xuanyan. No, he is even more formidable than Chu Xuanyan.”

The elders talked amongst themselves.

They were reminded of the events eight hundred years ago, how a young man named Chu Xuanyan stood forward like a hero after all of the other challengers in the Ancestral Ritual had fallen. He single-handedly infused eleven Ancestral Divine Monuments with his energy. 

That sight shocked everyone. They thought that he had gone suicidal trying to accomplish something impossible. Yet, he successfully filled the square with the same blinding golden light they were seeing today. 

It was a sight that shocked them to the core, and they could still remember it as if it was yesterday.

The golden light they were witnessing today was even brighter than what they saw eight hundred years ago. After all, Chu Feng was single-handedly infusing eighteen of the Divine Ancestral Monuments with his energy!

In fact, they could tell that Chu Feng had the capability to fill all twenty-one Ancestral Divine Monuments with energy if he truly wanted to. It was only out of respect for the white-haired woman, Zhou Dong, and Qin Shu that he had refrained from doing so. 

Chu Feng closed his eyes to comprehend the martial enlightenment inside the divine monuments.

“Chu Feng, why don’t you snatch the remaining divine monuments over too? Isn’t it better to grasp as much martial enlightenment as possible?” Eggy asked.

“There’s no need for that. The martial enlightenment I have received is sufficient. I’ll do them a favor this time around and see how they react. If they don’t reciprocate, they shouldn’t blame me for turning against them later on,” Chu Feng said before finally releasing his palm from the divine monument, thus stopping the energy infusion.

Ten of the Ancestral Divine Monuments carried his name, but the remaining eleven were still inscribed with Chu Xuanyan’s name. While Chu Feng’s name did overlap with Chu Xuanyan’s on eight of the monuments, his name faded when he stopped supplying them with energy. 

“If those divine monuments didn’t change owners, does that mean that Chu Xuanyan’s talent is above that of Chu Feng’s?”

Many people in the Ancient Realm thought that Chu Feng had failed to break Chu Xuanyan’s record.

“That’s hard to say. Chu Feng simultaneously supplied eighteen of the Ancestral Divine Monument with energy. His achievement clearly exceeded that of Chu Xuanyan’s back then.”

Numerous guesses floated about, but most people could agree that Chu Feng was an incredible prodigy. Filling eighteen divine monuments with energy was a completely different concept from just filling one up.

“Chu Feng, you did it on purpose, didn’t you? You had the power to replace your father’s name earlier,” Eggy asked.

“How can I erase a mark of my father? Besides, my goal is to obtain the martial enlightenment. The rest isn’t important.”

Chu Feng’s words verified Eggy’s guess. He could have placed his name on the other Ancestral Divine Monuments too, but he chose not to do so because those were left by his father. He couldn’t bear to do so.

“Is the martial enlightenment inside the divine monuments enough for you to make a breakthrough?” Eggy asked.

“Yes, the martial enlightenment here is much more potent. I have already grasped the way to make a breakthrough. All I lack now is martial power. As long as I obtain sufficient martial power, I’ll be able to advance to Half-God level straight away,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s wonderful. You won’t need me to protect you anymore once you reach Half-God level,” Eggy said.

“I’ll be the one to protect Milady Queen then,” Chu Feng said.

“That sounds not too bad either.” Eggy chuckled.

The white-haired woman, Qin Shu, and Zhou Dong released their hands from their respective divine monuments. Qin Shu and Zhou Dong didn’t react in the least even though they knew that Chu Feng had done them a favor by not stealing their divine monuments. They simply walked away as if it was only natural for this to happen.

On the other hand, the white-haired woman turned to Chu Feng and said, “Thanks.”

“There’s no need to be so courteous,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

The white-haired woman walked out of the square as well.

“Those two things don’t know gratitude at all. You shouldn’t have sold them that favor!” Eggy was dissatisfied with Zhou Dong and Qin Shu’s lack of reciprocation.

“It doesn’t matter.” Chu Feng thought nothing about it.

In truth, he wouldn’t have stolen Jia Chengying and Bai Yunqing’s divine monuments if it hadn’t been for their incessant provoking. He wasn’t a saint, but he had his own set of principles that he abided by. He wouldn’t pick on others without any reason.

Boom!

The divine monuments in the square suddenly started trembling once more before simultaneously unleashing rays of light into the sky. These rays of light curved in mid-air and headed in the southwest direction.

After having depleted all of the energy they had absorbed, the divine monuments lost their radiance. 

Bai Yunqing and the others didn’t know what was going on, but the people of the Ancient Realm had expected this to happen. They knew that the energy acquired from the Ancestral Ritual would go to the Ancestral Idol, and the Ancestral Idol was located in the southwest.

A formation appeared in the square, and the divine monuments fell into the formation. Numerous rocks surfaced in return, taking the place of the divine monuments. These were ancestral rocks. 

The square had reverted back to its usual appearance.

Those who had seen the thousand meters tall divine monuments could immediately feel the vast difference between them and the tens of meters tall ancestral rocks. It was only at this moment that the challengers understood how different of a test they had been put through.

“I hereby announce that Miss Bai, young hero Zhou Dong, young hero Qin Shu, young hero Jia Chengying, young hero Bai Yunqing, and young hero Chu Feng have successfully advanced to the next round. Young heroes, I have prepared accommodations for you. Please rest for the day. We’ll begin the subsequent tests tomorrow,” the Ancient Realm’s chief said. 

Several elders stepped forward to bring Chu Feng and the others to their accommodations.

Instead of following his guide, Chu Feng turned to look at Little Crescent. He noticed that Little Crescent had become much more restrained upon arriving in the main city. The other tribes had sidelined her, and her forlorn figure among the crowd looked pitiful. 

“Can I bring her with me?” Chu Feng asked.

“This…” The elder guiding Chu Feng frowned. 

It wouldn’t have mattered for the other tribes, but the Yuan Lineage Tribe was the tribe that the Ancient Realm’s chief hated the most. The Yuan Lineage Tribe would have already disappeared from the Ancient Realm if not for the Ancestral Idol ordering them not to do it. 

“Of course,” the Ancient Realm’s chief suddenly spoke up. He flashed an amicable smile at Chu Feng. “Young hero Chu Feng, have a good rest.”

“Thank you.” Chu Feng clasped his fist at the Ancient Realm’s chief before walking toward Little Crescent. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“C-can I really come with you?” Little Crescent asked. She could feel that the people of this land didn’t welcome her, which deflated her courage. 

“Of course.” Chu Feng grabbed Little Crescent’s hand with a smile.

“You’re a nice person, big brother,” Little Crescent replied with a beaming smile.
