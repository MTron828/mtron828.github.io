Chapter 4142 - Amusement

“Chu Feng, there’s no need for you to do this.”

“Don’t harm them. I guarantee that you’ll be able to leave this place safely,” said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“You should make your decision quickly. Else, both of them will die,” after Chu Feng said those words, the two swords began to draw closer to Zuoqiu Daoyi and Zuoqiu Tiancheng.

Soon, the two swords pierced into their bodies.

Seeing this, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shouted loudly, “Stop!”

“You’ve made your decision?” asked Chu Feng.

At this moment, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Zuoqiu Daoyi.

“Daoyi, father has let you down. But, for the sake of our clan’s future, father has no other choice.”

Hearing those words, Zuoqiu Daoyi immediately started shedding tears like rain.

He was extremely heart-broken.

When the choice was given between him and his younger brother, he did not see the slightest bit of hesitation or conflict in his father’s face.

It seemed like his father had made this decision ahead of time.

His father’s apology had already revealed to him what he had decided.

The person his father wanted to keep alive was his younger brother Zuoqiu Tiancheng, and not him.

“Very well, I understand.”

After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he pulled out both swords from the Zuoqiu brothers and dropped them to the ground.

Many people were confused by his actions.

Didn’t he say that only a single person between Zuoqiu Daoyi and Zuoqiu Tiancheng could live?

Furthermore, he had forced the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to make a decision.

Now that the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had made his decision, why didn’t Chu Feng directly kill Zuoqiu Daoyi, and instead pulled out the Incomplete Exalted Armaments?

At the time when the crowd were confused, Chu Feng took out a bottle gourd from his Cosmos Sack.

Then, he arrived before Zuoqiu Tiancheng and pinched open his mouth with one hand. Using his other hand, he opened the bottle gourd and poured its contents into Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s mouth.

Everyone could see a black bug with yellow hair crawling out from the bottle gourd and entering Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s mouth.

“Eeeahhh~~~”

After the bug crawled into Zuoqiu Tiancheng’s mouth, he immediately began to scream miserably.

Furthermore, he was also vomiting nonstop. He seemed to be trying to throw up the bug.

However, his attempts were futile. He was unable to throw it up.

A change was beginning to appear on his body. His skin had turned black.

Light yellow hair had also grown out from his skin.

His appearance was turning the same as the bug from earlier.

Not only was it terrifying to look at, but it was also very disgusting.

“You bastard! What the hell did you do to me?!”

Zuoqiu Tiancheng realized the change that had occurred to him, and shouted at Chu Feng furiously.

He cared about his physical appearance the most. And now, his appearance had turned like this. It was only natural that he would be terrified that it would be permanent.

“Curb your anger,” said Chu Feng.

“Curb my anger?! You’ve fed me such a disgusting thing, yet you want me to curb my anger?!”

Zuoqiu Tiancheng gnashed his teeth angrily. However, the more he reacted with anger, the more hair began to grow on his body. Furthermore, his screams of pain also grew even more intense.

Soon, he was unable to tolerate the pain, and fell to the ground.

“If you don’t plan to be in such pain, then curb your anger and contain your emotions.”

“Else, you’ll die,” said Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, no matter how unwilling Zuoqiu Tiancheng was, he had no choice but to do as Chu Feng had said.

He could sense the change that had happened in his body. He had also realized that Chu Feng was not joking around.

If he refused to comply with Chu Feng, he would really die.

To his enormous surprise, after he contained his anger, the pain not only weakened, but the hair that grew out from his body also began to pull back.

Seeing this, Zuoqiu Tiancheng continued to adjust his emotions.

Just like this, his circumstances continued to improve. Not only had all the pain disappeared, but even his body had returned to normal.

“This...”

“Chu Feng, exactly what have you done to me?” asked Zuoqiu Daoyi.

“Don’t worry. What I fed you was a gu poison I made.”

“I spent all last night preparing it.”

“This gu poison will not kill you, and it will also not torture you.”

“As long as you do not get angry or think about malicious things, you’ll be fine.”

“However, there’s another condition.”

“That is, your life is now in my control. If I want you dead, you will definitely die,” said Chu Feng.

“You!”

Hearing those words, the crowd all realized what was going on.

Chu Feng had fed that thing to Zuoqiu Tiancheng so that he could use his life to threaten the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan. Through that, he would be able to ensure his own safety.

“That said, I had no idea your older brother would also enter this place.”

“Because of that, I’d only prepared a single gu poison. Since your father is most concerned for your safety, the gu poison would naturally have to be used on you. You should thank your good father,” said Chu Feng.

Hearing those words, Zuoqiu Tiancheng was so enraged he nearly vomited blood.

He never imagined that the concern his father had for him would court such a disaster.

He was not the only one who was furious. The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was also gnashing his teeth furiously.

He knew very well that his decision earlier had hurt Zuoqiu Daoyi’s heart.

Chu Feng had not only poisoned his son, but he had also set him up.

“Chu Feng, you’re actually intending to use a gu poison to threaten me?”

“Originally, I had no intention of killing you. However, what you’ve done is touching my baseline.”

“Remove the poison from my son’s body at once. Else, I will take your life,” said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

“Threatening me?”

Chu Feng smiled with a look of disapproval.

“Buzz~~~”

Boundless oppressive might suddenly soared out from the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

His oppressive might had taken a visible form.

His boundless oppressive might actually covered the entire Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation and sealed it off.

“Chu Feng, don’t you think about leaving here today!”

“Unless you are to remove the poison, I will have your entire family, your entire clan, perish with you!” the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shouted furiously.

He was truly enraged by Chu Feng.

After all, he had been played by him just then. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Heh...”

“Is that so? But, I’m afraid you won’t have the opportunity to kill me.”

“Remember my words. Conduct yourself well, else... you will definitely not be able to keep your son alive.”

As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a paper talisman. Then, light surged on his body. The light soon engulfed his entire body.

The next instant after the light engulfed his body, it disappeared.

After the light disappeared, the surrounding people were all baffled.

The reason for that was because Chu Feng had disappeared along with the light.

“Where’d he go?”

“Grandpa Bu, where’s that Chu Feng?”

“Did he conceal himself?”

Even the girl from the Dragon Clan had a look of confusion.

“He teleported away. He used a very powerful teleportation talisman,” said the old man from the Dragon Clan.

“Teleportation talisman?”

“But, didn’t the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief use his oppressive might to seal the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation?”

“How powerful of a teleportation formation must that be?” The girl from the Dragon Clan was extremely shocked.
