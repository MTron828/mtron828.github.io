MGA: Chapter 1632-2 - Ruthlessness [1. Bee mislabeled the chapter number.]

“Lord Clan Chief, I saw everything that happened earlier. However, might that be a misunderstanding? Could it be a misperception? You must know that Chu Feng is merely a rank nine Martial King. It is simply impossible for him to become a threat to our Nangong Imperial Clan.”

“Furthermore, Chu Feng braved dangers for the sake of helping us. Moreover, he has come to our Nangong Imperial Clan to stay as a guest. Even if he possesses heaven-defying potential, it would only be a benefit to our Nangong Imperial Clan.”

“After all, even if he becomes extremely powerful in the future, with his relationship with Nangong Ya, Baihe and Moli, he will definitely stand on the side of our Nangong Imperial Clan,” Seeing that what she had said earlier had proven to be effective, Aunt Lian hurriedly added some soft words into the mix. She was thinking up every possible method to have Nangong Beidou let Chu Feng off.

“Are you certain that Chu Feng possesses upright behavior, and will not attack our Nangong Imperial Clan if he is to become powerful in the future?” Nangong Beidou asked. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Even though I have not known him for long, I have experienced a lot with him. During the moment of life and death crisis, Chu Feng was willing to give his life for righteousness. For his friends, he was willing to sacrifice himself.”

“I believe that he is someone that can be trusted. I am certain that if Chu Feng is to become powerful in the future, he will definitely not become our Nangong Imperial Clan’s enemy. Instead, he will help our Nangong Imperial Clan,” Aunt Lian vowed.

“Since sis Lian vouches for him to this extent, I will look no further into this matter. You can return,” Nangong Beidou said.

“Yes,” Aunt Lian prepared to leave.

Suddenly, Nangong Beidou added, “Oh, that’s right. Those who have come are guests. Have Chu Feng stay for some more days and not rush to leave.”

Hearing those words, Aunt Lian started to frown. However, she didn’t say anything and left.

After Aunt Lian left, that Nangong Huayi and Nangong Rongsheng immediately said, “Lord Clan Chief, that child absolutely cannot be left alive.”

“Why do you two say that?” Nangong Beidou asked.

“Today, that child had disagreements with the four Princes and the Princess. I fear that he already holds a grudge against them.”

“If he is to be left alive, I fear that he will definitely oppose our Nangong Imperial Clan in the future. We cannot release a tiger back into the mountain,” Nangong Huayi said.

“Such a thing actually happened?” Nangong Beidou did not expect for this many things to have happened in a single day.

“This is absolutely true. This subordinate would not dare to deceive Lord Clan Chief,” Nangong Huayi said.

“Brother White-brow, what do you think about this matter?” Nangong Beidou asked.

“That child’s Divine Body is truly extraordinary. We cannot even be certain as to whether his power is actually that of a Divine Power or not. Essentially, he is extremely special.”

“However, this does not mean that he will really possess outstanding strength. It might also be false bravado. I think we should have a test,” White-browed Immortal said.

“Test? How do we test?” Nangong Beidou asked.

“Clan Chief Nangong, didn’t you just receive one of five long-lost Secret Skills, the Water Immortal Profound Technique?”

“After all, you planned to teach the princes and princess the Water Immortal Profound Technique. Why not teach them today?”

“At the time when you begin to teach them the Water Immortal Profound Technique, call that Chu Feng over too,” White-browed Immortal said.

“You’re saying we should use the Water Immortal Profound Technique to test Chu Feng’s potential?” Nangong Beidou realized White-browed Immortal’s intention.

“That’s right. The Water Immortal Profound Technique is one of the Holy Land of Martialism’s five strongest Secret Skills. Naturally, it will choose the strongest individual as its master. After all, in all of history, all of its masters were extraordinary existences.”

“Tomorrow, have Chu Feng, the three Princes and the Princess meet the Water Immortal Profound Technique together. If the Water Immortal Profound Technique chooses any of the Princes or the Princess, it will mean that Chu Feng is not someone to be feared, that all he has revealed is nothing more than false bravado. At that time, there will be no harm in sparing his life.”

“However, if the Water Immortal Profound Technique chooses Chu Feng, it will mean that that child possesses extremely powerful potential. No matter what, you cannot let him leave. You must eliminate him regardless of the price,” White-browed Immortal said.

“That is indeed a brilliant method,” Nangong Beidou started to nod after hearing what White-browed Immortal suggested.

“However, Immortal, if that Water Immortal Profound Technique were to choose Chu Feng, wouldn’t we have wasted such an amazing Secret Skill in vain? After all, Lord Clan Chief has spent an enormous effort and paid considerably in order to obtain that Secret Skill,” Nangong Huayi was hesitant.

“Haha, you are overthinking it. If the Water Immortal Profound Technique were to truly choose Chu Feng, Chu Feng’s death would be inevitable. As long as Chu Feng is killed, the Water Immortal Profound Technique will regain its freedom. As such, how could it be a waste?” White-browed Immortal laughed out loud. A trace of ruthlessness appeared between his eyebrows.

“Very well, it’s decided. Huayi, Rongsheng, you two go and make the arrangements.”

“However, this matter must not be limited to Chu Feng and my children. Tomorrow, bring your children, as well as all of our Nangong Imperial Clan’s excellent younger generation over. We can take this opportunity to have the Water Immortal Profound Technique test whether there is anyone in our Nangong Imperial Clan with even stronger talent than my children. If there is, we must definitely nurture them.”

“After all, if our Nangong Imperial Clan is to become more powerful, I cannot only nurture my own children. Instead, I must consider the bigger picture,” Nangong Beidou said.

“Clan Chief Nangong is truly highly principled,” White-browed Immortal and the others began to flatter Nangong Beidou.

......

Chu Feng did not know about the discussion between Nangong Beidou and the others. At this moment, the six enormous lightning beasts had returned to his body.

Chu Feng’s aura had become that of a rank one Half Martial Emperor.

However, Chu Feng was unable to feel happiness. That was because he knew that he had caused an enormous disaster for himself. Even though he was within his room, he had seen all that had happened outside with his Heaven’s Eyes.

The overbearing enormous black lightning beast, although it had not attacked the golden dragon directly,had caused the Nangong Imperial Clan’s golden dragon to flee in fear with a single roar.

If that were all there were to it, it would still have been tolerable. However, most importantly, Chu Feng had seen the facial appearances of the Nangong Imperial Clansmen when all this was happening. They were all deeply frightened. Evidently, once they knew that it was Chu Feng who had done all this, they would definitely consider him a threat.

“Chu Feng, should we escape now?” Eggy asked.

“We will not be able to escape,” Chu Feng said.

“Let’s go find that Nangong Lian. She brought you here, she should be able to bring you out,” Eggy said.

“At this time, Aunt Lian should have been called over and received questioning,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Even though he did not see that happening, he was able to guess what had happened.

“Then what do we do? Must you sit and wait for death here?” Eggy asked.

“It will all depend on whether the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief is a wise and sensible individual or not. If he possesses a broad mind, he will definitely not make things difficult for me, a mere member of the younger generation.”

“However, if he is a narrow-minded individual, he will definitely make me suffer a calamity. However, that is also good. This will be an opportunity for me to see what sort of person the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief is.”

“However, they likely do not know that even though I, Chu Feng, am a member of the younger generation, I am not a pushover. I am not someone that they can pinch as they wish,” Chu Feng smiled lightly.

“It seems like you’re planning to release that guy in this Nangong Imperial Clan? If you are to release it, it will be fine if you are able to successfully control it. However, if you fail to do so, the Nangong Imperial Clan will suffer a major calamity,” Eggy said.

“If they are heartless, I, Chu Feng, will be heartless too,” As Chu Feng said these words, a flash of ruthlessness shone through his eyes.
