Chapter 3782 - The Past

“Senior, allow this junior to down this cup of wine as a show of respect." Chu Feng raised his cup of wine and drained it in one gulp.

“Are you not afraid that I might place another curse on you?” Old Freak Tang asked with a strange smile.

“If senior wished to kill me, this junior would not be able to live." said Chu Feng.

“What do you think of my daughter?” asked Old Freak Tang.

“Ah?” Chu Feng was startled to hear those words.

Then, he asked, “Senior, you know what I’ve done?”

“Mn, I saw everything that happened inside the remnant.” Old Freak Tang said with a smile..

Hearing those words, Chu Feng came to the realization that Old Freak Tang was actually secretly tailing him whilst he was secretly tailing Song Ge.

Chu Feng laughed in embarrassment. He had not managed to detect Old Freak Tang secretly following him at all.

That said, it was understandable too. If someone of Old Freak Tang’s cultivation wanted to tail Chu Feng, even if Chu Feng were a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he would still not be able to detect him. After all, Old Freak Tang was an Utmost Exalted.

The reason why Chu Feng was able to successfully tail Old Freak Tang the first time around was because he had been careless.

As matters stood, Chu Feng already knew why Old Freak Tang would prepare a meal for him.

He had already guessed that he would seek him out.

“Since senior already knows, this junior will not beat around the bush.”

“Senior, your daughter misses you greatly. She wants to see you. Why are you unwilling to meet her?” asked Chu Feng.

“It’s not that I don’t want to meet her. It’s simply that I am too ashamed to meet her.”

Old Freak Tang drank his cup of wine and revealed an ashamed look.

Then, he began to tell Chu Feng what had happened in the past.

Back then, Old Freak Tang was an all-powerful individual in the All-heaven Starfield. Later on, he became disgusted with the mutual deception martial cultivators lived in, and decided to live as a commoner.

He decided to return to his hometown, Autumnfall Village.

Although he had decided to return to his hometown to live as a commoner, Old Freak Tang was accustomed to living alone after being in the martial cultivation world for many years. Because of that, he was very wary against others.

Because of that, even though he had returned to Autumnfall Village for many years, he was not familiar with the villagers. Furthermore, as he had a strange temperament, no one was willing to befriend him either.

Getting together with Song Ge’s mother was purely an accident.

Old Freak Tang actually did not like Song Ge’s mother. He had merely lost control of himself back then.

After Old Freak Tang learned that Song Ge’s mother was pregnant with a child, he had originally wanted to snatch the child away.

Old Freak Tang did not wish to have any burdens. He did not want a wife, much less children. He only wanted to be alone. He did not seek comfort and ease, but to be unrestrained.

However, Song Ge’s mother threatened Old Freak Tang with her life. She declared that she would kill herself should he take away the child.

Originally, Old Freak Tang did not care about the life and death of Song Ge’s mother. However, for some unknown reason, he was very worried about her mother killing herself at that time.

Feeling helpless, Old Freak Tang reached terms with Song Ge’s mother, and allowed her to give birth to the child.

However, he told her that she was not allowed to tell anyone that the child was his. Otherwise, he would personally kill both her and Song Ge.

Song Ge’s mother really ended up not telling anyone about Old Freak Tang.

A woman who was single for over a thousand years had actually borne a child. Furthermore, no one knew who the father of the child was.

Unavoidably, countless malicious rumors began to form. The people of the village all began to roll their eyes at Song Ge’s mother.

One could very well imagine how difficult things were for her back then. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Had it been someone else, they would most likely have chosen to leave and settle anew somewhere else after all the rumors and slander.

However, Song Ge’s mother insisted on bearing everything to continue staying in the village.

Of course, as Song Ge grew older and her talent gradually revealed itself, no one dared to bully her and her mother anymore.

Instead, they all began trying to gain a connection with Song Ge’s mother.

Moreover, Song Ge was a very filial child. Thus, Song Ge’s mother’s later years were rather good.

That said, Song Ge’s mother had never said another word to Old Freak Tang. She hated him bitterly.

She didn’t know that the heartless Old Freak Tang from back then had changed after Song Ge was born.

In the end, Song Ge was Old Freak Tang’s daughter, someone who he had a blood relationship with.

Originally, Old Freak Tang thought that he would never be fond of children, including his own children.

However, as he saw Song Ge growing up day by day, his affection for her started to slowly germinate unbeknownst to him. By the time he realized his affection for his child, it was already too late for him to break free from his emotions.

Old Freak Tang began to pay close attention to Song Ge. He was afraid that she would be bullied by others. In fact, he even went as far to secretly aid and protect her.

Merely, he never revealed himself to her. He felt that he was not qualified to do so.

After all, if her mother hadn’t threatened him with her life, Song Ge would’ve been killed by Old Freak Tang before she was even born.

Thus, even though Old Freak Tang deeply wanted to reveal to Song Ge that he was her father, he did not dare to do so.

At the same time, he felt that he was unqualified to let her know that he was her father.

“Senior, you need to know that Song Ge actually also wants to meet you.”

“Are you planning to have her not know who her father is for the rest of her life?” Chu Feng asked after learning what had happened.

“Let me think about it. me” Old Freak Tang forced a smile and shook his head. His eyes were brimming with helplessness and sadness.

“Cough, cough, cough...”

Suddenly, Old Freak Tang started to cough violently. His coughing session this time around was much more intense than before. His entire body started to wobble violently.

Even though he had covered his mouth with his hand, Chu Feng was still able to see a vast amount of blood flowing out from between his fingers.

The blood was actually black.

After the black blood was coughed out, Old Freak Tang immediately aged a lot, and his health became especially weak.

He looked like someone on the verge of dying, and was unable to even sit stably.

“Senior, you...”

Seeing Old Freak Tang like that, Chu Feng started feeling slightly sad.

Chu Feng was able to tell that Old Freak Tang would not be able to live for much longer. He might die in the coming days.

“Chu Feng, in two days, bring Song Ge to the Void Cleanse Monastery’s Fate-changing Bell and wait for me.” said Old Freak Tang.

Chu Feng had wanted to alleviate Old Freak Tang’s condition. However, he was refused.

Old Freak Tang told Chu Feng to directly seek out his daughter, Song Ge.

Chu Feng suspected that Old Freak Tang was worried for her. Apart from monitoring her mother, Old Freak Tang had been monitoring and protecting her as well.

And now, his illness had grown more serious. It had made him unable to secretly protect her. Because of that, he wanted Chu Feng to protect Song Ge on his behalf.

However, Old Freak Tang was still Old Freak Tang. Although that was what was on his mind, he did not explicitly say so to Chu Feng.

Knowing what Old Freak Tang really wanted him to do, Chu Feng decided to comply with his request to seek out Song Ge.
