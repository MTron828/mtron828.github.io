Chapter 5276: Sealing Off the Realm

“What’s the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant?” Long Xiaoxiao hadn’t heard of it before.

Chu Feng told Long Xiaoxiao about the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant via voice transmission.

“Ah! I didn’t know that this remnant is that formidable. That explains why I received such a huge bundle of energy.”

Long Xiaoxiao was delighted to hear about the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant’s reputation.

“But if I have received the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant’s legacy, it doesn’t make sense why we are still wandering around, unable to find a clue at all,” Long Xiaoxiao said after a moment of thought.

“Xiaoxiao, try to connect with the energy inside your body and see if it resonates with the remnant.”

Chu Feng figured that if Long Xiaoxiao had acquired the remnant’s legacy, she might just be able to communicate with the remnant through it.

“All right.”

Long Xiaoxiao did as she was told. A moment later, she shook her head, indicating that she couldn’t sense anything at all.

Just then, a person walked toward them. It was the monk, Liu Kuo.

“Ey, I couldn’t find any clues at all. There’s nothing good in here. Why were we teleported here in the first place? What in the world is the Totem Dragon Clan up to?” Liu Kuo berated.

While Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao were chatting via voice transmission, he combed the forest several times but was unable to find anything at all.

Weng!

Chu Feng suddenly sensed something. He quickly raised his head to look at the sky. The white-haired woman and Liu Kuo did the same too. Long Xiaoxiao belatedly noticed their actions and did the same too, but she couldn’t understand what they were looking at.

“It’s changed,” Chu Feng and Liu Kuo said simultaneously.

“What changed?” Long Xiaoxiao still didn’t get it. She didn’t notice any difference in the sky at all.

“Little sister Long, the sky we were seeing earlier was the manifestation of a formation. It looks identical to the real sky, but it’s nothing more than an imitation. However, the formation around us has just turned transparent, allowing us to see the real sky,” Liu Kuo said.

“What’s the significance of this change?” Long Xiaoxiao asked.

“There must be a reason behind it. Allow me, Liu Kuo, to take a closer look and uncover the mystery.”

Liu Kuo’s eyes suddenly changed in color. Two beams could be seen shooting out from his eyes toward the sky. It was an observation skill.

Moments later, he closed his eyes with a pained look on his face.

“It was a miscalculation. There’s nothing there at all. What is up with this remnant? Is it toying with us?”

The earlier observation skill seemed to have taken a toll on Liu Kuo, which put him in a bad mood.

“What do you think, Chu Feng?” Long Xiaoxiao asked.

Chu Feng had also been staring at the sky with his Heaven’s Eye, but he couldn’t find anything either.

“Such a change wouldn’t happen without a reason. It might be possible that something is going to happen outside, and the remnant wants us to see it,” Chu Feng theorized.

“Something is going to happen outside?” Liu Kuo asked.

“Have you heard of the demon monk?” Chu Feng asked.

“Demon monk?”

Both Liu Kuo and Long Xiaoxiao’s eyes narrowed. Both of them seemed to have heard about the demon monk.

“I know him. My final opponent was an old man who proclaimed himself to be a disciple of the demon monk. He demanded that I hand the title of the strongest to him, but I knocked him out with a punch,” Liu Kuo said.

“It’s the same for me too. My final opponent was a junior, but he said that he was the demon monk’s disciple too. He claimed that his master would massacre everyone here, but I thought that he was lying and knocked him out,” Long Xiaoxiao said.

Chu Feng glanced at the white-haired woman, but the latter continued to cultivate with closed eyes. Nevertheless, he could already guess what was going on.

“The demon monk probably dispatched his four disciples to compete for the title of the strongest in all four categories,” Chu Feng said with a sigh.

“Does the demon monk really exist?” Long Xiaoxiao asked.

“Most likely so. My guess is that the demon monk will make a move soon,” Chu Feng said.

Long Xiaoxiao hurriedly raised her head to look at the sky too.

“We’ll be watching a show? I ought to make some preparations then.”

Liu Kuo placed a mat over the ground and made himself comfortable on it. He then took out a box filled with all kinds of delicacies, along with four sets of bowls and utensils.

“Brother Chu Feng and little sister Long, join me!” Liu Kuo beckoned them over.

“…” Long Xiaoxiao was speechless.

If the demon monk’s disciples weren’t lying about their master’s strength, a catastrophe would soon befall them. Yet, Liu Kuo was acting casually as if he was just watching a play.

What left her even more speechless was that Chu Feng actually walked over and sat down on the mat too.

“Brother Liu, I shan’t freeload on your food. I have fine wine with me.”

Chu Feng took out several wine gourds filled with the Qian Clan Tavern’s finest wine. He had stolen these wine gourds from the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s elders back then.

“Brother Chu Feng, I take my food and wine very seriously. I have drunk the finest wine in the world of cultivation, and I reckon the fine wine that you have brought might just be so-so in my eyes. Why don’t you try mine instead?”

Liu Kuo took out a wine vat and poured its content out into a bowl.

Chu Feng ignored Liu Kuo and went ahead to uncork one of the wine gourds.

Liu Kuo was about to gulp down the bowl of wine when his movements suddenly halted. His eyes drifted over to the wine gourd in Chu Feng’s hand, and he gulped down his saliva.

“What fragrant wine you have there! Brother Chu Feng, I was wrong. Please let me have a taste of your wine!” Liu Kuo pleaded.

“Here, Brother Liu.” Chu Feng poured out the wine into a bowl and passed it over.

Liu Kuo gulped down the wine.

“Gah! Marvelous! Brother Chu Feng, what wine is this?” Liu Kuo asked.

“I got it from Qian Clan Tavern,” Chu Feng replied.

“Ah, Qian Clan Tavern. I have long heard about them, but I have never gotten a chance to pay them a visit. Who could have thought that I would get my first taste of their wine here? Their wine truly lives up to their reputation!” Liu Kuo laughed heartily as he passed the empty bowl back to Chu Feng.

Catching his drift, Chu Feng served him another bowl of wine.

Just then, a fair hand suddenly appeared with a jade bowl in hand.

“Little sister Long, this wine is pretty potent. You might get drunk. Are you sure you’re up for it?” Liu Kuo asked.

Chu Feng quietly poured out a bowl for Long Xiaoxiao too.

“Who says that a woman can’t drink?” Long Xiaoxiao scoffed before gracefully taking a sip of the wine. It was clear from her mannerism that she knew how to take alcohol.

“Wonderful! Hahaha! I didn’t think that someone as dainty as our little sister Long would be such a candid person!” Liu Kuo complimented.

Chu Feng also poured himself a bowl of wine too.

“It is fate that we crossed paths in this vast world. Cheers to that!” Chu Feng raised his bowl.

“Cheers!” Long Xiaoxiao clanged her bowl against Chu Feng’s with a sweet smile.

“Indeed, indeed! There are countless cultivators in the world, but how many of them are able to hit it off? It’s my honor to be able to befriend the two of you today.” Liu Kuo raised his wine bowl and laughed heartily.

Meanwhile, the white-haired woman continued cultivating.

…

In the late Martial Exalted level field, the crowd was staring at the firmly-closed tower with uncomprehending looks. They couldn’t understand how the duel was still ongoing even after so much time had passed.

The little monk named Wang Luan was already out of danger. Instead of looking at the tower like the others, he turned his sight toward the sky. He had also sensed the changes in the sky. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At the same time, Long Junlin and the others were carefully examining the floating sphere that was intricately linked with the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant, whereas the other Totem Dragon Clansmen were eyeing the formation.

None of them had noticed any anomaly.

Boom!

An intense tremor suddenly quaked the entire area. Everyone in the vicinity, whether they were inside the trial or outside, was able to clearly feel it, and they immediately turned their eyes to the sky.

An immense bundle of black aura appeared on the horizon, looming above the crowd like a giant eyeball. Those who met eyes with it felt chills running down their spine.

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Innumerable massive black chains spanning widths exceeding ten thousand meters shot out from the black aura, darting in all directions as if it was going to besiege a fortress. It took a mere split second for them to envelope the entire sky.

Then, the massive black chains began to fall upon the earth.

Boom boom boom boom boom!

The earth tremored as the chains pierced through the ground. They formed a huge cage that imprisoned the billions of cultivators gathered in the area.

“This is bad!”

In the sky, Mo Yuhan’s grandfather and Long Xiaoxiao’s master frowned. They could already tell that they were trapped while the others were still struggling to comprehend the situation.

Shoosh!

The black aura in the sky continued expanding at a shocking rate as more and more black chains shot out of it at an increasing rate. However, this new wave of black chains didn’t fall onto the earth but instead darted in random directions.

“They’re planning to seal off the entire realm!” Ningyu Shangren exclaimed.

“What powerful means! What are they up to? Are they trying to thwart the Trial of the Strongest?” Mo Chengzhou asked.

“They are probably after the Totem Dragon Clan,” Ningyu Shangren said.

“Will my Yuhan and your Xiaoxiao be implicated as well?” Mo Chengzhou asked worriedly.

“Most likely. Given the scale of the attack, there’s no way they can steer clear of this conflict,” Ningyu Shangren said.

“We’ll have to make a move then,” Mo Chengzhou said.

“Let’s wait and see first. The enemy might be formidable, but the Totem Dragon Clan is no pushover either,” Ningyu Shangren said.

While the experts were able to maintain their composure, the other cultivators were scared out of their wits. To them, it looked like the realm had been sealed off by the black chains. They had never seen anything of this scale before.

“What’s going on? I’m starting to feel uneasy.”

Even those in the trial were panicking too. The change in the formation allowed them to see the happenings outside. It was the same for Chu Feng and the others too.

“Is that the demon monk? What a spectacular entrance this is. Brother Chu Feng, it looks like we’ll have a great show,” Liu Kuo said excitedly.

On the other hand, Chu Feng’s expression turned grim. He could feel that the tremendous power that had gathered in the sky was far beyond their means to deal with.

In other words, all of them would be goners if the Totem Dragon Clan failed to stop this calamity.
