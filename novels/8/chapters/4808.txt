Chapter 4808: Settle Our Scores

“You’re Zuoqiu Youyu, the previous Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple?”

Unexpectedly, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple’s voice sounded a little old.

Tzlala!

Zuoqiu Youyu didn’t say a word. Instead, lightning began emerging on his body, and he swiftly channeled it onto his Exalted Armament.

Upon seeing how powerful his opponent was, he knew he had to go all out. So, he resorted to executing an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

Shoosh!

The lightning suddenly dissipated.

Before Chu Feng could even process it, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple had risen from the ground, and his punch had already sunk right into Zuoqiu Youyu’s abdomen.

Zuoqiu Youyu was stunned for a moment before hurriedly retreating several steps back. The punch had dealt significant damage to him, but he endured the pain and forced himself to remain standing.

In the end, his knees still ended up caving him, and he fell onto the ground.

“This...”

This was beyond the crowd’s expectations. Was the duel going to end just like that?

The crowd hadn’t even gotten an opportunity to determine what cultivation level the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was at! The latter hadn’t even emanated his oppressive might yet, but he was already able to defeat Zuoqiu Youyu?

Was this really over?

Indignation was written all over Zuoqiu Youyu’s face. He wasn’t willing to let it all end just like this. He struggled with all his might, hoping to get back to his feet, but his body wouldn’t listen to his command. The crowd could tell that he was already trying his best, but he didn’t have the strength to even stand up.

“You’re too weak. Scram aside.”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple walked to Zuoqiu Youyu’s side and swept him to the corner of the combat ring with a wave of his sleeves. This sight shocked the crowd.

The current generation of juniors was dubbed as the most talented one in the history of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and Zuoqiu Youyu was known to be the strongest disciple. For this reason, he had been standing tall and mighty before the others.

Yet, he was treated in such a way by the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.

This shocking disparity drove in how terrifying the prowess of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was.

“Next.”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple swept through the crowd with his gaze as he spoke. It was just that his question was met with complete silence.

All of those who had left their names on the board weren’t saying a word at all.

“Is there no other challengers? If so, I’ll be heading back to rest,” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple stretched his back as he spoke. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was only normal that no one dared to step forward. With even Zuoqiu Youyu suffering such a thorough defeat, who would possibly step ahead to make themselves suffer.

Everyone thought that the matchmaking convention was already over. It had only started a moment ago, but this was already enough shock for the day.

They had known that the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple couldn’t possibly be weak, but no one thought that his strength would be so great that Zuoqiu Youyu didn’t even stand a chance at all.

“I’ll challenge you!”

But all of a sudden, Chu Feng stood up.

“Chu Feng, don’t force yourself!” Xia Yan tried to stop him.

It wasn’t just Xia Yan. Many people were sending voice transmissions to him, telling him not to be reckless, including the chief elder, Li Muzhi, and the others.

It would be understandable if Chu Feng challenged the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple without knowing the latter’s true strength, but it was clear as day right now that Chu Feng was no match for the latter. It was simply unwise to take this fight.

However, Chu Feng couldn’t bring himself to give up here. He couldn’t bear to watch Zi Ling getting betrothed to another man. Even if it was praying for a miracle, he had to give it a try.

He began making his way toward the combat ring. The forbidden medicine was already hidden in his mouth, and he was ready to consume it as soon as the battle began.

“Wait a moment, you wish to challenge me?” the Hidden Dragon Chief Elder assessed Chu Feng intently as he asked.

“That’s right. I am Chu Feng, and I wish to challenge you to a duel,” Chu Feng replied.

“There’s no need for it. I’ll hand the position of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple to you,” the other party replied.

“Ah?”

This immediately stirred a huge commotion. Putting aside the bystanders, even Chu Feng didn’t dare to believe what he was hearing. The other party was going to give him the position of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple without even battling him?

How could there be such a good thing in the world?

“You don’t intend to fight me?”

Chu Feng was uncertain whether he was hearing things.

“I don’t want to fight you. You can have the position of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple for yourself,” the other party emphasized.

Whoosh!

Many voices immediately exploded from the spectator stand. Even though they were in the presence of the sectmaster, they couldn’t hold themselves back anymore.

This was too shocking! They couldn’t comprehend what was going on at all.

Could it be that Chu Feng knew the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple? Or was it that the latter didn’t like Zi Ling and didn’t wish to get betrothed to her?

Was she really handing the position of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple to Chu Feng just like that? But was Chu Feng even worthy of this position?

Taking a step back, would Zuoqiu Youyu accept this decision?

“Hahaha! Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple? Is he even qualified?”

As expected, Zuoqiu Youyu immediately voiced his opposition. Despite the injury he had sustained earlier, he was able to recover a fair bit after some rest. At the very least, he was able to speak properly now.

Even if the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was willing to pass down his position to Chu Feng, there was no way Zuoqiu Youyu would accept such an outcome.

“What did you say?”

But as soon as Zuoqiu Youyu spoke up, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple turned his gaze toward him and began walking over. A hint of fear appeared in the latter’s eyes.

Zuoqiu Youyu was afraid. He had never feared anything or anyone, but he was feeling fear at this very moment.

“The position of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple ought to be bestowed upon the qualified. Junior Zi Ling ought to be betrothed to someone worthy of her. I believe that this is the reason why the sectmaster organized this matchmaking convention. You shouldn’t pass your position as the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple to such a weakling.”

Out of fear, Zuoqiu Youyu actually started explaining himself. However, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple couldn’t care less about it.

“What crap are you speaking over there? I am the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. What business of yours is it if I want to pass down my position to him? Do you have a problem with my decision? If so, I’ll have no choice but to beat you into submission then!”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple grabbed Zuoqiu Youyu’s collar and pulled him up from the ground.

At this very moment, everyone could sense just how despaired Zuoqiu Youyu was. When had he ever been treated in such a way before?

“I’m asking you a question here! Are you deaf or mute? Speak!” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple bellowed.

Zuoqiu Youyu dared not to face the latter. He muttered softly, “I have no objections...”

He actually compromised!

While it was within expectations, the crowd still found this sight unbelievable. Today, Zuoqiu Youyu’s dignity had really been utterly crushed by the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.

“That’s good.”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple nodded in satisfaction before finally releasing his grip on Zuoqiu Youyu’s collar. But without any warning, he suddenly clenched his hand into fist and slammed it into Zuoqiu Youyu’s abdomen.

It was an even heavier strike than before.

Zuoqiu Youyu spurted a huge gush of blood as he collapsed to the ground. Even the excrement from his stomach also began spilling out, giving rise to a gruesome sight.

Of course, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple moved in time to dodge the mess. His speed was ridiculously fast.

“Your battle has ended, and he has come to a compromise too. Is there a need for you to attack him once more?”

The vice sectmaster finally couldn’t stand it anymore and questioned the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. However, even though he was standing before the vice sectmaster, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple showed no fear and smiled disdainfully.

“He did compromise, but it’s a fact that he questioned me earlier too. Does compromising justify his act of questioning me earlier? Insolence ought to be punished, don’t you think so? Oh, I nearly forgot. This trash is your grandson, right? My apologies. He might be a precious grandson to you, but I have no intention of tolerating any bullshit from him.”

The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple grabbed Zuoqiu Youyu by his hair and lifted him up once more.

“Listen well. I don’t know how you have been all this while, but you better not try to pull anything before him. If you dare to talk such crap to me once more, I’ll rip off your mouth and sever your tongue!”

Then, he tossed Zuoqiu Youyu violently against the walls of the combat ring.

Before him, the lofty Zuoqiu Youyu was no more than an ant.

Afterward, he walked out of the combat ring and headed in Chu Feng’s direction. Where he passed by, the crowd instinctively cowered in fear.

It was one thing while he was still in the combat ring, but as soon as he walked out, the crowd’s fear toward him intensified.

“Congratulations, Chu Feng. You get to walk away with a beautiful spouse,” the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said.

Chu Feng was thankful to the latter. While he had no idea why the other party would help him, he was still grateful to him for fulfilling him and Zi Ling.

But before he could say a word, a voice transmission reached his ears.

“Chu Feng, we have plenty of time ahead of us. Let’s slowly settle the scores between us.”

It was from the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple!
