Chapter 3855 - Astonishing Action

Nangong Yifan was lying on the ground, looking quite miserable.

Astonishment filled his eyes. That could be seen from how they were flickering. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As the strongest younger generation of the All-heaven Sect, the strongest genius of the All-heaven Starfield, Nangong Yifan had always been able to get whatever he wanted in the All-heaven Starfield.

Even the people of the older generation had to act respectfully toward him. As for the people of the younger generation, they simply acted like they were seeing a god when they saw him.

Yet, at that moment, not only was he lying on the ground in a sorry state, but the person that had injured him was actually a person of the younger generation as well.

However, that was not what was important. What was important was that... that person of the younger generation actually dared to attack him???

Yet, it just so happened that he had been attacked by a person of the younger generation. Not only that, but the attack had landed on him, and he was beaten to a sorry state of lying on the ground.

After a brief moment of shock, Nangong Yifan shouted furiously, “Bastard! Do you know who I am?! You dare to attack me?!”

His furious roar resounded everywhere, and even caused space to tremble. In fact, his voice had even extended out from the enormous island.

Nangong Yifan was truly furious.

“Attack you?”

“Is that very hard to believe?”

Chu Feng smiled indifferently. Then, he extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. Nangong Yifan, who was lying on the ground thousands of meters away, immediately stood up, started floating in midair and then began to rapidly fly towards Chu Feng.

Nangong Yifan was being affected by an attractive force. Chu Feng was forcibly sucking him towards him.

After Nangong Yifan was brought over to Chu Feng, Chu Feng waved his hand.

“Paa!” Nangong Yifan was once again sent flying.

After Nangong Yifan landed, he rolled several times on the ground before finally stabilizing himself.

After Nangong Yifan stabilized himself, Yin Zhuanghong’s heart tensed up, and panic appeared on her face.

Nangong Yifan had already appeared very miserable lying on the ground.

However, there was now a bloody handprint imprinted on his cheek.

It was Chu Feng. Earlier, Chu Feng had sent Nangong Yifan flying with a slap to the face.

That slap caused Nangong Yifan to bleed profusely from both his nose and his mouth.

Not only was half of his face covered by the bloody hand-print, but it was also rapidly swelling.

Originally handsome, Nangong Yifan’s face had been deformed by the slap.

“You damned bastard! You’re courting death! You’re fucking courting death!”

“I’ll rip you to shreds!!!”

Nangong Yifan shouted once more. This time, he unleashed a great amount of killing intent.

However, even though Nangong Yifan was furious, he was unable to stand up. In fact, he was unable to even unleash his oppressive might or power. As for attacking Chu Feng, it was even more impossible.

It was like Nangong Yifan had lost his cultivation.

Nangong Yifan felt extremely confused by what was happening. At the same time, he felt very unreconciled and furious.

Seeing the enormously furious yet puzzled Nangong Yifan, a mocking smile appeared on Chu Feng’s face.

“I’ve heard that you’re the number one genius of the All-heaven Starfield?”

“The number one genius of the All-heaven Starfield is actually trash like you?”

“I can only say that this All-heaven Starfield is truly too disappointing." mocked Chu Feng.

Chu Feng knew very well why Nangong Yifan was unable to unleash his power.

After all, his power had been sealed away by Chu Feng.

Ordinary Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists were able to possess a battle power on par with rank five Exalted.

Chu Feng, by relying on the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, possessed a battle power on par with rank six Exalted.

Such a battle power was extremely powerful. Even without using any martial power, Chu Feng was still an existence that Nangong Yifan could not defeat.

By relying on his superb attainments in the utilization of world spirit techniques, Chu Feng was able to make Nangong Yifan unable to utilize his own power; he was able to completely seal away Nangong Yifan’s cultivation.

Because of that, the current Nangong Yifan was akin to a fish on the chopping block, waiting for Chu Feng to slaughter it.

“What is going on here?”

“What happened?”

Suddenly, lights flew over from all directions, and ultimately landed on the island

They were all elders of the Red-dress Holy Land.

They’d thought that something had happened after hearing Nangong Yifan’s furious shout, and rushed over because of that.

Seeing the scene before them, they were all confused and panicking.

They were unable to keep themselves from panicking. After all, the person lying on the ground was Nangong Yifan, the strongest genius of the All-heaven Sect, the future successor to the All-heaven Sect.

“Zhuanghong, what is going on here?”

“Why is young master Nangong injured?”

In a panic, the Red-dress Holy Land’s elders all turned to question Yin Zhuanghong with angry tones.

“Don’t blame her, I’m the one that beat him up.” said Chu Feng.

“What? It’s you?”

“Young master Asura, why did you beat up young master Nangong?”

The elders of the Red-dress Holy Land all looked to Chu Feng with astonishment.

“He wanted to do something immoral to Yin Zhuanghong, is it wrong for me to beat him up?” asked Chu Feng.

“This...”

Hearing those words and then seeing Yin Zhaunghong’s torn sleeve, the elders believed what Chu Feng said to be true.

But, even if that was the case, they still felt that he should not have beaten up Nangong Yifan.

“Sigh, young master Asura, you’ve truly...”

“You’ve courted great trouble this time around.”

The elders of the Red-dress Holy Land were not blaming Chu Feng. Instead, they were worried for him.

It was one thing for Chu Feng to offend anyone else. However, to injure Nangong Yifan was a serious offense.

Besides, so many experts from the All-heaven Sect were gathered there. Even that Tuoba Chengan was here.

The elders of the Red-dress Holy Land had no idea how to protect Chu Feng. In fact, they felt that they were no longer able to protect him. They felt that Chu Feng had committed a capital offense, and would likely lose his life.

“Courted great trouble?”

Chu Feng revealed an indifferent smile at their words.

Then, Chu Feng did something that astonished everyone present.

“All you people from the All-heaven Sect, scram out here for this young master!!!”

Chu Feng shouted loudly at the sky.

His voice was so resounding that it not only spread out from the island, but it even shook the heavens, and practically spread throughout the entire Red-dress Holy Land.
