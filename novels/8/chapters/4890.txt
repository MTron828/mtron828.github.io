Chapter 4890: Duped Again?

“The black spirit formation gates are indeed far more dangerous than the rest. The worst that can happen in the other spirit formation gates is sustaining injuries, but there’s a possibility that one might die in the black spirit formation gates.

“However, risk and opportunity often come hand in hand. Those who manage to clear the trial in the black spirit formation gates will obtain the greatest rewards. The choice is in your hand. Those who wish to choose the black spirit formation gate can sign up now. We’ll do it on a first-come-first-serve basis,” Chu Feng said,

“Ah...”

The crowd averted their gazes.

They were no fools. They wouldn’t want to lose their life while trying to raise their cultivation.

“Since no one wants to pick it, I guess I’ll just have to take the black spirit formation gate myself then. Pardon me, I’ll be making a move in advance.”

After saying those words, Chu Feng entered the black spirit formation gate. As soon as he stepped in, the black spirit formation gate suddenly stopped swirling, indicating that it had been closed.

“Menglai, is it possible that we have been duped by that fellow again? Why did he enter the spirit formation gate so candidly?” Shengguang Haoxuan asked with a deep frown.

“Why are you asking me? If you were daring enough, you could have taken the opportunity yourself. It’s not like he didn’t give you a choice. You simply don’t have guts to take it on.”

After saying her piece, Shengguang Menglai picked one of the blue spirit formation gates and entered it.

Shengguang Haoxuan and the others were left to stand there awkwardly.

It was out of goodwill that they approached Shengguang Menglai to discuss this matter. They were supposed to be a group here whereas Chu Feng was their common enemy. Yet, who could have thought that they would end up getting criticized by Shengguang Menglai?

What that further surprised them was that after Shengguang Menglai left, another even more jarring voice started to berate them.

“Big sister Menglai is right. You bunch of cowardly rascals! All you dare is to mumble behind his back! He already gave you the chance, but you didn’t dare to step up. Someone has to take the black spirit formation gate in the end.

“Chu Feng stood up and tanked the most dangerous one for us, but the moment he’s gone, the first thing you do is to turn around and gossip behind his back. Is that all you amount to?

“Shengguang Haoxuan, you’re the worst of them all. If you don’t trust Chu Feng at all, you should just leave this place. After all, you were only able to enter the golden spirit formation gate due to Chu Feng’s help.”

Shengguang Xintian berated the crowd, focusing especially on Shengguang Haoxuan. She wasn’t just running her mouth here. Her disdainful eyes showed that she meant what she had just said.

“Xintian, y-y-you... What’s come over you? We’re the victims here! Why are you suddenly speaking up for Chu Feng?”

Shengguang Haoxuan looked at Shengguang Xintian in bewilderment, unable to believe what he was hearing. It traumatized him greatly to be criticized by someone he fancied like this.

“Victims? We’re clearly the beneficiaries here! I don’t want to talk to an ingrate like you.”

Shengguang Xintian shot a cold glare at Shengguang Haoxuan before leaping into one of the golden spirit formation gates.

“You...”

Shengguang Haoxuan was so angry that his nostrils started flaring. He could still accept those words coming from Shengguang Menglai since she had always been that cold to everyone, but how could Shengguang Xintian speak up for Chu Feng?

Chu Feng was only an outsider!

“Everyone, don’t forget about our goal here. We’re here to cultivate. Hurry up and get into the spirit formation gates. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers,” Shengguang Chuyao said before entering one of the spirit formation gates himself.

Seeing that, the crowd quickly chose a spirit formation gate and entered it too. Shengguang Haoxuan was infuriated, but he still entered the golden spirit formation gate anyway. As much as he hated Chu Feng, he wasn’t going to give up this precious cultivation opportunity over him.

Upon entering the spirit formation gate, they found themselves faced with a trial. The speed at which they cleared the trial differed according to their talents.

Shengguang Menglai, who entered the blue formation gate, was the first one to clear her trial. In just an hour’s time, she had already walked out from her blue formation gate.

There weren’t any injuries on her, but her fair face had a few beads of sweat on it. She was also breathing significantly heavier than before.

It seemed like it wasn’t smooth-sailing for her either despite her strength.

The first thing she did upon leaving the spirit formation gate was to assess her surroundings, and she revealed a rare smile upon seeing that no one was in the vicinity.

She was extremely competitive despite being a woman. It satisfied her to know that she was the first one to clear the trial.

“You’re already back? Not bad.”

A voice suddenly sounded from behind the black formation gate.

Shortly after, Chu Feng walked out.

“You... have already cleared your trial?”

Shengguang Menglai was surprised. She noticed that Chu Feng’s face was completely relaxed, and there weren’t any beads of sweat to be seen on his face at all.

If Chu Feng had cleared the trial around the same time as her, it would mean that he had a much easier time there. It was just that the spirit formation gate he had entered was the hardest black one.

“I was just a little earlier than you,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Shengguang Menglai subconsciously turned to look at the black formation gate.

“Don’t bother. I know what you’re thinking. You’re lucky that I was the one who took the black formation gate. If anyone else entered it, I reckon that they wouldn’t have been able to make it out alive,” Chu Feng said.

“Do you underestimate us that much?” Shengguang Menglai asked.

“I’m not underestimating you all. I’m just stating facts,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

Shengguang Menglai didn’t argue with Chu Feng on that. She sat on the ground and closed her eyes, seemingly immersing herself in her cultivation.

Chu Feng also didn’t bother trying to engage her in a conversation either. He sat down on the ground and closed his eyes as well.

Not too long later, Shengguang Chuyao and the others stepped out from their respective spirit formation gates too.

“Brother Chu Feng, you’re safe! That’s a relief.”

Shengguang Chuyao was the only one who showed concern for Chu Feng after leaving his spirit formation gate. In response, Chu Feng specially opened his eyes and waved at him with a smile before returning to his cultivation.

The rest of the crowd chose to gather around Shengguang Menglai’s side.

They didn’t seem to be in a good condition. Shengguang Chuyao’s face was a little pale, and the others had some injuries on them.

In comparison, Shengguang Menglai was clearly in a much better state. This made them realize that Shengguang Menglai had cleared her trial with relative ease compared to them.

They were quite surprised to see that Chu Feng was already out by the time they left the spirit formation gate, so they couldn’t help but wonder whether it was Chu Feng or Shengguang Menglai who cleared the trial faster.

Those who were younger tended to get more competitive over such meaningless honor.

One of the juniors stepped forward and asked, “Miss Menglai, were you the first one to clear the trial?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I wasn’t,” Shengguang Menglai replied with a slightly cold tone

Her response disappointed the crowd a little.

The disciples of the Holy Valley glanced at Chu Feng once more to assess his current condition, but the latter looked like he didn’t even sweat a single droplet.

They started exchanging perplexed gazes with one another, seemingly telepathically asking one another if they had been duped once again.

Could it be that the trial behind the black formation gate wasn’t anything dangerous?

It was only normal for them to harbor such thoughts. If it had really been that dangerous, it was hard to fathom how Chu Feng managed to clear it with such ease.
