Chapter 5952: Xianhai Shuoyi

“Are you certain?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am. It’s no secret,” Little Fishy replied.

“Are those four remnants still around?”

“They should be. The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnants are renowned for how dangerous they are. Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion tread carefully around them.”

Chu Feng was overjoyed to hear that.

He had obtained one of the five key fragments, and the remaining four were located in remnants that were difficult to clear. This meant that he still stood a chance at obtaining them.

“Big brother, why are you asking about this? Do you plan on entering those remnants?”

“I’m just curious. I’ll visit them if I have a chance.”

“I’ll go with you.”

“There’s no need for that. I’ll go on my own. You should obediently stay in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. The Netherworld Sect has already set their eyes on you.”

“Fine, but big brother, you must promise me to not go to the remnants in the Seven Realms Galaxy and the Divine Body Galaxy.”

“Why?”

“The one in the Seven Realms Galaxy has been sealed off by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Outsiders aren’t allowed to enter. As for the one in the Divine Body Galaxy, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has been trying to decipher it, and it’s rumored that they made significant progress some time ago and are on the verge of clearing it. Thus, it’s best not to get involved at this juncture.”

“I see.”

Jie Tianran should have known that four of the five key fragments were located in the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnants, which were relatively more difficult to clear compared to the one in the Immortal Sea Galaxy.

Even so, he still chose to send his subordinates to the Immortal Sea Galaxy instead of personally coming here to secure this key fragment first.

This suggested that the rumors could be true, and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was close to clearing the two Ancestral Martial Realm Sect’s remnants in the Seven Realms Galaxy and Divine Body Galaxy. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jie Tianran might have thought it would be better to go after the key fragments he had already made good progress on than to pursue one that he knew nothing about. Of course, there could be other reasons at play too.

He was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master, so there were bound to be many matters he needed to attend to, especially given the tumultuous climate.

Chu Feng proceeded to ask about the Netherworld Sect.

Little Fishy avoided saying that she was deceived by someone disguised as Chu Feng; she brushed it off to her carelessness. She had no idea what the Netherworld Sect was up to, as she had lost consciousness during her capture, and by the time she woke up, she was already with Chu Feng.

“Little Fishy, do you know how I found you?” Chu Feng asked.

“How?” Little Fishy was curious.

“I have a friend in the Netherworld Sect. She was the one who leaked your information to me. However, this matter has to be kept confidential.”

“Got it. I won’t tell anyone.”

“She did suggest a reason why the Netherworld Sect went after you—they were hoping to use you as fodder to raise the cultivation of one of their prodigies.”

“Me? But I don’t have any connections with the Netherworld Sect.” Little Fishy was baffled.

“We aren’t familiar with their means, and I’m not sure how reliable my news is. Even so, you need to be careful. Don’t move around alone. If you have to leave the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, make sure to have your clan’s experts accompany you.”

“Got it, big brother. I’ll be careful. I won’t let them capture me again. Let’s go, big brother. I’ll take you to our Immortal Sea Fish Clan’s cultivation spot.”

With that, she dragged Chu Feng to the Myriad Immortals Refinement Lakes.

It was located on a towering mountain reminiscent of a tower. This mountain comprised many layers stacked on top of one another, and each layer contained a lake emanating an immortal aura.

These lakes weren’t too big; the largest one only spanned a diameter of fifty meters, whereas the smallest one was only a meter wide. The lakes located higher up the mountain contained less water, but they emanated a richer immortal aura.

Even though this place was known as the Myriad Immortals Refinement Lakes, there were at least a few million lakes here.

Many Immortal Sea Fish Clansmen were cultivating here. Most of them were juniors, but there were some elders too. Little Fishy and Chu Feng didn’t conceal themselves, so their arrival drew attention.

“Her Highness Yu’er is here!”

“Who’s that person next to Her Highness Yu’er? Why does he look so familiar?”

“He... seems to be Chu Feng?”

“My gosh! It really is Chu Feng!”

“Jie Ranqing’s son has come to our Immortal Sea Fish Clan?”

Those people didn’t know that Little Fishy was caught by the Netherworld Sect, but they were both shocked and flattered to see Little Fishy and Chu Feng here.

“My brother and I have been cultivating in our clan’s bloodline forbidden land, so it has been a while since I was last here. I miss it quite a bit,” Little Fishy looked at the beautiful scenery and remarked.

She then turned to Chu Feng and said, “Big brother, the lakes higher up the mountain contain greater energy, but that doesn’t mean that you’ll benefit more from the lakes at a higher altitude. Go with your gut feeling instead. All right, you should choose an immortal lake now.”

“I have already decided.” Chu Feng flew toward one of the immortal lakes in the middle of the mountain.

His intuition told him that this lake would be the best for him to assimilate the Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads.

Chu Feng and Little Fishy’s arrival had caused a commotion, but no one bothered them due to the rules governing this cultivation spot. Thus, Chu Feng could cultivate in peace despite there being many people around.

Chu Feng didn’t want to cause a commotion too, so he refined the Sacred Temple Beads in a discreet manner. He had to concede that the effectiveness of the Sacred Temple Beads were greatly enhanced by the Myriad Immortals Refinement Lakes.

He was now confident that he could make a breakthrough with the Sacred Temple Beads.

However, his goal was to only refine the Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads; he wasn’t intending to make a breakthrough here. While the Immortal Sea Fish Clan didn’t mind being associated with him, he didn’t want to bring them trouble as much as possible.

His breakthrough would cause a phenomenon beyond his control.

Rumors about him visiting the Immortal Sea Fish Clan could be easily disputed, but his breakthrough would be concrete evidence that he was on close terms with the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.

Meanwhile, a young man was cultivating at the highest peak of the Myriad Immortals Refinement Lake. The lakewater around him suddenly bubbled, and he opened his eyes.

“I have finally reached rank nine Martial Exalted level! A step more, and I’ll reach rank one Half-God level. Yu’er, wait for me. I’ll surely catch up to you. I’ll let you know that I’m the only person worthy of you in this world!” the man said with a beaming smile.

He was Xianhai Shuoyi.
