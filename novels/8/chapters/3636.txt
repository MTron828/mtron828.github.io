Chapter 3636 - Really A Monster

“Chen Hui, that guy has clearly failed. What’s there to admire?” the All-heaven Starfield’s head flag-bearer asked.

He was unable to understand Chen Hui’s reaction.

“Judging from the final results, he has indeed failed. However, in the short time earlier, he indeed managed to assimilate that overwhelming amount of chess power into his body.”

“Even though the duration was very short, he still managed to accomplish it.”

“With such an overwhelming amount of chess power entering his body, regardless of whether or not he was able to ultimately contain the chess power, the fact that he’ still able to remain in the chess formation is already very amazing. Furthermore, this guy seems to be unaffected in the slightest.”

“I don’t possess the ability that he does. Likely, Nangong Yifan would not be able to accomplish such a feat either,” said Chen Hui.

Hearing what Chen Hui said, the crowd felt what he said to be somewhat reasonable.

However, they were still looking at Chu Feng with contempt.

The victor was king, and the loser the bandit. They did not care about the process, only the results.

In the end, even though Chu Feng had caused such a massive commotion, it served absolutely no purpose.

“Everyone, listen carefully. From this point on, stand still and do not move.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Suddenly, Chu Feng’s voice was heard.

“Ah?”

“What is he talking about?”

“Is he talking to us?”

The crowd were confused by Chu Feng’s words.

However, Chu Feng did not attempt to explain what he meant to the crowd at all. He seemed to have no care for what the crowd was thinking as he straightened his chest, raised his head and spread open his arms.

His appearance appeared very arrogant. It was as if the entire world was his.

“Did that guy’s head receive some sort of shock from the assimilation failure from earlier?”

“He’s truly a clown fond of showing off.”

“So what if he’s a Saint-cloak World Spiritist? With how brain-dead he is, he’s destined to become useless.”

Seeing Chu Feng like that, the people from the All-heaven Starfield felt great displeasure.

The reason why they felt such displeasure for Chu Feng was not merely because they were confused by his actions.

Instead, it was because he had brought upon them deep fear and enormous threat for a short time earlier.

“Rumble~~~”

Suddenly, the earth started to tremble once again.

Different from the trembling of both heaven and earth from previously, the trembling was limited to only the earth this time around.

Furthermore, the trembling was extremely intense. Cracks appeared in many places, and some of the ground even began to collapse.

Smoke and dust filled the air. and all kinds of ferocious beasts were fleeing in panic.

As far as the eye could see, chaos and confusion ensued. It was as if the world would soon perish.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Not long afterward, bodies of light flew off from the ground. They were flying toward the crowd.

“Heavens, those are?!!!”

Upon seeing those incoming bodies of light, the crowd’s expressions changed enormously.

Those bodies of light came from every corner of the first world. They were either armor, helmets, or weapons.

Most importantly, contained in those items was very strong chess power. Those were all treasures containing chess power, treasures capable of helping the crowd increase their chess power.

Should one don those treasures, one’s chess power would be strengthened. Furthermore, those treasures were only able to increase one’s chess power. They would not cause any burden to one’s control over one’s own chess power.

“What is happening? Why would those hidden treasures suddenly appear like this? Furthermore, they’ve appeared in such numbers?”

“Could it be that it has something to do with that guy?”

Not to mention the younger generations from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, even the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were all looking at Chu Feng.

This sudden abnormality and Chu Feng’s strange actions caused the crowd to be unable to keep themselves from connecting the scene before them with Chu Feng.

“That guy, exactly how did he accomplish this?”

The crowd were all astonished. One must know that both the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations and the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations had attempted to search for the hidden treasures before. They had wanted to use the hidden treasures to gain the upper hand in the match of Ancestral Martial Cultivator Chess.

Unfortunately, those hidden treasures were simply too difficult to find. Furthermore, a large amount of time would be wasted searching for them. Because of that, both parties gave up on searching for them, and decided to directly absorb chess power to gain victory with their own capabilities.

It was precisely because the crowd knew that hidden treasures were very difficult to find that they were so astonished.

Judging from the numbers of hidden treasures before them, likely all of the hidden treasures in the first world had been unearthed by Chu Feng.

What sort of ability was this?!!!

It simply shattered the crowd’s understanding.

Right at that moment, the head flag-bearer from the All-heaven Starfield shouted, “Don’t just stand there! Quickly, snatch those treasures!!!”

After he shouted those words, not only did the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations react to his words, but even the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations reacted to them.

At that moment, the two parties both soared into the sky and rushed to scramble for the treasures flying toward them like meteors.

“Bang, bang, bang~~~”

“Wuuahh~~~”

“Eeeahhh~~~”

Once the scramble began, screams started sounding.

Many of the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations not only failed to control the treasures upon touching them, but they were instead injured by the power of the treasures.

“Those treasures cause injuries!!!”

Upon reacting to what was happening, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations immediately stopped attempting to scramble for the treasures because they did not wish to suffer major casualties in the process.

“Something’s wrong!!!”

Soon, they discovered that even though they were injured by the treasures when they tried to take them, the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were not injured by the treasures.

It turned out that they were the only ones that were being injured by the treasures’ chess power.

Furthermore, as if they’d recognized the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations as their masters, the treasures were not only easily obtained by the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations that rushed up to snatch them, but they would even forcibly land on the bodies of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations that were standing there motionlessly.

It was as if those treasures belonged to the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations to begin with.

Soon, the treasures that emerged from all over the first world were all in the possession of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations.

At that moment, every one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations possessed at least a single treasure. Some even possessed three or four.

The All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations, on the other hand, had none. Not even someone like Chen Hui was able to snatch a single treasure.

“What the hell is this?!”

Seeing such a thing, the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations felt enormous shock.

That said, they were not the only ones dumbfounded. The Ancestral Martial Starfield’s younger generations were equally dumbfounded.

They knew that they were not able to subdue those treasures due to their own capabilities. Instead, those treasures forcibly landed on them. It was like they were being controlled by someone.

“Could it be, because of Chu Feng?”

Suddenly, all of the people of the younger generation present thought of a possibility.

Thus, all their gazes uniformly turned to Chu Feng.

Faced with the crowd’s gazes, the corners of Chu Feng’s lips rose into a smile.

“I’ve told you all, with me, Chu Feng, present, victory in this world’s contest is determined,” said Chu Feng.

“Sssss~~~”

At that moment, both the Ancestral Martial Starfield and the All-heaven Starfield’s younger generations were unable to keep themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

It was only at that moment that they’d realized that the person they thought to be boasting was really a monster!!!
