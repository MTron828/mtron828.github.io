Chapter 5685: Ling Canghai’s Identity

Chapter 5685: Ling Canghai’s Identity

The crowd was initially taken aback, but they quickly understood Chu Feng’s intention.

While they weren’t that happy about Chu Feng’s tantrum, this was still what they wanted. They needed Chu Feng to fail in order to uphold the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s reputation.

What they didn’t know was that while it was true that Chu Feng needed to simultaneously deal with the seven trials, he could deal with it. It would be difficult, but it was not beyond him to do so.

His initial goal was to fail. He knew that the crowd would only leave him be if he failed.

But when he activated the Seven Realms Challenge Formation and understood its rules, he changed his mind.

There were actually no significant benefits to clearing the Seven Realms Challenge Formation. Those who succeeded would have an honorary token fused into their bodies that they could produce at any moment to prove that they had completed the challenge.

However, this also meant that no one could tell if he succeeded or not if he didn’t produce the token.

Thus, Chu Feng decided to clear all seven challenges. He figured that he could whip out all seven honorary tokens to humiliate the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion when he fell out with them in the future.

They would regret acting so gleefully today.

But again, it was no easy feat to simultaneously challenge all seven trials. He needed time to adapt to it too. Thus, he ended up in the formation longer than the crowd expected.

“Why isn’t he out yet?”

“Does he really intend to challenge all seven trials at once?”

“What’s that bastard up to?!”

Time ticked by, but Chu Feng remained in the formation. The crowd slowly realized that they might have misunderstood the situation. Chu Feng could have been seriously challenging the formation instead of throwing a tantrum.

“Lord Saint-tier Elder.”

Some of the elders discreetly sent a voice transmission to Ling Mouzi, hoping that he would tamper with the formation. They couldn’t allow Chu Feng to succeed.

It was one thing for Ling Xiao’s record to be broken, but they would be utterly humiliated if Jie Ranqing’s record was broken too.

“Don’t make a rash move. This is the Seven Realms Challenge Formation. It’s impossible to tamper with it once it’s activated. It’ll be immediately revealed if you attempt to tamper with it; you’ll only be embarrassing our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Ling Mouzi replied via voice transmission.

However, he quickly added, “You don’t need to be too worried. There’s no way he’d succeed.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He was more confident than the others.

Eventually, the formation came to a halt, and Chu Feng sat weakly on the ground.

Upon seeing his depressed expression, the crowd heaved a sigh of relief.

“I guess that’s all you amount to, Chu Feng. I was still thinking how formidable you are to challenge all seven trials at once,” the red-haired man sneered.

“Indeed! You dragged the challenge out for so long that I thought you would succeed, but it turns out you were just wasting our time.”

“Had I known, I would have already gone home. I’d rather spend my time talking to my world spirits instead!”

The other juniors joined the red-haired man to rub it in for Chu Feng.

“Shut up!” the Saint-tier elder, Ling Mouzi, stopped them with a roar, “Young friend Chu Feng will be a member of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion soon. It doesn’t matter whether the Seven Stars Gravity Towers have been recalibrated or not; it’s still a remarkable feat for him to clear all seven towers. As for the Seven Realms Challenge Formation, who else can challenge all seven trials aside from Miss Jie Ranqing? Can any of you?”

The crowd immediately stopped their taunting.

Ling Mouzi then turned to Ling Xinian and said, “Xinian, bring young friend Chu Feng elsewhere to rest.”

It was upon hearing his command that Ling Xinian dared to approach Chu Feng. She worriedly asked, “Little brother Chu Feng, are you all right?”

“Big sister Xinian, I’m fine,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.

“Don’t let this get you down, little brother Chu Feng. Lord Jie Ranqing was the only one to have cleared all seven trials. It’s only normal for you to fail,” Ling Xinian supported Chu Feng to his feet while comforting him.

She had persuaded Chu Feng to intentionally fail the challenge, but she could tell that he actually didn’t want to fail and had tried his best for it. Nevertheless, this was the outcome she had hoped for.

Saint-tier Elder Ling Mouzi had made his stance clear—Chu Feng was still important to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, so she had to console him lest he harbor any hostility toward them over this incident.

What she didn’t know was that Chu Feng was fine, for he had succeeded in the challenge.

…

Just then, Chu Feng noticed a God-cloak elder departing from the area. To his astonishment, the crowd, including Saint-tier Elder Ling Mouzi, respectfully saw him off.

That elder hadn’t said a word at all, but his eyes had been fixated on Chu Feng from the start to the end. It made him feel a little uncomfortable.

“Who’s that elder? He seems to be someone special,” Chu Feng asked Ling Xinian.

“That’s Lord Canghai. You mustn’t disrespect him. Let’s head back first. I’ll elaborate more along the way,” Ling Xinian said.

On the way back, Chu Feng learned that the elder whom the crowd respectfully saw off was Ling Canghai. He was an extremely senior figure in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, being from the same generation as the World Spiritist Immortal King.

In his younger years, he was a prodigy whose name was spoken alongside the World Spiritist Immortal King. The two of them towered above the juniors of the other powerhouses back then, and they brought a lot of glory to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.

However, as they grew older, a gap started to appear between him and the World Spiritist Immortal King. In particular, he was suddenly unable to make a breakthrough anymore upon becoming a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist.

He had already been at pinnacle God-cloak for tens of thousands of years now. It was not just for show that he was dubbed the strongest world spiritist beneath True Dragon World Spiritists. There were indeed no world spiritists beneath True Dragon who could best him.

Of course, the reason he was so respected was not due to his superior strength as a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist but his seniority and the glory he had brought to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion back then.

“Given that elder’s talent, it shouldn’t have been difficult for him to make a breakthrough and become a True Dragon World Spiritist. Is there a reason he hasn’t done so?” Chu Feng asked.

“There are rumors that Lord Canghai is cultivating a unique psyche cultivation skill. We don’t exactly know why he’s holding back his breakthrough, but you can be certain he’d be a force to be reckoned with once he makes a breakthrough. Make sure you keep this matter confidential. You mustn’t tell anyone about it,” Ling Xinian told Chu Feng via voice transmission.
