Chapter 5364: Invitation from the Nine Heavens’ Zenith

“How strong is Ling Xiao then?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“I can’t reveal that. You’ll know in due time,” Jie Yu replied.

“Tsk. What’s there to hide about this? I mean, he’s either at Royal Dragon God-cloak or Immortal God-cloak, right? Besides, he went to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, didn’t he? We’ll know how strong he is very soon anyway,” Bai Yunqing said.

Ignoring Bai Yunqing, Jie Yu turned to Chu Feng and passed a communication talisman to Chu Feng as he said, “Rest well, Chu Feng. Feel free to call me if you need anything. I’ll be taking my leave now.”

Chu Feng accepted the communication talisman, but he couldn’t help but ask, “Didn’t you mention that there are things you would like to verify?”

“There’s no need for that anymore. I already have my answer. You’re the real deal. I shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions that quickly,” Jie Yu replied before taking his leave.

“Big brother Chu Feng, it looks like you have won that fellow over. Look at how his attitude has changed. Not a trace of his past arrogance at all,” Bai Yunqing said.

“He was conceited, but at least he had principles. What do you think?” Chu Feng asked.

“I don’t know. There are only two people I trust in the world. One is my master, and the other one is you,” Bai Yunqing said.

“You mentioned the Nine Heavens’ Zenith earlier. What is that?” Chu Feng asked.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Big brother Chu Feng, you can think of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith as a place similar to the Ancient Realm. It has a long history behind it, and it is often drifting around the land, making it impossible to pinpoint its location. However, the Nine Heavens’ Zenith is much more famous than the Ancient Realm.

“First and foremost, the ruler of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, Master Nine Zenith, is a powerful individual who is well-versed in both cultivation and formations. In fact, there are rumors that he is on par with the galaxy overlords.

There is a humongous formation spanning the entire Nine Heavens’ Zenith, and the formation is known as the Heavens Ranking. As soon as the Heavens Ranking opens, it’ll be visible to everyone in the world of cultivation. You’re a world spiritist yourself, so can you imagine just how powerful must one be in order to pull that off?” Bai Yunqing asked.

Chu Feng could hardly imagine just how much spirit power it would take in order to make something visible to the entire world of cultivation, especially considering how huge the universe was.

“The Nine Heavens’ Zenith would periodically send out invitations, and those who received an invitation would usually participate in the event. Do you know why?” Bai Yunqing asked.

“Why?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s because the Nine Heavens’ Zenith only invites the strongest juniors out in the world of cultivation. Not every single generation of juniors has received an invitation; that in itself should tell you how strict the criteria are. Just receiving an invitation in itself is proof that an individual is a huge deal in the current era.

“Let me put it this way. The last time the Nine Heavens’ Zenith sent out an invitation was in Lord Jie Ranqing’s era. Since then, no one has been invited to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith till now. In fact, Lord Jie Ranqing’s generation was the first time in a long while anyone has been invited to the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. Furthermore, I heard that the invitations this time around are different from usual,” Bai Yunqing said.

“What’s the difference?” Chu Feng asked.

“I heard that the last time the Nine Heavens’ Zenith opened, the other powers paid a visit to Master Nine Zenith to request that their prodigies be allowed to compete on the Nine Heavens’ Zenith. It was out of respect for those powers that Master Nine Zenith issued the invitations. This time around, Master Nine Zenith did it on his own accord,” Bai Yunqing said.

“You’re saying that not even the juniors in Lord Jie Ranqing’s era were enough for Master Nine Zenith to send out invitations? In other words, the juniors of the current era are much stronger?” Chu Feng asked.

“You can take it that way, but that’s only to be expected. Lord Jie Ranqing was indeed powerful, but none of the prodigies that shared her era are close to her level. On the other hand, we’re currently in the God’s Era. There are simply too many outstanding juniors out there. Someone of my strength could have easily been the strongest junior back then, but in the current era, I’m nowhere close at all,” Bai Yunqing said.

“In other words, those who have been invited to Nine Heavens’ Zenith will have a fight there to decide who is the strongest, then the Heavens Rankboard will announce the result to the entire world of cultivation?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. It’s basically a tournament for juniors. All of the top prodigies have been invited, including the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Ling Xiao. The result should be out very soon. By then, we’ll get to witness the legendary Heavens Rankboard with our own eyes. You should know that the Heavens Rankboard didn’t even trigger back in Lord Jie Ranqing’s era!” Bai Yunqing said.

Those words revealed that the tournament conducted at the Nine Heavens’ Zenith back in Jie Ranqing’s era wasn’t an official one, which explained why the result wasn’t announced by the Heavens Rankboard.

Things were different this time around. The tournament was conducted under the free will of the Nine Heavens’ Zenith, so the legendary Heavens Rankboard that was said to be able to reach the entire world of cultivation would make an appearance once more.

“It sure is a pity that the Nine Heavens’ Zenith isn’t an open competition. I would have loved to watch Xianhai Shaoyu in action!” Bai Yunqing remarked.

Chu Feng’s interest was piqued upon hearing Xianhai Shaoyu’s name. “Who do you think will win the tournament?”

“Of course it’s Xianhai Shaoyu! He’s known to be the strongest prodigy of the Nine Galaxies! Not even our Totem Galaxy’s Long Chengyu can put up a fight against him! You can even say that he’s the Jie Ranqing of our era… though his younger sister, Xianhai Yu’er, seems to be even more talented, given how she had left her name in the Immemorial Star Sea.

“It’s a pity that the world doesn’t know that our big brother Chu Feng is a rising star from the fallen Ancestral Martial Galaxy. I look forward to the day when people learn about what you are capable of!” Bai Yunqing said with an expectant look on his face.

“You’ll have a place in God’s Era too,” Chu Feng said.

“That goes without saying. I might not be in the highest echelon, but I shouldn’t appear too shabby lest I embarrass you,” Bai Yunqing said.

“I don’t think you should call me big brother. We’re good brothers; there shouldn’t be any hierarchy between us,” Chu Feng said.

“That won’t do. I’ve already acknowledged you as my big brother!” Bai Yunqing said.

“Oh well. I guess I have no choice but to work even harder. I’d become a laughingstock if I, as the big brother, am unable to protect my little brother,” Chu Feng said.

“Hahaha! Let’s work hard together!” Bai Yunqing said.

Meanwhile, Jie Yu had entered a palace, where the old woman and a black-haired middle-aged woman were waiting for him. The black-haired middle-aged woman was none other than Lord Shuang Yu.

“Is that for real? Did Chu Feng really manage to claim the Life Crystal inside the trial?” Jie Yu asked in astonishment.

Lord Shuang Yu had her doubts when she learned about the result of the trial. She couldn’t understand how Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing could walk out unscathed from that entrance and even nourish a crystal of that tier. She tried to investigate the matter through her means, and that was when she noticed that the Life Crystal inside the trial had vanished.

“I can’t be certain whether they are the ones who took it, but the Life Crystal can’t possibly disappear for no reason. It’s probably their doing,” Lord Shuang Yu said.

“It must be Chu Feng then, Lord Shuang Yu. I just witnessed Chu Feng awakening the Life Crystal I have lost to him with my own eyes! He’s an extraordinary world spiritist. I don’t think that there is anyone in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who can rival him,” Jie Yu said.

“Young master Jie Yu, what nonsense are you spouting?” Lord Shuang Yu’s face turned cold.

“Lord Shuang Yu, there’s no doubt that Chu Feng is an extremely powerful individual. Even though he isn’t from our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, we ought to acknowledge his strength. In fact, I hope to have him accompany me to the Ancient Palace,” Jie Yu said.

Lord Shuang Yu’s face darkened. “Young master Jie Yu, are you out of your mind? How can an outsider be allowed to accompany you into the Ancient Palace?”

However, Jie Yu remained adamant about his stance. “Lord Shuang Yu, I need his help. I hope that you can accede to my request.”

“That won’t do. Even if I permit it, young miss Ling Mo’er and young master Jie Zhou won’t accept it. Unless you’re able to convince them, I’m afraid that I can’t call the shots on this,” Lord Shuang Yu said.

“Lord Shuang Yu, can’t you think of a way to pull it off?” Jie Yu asked.

“I already told you that it’s against the rules. If you really want Chu Feng to accompany you, you should personally negotiate with young miss Ling Mo’er and young master Jie Zhou by yourself. If they are fine with it, I’ll turn a blind eye to this matter,” Lord Shuang Yu said.

Jie Yu frowned. He dared not to mess with Ling Mo’er and Jie Zhou.
