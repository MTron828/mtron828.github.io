Chapter 3375 - Person To Pay Attention To

Firstly, the Starfield Master Realm was the current overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. That was something that everyone knew.

Apart from the Starfield Master Realm, the Ten Great Heavenly Clans also had to be mentioned.

In order of decreasing strength, the Ten Great Heavenly Clans were respectively...

Linghu Heavenly Clan.

Tantai Heavenly Clan. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Jiaoli Heavenly Clan.

Moyi Heavenly Clan.

Shangfang Heavenly Clan.

Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan.

Wuma Heavenly Clan.

Puyang Heavenly Clan.

Tang Heavenly Clan.

Li Heavenly Clan.

Of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, the Linghu Heavenly Clan, Tantai Heavenly Clan and Jiaoli Heavenly Clan were the strongest.

The reason those three Heavenly Clans were listed separately from others was because the three of them were all headed by an Utmost Exalted-level expert.

From this, one could tell what sort of status Utmost Exalted-level experts possessed in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

That was also the reason why the people in the Ancient Era’s remnant would become so afraid of Chu Feng upon finding out that the Moon Immortal was an Utmost Exalted.

Apart from the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, the Ancestral Martial Starfield also possessed three very powerful clans.

They were respectively...

The Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.

The Nightmare Ghost Clan.

And the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan.

The Three Clans did not possess Heavenly Bloodlines. However, they each possessed a special bloodline, and were all very powerful.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you should’ve heard about the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, right? After all, your clan’s Chu Xuanzhengfa had a daughter with the princess of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, Gu Mingyuan. I believe their daughter is called Chu Lingxi, no?”

“Speaking of it, that boy Chu Xuanzhengfa is quite capable. Even though Gu Mingyuan ended up being unwilling to marry him, she admitted that the child was between the two of them.”

When mentioning the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief began to bring up the matter between Chu Xuanzhengfa and the princess of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, Gu Mingyuan.

“I have indeed heard about the matter between senior Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan’s princess. However, I had thought that they were husband and wife the entire time,” Chu Feng said.

“Husband and wife? How could that be possible? That’s the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan’s Gu Mingyuan we’re talking about here.”

“You should know that there used to be a saying in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Among men, Chu Xuanyuan. Among women, Gu Mingyuan. That girl’s talent is extremely amazing. The reason why the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan was able to gain their current status was not due to their clan chief. Instead, it was because of that girl,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

‘No wonder our Chu Heavenly Clan seems to have had no interaction with the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan,’ Chu Feng gasped in his heart.

With how powerful the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan was, and how Gu Mingyuan was unwilling to recognize Chu Xuanzhengfa as her husband, how could they possibly be willing to interact with the Chu Heavenly Clan?

“I’ve heard that girl Chu Lingxi’s talent is also outstanding. Young friend Chu Feng, do you know how strong Chu Lingxi is currently?” As the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, Wuma Shengjie also looked to Chu Feng.

Chu Lingxi was, after all, Gu Mingyuan’s daughter. As such, they were all very curious as to how powerful she was.

“Lingxi?”

“I’ve only heard that that girl has been taken back by her mother. As such, I have no idea how she is doing currently.”

“However, as she’s being nurtured by her mother, she must’ve made a lot of progress,” Chu Feng began to miss Chu Lingxi a bit when mentioning her.

In terms of relationships, Chu Lingxi must be the person with the best relationship with Chu Feng among the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.

After all, that girl had stood beside him when the Chu Heavenly Clan refused to acknowledge him.

As such, in Chu Feng’s heart, no other clansman could compare to Chu Lingxi.

“Taken away by Gu Mingyuan? In that case, another exceptional genius will likely appear in the Ancestral Martial Starfield,” Upon learning that Chu Lingxi was being nurtured by Gu Mingyuan, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief also began to look forward to it.

“Definitely,” Chu Feng was also filled with confidence in Chu Lingxi.

“Right. Chu Feng, apart from those clans, there are also Three Cities in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“They are respectively... “

“Monstrous Holy City, Divine Body Royal City and Ancestral Martial Dragon City.”

“Those three cities possess strength on par with the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the Tantai Heavenly Clan, and the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan.”

“The reason for that is because the Three Cities are also each headed by an Utmost Exalted-level expert.”

“Oh, that’s right, the Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spritist Lord Long Xuan that Lord Wuming Fenghuo mentioned earlier is from Ancestral Martial Dragon City,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“Never would I have imagined that there are actually so many strong powers in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Senior, since the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan and the Three Cities are so powerful, why haven’t their younger generations participated in the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars?”

Earlier, the Wuma Heavenly Clan had explained the current rankings of the Ancestral Martial Decastars to Chu Feng.

From strongest to weakest, they were respectively...

Linghu Hongfei.

Linghu Yueyue.

Linghu Tiemian.

Tantai Xing’er

Linghu Mingye.

Linghu Lun.

Mengyan Wushuang.

Tongtian Yuanming.

Tang Zhenghao.

Li Anzhi.

The Linghu Heavenly Clan occupied five spots among the current Ancestral Martial Decastars. From this, one could imagine how powerful they were.

Apart from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the Tantai Heavenly Clan, the Nightmare Ghost Clan, the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan, the Tang Heavenly Clan, and the Li Heavenly Clan each held a spot.

“There are also people from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan who will participate in the selection. Merely, after Gu Mingyuan, no one from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan has been able to rank among the Ancestral Martial Decastars.”

“That said, that is understandable too. After all, while one’s clan is powerful, that does not mean that one’s younger generations will be powerful too. There are a lot of powers that possess no qualified successors to carry on their undertakings. Besides, there are also a lot of people that fail to reveal their talent before a hundred years of age, and only manage to suddenly emerge in talent after they’re already over a hundred years old. Them not being ranked among the Ancestral Martial Decastars does not represent everything.”

“As for the Three Cities, they have never involved themselves with anything in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. As long as no one provokes them, they will never interfere with matters of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.”

“Although they are famous throughout the Ancestral Martial Starfield, and so powerful that not even the Starfield Master Realm dares to show negligence, the Three Cities actually never fight for fame or profit, and live in a half-secluded state,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.

“So that’s the case. Thank you for enlightening me, senior,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, if you are able to unseal this young lady’s seal ahead of time and are able to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, you, with your strength, wouldn’t have to worry about the majority of the contestants.”

“However, you cannot be careless against Linghu Yueyue, Linghu Tiemian and Tantai Xing’er. Especially that Linghu Yueyue. She is the Linghu Heavenly Clan’s younger generation second to only Linghu Hongfei. She is extremely powerful,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief reminded Chu Feng.

“I think I don’t have to fear any of them. I merely need to pay attention to a single person,” Chu Feng said.

“Who?” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked curiously.

Chu Feng did not answer. Instead, he smiled and looked to Wuma Shengjie beside him.
