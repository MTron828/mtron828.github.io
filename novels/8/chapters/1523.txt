MGA: Chapter 1524 - Intense Showdown

“While your cultivation is sufficient, I do not know what your battle power amounts to.”

Yan Xie smiled lightly. After that, his footsteps changed. He turned into a ray of light and instantly arrived in front of Chu Feng.

He did not use any martial skills. Instead, he had chosen to fight against Chu Feng through close quarters combat.

“Pa, pa, pa~~~”

As Yan Xie’s fists and palms moved around in the sky, it was extremely dazzling and a feast for the eyes.

However, this was still not a martial skill. Yan Xie was merely attacking Chu Feng with his physical body. However, Yan Xie’s attacks were not at all inferior to martial skills.

At Yan Xie’s level, a snap of his fingers could shatter space, and a stomp of his foot could crack the earth. His ability to utilize martial power was near the pinnacle. His each and every attack was very strong. His each and every movement was made of perfection.

One could tell instantly whether or not someone was an expert when they unleashed their skills. Yan Xie’s attacks caused Chu Feng to instantly feel a giant wave of pressure. In an instant, every single joint and every single cell in Chu Feng’s body felt an enormous amount of threat.

If Yan Xie’s attacks were to land, Chu Feng would not only be harmed in one location. Instead, all of his joints would be snapped apart. Chu Feng would be utterly defeated.

This was the first time that Chu Feng had felt such enormous oppression from someone of the same cultivation. Sure enough, Yan Xie was very powerful.

However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng still remained very calm and unhurried. He extended his palms like two sharp blades. Chu Feng did not choose to defend against Yan Xie. Instead, he had chosen to fight back. As Chu Feng brandished his two palms, he hacked them down toward Yan Xie’s wrists.

Although they were palms, they were sharper than blades. As the wrist was a frail location, if Chu Feng’s palm strikes were to land, Yan Xie’s hands would be cut off by Chu Feng.

As Yan Xie was an expert, he knew what Chu Feng’s intention was. Thus, upon noticing that the situation was bad, he immediately changed his attack. From palms, he switched to fists and changed his target to Chu Feng’s knife hands. He planned to use his indestructible iron fists to shatter Chu Feng’s knife hands.

Chu Feng knew that Yan Xie’s iron fists were very tough, tougher than his knife hands. Thus, he clenched his fingers into two iron fists and struck them toward Yan Xie’s incoming fists.

“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”

The confrontation between the two pairs of fists created many explosions. The speed of the two fighters was too quick. Fighting at such a close distance, their fists were not even like fists. Instead, they were more like kicks.

However, this was not the important aspect. The important aspect was that the two fighters were both knocked a step back by their opponents after their fists collided with one another. The confrontation of fists ended in a draw.

“Great skills.”

Yan Xie shouted loudly. At this time, he was very excited. After that, Yan Xie waved his sleeve, and boundless martial power began to surge forth. His martial power formed a golden, violently spinning vortex.

That vortex was truly too powerful. Even space was being distorted and shattered by it. Chu Feng knew that this was no longer a simple use of martial power. Instead, it was a martial skill.

Furthermore, this was no ordinary martial skill, it was a Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill on top of that. Yan Xie had finally grown serious.

“Woosh~~~”

Chu Feng moved explosively backwards. At the same time, he clasped his palms together. In an instant, wind, lightning, water, fire and earth, these five different elements, appeared explosively from the surrounding area.

At this moment, Yan Xie’s golden vortex was already about to reach Chu Feng.

However, the five elements also turned into a vortex. They began to revolve around Chu Feng and completely contained him within them.

“Boom~~~~”

The collision of the two martial skills created numerous explosions. Although energy ripples were being emitted all over the place, neither one of the two martial skills were defeated by the other. Instead, like two enormous tops, the two martial skills began to collide onto one another as they spun rapidly in the sky.

The closer the two martial skills grew, the stronger the might of their collisions became. However, as the pressure increased, the golden vortex started to grow weaker. In the end, it vanished like smoke in thin air.

“This...”

Seeing this scene, the crowd from the Yan Clan were all astonished. They never would have thought that it would be Yan Xie’s martial skill that would end up losing in the confrontation.

“Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique.”

However, Yan Xie was not at all discouraged by the loss. With a thought, his clothes began to flutter. At this moment, he no longer appeared to be human. Instead, he was like a God of Fire. Boundless flames turned into enormous waves that could tower over the skies. With a very malevolent snarl, the flames engulfed the entire region as they surged toward Chu Feng.

“Boom~~~”

In an instant, Yan Xie’s Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique collided with Chu Feng’s Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation.

Although Chu Feng’s Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation had managed to win against Yan Xie’s Golden vortex, it had suffered enormous damage in the process. To confront Yan Xie’s Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique, Chu Feng’s Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation was completely inferior. Before the wave upon wave of flames, Chu Feng’s Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation became weaker and weaker.

“Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique,” Right at the moment when Chu Feng’s Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation was about to collapse from Yan Xie’s attack, Chu Feng added another Earthen Taboo Martial Skill on top of his Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation.

Furthermore, this Earthen Taboo Martial Skill he used was none other than the same martial skill that Yan Xie was using right now, the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique.

When the Yan Clan’s Ancestor saw the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique used by Chu Feng, his pupils immediately shrunk, and a surprised expression appeared in his aged eyes. After all, the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique was a martial skill that their Yan Clan never taught to outsiders. How did this Chu Feng know this martial skill?

Seeing that, the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief immediately sent a voice transmission to the Yan Clan’s Ancestor to explain to him what had happened.

“He comprehended the cultivation method of the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique within two hours and then successfully learned it using merely his mind?”

Hearing what the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief told him, shock appeared in the Yan Clan’s Ancestor’s eyes. When he looked to Chu Feng again, a special change had occurred to his gaze.

“Boom~~~”

At this moment, the two seas of flames had long since covered the entire sky. The two flames collided into one another. They were competing with one another to see who would be the actual King of Flames of this region. In that intense confrontation, Chu Feng actually managed to occupy the upper hand.

“Chu Feng’s actually this powerful?”

Seeing that Chu Feng had used their Yan Clan’s martial skill to defeat Yan Xie once again, Yan Ru and Yan Lei were deeply frightened with incomparable shock.

However, compared to the two of them, Dugu Xingfeng, the Yan Clan’s Clan Chief and the others were not shocked by what was happening.

With talent like Chu Feng’s, it was indeed not difficult for him to master a martial skill. As for Chu Feng obtaining the upper hand right now, it was also no coincidence.

Although his Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation was no match for Yan Xie’s Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique, he had still sent it out to block Yan Xie’s Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique. As such, Chu Feng had managed to cancel out a portion of Yan Xie’s Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique.

Afterward, Chu Feng did not dissolve his Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation, and had instead unleashed his own Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique on top of his Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation.

To fight against two Earthen Taboo Martial Skills simultaneously, it would instead be strange if Yan Xie were able to win against them.

Chu Feng was someone that would completely calculate his every move when fighting against others. Each and every step back and each and every step forward were given thought by him.

However, this was something that was very rarely seen among the younger generation. At the very least, Yan Lei, Yan Xie and the others all did not possess this sort of ability.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at this moment, a sudden slash sliced through the sea of flames. It actually managed to forcibly slice the surging sea of flames in two.

That slash was extremely strong. Even Chu Feng did not wish to spend a great deal of effort to receive the incoming slash. Thus, he hurriedly moved to the side to dodge this slash.

“Chu Feng, let’s continue with another bout.”

As Chu Feng dodged the incoming slash, Yan Xie’s body was rapidly approaching him. He was holding a large fiery sword in his hand as he charged toward Chu Feng.

That large fiery sword was a Royal Armament. As for that slash, it had been released by that large fiery sword.

The reason why the slash strike earlier had been so ferocious was because Yan Xie had combined both his Royal Armament and a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill to unleash that slash.

“You’re using weapons? Very well, I shall keep you company.”

Seeing that, Chu Feng smiled lightly. Chu Feng decided not to dodge Yan Xie. Instead, with a flip of his palm, Chu Feng’s Demon Sealing Sword appeared in his hand. Holding the Demon Sealing Sword, Chu Feng charged toward Yan Xie.

“Woosh~~~”

However, at the moment when Chu Feng was about to approach Yan Xie, Yan Xie suddenly waved his arm and threw away the large fiery sword in his hand.

Once that large fiery sword left Yan Xie’s hand, it instantly turned into a fiery ray of light. With layer upon layer of flames, like a fiery dragon, the sword was shot straight at Chu Feng. Its speed was so fast that it was extremely difficult to dodge it.

“Break!” Chu Feng was not to be outdone. Seeing that he was unable to dodge, he decided not to dodge. He tightly held onto his Demon Sealing Sword and waved it. Immediately, a dark black crescent slash swept forth horizontally. Even space itself was sliced in two by Chu Feng’s slash.

As for that large fiery sword, although it was very fierce, it was ruthlessly cleaved in two by Chu Feng’s crescent slash. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Not good,” However, Chu Feng did not display the slightest bit of joy after cleaving apart the large fiery sword. Instead, he started to frown and shouted in his heart.

An enormous danger was about to reach him.
