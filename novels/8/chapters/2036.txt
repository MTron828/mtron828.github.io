Chapter 2036 - Spreading False News

Relying on the masks created by Chu Feng that could track down the people from the Dark Hall, the Ancient Era’s Elves unleashed an all-out counterattack against the Dark Hall.

The Dark Hall’s camps that were gathered outside the various Ancient Era’s Elves’ territories were mostly breached by the Ancient Era’s Elves. Those that managed to defend themselves from being breached would also immediately flee quickly.

At that moment, the people from the Dark Hall all went into hiding.

However, the Ancient Era’s Elves did not stop their attacks on the Dark Hall. After fighting those battles and reversing their fortunes, they turned their focus to the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace.

While it was true that the Ancient Era’s Elves had promised Qing Xuantian that they would not exterminate the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace, the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace were actually working with the Dark Hall. As such, even if they were to not eliminate them, they must still crack down on them.

Merely, when the Ancient Era’s Elves’ army reached the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace, they discovered that all of the elites had left.

Only a group of elders and disciples that did not know the truth remained.

The Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace had become two empty shells. As for the Ancient Era’s Elves, they would naturally not attack those innocent people. As such, they could only drop the matter.

However, in order to prevent their allies from being attacked by the Dark Hall, the Ancient Era’s Elves began to provide reinforcement troops to the Four Great Imperial Clans and the King Monstrous Dragon Race. Only the Underworld Palace, which possessed the strength to defend themselves, did not receive assistance.

However, surprisingly, the Dark Hall was extremely well-behaved. After their massive defeat, they did not show themselves again.

This caused everyone to feel that the Dark Hall had grown afraid. This also allowed the Ancient Era’s Elves to retrieve the sensation of being being absolutely superior, absolutely unrivaled.

However, Chu Feng did not dare to act carelessly. He kept feeling that the Dark Hall had not unleashed their full strength. They had only managed to eliminate the Dark Hall’s camps and kill some Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts and a small portion of the Dark Hall’s experts. They had yet to be able to actually cause harm to the Dark Hall’s strength.

At that moment...

At a location several tens of millions of miles away from the border of the Elf Kingdom was a person. That person fell weakly to the ground. He was a Martial Emperor. Furthermore, his cultivation was not weak. He was a rank three Martial Emperor.

However, he was seriously injured. He was wearing a black cloak and a mask. His outfit had revealed his identity. He was someone from the Dark Hall.

Beside that injured Martial Emperor from the Dark Hall were two other people.

One was sitting on the ground, resting his eyes.

As for the other, she was squatting before that Dark Hall’s Martial Emperor and saying something to him.

As for those two people, they were Chu Feng and the Snow-haired Immortal.

Chu Feng felt that the Dark Hall would definitely not leave the matters as they were. Thus, he had been relying on the masks to search for people from the Dark Hall the entire time. Today, he finally found one.

Merely, after catching this person from the Dark Hall, Chu feng did not do anything to him. Instead, he handed him to the Snow-haired Immortal to take care of.

As for Chu Feng, he was sitting cross-legged on the ground with his awareness cast into his world spirit space.

In his world spirit space, Chu Feng was also sitting cross-legged on the ground. Merely, he was sitting before Eggy.

“Milady Queen, when will you wake up? Even though we appear to be holding superiority in the battle against the Dark Hall, I keep having the feeling that it will not be that simple.”

“If you were here now, it would truly be great. You would be able to analyze things with me and give me suggestions,” Chu Feng said those words not only because he was longing for Eggy. Additionally, he was also feeling uneasy.

They had to win this battle. If they lost, it would definitely be a calamity for the Holy Land of Martialism.

Furthermore, as that Dark Hall’s Hall Master was likely Chu Feng’s fellow clansman, he felt that he had an enormous responsibility in this matter. As such, the pressure on Chu Feng’s heart was enormous right now.

In fact, the pressure that he felt surpassed the pressure the Elf King felt.

“Master, I’ve succeeded. Quickly, come look. I’ve succeeded in unsealing his mask.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Right at that moment, a joyous voice suddenly sounded. Chu Feng hurriedly cast his awareness back into his body. It was then that he discovered that the Snow-haired Immortal was looking at him with a beaming smile on her face.

This woman who was always grim, unfeeling and deemed to be a witch by others actually had a childlike smile on her face. It was also her who had called out ‘master’ earlier.

“Senior Snow-hair, please don’t call me that. I am unqualified to be your master,” Chu Feng shook his head with a smile.

Ever since she had experienced Chu Feng’s various world spirit techniques, the Snow-haired Immortal, that witch who had wholeheartedly wanted to make Chu Feng her disciple, now wholeheartedly wanted to become Chu Feng’s disciple.

She insisted on following Chu Feng wherever he went. Today, the two of them had finally managed to obtain some results and capture a person from the Dark Hall.

With Chu Feng’s current level of world spirit techniques, he was capable of unsealing the self-detonation formation contained within the bodies of the people from the Dark Hall and remove their masks.

And that... was precisely what the Snow-haired Immortal wanted to learn from Chu Feng. Chu Feng had taught it to her. And now... the Snow-haired Immortal had managed to grasp it successfully.

“Okay, I’ll do as you say. After all, you’re already my master in my heart. Regardless of whether you will allow me to call you that, you will still remain my master,” The Snow-haired Immortal smiled again. Then, she moved to remove that Dark Hall’s expert’s mask.

Seeing the Snow-haired Immortal acting like this, Chu Feng sighed in his heart. Back then, she had nearly tormented him to death. In Chu Feng’s heart, the Snow-haired Immortal was an enormous witch to the core.

Yet now, not only was she calling him master on and on, she was also following his every order obediently like a well-behaved girl. The contrast was truly enormous.

“It’s actually someone from the Heavenly Law Palace. Indeed, the Heavenly Law Palace has joined the Dark Hall,” After removing that Dark Hall’s expert’s mask, the Snow-haired Immortal revealed a disgusted expression. The reason for that was because the old man before them was an elder from the Heavenly Law Palace. He had possessed quite a decent status in the Heavenly Law Palace, and had thus met with the Snow-haired Immortal before.

“Speak, what is your purpose in coming here?” Chu Feng asked.

“Wuu~~~” The old man started to shake his head repeatedly. He did not dare to say anything.

“Rest assured, we have already removed the self-detonation formation you have in your body. You can speak the truth now,” Chu Feng said.

“If I am to tell you the truth, will you spare my life?” That old man asked while trembling with fear.

“If you turn a new leaf, I will spare your life. If you are able to provide meritorious service to assist us in defeating the Dark Hall in the future, I will also reward you,” Chu Feng said.

“Little friend Chu Feng, my life and death actually don’t matter to me. I merely wish that you can agree to a condition of mine. As long as you agree to it, I will tell you all that I know,” The old man said.

“Speak,” Chu Feng said.

“Please save my family from the Dark Hall,” As he said those words, the old man’s eyes grew moist.

“Very well, I’ll agree to it. If possible, I will definitely save your family,” Chu Feng nodded.

“In that case, I’ll tell you. Little friend Chu Feng, I was originally going to definitely die by coming here. The reason for that was because I planned to pass news to you,” That man said.

“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am here to tell you all that an ambush lies in wait at the Dark Hall’s headquarters. You all must absolutely not go there,” That old man said.

“What sort of ambush?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am uncertain. My status is very petty and low. I have never even been to their headquarters before. Even the fact that there’s an ambush there is something that I have only heard from others by accident.”

“I have come here with the intention of dying to begin with. The reason for that is because my family are all in the hands of the Palace Master. If I do not die, they will definitely be killed.”

“However, since little friend Chu Feng saved my life, I am willing to turn a new leaf and work for you. But, little friend Chu Feng, you must save my family,” As the old man said those words, he was already weeping bitter tears. He did not appear to be lying. It could be seen that he was deeply worried for his family.
