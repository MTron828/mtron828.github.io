MGA: Chapter 726 - Real or Fake Badge

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the Sentencing Elder understood many of the things that had occurred. She immediately cast her gaze at Chu Feng, and said with an extremely fierce tone, “Since you are not a disciple of the Four Seas Academy, why have you appeared here, and have even come to the forbidden land of the Four Seas Academy? What is your objective?”

“Elder Xu, this person is a friend of my disciple. He has come into the Four Seas Academy to visit her.”

Just at that moment, a Divine Instructor spoke. It was Su Rou’s instructor, and evidently, Su Rou had told her instructor a few things. She stood out and prepared to protect Chu Feng.

“That’s right. He is called Chu Feng, also a friend of my disciple. It was she who brought him here.” Su Mei’s instructor also spoke. After that, Zhang Tianyi’s instructor and Jiang Wushang’s instructor also spoke one another the other, helping Chu Feng escape from this troublesome situation.

“Even so, he should not be here. Does your disciples not know this Millennium Ancient City is a forbidden region? They have actually brought an outsider here! Do they even put the rules of the Four Seas Academy in their eyes?”

That Sentencing Elder was indeed on the same side as Qin Yu. She did not even give Divine Instructors any face, and obviously planned to not forgive Chu Feng and give him a lesson in Qin Yu’s place.

At that instant, everyone who was concerned about Chu Feng hiddenly cursed in their hearts. Not to mention Su Rou and the others, even their instructors’ faces changed slightly and no longer knew how to reply.

That area was indeed a forbidden region. According to the rules, not to mention outsiders, even disciples should not come to that place. The people from the Sentencing Department also had the right over one’s life and death with the rules and laws in their hands. When she asked such a question, they did indeed have no reply.

“Instructors, since your disciples do not know the rules, you should give them a good lesson afterwards. After all, they are geniuses of the Four Seas Academy and also your proud disciples. Looking at both the sentiments and reasons, I believe I should give them another chance. Today, I will not punish them.”

After the Sentencing Elder swept her threatening gaze over Su Rou’s and the others’ Instructors, she then looked at Chu Feng and icily said, “But this child... Today, I will give him a good punishment. Otherwise, if everyone else comes to the Four Seas Academy and acts as they wish, where will the appropriateness be?”

“Elder, it’s not that Chu Feng wants to break the rules of the Four Seas Academy, but really it was...”

“Shut up!

“Do you want to be punished alongside him?”

At that instant, Su Mei wanted to help Chu Feng explain, but before she finished her words, she was yelled back down by the Sentencing Elder.

Seeing that the Sentencing Elder was serious, in order to protect themselves, Su Mei’s and the others’ instructors quickly controlled their respective disciples and prevented them from speaking anymore, in order to avoid being affected by Chu Feng as well and receive punishments.

“Men, take this person to the sentencing prison!” the Sentencing Elder shouted again.

“As you order!” After those words were spoken, from the group of elders, around a dozen or so walked out. All of them had ferocious expressions as they headed towards Chu Feng, and aimed to restrain him.

At that moment, everyone felt Chu Feng was finished. Only Chu Feng himself remained as calm as he was from the start. He opened his palm, then a badge appeared. He flashed it at the crowd, and loudly yelled, “I have Instructor Taikou’s badge. Who dares to touch me?!”

“What? Taikou?!”

When Chu Feng words came out of his mouth, it was akin to a thunder in a clear sky. Everyone was shocked, and the elders who had already neared Chu Feng also halted, not daring to make any rash moves.

As for the Sentencing Elder, she lightly knitted her brows. With a fierce gaze, she stared at the badge in Chu Feng’s hand, feeling that the situation was turning into a bit of a predicament.

Taikou was an anomaly in the Four Seas Academy. Not to mention her, even the head of the academy didn’t dare to easily offend such an existence. How did the seemingly unimpressive boy have Taikou’s identity badge? She couldn’t help but deeply ponder that question. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Senior Taikou’s badge? What a funny joke. Why would Senior Taikou’s badge be so randomly given to you for use?” In that frozen moment, Qin Yu suddenly sneered, then clasped his hands at the Sentencing Elder and said, “Elder, I suspect his badge is fake. Can it be examined?”

“Of course it can.” The Sentencing Elder nodded. In reality, she hadn’t seen Taikou’s identity badge before because he had never needed to show it. Those who saw him were all afraid, so she too did not know whether the badge in Chu Feng’s hand was real or fake.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, she also felt that Chu Feng could possibly be making something up and wanted to pass it as genuine. After all, judging by Taikou’s nature, he would not easily give a person his identity badge. Or, one could say it was impossible he did so.

Thus, the Sentencing Elder looked at Chu Feng, then coldly shouted, “Hand your badge over.”

*whoosh* Chu Feng did not hesitate when he heard those words because he knew his badge was genuine. He did not need to fear them examining it, so, as she spoke, he had already thrown the badge at the Sentencing Elder.

*bam* But who would have thought just as the badge was going to be sent to the Sentencing Elder, Qin Yu suddenly extended his hand and took the badge instead. After roughly glancing over it, he said to the Sentencing Elder in a righteous manner, “Elder, this badge is not Senior Taikou’s identity badge. It is fake.”

“You speak nonsense!” After hearing those words, Chu Feng was enraged. He pointed at Qin Yu and cursed at him because the badge was definitely real. Qin Yu was planning to make Chu Feng look mad.

“Insolent ruffian! Not only do you hold a fake badge and feign to be a person related to Instructor Taikou, you even dare to curse a disciple of the Four Seas Academy!

“Men, destroy this boy’s cultivation first, then nine hundred beatings, then lock him into prison! By the orders of head of the Sentencing Department!” After knowing the badge was fake, the Sentencing Elder restored her former atmosphere.

“By your orders!” As for the elders who were standing around Chu Feng and all ready to pounce on him, they naturally did not hesitate and all of them emanated auras unique to Martial Lords. They planned to make a move on Chu Feng and destroy his cultivation.

“I would quite like to see who dares to touch even a single one of his fingers.” But just at that moment, an old man’s explosive shout suddenly burst out. The deafening sound made the earth continuously shake, as if an earthquake were occurring.

Simultaneously, a single-legged old man appeared before Chu Feng. When he landed onto the ground, a boundless aura was exuded.

The aura swept through the land with great force and it was unstoppable. After only a blink, it blew the elders who surrounded Chu Feng several tens of miles away.

“Instructor Taikou?!”

Such a sudden scene made everyone stunned. And, when they saw the person who showed up before Chu Feng, they were frightened because they could see that the person was none other than the head of the Ten Divine Instructors, Taikou.

“Taikou! Why is he here? Could he truly be somehow related to that boy Chu Feng?

“Impossible, absolutely impossible! I know too clear what kind of person Taikou is. He does not even care about the disciples from the Four Seas Academy, so why does he care about an outsider?”

When they saw Taikou, almost everyone’s complexion changed. The people who were all ready to watch a good show had faces full of surprise and shock. They did not even dare to believe Taikou was truly helping Chu Feng.

As for Su Rou and the others, they had faces of elation because they all knew how powerful Taikou was in the Four Seas Academy. Since he had appeared, today, likely no one could make things difficult for Chu Feng anymore.
