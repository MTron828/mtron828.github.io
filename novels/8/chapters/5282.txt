Chapter 5282: Return of the Long-awaited Power

“Elder, you’re incredible! Are you able to alter the flow of time too?” Chu Feng remarked.

“I’m not the one who is incredible. It’s the Dao of Specialization that has altered the flow of time. I am nothing but its inheritor,” the glowing woman replied.

“That’s still formidable.” Chu Feng could tell that the glowing woman was an amazing individual despite her humble words.

“Don’t try to bootlick me. It’s time for you to make your choice,” the glowing woman said.

The energy from the Dao of Specialization was now inside Chu Feng’s body. He had barely scraped the surface of it, but it was enough for him to mobilize the energy. He knew that he could use the energy to seal off one of the powers in his dantian and specialize in the other.

Naturally, his decision was to seal the Four Symbols Divine Power.

After all, his Heavenly Bloodline was the dominant power that his father had passed down to him, as well as the foundation that had gotten him to his current point. It was just that the Four Symbols Divine Power held special significance to him too, so he didn’t want to just cast it away.

Thus, he asked, “Elder, when will I be able to unlock my Divine Power once more?”

Through his limited understanding of the Dao of Specialization, he could tell that it was possible for him to use the dao laws he had just grasped to seal off the Four Symbols Divine Power, but he didn’t have the power to unseal it.

It would be horrible if he couldn’t unseal the power forever.

“You need not ask me. You’ll feel it when the time comes,” the glowing woman said.

“Four elders, I’m sorry. I promise you that you’ll see the light of the day once more,” Chu Feng murmured.

He sealed off the Four Symbols Divine Power using the dao laws of the Dao of Specialization before moving the dao laws into his dantian.

The energy of the Dao of Specialization was extremely convoluted, so he could only deposit it inside his body for the time being. Based on what he had grasped from it thus far, he was to use the energy to reinforce his control over his Heavenly Bloodline.

Soon enough, a smile emerged on his lips. He had already made some progress.

“Your intelligence is astounding. It looks like I didn’t choose the wrong person,” the glowing woman said.

“Thank you for your pointer.” Chu Feng bowed deeply to the glowing woman.

“Don’t thank me. Thank yourself. You grasped this power through your sheer willpower. Do you know why I gave you nine dao laws?”

“That’s because you trusted me. You saw that my current limit isn’t just eight dao laws but nine,” Chu Feng replied.

“Heh…” The glowing woman laughed. “You’re right to say that your limit is not eight dao laws, but I am a person with principles. I wouldn’t arbitrarily change my decision once I have decided on something.”

“Hm? May I know the reason behind your change of mind then?” Chu Feng asked.

“I am fond of Long Xiaoxiao, but she’s limited by her own talent. I fear that she would be unable to harness the Saint Dragon Legacy and even fall into danger as a result of it, so I prepared two dao laws for her. She had inherited the dao laws alongside you earlier on, but she was only able to take in one due to her lacking willpower. Thus, I gave the other one to you,” the glowing woman said.

“I see!” Chu Feng nodded in realization. “Elder, may I know how I should address you?”

He had asked this question in hopes of knowing her true identity, especially now that he was indebted to her.

“You need not know who I am,” the glowing woman replied.

“Elder, will you continue staying here?” Chu Feng asked.

He knew that the glowing woman had only stayed here to find a fitting successor to the Dao of Specialization. While she had imparted some of its dao laws to him, she still had other dao laws with her.

“You’re the person I am waiting for here. Now that I have met you, there’s no reason for me to remain here,” the glowing woman said.

“Elder, where are you heading to?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s none of your business.”

“Elder, please don’t misunderstand my intention. You have helped me greatly, and I wish to return the favor to you,” Chu Feng said.

“There’s no need for that. It’s my responsibility to ensure the succession of the dao laws, and you have helped me to fulfill my responsibility. We don’t owe each other anything,” the glowing woman said.

“Elder, may I know why you have taken up such a responsibility?”

Chu Feng was curious to know who the glowing woman was and what her goals were.

“You’ll find out if we ever meet again,” the glowing woman said.

Kacha!

Kacha!

Cracks suddenly appeared all over the void, looking like it would shatter at any moment.

“Time’s up. You should return to the real world now.”

As the glowing woman said those words, the surroundings began to warp.

Before Chu Feng knew it, he had already returned to the red tower. Miserable cries of the Totem Dragon Clansmen, whose energies were being devoured by the black chains, filled his ears. He glanced at the incense stick in the distance and saw that it was still the same as before.

Time had indeed stopped.

He had spent nine years taking in the nine dao laws of the Dao of Specialization, but not a second had passed in the real world. Even so, the incense stick was still on the verge of burning out. He didn’t have much time left.

Nevertheless, he still looked outside to check on Long Xiaoxiao. She had fallen into a deep sleep, and fatigue could be seen on her face.

“Is it due to the dao law?” Chu Feng was worried about her.

He had taken in the dao laws too, so he knew just how painful the process was. He was afraid that the experience would traumatize Long Xiaoxiao.

“Chu Feng, where did that woman go? Didn’t she say that she’ll impart to you the Dao of Specialization or something?” Eggy suddenly spoke up.

She had no idea what Chu Feng had just gone through. She only saw the glowing woman offering to impart the Dao of Specialization to him before abruptly vanishing into thin air.

“Eggy, I have already obtained the Dao of Specialization,” Chu Feng replied.

“You have? That’s fast. What’s its use?” Eggy asked.

Not even a second had passed for her during the nine years. She found it hard to believe that something that could be imparted in less than a second would be of much use. Powerful skills tended to require significantly more time and effort to grasp.

Tzlala!

Lightning suddenly crackled behind Chu Feng, spanning an area much larger than the Lightning Armor.

“This is!!!” Eggy widened her eyes in shock. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Through the reflection of the opponent’s eyes, she was able to see the Lightning Mark on Chu Feng’s forehead, the Lightning Armor he donned on his body, and a majestic pair of Lightning Wings on his back. He looked domineering!

“It has been such a long time.” Chu Feng smiled in excitement.

This was the ability he had comprehended from his Heavenly Bloodline through the Dao of Specialization after sealing off the Four Symbols Divine Power—Lightning Wings!

Shoosh!

With the Immemorial Hero’s Sword in hand, Chu Feng charged at the mirror image opponent and defeated him with a single strike.

“Chu Feng, you regained your fighting prowess?” Eggy exclaimed joyously.

Chu Feng’s fighting prowess had diminished considerably due to the rapid breakthroughs he had made previously when he first contracted the Asura World Spirit Army. However, the attack he had just unleashed on the mirror image opponent was clearly much stronger than before.

“I didn’t just regain it. My fighting prowess is stronger than ever,” Chu Feng replied.

This transformation was brought about by the Dao of Specialization, but make no mistake, the Dao of Specialization was capable of much more. After all, Chu Feng had only comprehended a very small portion of it.

He was confident that the nine dao laws within him would surely come to great use in the future.

“Quick, let’s see what’s inside the red box,” Eggy urged.

Chu Feng had reached the peak of the red tower. He picked up the red box and opened it, only to find that it was empty.

“Elder, why is it empty?” Chu Feng asked.

“It’s nothing but a symbolistic token I have casually placed there. I never said that there is something inside the boxes,” the glowing woman said.

“…” Chu Feng’s expectations were let down.

Just then, the incense stick finally burned down. The five towers immediately disintegrated, revealing Liu Kuo and the white-haired woman.

“Eyy, I was just one floor off!” Liu Kuo exclaimed in indignance.

The white-haired woman didn’t say a word, but her awful complexion conveyed that she had failed to reach the top of the tower too.

“My gosh! Brother Chu Feng, y-y-y-y-you succeeded?!” Liu Kuo suddenly exclaimed. He rushed over to Chu Feng’s side to examine the red box in his hands.

The white-haired woman also looked over. Shock could be seen in her eyes when she saw the red box in his hands. She wasn’t able to reach the top of the golden tower, but Chu Feng actually managed to scale the red tower!

“You should thank him. The four of you will be able to live thanks to his help, but the others outside won’t be as lucky,” the glowing woman said.

Chu Feng and the others turned their attention outward and noticed that their surroundings had quietened down considerably. The black chains had stopped siphoning the energy of the Totem Dragon Clansmen.

The deceased were left with shriveled corpses, and those living weren’t faring any better either. The pained howls had stopped, but sorrowful weeping could still be heard. Those with weaker minds amidst the billions of cultivators were unable to tolerate the despair.

“Please, anyone, save us!”

Many people were crying on their knees. While the black chains had only attacked the Totem Dragon Clansmen thus far, they could already foresee their plight.

Feeling pity for them, Chu Feng turned to the glowing woman and called out, “Elder.”

“Don’t look at me. It’s already not easy for me to protect the four of you,” the glowing woman replied.

Chu Feng couldn’t tell whether the glowing woman was telling the truth or not, but it was clear that she had no intention of saving the cultivators outside.

Up in the sky, the demon monk stood before a huge bundle of golden light containing tens of millions of dragon silhouettes. It was the bloodline power that the black chains had siphoned from the Totem Dragon Clansmen.

The demon monk opened his mouth wide and began devouring the golden light. It didn’t take him long to absorb its entirety.

“Hahaha! The Dragon Clan’s Bloodline sure is delectable!” the demon monk roared in delight.

A horn could be vaguely seen on his forehead, but it wasn’t a dragon horn but a wyvern horn. The demon monk wasn’t a human but a wyvern.

“Once I acquire the legacy in the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant and assimilate it, no one in the Totem Dragon Clan will be a match for me anymore. The Dragon Clan will be nothing more than food on my plate!” the demon monk declared.

He turned toward the depths of the black aura in the sky, where a person stood before a cauldron. This person was the one channeling the formation that sealed off the realm.

A sphere containing the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant was floating in front of the person. It was previously in Long Zhen’s possession, but it was stolen from him when his bloodline power was siphoned away by the black chains.

The person was observing the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant via the sphere.

“Brother Ren, how is your progress with the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant? Are you able to open it?” the demon monk asked.

“There’s no need to open it anymore. The true power of the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant is gone,” that person replied.

“Gone? Where did it go?” the demon monk exclaimed in a fluster.

“Someone here must have acquired the legacy.”

“Who could have obtained the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant’s legacy? Is it the Totem Dragon Clansmen?” the demon monk anxiously asked.

“It’s most likely Chu Feng.”

“Chu Feng? Is it that brat? Hahahaha!” The nervous demon monk suddenly burst into hearty laughter. “If that’s the case, all I have to do is to assimilate him.”

“I won’t stop you from killing anyone else, but I won’t allow you to touch Chu Feng,” that person said.

“You won’t allow me to touch Chu Feng?” The demon monk’s expression turned grave. “Brother Ren, what do you mean by that?”

Hu!

The black aura surrounding the cauldron receded, and the person channeling the formation finally appeared in sight. It was a daoist with an ox’s nose.

“Chu Feng is my disciple.”
