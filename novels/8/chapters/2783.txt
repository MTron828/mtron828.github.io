Chapter 2783 - Enormously Furious

“Young master Chu Feng, we’ve heard that you’ve discovered the method to reach Buried Spirit Lake; might it be possible for you to bring us along?” A man from the Starfall Holy Land asked.

Chu Feng had met that person before. However, he had not spoken with him. In fact, when Xia Yun’er was talking with Chu Feng intimately before, Chu Feng had felt an ill-intended gaze from that man.

Yet now, he had a good-natured expression on his face, and was asking Chu Feng to bring them along as if there was a great relationship between them.

That being said, Chu Feng had anticipated this. After all, Chu Feng had tactfully refused many people so far.

Likely, someone had spread news stating that he had discovered the means to Buried Spirit Lake. After that news reached those people from the Starfall Holy Land, they took it to be true.

“Even I didn’t know that I had found the method to reach Buried Spirit Lake,” Chu Feng said.

“Chu Feng, don’t you act so incapable of knowing what’s good for you.”

“It is your honor that we from the Starfall Holy Land have sought you to guide us.”

Seeing that Chu Feng was actually planning to refuse them, the man that had spoken to Chu Feng earlier immediately changed his expression.

“Do not be rude,” however, right after that man spoke, he was berated by Xia Yun’er.

“Young master Chu Feng, I’ve heard that you’ve not only collected the gemstones from the purple trees, but you’ve also collected the flying insects guarding the purple trees.”

“I think you must’ve discovered the secret. Could it be... the secret to Buried Spirit Lake are the flying insects?” Xia Yun’er asked Chu Feng.

“That is what I think to be the case. However, I also do not know whether or not it is correct, as I have not captured a sufficient amount of flying insects,” Chu Feng did not try to conceal anything.

Chu Feng knew very well that Xia Yun’er was an intelligent person. Since she had asked the question, it meant that she must’ve thought that the flying insects were the key.

After all, Xia Yun’er should’ve obtained the same clues as Chu Feng did.

“May I know how many flying insects young master Chu Feng is still lacking?” Xia Yun’er asked.

“I’m still lacking thirteen thousand four hundred and thirty-one flying insects,” Chu Feng answered.

“It just so happens that I have also gathered some flying insects. Young master Chu Feng, how about we attempt to combine our gathered flying insects now?”

As Xia Yun’er spoke, she took out a spirit formation from her Cosmos Sack. Her spirit formation was similar to Chu Feng’s, and it also sealed a great amount of flying insects within it.

Although the flying insects in her spirit formation were much less in number compared to the amount Chu Feng had gathered, there were over a hundred thousand flying insects in there. With those flying insects, Chu Feng would have gathered a sufficient amount of flying insects.

From this, it could be seen that Xia Yun’er had been gathering flying insects for quite a while.

Sure enough, she had also noticed that the flying insects were related to reaching Buried Spirit Lake.

“There’s no need. I can gather them myself,” Chu Feng shook his head.

“What is the meaning of this? Are you implying that we will insist on following you should you use our Holy Daughter’s flying insects?” A disciple from the Starfall Holy Land said.

“Are you saying that you wouldn’t?” Chu Feng asked.

Chu Feng knew very well that as long as he used Xia Yun’er’s flying insects, those people from the Starfall Holy Land would all follow him. In fact... he would lose his authority over the flying insects.

After all, the people from the Starfall Holy Land were a group of unreasonable individuals.

Chu Feng only lacked a small amount of flying insects. Rather than using their flying insects, he could gather the flying insects himself. In that case, he would still have authority over them.

Thus, Chu Feng would naturally not use their flying insects.

“Watch your words! Are you implying that even if you managed to successfully obtain the method to reach Buried Spirit Lake, you would not bring us with you?” Another male disciple from the Starfall Holy Land said.

“That’s right, I’m not planning to bring you all with me,” Chu Feng said.

“Impudent!” That Starfall Holy Land’s male disciple immediately grew furious.

“Impudent? How am I impudent? I’m impudent because I refuse to bring you all with me? Who do you all think you are? Do you think that you’re the Chu Heavenly Clan? Did you think that you all are the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?” Chu Feng asked.

“You...” The Starfall Holy Land’s male disciple turned deep red from anger. However, he didn’t know how to respond.

Actually, he really wanted to put forth the name of their Starfall Holy Land to suppress Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng put forth the name of the Chu Heavenly Clan from the very start. This made it so that he did not know how to reply.

After all, regardless of how powerful their Starfall Holy Land might be, they were still unable to withstand a single blow before the Chu Heavenly Clan.

Since Chu Feng had clearly stated that the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was the Chu Heavenly Clan, if he was to attempt to put forth his Starfall Holy Land’s name to suppress Chu Feng, it would instead be an act of revolt against the Chu Heavenly Clan.

He did not wish to shoulder this. Thus, he naturally would not dare to raise the name of the Starfall Holy Land to suppress Chu Feng.

“Brother Chu Feng, what you’ve said is incorrect. As the saying goes, one should help others.”

“Moreover, we could be said to be acquaintances with one another. What’s wrong with bringing us with you?” Another disciple from the Starfall Holy Land said.

“We are neither relatives nor friends, why must I bring you all with me? I’m sorry but I, Chu Feng, am not a philanthropist.”

“Furthermore, I believe that you all are not philanthropists either.”

“At the very least, when I was gambling with Yuwen Tingyi and the others, none of you all spoke a single word for me,” Chu Feng said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Hearing those words, the expressions of the disciples from the Starfall Holy Land, with the exception of Xia Yun’er, all turned extremely ugly.

Not only had Chu Feng refused them, but he had actually even obscurely mocked their character. As such, how could they not become furious?

As disciples of the Starfall Holy Land, they were beings that would be placed on a pedestal regardless of where they went. When had they ever been treated in such a manner?

“In that case, you are determined to not bring us with you, right?”

At that moment, the disciples from the Starfall Holy Land were all revealing furious and ferocious looks. Judging from their appearances, it was as if they would attack Chu Feng should Chu Feng declare that he would refuse them.

“So what if I am? Could it be that you all plan to attack me?” Chu Feng looked to the Starfall Holy Land’s disciples with a gaze of contempt. There was even a faint smile on his face.

The Starfall Holy Land’s disciple that had asked the question wanted to say something. However, in the end, he swallowed the words he wanted to say.

The reason for that was because they were not confident in being able to defeat Chu Feng in a battle.

After all, they had just witnessed with their very eyes earlier the scene of Chu Feng crippling Yuwen Tingyi’s cultivation.

In terms of strength, all of them combined would not be a match for Chu Feng.

If they were to use force, they would truly not be able to win.

“Young master Chu Feng, you do not have to worry that we will tangle ourselves with you.”

“I, Xia Yun’er, can declare to you here that these flying insects are merely my gift to you. Even if you are to successfully obtain the method to reach Buried Spirit Lake with them, you can still make your own decision as to whether or not to bring us with you. If you are not willing to bring us along with you, I, Xia Yun’er, will definitely not force myself onto you,” Xia Yun’er said to Chu Feng.

At that moment, Chu Feng was once again reminded of how difficult it was to deal with that girl.

Chu Feng’s words were against the Starfall Holy Land the entire time earlier. His words completely enraged those Starfall Holy Land’s disciples.

Yet, Xia Yun’er did not have the slightest bit of reaction to his malicious words. And now, she was saying this sort of thing. It was sufficient to show that she was someone with extraordinary wisdom.

“Miss Xia, I merely do not wish to bring them along. I never said that I do not wish to bring you along. If you want to accompany us, I would not mind at all,” Chu Feng said to Xia Yun’er with a smile.

Even though Chu Feng did not wish to bring Xia Yun’er along, he could not say it. After all, he still owed Xia Yun’er half a favor.

“You!!!”

That said, upon hearing what Chu Feng said, the male Starfall Holy Land disciples were all fuming with rage. They seemed to be shooting flames out of all of their noses, ears and mouths.

Likely, they were nearly about to die from anger because of Chu Feng.

As for Xia Yun’er, she smiled sweetly at Chu Feng’s words. She said, “Since that’s the case, young master Chu Feng should give it a try then.”
