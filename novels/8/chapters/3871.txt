Chapter 3871 - Opened Coffins

Although that long corridor was extremely narrow, the palace hall that appeared before them was extremely vast, and incomparably imposing.

Most importantly, there were two very eye-catching things deep in the palace hall.

They were two coffins!!!

Although it was unknown why the two coffins were placed there, the fact that that place was inside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb and contained coffins was enough to signify how extraordinary of a place it was.

Besides, those two coffins were exquisitely carved and finely decorated. One could tell from a single glance that they were extraordinary items.

The people lying inside those coffins were most definitely extraordinary individuals.

The Mystic Cave Saints guessed that it was very possible that the legendary Great Monster Slayer Emperor was lying in one of the coffins.

“Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.”

“When even the main formation is found, the other treasures are no longer that important.”

The Mystic Cave Saints were extremely excited. After being momentarily stunned, they immediately rushed towards the vast palace hall.

“Buzz~~~”

Right after they set foot into the palace hall, the palace hall started trembling. Following that, an extremely powerful aura emerged from all directions.

That was a spirit formation!!!

They were trapped in the spirit formation.

“What is this?”

After being trapped by the spirit formation, panic immediately replaced the joy on the Mystic Cave Saints’ faces.

In a panic, they all turned their eyes to Chu Feng.

As matters stood, Chu Feng had become their pillar of support.

“I already said that there are only two methods to obtain the treasures of this place.”

“The first method would be to obtain the corresponding keys to the treasures. That would require a lot of effort and time outside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb.”

“As for the second method, it would be to obtain the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s acknowledgement. That would require one to spend time and effort in the tomb.”

“And now, we will most likely be able to obtain that acknowledgement should we be able to breach this spirit formation.” said Chu Feng.

“Brother Asura, we’ll do as you say. Go ahead and instruct us on how to breach this spirit formation.” said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. The others all nodded in agreement too. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Feng did not hesitate either. He first observed his surroundings and studied the structure of the spirit formation.

Then, he sat down cross-legged and began to set up a spirit formation.

Having cooperated twice already, the Mystic Cave Saints were able to cooperate with Chu Feng even better, with better mutual understanding.

With their combined efforts, the spirit formation was soon breached.

“Clamor~~~”

The spirit formation had sealed them like a fort. However at that moment, the barrier scattered downward like water, and then flowed away.

After the spirit formation dispersed, many rays of light started drifting in the sky.

Those firefly-like rays of light were actually talismans. There were a total of thirty such talismans.

They were unable to see through the meaning behind the talismans. However, the aura emitted by them made Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints realize that those talismans should possess special power.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Suddenly, the talismans moved. They turned into rays of light and flew towards Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints.

Ultimately, ten talismans entered Chu Feng’s body, and the remaining twenty entered the eleven Mystic Cave Saints.

This outcome was most likely related to how much they’d contributed to breaching the spirit formation.

This outcome also proved that those thirty talismans were most likely the rewards for breaching the spirit formation.

As Chu Feng had contributed the most, he had obtained the most talismans.

“This feeling. Could it be... with these things in our body, we’ll be able to open the gates those treasures are sealed in?” asked the Mystic Cave Saints. Confusion was present all over their faces.

The reason why they asked such a question was because they were simply unable to sense the power of those talismans.

The Mystic Cave Saints were people that had entered mysterious locations and remnants often. They knew very well that if they gained the power of the main formation, they would be able to exercise magical powers in those mystic locations or remnants.

They had thought that they would’ve been able to gain enormous power in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor’s Tomb after being acknowledged by the main formation. Because of that, they were surprised to discover that they did not feel any power after the talismans entered their bodies.

That was not all. In addition, they also did not know what the use of those talismans was.

“I also do not know what’s going on.”

Chu Feng was also frowning. Although he had managed to determine from the map that they needed to be acknowledged in order to obtain the treasures, the clues he had obtained from the map were truly limited.

It was already remarkable for him to be able to discover that place by relying on the clues.

However, even he didn’t know what those talismans were used for.

“Snap~~~”

“Snap~~~”

Right at the moment when Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were confused, a strange sound was suddenly heard.

As the palace hall echoed, and was capable of restricting one’s perceptive powers, Ch Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to determine where the sound came from right away.

When they finally discovered the source of the sound, their expressions all changed, and their hearts all tensed up.

They were astonished to discover that the strange sound originated from the two coffins located deep within the palace hall.

At that moment, the covers of the two coffins were slowly opening.

As the coffins opened, strange sounds began to be heard from within them.

Those were muffled howls and the sounds of gnashing teeth. The sound resembled that of an evil spirit that had just regained consciousness, and was unable to keep itself from wanting to seek out food.

“Boom~~~”

Suddenly, the covers were sent flying.

Then, an aura as powerful as tides spread forth from the coffins. It rushed towards Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints from all directions.

That aura was simply too powerful. It was so powerful that it’s pressure forced Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints to step back repeatedly.

“Run!!!”

Suddenly, a shriek was heard. That was the Mystic Cave Saints’ Eleventh.

After saying those words, he immediately turned around and started fleeing.

He was not the only one. The others from the Mystic Cave Saints were also fleeing. Even their Eldest brother was no exception.

Their initial reaction was to flee.

The reason for their reaction was because they felt auras that they could not defeat, and intense killing intent from the coffins...
