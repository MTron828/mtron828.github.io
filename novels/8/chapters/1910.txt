Chapter 1910 - Weeping Bitter Tears

At that moment when everyone was talking and laughing, Bai Ruochen asked, “Chu Feng, in that case... did you manage to successfully request the Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flowers?” This was what she was most concerned about.

At that moment, the Compass Immortal, Bai Suyan and Nangong Longjian’s expressions all turned serious. This too was what they were the most concerned about.

“Senior Compass, these are the Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flowers, right?” Chu Feng handed a Cosmos Sack to the Compass Immortal.

“Yes, yes, yes, that’s right. These are Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flowers,” The Compass Immortal was shocked once again. Then, he asked, “But... why would there be this many?”

At that moment, Nangong Longjian asked curiously, “Many? How many?”

“Look,” The Compass Immortal waved his sleeve and took out the one hundred Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flowers in the Cosmos Sack.

“There’s actually this many?” At that moment, not to mention Bai Ruochen and Bai Suyan, even Nangong Longjian revealed an expression of astonishment.

The reason for that was because they were able to tell that the Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flower was an extraordinary medicinal herb just by looking at it. It was most definitely a very precious treasure.

If it was a treasure from elsewhere, they would not be this shocked. However, Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flowers were treasures from the Elf Kingdom. Back then, the Compass Immortal was only allowed to request a single Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flower, and was deemed to never be able to request another. Yet, how did Chu Feng manage to obtain this many at once?

“Little friend Chu Feng, exactly how did you accomplish this? This old man truly feels inferior,” The Compass Immortal said in a joking manner.

“Chu Feng, exactly what happened there? Quickly, tell us about it. I am extremely curious as to what you did in the Elf Kingdom for you to be able to obtain this many Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flowers,” Bai Ruochen asked with a curious expression on her face.

Then, Chu Feng gave a simple account of what had happened in the Elf Kingdom to the four of them. After hearing what had happened, even Nangong Longjian had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.

It seemed to them that the Elf Kingdom was not only filled with arrogant and conceited individuals. There were also Ancient Era’s Elves that were capable of becoming their friends. Merely, it depended both on fate and one’s capability. As for the Elf King, he was willing to befriend Chu Feng because he thought highly of Chu Feng’s capabilities.

Afterwards, Chu Feng immediately began to set up the spirit formation so that they could treat Nangong Longjian’s illness.

This spirit formation was extremely difficult. However, with the assistance of the Compass Immortal, everything went very smoothly. They even managed to set up the spirit formation sooner than they had originally anticipated.

“This spirit formation is truly miraculous. The way I see it, instead of being only possible, this spirit formation will definitely treat Nangong Longjian’s illness.”

At that moment, seeing Nangong Longjian, who was being tempered by the enormous power of the spirit formation while sitting within it, the Compass Immortal revealed an excited expression.

This incurable illness was actually being treated right now. Anyone would become excited should they see this.

“Chu Feng, I truly do not know how to thank you,” Bai Ruochen stood beside Chu Feng. Unspeakable joy covered her face. The gaze with which she looked at Chu Feng was filled with sincerity and gratefulness.

To her, her greatest desire was not reaching the apex of martial cultivation. Rather, she merely wished to reunite with her family.

However, that simple desire of hers had always been an extravagant hope because of Nangong Longjian’s illness.

At that moment, Nangong Longjian’s illness was actually being treated. As for this, it was all thanks to Chu Feng. Naturally, she would be feeling extremely grateful toward him.

“What sort of relationship do we have? We are friends who have gone through trials and tribulations of life and death, together.”

“Senior Longjian is your father. As such, he could be said to be equivalent to being my father too. Naturally, I must cure his illness,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.

He was also very happy. The reason for that was very simple. He was feeling happy at being able to help his friend.

After all, Chu Feng had embarked on the path of martial cultivation and learned world spirit techniques all for the sake of protecting his relatives and friends, so that he could protect their safety and honor.

They all say that dragons possess a forbidden inverse scale. As for Chu Feng, his greatest forbidden inverse scale was the safety and honor of his friends and relatives being infringed upon.

After hearing what Chu Feng said, Bai Ruochen said no more. Instead, she smiled even sweeter. Bai Suyan was also smiling beautifully beside her.

“Senior Compass, I need to go and amend the Blood Devouring Armors. I’ll have to trouble you with this spirit formation,” Chu Feng said to the Compass Immortal.

“Go ahead and take care of what you need to. Although I am unable to set up this spirit formation by myself, as it has now already been set up, this old man is capable of looking after it,” The Compass Immortal said with a smile.

The Compass Immortal smiled a lot. Originally, Chu Feng thought that he was a person with hidden intentions behind his smiles, and felt that he was a very cunning and treacherous individual. After all, he had been played for a fool by the Compass Immortal the first time they had met.

However, looking at the Compass Immortal’s smile now, Chu Feng felt a sense of warmth. The Compass Immortal’s smiles were actually all from the bottom of his heart. Likely, this was what it meant to be a person that was fond of smiling.

Afterward, Chu Feng began to amend the Blood Devouring Armors. Once he started, he did not stop for two entire days.

Actually, two days was extremely insignificant compared to the amount of time the Immeasurable Immortal and the Avaricious Immortal had spent on forging the two Blood Devouring Armors in the first place.

However, in those two days’ time, Chu Feng had brought the Blood Devouring Armors to a higher level of perfection. He was only a bit away from successfully accomplishing his task. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Chu Feng, the situation’s bad!” Right at that moment, Bai Ruochen rushed over in a panic.

Chu Feng stood up and asked, “What happened?” At the same time, he began to use his Heaven’s Eyes to view the outside to investigate what was going on.

Originally, he thought that a problem might have occurred with the spirit formation that was treating Nangong Longjian. However, upon looking, he discovered that there was no problem with the spirit formation at all.

Although the spirit formation treating Nangong Longjian was completely fine, Chu Feng’s expression still changed enormously. He immediately put down the Blood Devouring Armor that he was working on and flew toward the entrance of the cave.

Chu Feng saw two people at the entrance of the cave. One was a Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder. As for the other person, it was actually Jiang Wushang.

Jiang Wushang should have returned to the World’s Hidden Valley with Duan Jidao and the others. There shouldn’t be a reason for him to appear here.

However, not only did he appear here, he had appeared together with a Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder. Chu Feng felt that something bad must’ve happened.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you’ve reached a breakthrough?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, that Nangong Imperial Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elder was immediately shocked.

He knew that Chu Feng was able to kill rank three Martial Emperors back when he was only a rank nine Half Martial Emperor. Now that Chu Feng had become a rank one Martial Emperor, he himself, a rank four Martial Emperor, would likely not be a match for Chu Feng anymore.

However, he didn’t know that Chu Feng had not only reached a breakthrough, but his battle power had also increased by a tier. Not to mention him, a rank four Martial Emperor, Chu Feng would be able to defeat rank five Martial Emperors should he go all-out.

Merely, at that moment, Chu Feng was extremely worried about Jiang Wushang. Thus, he did not bother to pay attention to that Utmost Exalted Elder, and instead directly arrived before Jiang Wushang. He placed his hands on Jiang Wushang’s shoulders and asked in a deeply concerned manner, “Little brother Wushang, what brought you here? Exactly what has happened?”

At that moment, Chu Feng was panicking slightly. Even though Jiang Wushang appeared to be fine, he was able to sense that Jiang Wushang’s state of mind was extremely bad.

“Big brother Chu Feng, I am incompetent, I am incompetent,” After seeing Chu Feng, Jiang Wushang’s face started to twist. Then, he actually crumbled on the spot, and started to tear up. Before everyone, he started to weep bitter tears.

“Little brother Wushang, it’s fine now. Tell me, exactly what happened?” Seeing Jiang Wushang acting like this, Chu Feng began to feel even more distressed. He knew that Jiang Wushang must have experienced something. Else, he who was always strong would not be acting this way.
