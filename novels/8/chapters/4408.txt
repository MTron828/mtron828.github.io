Chapter 4408: So Fast

After that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist began using the black streak to heal his damaged soul. In order not to be interrupted by others, he chose to go into closed-door training.

Fortunately, there wasn’t any problem in the process, and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist successfully recovered from his injuries.

With this, he was finally relieved from his suffering, becoming a healthy man once more.

With everything done, Chu Feng, Yu Ting, and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist prepared to take their leave.

In truth, after Long Xiaoxiao managed to assimilate with the Dragon Vein Source, they should have already left the Dragon Clan. The reason why they remained here was mainly to wait for Chu Feng to return.

Upon hearing that Chu Feng was going to leave, while Long Xiaoxiao didn’t stop him, she told her to wait for her for a while. After that, she quickly rose to the air and left the area, as if rushing away to get something important done.

A while later, Long Xiaoxiao returned with a beautiful middle-aged lady by her side. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This middle-aged lady was dressed elegantly, and she commanded a graceful air around her. Her facial features bore a great resemblance to that of Long Xiaoxiao’s.

Even without outsiders saying anything, Chu Feng could easily figure out that she was Long Xiaoxiao’s mother.

Long Xiaoxiao’s mother was initially imprisoned by the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, but with Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist’s help, she managed to regain her freedom.

Judging from her complexion and her aura, it appeared that she was doing fine at the moment.

In fact, as soon as she saw Chu Feng, a brilliant smile surfaced on her face. Even from a distance away, Chu Feng could already sense her agitation.

“Young master Chu Feng, after hearing so much about you, I’m finally able to meet you.”

Long Xiaoxiao’s mother made no attempt to hide her agitation at all. After she said those words, she began to bow deeply to Chu Feng.

“Elder, you mustn’t! This isn’t appropriate,” Chu Feng exclaimed as he quickly rushed forward to support Long Xiaoxiao’s mother up.

“Young master Chu Feng, if not for you, my daughter and I might not have been able to get through this crisis. It’s thanks to you that Xiaoxiao is able to rise to her current position today. You’re our savior, and there’s no sliver of doubt that you deserve this formality from me,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother said.

“Elder, Princess Xiaoxiao and I are friends, and she has saved my life before. It’s only right for me to repay the favor. You’re being too distant like this,” Chu Feng said.

“Those are two separate matters,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother said as she shook her head.

She seemed to have decided that Chu Feng was their savior, and no matter what was said, she simply wouldn’t change her mind about it.

“Young master Chu Feng, if I may ask, are you in a hurry to leave? If not, I’d like to invite you to remain in our Dragon Clan for a while longer,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother said.

“Elder, I have some matters that I need to attend to. I’ll make sure to pay a visit to you another day,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young master Chu Feng, I understand that a person of your capabilities have your sights set at the wider world out there, so I won’t keep you here. However, there’s one thing that I would like to ask you if it’s convenient.”

Speaking up to this point, Long Xiaoxiao’s mother suddenly paused for a moment. There was a hesitant look in her eyes that was filled with expectations, worry, and nervousness.

“Elder, please feel free to ask me anything.”

Chu Feng realized that the matter Long Xiaoxiao’s mother was going to speak about could be of grave importance from the expression on her face.

“Young master Chu Feng, are you married yet?” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother asked.

“Ah... I have someone whom I love, but we have yet to make our marital vows. My parents aren’t by my side due to some reason, so I’m hoping to wait for them to return before marrying my loved one. I want my parents to witness the ceremony,” Chu Feng replied.

“Oh? Then may I know how many loved ones do you have at the moment?” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother asked.

“Ah... Three of them.”

Chu Feng felt a little embarrassed when he said this number.

It was normal for a man to take in multiple wives in the world of cultivation, but nevertheless, for him to have three lovers when he had yet to officially marry of them, he did think that he was being a little too much of a casanova.

That being said, Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei had been through many difficulties with him. Even though they weren’t officiated as husband and wives yet, Chu Feng had already regarded them as his wives deep in his heart.

“Only three?” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother was surprised.

“Is three very little?” Chu Feng was a little bewildered.

He had never expected such a response from Long Xiaoxiao’s mother at all.

“Young master Chu Feng, a person of your talents is bound to have many suitors. The fact that you only have three lovers is already enough to show that you’re a loyal individual,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother said.

“Elder, please don’t say it in such a way. It’s a little embarrassing.”

Even though Chu Feng’s feelings for Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei were real, he didn’t think that he could be considered to be loyal. After all, loyalty should mean devoting one’s heart to only one person.

Chu Feng knew that while he was not the type to go around flirting with everyone that he saw, he was definitely not considered a loyal individual either.

And in truth, his heart had more than just Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei too.

“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about, young master Chu Feng. You must not know about just how many wives and concubines Xiaoxiao’s father has. If we were to count those who haven’t been given a title yet, it would number up to this.”

As Long Xiaoxiao’s mother spoke, she raised her hand and pointed out eight fingers.

“He has 80 lovers?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s not it,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother shook her head.

“800?” Chu Feng asked once more.

Long Xiaoxiao’s mother shook her head once more before finally revealing the answer, “It’s 80,000.”

“What?! 80,000?!” Chu Feng widened his mouth in astonishment.

He had no idea how he should express his bewilderment at this. He could only remark, “Lord Clan Chief must be overflowing with vigor. I’m in awe.”

“Based on what I know, his lovers can be considered to be few compared to his counterparts,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother added.

“80,000 is considered few?” Chu Feng exclaimed.

“There are even those with 800,000 lovers!” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother nodded.

“Mother! Why are you saying all of this to little benefactor?” Long Xiaoxiao immediately stepped in and tugged her mother’s sleeves.

“It’s normal for men to have many wives,” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother remarked with a chuckle.

“Alright, I won’t stall young master Chu Feng any longer than this. I’ll just get straight to the point then. Young master Chu Feng, would you mind taking in another lover?”

“Another lover?”

Chu Feng was a little surprised to hear those words. Asking whether he minded or not... Well, it went without saying that he wouldn’t mind having another lover, but that person must be able to move his heart first.

If he really met someone he loved, there was nothing in the world that would be able to stop him from pursuing her. On the other hand, if it was someone he had no feelings for, no one would be able to force him into it.

“Young master Chu Feng, if you don’t mind, I hope to betroth Xiaoxiao to you. Are you willing to take her in?” Long Xiaoxiao’s mother said with a smile.

Yu Ting froze on the spot upon hearing those words.

On the other hand, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into laughter.

As for Long Xiaoxiao, who was still holding her mother back from speaking a moment ago, even though her hands were still wrapped around her mother’s arm, she wasn’t saying anything at all. Instead, she had lowered her reddened face, not saying a word at all.

“This is bad. It still came in the end,” Chu Feng murmured in his heart.

He was no fool. He had already realized that Long Xiaoxiao harbored feelings for him, but he didn’t think that she would make a move so quickly.
