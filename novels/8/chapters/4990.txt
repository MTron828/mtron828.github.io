Chapter 4990: I Won’t Allow It

What was on the other side of the spirit formation gate was indeed the outside world.

“Young friend Chu Feng, you’re back. Where’s Yun’er?”

The Godwish Grandmother, the Lady of Dao Sea, and the others quickly rushed over.

While the Godwish Grandmother was confident in Song Yun, she still couldn’t help but feel worried for her. It could be seen just how much she doted on her daughter.

“Elder, Yun’er and the others are right behind us,” Chu Feng replied.

The next moment, Song Yun and Wang Yuxian stepped out of the spirit formation gate. The Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea quickly rushed forward to welcome them back.

However, Song Yun turned to Chu Feng and Zi Ling with an apologetic look on her face.

“Big brother Chu Feng, big sister Zi Ling, I really didn’t do it on purpose. I have no idea how things turned out like that.”

“Lass, no one is blaming you. It’s with your own capability that you were able to obtain a greater share of the soul power,” Chu Feng replied.

Despite saying that he didn’t blame Song Yun, his attitude had visibly gotten much colder. He could tell that Song Yun had resorted to some kind of special means to hasten her absorption of the soul power, suggesting that she had done it on purpose.

After a quick chat, the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea soon understood what was going on.

“Young friend Chu Feng, what are your ties with that lass? If you aren’t close to her, why don’t I slit her throat and force the soul power out of her body?” Shengguang Baimei asked from the shadows.

It was clear from his tone that he was infuriated too.

“Elder, please don’t harm her,” Chu Feng replied.

While he was disappointed with Song Yun, he didn’t wish to harm her.

Chu Feng was intending to leave the place with Zi Ling, but the Godwish Grandmother suddenly asked, “Young friend Chu Feng, do you have urgent matters to attend to?”

“Yes, elder. I do have urgent matters to attend to,” Chu Feng replied.

“You may leave if you’re busy, but you should leave Miss Zi Ling with us,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

“Elder, is there a problem here?” Chu Feng asked.

“I have studied the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound for many years, so I know more about it than you do. The soul power Miss Zi Ling has absorbed from the Monstrous King needs to be cleansed with this treasure. I’m afraid that it’ll take several days at the very least,” the Godwish Grandmother said as she took out an old lantern.

It was a world spiritist treasure from the Ancient Era.

“Elder, I’ve taken a close look at the soul power earlier, and it shouldn’t pose any danger,” Chu Feng replied.

“Young friend Chu Feng, it’s better to be safe than sorry. This treasure serves to cleanse soul power. Since Miss Zi Ling’s illness stems from her soul power, this treasure should be of significant help to her,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

Chu Feng finally relented after hearing those words.

It was indeed better to be safe than sorry. There were quite a few enigmatic factors surrounding the Monstrous King’s Soul Mound, such that Chu Feng couldn’t be sure whether the soul power posed danger to Zi Ling or not. Even if she appeared fine now, there was no guarantee that something wouldn’t happen in the future.

It was better to undergo the cleansing recommended by the Godwish Grandmother. It would only take a few days anyway.

Thus, Chu Feng and Zi Ling decided to stay in the vicinity.

The Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea pooled their strengths together to construct a cleansing formation. Chu Feng wanted to help, but the two of them insisted that there was no need for it. Thus, he spent his time accompanying Zi Ling instead.

While the two of them were resting in their room, Chu Feng asked, “Zi Ling, do you feel anything?”

“I can feel a response coming from the ancient tower. I feel much more comfortable and refreshed than before. I think that my affliction wouldn’t act up at least in the short term,” Zi Ling replied.

“Did the elder in the ancient tower say anything?” Chu Feng asked.

“I tried communicating with her when I absorbed the soul power, but I didn’t receive any response. It’s all my fault. If only I absorbed a bit more soul power, the outcome might have been better than this,” Zi Ling said in self-reproach.

“You’re not to blame. Song Yun used a special means to accelerate her rate of absorption. You couldn’t have won against her. If anything, I am the one who should be blamed. I could have forcefully stopped Song Yun, but I didn’t do so… I hope that you won’t blame me for that, Zi Ling,” Chu Feng said.

“Of course I won’t. If not for you, I wouldn’t have obtained this soul power in the first place. Not to mention, you were the one who put your life on the line and secured the opportunity for me. Big brother Chu Feng, I’m aware of the sacrifices you have made for me,” Zi Ling replied gently. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She walked toward Chu Feng and laid her delicate face on his chest.

Peng!

Someone suddenly kicked the closed doors open.

Chu Feng was angered by the rude gesture, but when he turned his head around to take a look, his anger suddenly quelled.

The person who had kicked down the door was none other than Yaoyao.

“Daddy, daddy!”

Yaoyao ran toward Chu Feng while calling out his name. Paying no heed to Zi Ling, who was in Chu Feng’s arm, she leaped into the air and dived straight into Chu Feng.

Shocked by her action, Zi Ling quickly sidestepped lest Yaoyao hurt herself.

“Daddy? Big brother Chu Feng, this…”

Zi Ling’s eyes widened in astonishment.

“Don’t misunderstand, Zi Ling. This isn’t my child,” Chu Feng quickly explained the situation.

…

Meanwhile, the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea were busy setting up a formation, but their eyes were directed toward Chu Feng’s residence.

“It looks like Yaoyao is really fond of Chu Feng. Don’t you think that Yaoyao would leave with Chu Feng if he decides to take her away?” the Godwish Grandmother asked.

“That’s hard to say. I’ve taken care of Yaoyao for quite some time now. How could she possibly leave with others so easily?” the Lady of Dao Sea replied.

“But what if Chu Feng forcefully takes her away? Are you going to force her to stay?”

The Lady of Dao Sea was rendered speechless by those words, but the Godwish Grandmother wasn't done yet.

“Yaoyao possesses great talent. It’s only a matter of time before she surpasses Lele. I am also very fond of that little lass. That’s why I’m giving you a reminder here. If you intend to keep Yaoyao by your side, you’ll have to get rid of Chu Feng,” the Godwish Grandmother said.

The Lady of Dao Sea didn’t respond to those words, but there was a stir in her eyes. Her expression was also slowly turning cold, frighteningly so.

However, a voice suddenly echoed all of a sudden.

“I should also remind you that I’ll pit my life against anyone who dares to lay their hands on Chu Feng!”
