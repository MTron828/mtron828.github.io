MGA: Chapter 1785 - For One’s Brother, Resolve

“That’s right. I am currently only at the Immortal Fire First Layer Transformation. However, my cultivation has already increased this enormously to my current level.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“As for my father, he has reached the Immortal Fire Second Layer Transformation. Although he cannot be said to be unparalleled in the Holy Land of Martialism, he is still a rare expert.

“As for my ancestor, the Emperor Gong of yore, he had mastered the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation. Having mastered the Tri-layer Transformation, even the Ancient Era’s Elves from that time feared him enormously. During his era, he was truly unparalleled.”

“My father has said that as long as I am able to obtain the title of the Strongest of the Younger Generation, he will help me open up the Second Layer Transformation. As long as I am able to successfully open the Second Layer Transformation, while I will not dare to guarantee other things, I am certain that I will be able to reach the Martial Emperor realm,” After saying these words, Zhang Tianyi showed a face filled with anticipation.

“To reach the Martial Emperor realm directly? What a profound mysterious technique,” Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to admire Zhang Tianyi’s mysterious technique. With the opening of each layer, his cultivation would increase dramatically. This was truly miraculous.

“Actually, the mysterious technique is not that profound. The one that’s powerful is my ancestor,” Zhang Tianyi said.

“Oh? What do you mean by that?” Chu Feng asked.

“Each layer of the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation is more difficult than the previous one. To train in it can be said to be as difficult as scaling the heavens. Back then, my ancestor possessed exceptional talent and managed to steadily conquer the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation to become an overlord.”

“As for us, his descendants, we merely managed to obtain grace from our ancestor,” Zhang Tianyi said.

“Grace from your ancestor? Could it be that your ancestor did something?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. At the same time that my ancestor mastered the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation, he also realized how difficult the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation was. In order to help his descendants master the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation successfully, he used a special method to pass on his strength.”

“When his strength is combined with the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation, his descendants will be able to reach a breakthrough rapidly. Compared to having his descendants train in the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation themselves, this method is much easier,” Zhang Tianyi said.

“So that’s the case. Your ancestor was truly a thoughtful person,” Chu Feng said.

“That’s right. With my ancestor’s ability, he should have been able to live for over ten thousand years or even longer. However, in order to preserve his power for the benefit of his descendants, my ancestor died before he reached five thousand years old,” Zhang Tianyi said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng was surprised. Evidently, Emperor Gong had sacrificed himself for his descendants. That sort of spirit was truly rare to come by.

“Not only that, my ancestor also left behind instructions. For the sake of allowing our clan to continue on, all those who are able to master the Tri-layer Transformation are to use the same method to preserve their power to benefit their descendants during their peak,” Zhang Tianyi said.

“This...” Chu Feng was at a loss of words. While Emperor Gong’s spirit was worthy of admiration, his request truly made things difficult for his descendants.

No matter what one decided to do oneself, it would be fine. However, to force others to do the same would always be wrong.

Furthermore, those who managed to master the Tri-layer Transformation were all qualified to become overlords. Who would be willing to sacrifice themselves at their pinnacle for the benefit of others?

Unable to contain himself, Chu Feng asked, “In that case, has there been anyone who has managed to master the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation?”

“While my ancestor left behind the method, only the ones with the strongest talent in our clan are qualified to receive his power. That is why there’s me, an eighth generation successor.”

“However, the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation is simply too difficult. Even though my ancestor sacrificed himself, the majority of his descendants were only able to reach the Immortal Fire Second Layer Transformation.”

“From the day of my ancestor’s death till now, we have had a total of eight generations of successors. Among them, only one senior was able to master the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation.”

“Unfortunately, that senior had been born at the wrong time. Although he had mastered the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation and obtained the same might as my ancestor, he was coincidentally born into the same era as Emperor Qing.”

“Emperor Qing?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression changed.

“That’s right, it was that Emperor Qing, the same Emperor Qing that was deemed to be the strongest of the Five Emperors. Before him, no one would dare to declare themselves to be Emperors.” When mentioning this matter, Zhang Tianyi had an expression of regret on his face.

As for Chu Feng, his heart was also moved. He was able to guess who the senior that Zhang Tianyi mentioned was. Likely, he was the same person who had left his strand of aura behind in the Sealing Ancient Village.

“The might of Emperor Qing is merely a rumor. Why are you so certain that that senior from your clan was inferior to Emperor Qing?” Chu Feng asked.

“The two of them fought each other privately before. Although that battle was very hidden and, no one else other than my clan’s senior and Emperor Qing knew about it, you should know how the battle concluded even without me saying it,” Zhang Tianyi said.

“I understand now,” Chu Feng really understood. Evidently, the battle had concluded with Emperor Qing’s victory. Else, that era’s overlord would not have been Emperor Qing. Instead, it would have been that senior Zhang Tianyi had spoken of.

“After that senior was defeated by Emperor Qing, he bitterly trained for some time in order to try to defeat Emperor Qing again. Unfortunately, Emperor Qing became stronger and stronger. He reached a state where he could not be contended against.”

“Unable to see a hope of defeating Emperor Qing anymore, that senior followed my ancestor’s instructions and sacrificed himself to pass on his strength. Unfortunately... the later generations all failed to master the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation,” Zhang Tianyi said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng also felt regret for the Zhang Family. However, more than that, he pondered exactly how powerful Emperor Qing was back then.

He was actually able to make someone who had mastered the Immortal Fire Tri-layer Transformation give up all hope?

“Senior brother Zhang, in that case, you must absolutely win the competition tomorrow?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s right. However, this is not my father deliberately making things difficult for me. Rather, it is the rule left behind by my ancestor. According to my ancestor’s rule, only those younger than a hundred, and those who are the strongest of their younger generation in our clan can use his power to open the Immortal Fire Second Layer Transformation.”

“Else... they must use their own strength to defeat all of their fellow members of the younger generation from the Holy Land of Martialism,” After Zhang Tianyi said those words, he looked to Chu Feng and said, “Junior brother Chu Feng, when we were planning to leave for the Eastern Sea Region, we fought one another in the Azure Dragon School.”

“I was defeated by you in that match. After that, the distance between us grew further and further. I had thought that I would not have the opportunity to fight against you again.”

“However, to my surprise, my ancestor has given me the opportunity to fight you again. Truth be told, what I look forward to the most is being able to fight against you again. Regardless of victory or defeat, it is still what I wish for.”

“I’m also looking forward to it,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“Oh, that’s right. Junior brother Chu Feng, we will get to choose our opponents in the battles tomorrow. You must not select that devil woman Leng Yue as your opponent. You must definitely leave her for me.”

“Although I cannot kill her, I must make her have a taste of her own medicine, make her suffer the same humiliation that she made little brother Wushang and me suffer.”

After finishing saying those words, Zhang Tianyi’s gaze turned complicated. It was as if the scene of the humiliation was right before his eyes.

“What percentage of certainty do you have in defeating that Leng Yue?” Chu Feng asked.

“Truth be told, I only have a fifty percent certainty,” Zhang Tianyi said with a bitter smile. “While our cultivation and battle power might be the same, her techniques might not necessarily be inferior to my own. I can only say that I have a fifty percent chance of victory. However, even with that being the case, I must still defeat her.”

“You will,” Chu Feng patted Zhang Tianyi’s shoulder with a smile.

While Chu Feng said those words with his mouth, he was thinking in his heart, ‘Senior brother Zhang, it is very likely that Leng Yue does not possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, but instead one that is capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.’

“Junior brother Chu Feng, the competition will begin tomorrow. We brothers can continue to chat with one another slowly. For today, it is better that we properly rest ourselves.”

“Oh, that’s right. You must not go easy on me tomorrow,” Zhang Tianyi said.

“Definitely,” Chu Feng nodded.

After Zhang Tianyi left, Chu Feng had an expression of worry on his face. He was at a loss as to what to do. He had not expect that the competition tomorrow would be this important to Zhang Tianyi.

After a while, Chu Feng smiled a relieved smile. It was as if he had come to a decision.

“Hey, fool, what are you thinking about?” Right at this moment, a pleasant-sounding voice suddenly sounded in Chu Feng’s ears.

Hearing this voice, Chu Feng was overjoyed. “Eggy, you’ve woken up?!!!”

“Rubbish, if I’m not awake, who’s talking to you?” Eggy said with a mischievous laugh.

Hearing this familiar teasing, Chu Feng was even more overjoyed. With a thought, he cast his consciousness into his world spirit space.

Sure enough, the beautiful woman was standing there with an attractive posture and a smile on her face as she looked at him.
