Chapter 4438: I Can Testify Too

“Brother Bao and Brother Kui, I’ll be troubling the two of you then,” Chu Feng clasped his fist at the two of them as he spoke.

“Brother Chu Feng, you don’t have to worry! We’re here to redress your grievances!”

At this point, Bao Yue and Kui Wudi turned their gazes toward the crowd.

“We can testify that everything happened just as Miss Long said. As for everything that Yin Daifen and Fu Feiyue had said, they are all lies fabricated by those two to frame Chu Feng.”

As if fearing that someone would fail to hear their words, Bao Yue and Kui Wudi spoke with a particularly resounding voice.

“You can’t believe their words! They are in cahoots with one another!” Yin Daifen exclaimed with a wronged look.

“So what if we’re in cahoots with one another?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster asked domineeringly.

Compared to Bao Yue and Kui Wudi, the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster seemed to fit into the mold of a monstrous beast more aptly. His appearance or speech gave out a menacing aura that few humans could compete with.

“Can I take this to say that the Monstrous Herd Temple intends to go against our Cloudsky Immortal Sect?” the powerful voice of an elder sounded from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s war chariot once more. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Your Cloudsky Immortal Sect doesn’t mean shit before my eyes! That’s right, I’ll be backing young friend Chu Feng today. What are you going to do about it?”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster flung his sleeves coldly as he emanated his oppressive might toward those from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.

“Hahaha!”

But despite the provocations from the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, a peal of hearty laughter sounded from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s war chariot.

It was the laughter from the elder who had spoken earlier on. After his laughter came to an end, another powerful oppressive might burst forth from within the war chariot.

Astonishingly, he actually managed to fend against the oppressive might coming from the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster!

“You’re the sectmaster of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster asked deeply.

He could already sense that the other party’s cultivation was not beneath his in any way.

“We don’t need our sectmaster to deal with someone of your caliber! I am Supreme Elder Zhao Chunqiu of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect!” the elder’s voice sounded from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s war chariot.

As soon as the elder from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect revealed his identity, the faces of everyone, including the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, Long Xiaoxiao’s mother, and Long Busheng, warped in shock.

Even Chu Feng couldn’t conceal his astonishment too.

The strength of the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster was comparable to that of the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief, but just a mere Supreme Elder of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was already able to stand on equal ground with the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster.

Wouldn’t this mean that the Cloudsky Immortal Sect’s sectmaster would be even stronger than that?

Could it be that the newly arising Cloudsky Immortal Sect was already stronger than established powers such as the Dragon Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple?

This unexpected revelation caused the tables to be turned once again.

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster didn’t make a move anymore after this. It was clear that he was weighing the pros and cons of standing against the Cloudsky Immortal Sect for Chu Feng.

In the end, Chu Feng was merely an outsider to him. Was there really a need for the Monstrous Herd Temple to offend a powerful organization for his sake?

“Allow me to give the Monstrous Herd Temple a word of advice. Don’t get involved in this matter for the sake of that lad. You won’t be able to save him!”

Another foreign voice suddenly sounded at this moment.

Following that, a blinding golden radiance scattered down from the clouds above.

If one were to take a closer look, one would be able to see many figures riding atop massive birds surfacing amidst the golden radiance.

There had to be at least several thousand people there.

Amidst the thousands of people, there was a middle-aged man that stood at the forefront with an air of regality.

Along with his appearance came a powerful pressure that didn’t pale in comparison to the oppressive might released by the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster in any way.

On the massive bird that he was riding on, there were two other figures standing beside him—Yu Hong and Yu Yin.

“Even the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief is here too? Do you intend to pick against young friend Chu Feng too?” the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster asked.

His words revealed to Chu Feng the identity of the middle-aged man who emanated an air of regality—the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.

However, Chu Feng was not surprised by this turn of events at all.

After all, compared to Yin Daifen and Fu Feiyue, Yu Hong did suffer more under him.

Given Yu Hong’s personality, it was impossible for him to not try to exact vengeance on him.

“Pick against him? We’re just here to seek justice,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief harrumphed coldly before directing a cold glare toward Chu Feng.

His eyes were filled with ferocity, and it heaped great pressure upon Chu Feng.

Had it been any other ordinary human in Chu Feng’s place, such a glare could have caused him to faint on the spot. Yet, Chu Feng stood unfazed. He looked back at the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief without any fear in his eyes.

Seeing how Chu Feng actually didn’t fear him, the rage in the eyes of the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief intensified.

“Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, young friend Chu Feng is a good friend of my daughter. I don’t know what kind of grudge you have with young friend Chu Feng, but I don’t think it’s appropriate for someone of your standing to lead your men here to deal with him. Don’t you think you’re going overboard?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked sharply.

“That little scoundrel dared to steal the possessions of a member of our Yu Heavenly Clan. It’s only right for our Yu Heavenly Clan to address such arrogance directed toward us properly,” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief replied.

However, as compared to the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster, the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was much more polite when addressing the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief.

From his attitude, it wasn’t hard to deduce that he was unwilling to cross hands with both the Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief simultaneously.

“Steal? Is that what Yu Hong said?” Chu Feng asked.

“Chu Feng, what’s going on? Did you really steal the possessions of a member of the Yu Heavenly Clan?” the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief asked Chu Feng.

He couldn’t just blindly protect Chu Feng. He needed to clarify the truth first in order to ensure that he had the moral high ground here.

After all, stealing the possessions of a member of the Yu Heavenly Clan was no trifling matter.

“Father, don’t listen to their nonsense. That isn’t the case at all! Yu Hong was the one who begged little benefactor to accept his Cosmos Sack!” Long Xiaoxiao exclaimed indignantly before Chu Feng could even speak.

“Ridiculous! Do you take us as fools?” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief roared furiously.

Even the air around him seemed to quiver when he spoke. It was clear that he was truly enraged.

The Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was also frowning slightly after hearing those words. Even he found it hard to believe what Long Xiaoxiao had just said.

Meanwhile, the others from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect sneered coldly in response.

They might have just doubted Yin Daifen and Fu Feiyue’s words a moment ago, but after hearing Long Xiaoxiao claiming that Yu Hong had begged Chu Feng to accept his Cosmos Sack, they immediately became convinced that Long Xiaoxiao was lying.

How could Yu Hong, a prodigy of the Yu Heavenly Clan, possibly do something so foolish as to beg a stranger to accept his possessions?

“It’s not a lie but a fact. We were present and can testify on Brother Chu Feng’s behalf!” Bao Yue suddenly spoke up at this moment.

“I can testify too!” Kui Wudi added.

“The lot of you are in cahoots with one another, so what credibility do your words have?” the Yu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sneered coldly.

Putting aside them, even the Dragon Clan’s Clan Chief was feeling deeply skeptical about this whole issue.

“I can testify for it too.”

It was at this moment that yet another voice sounded. A figure suddenly materialized beside Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao.

Upon seeing the figure, ravenous joy exploded on Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao’s faces.

The person who had appeared was no ordinary figure. She was the old woman whom they had met earlier in the Godwish Palace, the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother!
