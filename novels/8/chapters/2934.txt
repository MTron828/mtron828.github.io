Chapter 2934 - Dying Of Explosion

“Wuuu~~~”

Suddenly, another person inside the fog started to reveal an extremely painful expression. In fact, he even began to scream loudly in pain. It was as if he were enduring some sort of inhumane, brutal torture.

Seeing this, the surprise on the crowd’s faces grew even more intense. The reason for that was because the person that was screaming in pain was not an ordinary member of the younger generation. He was someone ranked on the Demon-level Geniuses List.

He was Ren Xiaoyao.

After Ren Xiaoyao began to scream in pain, Chu Huanyu’s handsome face also started to distort.

Although Chu Huanyu was not screaming painfully like Ren Xiaoyao, he was still groaning nonstop.

This meant that while his situation was a bit better than Ren Xiaoyao’s, it was not very optimistic either.

Following that, even Song Yunfei and Chu Ruoshi, the two people that could be said to be the strongest among the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generations, also started revealing a painful expression.

“Puuu~~~”

Suddenly, someone vomited a mouthful of blood. Following that, a ‘bang’ was heard, and that person actually exploded.

That was a disciple from the Starfall Holy Land.

“This!!!”

Seeing this, the tongue-tied crowd were no longer capable of remaining calm.

After all, dying inside the crimson fog was simply too frightening.

That said, the person who died in the crimson fog was only the first to die.

After him, many other Starfall Holy Land disciples exploded and died. In fact, there were even two people from the Chu Heavenly Clan that also exploded and died.

All their clothes and treasures were completely undamaged. It was merely their bodies that were completely annihilated, and turned into watery blood that was assimilated into the crimson fog.

“Heavens! How could the crimson fog this time around be so frightening?!”

“Could it be that all of the geniuses that have entered it will end up dying inside?”

At that moment, many people were unable to remain calm. One must know that whilst the crimson fog had been extremely powerful, it had never been as frightening as it was at that moment. After all, the people that had entered it were within the age limit.

In short, the crimson fog at that moment was simply too strange.

At that moment, the crowd all turned their gazes to Chu Feng. Their gazes were filled with complicated feelings.

Earlier, Chu Feng’s declaration that he was purely feeling danger out of intuition had caused many among the the crowd to feel it to be ridiculous.

It was only now that they realized that Chu Feng’s intuition was actually extremely accurate.

Chu Feng had not refused to enter the crimson fog because he was a coward. Rather, it was because he was wise and sensible.

It was not only Chu Feng who was wise, Xia Yun’er and Chu Lingxi who believed in Chu Feng were also very wise.

At that moment, Xia Yun’er was also looking at Chu Feng. Her gaze was filled with gratefulness.

The reason for her gratefulness was naturally because she did not enter the crimson fog because of Chu Feng’s warning.

That Illusory Blood Lotus was simply too frightening. If she had entered it too and was unable to withstand the illusions, she too would end up suffering a calamity.

“Everyone, let us stop enjoying the show now and think of a way to save them. We cannot ignore them like this.”

“Those people of the younger generation are all our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s future hopes. We cannot look on as they lose their lives in there.”

At that moment, an aged old man began to ask the crowd to think of a way to save the people of the younger generation that were currently suffering in the crimson fog.

Actually, he was not the only person that was worrying for Chu Ruoshi and the others.

Even though they were completely unrelated, there were still people who were worried about Chu Ruoshi and the others.

It was as that old man had said, Chu Ruoshi, Song Yunfei and the others were the future of their Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. They were the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s hope.

If they were to all lose their lives in the crimson fog, it would be an enormous calamity for the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

“Boom~~~”

Right at that moment, an enormous power emerged from the void. That power started to pour into the crimson fog and began to fight against it.

Someone was trying to forcibly rescue the people inside the crimson fog.

“This aura, it’s a peak Martial Immortal.”

The crowd were all astonished. Even though the person that had acted did not reveal themself, the crowd were able to sense their aura.

Furthermore, the crowd were able to guess that person should be either a guardian of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations or a guardian of the Starfall Holy Land’s younger generations.

After all, geniuses like Chu Ruoshi, Song Yunfei and Chu Huanyu would always have powerful experts protecting them from the shadows.

The reason for that was because the world of martial cultivators was simply too dangerous. If those people of the younger generation were to be allowed to travel through the dangerous martial cultivation world without any protection, they would soon encounter dangers. Thus, it was necessary for powerful experts to secretly protect them from the shadows.

At that moment, the expert that was secretly protecting them, regardless of whether he was from the Chu Heavenly Clan or the Starfall Holy Land, had acted. As such, the crowd’s worry toward the younger generations inside the crimson fog had lessened a bit.

Right at that moment, the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said unhurriedly, “It’s useless. The Illusory Blood Lotus is extremely powerful. Even a rank one Exalted wouldn’t be able to breach it.”

There were immediately people that felt that he was trying to scare others upon hearing his words.

As one of the few peak experts present, not only did the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master not lend a helping hand, but he even said this sort of demoralizing thing. They felt that what the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master was doing was truly wrong.

However, the crowd soon realized that what the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said was actually not a scare tactic. Instead, there was actually a basis to it.

The reason for that was because that peak Martial Immortal was increasing his power output nonstop. However, he was still unable to completely penetrate the crimson fog, much less saving Chu Ruoshi and the others.

“Senior, what should we do then?” Xia Yun’er turned to ask the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master.

No matter what, there were disciples from the Starfall Holy Land trapped inside. Thus, she wanted to know how to save them.

“They will have to depend on themselves. The duration of the illusion is limited. When the time is up, they will be able to escape the crimson fog.”

“However, as to whether or not they will be able to last until then, will depend on themselves,” the Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master said.

After hearing those words, Xia Yun’er turned her eyes to Elder Xingyi.

“That is indeed the case. There is no other alternative apart from that,” Elder Xingyi slowly said.

Many among the crowd heard what the two of them said. They all believed in their words very much. However, the worries in their hearts remained all along.

Although the explosions from people dying had stopped, the younger generations inside the crimson fog were still in fatal danger.

At that moment, apart from Chu Ruoshi, Song Yunfei and Chu Huanyu, all the others inside were already bleeding from all seven of their facial orifices. Their complexions had turned deathly pale, and their bodies were trembling violently.

They had the appearance of people that would explode and die at any moment.

In fact, even Ren Xiaoyao, that genius on the Demon-level Geniuses List, was bleeding from his nose nonstop.

Although he did not look as miserable as the other people of the younger generation inside, his unceasingly bleeding nose and his slightly trembling body made the crowd realize that this genius on the Demon-level Geniuses List was on the verge of collapse too.

“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”

Finally, those people of the younger generation trapped inside the crimson fog started to lose their flying ability. In the same order that they had entered the crimson fog, they began to break free from the crimson fog and fall toward the ground.

At that moment, not to mention the experts from the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Starfall Holy Land that were hiding in the shadows, the crowd present had all begun to release gentle martial power to catch the people of the younger generation that were falling to the ground and prevent them from crashing to the ground.

Soon, apart from the people that had died with their bodies exploding inside the crimson fog, all the other people from the younger generation had managed to escape the crimson fog.

The great majority of them had fallen unconscious.

Only Chu Ruoshi, Song Yunfei, Chu Huanyu and Ren Xiaoyao immediately woke up upon escaping from the crimson fog.

The four of them did not rely on others’ help, and stood in midair with their own strength. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The fact that the four of them immediately woke up upon escaping from the crimson fog already proved how extraordinary they were.

That said, the four of them, to a greater or lesser degree, had ugly expressions on their faces.

After all, they were representatives of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generations.

They had entered the crimson fog with a desire to prove themselves. However, the result made them feel extremely humiliated.

That said, no one actually felt that they were humiliated. After all, the crowd had all witnessed how frighteningly powerful that crimson fog was.

The crimson fog at present was truly different from usual. It was much too strange.
