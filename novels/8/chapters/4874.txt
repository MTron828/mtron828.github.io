Chapter 4874: Unbelievable Means

“He does have special means.”

In contrast to the astonished spectators, Chu Feng stared at Shengguang Xuanye with a deep frown on his forehead. He had known beforehand that Shengguang Xuanye was at rank six Martial Exalted level, and that was the reason why he executed First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance right from the start, intending to curb his enemy with a single strike.

This attack should have been more than enough to kill Shengguang Xuanye, and the attack did manage to tear the latter’s flesh apart. However, the truth was that the attack didn’t pose a threat to the latter’s life at all.

There was some sort of power inside Shengguang Xuanye’s body that was helping him offset the force of the attack. It should be his survival means.

“Damn it, it’s setting in so quickly!”

Chu Feng’s face started turning pale as a mixture of frailty and pain swept through his body. Even standing was starting to become difficult for him.

Klang!

Chu Feng fell to his knees in the sky, and he could only barely sustain himself with the support of the Immemorial Hero’s Sword. Otherwise, he would have already fallen straight to the ground.

“What’s wrong with Chu Feng?”

The crowd swiftly noticed that there was something amiss with Chu Feng’s state.

Naturally, his condition was the result of him using the First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance.

Shoosh! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Chu Feng reached into this Cosmos Sack, took out a huge bundle of medicine, and swallowed all of them at one go. Then, he waved his hand grandly.

Shoosh!

The Holy Light Clan’s robe that he wore was shredded into pieces, revealing the clothes he was wearing underneath. At the same time, the Lightning Mark on his forehead, the Lightning Armor around him, and the Four Symbols Divine Power coiling around him were finally revealed.

The crowd could finally sense his aura.

“Rank five Martial Exalted level! Chu Feng’s cultivation has reached rank five Martial Exalted level!”

“Did he raise his cultivation using his Heavenly Bloodline and Divine Power, or has he really reached such a high level in his cultivation?”

The crowd began gossiping amongst themselves.

They hadn’t seen Chu Feng’s cultivation before he used his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor, so they couldn’t tell exactly how powerful he was.

However, even if Chu Feng had reached rank five Martial Exalted level, it shouldn’t be possible for him to defeat Shengguang Xuanye with a single strike. One must know that Shengguang Xuanye was a rank six Martial Exalted level cultivator!

The crowd noticed Chu Feng’s powerful cultivation, but they didn’t notice how his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor were starting to weaken. He was becoming unnaturally feeble, as if his energy was being drawn back into his body.

Chu Feng himself also closed his eyes quietly.

“Ki ki ki!”

A series of chilling laughter sounded from Shengguang Xuanye’s direction.

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and the others felt a clench in their hearts.

Shengguang Xuanye had risen back to his feet. His body was covered in injuries, but the terrifying lightning that was searing his body had completely vanished. His aura had weakened significantly, but it looked like his vitals were still intact.

Shengguang Xuanye still had enough strength in him to fight back.

“It’s no wonder why you dare to challenge me. You do have some means. However, it looks like your skill takes quite a burden on your body too,” Shengguang Xuanye sneered.

“Heh...”

Chu Feng let out a scoff before slowly rising back to his feet.

Lightning started crackling from his eyes before spreading all over his body, including the Immemorial Hero’s Sword he was wielding.

At the same time, storm clouds set in from all around and covered the sky. These storm clouds were filled with the terrifying lightning that had ravaged Shengguang Xuany’e body earlier, just that the quantity was far greater than before.

“That protective treasure of yours should have already worn out by now. I wonder if you’ll be able to take this attack from me with your own strength,” Chu Feng remarked coldly.

“Despite your severe injuries, you still want to resort to such forceful means. It looks like you’re planning to trade your life for mine. However, you should know that I have only gotten careless earlier on. Did you think that your means will work on me a second time?”

Aura started pouring out of Shengguang Xuanye’s body. It was the bloodline ability of the Holy Light Clan!

Shengguang Xuanye’s cultivation began to rise all the way to rank seven Martial Exalted level.

“This is bad. Chu Feng is a goner now!”

The crowd looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with worry.

It was amazing that a junior like Chu Feng was able to reach rank five Martial Exalted level, and everyone acknowledged his strength. However, his opponent was simply stronger than him.

Shengguang Xuanye was at rank seven Martial Exalted level, two ranks above Chu Feng. No matter how terrifying the lightning Chu Feng had summoned looked, he couldn’t kill the rank six Martial Exalted level Shengguang Xuanye with it earlier. Given so, how could he expect to defeat the strengthened Shengguang Xuanye?

“It’s all over, Chu Feng!!!”

Shengguang Xuanye released a punch in Chu Feng’s direction. It was just a normal punch filled with martial power, devoid of any martial skills and the sort. Yet, its prowess had already surpassed Chu Feng’s Heavenly Lightning Slash.

“Hmph!”

However, the moment Shengguang Xuanye made his move, a bolt of lightning fell from the sky and struck down on his martial power. The two forces collided with one another, and astonishingly, the bolt of lightning actually destroyed Shengguang Xuanye’s martial power.

The outcome came as a shock to Shengguang Xuanye.

No, it would be more accurate to say that everyone was shocked by it.

It turned out that the lightning in the sky had already started to morph into a humongous lightning beast. This lightning beast was so huge that it was impossible to estimate its size, as if it had taken up the space of the entire world all by itself.

However, what was more shocking was the aura it was emanating. Even Shengguang Xuanye was horrified by it.

Its aura actually overpowered Shengguang Xuanye, meaning that it was more powerful than him!

“Pu!”

Chu Feng spurted a huge mouthful of blood before falling to his knees once more.

“This is bad. His martial skill is formidable, but the burden is equally great too. Young friend Chu Feng won’t be able to hold on!”

The Monstrous Herd Temple’s sectmaster and the others were worried.

In contrast, Shengguang Xuanye was delighted to see Chu Feng’s current state.

“Hmph!’

With a cold harrumph, Shengguang Xuanye released another palm strike.

Grar!

This palm strike morphed into a gigantic beast of martial power that towered at a height of over ten thousand meters as it raced toward Chu Feng. It wasn’t just an ordinary strike but an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.

Shengguang Xuanye was afraid that complications might occur if he were to drag things out, so he went with a killing blow instead.

Boom!

However, another lightning bolt descended from the sky and tore the Exalted Taboo Martial Skill with utmost ease.

“This isn’t good.”

Shengguang Xuanye looked at the lightning beast in the sky and Chu Feng’s current state, and he suddenly felt a bad premonition.

He knew that Chu Feng was already weakened to a point where it was no longer possible for him to control the lightning beast anymore, which meant that the lightning beast was protecting Chu Feng on its own accord.

Nevertheless, Shengguang Xuanye didn’t give up just like that. He whipped out an Exalted Armament spear and launched another series of attacks on Chu Feng.

His attacks grew stronger with each one dished out, but the lightning beast was able to destroy all of them without fail.

“How formidable! What is that skill? It doesn’t seem like a martial skill. Could it be a secret art? But even secret arts shouldn’t be that powerful!”

Even the crowd could tell that the terrifying lightning beast was protecting Chu Feng on its own accord by now.

To think that there would be a skill in the world that would render a rank seven Martial Exalted level cultivator utterly helpless against a rank five Martial Exalted level cultivator. This was completely unheard of!

“Die!!!”

Chu Feng suppressed the pain he was feeling throughout his body and raised the Immemorial Hero’s Sword in his grasp. He pointed the sword toward Shengguang Xuanye.

Boom!

A bolt of lightning descended from the sky and raced toward Shengguang Xuanye. Shengguang Xuanye was utterly horrified. He knew that he couldn’t fend against it.

Yet, instead of attempting to flee, he bellowed loudly, “Milord, save me!”

Boom!

The lightning bolt exploded.

But when the remnants of the lightning finally dissipated, Shengguang Xuanye appeared completely unharmed. Taking a closer look, another figure had appeared in front of Shengguang Xuanye.

It was an elder with black hair and a fair complexion. His eyes were incredibly sharp, and he emanated an air of malevolence.

However, what was most striking of all was the Holy Valley robe he was wearing!
