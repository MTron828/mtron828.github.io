Chapter 2630 - Incomplete Immortal Armament

“Good eyesight. That is the best material that I have on me,” Chu Feng said.

“Its aura is very special. What is its origin?” Li Yue’er asked.

“It is a stone dyed with the Divine Dragon’s blood. Merely, as it is not complete, it is difficult to turn it into an Ancestral Armament,” Chu Feng said.

“You only plan to turn such a good material into an Ancestral Armament?” Li Yue’er asked in astonishment.

“Are you suggesting that I turn it into an Incomplete Immortal Armament? While this Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler is qualified, I do not have other materials to work with,” Chu Feng said with a wry smile.

After deciphering the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart, Chu Feng had obtained a whole new level of understanding toward weaponry refinement techniques.

Thus, he felt that he was capable of refining an Ancestral Armament using the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler. However, if he were to refine an Incomplete Immortal Armament, it would be absolutely impossible.

It wasn’t that he doubted his own weaponry refinement techniques, nor was it because he didn’t dare to attempt it. Rather, Chu Feng felt that apart from the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler, the rest of his weaponry refinement materials were simply unable to allow him to refine an Incomplete Immortal Armament.

“Woosh~~~”

Right at that moment, Li Yue’er suddenly waved her sleeve. She pushed all of Chu Feng’s weaponry refinement materials into a corner and left behind only the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

Chu Feng revealed a confused expression upon seeing this.

However, before Chu Feng could question Li Yue’er’s action, Li Yue’er took out a Cosmos Sack and tossed it into the air. The next moment, countless treasures flew out from the Cosmos Sack and landed on either side of the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

Those were all weaponry refinement treasures. Furthermore, they were all very precious materials. In fact... some of those weaponry refinement materials were comparable to the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

“Wow! This girl is truly rich!”

“Chu Feng, you must capture this girl and hug onto her thighs.”

At that moment, even her Lady Queen was unable to contain herself from exclaiming in admiration. In fact, even her eyes started to shine with light.

If Chu Feng did not possess any materials apart from the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler that could help him refine an Incomplete Immortal Armament, then now, he possessed enough materials to refine three Incomplete Immortal Armaments.

“Choose whatever material you want from these. Use the best among them,” Li Yue’er said.

“Very well, consider it that I’m borrowing them from you. I will definitely repay you in the future.”

Chu Feng did not refuse the materials. After all, he really did need them.

However, those materials were truly precious. Chu Feng could not accept them just like that.

“There’s no need. That All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart of yours is over a thousand times more precious than these materials here. I am the one who owes you here,” Li Yue’er said.

“That’s something completely different. I said that I’m borrowing them, so I’m borrowing them,” Chu Feng said.

“It will be very difficult for you to refine an Incomplete Immortal Armament by yourself. Even if you are able to accomplish it, there would not be sufficient time. Let me help you. Although I can only provide assistance, it remains that I have also grasped the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart. Thus, if we are able to succeed in refining an Incomplete Immortal Armament, I would be able to benefit greatly too.”

“Thus, even though I am providing these materials, it is also for my sake. You do not have to think too hard about it,” Li Yue’er said.

“I said that I am just borrowing them,” Chu Feng said determinedly.

Seeing how determined Chu Feng was, Li Yue’er started to frown. Then, she said in an annoyed manner, “Do as you wish.”

“Heh... that’s more like it,” Seeing that Li Yue’er had come to terms with him, Chu Feng smiled.

Then, he said, “My little assistant, there’s no time to delay, let us begin right away.”

Then, Chu Feng and Li Yue’er began to set up the Weaponry Refinement Grand Formation according to the methods laid out in the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.

Chu Feng was in charge of setting up the spirit formation, whereas Li Yue’er assisted him.

That said, even though the two of them were joining hands, even though there were sufficient materials, even though they were able to choose the best materials to refine an Incomplete Immortal Armament, it was still extremely difficult to successfully refine an Incomplete Immortal Armament.

Chu Feng felt that they only had a fifty percent chance of success.

After all, that was an Incomplete Immortal Armament they were dealing with. Apart from Li Yue’er, only the Infant Soul Sect’s Sectmaster possessed an Incomplete Immortal Armament in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still had to attempt it. After all, depending on the difference in the weaponry refinement’s difficulty, Chu Feng would also be able to obtain different levels of martial comprehension.

......

Then, Chu Feng and Li Yue’er began to jointly refine the Incomplete Immortal Armament.

Although there were many materials that could compare to the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler, Chu Feng still insisted on having the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler be the main material in the refinement process.

This... was actually Li Yue’er’s proposal.

Li Yue’er said that if the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler was really dyed with the Divine Dragon’s Blood, it would surpass the value of all the materials that she currently possessed.

If they were able to successfully forge an Incomplete Immortal Armament, then the Divine Dragon’s blood in the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler might awaken.

If that were to happen, they might be able to refine a top quality Incomplete Immortal Armament.

After Chu Feng and Li Yue’er began, they spent three entire months in the refinement process.

After three months passed, the appearance of the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler did not change much. Apart from the addition of a sword hilt that it could be held with, its body was still a four-sided lump of metal.

However, the carefully-selected materials used in the refinement process were all gone. They were fused into the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

Although the appearance of the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler did not change, Chu Feng and Li Yue’er had actually succeeded in assimilating those materials into the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

Thus, the current Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler was no longer the same as before. It possessed actual Immortal-level martial power.

It was only a step away from becoming an actual Incomplete Immortal Armament.

Right at that moment, Chu Feng shouted, “Girl, hang on! We are about to succeed!”

At that moment, they had reached the most crucial moment for the weaponry refinement process. However, both Chu Feng and Li Yue’er had exhausted an enormous amount of energy over the past three months.

The current Li Yue’er was already pale and covered in sweat.

Chu Feng, on the other hand, seemed to be doing better than her. He, at the very least, was still steady and stable. However, Li Yue’er’s hands were already trembling slightly.

This was the greatest fear during weaponry refinement. The reason for that was because Li Yue’er was also contributing to the continued activation of the spirit formation. As for weaponry refinement, the hands that one used to activate the spirit formation were the most crucial aspect. Even if one were to waver one’s hands in the slightest, it might affect the result of the weapon.

“Snap~~~”

Sure enough, as Li Yue’er’s hands trembled, a crack suddenly appeared on the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

“Snap~~~”

“Snap~~~”

“Snap~~~”

......

Following that, more and more cracks began to appear. Soon, cracks covered the entire body of the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler.

“Girl, steady yourself,” Seeing this scene, Chu Feng started to panic.

If the Divine Dragon’s Blood Ruler were to shatter at such a time, their efforts would truly have been wasted.

In fact, the two of them even might receive a backlash from the failure.

“Chu Feng, my apologies, I will soon be unable to continue,” Li Yue’er said with great difficulty. Even her voice was trembling when she said those words. Her health was truly weak.

Hearing what Li Yue’er said, Chu Feng’s heart immediately sunk.

After interacting with Li Yue’er, he knew that she was not someone that would easily give up.

Since she was saying something like that, it meant that she was truly unable to hold on any longer.

Right at that moment, surging spirit power suddenly emerged from Chu Feng’s body. That spirit power covered the entire weaponry refinement formation.

Then, Chu Feng tightly clasped his palms and shouted, “Slow!”

Then, the spirit formation actually stopped its operation.

To be exact, it didn’t stop. Instead, the speed had decreased. Chu Feng had forcibly decreased the speed of the weaponry refinement formation’s operation.

“Girl, help me out. Move the assistant’s formation core onto my body,” Chu Feng said.

“No, Chu Feng... it will pose a danger to your life if I am to do that,” Hearing that, Li Yue’er immediately revealed an expression of panic.

“Chu Feng, you can’t make such a rash decision. Are you planning to throw away your life for cultivation?” Compared to Li Yue’er, Eggy was even more panicked

The two of them both knew very well that both Chu Feng’s stamina and spirit power had been greatly consumed. They were on the verge of being completely exhausted.

In such a situation, it was already extremely difficult for him to persist as the main operator of the formation.

If he were to take on the responsibility of the assistant operator too, the burden upon his body would be so great that Chu Feng would not be able to persist. Because of that, his body would be wrung dry by the spirit formation, and he would die from over-exhaustion.
