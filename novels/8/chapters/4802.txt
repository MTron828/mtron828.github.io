Chapter 4802: The Matchmaking Begins

“Grandfather, my older brother didn’t come out. I suspect that he’s already dead. But how could someone of his strength possibly die so easily? I’m certain that it was Chu Feng who killed him! Grandfather, you must avenge my older brother!”

Zuoqiu Youyu wasn’t angry at being slapped. Instead, he began complaining in an indignant tone. It could be seen that the Zuoqiu Brothers were a tightly bonded pair, and they respected their grandfather a lot.

“Zuoqiu Youyu, how shameless can you get? The two of you committed so many evil deeds, and yet you dare try to turn the tables on us?

“Vice sectmaster, I know that you’re Zuoqiu Youyu and Zuoqiu Yanliang’s grandfather, but more than that, you’re the vice sectmaster of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect! You should be redressing our grievances too!”

Unwilling to let things rest so easily, Xia Yan began revealing the truth of what they had encountered in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm.

Of course, she told the truth about Zuoqiu Yanliang and Zuoqiu Youyu’s crimes, but she withheld information about what happened to Zuoqiu Yanliang. There was no way she would reveal that Chu Feng was the culprit who killed Zuoqiu Yanliang.

Li Muzhi, Zhao Shi, Song Xi, and the others also quickly spoke up in agreement.

The testimonies of Zhao Shi and the others were useless against someone of Zuoqiu Yanliang’s standing, but the same couldn’t be said about Xia Yan and Li Muzhi. With the two of them insisting that it was Zuoqiu Yanliang who tried to harm them, everyone slowly began to be convinced by their words.

“Vice sectmaster, you can check our injuries if you reserve any doubts. Even though we have already been treated, there’s still the aura of your grandson’s Shatter Sword on us,” Xia Yan pointed to her own wounds and said.

“Yes, that’s indeed the aura of Yanliang’s Exalted Armament. There’s no mistake about this.”

The vice sectmaster could already tell as much without having to step forward to take a look. It seemed like he had already discovered right from the start that the wounds on Xia Yan and the others were inflicted by his grandson.

“Youyu, what happened? Is what Xia Yan and the others said true? Did the two of you try to harm them without any valid reasons?” the vice sectmaster questioned furiously.

“Grandfather, I didn’t. I really didn’t! I also don’t know what conflict they had with my older brother.”

Seeing that it was impossible to argue for Zuoqiu Yanliang, Zuoqiu Youyu could only try to acquit himself.

“Zuoqiu Youyu, are you still a man? You don’t dare to admit to what you have done? You were the one who captured and tied us up in the trial! If what you said is true, why in the world are you blaming us when a mishap occurred to your older brother? Isn’t that clear evidence that you knew from the start that we were with Zuoqiu Yanliang?” Xia Yan bellowed.

“Xia Yan, where’s your evidence? If you want to accuse me of something, shouldn’t you bring out some evidence?” Zuoqiu Youyu asked.

It just so happened that Xia Yan didn’t have any evidence. They did have the rope which Zuoqiu Youyu had used to tie them up, but the problem was that no one knew that it belonged to Zuoqiu Youyu. It wasn’t like Zuoqiu Yanliang’s Shattered Sword, which one could recognize him by.

Not to mention, Zuoqiu Youyu had wisely chosen not to leave any trace of his aura on the rope. So, even if they brought it out right now, they couldn’t incriminate him.

“It turns out that you aren’t a man after all. A coward like you should just go and castrate yourself!”

Xia Yan couldn’t bring out any evidence, but she still continued to hurl insults at him. In truth, she knew that even if Zuoqiu Youyu had done something grievously wrong, it would be extremely difficult to sentence him to death.

In fact, had Chu Feng not killed Zuoqiu Yanliang, it was unlikely that he would be sentenced to death even if he was deemed guilty of his crimes. So, all she could do was to insult Zuoqiu Youyu a little and vent her anger.

“Xia Yan, stop talking.”

A person suddenly appeared. It was Xia Yan’s grandfather.

A moment later, Li Muzhi’s grandfather appeared too.

The situation finally started to calm down a little with their appearances. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Xia Yan’s injuries were enough to indict Zuoqiu Yanliang, but the latter hadn’t come out of the Yinyang Withered Well Realm yet. Based on past experience, it was unlikely that he was still alive. There was nothing they could do even if they wanted to pursue the matter.

As for the grudge between Zuoqiu Youyu and Xia Yan, there was no concrete evidence to form a solid case.

Of course, no one was able to do anything about Chu Feng either.

“Did you obtain anything during your trip to the Yinyang Withered Well Realm this time around?”

Hoping to alleviate the enmity in the air, Li Muzhi’s grandfather turned to Xia Yan and Chu Feng and asked.

“Yes. Chu Feng has reached Martial Exalted level and broke Lord Dugu Lingtian’s records again. It’s Chu Feng’s name that’s reflected on the Yinyang Withered Well Realm now,” Xia Yan said.

There was a proud and gleeful look on her face.

However, when Zuoqiu Youyu heard those words, the murderous intent he emanated grew even stronger. Even he had received nothing at all, but Chu Feng actually benefited from this trial.

This made him even more certain that the culprit who killed Zuoqiu Yanliang was him.

Chu Feng also frowned upon hearing Xia Yan’s words. He already knew that the sectmaster didn’t like him because he kept breaking Lord Dugu Lingtian’s records, but he ended up doing it again.

From the looks of it, it would seem that the sectmaster’s enmity toward him would only deepen. However, he didn’t blame Xia Yan for this.

All of the disciples present saw the name on the exit gate clearly, so someone else would have said it even if Xia Yan didn’t. There was no way to conceal this matter.

“As expected of you, Chu Feng. You’re growing really quickly.”

Li Muzhi’s grandfather and the others were happy for Chu Feng upon hearing that he had reached Martial Exalted level.

“Speaking of which, Chu Feng, I remember that you have signed up for Zi Ling’s matchmaking convention, right?” Li Muzhi’s grandfather asked.

“Yes, Lord Hidden Dragon Elder. I’ve indeed signed up for that,” Chu Feng replied.

“It has already been decided that it’ll be held tomorrow. Do you wish to proceed with it?” Li Muzhi’s grandfather asked.

“Lord Hidden Dragon Elder, what do you mean by that?’ Chu Feng asked.

He couldn’t help but become a bit agitated upon hearing this since it would determine whether he would be able to reach Zi Ling or not.

“The sectmaster has put out four conditions back then. Two of them are ‘within a month’ and ‘junior’s age’, and the remaining two have just been revealed.”

“What are they?” Chu Feng asked.

“The third condition is that the participant has to be a man.”
