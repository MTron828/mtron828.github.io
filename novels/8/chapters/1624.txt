MGA: Chapter 1625 - Must Apologize

“Nangong Ya, you are truly daring. My big brother is speaking with you, are you deaf or what?” Nangong Tianhu asked with a cold voice.

“Lil’ brother Ya is one of us. Speak to him more courteously,” Nangong Tianlong sighed, then laughed lightly.

“Big brother Tianlong, Chu Feng is my friend. Furthermore, he really did save Baihe’s, Moli’s and my life. Big brother Tianlong, I hope you will not make things difficult for Chu Feng,” Seeing that they could not leave, Nangong Ya hurriedly turned around and began to plead for Chu Feng.

“Lil’ brother Ya, what sort of words are those? Chu Feng is a guest, how could I possibly make things difficult for him? I merely have something that I wish to ask him about,” Nangong Tianlong said as he looked at Chu Feng.

“Chu Feng, you should know how important one’s appearance is to a woman. However, you still humiliated my fourth sister and insulted her appearance. What was the intention behind your action?”

“I was not insulting or humiliating her. Rather, I merely spoke the truth,” Chu Feng replied.

“Spoke the truth? Based on what are you qualified to determine that my fourth sister has altered her appearance?” Nangong Tianlong asked.

“Based on the fact that I am a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,” Chu Feng said.

“Someone like you is a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?” Nangong Tianfeng sneered. She clearly did not believe him.

“Buzz~~~”

Chu Feng did not bother with superfluous words. With a thought, boundless world spirit power spread forth from him. The golden world spirit power began to hover around Chu Feng. It was incomparably gorgeous. Furthermore, snake-like veined patterns were moving about through them.

“Hiss~~~”

Seeing this scene, many of the people present sucked in a mouthful of cold air. They had heard that Chu Feng was a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. However, as it was only something that they heard, they did not believe it to be true. Today, after having seen Chu Feng for themselves, they still hadn’t believed that he was a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.

However, at this moment, Chu Feng had shown them with his actions that they had guessed wrong. Chu Feng being very powerful was definitely not a rumor. Rather, it was a fact.

At the very least, Chu Feng being a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist was a fact. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Yoh, you have some skills. However, what makes you think that a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist like you is able to determine whether or not the Fourth Princess has altered her appearance?” Right at this moment, a young man suddenly stood up from his seat and walked over.

This man was very young. He possessed a rank two Half Martial Emperor cultivation and possessed quite a decent appearance. It was the sort of appearance that women were fond of. However, there was a trace of sinister intent between his eyebrows.

Most importantly, that young man was wearing a royal world spiritist cloak. Furthermore, there were also snake-like veined patterns on that royal world spiritist cloak. Evidently, his world spirit techniques were much more eye-catching than his cultivation. He was a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.

“Who are you? What makes you qualified to question Chu Feng? Chu Feng is someone who was recognized by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal on the Immortal Island. What makes you think you’re qualified to question him?” Nangong Baihe asked. She was able to tell with a single glance that this man was not from their Nangong Imperial Clan.

“Nangong Baihe, you are quite incorrect. This man is indeed qualified to question Chu Feng. What? You said Chu Feng is extraordinary because he has been recognized by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal? No matter how extraordinary he is, will he be as extraordinary as the personal disciple of the White-browed Immortal, who is equally as famous as the Weaponry Refinement Immortal?” asked the Fourth Princess Nangong Tianfeng.

“The White-browed Immortal’s personal disciple?” Hearing those words, Nangong Baihe started to frown, and her gaze began to flicker.

There were a total of Ten Immortals in the Holy Land of Martialism. These Ten Immortals were all Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists. Furthermore, they were also the only Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the Holy Land of Martialism right now.

The White-browed Immortal was one of them. Thus, he was indeed as equally famous as the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.

If this young man before them was truly the White-browed Immortal’s personal disciple, then he would not be someone to look down on.

Personal disciple, as the name implies, were disciples who grew up beside the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, people who were personally taught by the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists. Naturally, their world spirit techniques would be extremely powerful.

“I am Meng Xiaoyan, my master is the White-browed Immortal,” Right at this moment, that Meng Xiaoyan clasp his hand, introduced himself and greeted Nangong Baihe with a hypocritical smile on his face.

Hearing those words, not to mention Nangong Baihe, even Nangong Ya started to frown. Their opponent was the White-browed Immortal’s personal disciple. Evidently, this person had not come with good intentions. At this moment, Nangong Ya seemed to realize why Nangong Tianlong would want to invite Chu Feng over. It was clear that they had planned this beforehand.

However, Chu Feng was as calm as always. He asked, “What you are implying earlier is that Nangong Tianfeng’s appearance has not been altered?”

“Her Highness the Fourth Princess is a natural beauty. Naturally, she would not have altered her appearance,” Meng Xiaoyan ascertained.

“That Nangong Tianfeng’s appearance has clearly been altered. Yet, you insist on saying that it hasn’t. Is it truly proper for you to flatter her like this? Will this not be a disgrace toward your master’s reputation?” Chu Feng asked.

“Hahaha...” Meng Xiaoyan laughed coldly. Then, he said, “What makes you think you’re qualified to question me? Could it be that you want to compete with me in terms of world spirit techniques?”

“Brother, give me, Nangong Ya, some face and not make things difficult for Chu Feng, okay?”

Right at this moment, Nangong Ya suddenly spoke. As he spoke, he actually bent his knee and, with a ‘putt,’ kneeled onto the ground. He said, “All the wrongs were caused by me. Whatever it is that you all wish to do, aim them all at me, Nangong Ya.”

“Brother Nangong, what are you doing? Stand up and act like a man. Don’t make me, Chu Feng, look down on you,” Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately walked to Nangong Ya and lent him an arm to help him up.

However, Nangong Ya refused to stand back up. Instead, with a smile on his face, he said to Chu Feng, “Brother Chu Feng, it is all my fault. I should have listened to lil’ sister Baihe. I shouldn’t have brought you here. It was me who was too confident in myself. I should be the one to bear all of this.”

“Lil brother Ya, what are you doing? None of us said we’re going to make things difficult for Chu Feng,” Nangong Tianlong laughed lightly.

“While we did not plan to make things difficult for Chu Feng, this Chu Feng instead did not recognize our good intentions, and immediately insulted our fourth sister right after coming here.”

“However, since lil’ brother Ya is pleading for him like this, we’ll give him a chance. We will not make things difficult for him.”

“However, since he dared to insult our fourth sister, we cannot allow him to just leave. While leaving is fine, he must apologize first,” Third Prince Nangong Tianshi said.

“How do you want him to apologize?” Nangong Ya asked.

“Apologize while kowtowing,” Third Prince Nangong Tianshi said.

“You...” Hearing those words, Nangong Ya was so enraged that his expression changed enormously.

“Sigh, there’s no need to kowtow. After all, not only did Chu Feng save lil’ brother Ya’s life, he was also invited here by Aunt Lian. Even if we do not give lil’ brother Ya face today, we must give Aunt Lian face.”

“Chu Feng, it would do if you were to serve each of us a cup of tea. Then, you can leave,” As Nangong Tianlong spoke, he took a glance at Meng Xiaoyan.

Meng Xiaoyan smiled sinisterly. Then, with a light wave of his sleeve, the teapot and cups all floated into the air. Then, with a shake of his palm, ‘bang,’ all of the teapot and cups were shattered. The tea water splattered everywhere.

However, those tea water were merely floating in midair and had not landed on the ground.
