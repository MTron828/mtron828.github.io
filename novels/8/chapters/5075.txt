Chapter 5075: Agitation

“That is…”

Chu Feng’s eyes soon fell upon a miserable figure who was tied up and hanging from mid-air. That person was in a near-death state.

Astonishingly, it was none other than Lord Yunliang, who had helped Chu Feng take Yaoyao away from here back then.

Chu Feng thought that Lord Yunliang would have definitely lost his life for what he did, so it was a relief to see that he was still alive. However, Lord Yunliang was being put through cruel torture even though there was a breath left in him.

“MIlord, can you release Lord Yunliang?” Chu Feng turned to the Asura King and asked.

He knew that it was under the Asura King’s command that Lord Yunliang was being punished. If he wished to save Lord Yunliang, he would have to first acquire the Asura King’s agreement.

“He colluded with you back then to steal my Brightmoon. I’m only sparing you on the account of my Brightmoon, but Yunliang betrayed our clan despite being a member of our Asura World Spirit Army. What he has done is unforgivable.”

The Asura King gritted his teeth in hatred when he spoke about the incident, making it clear that he had no intention of sparing Lord Yunliang.

“Listen to my daddy and release that old man!” Yaoyao suddenly interjected.

“Brightmoon?”

The Asura King looked at Yaoyao indignantly.

“What? You don’t understand my words? Also, didn’t I tell you to call me Yaoyao? I’m not Brightmoon!” Yaoyao shouted.

Yaoyao wasn’t showing the slightest respect toward the Asura King at all even though she usually acted so obediently in front of Chu Feng. Yet, the Asura King was unable to do anything about it at all. As reluctant as he was, he still waved his sleeves and released Lord Yunliang.

Chu Feng quickly flew over and caught Lord Yunliang in his arms before proceeding to treat him. He quickly noticed that Lord Yunliang’s cultivation had been crippled, making him no different from a mortal now.

It made him feel deeply apologetic, especially when he remembered how powerful Lord Yunliang used to be.

Under Chu Feng’s treatment, Lord Yunliang quickly regained his consciousness.

“Chu… Feng? Why are you here? Am I dreaming?”

Lord Yunliang had been tortured for too long that his consciousness was all muddled him. He dared not believe what he was seeing was real when he saw Chu Feng.

“Lord Yunliang, this isn’t a dream. I’ve returned with your princess. You can leave this place now,” Chu Feng said.

“What? You brought her back? Are you out of your mind?!”

Despite being in a severely weakened state, Lord Yunliang was so agitated by Chu Feng’s words that he immediately reached out and grabbed Chu Feng’s collars.

“Old man, let go of my daddy!” Yaoyao ran over and berated Lord Yunliang.

Lord Yunliang looked at Yaoyao, and tears began brimming in his eyes. His face reflected his deep regret and self-reproach.

“Chu Feng, why did you turn your back on me? You sullied my loyalty to the Asura World Spirit Army. You trampled all over my determination!” Lord Yunliang cried out of sheer sorrow.

“Lord Yunliang, what do you mean?”

Chu Feng immediately noticed that something was amiss. He had thought that it was weird that Lord Yunliang would agree to help the Wretched Black Demon back then, and this showed that there was indeed more to the story.

Lord Yunliang must have his own reasons for betraying the Asura World Spirit Army.

Wu!

Lord Yunliang’s body abruptly fell limply to the ground. Chu Feng didn’t see how it happened, but he subconsciously glanced at the Asura King.

“That man is a traitor of our clan. There’s no need to listen to his words,” the Asura King said.

He then turned around to face the millions of Asura Evil Spirits that had gathered in the area. Every single one of them wielded incredible strength, and the sheer pressure they collectively exerted was incomparable.

Even the puppet army would have looked no different from an assembly of children before the Asura World Spirit Army. There was simply no comparing them.

Those standing at the forefront of the Asura Evil Spirits were all familiar faces to Chu Feng as they were the ones who were involved in Yaoyao’s ritual back then. Their cultivation was still indiscernible to him despite the huge advancement in his cultivation.

However, he was certain that they were all at Half-God level at the very least, considering how their auras were far more intense than that of Jiang Taibai.

They looked at Yaoyao with fervent eyes filled with desire. Some of them also directed hateful and murderous gazes at Chu Feng.

Chu Feng had no doubt that these people would tear out his tendons and mince his flesh if not for Yaoyao protecting him.

“Lord Father, I heard that my younger sister has returned?”

A person suddenly stepped forth from the crowd. It was a young man dressed in grandiose robes. He appeared to be the son of the Asura King judging from how he addressed the latter, which made him the prince of the Asura World Spirit Army.

It was just surprising to Chu Feng that the Asura King would have such a young son despite his old age. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Brightsun, I know that you were in closed-door training, but your younger sister has come back. She will take us out of this place, but she’ll need your help for that,” the Asura King said.

“Lord Father, I know where my responsibilities lie,” Prince Brightsun replied with a nod.

He made his way over to Chu Feng and Yaoyao’s side and said, “Younger sister, welcome back.”

“Who’s your younger sister?” Yaoyao replied in irritation.

Then, she turned to the Asura King and impatiently asked, “Can we start now?”

“Brightmoon, I won’t be able to help you with this. Your older brother will be able to lend you a helping hand, but you’re still the crux to this. You’ll be the one who decides whether our Asura World Spirit Army will be able to see the light of the day or not,” the Asura King said.

“I know what I have to do, but you need to fulfill your promise too! Otherwise… Hmph!”

Yaoyao shook her little fists menacingly.

“I’ll fulfill the end of my promise,” the Asura King promised.

Yaoyao leaped onto the King’s Stand upon hearing the Asura King’s promise.

Prince Brightsun quickly did the same too and took his position behind Yaoyao. He intertwined his fingers and began releasing a huge outpour of spirit power. His spirit power twinkled with bits of light, which turned out to be runes upon close inspection. Clearly, Yaoyao wasn’t the only special one here.

His spirit power swiftly wrapped itself around Yaoyao, but Yaoyao ignored him. Instead, she took out a knife and slit her own arm. Then, she squatted down and placed her palm on the King’s Stand.

Blood flowed down her arm and onto the King’s Stand, inducing an immediate reaction.

Boom!

The entire Asura King Palace began to tremor.

As more of Yaoyao’s blood trickled down, runes started to cover the King’s Stand.

The Asura Evil Spirits were excited to witness this sight. After all, they were finally going to be freed from this prison.

Chu Feng could sense their anticipation too, but it still bothered him how Lord Yunliang was unwilling to allow the Asura Evil Spirits to leave this place. Was it because the Asura Evil Spirits would slaughter the innocents after escaping from the Asura Graveyard, or was there some other reason?

As much as Chu Feng needed the help of the Asura Evil Spirits, he was unable to turn his attention away from this question.

Shoosh!

A shocking sight suddenly occurred.

Prince Brightsun suddenly thrust his palm forward to shove Yaoyao, pushing her toward the black inferno with tremendous force. That would have indubitably spelled her death.

Chu Feng widened his eyes in shock. He tried to grab Yaoyao with his spirit power, but it was to no avail. He could only watch helplessly as Yaoyao fell toward the black inferno.

Without any hesitation, he dived into the black inferno to chase after Yaoyao.
