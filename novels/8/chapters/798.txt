MGA: Chapter 799 - Approval?

“Suffer double losses?” The already puzzled Old Liu and the others were even more puzzled when they heard those words. Their minds were rather foggy.

“Haha, Seniors, it’s like this...” Hearing that, Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, and Fu Fengming spoke at the same time.

Then, with their voices overlapping one another’s, Xuan Xiaochao and the others roughly narrated the scene they had witnessed before to Old Liu and the others.

“What? Something like this happened?” After knowing of such an event, their complexions changed once again, into one that was quite full of amazement.

They couldn’t help casting their gazes at Chu Feng, but as they did so, they did not only look at him with shock and bewilderment, but with admiration and respect as well.

“Haha, great, this is truly great! Wuqing, you’ve really helped my Crippling Night Demon Sect immensely!

“Hahaha, Murong Xun was that arrogant, huh? Let’s see how he can continue acting the same now!” As they felt shock, the Nine Gold-cloak Brothers suddenly started laughing. Their laughter was one of excitement, and one of relief.

The reason they gathered such a horde of troops and set up a trap here was to reduce the moral of the Immortal Execution Archipelago. However, unexpectedly, they faced one setback after another due to the appearance of a traitor and were almost entirely defeated by the Immortal Execution Archipelago.

The reason why they were able to obtain victory today could be said to be all due to Chu Feng. It was he who gave them help at the most crucial moment, letting them reverse the momentum of the battle completely.

Although they had still lost many brothers, looking back, it was still worth it.

Chu Feng’s very actions were things they didn’t even dare to imagine. The Immortal Execution Archipelago had truly suffered an enormous loss this time. Not only by the hands of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, but more so by the hands of Chu Feng.

A widely recognized beautiful fiancée, and a powerful Royal Armament spear—those were much more valuable than the lives of over a thousand Immortal Execution Archipelago experts. Even if they sacrificed more people they would still not be equal.

Yet, those two both landed within Chu Feng’s hands. Murong Xun’s losses were truly massive, and to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, the losses were massive as well.

“Brother Wuqing, what sort of technique do you have? Why were their attacks useless to you?”

At that moment, You Tonghan had suddenly leapt forward. With an expression of a million admirations, he was leaping towards Chu Feng’s position.

“Don’t come over!” Chu Feng said, in an attempt to stop him.

But it was already too late; You Tonghan was too fast. With a face of smiles, and a giant leap, he came down from above.

In the end, with a bang, as if he had crashed into a steel wall, You Tonghan’s face full of smiles distorted, and before he had even truly reached Chu Feng, he was rebounded back, and fiercely crashed onto the floor.

“Brother Wuqing, what is that thing behind you? It’s that powerful?” You Tonghan said with astonishment as he rubbed his own head.

“As I thought, the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation is protecting him. No, to be more precise, the Demon Sealing Sword is protecting him,” said the Earth King confidently after seeing that.

“The Demon Sealing Sword? You’re talking about the Royal Armament Lord Sect Head left behind?” the crowd asked gravely. All of their expressions couldn’t help changing as they heard those words.

“That’s right. It’s certain the Demon Sealing Sword is the one that’s protecting him. Otherwise, it’d be impossible for the Eighth Immortal, such a powerful person, to be unable to injure him. Right now, he is protected by the Demon Sealing Sword.

“Moreover, if I’m not mistaken, the Demon Sealing Sword also helped Wuqing obtain the Royal Armament in his hand, since I had clearly seen a ray of light shoot out of the Demon Sealing Sword which severed the connection between Murong Xun and the Royal Armament,” the Earth King said.

“Heavens, I think I also saw that!”

Xuan Xiaochao and the others all came to a realization when they heard that. Back then, when Murong Xun summoned the Royal Armament, the Royal Armament was still struggling. Yet, when a ray of light shot out of the Demon Sealing Sword, the Royal Armament calmed down. Murong Xun was also enraged when that happened.

Recalling all that, they confirmed that it was the Demon Sealing Sword which protected Chu Feng, and it was also the Demon Sealing Sword which helped Chu Feng seize the Royal Armament from Murong Xun’s hands. Complicated expressions were on nearly everyone’s faces, and as they looked at Chu Feng, their eyes were full of indescribable emotions. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Chu Feng nodded his head in agreement as he faced those complex gazes, and said, “Senior Earth King could not be more correct. With my own abilities, I am naturally unable to seize this Royal Armament. It was indeed the Demon Sealing Sword that helped me.” As Chu Feng spoke, he looked back at the sword.

At that moment, as he held a Royal Armament in his hand, he was able to feel how powerful it was. If it truly recognized Chu Feng as its master, then it would most definitely raise his fighting strength significantly. However, being so close, he could also feel quite clearly the difference between the Royal Armament in his hand and the Demon Sealing Sword behind him.

No matter how much more power the silver-coloured spear in Chu Feng’s hand possessed, it was still an armament. However, the Demon Sealing Sword behind him seemed more as if it were truly alive. With the airs of a ruler, it menaced everyone. Arrogance, dominance, invincibility.

He finally knew why the Demon Sealing Sword was titled as the number one Royal Armament in the Eastern Sea Region, despite it too being a Royal Armament.

It was because the difference between the two was indeed enormous. They were incomparable, not even on the same level.

“This Demon Sealing Sword is the most powerful Royal Armament in the Eastern Sea Region. Even the sect head back in the day exerted a lot of power and used special techniques to subdue it. In reality, however, he was still unable to truly force it into submission.

“Ever since the sect head died, the Royal Armament has always been placed here. Before dying, he used its power to lay this Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation here, and warned the Four Protectors that, before reaching the degree of strength of his, they should absolutely not forcibly take away this sword, otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable.

“Actually, back then, Lord Qiu Canfeng had once tried to move this Demon Sealing Sword, but he was simply unable to even approach it,” said Old Liu while he was in shock.

“Yeah! The reason why the Demon Sealing Sword is put here without any guards is because the Demon Sealing Sword itself is its strongest guard. Unless one has absolute power, or recognized as its master, they should not even think of approaching it, let alone taking it away.” The Earth King also nodded.

“Doesn’t this mean that Brother Wuqing has received the approval of the Demon Sealing Sword?!” Everyone’s gazes as they looked at Chu Feng became filled with even more complicated emotions.

“Brother Wuqing, since you’re able to approach the Demon Sealing Sword, why not try and see if you can pull it out of the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation?” the Earth King said calmly, but in his eyes were odd expressions.

“Mm.” Chu Feng nodded, then turned around. Under the close gazes of the crowd, he walked slowly towards the exceptionally powerful Demon Sealing Sword.
