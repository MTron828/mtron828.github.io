Chapter 5443: Continuing the Challenge

“When did you notice me?” The woman looked at Chu Feng in disbelief.

“I noticed you from the moment you arrived,” Chu Feng replied.

He was the first one to arrive in this ancient city, but he quickly realized that someone else was here too. He couldn’t ascertain how strong the other person was, so he intentionally spoke aloud and made it seem like he was trying to uncover the fortuitous encounter when the truth was that he was constructing a formation to deal with the other party.

This formation combined offensive and defensive properties. He could use its power to suppress or even kill the enemy, but at the same time, he could also use it to teleport randomly into the far distance.

He had prepared different means so that he could make his escape if the situation turned out to be disadvantageous to him.

The woman examined the formation and confirmed that Chu Feng wasn’t just bragging. She realized that she had utterly lost today.

“What’s your background?” the woman asked.

Chu Feng didn’t answer the question. Instead, he glanced at the woman’s sword and smiled. “Your sword is not too bad.”

He exerted a suction force to take the sword away, but to his surprise, he could not pry it out of the woman’s grasp. There appeared to be a formation inside that prevented him from pulling it out of the woman’s hand.

“Interesting.”

This was the first time Chu Feng had encountered such a treasure, but that only made him want it even more. Thus, he channeled his formation in an attempt to snatch the sword away from the woman’s hand, but the sword wasn’t budging at all.

“It’s useless. This sword is beyond your means to control,” the woman replied with absolute confidence.

Even when suppressed, she remained absolutely confident that Chu Feng couldn’t take her sword away. However, her confidence soon gave way to fluster as the sword in her hand began to quiver.

The sword was not succumbing to Chu Feng’s suction force. Rather, it was wavering.

“Chu Feng. I remember your name.”

The woman gave Chu Feng one last look before a red spirit power enveloped her. She vanished right after. It was teleportation energy!

Chu Feng couldn’t tell if the woman had invoked a teleportation formation she had constructed beforehand or that she had another protective formation on her, but regardless, the teleportation energy was incredibly powerful, to the point where even the powerful formation he had spent three days constructing was unable to stop it.

“That woman’s sword really is something else. She doesn’t seem to be from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,” Eggy said.

“I guess not all talented world spiritists are from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, after all. The world of cultivation sure has a lot of hidden masters. Regardless of where she is from, that sword is truly formidable. Just by grasping onto the sword, she’s able to receive a huge boost to her spirit power that allows her to overwhelm me with just simple attacks. If only I had obtained that sword, I’d be able to raise my spirit power fighting prowess to a new height,” Chu Feng said in lamentation.

He had truly wanted to take possession of that sword.

“What a pity she got away,” Eggy said regretfully.

“There might still be a chance in the future,” Chu Feng said.

“Do you think that she’ll return?”

It was clear that the woman was from a formidable background, judging by how she was able to escape from Chu Feng’s formation. Eggy was worried that she would make a comeback and get back on Chu Feng.

“She probably won’t be returning in the short term. She teleported quite far away, probably to another realm,” Chu Feng said.

“You must have scared her.” Eggy laughed.

The woman had come confidently, only to escape in a fluster. While her means were formidable, there was no doubt that Chu Feng was the stronger one here.

“I can focus my effort on deciphering the fortuitous encounter here now.”

Chu Feng began channeling his formation once again, and a gush of energy flowed toward the ancient city. Within moments, runes began to surface from the ancient city.

“Your formation has this function too?” Eggy remarked.

She hadn’t expected Chu Feng’s formation to be so formidable that it could be used to uncover the fortuitous encounter on top of dealing with that woman.

“There’s more to that. My formation is also able to interfere with the fortuitous encounter here too,” Chu Feng replied.

Even before the woman made an appearance, he had already known that she was formidable. He wasn’t sure whether this formation was enough to suppress the woman, so he embedded a random teleportation function into the formation in case he needed to make an escape.

The problem was that if Chu Feng was forced to make an escape, it was likely that the woman would notice the fortuitous encounter too and attempt to claim it. Thus, he also constructed a formation that would immediately disrupt the fortuitous encounter if he teleported away. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Even if he couldn’t obtain the fortuitous encounter here, he wouldn’t let the woman claim it that easily!

As a matter of fact, that woman had chosen not to appear right away because she noticed that Chu Feng was a capable world spiritist, so she wanted to reap the fruits of his effort. Little did she know that she was playing right into his hand.

As Chu Feng continued channeling the formation, more runes surfaced in the ancient city. These runes were randomly scattered but Chu Feng knew that they could be strung together to form a complete message. To use an analogy, these runes were like puzzle pieces that needed to be put together to form a complete picture.

It wouldn’t be easy to do so, but such tricks couldn’t hope to impede Chu Feng.

As Chu Feng tried to string the runes together, he realized that the fortuitous encounter was more complicated than he had expected.

“Eggy, it’s actually a multiple-choice question. What should I choose?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.

“What do you mean?” Eggy asked. While she shared vision and hearing with Chu Feng, she was unable to decipher the clues he had obtained thus far.

“The fortuitous encounter is a scroll that likely contains a formation. I can choose to take the scroll and leave right away, but alternatively, I can also forgo this reward and challenge a more advanced formation. If I clear the challenge, I’ll be allowed to enter another realm and decipher another fortuitous encounter for a better reward,” Chu Feng replied.

“Will the reward be much better?” Eggy asked.

“They are on two completely different levels,” Chu Feng said.

“Then you’re asking a redundant question,” Eggy replied with a smile. She already knew what Chu Feng was going to choose.

“Hehe. Opportunity and risk come hand in hand. While this formation is formidable too, there’s no point hogging onto it when there’s something better,” Chu Feng said.

“What are you hesitating for then? Go on and make your choice,” Eggy said.

“All right, I’ll listen to you,” Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.

He formed a series of hand seals that caused the runes to revolve around the ancient city. The realm began to unravel so that it could be recreated.

Astonishingly, this unraveling process could be seen in the painting of the Gate of the Masses.
