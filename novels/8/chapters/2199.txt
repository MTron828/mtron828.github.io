Chapter 2199 - Accidental Discovery

“Senior!!!” Upon seeing that, Chu Feng hurriedly set up a healing formation. He had Liu Chengkun lay onto the healing formation, and then began to infuse his spirit power into Liu Chengkun’s body to diagnose and heal him.

“Dang! That old man is truly too tired of living. You have merely refused him once more. Yet, he actually decided to mutilate himself?” Eggy said in a very surprised manner.

“No, he is not self-mutilating, nor is he injured. Rather, he is ill,” Chu Feng said.

“Ill?” Hearing those words, Eggy’s expression changed. She did not understand why Liu Chengkun would be ill all of a sudden.

“Yes, he is indeed ill. Furthermore, he is extremely ill. This should be a relapse of his illness,” After Chu Feng said those words, he grew silent, and started to set up another spirit formation to help Liu Chengkun treat his illness.

The spirit formation he set up this time around was very powerful. Chu Feng even added a lot of rare healing medicinal herbs into his spirit formation. He was planning to use that spirit formation to treat Liu Chengkun’s illness.

Unfortunately, that illness was truly too difficult to cure. It took an entire day and night of effort for Chu Feng to stabilize Liu Chengkun’s illness.

However... he had only managed to stabilize it. Chu Feng was shocked to discover that he was simply unable to cure Liu Chengkun’s illness. In fact, he was incapable of even helping Liu Chengkun regain consciousness.

“Little friend Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. Even our Society President needed at least two days and night to stabilize Elder Liu’s illness. Never would I have expected that you would be able to stabilize his illness in a single day,” Huang Luo stepped forward and said to Chu Feng.

“In that case, you all already know of Senior Liu’s illness?” Chu Feng asked.

“Little friend Chu Feng, I will not conceal this from you. What Elder Liu has is an incurable disease. Only Immortal-cloak World Spiritists would be able to treat his illness.”

“However, even for Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, they must still treat him on a daily schedule. Furthermore, they must continue to do so for an entire year in order to cure his illness.”

“For existences like Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, how could they possibly be willing to spend an entire year to treat the illnesses of people like us? That is why Elder Liu’s illness could be said to be an incurable disease.”

“In fact, Elder Liu’s illness has already entered the terminal stage. He will not be able to continue to live for much longer.”

“That is also the reason why his illness relapsed so quickly. His situation is truly becoming more and more unstable,” Huang Luo said in succession.

After knowing about that matter, Chu Feng’s heart sunk. Even though Chu Feng had not known Liu Chengkun for long, he greatly admired Liu Chengkun and felt indebted to him.

Upon thinking that a good man like him would not be able to live for long because of his illness, Chu Feng felt truly unreconciled.

“Chu Feng, it is actually not a coincidence that we appeared at the Tang Family. Rather, Elder Liu deliberately brought me there with him.”

“He had received the news, and deduced that you might go to save Tang Ying. That is why he wanted to help you.”

“Elder Liu truly thought very highly of you. He deeply hoped that you would be able to join our Red Butterfly Society. He even declared that it was the loss of our Red Butterfly Society for you to refuse to join us.”

“At the same time, he also declared that even if you were to refuse to join our Red Butterfly Society, he still did not wish for a talent like you to fall at the hands of Luyang’s Pavilion.”

“Speaking of it, I am ashamed. After Elder Liu made that decision, I even urged him not to bear dangers because of you.” Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

“The reason for that was because I am very certain that even Elder Liu would not have certainty in being able to defeat Hong Xi. Merely... he refused to listen to my advice.”

“Thus, Chu Feng, Elder Liu was truly prepared to sacrifice himself to help you before he even left for the Tang Family,” Huang Luo said.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt even more unwell.

“Chu Feng, I can tell that you are a passionate person. I also know that you will definitely feel uncomfortable after knowing about all this.”

“However, you actually do not have to feel too uncomfortable. The reason Elder Liu was willing to sacrifice himself for you is also because of the fact that he knew he would not be able to live for long.”

“Rather than being tormented to death by his illness, he was more willing to die with meaning. To him, dying to save you was something very meaningful,” Huang Luo said.

“Senior, you don’t have to say it like that. Since you said that his illness is curable by Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, it means that Senior Liu will not necessarily die,” Chu Feng said.

“While it is true that Immortal-cloak World Spiritists will be able to cure him, and we have also attempted to find him an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to heal him. But...!” Huang Luo did not finish his words, and started to sigh.

Chu Feng was actually trying to tell Huang Luo that he would one day become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. If Liu Chengkun was still alive then, he would be willing to treat Liu Chengkun’s illness.

Merely, Chu Feng did not wish to boast. After all, he was not yet an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. He also did not know how long it would take for him to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. That was the reason why he did not say those things.

“Rumble~~~”

Right at that moment, the underground palace suddenly started to shake. A large motion came from the surface above.

“Crap! Could it be that people from Luyang’s Pavilion have pursued us here?” Huang Luo’s expression immediately changed.

“Senior Huang, wait here first. I’ll go out and have a look,” As Chu Feng spoke, he flew out of the underground palace. After concealing his aura, he soared into the sky.

Merely, after he soared into the sky and looked to the mountain forest down below, Chu Feng was unable to find any trace of people from Luyang’s Pavilion. In fact, he did not even discover any destruction to the mountain below.

Unable to find anything, Chu Feng decided to cast his gaze toward the direction where the quake originated from.

“That is?”

After using his Heaven’s Eyes to observe his surroundings, Chu Feng was shocked to discover that a soft light had appeared at the location where the quake had originated from.

That light was very beautiful. However, he was only able to see it when using his Heaven’s Eyes.

“That light is strange. I did not see it before I coming here. It is definitely man-made.”

Chu Feng was unable to determine what that light was. However, he wanted to go and investigate it. Thus, he hid himself in the void, then began to carefully proceed toward the location that the light covered.

Finally, Chu Feng entered the location covered by the light. It was a lake in the mountain range.

That light invisible to the naked eye was covering the entire lake.

After entering the lake, the light grew more and more concentrated.

Inside the dense concentration of light, Chu Feng’s spirit power actually lost its effectiveness. Likewise, his Heaven’s Eyes also lost their effect.

“Could it be a treasure?”

At that moment, Chu Feng had a faint sensation that the light should be coming from some sort of treasure. Else, it would be impossible for it to isolate his spirit power and even his Heaven’s Eyes’ power of observation.

Although Chu Feng was unable to determine what sort of treasure it was, Chu Feng was certain that it was most definitely not caused by the people from Luyang’s Pavilion.

‘Who came here?’

‘Who used this sort of treasure?’

‘What is their intention? Could it be that there are treasures in the lake?’

With many questions in his mind, Chu Feng continued onward. However, the further he proceeded, the less Chu Feng could see.

In the end, Chu Feng was only able to see things within ten meters of him. For everything more than ten meters away, he could only see indistinct shadows.

In such a situation, Chu Feng did not dare to be careless. Although he had concealed his aura, he decided that he would take out his Magma Emperor Sword. After concealing the light emitted by the blazing Magma Emperor Sword, he proceeded onward even more carefully.

Chu Feng had a sensation that he was growing closer and closer to that treasure.

Finally, Chu Feng saw an indistinct silhouette. It was growing closer and closer, closer and closer. Finally, that silhouette came within ten meters of Chu Feng’s line of sight.

“Sssss!!!”

Upon seeing that figure, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, and sucked in a mouthful of cold air.

He saw a woman. She was very beautiful. Although her beauty could not compare to Eggy’s, she was definitely not someone that Tang Ying could compare with.

Her straight and lifted nose, her lush and soft lips, and that sexy oval face. It could be said that this woman’s facial features were extremely good.

Furthermore, in addition to her exquisite facial features, that woman also had an extremely good figure. She had curves all at the right places. It could be said that she possessed a demon-like figure.

Furthermore, that woman’s skin was extremely good. Not only was her skin fair like snow, her skin was also sparking and translucent like a pearl.

Most importantly, such a beauty was actually wearing nothing right now.

Just like that... completely naked, she appeared before Chu Feng’s line of sight.
