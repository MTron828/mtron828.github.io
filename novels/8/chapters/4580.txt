Chapter 4580: It All Depends On You

After receiving her reward, Long Xiaoxiao, together with her parents, left the camp of the Holy Light Clan too. As such, the only outsider left was Chu Feng.

Coincidentally, barely an hour after Long Xiaoxiao parted from Chu Feng, he succeeded in breaching the formation made out of Niantian Energy in his body. Ironically, he was still unable to tap into Niantian Energy for his cultivation.

“Could this be a trial that Daoist Niantian has left for me? Or is it a surprise?”

Chu Feng wondered doubtfully after breaching the formation.

A map had emerged inside Chu Feng’s body after the formation of Niantian Energy was breached. Other than the fact that it was formed of Niantian Energy, it was a perfectly normal map. In other words, if he wanted to find the place denoted by the map, he would have to do research himself.

Given so, Chu Feng couldn’t help but doubt Daoist Niantian’s intentions.

“Young friend Chu Feng, are you there?”

While Chu Feng was deep in thought, someone suddenly knocked on the door of Chu Feng’s room.

It was the people from the Holy Light Clan. Quite a group of them had come by this time around, and the one leading the group was a Supreme Elder of the Holy Light Clan, Shengguang Yunyue.

“Paying respects to Lord Yunyue.”

After opening his door, Chu Feng bowed slightly to greet Shengguang Yunyue.

He had met Shengguang Yunyue back at the banquet, and the latter’s attitude toward him was not too bad too. More importantly, she was a respected Supreme Elder of the Holy Light Clan who possessed far greater strength than him, so he dared not to show any disrespect.

“We’ve kept you waiting, young friend Chu Feng. Here is the reward we have prepared for you.”

Shengguang Yunyue got straight to the point and passed an urn over to Chu Feng.

This urn was similar to the one which she had given to Long Xiaoxiao, just that it was bigger in size.

Chu Feng opened the urn and saw that it was filled with golden fluid. It looked identical to the Holy Light Bloodline Essence Long Xiaoxiao had obtained, just that it was greater in volume too.

It did make sense since he was the champion of the tournament, after all.

“Thank you, Lord Yunyue.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Chu Feng quickly stowed away the Holy Light Bloodline Essence. It was the only reason why he had chosen to participate in the tournament and stay in the Holy Light Clan for so long.

However, Shengguang Yunyue suddenly reached out and stopped Chu Feng.

“Young friend Chu Feng, the Holy Light Bloodline Essence is concocted using a secret method of our Holy Light Clan. It won’t last for too long, so it’ll be best for you to assimilate it as soon as possible,” Shengguang Yunyue explained.

“How do I assimilate it?” Chu Feng asked.

“After consuming it, you can assimilate it just like any other natural oddities,” Shengguang Yunyue replied.

Hearing those words, Chu Feng unhesitatingly did as Shengguang Yunyue mentioned and consumed the Holy Light Bloodline Essence before proceeding on to cultivate right away.

Wuu!

However, as soon as Chu Feng tried to circulate his martial energy, his face suddenly scrunched up tightly.

Gah!

A cry of agony sounded from his lips as he collapsed to the ground in pain. At the same time, disgusting black spots began appearing all over his body at a visible pace, causing his pain to intensify.

“Lord Yunyue... what does this mean?” Chu Feng gritted his teeth to bear with the pain as he sought an answer from Shengguang Yunyue.

Yet, who could have thought that Shengguang Yunyue wasn’t surprised by Chu Feng’s response at all? Instead, she looked at him coldly as if he was already a dead man.

“You’re incredibly talented, such that there’s indeed no one in the Holy Light Galaxy who is a match for you. What a pity. Your path as a cultivator is going to stop right here,” Shengguang Yunyue said.

“W-what do you mean? Are you saying that what I just consumed isn’t the Holy Light Bloodline Essence but poison?” Chu Feng asked in horror.

“You can think of it as poison,” Shengguang Yunyue said.

“Why did you poison me? We have no grudge with one another, so why are you treating me in such a manner?” Chu Feng glared at Shengguang Yunyue in anger and incomprehension.

“I don’t deny that there’s no grudge between us, but the world of cultivators is one where the strong reigns supreme. Our Holy Light Clan’s Shengguang Yu is severely ill, resulting in the slow progression of his cultivation.

“However, there’s a secret formula that can heal his injuries. It’s just that the requirements of the secret formula are a little extreme. We need a highly talented junior to serve as a cauldron in order to forge the medicine out.”

“For this, our Holy Light Clan has searched far and wide, but we weren’t able to find anyone suitable. Yet, you appeared at such a timely moment. You demonstrated your talents clearly to us on the Storm Combat Dragon Ring. If we use you as a cauldron, not only will we be able to fully heal Shengguang Yu’s injuries, but he’ll become much stronger too.

“And what you have just consumed isn’t just any ordinary poison but one that will turn you into a cauldron.”

Shengguang Yunyue looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with scorn.

As the saying went, ‘the vicious heart of a capricious woman should never be trusted’. Shengguang Yunyue was indubitably the very embodiment of the saying.

“I fought on the Holy Light Galaxy’s behalf to drive away the juniors from other galaxies, protecting the Holy Light Galaxy’s honor. How can you treat me in such a manner? You aren’t worthy of being the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy. You deserve to be viewed in scorn and spat at!” Chu Feng bellowed indignantly.

However, his response only made Shengguang Yunyue laugh heartily.

“Fought on the Holy Light Galaxy’s behalf? You sure know how to make your words sound nice. Do you dare say that the reason why you chose to join the tournament in the first place isn’t to make a name for yourself in the world? Do you dare say that you stay here for the past few days in order to obtain our Holy Light Clan’s cultivation treasure, the Holy Light Bloodline Essence?

“Chu Feng, you are also a greedy man, so stop making yourself sound nobler than you are. The only difference between us is that you are weak and powerless!”

After saying those words, Shengguang Yunyue flung her sleeves and swept Chu Feng up in the air using her martial power. She brought Chu Feng all the way to a forbidden ground inside the Holy Light Clan.

This forbidden ground was constructed underground. There were many defensive mechanisms along the way, and the security was extremely tight too. There were even Martial Exalted level cultivators stationed here to keep intruders away.

And the place where Shengguang Yunyue brought Chu Feng to was the deepest part of this forbidden ground. There was a dark temple there, which, despite its smaller size, emanated a tremendous amount of spirit power.

This dark temple itself was a massive formation, and the formation eye, which was located at the center of the formation, was divided into a Yin Formation and a Yang Formation.

Both formations were filled with medicinal fluid, which had a pungent smell that gushed out as soon as the doors to the dark temple were opened.

The Yin Formation was empty, but there was a young man sitting in the Yang Formation.

This young man was currently cultivating with his eyes closed, enhancing his body through absorbing the medicinal fluid around.

Shengguang Yu.

Upon sensing that someone had entered the area, Shengguang Yu opened his eyes to take a look. When he saw that it was Shengguang Yunyue bringing Chu Feng over, a smile merged on his lips.

“Lord Yunyue, has Chu Feng swallowed that medicine?” Shengguang Yu asked.

“Yes, he has already swallowed it. He’s nothing more than your cauldron now.”

Shengguang Yu replied as she tossed Chu Feng into the Yin Formation.

“Lord Yunyue, can this fellow really treat my injuries?” Shengguang Yu asked.

“I can’t guarantee it, but it’s worth a try. We’ll know the results two hours from now.”

After saying those words, Shengguang Yu turned around and left. She closed the doors to the hall behind her, leaving Chu Feng and Shengguang Yu alone in the dark temple.

“I never thought that such a day would come to you.”

Shengguang Yu looked at Chu Feng, who was struggling and crying in pain, with a mocking look on his face.

Even from the first time he saw Chu Feng, he was already filled with contempt for him. When he saw Chu Feng revealing his edge on the Storm Combat Dragon Ring, enjoying the respect and admiration of the masses, the fury in his heart only seemed to billow even more.

And finally, his rage could be all vented out. Chu Feng was going to die as fodder for him.

Weng!

Shortly after Shengguang Yu left, a huge burst of light illuminated this dark temple as the formation inscribed in here began to activate.

Seeing this, Shengguang Yu hurriedly closed his eyes and formed several hand seals so as to draw in the surrounding energy for his cultivation.

Wuuu!

But all of a sudden, Shengguang Yu felt something clutching tightly at his throat, stifling his breath. It all happened so suddenly that he immediately opened his eyes to see what was going on.

And to his horror, he saw Chu Feng, who was still thrashing around a moment ago, clutching his throat tightly. There was no longer any pained look on the latter’s face anymore, as if what he had seen earlier was just a lie.

Chu Feng had never been poisoned in the first place!

“You! How could this be?”

Shengguang Yu had realized the situation had gone amiss, and it left him deeply frightened and at a loss as to what to do.

“Young master Yu, you need not worry. I won’t kill you. After all, I’m relying on you to escort me out of here alive,” Chu Feng said with a smile.
