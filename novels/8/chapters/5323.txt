Chapter 5323: Miss Bai’s Cultivation

Chapter 5323: Miss Bai’s Cultivation

The white-haired woman had merely positioned herself in front of Chu Feng, but her movements didn’t escape Jia Chengying’s notice.

“Miss Bai, are you intending to fight us? Even if you barely manage to defeat me, it’s doubtful that you’ll be a match for my other two companions,” Jia Chengying said.

“Barely defeat you?” The white-haired woman looked at Jia Chengying as if he was a fool.

It was then that Chu Feng spoke up, “Everyone, there must be a reason behind us being split into groups, only to converge here in this hall. I suspect that we have to work together to breach this formation. Even if this is a competition, I don’t think we should start fighting now.” 

“Are you getting afraid, Chu Feng?” Jia Chengying asked with narrowed eyes.

Boom!

The white-haired woman suddenly unleashed her oppressive might, grandly displaying her prowess as a rank four Half-God level cultivator. She was telling Jia Chengying that she wasn’t afraid of him.

Her show of prowess didn’t faze Chu Feng by much, but Bai Yunqing was shocked. He didn’t think that she would be this powerful. Even the most talented prodigy of the Totem Galaxy, Long Chengyu, was only at rank three Half-God level before he went into closed-door training! 

The Bluemoon Palace’s Zhou Dong and the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Qin Shu also looked at the white-haired woman in a different light.

“Young miss, I didn’t expect you to be such a talented cultivator. May I know which sect you’re from?” Qin Shu asked.

The white-haired woman didn’t answer. 

Qin Shu didn’t mind it. He looked at her with an affable smile and asked, “Young miss, why don’t you come with us?” 

He was trying to poach the white-haired woman to his side right in front of Chu Feng’s eyes!

To his invitation, the white-haired woman coldly scoffed, “You aren’t worthy.”

“You!!!” Qin Shu’s face darkened in anger. “Do you think that you’re the only rank four Half-God level cultivator here? You aren’t the only prodigy here!”

Qin Shu also released his oppressive might, displaying his rank four Half-God level cultivation.

The white-haired woman didn’t reply to his outburst. Instead, she quietly released a red aura that raised her cultivation up to rank five Half-God level… and it didn’t just stop there. Blue and purple auras arose from her shortly after, changing her very disposition. At the same time, her cultivation shot up to rank six Half-God level.

“She’s able to raise her cultivation by two ranks despite being in Half-God level?” Jia Chengying’s expression turned awkward. 

He had previously crossed blows with the white-haired woman, only to fall in defeat. Back then, the white-haired woman had only raised her cultivation by a single rank, so he assumed that was the limitation of her ability. Yet, she was actually able to raise her cultivation by two ranks. 

He was also capable of raising his cultivation by two ranks, but his cultivation was only at rank three Half-God level. There was no way he could defeat the white-haired woman in his current state no matter how he struggled. 

“Miss Bai is indeed impressive. It looks like I have gotten ahead of myself.”

Sensing the white-haired woman’s strength, Qin Shu retracted his oppressive might. 

Chu Feng frowned at his response. He didn’t think that Qin Shu was backing down out of fear, which meant that the latter was probably up to something. 

“Chu Feng, Miss Bai, there’s something amiss,” Eggy said.

“What’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked.

“The auras that Miss Bai emanated to raise her cultivation earlier… They seem to have originated from a forbidden mysterious skill. This is weird. A prodigy of her caliber should have a decent bloodline power, so why didn’t she work on them instead of practicing a forbidden mysterious skill?” Eggy murmured.

Chu Feng thought that those words made sense, but he didn’t want to probe too much into the white-haired woman’s own personal affairs. “She probably has her own reasons for doing so.”

He then turned to Zhou Dong, Qin Shu, and Jia Chengying and asked with a frosty voice, “Do you want to join hands or not? If you don’t have to collaborate, we’ll just work on the formation separately.”

He was only making this proposal because he thought that this was the most efficient way to breach the formation before them, but if they weren’t interested in it, he wasn’t going to plead for their cooperation. 

“What you said earlier isn’t completely right. Yes, I do agree that we should join forces to breach this formation—that would be much more efficient—but there are likely to be clues useful for the subsequent trials inside the formation too. How much we decipher from the formation eventually boils down to our own capability. Ultimately, there’s no question that this is a competition,” the reticent Zhou Dong suddenly spoke up.

“So, what do you propose? Do you want to fight right now?” Chu Feng asked.

“That’s not what I mean. Just as you have mentioned earlier, the Ancient Realm must have its reason for splitting us into groups but have us converge here. I don’t think that it’s time for us to cross blows yet. Losing manpower at this point might put us in a disadvantageous position for the subsequent parts of the test. 

“There are four formation cores here. Why don’t we each dispatch two world spiritists to breach the formation? How much we decipher from the formation will be up to the individual,” Zhou Dong said.

“That’s fine by me,” Chu Feng agreed with the proposal.

He was inclined to collaborate with the other group at this juncture mainly because he hadn’t made a breakthrough to Half-God level yet. He would be in a disadvantageous position if they crossed blows right now. After all, Qin Shu was a fairly strong cultivator, and Zhou Dong wasn’t one to be underestimated either. They were top-notch prodigies towering above Bai Yunqing and Jia Chengying.

If a fight really broke out, Miss Bai would be the only one who could stand her ground in their group, and he didn’t want to heap that much stress on her. Thus, it would be wiser for them to collaborate for the time being.

“Big brother, I’ll go with you!” Bai Yunqing proactively volunteered himself.

“What do you think, Miss Bai?” Chu Feng asked the white-haired woman. 

He knew that she was strong, but he didn’t know whether she was a skilled world spiritist or not. Given that they were a team now, it wouldn’t be apt for him to arbitrarily make a decision without considering her view. 

“I’m lacking in world spiritist techniques. I’ll leave the formation to you two,” the white-haired woman replied via voice transmission. Her willingness to reveal her lack of proficiency for world spiritist technique showed how much she trusted him.

Chu Feng turned to Bai Yunqing and said, “Brother Bai, let’s work on the formation together.”

“I’ll heed your arrangements, big brother,” Bai Yunqing obediently replied.

The two of them made their way toward the gate. As they came close to the gate, four bundles of light suddenly manifested out of spirit power right before their eyes. These were the formation cores that Zhou Dong had told them about.

Naturally, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing had already known about them beforehand. With their discerning eyes as world spiritists, they had already long discovered the gate’s secrets.

The four formation cores meant that four world spiritists could simultaneously attempt to breach the formation, but it didn’t mean that the formation had to be breached by four people. It was just that the formation appeared to be a little tricky, so it wouldn’t hurt to have more manpower.  

“Which of you will be coming with me?” Zhou Dong looked at Qin Shu and Jia Chengying.

“Brother Jia should go. I’m lacking in terms of world spiritist techniques,” Qin Shu said.

Right after confirming his partner, Zhou Dong turned away and headed toward one of the formation cores. He had already revealed his prowess as a world spiritist before they entered the Ancient Realm. Just like Bai Yunqing, he was a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. 

Jia Chengying also entered one of the formation cores and exerted his spirit power. Surprisingly, he was also a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist!

But on second thought, Jia Chengying was a prodigy of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, which was known to have many formidable world spiritists. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that he was an accomplished world spiritist.

Jia Chengying looked at Chu Feng provocatively and said, “Chu Feng, are you going to breach the formation too? Don’t you think that you might be a burden to us?”

“My big brother’s skills are far better than you can imagine!” Bai Yunqing cried out.

Jia Chengying frowned, displeased to hear Bai Yunqing speaking up for Chu Feng. 

However, Bai Yunqing immediately sent him a voice transmission, saying, “Brother Jia, don’t be angry about that. I’m doing it on purpose to win Chu Feng’s trust.”

Jia Chengying’s anger dissipated upon hearing those words. He looked at Chu Feng with a tinge of sympathy in his eyes. You think that you have gotten yourself an obedient little brother. Just wait till he stabs a knife in your back!

Chu Feng paid no heed to Jia Chengying, knowing that there was no point in him wasting his breath. All he had to do was to silence them with his strength. Thus, he released his spirit power. 

“Hoh. You’re a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist? Not bad. Our strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator is skilled in world spiritist techniques?” Jia Chengying scoffed in contempt.

It was not that he didn’t think that Chu Feng was weak, but he simply prided himself on being stronger than the latter.

“Let’s begin.” Chu Feng ignored Jia Chengying and began constructing his formation. 

As soon as Chu Feng began making a move, everyone, with the exception of Bai Yunqing, widened their eyes in disbelief. They notice that Chu Feng’s spirit power was comparable to a rank two Half-God level cultivator. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was common for prodigies of their caliber to possess bloodlines that allowed them to raise their cultivation, but it was extremely rare for anyone to harness heaven-defying battle power when it came to spirit power. 

“That fellow is not to be underestimated.” Even Qin Shu also looked at Chu Feng in a new light.

Chu Feng soon completed his formation. Without any hesitation, he began using his formation to breach the gate.

The crowd opened their mouth in shock. They sensed that the prowess Chu Feng was exerting had further risen to a level comparable to Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists. 

“Am I seeing things? Is that fellow secretly a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist?” Jia Chengying asked aloud.
