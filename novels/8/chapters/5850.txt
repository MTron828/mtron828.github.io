Chapter 5851: The Choice of the Ancient Era’s Clans

The Ancient Era’s clans saw everything that happened too, and the clan leaders’ faces warped in savagery. The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief roared, “That bastard is openly challenging us.”

...

Just then, Chu Feng waved his sleeves, and several figures tumbled out. They were the top prodigies of the Ancient Era’s clans. Zhao Gongyi was among them too. However, all of them were skewered together by a single chain.

Chu Feng held the end of the chain in his hand. He shook the chain, and a loud rattling sound was produced alongside cries of agony. It was the cries of the Ancient Era’s top prodigies.

“What’s that bastard doing? Does he take our juniors to be livestock?” The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief raged.

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master and the others also revealed wrathful looks. Those juniors weren’t just the top prodigies of their clans; some of them were even their close kin. Yet, Chu Feng played with them as if they were no more than toys. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In contrast, those from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy were excited by that sight.

From the explanation of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect’s sectmaster, they learned that those skewered here were the Ancient Era’s top prodigies. They had tried to unravel their protective formation by attacking the formation core, but Chu Feng subdued them.

It was fortunate that they failed, or else that would have been a catastrophic blow to their Ancestral Martial Galaxy.

These prodigies were put in an awkward position due to Chu Feng.

“Kneel!”

Chu Feng tugged the chain, and all of the Ancient Era’s top prodigies kneeled neatly on the ground.

Their kneeling positions were peculiar. When a group of people kneeled in a row, they were aligned by the height of their knees. Yet, these people kneeled at different heights, with the largest Stone Hammer Monstrous Clansman kneeling at the lowest height.

The Ancient Era’s top prodigies were being aligned by their necks, as their necks had been strung across a chain,

“That bastard!” The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief couldn’t stand it anymore and marched out of the formation realm. He angrily roared to Chu Feng, “Little bastard, what are you trying to pull here?”

As Chu Feng was standing by the edge of the protective formation, and the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was massive, he could see the latter, and he could sense that it was an existence transcending True God level.

However, he wasn’t worried due to the protective formation. He clenched the chain even tighter than before and whipped out a formation blade. The formation blade swiftly extended until it was over ten thousand meters long.

He placed the formation blade on the necks of the juniors. It turned out he made them kneel in such a manner so that he could place his blade on their necks at the same time!

“Hand over your offensive formation if you don’t want them to die,” Chu Feng said.

“I’ll massacre your clan if you dare touch them!”

The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief got so close that the two of them were only divided by the protective formation. Its body was like an immense mountain before Chu Feng, and its voice was intimidating.

However, Chu Feng was unfazed. He snapped his finger, and an incense stick appeared in his hand. He sliced the incense stick such that only a tenth was left before lighting it up.

“I don’t fall for threats. Go back and discuss it among yourselves. Will you hand over the offensive formation and retreat, or have your top prodigies die here? I’ll give you a tenth of an incense’s time. They’ll be dead the moment the time's up,” Chu Feng said.

“You dare!”

The Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief glared at Chu Feng with eyes reminiscent of two moons viewed from close-up. Even its teeth were many times larger than him.

Yet, Chu Feng scoffed in the face of his threat, “You’ll know whether I dare or not once time’s up.”

“Save me, grandfather! I don’t want to die!”

“Lord Clan Chief, please save me!”

Pleading voices echoed from the top prodigies, including Zhao Gongyi. They had seen what Chu Feng had done, and they knew that he was capable of doing anything.

“Shut up! Aren’t you embarrassed to be begging for your lives before a cultivator of the present era?” the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief roared at the Ancient Era’s top prodigies.

“He’s capable of doing it,” a voice transmission was relayed to the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.

The other five Ancient Era’s clan leaders received the voice transmission too. It was from Puppeteer Exalted.

“Puppeteer Exalted, do you have a way to save them?”

The clan leaders turned to Puppeteer Exalted. They could give up on the other juniors, but those people whom Chu Feng was holding hostage weren’t just their top prodigies but their close kin too.

“There’s only one way to save them, and that’s to hand over the offensive formation.”

The six Ancient Era’s clan leaders turned grim. In other words, Puppeteer Exalted was saying there was no way to save their top prodigies.

“The choice is in your hands. I can hand over the offensive formation, but it’ll be impossible to gather all of the items again. If we give up on this opportunity, we’ll never be able to breach the Ancestral Martial Galaxy’s protective formation and access their treasures,” Puppeteer Exalted said.

The Ancient Era’s clan leaders hesitated, including the Stone Hammer Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. They had come so far that they were reluctant to give up on it. In the first place, they had only come together due to the massive temptation of the treasure.

“Puppeteer Exalted, are you certain of success?” the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master asked.

“I’ll offer you my head if I fail,” Puppeteer Exalted replied.

The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master turned his eyes away from the protective formation. This gesture revealed his decision.

“Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master, are you going to give up on your grandson?” the Blood Phoenix Royal Clan’s Clan Chief asked.

“You have seen Chu Feng’s means. He’s not a coward. Why do you think he massacred our other clansmen, only to spare the lives of our top prodigies? He planned to threaten us right from the start. In truth, our juniors were already dead from the moment they lost to Chu Feng. They weren’t strong enough, so they paid the price for it.” The Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master sighed before closing his eyes.

His beloved grandson was among the hostages. It wasn’t an easy decision for him to make.

The others fell silent. It was not that they agreed with the Seven Realms Immortal Pavilion’s Pavilion Master, but between their top prodigies and the future of their clans, they chose the latter.
