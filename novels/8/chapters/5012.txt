Chapter 5012: Blocking the Path

“Young master Chu Feng, we still have matters to attend to so we’ll take our leave first. I hope to meet you once more in the future,” Chu Guyu said.

Her words left the disciples of the Heavenwind Sword Sect feeling conflicted even though they were aware that there was something special about Chu Feng. This was especially so for the number one disciple, Li Han. He didn’t feel well seeing the person he fancied treating Chu Feng so amicably.

He gnashed his teeth, and his face distorted from anger.

Chu Guyu left afterward, but not before bidding Chu Feng farewell and greeting the Netherworld Envoy. She must have thought that given how formidable Chu Feng was, the elder accompanying him must be someone extraordinary too.

Little did Chu Guyu know that Chu Feng was undergoing an internal struggle. He was tempted to borrow the strength of the Heavenwind Sword Sect to deal with the Netherworld Envoy.

While he didn’t think that the Netherworld Envoy was a thoroughly evil person, he didn’t want to go to the Netherworld Sect just yet. He wanted to save Xian Miaomiao first.

It was just that he didn’t think that the Heavenwind Sword Sect would do him this favor, considering that it was only their first meeting. If he failed, the Netherworld Envoy might just get more guarded against him.

That would make things much harder for Chu Feng in the future.

While he was still conflicted between his options, Chu Guyu and the others from the Heavenwind Sword Sect left the premises.

With that, Chu Feng’s opportunity was gone.

There were quite a few people who approached Chu Feng, hoping to get on good terms with him as well as to find out his background. It was just that these people were not strong enough to help him.

Not to mention, most of them simply sided with whichever side was advantageous to them. This was evident from how they acted earlier.

Chu Feng didn’t think that he could count on such people, so he simply politely responded to them, not bothering to engage them in a conversation.

“Young hero, we’ll be leaving now. You’re a good person. Kindness begets kindness.”

“That’s right, big brother. You’ll be rewarded for your kindness!”

Soon, the father and son who finished their Dragon Spring walked up to Chu Feng and bade their farewell.

“Little brother, you have a good father. You must be filial to him in the future,” Chu Feng said with a smile.

“I will,” the little boy promised with a bright smile.

The father and son left afterward.

Chu Feng watched their departing silhouette. Even though the two of them were dressed shabbily, he could feel a deep kinship between them.

He returned to his seat afterward, only to see that the two bowls of Dragon Spring had been emptied. The Netherworld Envoy was staring at him.

“Should we leave since we’re done drinking?” Chu Feng asked.

The Netherworld Envoy ignored Chu Feng and instead beckoned the waiter over.

“Two more bowls of Dragon Spring.”

He smacked another twenty Dragon Spring Coins on the table.

When another two bowls of Dragon Spring were served to them, the Netherworld Envoy pushed one of them toward Chu Feng and said, “I’ve really underestimated you. It looks like the True Dragon Chessboard doesn’t pose a challenge to you at all. Can I have a look at the Dragon Breath Token?”

It was apparent that the Netherworld Envoy had a much higher view of Chu Feng as well after the latter deciphered the True Dragon Chessboard.

“If you like it, you can have it.”

Chu Feng passed the Dragon Breath Token to the Netherworld Envoy.

“You’re giving it to me? There must be conditions behind it, right?”

The Netherworld Envoy examined the Dragon Breath Token as a wily smile crept onto his lips.

“Elder, I promise you that I’ll accompany you back to the Netherworld Sect. It’s just that my friend is in trouble. I can’t turn a blind eye to her plight. Please allow me to return to resolve my affairs. I’ll willingly come with you afterward.”

Chu Feng didn’t want to cause a commotion, so he spoke those words via voice transmission.

“This token doesn’t look like anything much, but it is made out of special material. Still, there isn’t anything particularly special about it. I reckon it’s just a memento. You may keep it.”

The Netherworld Envoy passed the token back to Chu Feng, not answering the latter’s question. His intent was already made clear. He opposed Chu Feng’s decision to remain in the Nine Souls Galaxy. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Chu Feng felt frustrated by his response, so he decided to ignore the Netherworld Envoy. Nevertheless, he still picked up the bowl of Dragon Spring and began drinking it. He had no intention of wasting good stuff like that.

“Alright, it has been a fruitful trip, but it’s time for us to continue on our journey.”

The Netherworld Envy stretched his back lazily before leaving together with Chu Feng.

Nothing much happened along the way, but the Netherworld Envoy suddenly halted his footsteps. He glanced at the surroundings and spoke aloud, “You have been following us for a while now. What are your intentions?”

Shoosh shoosh shoosh!

Many figures darted out from the shadows to appear before Chu Feng and the Netherworld Envoy. They were all from the Heavenwind Sword Sect, and one of them was Li Han.

Not all of them were in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber earlier, especially the black-haired elder with a vicious face standing beside Li Han. Nevertheless, the black-haired elder gave off an extremely powerful aura.

He was a Half-God level cultivator!

This was not the first time Chu Feng was feeling the aura of a Half-God level cultivator, but he was still awed by how powerful Half-God level cultivators were. Those were experts who could easily obliterate him.

“What do you mean by this?” the Netherworld Envoy asked.

“What do I mean by this? Haven’t you seen what happened in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber earlier? Did you really think that you can take possession of our Heavenwind Sword Sect so easily?” Li Han asked.

“Isn’t it just twenty Dragon Spring Coins? I have two Exalted Armaments here. I’ll give them to you as compensation.”

The Netherworld Envoy took out two Exalted Armaments and tossed them to Li Han. However, someone stopped them halfway through their trajectory. It was Chu Feng.

“I won those two bowls of Dragon Spring with my own capabilities. There’s no reason to give that to them,” Chu Feng said.

“Hoh! It looks like you have quite the backbone. Let’s see if you can keep it up with your bravado. Chu Feng, I’ll turn a blind eye to the trickery you used earlier if you have a 1-on-1 spar with me. If you’re able to defeat me, I’ll let you go and even apologize to you. However, if you aren’t able to defeat me, you’ll have to apologize to me,” Li Han said.
