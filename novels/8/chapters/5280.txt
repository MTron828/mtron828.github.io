Chapter 5280: Defeat!

Shoosh!

The black aura in the sky suddenly billowed, and numerous black chains fell from the sky to block their path. Even those who had barely managed to slip through the opening found themselves surrounded by another fresh set of black chains.

As powerful as Long Zhen was, he couldn’t break through the black chains without Long Junlin’s help. Thus, he turned around to look at Long Junlin.

“This is bad.” Long Junlin frowned.

Not only were Long Zhen and the others trapped, but countless black chains had also begun surging toward the sky too. The demon monk was going to seal off the entire realm again.

The earlier Totem Dragon Breath was his strongest attack, and using it once had already taken a toll on him. It was difficult for him to unleash it once more.

“How did this happen?”

Long Junlin felt helpless. Their clansmen had already sacrificed their lives to stall the demon monk, but the demon monk still had enough strength to seal off the opening he had just created. He couldn’t believe just how powerful the demon monk was.

Shoosh!

All of a sudden, a black chain fell from the sky and headed straight toward Long Zhen. Unlike the massive ones used to seal off the realm, this black chain was extremely slim, reminiscent of the ones that ordinary humans used. However, it was imbued with a purple flame that gave off a dangerous vibe.

It was an extremely evil power.

“Damn it!”

Long Zhen raised his Saint Dragon Shield to ward off the black chain.

Boom!

Shockingly, the Saint Dragon Shield shattered upon contact with the chain.

While Long Zhen was still coming to terms with the situation, the black chain had already impaled his body, rendering him completely powerless. He slumped onto the ground, unable to move at all.

“What is that?”

Even Long Junlin’s heart clenched up when he saw the purple flames shrouding the black chain, let alone the others.

“Hahaha! Brother Ren, are you finally done?” The demon monk laughed loudly.

“The demon monk has a helper?” Long Junlin widened his eyes in realization.

He had known that the demon monk had a helper—the mysterious woman had already warned them about it—but he didn’t think that the demon monk’s helper would be this powerful.

Shoosh!

Countless black chains suffused with purple flames fell from the sky, and their targets were the Totem Dragon Clansmen

Gah!

Miserable cries echoed in the sky.

Within seconds, nearly every single Totem Dragon Clansmen who were still fighting in the sky had been impaled by the black chains, Even those who had already breathed their last weren’t spared from the tragedy.

Just like that, the massive army of the Totem Dragon Clan had been utterly defeated, with the only survivors being Long Junlin and the three other Nine Flags Dragon Warriors. Even so, it didn’t take long for the demon monk to impale those three Nine Flags Dragon Warriors with the black chains suffused with purple flames.

With that, Long Junlin was the last one standing. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Countless black chains shot toward Long Junlin from all directions, but Long Junlin reverted to his original body and released a burst of golden aura. With his sheer strength, he was able to stop the black chains in their tracks.

“Give up, Long Junlin.”

The demon monk descended to stand before Long Junlin. He grabbed one of the black chains and infused his power into it. Then, he tossed it out like a javelin.

Shoosh!

Long Junlin’s golden aura disintegrated in the face of the demon monk’s attack. Even with his incredible strength, he could only watch helplessly as the black chain pierced into his body. Strength seeped from his body, and he collapsed to the ground.

With that, the Totem Dragon Clan had finally fallen in defeat.

Following that, all of the Totem Dragon Clansmen suddenly let out anguished howls. The purple flames had slipped into their bodies like parasites to siphon their energy.

There were courageous cultivators who flew toward Long Zhen, hoping to save him by severing the black chain, but to their despair, they couldn’t even inflict a single scratch on the black chain. It was nigh indestructible.

“What a powerful formation. It won’t make a difference even if the two of us make a move,” Mo Chengzhou said.

“The black chain formation that sealed off the realm isn’t the demon monk’s doing. Someone else is behind it. That being said, the flames that siphon energy are clearly the demon monk’s work. He is much stronger than he used to be,” Ningyu Shangren said.

“What should we do?” Mo Chengzhou asked.

“Let’s just watch the situation for the time being. If we are really forced to a corner, we’ll have no choice but to reveal our identities,” Ningyu Shangren said.

“But the demon monk is a heinous villain who doesn’t hesitate to take the lives of others. Is there any chance that he’ll spare us?” Mo Chengzhou asked.

“I’m not optimistic about it either. All we can really do is to pray,” Ningyu Shangren said.

“Pray? Pray for what?”

“Pray for a miracle.”

Mo Chengzhou’s lips twitched.

“I wouldn’t have come here if I knew that things would turn out like this,” he muttered regretfully.

Meanwhile, in the red tower, Chu Feng had just defeated his opponent on the sixteenth floor, which was a golden monster. Interestingly, the previous opponents he had defeated would usually leave a carcass behind, but the golden monster morphed into a golden aura that first dispersed before converging to form a golden box.

This golden box was identical to the ones located at the peak of the other four towers.

At the same time, the glowing woman’s voice echoed, “Chu Feng, by this point, you have already cleared the test at this point. You now have the option to take this golden box to ensure your own survival, but it’ll also spell the end of your challenge. Should you open this golden box, the tower will dissipate.”

Chu Feng frowned. He looked outside the tower, where Long Xiaoxiao was standing next to the glowing woman.

“Elder, I wish to continue the test,” Chu Feng said.

“This option will not be offered to you a second time. Should you fail to clear the tower, not only will you be unable to save Long Xiaoxiao, but you’ll also lose your life too. The final test is not something you’re able to clear in your current state,” the glowing woman said.

“Elder, I understand the rules, but I wish to continue the challenge.”

Chu Feng walked past the golden box and headed to the next floor. Upon seeing that, the glowing woman chuckled softly.

“Elder, did something good happen?” Long Xiaoxiao asked out of curiosity.

“Not at all. I just think that you have a good eye for people,” the glowing woman replied.

Long Xiaoxiao smiled sweetly upon hearing those words. While she couldn’t see what was happening inside the tower, she could tell from the glowing woman’s words that Chu Feng was doing well.

Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already reached the final floor.

Just like before, a figure was guarding the stairway to the next floor. While this figure didn’t have any distinctive facial features, Chu Feng could tell that its clothes and posture were identical to his. Furthermore, it was wielding a sword that resembled his Immemorial Hero’s Sword.

An ominous feeling welled up in his heart.

He chose not to engage it in close-quarter combat but instead executed a martial skill—Bow of Hundred Transformations.

Shoosh!

The figure dodged his arrow and retaliated with the same move, but it shot numerous arrows at once.

Chu Feng was able to easily dodge the barrage of arrows, but his complexion turned grim.

“It’s indeed a mirror image,” he thought with a sigh.

The figure was clearly an opponent who possessed similar capabilities as him. He had encountered similar opponents before, so he knew that such opponents were the trickiest to deal with.

However, there was no room to retreat now.

Chu Feng proceeded to clash with his mirror image opponent. The fight quickly escalated, and it didn’t take long for him to unleash his strongest means, from the Lightning Mark, the Lightning Armor, to the Four Symbols Divine Power, but he was still unable to claim victory.

It was only to be expected since his opponent also possessed the same means too.

To make things worse, his injuries kept piling on whereas his opponent was able to quickly heal up. It was almost impossible to win such a battle!

Fortunately, he swiftly figured out that his mirror image opponent would only attack when he was within a given radius. Once he was out of the attacking radius, his opponent would terminate its aggression.

Chu Feng chose to back off and rest up for a moment first. He glanced outside and saw that the incense stick was on the verge of burning out. He knew that he didn’t have much time left.

His eyes hardened in determination.

“Chu Feng, you mustn’t use the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes. He’ll only copy your move. Even if you’re able to kill him with it, it’ll be the same the other way around too,” Eggy advised.

“I don’t have any other options. I can only bet on him being unable to execute the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes,” Chu Feng replied.

The Totem Dragon Clan had already been defeated. If he wanted to survive, he had to defeat his opponent and claim the token at the peak of the tower.

Unfortunately, his spirit power was sealed off inside this tower, so he could only rely on his martial power. The only way he could think of to defeat his mirror image opponent was to execute the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.

Weng!

Suddenly, there was a flicker of white light. The glowing woman had entered the tower.

Chu Feng looked out of the window and saw that there was another glowing woman still standing next to Long Xiaoxiao.

There are two glowing women?

“Who are you?” Chu Feng asked the glowing woman who had appeared inside the tower.

“Have you become dumb? It’s me,” the glowing woman replied.

Upon hearing the voice, Chu Feng realized that the glowing woman inside the tower was just a clone.

“Elder, isn’t this overboard? How could you make me face myself?” he sighed.

“I’ve already warned you, but you refused to listen. It’s too late for regrets now. You’ll have to defeat it if you wish to survive,” the glowing woman said.

“Elder, aren’t you the one who calls the shots here? Can’t you make a special exception?”

“I am indeed the one who calls the shots here, but I have principles,” the glowing woman replied.

Chu Feng sighed helplessly upon hearing those words.

The glowing woman chuckled and asked, “Chu Feng, do you wish to live?”

“Of course,” Chu Feng replied.

“Do you know why you’re unable to defeat your mirror image?” she asked.

“It’s because I haven’t become any stronger than before. If I’m able to become stronger, I’ll be able to defeat him.”

Chu Feng had faced a similar situation before, where he had to face a mirror image opponent who possessed the same strength and skills as him. Back then, he had defeated the opponent by growing stronger, but he clearly didn’t have the luxury of time to do so now.
