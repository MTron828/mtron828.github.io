MGA: Chapter 1628 - Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet

Inside the Nangong Imperial Clan, on a mountain peak that penetrated through the clouds, stood a very magnificent building. Standing on top of that building, one could overlook the entire Nangong Imperial Clan and have a panoramic view of the vast building complex.

At this moment, a middle-aged man was standing on top of this building. He was wearing the apparel of the Nangong Imperial Clan, and he emitted the extraordinary aura of a monarch.

This person was the Nangong Imperial Clan’s current Clan Chief, Nangong Beidou. He was a rank three Martial Emperor.

At this moment, there were two men standing behind him. The two of them were both people from the Nangong Imperial Clan. Furthermore, they were both Martial Emperors. Merely, when compared to Nangong Beidou, the two of them appeared to be a lot weaker. After all, they only possessed cultivations of rank one Martial Emperors.

Perhaps they could be considered as top level experts in the Holy Land of Martialism, existences akin to gods. However, when standing beside Nangong Beidou, they appeared to be extremely tiny.

These two men were, respectively, Nangong Huayi and Nangong Rongsheng. They were Nangong Beidou’s two trusted aides.

Presently, there were sixty-one old men standing opposite Nangong Beidou. These sixty-one old men were all wearing royal world spiritist cloaks.

Sixty among them had snake-like veined patterns moving through their royal world spiritist cloaks. As for the leader of the group, his royal world spiritist cloak actually possessed dragon-like veined patterns.

This old man was not only a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, he also possessed the cultivation of a rank two Martial Emperor.

Furthermore, he had a very distinguished appearance. Even though he had a head full of black hair, he had a pair of white eyebrows. Furthermore, his eyebrows were very eye-catching; they were extremely long. As his eyebrows dangled downward, they actually reached his heels.

Evidently, this person was one of the Holy Land of Martialism’s famous Ten Immortals, White-browed Immortal.

“Congratulations Brother White-browed, on finally breaking through,” Nangong Beidou congratulated him as he smiled.

“This old man was only able to break through to rank two Martial Emperor with the thanks of Clan Chief Nangong’s help,” White-browed Immortal said with a smile.

“We are already family now. If you still act this courteously toward me, you will truly be regarding me as an outsider,” Nangong Beidou said.

“Clan Chief Nangong, you don’t have to worry about this. Even though my bunch of friends and I are merely nominal elders here, we will definitely do our utmost for the Nangong Imperial Clan,” White-browed Immortal promised.

“It is the fortune of our Nangong Imperial Clan to obtain the assistance of White-browed Immortal and the various world spiritists. Please rest assured, I will definitely obtain the thing that you all need as soon as possible,” Nangong Beidou said.

Suddenly, a peak Half Martial Emperor level Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist asked, “Lord Clan Chief, I have heard of rumors of one thing. I wonder if that rumor is true or not.”

“There’s no harm in asking,” Nangong Beidou said.

“I have heard that when the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan who possess the densest Imperial Bloodline reach a breakthrough, they will cause an abnormal sign of a golden dragon to break through the skies. This abnormal sign will be so spectacular that it will be much more magnificent than the abnormal signs caused by Divine Bodies. Lord Clan Chief, is that true or not?” The man asked.

“Divine Bodies are inferior to us Imperial Bloodlines to begin with. Thus, that rumor is naturally true,” Nangong Beidou replied complacently.

“In that case, Lord Clan Chief, might there be anyone in the Nangong Imperial Clan who has managed to create such an abnormal sign?” The man continued to ask.

“Heh, not to mention people of our generation, even the younger generation, my sons and daughter, are also capable of that,” Nangong Beidou replied.

“That would be truly great. I have seen the abnormal sign caused by Divine Bodies several times, and I have wanted to see the abnormal sign caused by Imperial Bloodlines for a long time now. Finally, the opportunity to do so has presented itself,” Hearing what Nangong Beidou said, the man became extremely excited. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Speaking of it, this old man has never seen the Imperial Bloodline’s abnormal sign either. Now that I’ve heard you all talking about it, I too wish to experience it,” White-browed Immortal said with a smile.

“If Immortal wishes to see the abnormal sign caused by those who possess Imperial Bloodlines, it would not be too hard either. As far as I know, His Highness the Third Prince is about to break through. I believe that he will be able to break through in the coming days,” One of the rank one Martial Emperors behind Nangong Beidou, Nangong Huayi, said.

Not only was Nangong Huayi one of Nangong Beidou’s trusted aides, he was also in charge of protecting the Third Prince, Nangong Tianshi. It could be said that whenever the Third Prince left the Nangong Imperial Clan, Nangong Huayi would always follow him.

Thus, Nangong Huayi knew the state of the Third Prince even better than his father Nangong Beidou.

“Huayi, Tianshi is really about to breakthrough?” Nangong Beidou asked.

“Reporting to Lord Clan Chief, His Highness the Third Prince is about to break through. He will definitely break through within a month’s time,” Nangong Huayi replied.

“Since White-browed Immortal wishes to see, there’s no need for us to wait. Have Tianshi break through today,” As Nangong Beidou spoke, he took out a golden medicinal pellet.

Right after that golden medicinal pellet appeared, a very strong natural energy immediately spread out from it. Upon closer inspection, one could see that there was a golden dragon galloping within that golden medicinal pellet.

That was the Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet. It did not possess any trace of berserk energy. However, it contained a very dense and strong natural energy. The Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet was a treasure. Especially to those who possessed Inherited Bloodlines, the Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet was a godly cultivation medicine.

As Nangong Huayi saw the Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet, his eyes shone. He felt joy for the Third Prince. Immediately afterward, he hurriedly received it from Nangong Beidou. Then, with a movement of his body, he left the building and directly arrived at the Eldest Prince Nangong Tianlong’s territory.

“Uncle Huayi, what brings you here?”

At that moment, everyone from the Nangong Imperial Clan, including that Meng Xiaoyan, were still there. They were all surprised to see Nangong Huayi’s arrival.

“Eldest Prince, White-browed Immortal has said that he wishes to see the abnormal sign caused when someone from our Nangong Imperial Clan manages to break through.”

“Lord Clan Chief had heard that His Highness Third Prince is about to break through. Thus, he has bestowed a Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet for His Highness Third Prince to use to train with so that he can break through today, and the White-browed Immortal and the other world spiritists could have a feast for their eyes,” As Nangong Huayi spoke, he took out the Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet.

“Third brother, you are truly fortunate. You actually managed to have Lord Father personally bestow you a Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet. You must know that I have begged him for a Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet for a very long time, yet Lord Father refuses to give me one regardless.” Seeing that Coiling Dragon Golden Pellet, Fourth Princess Nangong Tianfeng was extremely jealous.

When even she had become jealous, the other people from the Nangong Imperial Clan present were naturally incomparably jealous. They were all on the verge of drooling.

Golden Coiling Dragon Pellets were treasures that not even princes and princesses could use as they wished. Thus, for the rest of them, they would simply have no chance to obtain a Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet.

“So that’s the case. Tianshi, take this along with the pellet,” After learning of what was happening, Nangong Tianlong took out a golden medicinal pellet and handed it to Nangong Tianshi.

“Thank you big brother. Big brother, you are truly good to me. Hehe...” When Nangong Tianshi saw the medicinal pellet handed to him by Nangong Tianlong, he started to grin from ear to ear. The value of the medicinal pellet his big brother had handed him could be said to be on par with the Golden Coiling Dragon Pellet. It was also a treasure of the Nangong Imperial Clan.

Upon taking that medicinal pellet, the abnormal sign one would cause when obtaining a breakthrough would be exceptionally magnificent and powerful. When that abnormal sign returned into one’s body, one’s Inherited Bloodline would also strengthen. That medicinal pellet was a treasure that countless people in the Nangong Imperial Clan longed for.

“We are blood brothers. There’s no need for you to regard me as an outsider. Go, train properly so that you can reach a breakthrough tonight. You also know that the soaring golden dragon is most spectacular at night.”

Nangong Tianlong patted Nangong Tianshi’s shoulder. Even though he was extremely harsh toward outsiders, he was extremely loving toward his blood younger brother.
