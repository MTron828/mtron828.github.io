Chapter 3109 - Heavenly Fate Stage‚Äôs Heavenly Fate Palace

Upper Realms; two hundred thirty-two in total.

Ordinary Realms; three thousand six hundred sixty-eight in total.

Lower Realms; a hundred and three thousand two hundred and twenty-six in total.

The Upper Realms, Ordinary Realms and Lower Realms, each and every one of them, were planetary stars floating in the vast starry sky.

Those hundred thousand-plus stars formed a Starfield.

That Starfield was the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, all of the planetary stars were ruled by various powers. Only a small number of planetary stars did not belong to any power of influence, and were not under the administration of the Starfield Master Realm.

Among these was a planetary star by the name of Heavenly Fate Planet. Heavenly Fate Planet belonged to a single person.

That person was called Exalted Heavenly Fate.

It was due to the fact that Exalted Heavenly Fate was on Heavenly Fate Planet that no individual and no power dared go to Heavenly Fate Planet and cause trouble.

Although Exalted Heavenly Fate was very powerful and a top level expert, he was not one of the strongest individuals in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Because of that, the reason why he held such status in the Ancestral Martial Starfield was not because of his martial prowess. Instead, it was because he possessed a special sort of power, the power of prophecy.

Exalted Heavenly Fate‚Äôs prophecies were extremely accurate. Never once had he been mistaken.

All of his prophecies would end up coming true.

Furthermore, Exalted Heavenly Fate was asked by the Starfield Master Realm to make a prophecy for them every year.

Through his prophecies, they would gather information about the upcoming changes to the Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Now it was once again the time of Exalted Heavenly Fate‚Äôs yearly prophecy for the Starfield Master Realm.

It was currently nighttime. The vast sky was completely open, with no clouds to be seen within ten thousand miles. The stars were all present.

Rivers of stars were presented to one‚Äôs naked eye. Such scenery was truly beautiful.

Deep within the sky was a stage. The stage was so tall that it seemed to pierce through the sky and reach the gathered stars.

Three large words were written on the stage. It was its name, the Heavenly Fate Stage.

On top of the Heavenly Fate Stage was a palace, the Heavenly Fate Palace.

The Heavenly Fate Palace was not very large. However, it was very peculiar. Its walls were transparent like crystal. As the starlight illuminated its walls, it reflected the stars in the sky. It was as if the stars that covered the sky were all inside the palace.

Precisely because the Heavenly Fate Palace was transparent, everything inside the Heavenly Fate Palace was visible to the naked eye.

The Heavenly Fate Palace was very vast and open. Apart from a writing desk, there was no other furniture.

The writing desk was located in the center of the Heavenly Fate Palace. A crystalline body of light was placed on top of the writing desk.

The crystalline body of light was only a foot tall. However, its appearance was very peculiar. It looked exactly the same as the Heavenly Fate Palace.

That said, compared to the Heavenly Fate Palace, that crystalline body of light was even more peculiar. From a glance, one could tell that it was extraordinary.

Starlight had filled the crystalline body of light. This starlight was so densely concentrated that it appeared as if the entire starry sky had been absorbed into the crystalline body of light. Looking at it, one would exclaim in admiration.

Before the writing desk knelt a person.

That person was wearing a black gown. That black gown was covered with specks of starlight. It was as if that black gown was not a black gown, but a portion of the vast starry sky.

That said, the black gown was most definitely not the most eye-catching aspect of that individual. Most eye-catching of all was the long black hair that was draped over that individual‚Äôs back.

That black hair was floating in midair, and was actually over a hundred meters in length. That individual‚Äôs hair resembled a black dragon floating around his body.

One could not see that individual‚Äôs face. That was because he was wearing a mask. The mask was also black. That said, when compared to the black gown on his body, the mask was purely black, and did not appear to be peculiar at all.

At that moment, that person was kneeling before the writing desk with his fingers interwoven. He was making special hand seals.

That individual was the greatly renowned individual throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, the owner of Heavenly Fate Planet, Exalted Heavenly Fate.

Exalted Heavenly Fate was currently seeing through the secrets of the heavens and making a prophecy of the future.

Outside the Heavenly Fate Palace, outside the Heavenly Fate Stage, were many people. They were all standing in midair.

Those people were standing there in an orderly manner. They looked like guards guarding the Heavenly Fate Stage.

Those people were all extraordinary existences. Many among them were grand existences, famous throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.

Many of them were from the overlord powers of various Upper Realms. Of course, there were also people among them that did not belong to any power, and were instead old monsters with enormous power.

That said, the most eye-catching individuals among those people were a group of people wearing black gowns.

Those people were gathered together. Everyone else, regardless of their status and identity, would subconsciously keep their distance from that group of black-gowned individuals. In fact, they even had traces of fear in their eyes as they looked at the black-gowned individuals.

The black gowns that they wore were also filled with specks of starlight. That said, their black gowns were different from Exalted Heavenly Fate‚Äôs black gown.

To put it simply, Exalted Heavenly Fate‚Äôs black gown gave off a mysterious sensation.

As for that group of people, their black gowns gave off a domineering, unstoppable and dangerous sensation.

Although the group were wearing grim-looking outfits, they all had impressive facial appearances. Both the men and the women, old and young, were all extraordinary in appearance. They truly could all be considered to be handsome men and beautiful women.

This was especially true for their skin. Not only was their skin exquisite, but it was also snow-white. They were so white that they seemed inhuman. G√™tt the latest chùíÇpters on nùíê/velbin(.)com

No, they seemed inhuman because they were not humans to begin with.

Although their facial features were all the same as those of humans, one would be able to see that their eyes were filled with starlight should one pay close attention. It was as if there were galaxies swirling in their eyes.

Those were definitely not human eyes.

That group of strange people not only emitted extraordinary airs, but their identities were also extraordinary.

They were people from the Starfield Master Realm. They... were from the Nameless Clan, the overlord of the Starfield Master Realm, the ruler of the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. [Nameless Clan ‚Üí Wuming Clan.]

That said, even though there were so many grand characters present, no one was making a fuss about it.

Everyone seemed to have reached a tacit understanding, and was quietly staring at the Heavenly Fate Stage, at Exalted Heavenly Fate.

‚ÄúBuzz~~~‚Äù

Suddenly, change began to occur to the crystalline body of light. The flickering starlight began to dissipate. The crystalline body of light turned pitch-black. Following that, the pitch-blackness also disappeared. One was no longer able to see anything inside that crystalline body of light. At that moment it resembled an ordinary crystal.

At the same time, the black gown that Exalted Heavenly Fate wore also turned pitch-black. The starlight on the gown had dissipated together with the starlight in the crystalline body of light.

At that moment, the pitch-black gown was quite matching for that pitch-black mask.

witnessing such a scene, the crowd became slightly emotional. At the same time, they started to feel a slight bit of unease.

They knew that Exalted Heavenly Fate had finished with his prophecy. However, no one knew exactly what Exalted Heavenly Fate‚Äôs prophecy would be about.

Because of this, they were looking forward to the prophecy, and yet, feeling uneasy.

They did not know if the coming information would be good or bad.

Before the looks of anticipation from the crowd, Exalted Heavenly Fate opened his eyes. He stood up, walked out the Heavenly Fate Palace and arrived on the Heavenly Fate Stage.

After coming out of the Heavenly Fate Stage, Exalted Heavenly Fate did not say anything. Instead, he clasped his fist at the crowd gathered outside and bowed respectfully.

At that moment, the eldest individual amongst the group from the Starfield Master Realm asked, ‚ÄúLord Heavenly Fate. Exactly what did the prophecy say this time around?‚Äù
