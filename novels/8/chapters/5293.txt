Chapter 5293: Situ Kunye’s Strength

“Chu Feng, what do you plan to do?” Eggy asked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I’ll head there to take a look,” Chu Feng replied.

“All right, let’s do that,” Eggy replied.

Chu Feng wasn’t strong enough to go against the Situ World Spiritist Clan yet, but his grandmother’s kin was as good as his own kin. How could he tolerate having his kin’s remains hung up in front of the Situ World Spiritist Clan?

Whether Chu Feng decided to fight against the Situ World Spiritist Clan or not, Eggy would go into it with him.

…

Chu Feng soon arrived at the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s headquarters.

Many people were gathered here, and more people were arriving with each passing second. They had heard about how the Situ World Spiritist Clan had hung up the remains of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect’s members, so they came over to watch the commotion.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan also implicitly permitted them to do so in order to rebuild their dignity as the True Dragon Galaxy’s overlord.

The crowd wondered if Chu Feng would confront the Situ World Spiritist Clan or not. After all, this was clearly an act of provocation directed at Chu Feng.

Aren’t you trying to exact vengeance? Our Situ World Spiritist Clan has already gathered all of our sect members together for you to slaughter. If you don’t come, your ancestors from the Golden Dragon Flame Sect will never be able to rest in peace… and that’ll be all your fault, Chu Feng.

The Situ World Spiritist Clan was forcing Chu Feng to make a choice here.

There was no doubt that a trap was awaiting Chu Feng in the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s headquarters, but if he chose to ignore it, his reputation would fall into shambles. The crowd would think of him as nothing more than a paper tiger who bullied the weaklings but cowered before the experts of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

…

Chu Feng paid no heed to the discussions of the crowd and raced straight toward the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s headquarters.

The gates of the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s headquarters were wide open, but what was even more shocking were the tens of thousands of corpses hanging before the gates. These corpses were mostly mutilated, giving a glimpse into the horrors they had experienced before death.

There were far more people in the Golden Dragon Flame Sect than just the ones hanging here, but most of them had been reduced to ashes in the battle back then.

Noticing a lack of response from Chu Feng, Eggy worriedly asked, “Chu Feng, are you all right?”

“I’m fine. I know that this is a trap they have laid for me. I would have lived my life in vain if I foolishly stepped in it without careful planning,” Chu Feng said.

He was indescribably enraged. These were the close kin of his grandmother, but the Situ World Spiritist Clan was humiliating them by hanging their remains up in the open. There was no way he could tolerate that.

But he knew that he had to hold it in.

It was not that he had chosen to cower before the might of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. Had that been the case, he wouldn’t have even taken the risk to come here. Rather, he wanted to find an opportunity to either defeat the Situ World Spiritist Clan or at least take these remains away.

Thus, he bowed deeply to the remains and said, “Elders, I swear that I’ll take you away and give you a proper burial so that you’ll be able to rest in peace. I’ll lop off the heads of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen and place them before your graves so as to appease your souls.”

With that, he began making his way into the Situ World Spiritist Clan.

At first glance, it may seem as if the Situ World Spiritist Clan had dropped their guard by leaving the gates open, but the truth was that they had constructed a detection formation to ensure that no one would be able to enter the premises without them noticing.

Under normal circumstances, Chu Feng wouldn’t have been able to circumvent the detection formation, but things were different now that he had learned Divine Concealment.

The combined prowess of Divine Concealment and his concealment formation allowed him to strut into the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s headquarters without anyone noticing.

As he walked through the corridors, he could tell that the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were in a jovial mood. They felt like they had finally recouped their lost dignity. They were either hurling insults at Chu Feng or complimenting Situ Kunye.

Situ Kunye was the current Situ World Spiritist Clan’s Clan Chief, as well as the son of the previous clan chief. He had been in closed-door training up till recently, and the first thing he did upon learning about Chu Feng was to summon all of their clansmen back and hang up the remains of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect’s members.

The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen felt that their clan chief was bringing honor back to their clan, which was why they were filled with praises for him.

By eavesdropping on their conversations, Chu Feng quickly learned that Situ Kunye was currently in the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s headquarters too. Knowing that he needed to gather more intelligence before concocting a plan, he decided to first look into how strong Situ Kunye currently was.

A group suddenly appeared before his eyes.

These people were previously in concealment, and it was only after entering the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s headquarters that they finally revealed themselves. They were all fairly powerful, especially their leader who happened to be a familiar face.

Yue Lian.

“That old thing has really chosen to collude with the Situ World Spiritist Clan.” Chu Feng’s killing intent flared.

Putting aside how Yue Lian was plotting to kill him, he couldn’t forgive what Yue Lian had done to Yue Ling either. He had long placed Yue Lian on his hit list. It was a pity that he was still too weak at the moment, or else he would have destroyed Yue Lian together with the Situ World Spiritist Clan in a single swoop.

That being said, Chu Feng’s concealment means were indeed formidable. Even an expert of Yue Lian’s caliber was unable to detect him. As long as Chu Feng didn’t make a careless move, Yue Lian wouldn’t be able to find him no matter how close they were to each other.

On top of that, Chu Feng now had the strongest token in his possession, and he was also aware that he had his father’s protection formation inside of him. That further emboldened him. He knew that he could at least ensure his own safety even if he was unable to kill Yue Lian and the World Spiritist Clan.

Thus, he decided to walk together with Yue Lian’s group.

Judging from his enraged look, Yue Lian was probably here to confront Situ Kunye over a disagreement. He disregarded all attempts to stop him and marched straight into the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s main hall.

“Lord Yue Lian, you’re here.”

The elders of the Situ World Spiritist Clan greeted Yue Lian with smiles, but it did little to placate Yue Lian’s anger.

“Call your darned little clan chief, Situ Kunye, here!” Yue Lian roared.

“Lord Yue Lian, Clan Chief Situ Kunye isn’t our little clan chief but our clan chief,” an elder corrected him.

“Screw you! Like hell I care whether he’s little or not. Call Situ Kunye out right now!” Yue Lian roared as he slammed his fist through one of the tables in the main hall.

“Lord Yue Lian, what brought about your fit of fury?” a voice echoed outside.

Moments later, a group entered the main hall. The one who had spoken earlier was Grand Elder Situ Tingye, but the one leading the group was a middle-aged man instead.

This middle-aged man was dressed in the robes of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but his garments were clearly much more delicate. Chu Feng could tell right away that he was the Situ World Spiritist Clan’s Clan Chief, Situ Kunye.

“You’re Situ Kunye?” Yue Lian glared at Situ Kunye with wrathful eyes.

“Yes, I am,” Situ Kunye replied with a smile.

He glanced at Situ Tingye, and the latter presented Yue Lian with an exquisite jar.

“Lord Yue Lian, this is a treasure passed down by our ancestors. It has the effect of nourishing a world spiritist’s bloodline. We have already unsealed the treasure, so please have a taste,” Situ Tingye said with a smile.

“Are you trying to bribe me with something like that? You must really take me for a countryside bumpkin!” Yue Lian sneered.

Having expected such a reaction, Situ Tingye uncorked the jar and a unique fragrance wafted out. Yue Lian widened his eyes in astonishment.

The jar was filled with quality stuff.

“Milord, this is Pulse Soothing Lotus Cream concocted by our ancestors. Unfortunately, we have already lost its recipe, so we don’t have much of it left in our clan. This cream is reserved solely for our most talented junior world spiritists to enjoy it. Not even grand elders like me are qualified to have a taste of it. You should quickly consume it, or else its effectiveness will be compromised,” Situ Tingye urged.

“I shan’t snub your kind intentions since you have already gone this far.”

Yue Lian took the jar and infused a sliver of his spirit power into it to check if there was any poison in it. A moment later, he breathed a sigh of relief and gulped down the Pulse Soothing Lotus Cream.

His lips curled into a satisfied smile. It would appear that the Pulse Soothing Lotus Cream was as delectable as it was nourishing to the body.

“How is it, Lord Yue Lian?” Situ Kunye asked.

“Mm. Not too bad.” Yue Lian’s anger finally quelled a little. He turned to Situ Kunye and asked, “Kunye, it’s not that I want to nag at you, but you shouldn’t take Chu Feng for a fool. Do you earnestly think that he’d charge right into his death like this? How do you expect to capture him now that you have summoned all of your clan members back to your headquarters?”

Yue Lian’s attitude was much better than before, but his words only made Situ Kunye sneer.

“Our Situ World Spiritist Clan wouldn’t have suffered such heavy losses if your method really worked. Are you asking me to turn a blind eye to the suffering of my clansmen? If you wish to kill Chu Feng, you can do it with your own means. Why should my clansmen die for your goal?” Situ Kunye replied with an accusatory tone.

Yue Lian’s temper immediately flared upon seeing Situ Kunye’s attitude. He rose to his feet and glared at Situ Kunye, bellowing, “What do you mean by that? I’m doing you a favor here, but you’re turning around to blame me for it?”

Situ Kunye wasn’t intimidated in the least.

“Don’t play the good man here. You aren’t helping us. You’re just using us to exact vengeance on Chu Feng. I, Situ Kunye, am the one who calls the shots in our Situ World Spiritist Clan. Don’t even think about telling me what to do. From now on, you’ll listen to me on how we’ll deal with Chu Feng,” Situ Kunye said.

“You want me to follow your orders? Who do you think you are?”

Yue Lian exerted the oppressive might of a rank five Half-God level cultivator, hoping to force the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen into submission. However, as soon as he did so, Situ Kunye released his oppressive might as well to curb his.

Situ Kunye was a rank five Half-God level cultivator too!

“It looks like I’ve underestimated you… but do you think that you’ll be a match for me just because of that?” Yue Lian harrumphed coldly.

He retracted his oppressive might and instead released his spirit power. He was a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, which meant that his spirit power was comparable to that of a rank six Half-God level cultivator.

Situ Kunye released his spirit power too, and once again, he managed to suppress Yue Lian.

Chu Feng frowned.

Situ Kunye was also a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. This was different from what the city lord had previously told him!
