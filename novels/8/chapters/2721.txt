Chapter 2721 - Undiscriminating

At that moment, Chu Xianshuo’s expression was very ugly. As a young master of the Chu Heavenly Clan, when had he ever been driven out by anyone?

However, even though he was feeling extremely displeased, there was nothing he could do. He knew very well that this Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was an eccentric old man. Someone like him was capable of doing all sorts of things. Thus... he could not afford to provoke him.

However, he couldn’t just drop the subject like this. Else, he, Chu Xianshuo, would be utterly humiliated.

Thinking of that, he turned his gaze toward Chu Feng again. He said, “Chu Feng, do you dare fight against me?”

“What a ridiculous thing to say. A rank four True Immortal is actually challenging a rank two True Immortal to a fight?”

“Chu Xianshuo, aren’t you clearly trying to bully him?”

“Or could it be that you really think yourself to be very impressive?” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

Although no one dared to echo in agreement, the crowd were all in approval of what the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.

Chu Xianshuo was much older than Chu Feng. With his age, even if his cultivation was two levels above Chu Feng, that didn’t count for much.

Yet, even though he clearly knew aware that his cultivation was higher than Chu Feng’s he was still trying to force Chu Feng fight him.

This was simply bullying another, something extremely disgraceful.

“Chu Feng, I am asking you whether or not you dare to fight me.”

However, Chu Xianshuo completely ignored the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master and turned to question Chu Feng again.

He must defeat Chu Feng. Otherwise, his face would be utterly lost. Should that happen, he would no longer be able to face anyone upon his return to the Chu Heavenly Clan.

“I’ll say it again. Please leave,” however, before Chu Feng could answer, the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master spoke again.

Furthermore, although his tone was still very calm, his voice was akin to a clap of thunder. His words echoed in the sky.

Furthermore, after saying those words, a boundless oppressive might also swept forth. That oppressive might covered the entire region.

Although his oppressive might was not targeting anyone, everyone present was able to sense how frightening that oppressive might was.

Although that oppressive might was intangible, it was akin to a giant mountain above the crowd’s heads. It was as if it would crush everyone to death should it descend even a bit more.

It was a fatal sensation. Should the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master desire it, all of the people present would instantly be crushed to death and turned to ashes.

No one would be able to survive.

In that place, the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was akin to a god. He was capable of taking away everyone’s lives with a single thought.

This was what it meant by a disparity in strength.

“So this is a Martial Immortal-level expert.”

At that moment, Chu Feng’s gaze was fixed onto the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

He had came to find out the cultivation of the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master from the bystanders’ discussions.

He was a Martial Immortal-level expert that had just reached a breakthrough. Thus, his current cultivation was rank five.

Rank five Martial Immortal, this was the cultivation of the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.

This level of cultivation would allow him to move about unhindered through the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.

He could be said to be an expert standing at the apex of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. He was truly a grand individual.

“Very well, I will remember what happened here today!”

Chu Xianshuo was fuming with rage between gritted teeth. However, he did not dare to do anything. He left threatening words behind, stared fiercely at Chu Feng, and then planned to turn to leave.

At that moment, the crowd all felt that Chu Xianshuo would not be able to do anything.

Since the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master planned to protect Chu Feng, Chu Xianshuo would not be able to do anything.

Not to mention Chu Xianshuo, with the strength and manner of conduct that the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master possessed, even experts from the Chu Heavenly Clan would not be able to do anything to Chu Feng unless they possessed sufficient strength.

“Wait.”

However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly said, “I, Chu Feng, accept your challenge.”

“Wha?”

“He accepted?”

“Am I mishearing things?”

“This Chu Feng actually accepted?”

“How could he dare to accept the challenge? Has he gone insane?”

The crowd present were all astonished after hearing Chu Feng accepting Chu Xianshuo’s challenge.

Chu Feng’s cultivation was rank two True Immortal, whereas Chu Xianshuo was a rank four True Immortal. How could Chu Feng possibly contend against Chu Xianshuo?

At that moment, the fiery red-haired old man spoke out, “Little friend Chu Feng, what Chu Xianshuo is proposing is a confrontation with martial power, and not world spirit techniques.”

“Are you certain that you haven’t misheard things?”

“Thank you, senior, for your kind reminder. However, this junior has not misheard things. I understand what Chu Xianshuo wants,” with a smile on his face, Chu Feng clasped his hand toward the fiery red-haired old man.

“Little friend Chu Feng, great courage. Seeing how courageous you are, this old man is willing to set up a formation for you.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“This formation is capable of allowing you to increase your cultivation to that of a rank four True Immortal for a short period of time.”

“With that, this match would become fair,” at that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master made a proposal.

“That’s right. With that, the match would be fair.”

“It would appear that the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master is determined to help that Chu Feng. He’s actually willing to set up a spirit formation to help Chu Feng increase his cultivation.”

“It would be our blessing to be able to personally witness the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master set up a spirit formation.”

“After all, what the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was truly powerful in was his world spirit techniques. He is a rarely-seen Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist in our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”

After the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master spoke his intention, many people’s eyes started to shine.

After all, he was not an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Instead, he was an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.

Exalted-cloak, that was a level completely above Immortal-cloak.

As for Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, that was the highest level of Exalt-cloak World Spiritist.

They were actually fortunate enough to witness a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist set up a spirit formation today.

To them, this was an honor. This was not something that they could witness any day.

“Damn it!”

At the moment when everyone was feeling joyous and excited, Chu Xianshuo was feeling extremely displeased.

It was not that he was afraid of Chu Feng. On the contrary, he possessed absolute confidence in his martial power and cultivation.

Thus, even though the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was planning to use his spirit formation to help Chu Feng increase his cultivation, Chu Xianshuo was still not afraid of Chu Feng.

However, he still felt extremely displeased to see that the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was planning to help Chu Feng like this.

After all, his behavior was clearly an act of confrontation toward him.

However, right at that moment, Chu Feng said, “Thank you for your kind intentions, Lord Villa Master. However, there really is no need for it.”

Chu Feng’s words came like a sudden clap of thunder. He immediately shocked everyone present.

Chu Feng... had actually refused the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master’s kind intentions.

“Little friend Chu Feng, could it be that you plan to contend against Chu Xianshuo, a rank four True Immortal, with your cultivation of a rank two True Immortal?” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master asked.

“Precisely,” Chu Feng answered.

“Ssssss~~~”

Once those words were said, many people were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.

While it was true that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were very powerful and his arrogance and conceit could be said to be confidence, there was a difference in strength even among those with the same level of cultivation.

If one were to be a level of cultivation weaker than one’s opponent, it would be a disparity that one could not make up for.

As for Chu Feng and Chu Xianshuo, there was a difference of two entire levels of cultivation between them. With such an enormous disparity, there was simply no way for Chu Feng to win.

The crowd was truly unable to understand where Chu Feng got his confidence to dare to act so arrogant and conceited.

No, rather than calling him arrogant and conceited, it was better to say that he was courting death.

“Little friend Chu Feng, it is best for you to not be undiscriminating. Our Lord Villa Master is trying to help you.”

At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa’s fiery red-haired old man narrowed his eyebrows and spoke in a displeased manner.

He felt that Chu Feng was simply unable to tell good from bad.
